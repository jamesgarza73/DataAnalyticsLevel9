New businesses will face extra bills of between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000 to gain a licence to trade while existing operators will be also checked to ensure they meet the standards before being formally registered by local environmental health officers. The government's food standards agency, which is already introducing compulsory licensing for 12,000 butchers this autumn, will draw up plans to spread the system throughout the food industry under a shake up of EU rules demanded by health and consumer protection commissioner David Byrne. The new regime may not be enforced until 2004 but Britain's food regulators welcomed its main proposals, which include extra duties on even the smallest retailers to check for bacterial contamination, and maintain proper freezing and cooking equipment. The requirements seem certain to provoke strong reactions from the food industry who fought off extra levies to help fund inspection procedures when the agency was being established. But the meat industry will welcome other rule changes which will reduce the need for vets to be present during slaughter in abattoirs and allow trained meat inspectors to be there instead.

More embarrassments will follow.</p> <p>The decision by one of his colleagues, Jestyn Thirkell-White, to speak out in today's Guardian is a warning to the agencies that their former employees are no longer prepared to keep mum.</p> <p>But Shayler remains the immediate cause of their serious concern. After obtaining an assurance from his lawyer that the crown prosecution service will not oppose bail, he told the Guardian last night he intends to return to Britain before the end of August.</p> <p>Neither MI5 nor MI6 are relishing the prospect of a high profile criminal trial where the allegations of a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy, and other items of the agencies' dirty linen will be exposed in court.</p> <p>If appeal court judges are prepared to stand up for exposing allegations of misdeeds by the agencies in the way Lord Justice Judge did yesterday, what will be the attitude of an Old Bailey jury?</p> <p>There are serious doubts within the government and MI5 about the wisdom of a trial. Any prosecution under the Official Secrets Act requires the consent of the attorney general, Lord Williams. Yet a decision not to prosecute Shayler would be tantamount to saying that the act is null and void.</p> <p>Though government lawyers privately believe the act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, which comes into force on October 2, they are not prepared to say so publicly and certainly do not want the Shayler case to kill it off.</p> <p>Shayler yesterday upped the ante by sending letters to every MP in which he says he is returning to Britain \"because I am a patriot not a traitor\". He adds: \"I believe in my country and its long tradition of parliamentary democracy and respect for the law. In this vein, I shall be submitting my evidence of the MI6-funded plot to assassinate Colonel Gadafy of Libya to the Intelligence and Security Committee, hopefully in person so I can also be examined on it.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday's judgment is the latest in a string of defeats for government lawyers in their increasingly desperate attempt to silence the MI5 renegade, David Shayler, and other whistleblowers from the security and intelligence agencies. More embarrassments will follow. The decision by one of his colleagues, Jestyn Thirkell-White, to speak out in today's Guardian is a warning to the agencies that their former employees are no longer prepared to keep mum. But Shayler remains the immediate cause of their serious concern. After obtaining an assurance from his lawyer that the crown prosecution service will not oppose bail, he told the Guardian last night he intends to return to Britain before the end of August. Neither MI5 nor MI6 are relishing the prospect of a high profile criminal trial where the allegations of a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy, and other items of the agencies' dirty linen will be exposed in court. If appeal court judges are prepared to stand up for exposing allegations of misdeeds by the agencies in the way Lord Justice Judge did yesterday, what will be the attitude of an Old Bailey jury? There are serious doubts within the government and MI5 about the wisdom of a trial. Any prosecution under the Official Secrets Act requires the consent of the attorney general, Lord Williams. Yet a decision not to prosecute Shayler would be tantamount to saying that the act is null and void. Though government lawyers privately believe the act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, which comes into force on October 2, they are not prepared to say so publicly and certainly do not want the Shayler case to kill it off. Shayler yesterday upped the ante by sending letters to every MP in which he says he is returning to Britain \"because I am a patriot not a traitor\". He adds: \"I believe in my country and its long tradition of parliamentary democracy and respect for the law. In this vein, I shall be submitting my evidence of the MI6-funded plot to assassinate Colonel Gadafy of Libya to the Intelligence and Security Committee, hopefully in person so I can also be examined on it. I have nothing to hide.\" He added: \"With my presence once again on British soil ... it will be increasingly difficult to ignore these issues ... I am returning to instigate open and informed debate, which cannot take place while I remain in France.\" A trial will prompt memories that Tony Blair and Jack Straw, the home secretary, among others now in government, opposed the Official Secrets Act when they were on the opposition front bench when the statute passed through the Commons in 1989. It will come in the wake of the government's failure to extradite Shayler from Paris after a French judge dismissed the move as politically-inspired. It will also follow a UN report calling for sweeping reforms of the security services and an end to gagging orders on whistleblowers who expose wrongdoing in MI5 and MI6. In words echoing those of the judges yesterday, the author of the UN report noted that the secrets act \"is used to stifle legitimate debate and to penalise writers and journalists who refuse to reveal their sources\". Covert surveillance The government faces the prospect of further embarrassment when Nigel Wylde, a former senior army officer, appears at the Old Bailey on November 20. He is a holder of the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing unexploded bombs in Northern Ireland. He has been charged under the Official Secrets Act for passing information to the journalist, Tony Geraghty, about covert surveillance systems used by the army. In his book, The Irish War - which is still on sale in bookshops - Geraghty describes how the army's systems \"provide total cover of a largely innocent population\". Wylde's trial is likely to take place before Shayler's. Lord Justice Judge yesterday went out of the way to emphasise the fundamental rights established through the centuries by English common law. However his point was addressed as much to the issue of self-incrimination as to freedom of expression. Yesterday's judgment may herald a more liberal approach by the courts. It may also herald a more benevolent attitude towards former members of the security and intelligence agencies who blow the whistle. What is certain is that the Wylde case is likely to provide the first concrete test of whether Britain's draconian secrets laws breach the Human Rights Act. The Ministry of Defence will be hard put to convince a jury that the disclosures damaged national security. Meanwhile, the MoD is preventing the Sunday Times from disclosing allegations made by a former member of the Force Research Unit, an undercover army intelligence unit in Northern Ireland. This week, Liam Clarke, the newspaper's Northern Ireland editor, was summoned for questioning by MoD police. The whistleblower has also been silenced. His house was burgled and the manuscript of a book he has written was stolen. His allegations relate to the involvement of the FRU and one of its informants - Brian Nelson, a former member of the Ulster Defence Association jailed for conspiracy to commit murder - in supplying information to a loyalist paramilitary group. At the last count, the MoD had obtained nine injunctions against former soldiers. The ministry's concern about more unwelcome disclosures about the activities of the SAS and other special forces lies behind their fierce opposition to the publication of the memoirs of the former head of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington. Though her book will in no way damage national security the MoD and MI6 argue it would be a dangerous precedent that would be used by other former members of the secret world. The concerns of MI6 may have led Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, to call on Dame Stella during a recent Commons debate \"to think again\" even though Jack Straw is responsible for MI5. Liberals in Whitehall - and there are some - argue that time, and now the law, is on their side. But not, it seems, until the government experiences some embarrassing secrets trials.",

There will be 6,000 new trains _ and money for safety, money for subsidy, money for Crossrail, money for the rich, money for the poor, money for speeding new trains faster than fairies, faster than witches along smooth welded tracks between hedges and ditches.

A half-cock \"modernisation plan\", implemented haphazardly from 1955 had meanwhile seen no great increase in speed or reliability, or at least not nearly great enough to counteract the effectiveness of new motorways and inter-city jets. The country's railways were not in a particularly good state at the time of the Beeching report, but nor had they been since the beginning of the first world war. Whether privately or publicly run, they were chronically underfunded and, with a few notable bursts of electrical energy (the Southern Railway under Sir Herbert Walker), stolid, old-fashioned and in constant danger of being undermined not by the exploitation of coal seams beneath the hammering wheels of their coal- powered trains, but by cars and planes.</p> <p>Our recently privatised train operating companies are a very mixed bag. Would you trust billions of pounds of money from the public purse to companies that would get short shrift in Thomas the Tank Engine's fictional Isle of Sodor and shorter shrift still in Japan where the railways have been privatised fairly successfully? Probably not. So, who can we trust if not in Railtrack or the train companies? Stewart Francis, chairman of the Rail Passengers Council, says: \"We need the right management, the right train companies, and the right regulation.\" Of course, of course. But who will ensure that you, I and Mr Francis gets these things? Sir Alastair Morton, perhaps, of Eurotunnel fame, and his Strategic Rail Authority (aka British Railways Board), but this has too little power, influence or money to keep our unruly pirate railways in check. And how can Sir Alastair convince us that the new breed of railway management is more genuinely interested in running railways than in talking US-management talk, inventing imaginative \"remuneration packages\" and handsome \"retirement packages\" for itself and patronising the rest of us by calling us \"customers\" and nurturing an annoying faux airline culture? Thomas has fewer troubles with his recalcitrant trucks than Sir Alastair may yet have with train companies more interested in the desires of shareholders than the needs of passengers.</p> <p>It might be better if the railways were renationalised and one responsible, publicly accountable body was entrusted to spend the Prescott billions on improving trains and services. Our record, however, public or private, has been rather dismal over the past 80 years. Escaping nationalisation in the first world war, the railways were grouped into the \"big four\" (Great Western, Southern, London Midland &amp; Scottish and London &amp; North Eastern) and regulated as far as charging went by the Railway Rates Tribunal. Despite some glamorous escapades in terms of 100mph art deco steam streamliners and the Southern's steady electrification, the big four were hard pressed to turn a profit. They managed 2-3% on preference shares and then not every year. With the decline of heavy industry in the north-east, the LNER (\"the Late and Never Early\") failed to pay dividends between the wars. Its directors, despite braying \"no to nationalisation\" in public were secretly relieved when the state took control on January 1 1948.</p> <p>Immediately before the creation of British Railways and its apocryphal sandwiches, the wartime coalition government considered a Railtrack-plus-the-big four type operation, but plumped for full nationalisation instead. Did this help? To an extent. Up until 1953 the heavily used railways made a profit, but modernisation, although sincere, was slow in coming.</p> <p>The railways were hidebound and many of their best managers had refused to be nationalised. Even though labour was slowly raising its value, the railways relied on much technology based on the crude exploitation of skilled labour. Men were expected to perform grimy jobs that elsewhere, in the United States and Europe, had been mechanised.</p> <p>Even so, by the time Mrs Thatcher did her worst, British Rail was turning itself, lock, stock and air-brake compressor, into a modern, commercially driven network, with strategically marketed sectors such as Inter-City turning a profit. The Railways Act of 1993, however, did for the railways and all thoughts of an integrated national transport network. A concupiscent drive for private gain among a new generation of directors and shareholders and a disturbing decline in the status, training and morale of staff - when were engine drivers last working-class heroes? - saw our railways reach a nadir, via Southall (September 1997) and Paddington (October 1999). Then John Prescott, with an eye on the next general election, announced his \u00a360bn hand out. There are many of us who wouldn't trust a British train company to get us anywhere on time in any style in these islands.

They managed 2-3% on preference shares and then not every year. With the decline of heavy industry in the north-east, the LNER (\"the Late and Never Early\") failed to pay dividends between the wars. Its directors, despite braying \"no to nationalisation\" in public were secretly relieved when the state took control on January 1 1948. Immediately before the creation of British Railways and its apocryphal sandwiches, the wartime coalition government considered a Railtrack-plus-the-big four type operation, but plumped for full nationalisation instead. Did this help? To an extent. Up until 1953 the heavily used railways made a profit, but modernisation, although sincere, was slow in coming. The railways were hidebound and many of their best managers had refused to be nationalised. Even though labour was slowly raising its value, the railways relied on much technology based on the crude exploitation of skilled labour. Men were expected to perform grimy jobs that elsewhere, in the United States and Europe, had been mechanised. Even so, by the time Mrs Thatcher did her worst, British Rail was turning itself, lock, stock and air-brake compressor, into a modern, commercially driven network, with strategically marketed sectors such as Inter-City turning a profit. The Railways Act of 1993, however, did for the railways and all thoughts of an integrated national transport network. A concupiscent drive for private gain among a new generation of directors and shareholders and a disturbing decline in the status, training and morale of staff - when were engine drivers last working-class heroes? - saw our railways reach a nadir, via Southall (September 1997) and Paddington (October 1999). Then John Prescott, with an eye on the next general election, announced his \u00a360bn hand out. There are many of us who wouldn't trust a British train company to get us anywhere on time in any style in these islands. Oh, Mr Prescott, what shall we do? jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The appeal court yesterday roundly dismissed attempts by the police and state prosecutors to order the Guardian and the Observer to hand over any information they may possess relating to the former MI5 officer, David Shayler, including a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy. In a ringing defence of press freedom and the newspapers' right to publish allegations by whistleblowers, Lord Justice Judge told the court: \"Inconvenient or embarrassing revelations, whether for the security services or for public authorities, should not be suppressed\". Otherwise, he said \"legitimate inquiry and discussion\" and the \"safety valve of effective investigative journalism\" would be \"discouraged, perhaps stifled\". He pointed to what he called the alarming allegation that MI6 was involved in a failed plot to kill the Libyan leader in 1996 which led to the deaths of innocent bystanders, an allegation described by Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, as \"pure fantasy\". If true, the judge said, it was difficult to overestimate its enormity. If false, the allegations were inevitably damaging. Yet their refutation was also a matter of public importance. \"Unless there are compelling reasons of national security, the public is entitled to know the facts and, as the eyes and ears of the public, journalists are entitled to investigate and report the facts...\" said the judge. The two principles of freedom of speech and the right of protection against self-incrimination, the judge said, were \"bred in the bone of the common law\", let alone established in the European convention on human rights. \"Premises are not to be entered into by the forces of authority or the state to deter or diminish, inhibit or stifle the exercise of an individual's right to free speech or the press of its freedom to investigate and inform,\" said the judge. He criticised the failure of the police special branch to explain convincingly why they needed an emailed letter sent to the Guardian in February and any notes in the possession of Martin Bright, an Observer journalist, relating to Mr Shayler's allegations about the Gadafy plot. Disclosure orders should be made only when there was \"compelling evidence\" in the public interest. He also pointed to the prosecution's failure to give an undertaking that journalists on the newspapers, notably Mr Bright, would not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if they handed over any material. The judge was supported by Mr Justice Gibbs though the third member of the court, Mr Justice Maurice Kay, ruled against the newspapers. Initially, all three judges said the Observer newspaper should provide the police with any copy of a letter Mr Shayler sent to Jack Straw, the home secretary, last year giving details about the Libyan plot. They dropped that demand when the newspaper said it would sign an affidavit saying it was not in its possession. In a statement after the judgment, the newspapers said: \"This is a judgment with profound implications for press freedom and shows that the Guardian and Observer were fully justified in fighting this case.\" John Wadham, Mr Shayler's lawyer and director of Liberty, the civil liberties group, said: \"The court has taken a very important step to protect freedom of expression.

The dome has raised only \u00a385m in commercial income so far this year - less than half a predicted income revenue of \u00a3194m - because total spending by visitors is now expected to be less than half what was originally forecast. The revelation was made in the third annual report of the company which runs the Greenwich site, the New Millennium Experience Company. It blamed the financial difficulties on the strong pound and \"negative media coverage\". The report predicted that without a change in circumstances the dome was likely to need extra funding to remain open until the end of the year. The warning came despite the award of \u00a329m from the National Lottery in May, which came on top of the \u00a3496m of lottery funds already committed to the dome. A source at the Millennium Commission - in charge of handing out lottery cash - said that it would be \"politically difficult\" for any further funds to be made available, but refused to rule out the possibility. A spokesman for the NMEC said: \"It is not our intention to ask for further money. At this stage we are confident we will achieve visitor targets, make the necessary cuts and get \u00a330m from the legacy sale.\" The NMEC's 74-page report revealed that the dome's total income over this year is now estimated to be \u00a3761m, with another \u00a33m set aside to promote and market the attraction. The significant reduction in the estimates of commercial income reflect the halving of the paying visitor target from 12m to 6m. The accounts indicate that the original \u00a3399m of lottery money received by NMEC had now risen to a net figure of \u00a3525m, including the additional grants of \u00a360m in February and \u00a329m in May.

It was totally disproportionate to the alleged offence. MI5 and special branch were acting like the very police state they are supposed to be protecting us from.\"</p> <p>Mr Thirkell-White, who resigned from MI5 in 1996 and now works as a banker, says: \"I do not accept Jack Straw's statements that Shayler's revelations have in any way damaged national security.\" This included Mr Shayler's claim that the sister overseas espionage organisation, MI6, had colluded in an assassination plot by opponents of Col Gadafy in Libya, and that Libyan intelligence officers had been active in London.</p> <p>Mr Thirkell-White also agrees that the organisation has been in desperate need of reform and modernisation.</p> <p>\"When David went public, I expected an independent inquiry, because the allegations were serious enough to warrant proper investigation: instead, MI5 appointed a former deputy director, John Alpass, who was a friend and colleague of MI5 chief Steven Lander, to conduct a broad review of all three intelligence organisations - MI5, MI6 and GCQ.

MI5 were desperate to keep their new role and en sure the special branch could not regain that role. They were desperate to ensure the special branch could not point to any procedural mistake.\"</p> <p>Mr Thirkell-White joined MI5 from Cambridge alongside Mr Shayler in 1991. Like him, he was startled to discover the archaic nature of the organisation. Officers still wrote out reports in longhand, for a secretary to draft and then retype after laborious corrections. \"It was appallingly inefficient.\"</p> <p>\"A lot of officers were asked to write endless briefings, just to generate work. It was too hierarchical, and too many layers of management.\"</p>",

MI5 and special branch were acting like the very police state they are supposed to be protecting us from.\" Mr Thirkell-White, who resigned from MI5 in 1996 and now works as a banker, says: \"I do not accept Jack Straw's statements that Shayler's revelations have in any way damaged national security.\" This included Mr Shayler's claim that the sister overseas espionage organisation, MI6, had colluded in an assassination plot by opponents of Col Gadafy in Libya, and that Libyan intelligence officers had been active in London. Mr Thirkell-White also agrees that the organisation has been in desperate need of reform and modernisation. \"When David went public, I expected an independent inquiry, because the allegations were serious enough to warrant proper investigation: instead, MI5 appointed a former deputy director, John Alpass, who was a friend and colleague of MI5 chief Steven Lander, to conduct a broad review of all three intelligence organisations - MI5, MI6 and GCQ. That was quite wrong.\" Mr Thirkell-White and Mr Shayler served together in T Branch (anti-terrorism), where Mr Thirkell-White was trying to block flows of arms and money to the IRA from Eastern Europe and the US. He backs up one of Mr Shayler's most seemingly bizarre allegations - that MI5 officers wasted vital hours in the search for IRA bombers dickering about the wording of warrants, because of bureaucratic \"turf wars\" with the police special branch. MI5 had successfully seized control of anti-IRA operations from the police in the early 1990s, while searching for a new role at the end of the cold war. \"The endless redrafting was nothing to do with protecting people's civil liberties. MI5 were desperate to keep their new role and en sure the special branch could not regain that role. They were desperate to ensure the special branch could not point to any procedural mistake.\" Mr Thirkell-White joined MI5 from Cambridge alongside Mr Shayler in 1991. Like him, he was startled to discover the archaic nature of the organisation. Officers still wrote out reports in longhand, for a secretary to draft and then retype after laborious corrections. \"It was appallingly inefficient.\" \"A lot of officers were asked to write endless briefings, just to generate work. It was too hierarchical, and too many layers of management.\"",

      "bodyText": "Israeli ministers abandoned the sacred shibboleth of Jerusalem as the \"undivided and eternal capital of the Jewish people\" in a first tentative attempt to soften up their public for a compromise with the Palestinians on the most explosive topic at the Camp David summit in the US. In interviews, Rabbi Michael Melchior, a cabinet minister and part of Ehud Barak's public relations team at the summit, said the Israeli prime minister was considering a US formula for sharing sovereignty with the Palestinians in parts of Arab East Jerusalem, an nexed by the Jewish state after the 1967 war. \"We're talking about a US proposal which accepts the Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as an undivided city and has some signs of joint sovereignty, expanded self- administration, of some of the Arab Muslim quarters in the outskirts of Jerusalem,\" Mr Melchior told BBC television. A senior Palestinian official spelled out more clearly than ever before last night that the Palestinians were ready to recognise Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem. Hassan Abdel-Rahman, the PLO representative in Washington, said: \"Our position remains _ that we recognise Is raeli full sovereignty over West Jerusalem in return for full Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\" That Mr Barak would even dare to consider such an idea represents the crumbling of a taboo. At the US presidential retreat this week, he became the first Israeli leader ever to discuss the city's future with the Palestinians - \"an act from which there can be no return\", the historian and former deputy mayor of the city, Meron Benvenisti, wrote in Ha'aretz newspaper. Mr Melchior's statement - speedily denied by a member of the negotiating team at Camp David - follows a now familiar pattern in seven years of peace talks of deliberate leaks from Israeli politicians meant to gauge domestic public opinion to possible comprises. In the scant details that emerged yesterday, the US formula appears virtually identical to proposals on sharing the city quietly put forward by liberal Israeli academics. Although Israeli and Palestinian cartographers and academics have been quietly discussing ways of sharing the city for some time, in public, at least, Israeli politicians cling to the mantra that Jewish sovereignty over the entire city is an immutable fact. \"This is a kind of a breakthrough on Israel's systematic policies on the city,\" said Manuel Hassassian of Bethlehem university, who has been advising Palestinian representatives. \"For Palestinians, such statements are encouraging.\" But the statements caused immediate outrage among rightwing Israelis, who accuse Mr Barak of plotting to forsake the city they see as a biblical birthright. It is unclear how a polarised Israeli public would greet an agreement that involved giving up land within city limits. Despite the collapse of Mr Barak's coalition on the eve of the summit, he soldiered on, claiming Israelis were with him. But opinion polls in two Israeli newspapers yesterday suggest support for Mr Barak, and a negotiated peace, appears to be eroding. In a survey in Yediot Ahronot, 70% of those polled opposed the return of any part of east Jerusalem to the Palestinians. However, a poll in the Ma'ariv newspaper found that even though the public was uneasy about Mr Barak's leadership, and the prospects of a lasting peace with the Palestinians, when push came to shove, some 45% would still vote in favour of a peace agreement in a referendum. The US proposal hinges on expanding the limits of Jerusalem to take in Jewish settlements in the West Bank while offering the Palestinians control over municipal services in neighbourhoods in the north of the city. It would stave off the most contentious questions about the city's future - control over the holy relics of Islam, Christianity and Judaism, within the old city walls - until a permanent settlement is reached. However, Palestinians would be offered a passage to the al-Aqsa mosque - the third holiest Muslim shrine - perhaps via an underground tunnel beneath the Mount of Olives.",

      "bodyText": "The world's seven richest industrialised nations yesterday failed to agree any new proposals to breathe life into their flagging plans to relieve the third world's debt burden. Despite efforts by Tony Blair to persuade his fellow G7 leaders to do more to respond to campaigners around the globe calling for a fairer deal for developing nations, they settled for restating the intention to implement an agreement reached last year in Cologne. Revealing the frustration felt by the premier at his failure to reinvigorate the initiative, Mr Blair's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: \"He does feel that we could and should have made further progress but no-one should underestimate the progress already made.\" Mr Blair, who has received 250,000 postcards and emails from drop-the-debt campaigners in three months, chaired the discussion of the subject at the G7's annual summit on the Japanese island of Okinawa. But Britain's enthusiasm to respond to public opinion by granting faster, deeper and broader debt relief was not shared by his counterparts, Bill Clinton, of the United States, Japan's Yoshiro Mori, Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, France's Jacques Chirac, Canada's Jean Chretien and Italy's Giuliano Amato. At the end of their talks, the G7 issued a statement saying they would work together to ensure the targets set last year were met, giving due consid eration to economic reform in the eligible countries. Acknowledging that the debt relief process had been hindered by frustrating bureaucratic delays, Mr Campbell conceded that the best that could now be hoped for was a strong message of political commitment to make faster progress in the final summit communique to be issued on Sunday. During the rest of the summit, Mr Blair will also push for the establishment of a high-level group of politicians to persuade warring countries in Africa to put down their arms in exchange for debt relief. Ann Pettifor, director of Jubilee 2000, the global coalition of charities which has led the campaign for debt relief, said: \"This summit offered the chance to go further and write off all the unpayable debts of the poorest countries - a genuine new start. The world's leaders have blown it. \"While we welcome the encouragement given to poor countries to end war, we believe that the G7 could play a more decisive role in conflict countries, by ending arms sales to these regimes. Debt cancellation must not be held hostage to the international arms trade.\" Henry Northover, policy analyst with the UK aid agency Cafod, added: \"This summit is a \u00a3500m blowout for the world's most powerful men and nothing new for the world's poor.\" The Birmingham summit two years ago cost \u00a36.5m. Tonight the G7 leaders, plus Russia's Vladimir Putin, at tending his first summit, are due to sit down to a gala banquet with lobster, caviar and duck on the menu at Shurijo Castle, a 15th century palace. Ms Pettifor said: \"This reminds me of Marie Antoinette dining at her table and when the poor of Paris banged on her door she said let them eat cake.\" Under the agreement reached at Cologne last year, the G7 committed themselves to cancelling debts worth $100bn and said they expected 24 of the eligible 41 countries to begin receiving some form of debt service relief by the end of this year. So far nine have begun to receive debt relief. Jubilee 2000 estimates that less than $12bn of the $100bn total has been cancelled and that most of that was already in the pipeline before Cologne.

Jack Straw wasn't actually driving the car, but he has been unequivocal in his belief in the need for \"zero tolerance\" towards speeding motorists. He backed a senior police officer's call last year for the prosecution of drivers exceeding the limit by a mere 1mph. Mr Straw's car is alleged to have been travelling at over 100mph.</p> <p>Avon and Somerset police have yet to decide whether they will be taking any further action. But they do not have any choice. Of course they have discretion, but imagine the political fuss if they dropped the case. True, John Redwood rushed in to suggest the special branch officer driving the car should not be prosecuted. But there will be plenty of other Tories rightly shouting \"foul\" if there is no prosecution.

      "bodyText": "It is difficult to guess who was more shocked - the police officer who stopped the speeding car on the M5 only to find the home secretary inside; or Jack Straw, who would have immediately known just how much media attention his speeding car was going to make. The list of speeding motorists covers all classes: politicians (John Prescott - 85mph on the M62), sports people (Lester Piggott, Ian Botham), performers (Terry Wogan, Rowan Atkinson), and royalty (Princess Ann). Jack Straw wasn't actually driving the car, but he has been unequivocal in his belief in the need for \"zero tolerance\" towards speeding motorists. He backed a senior police officer's call last year for the prosecution of drivers exceeding the limit by a mere 1mph. Mr Straw's car is alleged to have been travelling at over 100mph. Avon and Somerset police have yet to decide whether they will be taking any further action. But they do not have any choice. Of course they have discretion, but imagine the political fuss if they dropped the case. True, John Redwood rushed in to suggest the special branch officer driving the car should not be prosecuted. But there will be plenty of other Tories rightly shouting \"foul\" if there is no prosecution. Mr Straw wasn't even travelling on government business, but was late for a meeting of the Labour party's national policy forum in Exeter. This is hard luck on the officer involved, but it will at least reinforce the readiness of other Whitehall drivers to remember the rules of the road.

Mr McCain is among a number of senior Republicans who have been asked to remain available for phone calls from Mr Bush this weekend, as the Texas governor prepares to announce who will accompany him to the Republican convention in Philadelphia on July 31. Whether he is willing to take a chance on Mr McCain remains a closely guarded secret, but that has done nothing to dampen the sudden surge of speculation that he may pull a spectacular surprise. Mr McCain appeared to rule himself out as a running mate after Mr Bush defeated him in the frequently bitter primary struggle in March. When they finally met in private in Pittsburgh two months ago, Mr McCain repeated that he did not wish to be considered, and Mr Bush has said that he takes his former rival at his word. But Mr McCain appears to have done a spectacular about-face in recent days, and his supporters are making an 11th-hour lobbying effort to have his name added to the ticket - a step that would undoubtedly alarm conservative Republicans, to say nothing of the Democratic challenger, Al Gore. The speculation seems to have been triggered by a phone call on Tuesday to Mr McCain from Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, himself a leading candidate for the job. He urged Mr McCain to take the number-two position on the Republican ticket if it was offered. He made it clear that he was not speaking on Mr Bush's behalf. \"You know me, Tommy. If the governor asked me, you know I would serve. I would prefer not to, but I'll serve,\" the Associated Press reported Mr McCain was reported as saying. \"If Bush were to make a case, he would do it, but he prefers not to be asked,\" a McCain adviser told the Washington Post. Reports of that conversation were quickly followed by the news that Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, leader of the Republican effort to keep control of the house in November's elections, was circulating a petition in support of drafting Mr McCain. He sees the Arizona senator as a trump card in the battle for swing voters. Campaign officials have hinted several times this week that Mr Bush may announce his choice on Monday, a week before the convention, to maximise the media coverage.",

      "bodyText": "US officials said yesterday that Washington was puzzled but ready, in principle, to assist North Korea in developing its own space programme if Pyongyang gave up its efforts to develop long-range missiles. North Korea's communist regime, slowly beginning to come out of its isolation, has not previously been known for its aspirations to space travel. But its \"Dear Leader\", Kim Jong-il, has made his desire for space technology a condition for giving up tests of his country's experimental missiles. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who visited Pyongyang last week, was reported to have put the North Korean plan to his US counterpart, Bill Clinton at a 75-minute meeting yesterday before the Okinawa G8 economic summit. North Korea's missile programme is cited by Washington as a key reason for its proposed US national missile defence system (NMD), elements of which would be based in Alaska. In Asia and in Europe the idea is controversial. In a separate bilateral meeting in Okinawa,Tony Blair last night urged Mr Putin to pressure rogue states like North Korea to adopt more conventional norms, as a way of discouraging the Americans from pressing ahead with the defence grid. If Mr Putin could bring North Korea to heel, there might be less political pressure on Washington to bolster US defences, Mr Blair told the Russian leader. Senior British government officials said North Korea's proposal to trade its missile programme for space technology was a positive development which warranted careful consideration by Nato. This response echoed Washington's uncertain welcome. \"It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong-il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,\" a senior American official who attended the meeting said. The official was quoted as saying the US was willing to explore the idea if Pyongyang abandoned its missile programme entirely and if the help it sought on space exploration was in the form of aid for North Korea to launch its satellites using rockets built and fired by other states. The US would provide the country no assistance to make or launch its own rockets, he added. North Korea shocked everyone when it test-fired a ballistic missile over Japan in 1998. Pyongyang said the rocket it launched was a space shot aimed at putting a satellite in orbit, but the claim was greeted with ridicule. In agreeing to discuss Kim Jong-il's bizarre offer, Washington risked handing ammunition to Moscow and other opponents of NMD, whose proponents say is designed to protect the US from missile attacks by \"rogue states\" - North Korea being the most frequently cited example. China believes the proposed system is really aimed at it. NMD is opposed by Russia, China and some US allies in Europe, including France and Germany, on the grounds that it violates the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty, and is therefore destabilising. The US argument has been that \"rogue states\" cannot be contained by the principles of mutual deterrence, of which the 1972 treaty is a central pillar. If the threat posed by the North Koreans - who could be capable of launching a missile attack by 2005, according to US intelligence - appears to be receding, one of the premises underpinning the NMD scheme would vanish. However, proponents of the $60bn (\u00a340bn) anti-missile defence shield maintain that Iran and Iraq could pose a ballistic missile threat within the next few years and say they are also concerned that there may be an accidental nuclear missile launch by an established power like Russia, whose defence system is crumbling. Mr Clinton is under congressional pressure to give development of the anti-missile shield a green light by November to allow completion of the first phase by 2005, but two out of three tests of the system over the past year have failed, putting the timetable in doubt.",

She claimed she had only agreed to be a drugs mule because she was short of cash and was desperate to get home.</p> <p>She was arrested by Thai authorities with her travelling companion Robert Lock as they checked in for a flight to Japan.</p> <p>At their trial, Gregory was sentenced to 25 years in prison - later reduced to 22 years - and Lock walked free.</p> <p>When she was released from prison yesterday afternoon she said: \"It is absolutely marvellous. I was not expecting it at all and am humbled by it. I have learned an awful lot in the past seven and a half years. It has given me empathy with other people. I think more than anybody I would like to thank my parents for everything they have done. They have been great.\" She said she accepted full responsibility for her actions. \"I was guilty of breaking the law in Thailand and I take full responsibility for what I have done,\" she said. \"I still think Thailand is a marvellous country. I have been smiling for 24 hours, but it's hard to make plans.\"</p> <p>She could not go back to teaching because she had a criminal record. She would like to work in drug rehabilitation.</p> <p>Her parents, Doreen and Stan, from Aberdeenshire, have conducted a campaign to secure her release. They appealed to the government and the king of Thailand for clemency. Their appeal was supported by church leaders in Scotland and by politicians.</p> <p>They claim that their daughter, who is now 35, had been the longest serving woman prisoner in Britain apart from serial killers Rosemary West and Myra Hindley.</p> <p>She had spent four and a half years in the notorious Lar Yao women's prison - sometimes dubbed the Bangkok Hilton - before being returned to Britain under a prisoner exchange treaty in 1997.</p> <p>Her mother said the worst moment came when Sandra was transferred to the maximum security wing at Durham prison in 1998. Sandra wrote to her parents saying she was in a cell \"like a gerbil cage\" and that she was frightened. She had portrayed the system as being like slow torture. \"Being kept alive to suffer slowly,\" she wrote. \"Killed from the inside out.\"</p> <p>Gregory was transferred to last autumn to Cookham Wood, where she began an Open University degree course. She would not have been eligible for parole until December 2003.</p> <p>Yesterday her parents were jubilant. Her mother was outside the prison gates. She said: \"The whole prison is rejoicing. We were completely stunned when we heard the news. It is the first time in eight years that I have been able to smile.\"</p> <p>They were phoned at home by the Foreign Office on Thursday evening.</p> <p>Malcolm Bruce, their local MP, said: \"Stan and Doreen have fought a wonderful campaign. The dignified way in which they have conducted themselves has been crucial in mobilising cross-party support.\"</p> <p>James MacKay, an elder of the Church of Scotland, who campaigned for Sandra's release, said: \"It is terrible that the government has done so little to help.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said it had not supported the application for a royal pardon, which would only have been endorsed on compelling or compassionate grounds.</p>",

She was released from Cookham Wood prison in Kent, where she has spent the last nine months of her sentence, after she was pardoned by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Gregory, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, was jailed in 1993 after she admitted smuggling 86.9 grammes of heroin which she had hidden in her body in a condom. She claimed she had only agreed to be a drugs mule because she was short of cash and was desperate to get home. She was arrested by Thai authorities with her travelling companion Robert Lock as they checked in for a flight to Japan. At their trial, Gregory was sentenced to 25 years in prison - later reduced to 22 years - and Lock walked free. When she was released from prison yesterday afternoon she said: \"It is absolutely marvellous. I was not expecting it at all and am humbled by it. I have learned an awful lot in the past seven and a half years. It has given me empathy with other people. I think more than anybody I would like to thank my parents for everything they have done. They have been great.\" She said she accepted full responsibility for her actions. \"I was guilty of breaking the law in Thailand and I take full responsibility for what I have done,\" she said. \"I still think Thailand is a marvellous country. I have been smiling for 24 hours, but it's hard to make plans.\" She could not go back to teaching because she had a criminal record. She would like to work in drug rehabilitation. Her parents, Doreen and Stan, from Aberdeenshire, have conducted a campaign to secure her release. They appealed to the government and the king of Thailand for clemency. Their appeal was supported by church leaders in Scotland and by politicians. They claim that their daughter, who is now 35, had been the longest serving woman prisoner in Britain apart from serial killers Rosemary West and Myra Hindley. She had spent four and a half years in the notorious Lar Yao women's prison - sometimes dubbed the Bangkok Hilton - before being returned to Britain under a prisoner exchange treaty in 1997. Her mother said the worst moment came when Sandra was transferred to the maximum security wing at Durham prison in 1998. Sandra wrote to her parents saying she was in a cell \"like a gerbil cage\" and that she was frightened. She had portrayed the system as being like slow torture. \"Being kept alive to suffer slowly,\" she wrote. \"Killed from the inside out.\" Gregory was transferred to last autumn to Cookham Wood, where she began an Open University degree course. She would not have been eligible for parole until December 2003. Yesterday her parents were jubilant. Her mother was outside the prison gates. She said: \"The whole prison is rejoicing. We were completely stunned when we heard the news. It is the first time in eight years that I have been able to smile.\" They were phoned at home by the Foreign Office on Thursday evening. Malcolm Bruce, their local MP, said: \"Stan and Doreen have fought a wonderful campaign. The dignified way in which they have conducted themselves has been crucial in mobilising cross-party support.\" James MacKay, an elder of the Church of Scotland, who campaigned for Sandra's release, said: \"It is terrible that the government has done so little to help.\" A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said it had not supported the application for a royal pardon, which would only have been endorsed on compelling or compassionate grounds.",

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton tried to win over the people of Okinawa yesterday by a direct address to the island, which houses the biggest concentration of American firepower outside the United States. Arriving on Japan's southernmost island for the summit of the G8 group of leading industrial states and Russia, Mr Clinton spoke a day after 27,000 peace campaigners formed a chain around Okinawa's largest US base. It was the biggest protest against the American military presence on the island since 1995, a reminder to Mr Clinton - the first US president to visit Okinawa in more than 40 years - of the feeling of many residents that Okinawa's share is disproportionate to that of the rest of Japan. There are 26,000 US troops in Okinawa, more than half American personnel in Japan, though it comprises only 1% of the country's landmass. Many of the bases were taken by American forces after the 1945 battle of Okinawa, the bloodiest confrontation of the second world war in the Pacific. Speaking at a memorial to the 200,000 who died in the battle, Mr Clinton said the presence of US troops on the island was playing a vital part in ensuring stability and peace in Asia. He recognised, however, that local people - whose island is considered an unsinkable battleship by Washington - did not ask to play such a role. \"I have tried to understand your concerns,\" he said. \"We are going to keep doing what we can to reduce our footprint on the island.\" His opponents said this vague promise merely reaffirmed the 1996 Japan-US agreement to consolidate some bases. In four years, little has been done about it, partly because the islanders cannot agree. \"This is a huge disappointment,\" said Seicchi Sakugawa, whose family home was torn down to make way for the Kadena airbase. \"He used nice words, but what he said was that Okinawans will have to go on living with the burden of the bases for years to come.\" But not everyone is against the bases. Landowners receive generous rents and many shops and bars depend on business from the troops. But the resentment resurfaced in June when a US marine broke into the bedroom of a 14-year-old Okinawa girl and tried to molest her. The military authorities were also embarrassed by a hit-and-run incident involving an airman from Kadena earlier this month. These crimes revived memories of the rape five years ago of a girl of 12. That sparked protests by 80,000 people. The military authorities have introduced a midnight curfew and restricted flights to try to ease the tension, but political and economic factors have given fresh momentum to the movement against the bases. The Tokyo government pays a contribution for the US bases which underpin its security, the Japanese armed forces having been restricted since the war. And Tokyo shares Washington's concern about China. But to Okinawans these are not the paramount concern. \"Japan is in recession, so it cannot afford to keep the bases,\" said Kiyomi Tsujimoto, a social democratic MP. \"And now that relations between North and South Korea have improved, we must ask whether we really need such a strong military presence.\" Mr Clinton has not endeared himself to his Japanese hosts by arriving late and hinting that he will fly home early - in both cases because he is hoping to salvage some sort of agreement from the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks at Camp David. The G8 summit was supposed to be the islanders' reward for putting up with the US troop presence. \"These are empty gestures,\" said Kiyoko Miyagi, a resident. \"The only good thing that has come out of this summit is that the world has a chance to see what wars and occupation have done to our beautiful and peace-loving island.\"",

The immigration minister, Barbara Roche, said in a speech in Paris yesterday that the government believed it was time to start a debate on finding ways to meet \"legitimate desires to migrate\" to Britain and called for an \"imaginative rethink\" of existing immigration rules so migration could meet economic and social needs. She wanted to see \"innovators with good ideas to take the economy forward\" and add to national wealth, as well skilled specialists come to Britain. It is thought that ministers are more inclined to an extension of the current overseas workers scheme which enables some specialists in shortage occupations to work in Britain rather than a major relaxation of the 1971 Immigration Act which effectively bans primary immigration. The Home Office is believed to be looking at a limited version of the Canadian scheme under which 200,000 migrants will enter Canada this year.

He was also found guilty of affray on board the jet. The jury reached its verdict on Connors after deliberating for seven hours. Francis Coyle, 40, also of Lewisham, was found not guilty of endangering the aircraft but was later found guilty of affray on board the flight.

      "bodyText": "General anaesthetics are to be banned from use in dental surgeries following the deaths of eight patients, five of them children, in the past four years. Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical officer, announced the step yesterday because a succession of expert reports and guidelines has not stopped the death toll. From January 2002, any patients who genuinely need a general anaesthetic for dental work, such as some children with special needs, will have to be admitted to hospital. \"We are bringing to an end general anaesthetics in the dentist's chair which have been responsible for a small number of tragic deaths, many involving children,\" Professor Donaldson said. The decision follows a review of the evidence, that he chaired jointly with the chief dental officer, Robin Wild. The report recommends that alternative methods of pain and anxiety control should be used to further reduce the use of general anaesthetics. Although the General Dental Council says that only a qualified anaesthetist should administer a general anaesthetic, dentists are still permitted by law to do the job themselves. Inquiries after recent deaths have criticised the basic standard of care provided, such as the assessment of the patient's fitness and the monitoring of their heart beat and blood pressure while they are unconscious. There have also been delays in starting resuscitation and getting the patient to hospital when things have gone wrong. In March this year, a dentist and an anaesthetist were charged with manslaughter following the death of five-year-old Karla Selley in Lancashire. The girl, who was having a tooth removed under general anaesthetic, developed breathing difficulties. She was dead on arrival at hospital. Last November, Bradley Legge, also five, died in a dentist's chair in Portsmouth after suffering a heart attack while under general anaesthetic for the removal of two teeth. The most recent paper on the subject in the British Dental Journal a year ago estimated that out of about 70,000 general anaesthetics given in a year, only 7,000 were needed. \"A lot of general anaesthetics are done in general dental practices because the patients want it,\" Mr Wild said. The numbers had already dropped from about 300,000 a year following guidelines discouraging the procedure, issued in 1998 by the General Dental Council. Many patients were happy to opt for sedation or other pain relief instead if the risks involved in general anaesthetics were explained to them. \"I had a practice in the 1960s which gave general anaesthetics. When I looked at the hazards I decided to stop giving general anaesthetics and for the next five years I never had the need to give one,\" Mr Wild said.

A police source who visited the family yesterday said they had reacted in \"disbelief\" to the \u00a310,000 claim. The source said they had been in \"a particularly low mood\". Detectives from Sussex police are also said to be surprised and angered by the timing and circumstances of the claim, which came as the investigation team were being deluged with more than 2,000 calls a day. Paul Langmead, of Roundstone farm in Ferring, near Worthing - which is only 150 metres from Sarah's grand parents' home - put in the claim after officers spent two weeks scouring cornfields around the spot where Sarah was last seen playing with her brothers and sister on July 1. A spokesman for Sussex police said: \"We have asked for clarification of the exact nature of the damage.\" They estimate that about three acres of the farm were affected by their search. In a statement read out on Mr Langmead's behalf at the gate to Roundstone farm, he said he was very upset at the events of the last three weeks and promised any compensation would be donated to a Sarah Payne fund. \"I, and my farm staff, have been deeply distressed by the tragic disappearance and murder of Sarah,\" he said. \"However, we cannot afford to ignore the fact that, through no fault of the police, many thousands of pounds worth of damage have been done to our crops. \"It was entirely proper that the police should have been notified promptly that a quantified claim would be submitted in due course, so that they, or their insurers, could make their own assessment of the damage.\" He added that he felt deep sympathy for the Payne family and hoped that Sarah's murderer would be brought to justice as quickly as possible. \"It goes without saying that I, and my farm staff, will continue to help the police in every possible way during the weeks ahead and any compensation received from Sussex police will be donated to the Sarah Payne Fund,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Depressed regions in England were yesterday promised significantly more cash and greater freedom from Whitehall to create more jobs, redevelop derelict land, and improve run down neighbourhoods. The chancellor and the deputy prime minister told the heads of England's eight new regional development agencies (RDAs) to pursue a more strategic role embracing housing, transport and higher education. Outlining a 10% inflation-plus increase in agency budgets, Gordon Brown and John Prescott promised RDA chairmen that their organisations would shortly be backed by funding drawn from three departments, principally the deputy prime minister's environment, regions and transport empire. Ministers last night stressed that giving the RDAs greater influence - by working with councils, universities, transport operators and housing providers - was as important as the extra cash, which will see budgets rise by \u00a3500m to \u00a31.7 bn in 2003. The move comes two weeks after delegates at Labour's National Policy Forum decided that the next Labour government should commit itself to directly-elected regional government in England \"where there is demand\" - placing the RDAs, effectively business-led quangoes, under democratic control. John Prescott, who is pressing for a firm commitment on English devolution in Labour's next manifesto - notably a white paper, leading to a bill - said yesterday that the RDAs had emerged from the spending review as the \"strategic leaders of economic development and regeneration in the regions\". The deputy prime minister said that extra funds would allow the agencies to \"fire on all cylinders\". With an eye on disaffected voters in Labour's heartlands, Gordon Brown said radical new measures were needed to help poorly performing regions by strengthening economies and promoting social renewal. \"We need to attack the cause of poverty - too few jobs and too little economic activity - and empower local people with the skills and confidence they need to build the enterprising businesses that work.\" Although the share of new money has to be worked out between the eight RDAs, some ministers will be pressing for northern and midlands regions to get the lion's share of the extra cash in recognition of higher unemployment, often three times above the level of the booming south-east. Yesterday's meeting is a further indication that Tony Blair's earlier opposition to special aid for depressed regions has been overtaken by events - namely the party's dismal local election performance in its heartlands two months' ago. Fewer ministers would now trumpet the Prime Minister's claim that disparities within regions - even the booming south-east - are often greater than any north south divide. A subsequent Cabinet Office report supporting this claim is now regarded by some as an embarrassment. A recent government-sponsored report from the centre for advanced studies at Cardiff University accused ministers of concealing the north south gulf for \"political reasons\". It found that while London and the south-east is performing as well as the world's top 10 competitive nations, such as Singapore and Switzerland, regions such as Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-east could be ranked alongside countries like Hungary and Chile. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, acknowledged the north south divide yesterday, promising \u00a350m from his department for a new regional innovation fund.",

Like the Queen Mother, the British like a drink and a flutter on the races. She may have been an appeaser of Hitler, but so were the majority of Britons in 1939 - they had lost relatives and friends in the first world war and didn't want a European civil war.

In my view he was one of the best media manipulators in the business. His election address as the Labour candidate for Moortown was one of the best that bears my imprint as the publisher. Bernard Ingham, for it was he, could teach our col leagues a great deal about the need to \"keep your trap shut\" and \"to put your pen in your pocket\", and \"switch off the word processor\". The real lesson is that old-style Labour agents might well be better to advise politicians than brilliant young journalists are. But at 83 I am not offering my services; I am too busy painting the garden shed. Alderman Sir Richard Knowles Birmingham city council \u0095I felt I had to write to say thank you for your relentless attacks on Tony Blair and New Labour and your daily criticisms of their failures and inadequacies. I write on behalf of my husband and family as well. I must confess that our daily newspaper is the Telegraph, but the Guardian is available at work and for quite a long time now I have been reading it. I am delighted that you have seen through New Labour. Not only that, you have started to praise William Hague and Michael Portillo The day you actually advise your readers to vote for the Conservatives will be the day we start buying the Guardian, as well as the Telegraph.

      "bodyText": "The fate of the world's biggest tall ship, the 122-metre (400ft) Russian four-master Sedov, was in the hands of a French court yesterday, the innocent victim of a 10-year commercial dispute which has developed into a full-scale diplomatic row between the two countries. The court said yesterday that it would rule on Monday whether the French authorities were legally justified in impounding the sail-training vessel at a tall ships regatta in Brest, Brittany, last week. The seizure, at the request of a Swiss trading firm, Noga, which claims it is owed $800m (\u00a3530m) by the Russian government, has made Moscow furious and dealt a blow to Franco-Russian relations, badly strained by Paris's criticism of the Chechen war. The duma, the Russian lower house of parliament, censured Paris this week and called for French property in Russia to be confiscated in retaliation for the \"unfriendly gestures\". As part of the dispute, French courts have frozen the bank accounts of the Russian diplomatic mission in Paris. The Sedov - on a summer tour of European ports with its 176-strong Russian crew of sailors, cadets and schoolboys - was allowed out at the weekend for four days, with two French navy officers on board to ensure that it did not try to escape and under court orders to return to Brest before 9.30am yesterday, in time for the hearing. \"This is the first time in maritime history a school ship has been impounded,\" Michel Quimbert, a lawyer for the ship's owners, the technical university in the northern Russian town of Murmansk, told the court. \"It is not right for children to be taken hostage.\" The mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, has written to the French president, Jacques Chirac, to protest at the treatment of 15 Moscow schoolchildren on the ship. \" They are hostages in a dispute which is none of their making, and their fate is a tragic one,\" he said. Mr Quimbert argued in court that the university could not be held responsible for the dispute, and demanded Fr500,000 and DM600,000 (\u00a3250,000) in compensation. But lawyers for Noga - which wants an immediate payment of $63m as an advance on the money it says it is owed for oil-for-food deals it arranged for Russia in the early 1990s - said the state-run university should be liable for the debts. Twenty of the 100 naval students on board the Sedov attended yesterday's hearing in full uniform, together with the captain, Viktor Mishenev. \"We really do not understand what is going on,\" said Sergei, a cadet. \"We came along for a big party, and all we have found is bitterness and restrictions.\" In recent days the cadets, who were paid just \u00a3125 for their three-month tour of ports in France, Germany, Holland and Madeira, have begun asking the long queues of French visitors to the Sedov for a \u00a32 \"solidarity contribution\". Others have been selling Russian dolls to earn extra cash. The Sedov was built in Germany in 1921 and carried nitrates from Chile and cotton from Australia. It was ceded to Britain as war reparation in 1946 and passed on to the Soviet Union, which renamed it in honour of a leading Russian polar explorer. It passed into the hands of the Murmansk university in 1991.",

      "bodyText": "Vernalis, one of Britain's biotechnology pioneers, yesterday won approval to sell its first product, a pill providing 24-hour relief from migraines. Medical authorities in France gave the green light for the company to launch the drug, called Migard, later this year. This will trigger automatic approval in other European Union countries. Nick Heightman, commercial director of Vernalis, said: \"This is a very important milestone for us. \"It shows that at least one of the start-up companies in the British biopharmaceuticals industry has started to deliver,\" he said. Vernalis's shares jumped 17.5p to 235p on the news. The group joins a select club of small-scale drug development companies that have launched a product - among the others is Celltech, which recently joined the FTSE 100. Analysts believe Migard could snatch 10% of the market for migraine drugs, which is worth about $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) worldwide. However, Vernalis will get about 17% of the revenue; the rest will go to its marketing and development partners. Migard works by constricting the blood vessels in the brain, which dilate to cause severe headaches. Vernalis, formerly Vanguard Medica, says that Migard provides relief for a whole day, in contrast to existing migraine drugs which work for only four to six hours. The approval comes after a difficult period for Vernalis: regulators in the US rejected Migard, asking for more clinical trials. The company recently had unsuccessful merger talks with a rival, CeNeS Pharmaceuticals, and its shares have collapsed from a peak of 697p two years ago. Max Herrmann, an analyst at Charterhouse Securities, said he thought that the City would be likely to remain wary: \"Royalties from this should move them into profits but not until 2004. That's too far out for investors.\"",

      "body": "<p>The Yanks are coming. Next week's Farnborough air show will see a greater presence of US aerospace and defence contractors anxious to secure closer links with European counterparts and governments to undermine the foundations of what they fear will be fortress Europe. </p> <p>Days before the biennial bean feast, Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's under-secretary of defense, said: \"Unfortunately, recent large consolidations in Europe, recent European procurement decisions and recent regional advocacy - regarding industrial mergers - demonstrate a fortress Europe model.\" </p> <p>Well, he would, wouldn't he? The Pentagon encouraged a spate of US mergers in the 1990s only to discover they stifled competition - and the giant companies ran into financial problems. The DoD now wants to open up its domestic market but only a little - and key contracts are off limits for Europeans. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the political masters at the Pentagon and state department are urging the European allies to carry a bigger share of the burden of peace keeping and conflict prevention within their borders. And then squeal like Mr Gansler when they order the Meteor missile for Eurofighter against a Raytheon model or opt for the Airbus A400M military transporter - expect France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Turkey to follow Britain's lead next week and commit to orders - against Boeing's C17 or Lockheed's C130J. </p> <p>The Americans still have to learn that it takes two to tango - in step. As John Weston, BAE Systems chief executive, puts it: \"We need an industrial structure which helps the transatlantic market ... </p> <p>\"There's an industrial dimension to Nato's development.\" BAE, with last week's $1.2bn purchase of Lockheed's electronic warfare business, has a strong US foothold that has helped it move from a aircraft maker to a global systems and software company. </p> <p>Its main European rival, Eads, struggling below its recent float price, wants the Pentagon to give it equal access to the US market, including acquisitions. The Franco-German-Spanish combine is, as CSFB analysts note, overexposed to a likely downturn in the commercial aircraft market and needs to bolster its military business through alliances with US partners - or BAE, despite lingering resentments over its decision to opt for a UK-UK merger (with GEC). None of these conflicts or tensions will be resolved in the bars of Farnborough. For one thing, they need a new White House administration to give the green light for more transatlantic joint ventures, and cross-pond mergers remain a far off vista. </p> <p>They are inherent in a competitive market rendered more opaque by political friendships and rivalries. </p> <p>A resurgent Boeing, for instance, will seek to regain ascendancy over Airbus with a series of orders for its stretched 777s and plans to match Airbus's A3XX superjumbo with bigger 747s. </p> <p>BAE, as Weston admits, cannot yet take on the Americans as prime contractor in their own backyard while the Yanks can and do here. It's up to our US cousins to level the playing-field and allow a few European running-backs on to the pitch. </p> <p><strong> Inequitable life </strong><br> </p> <p> Earlier this year, as the dispute with policyholders over guaranteed annuity rates ground on, Equitable Life, the king of the mutual insurers, went into background briefing mode. The press had entirely misunderstood the court case and its financial implications for the society. The much bandied figure of \u00a31.5bn was a chimera put about by over-excited enemies. The true cost would probably be about \u00a350m, at worst \u00a3200m. Nothing a great society, with \u00a333bn of assets under its care, could not cope with. </p> <p>Letters went out to policyholders in February. \"I am writing to reassure you ... contrary to many of the reports which appeared in the press, there would be no significant costs imposed on the society if the court of appeal's decision were upheld in the House of Lords. Your society remains, and will continue to re main, financially secure.\" The letter was signed by managing director Alan Nash. </p> <p>It is now Equitable's duty to send another letter to policyholders. </p> <p>One can only guess if such hubris will prevail again. What will surprise many policyholders is that the signature at the bottom will again be Mr Nash's. Despite Equitable's calamitous defeat in the House of Lords, he is to remain at the helm and will steer the company into finding a partner \"capable of providing capital support' - read: financial rescue. On the day of the court defeat, and with an ebullience at odds with the unhappy death of the world's oldest mutual society, he said he retained the full support of Equitable's board. </p> <p>Mr Nash is unlikely to have the full support of Equitable's policyholders.

      "bodyText": "The Yanks are coming. Next week's Farnborough air show will see a greater presence of US aerospace and defence contractors anxious to secure closer links with European counterparts and governments to undermine the foundations of what they fear will be fortress Europe. Days before the biennial bean feast, Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's under-secretary of defense, said: \"Unfortunately, recent large consolidations in Europe, recent European procurement decisions and recent regional advocacy - regarding industrial mergers - demonstrate a fortress Europe model.\" Well, he would, wouldn't he? The Pentagon encouraged a spate of US mergers in the 1990s only to discover they stifled competition - and the giant companies ran into financial problems. The DoD now wants to open up its domestic market but only a little - and key contracts are off limits for Europeans. Meanwhile, the political masters at the Pentagon and state department are urging the European allies to carry a bigger share of the burden of peace keeping and conflict prevention within their borders. And then squeal like Mr Gansler when they order the Meteor missile for Eurofighter against a Raytheon model or opt for the Airbus A400M military transporter - expect France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Turkey to follow Britain's lead next week and commit to orders - against Boeing's C17 or Lockheed's C130J. The Americans still have to learn that it takes two to tango - in step. As John Weston, BAE Systems chief executive, puts it: \"We need an industrial structure which helps the transatlantic market ... \"There's an industrial dimension to Nato's development.\" BAE, with last week's $1.2bn purchase of Lockheed's electronic warfare business, has a strong US foothold that has helped it move from a aircraft maker to a global systems and software company. Its main European rival, Eads, struggling below its recent float price, wants the Pentagon to give it equal access to the US market, including acquisitions. The Franco-German-Spanish combine is, as CSFB analysts note, overexposed to a likely downturn in the commercial aircraft market and needs to bolster its military business through alliances with US partners - or BAE, despite lingering resentments over its decision to opt for a UK-UK merger (with GEC). None of these conflicts or tensions will be resolved in the bars of Farnborough. For one thing, they need a new White House administration to give the green light for more transatlantic joint ventures, and cross-pond mergers remain a far off vista. They are inherent in a competitive market rendered more opaque by political friendships and rivalries. A resurgent Boeing, for instance, will seek to regain ascendancy over Airbus with a series of orders for its stretched 777s and plans to match Airbus's A3XX superjumbo with bigger 747s. BAE, as Weston admits, cannot yet take on the Americans as prime contractor in their own backyard while the Yanks can and do here. It's up to our US cousins to level the playing-field and allow a few European running-backs on to the pitch. Inequitable life Earlier this year, as the dispute with policyholders over guaranteed annuity rates ground on, Equitable Life, the king of the mutual insurers, went into background briefing mode. The press had entirely misunderstood the court case and its financial implications for the society. The much bandied figure of \u00a31.5bn was a chimera put about by over-excited enemies. The true cost would probably be about \u00a350m, at worst \u00a3200m. Nothing a great society, with \u00a333bn of assets under its care, could not cope with. Letters went out to policyholders in February. \"I am writing to reassure you ... contrary to many of the reports which appeared in the press, there would be no significant costs imposed on the society if the court of appeal's decision were upheld in the House of Lords. Your society remains, and will continue to re main, financially secure.\" The letter was signed by managing director Alan Nash. It is now Equitable's duty to send another letter to policyholders. One can only guess if such hubris will prevail again. What will surprise many policyholders is that the signature at the bottom will again be Mr Nash's. Despite Equitable's calamitous defeat in the House of Lords, he is to remain at the helm and will steer the company into finding a partner \"capable of providing capital support' - read: financial rescue. On the day of the court defeat, and with an ebullience at odds with the unhappy death of the world's oldest mutual society, he said he retained the full support of Equitable's board. Mr Nash is unlikely to have the full support of Equitable's policyholders. Members will have to vote on a transfer. They should be given the opportunity to put a cross against a motion of no confidence in the board and its directors.",

      "bodyText": "Freddy Bloom, who has died aged 86, was a New Yorker who, after a searing three and a half years in Japanese prison camps during the second world war, made her home in London. The mother of a daughter born profoundly deaf, she subsequently devoted her life to the needs of deaf children. She was born Elfrieden Wenzel, the only child of Robert, a German consular official, and his wife Emmy, a journalist. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University, New York, and took a further degree at Trinity College, Dublin, after her parents moved to Ireland. Her first marriage was to a medical student who became the medical officer to a regiment of the Indian army. When war broke out, her husband was posted to Malaya where, almost immediately, he contracted pleurisy and died. Freddy found a job as a journalist in Shanghai and, while living there, met Philip Bloom, then a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Nine days after they married, Singapore fell, and Freddy and her husband were interned in different Japanese camps. It was an ordeal from which many failed to emerge and in which a few displayed immense heroism.

In fact, the good news about falling car prices in Britain - an average of 1% year on year according to What Car? - hides bad news. </p> <p>The EU Competition Commission has just published a report showing the gap between car prices in Britain and the rest of Europe is growing, and not just because of the strong pound, which should bring down prices for vehicles manufactured on the continent. </p> <p>The EU watchdog cited Volkswagen, Renault, Fiat and Peugeot for overpricing their cars in this country. It found that out of 73 models pre-tax, 65 were more expensive in Britain. </p> <p>UK-built models are also far more costly and this can not be blamed on shipping costs. Named and shamed models include the Vauxhall Astra, the Land-Rover Discovery, the Range Rover and the Honda Civic. </p> <p>The cheapest country in Europe for cars is non-Euroland Denmark. A Fiat Bravo, which costs \u00a310,131 before tax in the UK, is just \u00a34,469 there. </p> <p>But it is the cost of running a car that can really hit a buyer, particularly if you compare this with costs a year ago. Keeping a small car for a year, driving 10,000 miles during that period, costs \u00a31,506 this year, an increase of \u00a3123 on last year. For larger cars the increase is even more dramatic: \u00a32,757 against \u00a32,387, a difference of \u00a3370. </p> <p>Petrol has, controversially, shot up in price. The petrol companies blame the price of crude oil - and to be fair, when oil is cheaper, prices do usually come down - but the bulk of the cost is tax. Petrol costs 86p per litre, 73p of which is VAT and other taxes. </p> <p>So great are the revenues from petrol that ironically, they could scupper the government's economic plans. As headline inflation figures rose to their highest levels in almost two years last month, the statisticians were blaming \"a sharp rise in pump prices\". </p> <p>This time last year petrol was just 70p a litre. Now, according to the AA, the average household spends \u00a370 a week on petrol, making it the single biggest item on the family budget, ahead of food and mortgage payments or rent. </p> <p>Fortunately for most drivers, deputy PM John Prescott has now abandoned plans to introduce motorway tolls, but Londoners may not be so lucky: Mayor Ken Livingstone, pictured left, is still considering plans to charge drivers for bringing their cars into the city centre. </p> <p>Insurance premiums have typically risen 20% on last year and by nearly \u00a3200 over the last six years, while household policies have gone down by \u00a315 in the same period. The AA says drivers can expect their insurance bill to be around \u00a3100 higher this year, with the average premium now \u00a3561. </p> <p>George Lowe, AA director of insurance, says: \"In 1994 insurers were still making a profit. This drew in new players, each one promising to offer lower premiums. What we are seeing now is the backlash of this price war: insurers withdrawing from unprofitable markets, underwriters joining forces to increase their viability in the market and premiums increasing to compensate for years of loss leading.\" </p> <p>Car insurers are now paying out \u00a31.20 in claims and expenses for every \u00a31 they take in premiums, so price rises have been inevitable. One reason is that car accident victims can now claim for more money from insurance companies and \"no win no fee\" solicitors are encouraging more people to claim. </p> <p>Worse still for the industry - and hence the driver - the government has ruled that insurers should reimburse the NHS for money spent on treating victims. </p> <p>The proliferation of internet insurers should push prices down in the future, adds Mr Lowe, but this has yet to take effect. Telephone broker Peoples Choice predicts this will not happen before next year. Car tax has also increased on last year. </p> <p>But there are some ways to cut the cost of car insurance: </p> <p>Shop around. Telephone-based insurance broker Peoples Choice claims it saved one customer nearly \u00a3500 on the back of just one free call to them. </p> <p>Keep your car safe. Many insurers discount for secure parking, alarms and immobilisers. An approved immobiliser can cut premiums by 10%. </p> <p>Protect your no claims bonus. Most car insurance policies allow you to protect your no claims discount, allowing you to make two claims in five years. The benefit of doing this is likely to outweigh the costs. </p> <p>Increase your excess. Most insurers will cut your premium if you agree to a higher excess. Opt for an excess of \u00a3500, and you could, for instance, slash your premium by a quarter. </p> <p>Insure for a named driver. Insurers can more accurately assess the risk for named drivers rather than just any driver, so better rates are offered. If at a later stage a friend or relative needs to drive your car, they can take out temporary cover for a weekend or longer.

      "body": "<p>A guest at Jeffrey Archer's summer party in Grantchester last weekend told me what a sad and desolate affair it has become. The only Tories present were Virginia and Peter Bottomley (I seem to see them at all parties, though for that reason I suppose they could say the same about me), John Gummer, Jonathan Aitken, and the global life president of the World Institute of Thatcherology. </p> <p>There weren't even any photographers stationed outside the gate this year, though any inside could have got a tremendous shot of Thatcher flanked by Aitken and Archer. She, at least, was always able to overlook troubles with the law when they happened to her friends, which appears not to be true of so many other fair-weather liggers and blaggers. </p> <p>Clive James, who lives in Cambridge, was the only celebrity to make the trip, and as for the galaxy of other stars who used to cast their benison on the occasion, none of them turned up at all. \"Almost everyone I spoke to turned out to be one of Jeffrey's neighbours,\" says my party-going mole. </p> <p>\u0095 More fascinating letters about Jack Straw's plainly absurd claim that 31.5% of the male population has been convicted of a serious crime by the age of 30. George Moore, writing from North Yorkshire, blames ignorant civil servants getting their hands on the work of statisticians. \"At some point our boffin pours forth a stream of data from whatever criminal statistics he has been working with. He produces, from a random sample, a table of probability which gives the now famous 31% figure. In the nature of the exercise and common usage, he writes this up, using the term 'population', meaning the statistical population with which he has been working - light years away from 'the population' per se... and so our hero gets to his feet and the rest is, if not history, at least grist to your column.\" </p> <p>Even more significantly, Colin Smith writes from Stourbridge to point out that DJ West and his colleagues at Cambridge have produced many studies of potentially delinquent boys, some of whom they followed from the age of eight. These were all socially disadvantaged, and the dons did some fascinating work on what actually helps a boy from a broken home or a sink estate avoid a life of crime. </p> <p>\"The figure of 30% for criminal records by the age of 30 was the finding for this [especially high at-risk] group. It couldn't be that clever people like Home Office officials and judges have extrapolated this figure from a small and untypical sample to the whole male population? Or could it?\" </p> <p>\u0095 My friend Fergus was in France the other day when he began to feel ill. Things got worse until he found it almost impossible to breathe. A local doctor, who sounds like Charles Bovary only less au fait with the latest medical practice, prescribed some drugs, but when these didn't work, had him whisked immediately into intensive care. (His having the correct EU form means that the French government picks up 80% of the bill; his insurance the rest.) </p> <p>After a few days, they decided he had stabilised, and he's fine now. \"I was barely conscious much of the time in the hospital,\" he said the other day, \"but I realised that I was out of intensive care but still in France when the woman came round to my bed with lunch. ' Du vin, monsieur ?' she asked.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Thanks, too, for all your gastronomic news from Wigan, the P\u00e9rigord of the North. Several readers have written in about the Wigan kebab, which is three pies on a stick, and Ian Foster claims to correct me over the \"Wigan butty\". \"This is actually called a 'slap barm', he says, \"from the noise the pie makes hitting the buttered barm cake.\" I shall leave local etymologists to sort this out. </p> <p>Mike Southcott of Preston has sent a clipping from his local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post. It shows the nuptial festivities of Jonathan and Jane Farrimond of Standish, near Wigan, who are glimpsed in front of three tiers of pie-shaped wedding cakes. The groom's mother said that they looked exactly like three meat and potato pies. \"We were shocked, but it is typical of them,\" she added. </p> <p>We had hoped to bring you this picture, but it has been suggested the rights are being sold for some absurd sum, as if it showed Elvis in Loch Ness, or Prince William snogging Britney Spears. Or perhaps, I would hope, so that the couple's children never have to see the grisly evidence. </p> <p> \u0095 Watching Boss Women on BBC1, the film about the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour, it struck me once more that fashion writers are probably the only journalists left who feel it essential to suck up shamelessly to the people they are writing about. The days of lickspittle motoring correspondents (\"there are plenty of gee-gees under this bonnet, and they're all British... if I have a complaint, it is that the ash tray is a little small\") are long gone. Sports reporters frequently say the rudest things and make the most damaging allegations against club managements. Even some theatre critics have come to realise that their job is not merely to act as boosters for British actors and playwrights. </p> <p>Yet fashion slavishly reports each bizarre and absurd garment, every upside-down dress, every hat disguised as a dead partridge, as if it were an artistic achievement. Meanwhile, these preening idiots measure their own self-esteem by the seat they are allocated for each catwalk cavalcade.

      "bodyText": "A guest at Jeffrey Archer's summer party in Grantchester last weekend told me what a sad and desolate affair it has become. The only Tories present were Virginia and Peter Bottomley (I seem to see them at all parties, though for that reason I suppose they could say the same about me), John Gummer, Jonathan Aitken, and the global life president of the World Institute of Thatcherology. There weren't even any photographers stationed outside the gate this year, though any inside could have got a tremendous shot of Thatcher flanked by Aitken and Archer. She, at least, was always able to overlook troubles with the law when they happened to her friends, which appears not to be true of so many other fair-weather liggers and blaggers. Clive James, who lives in Cambridge, was the only celebrity to make the trip, and as for the galaxy of other stars who used to cast their benison on the occasion, none of them turned up at all. \"Almost everyone I spoke to turned out to be one of Jeffrey's neighbours,\" says my party-going mole. \u0095 More fascinating letters about Jack Straw's plainly absurd claim that 31.5% of the male population has been convicted of a serious crime by the age of 30. George Moore, writing from North Yorkshire, blames ignorant civil servants getting their hands on the work of statisticians. \"At some point our boffin pours forth a stream of data from whatever criminal statistics he has been working with. He produces, from a random sample, a table of probability which gives the now famous 31% figure. In the nature of the exercise and common usage, he writes this up, using the term 'population', meaning the statistical population with which he has been working - light years away from 'the population' per se... and so our hero gets to his feet and the rest is, if not history, at least grist to your column.\" Even more significantly, Colin Smith writes from Stourbridge to point out that DJ West and his colleagues at Cambridge have produced many studies of potentially delinquent boys, some of whom they followed from the age of eight. These were all socially disadvantaged, and the dons did some fascinating work on what actually helps a boy from a broken home or a sink estate avoid a life of crime. \"The figure of 30% for criminal records by the age of 30 was the finding for this [especially high at-risk] group. It couldn't be that clever people like Home Office officials and judges have extrapolated this figure from a small and untypical sample to the whole male population? Or could it?\" \u0095 My friend Fergus was in France the other day when he began to feel ill. Things got worse until he found it almost impossible to breathe. A local doctor, who sounds like Charles Bovary only less au fait with the latest medical practice, prescribed some drugs, but when these didn't work, had him whisked immediately into intensive care. (His having the correct EU form means that the French government picks up 80% of the bill; his insurance the rest.) After a few days, they decided he had stabilised, and he's fine now. \"I was barely conscious much of the time in the hospital,\" he said the other day, \"but I realised that I was out of intensive care but still in France when the woman came round to my bed with lunch. ' Du vin, monsieur ?' she asked.\" \u0095 Thanks, too, for all your gastronomic news from Wigan, the P\u00e9rigord of the North. Several readers have written in about the Wigan kebab, which is three pies on a stick, and Ian Foster claims to correct me over the \"Wigan butty\". \"This is actually called a 'slap barm', he says, \"from the noise the pie makes hitting the buttered barm cake.\" I shall leave local etymologists to sort this out. Mike Southcott of Preston has sent a clipping from his local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post. It shows the nuptial festivities of Jonathan and Jane Farrimond of Standish, near Wigan, who are glimpsed in front of three tiers of pie-shaped wedding cakes. The groom's mother said that they looked exactly like three meat and potato pies. \"We were shocked, but it is typical of them,\" she added. We had hoped to bring you this picture, but it has been suggested the rights are being sold for some absurd sum, as if it showed Elvis in Loch Ness, or Prince William snogging Britney Spears. Or perhaps, I would hope, so that the couple's children never have to see the grisly evidence. \u0095 Watching Boss Women on BBC1, the film about the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour, it struck me once more that fashion writers are probably the only journalists left who feel it essential to suck up shamelessly to the people they are writing about. The days of lickspittle motoring correspondents (\"there are plenty of gee-gees under this bonnet, and they're all British... if I have a complaint, it is that the ash tray is a little small\") are long gone. Sports reporters frequently say the rudest things and make the most damaging allegations against club managements. Even some theatre critics have come to realise that their job is not merely to act as boosters for British actors and playwrights. Yet fashion slavishly reports each bizarre and absurd garment, every upside-down dress, every hat disguised as a dead partridge, as if it were an artistic achievement. Meanwhile, these preening idiots measure their own self-esteem by the seat they are allocated for each catwalk cavalcade. If lobby correspondents in last weekend's film about Alastair Campbell had minced into Downing Street, saying \"Do you mind? I think you'll find that's my seat directly in front of Alastair!\" we'd never have heard the end of it. Yet the fashion press goes on spending millions of pounds and aeons of time uncritically promoting the industry.",

His utterly sensible rationale was: \"All my friends are here.\" </p> <p>Besides, why risk opening an untested show on Broadway - with costs sometimes double those of the West End - where a show can be gone within months? London clearly remains the safer option, not least because the imprimateur of West End success then acts as a show's best advocate for a transfer to New York. </p> <p>Nonetheless, with Witches at last upon us, I can't help feeling \"good show/wrong city\", more or less borne out by this week's mixed critical response. If ever a putative London blockbuster seemed ripe for New York - in terms of subject matter, sentiment and score - Witches is it. As an American based in London for many years, here's my advice to this newborn musical: go west, young show. </p> <p>Why? Begin with the music by relative American unknowns John Dempsey and Dana P Rowe. They fared distinctly poorly with the London press in their previous outing, a Mackintosh-backed run of The Fix, directed by Sam Mendes at the Donmar Warehouse in 1997. Paradoxically, Mackintosh has acknowledged that the dismissive response to The Fix moved him to give the songwriters another chance with Witches. \"The fact is,\" says the producer, \"a lot of the British critics don't have an ear.\" Nor can Londoners necessarily be expected to appreciate an appealingly eclectic score steeped in the Broadway era of Bells Are Ringing and Bye Bye Birdie of some 40 or more years ago. </p> <p>While too many contemporary composers are writing in a genre that one might best describe as post-Sondheimian drear, Dempsey and Rowe pay homage to an unabashedly jazzy, brassy Broadway of yore: torch songs and anthems, wistful ballads and all-out oompah company numbers. This score's totemic figures would seem to be Frank Loesser, Jerry Herman and Cy Coleman, not the heavily orchestrated faux-operatics of the Lloyd Webber or Alain Boublil/Claude-Michel Schonberg school - the team behind Miss Saigon and Les Mis\u00e9rables - on whom Mackintosh made his millions. </p> <p>The result, in musical terms, places Witches in opposition to the bulk of West End fare, which tends towards either ponderous Puccini-isms or Abba Euro-pop. (The exception: Maria Friedman's first-act showstopper, Words, Words, Words, which owes a delightfully self-evident debt to the patter songs of Gilbert and Sullivan.) If such a decisively American sound deserves an American hearing, one goes on to question the suitability for the British of the musical's very attitude and tone. </p> <p>Compare, for starters, some of the other heroines concurrently on offer in the West End - Blood Brothers' hapless Mrs Johnston, for instance, with her doomy fixation on Marilyn Monroe; or the fall-and-rise-and-back-again trajectory of Spend Spend Spend's Viv Nicholson, a tough little lady whom life has clearly not spared. </p> <p>Against these self-evident English victims, what could seem bolder and more brash than not one American woman but three who learn to live without men and, in the process, love themselves? \"I am the music,\" sings cellist Joanna Riding in the show's exultant final number, Look At Me, with sculptress Lucie Arnaz adding for good measure: \"I am a major work of art.\" Frustrated journalist Maria Friedman, meanwhile, discovers that her much-needed words were \"inside me all along\". </p> <p>Before long, the trio have launched into exactly the kind of roof-raising hymn to selfhood on which thrives the Broadway musical as an extension of the American psyche. (The deliciously cynical Chicago sends up this very notion in a lyric like: \"I am my own best friend.\") \"How corny,\" remarked an English friend, reacting to sentiments that across the Atlantic have assumed the status of gospel.

Radio 3 listeners will have missed the fascinating contrast in style between Erskine's wonderfully controlled and laid-back authority and Glennie's attention-seeking flamboyance. A glimpse of the score showed that in the cadenzas the two of them are allowed quite a lot of improvisational freedom (Erskine especially), but most of the piece is precisely notated, though some of Glennie's contributions suggested that either changes had been made during rehearsal or she was taking further liberties with what she had been allotted. Doubtless the piece will settle down as it receives further performances; a first encounter suggests that Turnage's music has continued to expand its range and its flexibility, and that he has written a work that confounds expectations of what a double percussion concerto might be, as much as it confirms them. </p> <p>\u0095 The premiere is on BBC1 on August 13.</p>",

Radio 3 listeners will have missed the fascinating contrast in style between Erskine's wonderfully controlled and laid-back authority and Glennie's attention-seeking flamboyance. A glimpse of the score showed that in the cadenzas the two of them are allowed quite a lot of improvisational freedom (Erskine especially), but most of the piece is precisely notated, though some of Glennie's contributions suggested that either changes had been made during rehearsal or she was taking further liberties with what she had been allotted. Doubtless the piece will settle down as it receives further performances; a first encounter suggests that Turnage's music has continued to expand its range and its flexibility, and that he has written a work that confounds expectations of what a double percussion concerto might be, as much as it confirms them. \u0095 The premiere is on BBC1 on August 13.",

During Feel My Frankenstein, Cooper roams the stage finding bloody bits of bodies and feeding them into an upright glass pod, straight out of 60s sci-fi cinema. He is all of 20th-century humanity, embodying the tragic hubris of man the technologist. </p> <p>The ethics of mercy-killing get a look in too, as Cooper sings Goodbye Little Baby while spearing a two-headed infant on his sabre. For this crime, he is bloodily guillotined. Cooper always has to die for our sins. Halfway through the show, we endure a fabulously, insanely dull drum solo, which really does seem to last the biblical three days and nights. And then, naturally, Cooper is resurrected: reanimated from within his Frankenstein pod, resplendent in white tails over a shredded chain mail T-shirt. No More Mr Nice Guy. </p> <p>Cooper is the Nietzschean Antichrist of rock: a man beyond shame, beyond useless humility, who glories in his dirty power. \"I am a vicious young man,\" he sneers. Age cannot wither him: the arch wielding of a crutch during I'm Eighteen is mere cunning misdirection. And how his fans love to be abused by this avuncular Beelzebub. \"Raise your hands if you're poison!\" he commands, and we all do. \"Oh, my disobedient children!\" he wails, spying a headbanger in a Marilyn Manson T-shirt. The disappointment is righteous: Manson stole Cooper's phantasmagoria but stripped it of all its humour and joie de mourir . </p> <p>Meanwhile, through it all, Cooper's band pounds out an irresistibly raw, multi-legged spider of hard rock: the twin guitars build churches of harmonic crunch. His greatest hits are all present and freshly forged in Hell's finest rehearsal room: Under My Wheels, Poison, Go to Hell, Billion Dollar Baby, I Wanna Be Elected, and of course the anthem of anthems, School's Out. </p> <p>Cooper has also been having his traditional woman problems. A masked, writhing S&amp;M dancer gets kicked off her podium; a Carry On nurse is repeatedly shoved into the boot of a wrecked car. But then Cooper gets sensitive, sitting on a stool to sing his feminist ballad, Only Women Bleed. A grinning apologist explained to me that Cooper had gone further than any other male pop artist in dealing with women's issues. \"Even Lloyd Cole didn't write a song about menstruation,\" he shouted through the din, nearly convincingly. </p> <p>But Alice's best feminist joke comes when he reappears for the encore in a black sleeveless T-shirt with the legend: \"Britney Wants Me.\" He gyrates his hips and then twirls, so we can read the continuation on his back: \"Dead.\" There can be few better recommendations.</p>",

In many African societies people are Muslim, Christian and animist, taking from each belief system what they gauge is the best for themselves. </p> <p>There are, too, perfectly workable local trading systems in which members of a community or interest group exchange goods among themselves using their own local currencies. This allows them to cut out middlemen and avoid debt, and gives them some control of their own system of exchange. The New Economics Foundation recently proposed a local currency for London. We could have the euro, the pound and the \"London\" all running in parallel, each useful for different exchanges. </p> <p>Tesco is so far happy with its experiment, as are the customers - and not just people who grew up before metrification.

There are, too, perfectly workable local trading systems in which members of a community or interest group exchange goods among themselves using their own local currencies. This allows them to cut out middlemen and avoid debt, and gives them some control of their own system of exchange. The New Economics Foundation recently proposed a local currency for London. We could have the euro, the pound and the \"London\" all running in parallel, each useful for different exchanges. Tesco is so far happy with its experiment, as are the customers - and not just people who grew up before metrification. Any government, whether local, national or international, should learn the lessons of history. People change slowly. They like choice. And to force a rigid system on anyone usually proves hazardous.",

She is currently starring as Esmeralda in Notre-Dame de Paris at the Dominion Theatre, London. What is your idea of perfect happiness? At this point in time, a new personality. What is your greatest fear? Being unable to find that new personality. With which historical figure do you most identify? Joan of Arc - I may not burn for my beliefs, but I've certainly sacrificed. Which living person do you most admire? Goldie Hawn - I wish I had her sense of humour right now. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Let's not start. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Sleazy come-ons. What objects do you always carry with you? Everything but the kitchen sink. What is your favourite building? Hard to say: there are so many to choose from. I'm a big fan of architecture. What is your favourite journey? The one I'm on - life. Should the Royal Family be scrapped? Not for me to comment. Do you believe in capital punishment? Far too broad a question - we could debate this issue for years - and I'm not running for government. For what cause would you die? Oh please - not a relevant question in the 21st century. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes, with the right person. What or who is the greatest love of your life? My pet pooch Goldie. Which living person do you most despise and why? The trick is to never let them know! What is your greatest regret? My first marriage. How do you relax? What's that? How often do you have sex? You guys have got to get a life! What single thing would improve the quality of your life? More personal time. How would you like to die? Painlessly, of course. How would you like to be remembered? As making a contribution to friends and family. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Be real.",

      "body": "<p>If you've been feeling mildly bitter about the state of the brewing industry, perk yourself up with a trip to the annual Great British Beer Festival at London Olympia, where you'll be refreshed by the sight of hundreds of cask ales from the country's family-owned regional and smaller craft breweries.</p> <p>Bass and Whitbread may have thrown in the bar towel and sold their breweries to Interbrew of Belgium, manufacturer of a billion gaseous glasses of Stella Artois; and such revered names as Mansfield, Marston's, Morland and Ruddles may have been swallowed by regional giants Greene King and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley - but British beer is still alive and bubbling. In fact, I cannot recall a time when so many new ales have come into the nation's bars, all of them ales that have been crafted with great skill and dedication. As well as rich-tasting bitters, porters, summer ales and harvest beers, brewers have kicked aside convention and searched for new aromas and flavours: St Peter's beer, for example, made with lemongrass and ginger, and St Austell's Clouded Yellow, made with the addition of vanilla and maple syrup. And what about the hoppy delights of Yella Belly, Bateman's welcome contribution to the growing ranks of organic beers?</p> <p>Yes, there will be such delights, and no doubt surprises aplenty, at the Great British Beer Festival, which is being staged by the indefatigable Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) from August 1-5. Some 700 beers will be on show, including some genuine lagers , both dark and pale, from the Czech Republic, Germany and the US, but the belt and braces of this annual beer bonanza will, as ever, be the cask-conditioned ales brewed by those British brewers who are still wedded to such concepts as flavour and character.</p> <p>Unlike Bass and Whitbread, who first sold their souls to bland lager and \"creamflow\" keg beers and then sold their birthright to Interbrew, our smaller brewers have kept the faith, and still make distinctive ales that ripen in casks in pub cellars. They don't see themselves as part of an industry in crisis, with real ale disappearing into the abyss. London's two independents, Fuller's and Young's, report a healthy rise in the sales of their beers, as do Brakspear of Henley, Charles Wells of Bedford, and Belhaven in Scotland; Timothy Taylor, meanwhile, whose aromatically hopped Landlord pale ale won the Champion Beer of Britain award at last year's festival, brewed more beer last year than at any time in a history that dates back to 1858, and has just installed new fermenters to cope with demand. And just this month, the Tomos Watkin brewery moved from its cramped premises behind a pub in Llandeilo to smart new buildings in Swansea, from where it can boost dramatically the output of its ripe and succulent ales. There are similar good stories from all over the country.</p> <p>More than just a forum for our best brews, however, the festival destroys all the clich\u00e9s about real ale. It's not peopled solely by men with vast girths and bird's-nest beards: 40% of visitors are women, and many ale drinkers, of both sexes, are young. There will be ales, lagers, ciders and perries to suit all tastes and age groups, and the music at lunchtime and evening will cater for rockers and classicists alike. Royalists can sup at a special bar with beers brewed to mark the Queen Mother's 100th birthday, while republicans can raise a glass of Tom Paine at the Harvey of Lewes stand.</p> <p>The festival kicks off with the annual Champion Beer of Britain competition to find the finest milds, bitters, strong bitters and speciality beers.

      "bodyText": "If you've been feeling mildly bitter about the state of the brewing industry, perk yourself up with a trip to the annual Great British Beer Festival at London Olympia, where you'll be refreshed by the sight of hundreds of cask ales from the country's family-owned regional and smaller craft breweries. Bass and Whitbread may have thrown in the bar towel and sold their breweries to Interbrew of Belgium, manufacturer of a billion gaseous glasses of Stella Artois; and such revered names as Mansfield, Marston's, Morland and Ruddles may have been swallowed by regional giants Greene King and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley - but British beer is still alive and bubbling. In fact, I cannot recall a time when so many new ales have come into the nation's bars, all of them ales that have been crafted with great skill and dedication. As well as rich-tasting bitters, porters, summer ales and harvest beers, brewers have kicked aside convention and searched for new aromas and flavours: St Peter's beer, for example, made with lemongrass and ginger, and St Austell's Clouded Yellow, made with the addition of vanilla and maple syrup. And what about the hoppy delights of Yella Belly, Bateman's welcome contribution to the growing ranks of organic beers? Yes, there will be such delights, and no doubt surprises aplenty, at the Great British Beer Festival, which is being staged by the indefatigable Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) from August 1-5. Some 700 beers will be on show, including some genuine lagers , both dark and pale, from the Czech Republic, Germany and the US, but the belt and braces of this annual beer bonanza will, as ever, be the cask-conditioned ales brewed by those British brewers who are still wedded to such concepts as flavour and character. Unlike Bass and Whitbread, who first sold their souls to bland lager and \"creamflow\" keg beers and then sold their birthright to Interbrew, our smaller brewers have kept the faith, and still make distinctive ales that ripen in casks in pub cellars. They don't see themselves as part of an industry in crisis, with real ale disappearing into the abyss. London's two independents, Fuller's and Young's, report a healthy rise in the sales of their beers, as do Brakspear of Henley, Charles Wells of Bedford, and Belhaven in Scotland; Timothy Taylor, meanwhile, whose aromatically hopped Landlord pale ale won the Champion Beer of Britain award at last year's festival, brewed more beer last year than at any time in a history that dates back to 1858, and has just installed new fermenters to cope with demand. And just this month, the Tomos Watkin brewery moved from its cramped premises behind a pub in Llandeilo to smart new buildings in Swansea, from where it can boost dramatically the output of its ripe and succulent ales. There are similar good stories from all over the country. More than just a forum for our best brews, however, the festival destroys all the clich\u00e9s about real ale. It's not peopled solely by men with vast girths and bird's-nest beards: 40% of visitors are women, and many ale drinkers, of both sexes, are young. There will be ales, lagers, ciders and perries to suit all tastes and age groups, and the music at lunchtime and evening will cater for rockers and classicists alike. Royalists can sup at a special bar with beers brewed to mark the Queen Mother's 100th birthday, while republicans can raise a glass of Tom Paine at the Harvey of Lewes stand. The festival kicks off with the annual Champion Beer of Britain competition to find the finest milds, bitters, strong bitters and speciality beers. Once again, the Guardian has joined forces with Camra in sponsoring the bottle-conditioned beer awards, and we need volunteer readers to join the panel of judges. The tasting is at 12 noon on July 31, at Olympia. Volunteers should write to Matthew Fort, Food &amp; Drink Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER with a day-time telephone number (or email: weekend@ theguardian.com). \u0095 Full details of the festival on www.gbbf.org.",

The non-vintage, own-label South African Cabernet Sauvignon (15.5 points, on offer at \u00a33.49) is utterly unpretentious and deliciously mellow. It makes few demands on the intellect, true, but as a slab of fruit it is marvellously quaffable. Winds Of Change Pinotage Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16 points, on offer at \u00a33.99) has elegance, dryness and a savoury biscuit quality to its texture. It throws in a quietly thrilling climax of spicy plums and berries. </p> <p>Last at Sainsbury, there is La Chasse du Pape 'Reserve Barrique' C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99). This is not a 'special offer' price, but it could advertise itself as such for it is a marvellous bargain offering stunning ripeness, earthy plum fruit with undertones of blackcurrants, and lively tannins. The same wine is also at Safeway, but it is the 1999 vintage and this rates the same and costs the same and just about tastes the same, except that, being that bit older and from a different vintage, there is more weight on the tannins but it is still a marvellously solid, textured wine of great class and sensory impact. </p> <p>Safeway has three further worthy reds. Mont Tauch Barrel-Matured Merlot Vin de Pays du Torgan 1998 (17 points, \u00a37.99) is magnificent, and available at selected branches. It has superb tobacco undertones to the leather, and plummy spiciness; my tasting notes, only a trifle extravagantly, include the rider 'Is this the P\u00e9trus of the Midi?' This refers to an obscene Bordeaux artefact, employing the same grape, that asks a hundred times more money. The extraordinary complexity and beautifully textured richness of the Mont Tauch represent far better value. </p> <p>Cono Sur Reserva Merlot 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a36.49), from Chile, also puts to shame many a stratospherically higher-priced Bordeaux. It is not chilly or austere, but warm, friendly, rounded and a huge, fun-filled, quaffing wine. Likewise Domaine Chris Limouzi Corbi\u00e8res 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.49), which has exceptionally soft and beautifully textured tobacco and blackberry fruit.

If the sun shines she'll be baked, if it rains she'll be drowned, she'll be robbed or raped, or at the very least have to queue for an E. coli-infested loo.</p> <p>But these are remote anxieties.

It's marvellous. You really should get to grips with it. There's lots about Scotland on it, you know.\"</p> <p>\"Mum!\" Harriet arrives, fresh from phone. \"Emma can't come! She can't afford it! And Gabby's parents are taking her on holiday then! But Tris 'n' Wills are still okay, and Wills says he's got a tent like big enough for all of us.\" Wait! He? Realise belatedly that Wills, and probably also Tris, possesses testicles. \"I'm not sure if a girl as young as you...\"</p> <p>\"It's todally, like, safe, Mum!

      "bodyText": "'Dulcie? Arrre you thinking of going on holiday this summerrr, dearrr ?\" Aunt wants trip to Scotland. Has been dropping subtle hints for weeks about the Highlands and how she longs to see a man in a kilt once more before she dies. Kilts evidently Caledonian form of HRT. \"I'm thinking of Umbria, Auntie,\" I retort firmly. \"But Gordon might fancy a little trip north. I want to show Harriet some Renaissance art before she starts going off on holidays with her friends.\" Harriet already wants to go off with her friends - to the Reading Festival. Can Perugino's frescoes compete with the Foo Fighters? Surely she is too young to go to a pop festival? \"Don't worry, Mum. Emma's going, an' Gabby an' Shelley 'n' Tris 'n' Wills.\" Am fleetingly reassured, though know my misgivings will loom up again later. My baby! If the sun shines she'll be baked, if it rains she'll be drowned, she'll be robbed or raped, or at the very least have to queue for an E. coli-infested loo. But these are remote anxieties. A more immediate concern is what we are going to have for supper. The treadmill of catering. But wait! I have discovered the possibility of on-line shopping. Run to computer and introduce myself to Iceland and Waitrose. Torn between Iceland's offer, Belchers 800g Bar-B-Q Rib 'n' Wing Combo, and Waitrose's Blackened Pastrami Salmon With Rocket And Grilled Lemon, though the latter sounds more like a defence policy than a tempting delicacy. Aunt looms up behind me. \"Iceland!\" she exclaims. \"I thought you said you werrre thinking of Umbrrria, dearrr ?\" \"I am, Auntie,\" I hurl my cursor towards Go airlines and summon up prices of flights to Rome. \"You can do anything on the internet these days. It's marvellous. You really should get to grips with it. There's lots about Scotland on it, you know.\" \"Mum!\" Harriet arrives, fresh from phone. \"Emma can't come! She can't afford it! And Gabby's parents are taking her on holiday then! But Tris 'n' Wills are still okay, and Wills says he's got a tent like big enough for all of us.\" Wait! He? Realise belatedly that Wills, and probably also Tris, possesses testicles. \"I'm not sure if a girl as young as you...\" \"It's todally, like, safe, Mum! There's loads of police and first aid and everything. Log on to the Reading Festival website - you'll see.\" Obey, though uneasily aware of Aunt still hovering. Reading website opens with artwork of young couple sprawling in underwear. Young man invites me, through speech bubble, to \"Click on my pants to enter the site\".

      "body": "<p>It's a wet Wednesday lunchtime when Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, arrives at Anna Waddell's family home in Holloway, north London. The plan is - or at least it was until the heavens opened - to help 18-year-old Anna prepare a farewell picnic for her brothers, sisters and their respective broods.</p> <p>Anna is unfazed by the dreadful July weather, perhaps because she'll soon be well out of it: before starting university in the autumn, the jammy so-and-so is off with Raleigh International to Belize for three months, where one of her responsibilities - other than working on the tan, of course - will be to monitor fer de lance snakes (big fangs, very poisonous: on second thoughts, let's strike that \"jammy\" part). Anyway, the intrepid explorer is leaving in three days, and isn't remotely organised, let alone packed. Which is where the Kitchen Doctor comes in: would she mind \"helping out a bit\", Anna had wondered.</p> <p>To begin with, Anna's notion of \"a bit\" is more your average person's idea of \"a lot\", as she keeps disappearing to answer phone calls from friends wanting to catch up. Rosie doesn't seem to mind, however; she just unpacks her knives and instructs Practical Polly, her assistant for the day, to make the pesto, roast the peppers and bake the muffins. The sound of chopping and whirring entices Anna away from the phone, and Rosie promptly sits her down for a lesson on the ins and outs of making chocolate meringue for the Picnic Mess.</p> <p>\"Why's it called a mess?\" asks Anna, as you would.</p> <p>\"Because that's just what it is,\" Rosie replies. \"A big mess of lots of yummy stuff all mixed up together.\" Anna looks unconvinced. \"Wait till you try it,\" says Rosie, and pops the meringues into the oven.</p> <p>Next, it's on to the chicken roll-ups. \"Have you got a whacky thing, that I can use to flatten the chicken breasts?\" asks the KD.</p> <p>\"A whacky thing?\" repeats Anna, being unfamiliar with highfalutin culinary terminology.</p> <p>\"Never mind, I'll use this frying pan instead,\" says Rosie, then beats seven bells out of the chicken pieces until they are so flat that they look as if a juggernaut has run over them. Then she shows Anna how to construct the rolls, spreading them with Polly's pesto and strips of roasted pepper, before rolling the whole lot up in cling-film. \"Oh dear, I haven't done that right,\" Rosie says of her initial attempt. \"You're meant to be able to tie the ends together.\"</p> <p>\"What, like this?\" says Anna, whose own trial run has been altogether more successful.</p> <p>\"Er, yes . . . how did you manage to do that?\" Rather chastened, Rosie stands up and sticks her head into the oven. Only to check on the meringues, mind. \"Oh dear, how did that happen?\" she mutters. \"They're more not-very-risen-at-all-really brown blobs than meringues.\"</p> <p>\"It's a bit temperamental, heat-wise,\" explains Anna, at which Rosie shoves her bare arm into the depths of the oven: \"I see what you mean,\" she declares as everyone else winces, \"but it'll have to do.\"</p> <p>The KD then points at the packets of fresh herbs lined up waiting to go into the herby cheese filling for the muffins and the marinade for the Greek salad on a stick (devised, she says, because she adores cheesy snacks - \"Cheesy as in tacky, not dairy\"). Anna obediently sets to, tackling first the mint, then the parsley, then the dill and chives, before lifting up the final bunch of feathery leaves: \"What's this?\"</p> <p>\"Chervil,\" mumbles Rosie, her attention diverted by the task of pastry-rolling.</p> <p>\"Gerbil!?\" says Anna, just a touch alarmed.</p> <p>\"No: cher-vil,\" says Rosie, enunciating this time, but beginning to look flustered. The rain clouds have put paid to the picnic on Hampstead Heath, and she's got to have everything ready within the hour, so they can drive it round to Anna's brother David's house. She spreads half the pastry on an enamel plate, scatters over some chopped bacon, breaks the eggs on top and pops on a pastry lid: \"My mum always made this for picnics. It's my absolute favourite - she'd always cook it on enamel, then wrap it up in old newspaper, and it would stay warm for ages. Have you got a pastry brush, by the way?\"</p> <p>\"A what?\" says Anna, still not up to speed on her culinary expressions.</p> <p>\"To glaze the pastry with,\" explains Rosie.</p> <p>\"Don't think so,\" says Anna. \"But I've got a paintbrush. And an old make-up brush. Shall I go and get it?</p> <p>\"I think not,\" advises Rosie sagely.</p> <p>Half an hour later, the pies are ready, and there's a mad rush to pack everything up and into the car, before speeding off to David's, where assorted siblings, nephews and nieces have assembled. The rain has abated for now, and after a hasty family meeting it is decided to risk the back garden - they're a fearless lot, these Waddells. A blanket is laid out on the lawn, Rosie unpacks the spread, the Waddell hordes take one look and then dive in with \"oooohs\" and \"aaaaahs\" aplenty. Rosie allows herself a quiet smile as she leaves them to it, another job well done.</p> <p>All recipes serve four.</p> <p><b> Greek salad on a stick</b></p> <p><b>24 cherry tomatoes</b></p> <p><b>cucumber, cut down the middle lengthwise, seeds removed</b></p> <p><b>1-2 large red onions, peeled</b></p> <p><b>225g feta, cut into cubes</b></p> <p><b>55g pitted black olives</b></p> <p><b>1 large handful mint, roughly chopped</b></p> <p><b>1 smal handful flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</b></p> <p><b>12 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</b></p> <p><b>5 tbsp lemon juice</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>12 wooden skewers</b></p> <p>Mix together the oil, lemon juice, seasoning and herbs (test the feta for saltiness first). Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons and the onions into eighths.</p> <p>An hour before your picnic outing is to commence, throw everything into a big bowl and leave to marinade, turning from time to time. Ten minutes before departure, thread alternate bits on to the skewers including at least two of everything, and cut off the skewers' pointy ends with scissors.</p> <p><b> Bacon-and-egg pie</b></p> <p>This is best made on a 26cm enamel plate, but a shallow cake tin of the same size will be fine.</p> <p><b> 250g puff pastry</b></p> <p><b>4 rashers smoked back bacon, chopped up</b></p> <p><b>4 eggs</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>Milk, for glazing</b></p> <p><b>1 small knob butter, for greasing</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Roll the pastry into two thin circles. Use one to line the greased plate/tin, sprinkle the bacon over the base, break the eggs evenly around and just prick the yolks so they run slightly. Season and then carefully lay on the other pastry round, brushing a little milk around the join to ensure the lid seals properly. Cut a cross in the centre of the lid, brush with a little milk and bake for about 35 minutes, until the top is golden and the pie has puffed up. Leave the pie to cool slightly, then wrap in a cloth followed by about five layers of newspaper tied with string.</p> <p><b> Chicken roll-ups</b></p> <p><b>4 boneless chicken breasts</b></p> <p><b>3 medium-sized red peppers</b></p> <p><b>2 large handfuls fresh basil</b></p> <p><b>25g pinenuts</b></p> <p><b>1 clove garlic</b></p> <p><b>55g Parmesan, grated</b></p> <p><b>75ml olive oil</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>1 packet soft tortillas</b></p> <p><b>Large handful rocket</b></p> <p>Roast the peppers in a hot oven until charred (alternatively, grill them over a flame), then put in a bowl while still hot and cover tightly with cling-film. When they are cool enough to handle, peel and deseed the peppers, cut them into strips, season and put to one side.</p> <p>Next, make the pesto: place the basil, pinenuts, garlic and seasoning in a food processor, along with two tablespoons of the olive oil, whizz to a pur\u00e9e, then gradually pour in the rest of the oil. Stir in the cheese, and set aside.</p> <p>Place a chicken breast between two sheets of cling-film and bash it flat with a rolling pin. Repeat with the other breasts. Remove the top layer of film, and spread the chicken with pesto, the red pepper strips and seasoning. Then, using the remaining piece of clingfilm to help you, roll it up like a sort of Swiss roll. Twist the ends of the cling-film, and tie together, so you have a neat, firm roll. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes. Fill a large pan with cold water and bring to the boil, season the water then poach the chicken roll-ups in their cling-film casings for about 15 minutes until just cooked through. Leave them to cool, then remove their cling-film wrappings.</p> <p>If you have any roasted peppers left, whizz them up with any left-over pesto. Spread the flat breads with the pepper pesto, put the rocket on top, then pop in the chicken, fold in the ends of the tortilla and roll them up. Wrap in paper and twist the ends, so that it looks like a cracker, then cut in half on a slight diagonal.</p> <p><b> Herb-cheese 'muffins'</b></p> <p>These are really more a savoury madeleine stuffed with a herb cheese that is often served as part of the cheese course in south-west France.</p> <p><b> 65g flour</b></p> <p><b>50g polenta</b></p> <p><b>30g cornflour</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp sugar</b></p> <p><b>1 tsp baking powder</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>1 egg</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp melted butter</b></p> <p><b>5 tbsp buttermilk (or low-fat yoghurt)</b></p> <p><b>2 spring onions, roughly chopped</b></p> <p><b>Cress</b></p> <p>For the herb cheese</p> <p><b> 500g fromage blanc, drained in a sieve for an hour</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>tbsp tarragon vinegar</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>2 shallots, finely chopped</b></p> <p><b>1 clove garlic, crushed</b></p> <p><b>Large handful mixed fresh herbs - parsley, watercress, mint, dill, chives, chervil - all finely chopped</b></p> <p>Beat the oil and vinegar into the fromage blanc, add the shallots, garlic, herbs and seasoning, and mix well. Leave in a sieve for at least half-an-hour - the longer you leave it, the firmer it gets. Turn it out, and cut into chunks.</p> <p>Preheat oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Butter a bun tin, and put in the fridge for 10 minutes. Sift the flour, baking powder and cornflour into a large bowl, then add the polenta and sugar. In another bowl, whisk the butter, egg, buttermilk, seasoning and spring onions together, then carefully fold in the dry-ingredient mixture.</p> <p>Pour into the bun moulds and bake for about 15 minutes, until golden and coming away from the sides slightly. Loosen with a knife, lift out and leave to cool on a wire rack. Cut the buns in half, fill with the herb cheese and a little cress.</p> <p><b> Picnic mess</b></p> <p>A variation on Eton mess - please note: unless you work very quickly, adding cocoa to the meringue mix causes it to lose its cloudlike quality.</p> <p><b> 4 egg whites</b></p> <p><b>200g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>45g cocoa powder</b></p> <p><b>1 tub mascarpone</b></p> <p><b>1 tub Greek yoghurt</b></p> <p><b>vanilla pod</b></p> <p><b>100g strawberries</b></p> <p><b>100g raspberries</b></p> <p><b>100g blueberries</b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp caster sugar, for the fruit</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 135C/275F/gas mark 1, and line a tray with baking parchment. Whisk the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add 30g of the sugar, whisking all the while - the egg whites should become shiny. Sift the cocoa into the rest of the sugar, and quickly fold into the meringue mixture. Working as fast as you can, spoon blobs of the meringue mix on to the tray and bake for one to one-and-a-half hours until dry and crisp. Leave to cool.</p> <p>Hull the strawberries, place in a bowl with the raspberries and blueberries, sprinkle with two tablespoons of caster sugar, cover and leave to macerate. Beat the mascarpone and Greek yoghurt together with the remaining two tablespoons of sugar and the contents of the vanilla pod.</p> <p>When everything is ready, crush the meringues a little and fold them into the cheese/yoghurt mix. Stir in the fruit, saving a few bits to scatter on top later. For a picnic, it's a good idea to spoon the mess into individual jam jars, to make it easy to transport.</p> <p><b> Lemon barley water</b></p> <p><b>110g pearl barley</b></p> <p><b>110g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>2 lemons, zested and juiced</b></p> <p><b>1 litre boiling water</b></p> <p>Place the barley, sugar, lemon juice and zest in a bowl, pour over the boiling water, cover and leave to cool.

      "bodyText": "It's a wet Wednesday lunchtime when Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, arrives at Anna Waddell's family home in Holloway, north London. The plan is - or at least it was until the heavens opened - to help 18-year-old Anna prepare a farewell picnic for her brothers, sisters and their respective broods. Anna is unfazed by the dreadful July weather, perhaps because she'll soon be well out of it: before starting university in the autumn, the jammy so-and-so is off with Raleigh International to Belize for three months, where one of her responsibilities - other than working on the tan, of course - will be to monitor fer de lance snakes (big fangs, very poisonous: on second thoughts, let's strike that \"jammy\" part). Anyway, the intrepid explorer is leaving in three days, and isn't remotely organised, let alone packed. Which is where the Kitchen Doctor comes in: would she mind \"helping out a bit\", Anna had wondered. To begin with, Anna's notion of \"a bit\" is more your average person's idea of \"a lot\", as she keeps disappearing to answer phone calls from friends wanting to catch up. Rosie doesn't seem to mind, however; she just unpacks her knives and instructs Practical Polly, her assistant for the day, to make the pesto, roast the peppers and bake the muffins. The sound of chopping and whirring entices Anna away from the phone, and Rosie promptly sits her down for a lesson on the ins and outs of making chocolate meringue for the Picnic Mess. \"Why's it called a mess?\" asks Anna, as you would. \"Because that's just what it is,\" Rosie replies. \"A big mess of lots of yummy stuff all mixed up together.\" Anna looks unconvinced. \"Wait till you try it,\" says Rosie, and pops the meringues into the oven. Next, it's on to the chicken roll-ups. \"Have you got a whacky thing, that I can use to flatten the chicken breasts?\" asks the KD. \"A whacky thing?\" repeats Anna, being unfamiliar with highfalutin culinary terminology. \"Never mind, I'll use this frying pan instead,\" says Rosie, then beats seven bells out of the chicken pieces until they are so flat that they look as if a juggernaut has run over them. Then she shows Anna how to construct the rolls, spreading them with Polly's pesto and strips of roasted pepper, before rolling the whole lot up in cling-film. \"Oh dear, I haven't done that right,\" Rosie says of her initial attempt. \"You're meant to be able to tie the ends together.\" \"What, like this?\" says Anna, whose own trial run has been altogether more successful. \"Er, yes . . . how did you manage to do that?\" Rather chastened, Rosie stands up and sticks her head into the oven. Only to check on the meringues, mind. \"Oh dear, how did that happen?\" she mutters. \"They're more not-very-risen-at-all-really brown blobs than meringues.\" \"It's a bit temperamental, heat-wise,\" explains Anna, at which Rosie shoves her bare arm into the depths of the oven: \"I see what you mean,\" she declares as everyone else winces, \"but it'll have to do.\" The KD then points at the packets of fresh herbs lined up waiting to go into the herby cheese filling for the muffins and the marinade for the Greek salad on a stick (devised, she says, because she adores cheesy snacks - \"Cheesy as in tacky, not dairy\"). Anna obediently sets to, tackling first the mint, then the parsley, then the dill and chives, before lifting up the final bunch of feathery leaves: \"What's this?\" \"Chervil,\" mumbles Rosie, her attention diverted by the task of pastry-rolling. \"Gerbil!?\" says Anna, just a touch alarmed. \"No: cher-vil,\" says Rosie, enunciating this time, but beginning to look flustered. The rain clouds have put paid to the picnic on Hampstead Heath, and she's got to have everything ready within the hour, so they can drive it round to Anna's brother David's house. She spreads half the pastry on an enamel plate, scatters over some chopped bacon, breaks the eggs on top and pops on a pastry lid: \"My mum always made this for picnics. It's my absolute favourite - she'd always cook it on enamel, then wrap it up in old newspaper, and it would stay warm for ages. Have you got a pastry brush, by the way?\" \"A what?\" says Anna, still not up to speed on her culinary expressions. \"To glaze the pastry with,\" explains Rosie. \"Don't think so,\" says Anna. \"But I've got a paintbrush. And an old make-up brush. Shall I go and get it? \"I think not,\" advises Rosie sagely. Half an hour later, the pies are ready, and there's a mad rush to pack everything up and into the car, before speeding off to David's, where assorted siblings, nephews and nieces have assembled. The rain has abated for now, and after a hasty family meeting it is decided to risk the back garden - they're a fearless lot, these Waddells. A blanket is laid out on the lawn, Rosie unpacks the spread, the Waddell hordes take one look and then dive in with \"oooohs\" and \"aaaaahs\" aplenty. Rosie allows herself a quiet smile as she leaves them to it, another job well done. All recipes serve four. Greek salad on a stick 24 cherry tomatoes cucumber, cut down the middle lengthwise, seeds removed 1-2 large red onions, peeled 225g feta, cut into cubes 55g pitted black olives 1 large handful mint, roughly chopped 1 smal handful flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped 12 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 5 tbsp lemon juice Salt and pepper 12 wooden skewers Mix together the oil, lemon juice, seasoning and herbs (test the feta for saltiness first). Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons and the onions into eighths. An hour before your picnic outing is to commence, throw everything into a big bowl and leave to marinade, turning from time to time. Ten minutes before departure, thread alternate bits on to the skewers including at least two of everything, and cut off the skewers' pointy ends with scissors. Bacon-and-egg pie This is best made on a 26cm enamel plate, but a shallow cake tin of the same size will be fine. 250g puff pastry 4 rashers smoked back bacon, chopped up 4 eggs Salt and pepper Milk, for glazing 1 small knob butter, for greasing Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Roll the pastry into two thin circles. Use one to line the greased plate/tin, sprinkle the bacon over the base, break the eggs evenly around and just prick the yolks so they run slightly. Season and then carefully lay on the other pastry round, brushing a little milk around the join to ensure the lid seals properly. Cut a cross in the centre of the lid, brush with a little milk and bake for about 35 minutes, until the top is golden and the pie has puffed up. Leave the pie to cool slightly, then wrap in a cloth followed by about five layers of newspaper tied with string. Chicken roll-ups 4 boneless chicken breasts 3 medium-sized red peppers 2 large handfuls fresh basil 25g pinenuts 1 clove garlic 55g Parmesan, grated 75ml olive oil Salt and pepper 1 packet soft tortillas Large handful rocket Roast the peppers in a hot oven until charred (alternatively, grill them over a flame), then put in a bowl while still hot and cover tightly with cling-film. When they are cool enough to handle, peel and deseed the peppers, cut them into strips, season and put to one side. Next, make the pesto: place the basil, pinenuts, garlic and seasoning in a food processor, along with two tablespoons of the olive oil, whizz to a pur\u00e9e, then gradually pour in the rest of the oil. Stir in the cheese, and set aside. Place a chicken breast between two sheets of cling-film and bash it flat with a rolling pin. Repeat with the other breasts. Remove the top layer of film, and spread the chicken with pesto, the red pepper strips and seasoning. Then, using the remaining piece of clingfilm to help you, roll it up like a sort of Swiss roll. Twist the ends of the cling-film, and tie together, so you have a neat, firm roll. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes. Fill a large pan with cold water and bring to the boil, season the water then poach the chicken roll-ups in their cling-film casings for about 15 minutes until just cooked through. Leave them to cool, then remove their cling-film wrappings. If you have any roasted peppers left, whizz them up with any left-over pesto. Spread the flat breads with the pepper pesto, put the rocket on top, then pop in the chicken, fold in the ends of the tortilla and roll them up. Wrap in paper and twist the ends, so that it looks like a cracker, then cut in half on a slight diagonal. Herb-cheese 'muffins' These are really more a savoury madeleine stuffed with a herb cheese that is often served as part of the cheese course in south-west France. 65g flour 50g polenta 30g cornflour 1 tbsp sugar 1 tsp baking powder Salt and pepper 1 egg 1 tbsp melted butter 5 tbsp buttermilk (or low-fat yoghurt) 2 spring onions, roughly chopped Cress For the herb cheese 500g fromage blanc, drained in a sieve for an hour 2 tbsp olive oil tbsp tarragon vinegar Salt and pepper 2 shallots, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, crushed Large handful mixed fresh herbs - parsley, watercress, mint, dill, chives, chervil - all finely chopped Beat the oil and vinegar into the fromage blanc, add the shallots, garlic, herbs and seasoning, and mix well. Leave in a sieve for at least half-an-hour - the longer you leave it, the firmer it gets. Turn it out, and cut into chunks. Preheat oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Butter a bun tin, and put in the fridge for 10 minutes. Sift the flour, baking powder and cornflour into a large bowl, then add the polenta and sugar. In another bowl, whisk the butter, egg, buttermilk, seasoning and spring onions together, then carefully fold in the dry-ingredient mixture. Pour into the bun moulds and bake for about 15 minutes, until golden and coming away from the sides slightly. Loosen with a knife, lift out and leave to cool on a wire rack. Cut the buns in half, fill with the herb cheese and a little cress. Picnic mess A variation on Eton mess - please note: unless you work very quickly, adding cocoa to the meringue mix causes it to lose its cloudlike quality. 4 egg whites 200g caster sugar 45g cocoa powder 1 tub mascarpone 1 tub Greek yoghurt vanilla pod 100g strawberries 100g raspberries 100g blueberries 4 tbsp caster sugar, for the fruit Preheat the oven to 135C/275F/gas mark 1, and line a tray with baking parchment. Whisk the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add 30g of the sugar, whisking all the while - the egg whites should become shiny. Sift the cocoa into the rest of the sugar, and quickly fold into the meringue mixture. Working as fast as you can, spoon blobs of the meringue mix on to the tray and bake for one to one-and-a-half hours until dry and crisp. Leave to cool. Hull the strawberries, place in a bowl with the raspberries and blueberries, sprinkle with two tablespoons of caster sugar, cover and leave to macerate. Beat the mascarpone and Greek yoghurt together with the remaining two tablespoons of sugar and the contents of the vanilla pod. When everything is ready, crush the meringues a little and fold them into the cheese/yoghurt mix. Stir in the fruit, saving a few bits to scatter on top later. For a picnic, it's a good idea to spoon the mess into individual jam jars, to make it easy to transport. Lemon barley water 110g pearl barley 110g caster sugar 2 lemons, zested and juiced 1 litre boiling water Place the barley, sugar, lemon juice and zest in a bowl, pour over the boiling water, cover and leave to cool. When it is cold, strain into a bottle and pack up for the picnic. Farewell fizz This recipe was given me by my great friend Polly, who was an invaluable kitchen-hand today. 2 lemons 6 sprigs lemon balm or mint 110g sugar 600ml water 375ml dessert wine 100ml brandy 1 bottle champagne/sparkling wine Finely grate the zest of one of the lemons. Cut the skin off both of them, removing all the pith, and slice the fruit very thinly. Put everything except the fizz in a big jug (you might like to drop in a few borage flowers, too, to make it look all summery and picnic-like), stir to dissolve the sugar and chill for at least an hour. Pour into a bottle and pack into your picnic box, along with the bottle of chilled champagne. To serve, half-fill plastic beakers with the mixture and top up with the sparkling wine \u0095 Do you have a worrying culinary dilemma? In a flap over fish, say, or psyched out by puddings?

      "body": "<p>We meet, the Iranian artist Shirin Neshat and I, in the desert - Death Valley, California; the American desert, sure, but still an apt place for the paths of two strangers to cross. A neutral place, you could say. Home to nothing but coyotes and rattlesnakes, where the land stretches out before you flat and unadorned like so much bleached Tarmac. Neshat takes me 100 or so miles north-east, to the old goldmining town of Tonopah. It's like a ghost town, haunted by its own past. All the mines are closed now; the casino is shut up; most of its little motels are empty. </p> <p>Neshat is here, from her New York home, with a group of Iranian friends, her artistic collaborators since 1998 - director Shoja Azari, cinematographer Ghasem Ebrahimian, actors Mohamed Ghaffari and Shahram Karimi - to make a film based on Kafka's black comedy, The Penal Colony. In the past 10 years, working as a visual artist, she has moved from stills photography, a single image, to film installations, usually dual projections with music in the place of words; still visual art, but moving closer to film. \"I had begun to feel, even early on, a kind of resentment about visual art that you are expected to stay in one place, within one discipline.\" She likes a cross-disciplinary approach. \"It gives me a freedom, it enables me to keep a distance from visual art, from cinema. Because I am nothing entirely. I am in between.\" </p> <p>The way they work, she explains, is to play different parts on each others' projects. Azari, for instance, was in her film Turbulent; the Kafka is his project, he is directing while Neshat works on costumes. The next film will be directed by Ebrahimian. They are \"a team\" she says, but with no leader, no single authority, no all-prevailing point of view. </p> <p>She has learned, she says, with these people, and as an artist, the danger of pushing a point of view. They have in common Iran, Islam, but their backgrounds and experience are very different. Azari was a student activist, imprisoned after the revolution, who escaped from Iran. Neshat went to America in 1974, at 17, four years before the revolution, and returned for the first time in 1990. Since then, she has been going back and forth, making work that doesn't try to validate or repudiate Islam. \"People ask, 'Where are you coming from? What do you really think about Islam? What is your work trying to say?' I have been criticised for not taking a position, for not having a point of view.\" But, for her, these are the wrong questions, depending on the assumption that the world is singular, that all that differs is where you are standing. Which becomes in turn an expression not of any truth about the world, merely of how you see it. \"Everyone has a point of view. I don't happen to find that very interesting.\" Put simplistically, there is a view of Islam that it is demonic. A view of Islam that it is sacred. No possibility of dialogue exists between the two. You can say no point of view is valid. You can say every point of view is equally valid. Impasse. </p> <p>But what happens if you flip this around. If you make not the world but the point of view fixed, make it somewhere in the middle, and spin different worlds around this. Neshat's most recent film work has played with this idea. Two screens running simultaneously, presenting parallel worlds, parallel stories, in some ways clearly oppositional but with points of intersection, and the viewer always in between. It's her reply to the question \"Who are you?\" Again the wrong question. And the answer, \"I am in between.\" </p> <p>She must have started out knowing where she came from. She is the fourth of five children of wealthy parents, brought up in the religious town of Qazvin in north-western Iran. Her father was a doctor, her mother a housewife, but westernised. \"My parents both adored the Shah. Our lifestyle changed so much under the Shah. We had his picture on the wall. They would never believe what they heard about Savak, about his secret police. They couldn't accept that.\" Certain traditional values were observed. The daughters would never go to the bazaar or enter a mosque unveiled. \"Out of respect, out of tradition. Not for religious reasons.\" Her father refused to go to the movie theatre. \"He felt it would ruin his reputation.\" Through her grandparents, her mother's parents, she learned traditional religious values. \"My grandmother always wore the veil, she prayed each day. Both my grandparents disliked the Shah.\" Her father's view prevailed, and he wanted his children educated at boarding school in Tehran and then at university in the US. He bought the image of the west that the Shah offered. \"He fantasised about the west, romanticised the west, and slowly rejected all his own values; both my parents did. What happened, I think, was that their identity slowly dissolved, they exchanged it for comfort. It served their class.\" </p> <p>Even in the early-70s, dissent in Iran was becoming obvious. At school, she had friends who listened to Khomeini's broadcasts from Iraq. \"Though I didn't.\" She played no part in the increasing student radicalism. As the gap between rich and poor widened, an alliance was forged between the intellectuals, the religious and the poor. \"People were fed up with the west. There was a strong intellectual movement to reinterpret Islam in a contemporary way, to make sense of it as a philosophy, not just a religious ideology. And a feeling that it could be re-organised, readapted, and it could work. The desire for purification, to get rid of the west, to bring back something that reflected our history. A sense of democracy to do with community, with devotion, sacrifice.\" </p> <p>And it was at roughly this moment that she was sent to college in America by her father; it would not have occurred to her to protest. Cut off from the experience of her peers, from her own history, arriving in the US as Watergate broke, she made attempts to adapt. Joined Iranian organisations, \"which did nothing, could do nothing but talk\". Married, twice. First an Afro-American. Then a Korean, with whom she has her son, Cyrus. At home, the revolution broke, then the Iran-Iraq war, with Iran being bombed every day. She could not get in touch with her parents. Her sisters and brother had already returned home. She was completely alone. And for her the myth of the west just fell apart. She couldn't sustain some notion of herself as a point in someone else's - her father's, the Shah's - fantasy. The world that we take for granted in the west she saw as illusion. Without a mother, a father, a homeland, without loyalties, ambitions, she could no longer make sense of herself. She certainly couldn't be an artist. There were no clashes, no tensions out of which to make art. It seems obvious now that what was happening to her paralleled what had happened in her country under the Shah. The collapse of her identity into another's - the west's. So she worked with her husband in his art gallery. \"I didn't think about being an artist for another 10 years. It took me that long before I was mentally prepared.\" </p> <p>Going back to Iran was bound to be a process of regret; in a kind of reverse process of her father's idealisation of the west, she began to idealise Islam. She fell for the revolution, if not for its effect, for the impulse that had created it. And for the fall-out, the elevation of martyrdom. She envied her friends their \"12 years of nightmare\". \"I have to say I became very attracted to what they had gone through. When I looked at myself, at what I had gone through, it seemed I had spent my life without commitment. There was this need to be attracted by something other than my own reality. Something that could change me, wake me up.\" Looking around her she would think, \"I am from here. I look like everybody else. I haven't experienced anything of what they have gone through, but I belong here.\" It became an obsession. She felt angry with her family for sending her away. \"I felt I would have been a better person had I stayed.\" </p> <p>She found herself pleading with the culture ministry to let her design a sculpture for a national park. \"Then I remembered I can't sculpt.\" Every time she returned to America, depression would set in. As if in a love affair, she wanted what she'd found to last and never to change. Her first work after 1990, a series of photographs exhibited in 1993 and entitled Women Of Allah, reflects this naive longing. She had found her subject, women and Islam, and her boundary - Islam regarded on its own terms - but not yet the distance to reflect any ambiguity. So the photographs come over as prettified, almost chic, objects. Sometimes a sexual tease, a flirtation. A beautiful woman, Neshat herself, has her face bisected by a gun, with calligraphy, Farsi poetry, projected on to her face. Or a photograph of a woman's feet, again calligraphically inscribed, a gun held between the feet. Analytically, perhaps, interesting. The beauty of the body, the will to violence, the calligraphy indicating an intellectual and emotional engagement that women were not permitted to express. They are reflections, she says, on the military participation of women in the revolution: Islam trained women to fight in the Iran-Iraq war, the one area in which they could be equal to men. And the paradox of their enforced submissiveness and their strength. \"It is why I decided that women had to be the focus of my work because they embody, in a way men do not, the value systems of that society.\" </p> <p>She accepts now that the work was immature. \"I don't regret the early work. I had to do it. And I appreciate that naivety and pure obsession now. It came out of a sincerity. But it's true I see things differently now.\" The work was too structured, too accepting, but as brave as she could be at that time. It looked back. \"I started off making work that did seek to justify Islam. It was important for me to believe in something positive about Islam. Maybe to say: this makes no sense according to your, the west's, rationale. But you can't evaluate those people in your system of thinking.\" </p> <p>Then there is a leap, not of imagination, but of sensibility. As if the child, whose identity depends on authority, suddenly grows up. No adolescent phase, no rebellion, but a clear understanding that the world is the clash of incompatible points of view. East/west. Male/female. So far nothing new. But when she takes this idea and translates it into the world of Islam, into the closed world of women in Islam - a world closed to the west because it seems to us purely submissive, a world of victimhood. By no means a neutral world to us. For the women of Islam a closed world because of social controls: the veil; no access to the public domain; suppression of sexuality. So by no means a neutral world to them. She makes play of these differences, a creative tension close to drama. </p> <p>When Neshat first came to use film, she was influenced by the work of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose A Taste Of Cherry won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. \"What I love about Kiarostami is that he has created an aesthetic that works so sufficiently within the limitations. He doesn't go for controversial issues that would be attractive to the outsider and even more to Iranians. He stays detached. His films are culturally specific but he doesn't feed a fashionable curiosity about Islam. They are journeys, narratives and though they are in one way specific to Iran they are also universal.\" What she saw also in his work was precisely the kind of uncertainty about what the viewer is seeing, at the same time reality and illusion, that she wanted in her own work. </p> <p>She began experimenting, and in 1998 produced Turbulent, a split-screen installation, on one side a man, on the other a woman. Since then she has made two more films, Rapture in 1999 and Fervour in 2000: \"A trilogy based around the issues of gender.\" Unlike Kiarostami, who has no choice but to work within the limitations permitted, she chose to improvise within those boundaries. \"I am not making work in Iran, so I could have gone any way.\" When making the work, she thinks first about Iran. \"Because there are so many things that we don't ever discuss among ourselves. My intention is to formulate it in a way that, although it is very much about Iran, it touches on issues that go beyond our difference.\" </p> <p>There is common ground, she is saying. The idea that there is one world, one linear rational point of view that can ravel everything up into sense, is peculiarly male and by no means confined to the east. It is true, she says, that feminism as we understand it in the west, \"about equality, about creating a balance of effort\", could never apply in Islam. \"Women have their place, men have their place. It is never about being equal to men. Women accept their domestic responsibility; it is what gives them strength. They don't see themselves as submissive or victims. They break the rules, but they do it in a quiet, subtle way. I am not saying that the view of the outsider is completely false, but that it is exaggerated. So in my work I try to show that kind of candid feminism that can only be understood if you think about it in their terms.\" </p> <p>Fervour, she says, closes the chapter on the subject of gender. The screens are no longer opposite but next to each other. The sexual taboos that it focuses on apply both to man and woman, \"so I wanted them on the same side\". It opens with a man and a woman walking in a landscape, the desert. Momentarily, their paths intersect. They are alone. They stop for a moment. We can sense the sexual friction. They walk on. Later, at a public gathering, now separated from each other by a curtain, each becomes aware of the other's presence. A speaker addresses the crowd about the dangers of sexual desire. And finally, in a kind of disgust at herself, at the situation, at their mutual acquiescence in this taboo that says men and women who are strangers cannot touch, cannot even meet the other's gaze, the woman walks out. There are taboos, social codes that function externally, she is saying. These you can see. But just as insidious are the taboos that we carry within us. In that moment, even when alone, when no one could have seen them, they could not transgress. \"They may not be the same, but we all have these taboos, you know,\" she says </p> <p>\u0095 Shirin Neshat will show at the Serpentine Gallery, London, from July 28-September 3.</p>",

Neshat takes me 100 or so miles north-east, to the old goldmining town of Tonopah. It's like a ghost town, haunted by its own past. All the mines are closed now; the casino is shut up; most of its little motels are empty. Neshat is here, from her New York home, with a group of Iranian friends, her artistic collaborators since 1998 - director Shoja Azari, cinematographer Ghasem Ebrahimian, actors Mohamed Ghaffari and Shahram Karimi - to make a film based on Kafka's black comedy, The Penal Colony. In the past 10 years, working as a visual artist, she has moved from stills photography, a single image, to film installations, usually dual projections with music in the place of words; still visual art, but moving closer to film. \"I had begun to feel, even early on, a kind of resentment about visual art that you are expected to stay in one place, within one discipline.\" She likes a cross-disciplinary approach. \"It gives me a freedom, it enables me to keep a distance from visual art, from cinema. Because I am nothing entirely. I am in between.\" The way they work, she explains, is to play different parts on each others' projects. Azari, for instance, was in her film Turbulent; the Kafka is his project, he is directing while Neshat works on costumes. The next film will be directed by Ebrahimian. They are \"a team\" she says, but with no leader, no single authority, no all-prevailing point of view. She has learned, she says, with these people, and as an artist, the danger of pushing a point of view. They have in common Iran, Islam, but their backgrounds and experience are very different. Azari was a student activist, imprisoned after the revolution, who escaped from Iran. Neshat went to America in 1974, at 17, four years before the revolution, and returned for the first time in 1990. Since then, she has been going back and forth, making work that doesn't try to validate or repudiate Islam. \"People ask, 'Where are you coming from? What do you really think about Islam? What is your work trying to say?' I have been criticised for not taking a position, for not having a point of view.\" But, for her, these are the wrong questions, depending on the assumption that the world is singular, that all that differs is where you are standing. Which becomes in turn an expression not of any truth about the world, merely of how you see it. \"Everyone has a point of view. I don't happen to find that very interesting.\" Put simplistically, there is a view of Islam that it is demonic. A view of Islam that it is sacred. No possibility of dialogue exists between the two. You can say no point of view is valid. You can say every point of view is equally valid. Impasse. But what happens if you flip this around. If you make not the world but the point of view fixed, make it somewhere in the middle, and spin different worlds around this. Neshat's most recent film work has played with this idea. Two screens running simultaneously, presenting parallel worlds, parallel stories, in some ways clearly oppositional but with points of intersection, and the viewer always in between. It's her reply to the question \"Who are you?\" Again the wrong question. And the answer, \"I am in between.\" She must have started out knowing where she came from. She is the fourth of five children of wealthy parents, brought up in the religious town of Qazvin in north-western Iran. Her father was a doctor, her mother a housewife, but westernised. \"My parents both adored the Shah. Our lifestyle changed so much under the Shah. We had his picture on the wall. They would never believe what they heard about Savak, about his secret police. They couldn't accept that.\" Certain traditional values were observed. The daughters would never go to the bazaar or enter a mosque unveiled. \"Out of respect, out of tradition. Not for religious reasons.\" Her father refused to go to the movie theatre. \"He felt it would ruin his reputation.\" Through her grandparents, her mother's parents, she learned traditional religious values. \"My grandmother always wore the veil, she prayed each day. Both my grandparents disliked the Shah.\" Her father's view prevailed, and he wanted his children educated at boarding school in Tehran and then at university in the US. He bought the image of the west that the Shah offered. \"He fantasised about the west, romanticised the west, and slowly rejected all his own values; both my parents did. What happened, I think, was that their identity slowly dissolved, they exchanged it for comfort. It served their class.\" Even in the early-70s, dissent in Iran was becoming obvious. At school, she had friends who listened to Khomeini's broadcasts from Iraq. \"Though I didn't.\" She played no part in the increasing student radicalism. As the gap between rich and poor widened, an alliance was forged between the intellectuals, the religious and the poor. \"People were fed up with the west. There was a strong intellectual movement to reinterpret Islam in a contemporary way, to make sense of it as a philosophy, not just a religious ideology. And a feeling that it could be re-organised, readapted, and it could work. The desire for purification, to get rid of the west, to bring back something that reflected our history. A sense of democracy to do with community, with devotion, sacrifice.\" And it was at roughly this moment that she was sent to college in America by her father; it would not have occurred to her to protest. Cut off from the experience of her peers, from her own history, arriving in the US as Watergate broke, she made attempts to adapt. Joined Iranian organisations, \"which did nothing, could do nothing but talk\". Married, twice. First an Afro-American. Then a Korean, with whom she has her son, Cyrus. At home, the revolution broke, then the Iran-Iraq war, with Iran being bombed every day. She could not get in touch with her parents. Her sisters and brother had already returned home. She was completely alone. And for her the myth of the west just fell apart. She couldn't sustain some notion of herself as a point in someone else's - her father's, the Shah's - fantasy. The world that we take for granted in the west she saw as illusion. Without a mother, a father, a homeland, without loyalties, ambitions, she could no longer make sense of herself. She certainly couldn't be an artist. There were no clashes, no tensions out of which to make art. It seems obvious now that what was happening to her paralleled what had happened in her country under the Shah. The collapse of her identity into another's - the west's. So she worked with her husband in his art gallery. \"I didn't think about being an artist for another 10 years. It took me that long before I was mentally prepared.\" Going back to Iran was bound to be a process of regret; in a kind of reverse process of her father's idealisation of the west, she began to idealise Islam. She fell for the revolution, if not for its effect, for the impulse that had created it. And for the fall-out, the elevation of martyrdom. She envied her friends their \"12 years of nightmare\". \"I have to say I became very attracted to what they had gone through. When I looked at myself, at what I had gone through, it seemed I had spent my life without commitment. There was this need to be attracted by something other than my own reality. Something that could change me, wake me up.\" Looking around her she would think, \"I am from here. I look like everybody else. I haven't experienced anything of what they have gone through, but I belong here.\" It became an obsession. She felt angry with her family for sending her away. \"I felt I would have been a better person had I stayed.\" She found herself pleading with the culture ministry to let her design a sculpture for a national park. \"Then I remembered I can't sculpt.\" Every time she returned to America, depression would set in. As if in a love affair, she wanted what she'd found to last and never to change. Her first work after 1990, a series of photographs exhibited in 1993 and entitled Women Of Allah, reflects this naive longing. She had found her subject, women and Islam, and her boundary - Islam regarded on its own terms - but not yet the distance to reflect any ambiguity. So the photographs come over as prettified, almost chic, objects. Sometimes a sexual tease, a flirtation. A beautiful woman, Neshat herself, has her face bisected by a gun, with calligraphy, Farsi poetry, projected on to her face. Or a photograph of a woman's feet, again calligraphically inscribed, a gun held between the feet. Analytically, perhaps, interesting. The beauty of the body, the will to violence, the calligraphy indicating an intellectual and emotional engagement that women were not permitted to express. They are reflections, she says, on the military participation of women in the revolution: Islam trained women to fight in the Iran-Iraq war, the one area in which they could be equal to men. And the paradox of their enforced submissiveness and their strength. \"It is why I decided that women had to be the focus of my work because they embody, in a way men do not, the value systems of that society.\" She accepts now that the work was immature. \"I don't regret the early work. I had to do it. And I appreciate that naivety and pure obsession now. It came out of a sincerity. But it's true I see things differently now.\" The work was too structured, too accepting, but as brave as she could be at that time. It looked back. \"I started off making work that did seek to justify Islam. It was important for me to believe in something positive about Islam. Maybe to say: this makes no sense according to your, the west's, rationale. But you can't evaluate those people in your system of thinking.\" Then there is a leap, not of imagination, but of sensibility. As if the child, whose identity depends on authority, suddenly grows up. No adolescent phase, no rebellion, but a clear understanding that the world is the clash of incompatible points of view. East/west. Male/female. So far nothing new. But when she takes this idea and translates it into the world of Islam, into the closed world of women in Islam - a world closed to the west because it seems to us purely submissive, a world of victimhood. By no means a neutral world to us. For the women of Islam a closed world because of social controls: the veil; no access to the public domain; suppression of sexuality. So by no means a neutral world to them. She makes play of these differences, a creative tension close to drama. When Neshat first came to use film, she was influenced by the work of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose A Taste Of Cherry won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. \"What I love about Kiarostami is that he has created an aesthetic that works so sufficiently within the limitations. He doesn't go for controversial issues that would be attractive to the outsider and even more to Iranians. He stays detached. His films are culturally specific but he doesn't feed a fashionable curiosity about Islam. They are journeys, narratives and though they are in one way specific to Iran they are also universal.\" What she saw also in his work was precisely the kind of uncertainty about what the viewer is seeing, at the same time reality and illusion, that she wanted in her own work. She began experimenting, and in 1998 produced Turbulent, a split-screen installation, on one side a man, on the other a woman. Since then she has made two more films, Rapture in 1999 and Fervour in 2000: \"A trilogy based around the issues of gender.\" Unlike Kiarostami, who has no choice but to work within the limitations permitted, she chose to improvise within those boundaries. \"I am not making work in Iran, so I could have gone any way.\" When making the work, she thinks first about Iran. \"Because there are so many things that we don't ever discuss among ourselves. My intention is to formulate it in a way that, although it is very much about Iran, it touches on issues that go beyond our difference.\" There is common ground, she is saying. The idea that there is one world, one linear rational point of view that can ravel everything up into sense, is peculiarly male and by no means confined to the east. It is true, she says, that feminism as we understand it in the west, \"about equality, about creating a balance of effort\", could never apply in Islam. \"Women have their place, men have their place. It is never about being equal to men. Women accept their domestic responsibility; it is what gives them strength. They don't see themselves as submissive or victims. They break the rules, but they do it in a quiet, subtle way. I am not saying that the view of the outsider is completely false, but that it is exaggerated. So in my work I try to show that kind of candid feminism that can only be understood if you think about it in their terms.\" Fervour, she says, closes the chapter on the subject of gender. The screens are no longer opposite but next to each other. The sexual taboos that it focuses on apply both to man and woman, \"so I wanted them on the same side\". It opens with a man and a woman walking in a landscape, the desert. Momentarily, their paths intersect. They are alone. They stop for a moment. We can sense the sexual friction. They walk on. Later, at a public gathering, now separated from each other by a curtain, each becomes aware of the other's presence. A speaker addresses the crowd about the dangers of sexual desire. And finally, in a kind of disgust at herself, at the situation, at their mutual acquiescence in this taboo that says men and women who are strangers cannot touch, cannot even meet the other's gaze, the woman walks out. There are taboos, social codes that function externally, she is saying. These you can see. But just as insidious are the taboos that we carry within us. In that moment, even when alone, when no one could have seen them, they could not transgress. \"They may not be the same, but we all have these taboos, you know,\" she says \u0095 Shirin Neshat will show at the Serpentine Gallery, London, from July 28-September 3.",

Even this early in the morning, pre-styling, pre-hair-and-make-up, they look unfeasibly fresh and fragrant, as if they have just stepped out of an Organics shampoo advert. They are also small, though not Kylie tiny, but small and well-turned-out. Just like the pop music they make. In the studio where we are gathered for a photo-shoot, they try on a succession of pants and tops, trading quips and one-liners, as only sisters do. The Corrs, it seems, are having fun with their fame.</p> <p>You cannot imagine their names attached to headlines concerning mysteriously cancelled shows or dead-of-night admissions to the Priory. They are too no-nonsense Irish, too grounded, too un-neurotic. Neither, though, are they as squeaky-clean as their carefully modulated image might suggest. They could \"drink the Gallagher brothers under the table\", I was told. And their live shows, while never coming close to the Dionysian ideal, do rock, after a fashion. Bono, of U2, recalls attending a performance in Dublin last year: \"They came out, plugged in, and it was Bam ! The volume! I'd been to see Garbage the night before and, believe me, Garbage are a loud band. I mean really loud. But the Corrs were louder.\" </p> <p>The Corrs are shadowed by some more disturbing pop precedents: the whole twisted history of the family-that-plays-together, from the Partridge Family to the Osmonds, from the Carpenters to the Jacksons and even the Gallaghers. Here, we pop-watchers assume, lies dysfunction: dear dead Karen Carpenter, poor weird Michael Jackson, not to mention the spiralling, very public sibling rivalry that is the ongoing Noel and Liam show. Then, of course, there's also the spectre of the Irish musical family, that all-grinning, all-singing lineage that stretches back to the 60s (which, in Ireland, lest we forget, were never even remotely \"swinging\") and the three brothers who called themselves the Bachelors (what manner of latent, quintessentially Irish longings/denials lay beneath that name), and, in the 80s, that gaggle of lip-glossed glam-girls, the Nolan sisters. What dark well of familial secrets lurks beneath that relentlessly happy-go-lucky, rinky-dinky, we-are-family professionalism? </p> <p>It's no use asking the Corrs, I fear. They don't seem to fit into either camp. That said, there is an undeniable - there's no other word for it - niceness about them and their music. It is not tiresomely-wholesome Dana niceness, nor even smug Ronan-from-Boyzone niceness, both of which, you suspect, conceal a heart of steel and an ambition that began as over-vaulting and grew: Dana ran for president of Ireland, while Ronan recently admitted, without irony, that he might one day do the same. It is, though, a peculiarly Irish niceness. A professional niceness that is eager to please, unremittingly polite, and practised with an unstated understanding that you are not just letting yourself down if you misbehave, but also your town, your country and, of course, your family. </p> <p>These traditional values still hold fast in the new Ireland, much more so than they do in Blairite, post-Thatcher Britain. Why else does the Eurovision Song Contest remain such an obsession and a source of pride in Ireland whereas everywhere else it has long since passed into post-ironic campness? </p> <p>Though the Corrs are part of the new, confident, supposedly European Ireland that grew up in tandem with U2's global ascendancy, they also straddle the enduring, traditional Ireland. You could link their extraordinary global success to the post-Riverdance marketing of a kind of faux-Irish pop heritage, but their roots, musically at least, defy such a pat explanation. They did not grow up playing Irish traditional music in sessions and festivals: they began life as a late-80s synthesiser-pop band, all four playing keyboards over programmed beats. Their shared influences were Prince, the Police, Nick Kershaw and, naturally, U2. You can, if you listen closely, hear all of these influences in their shiny, bright pop, just as you will look in vain for angst \u00e0 la Sinead O'Connor or Pogues-type pandemonium. The Corrs may incorporate elements of Irish traditionalism into their set, but they do not play it with the conviction that attends their own sleekly modern take on traditional pop, which is where their strength and durability lies. Their antecedents are Abba and the Carpenters, and even Blondie, not the angst merchants that I depend on to reflect and assuage my dark confusions. </p> <p>Not being a Corrs fan before meeting them, I listen to their entire recorded output, the way I would normally listen to a new Radiohead or Neil Young album. What I hear is crafted, somewhat airbrushed, melodic pop, which at times subtly utilises elements of Irish traditional playing. </p> <p>I am not fired up by their songs but I am surprised more than once - mostly by the grain of Andrea Corr's voice, which was recently described by their current producer, the wonderfully named Mutt Lange, \"as the best pop voice in the world right now\". For me, it was more the undertow of plaintive sadness that surfaces from time to time, like a kink in a beautifully woven piece of fabric. Listen to how she phrases the line \"no more waiting, no more aching\" on What Can I Do: that perfectly pitched pause before she lights on and stretches the last two syllables into a suggestion of pure regret. Then imagine what Burt Bacharach could do with a voice like that. </p> <p>In the flesh, as on stage and in camera, Andrea looks the sultriest Corr, even - especially - when, knees tucked under her chin, she starts to suck her thumb, lost in some private reverie. She is the child of the family, the one who began singing with the band when she was still at school, the one whose flirtatious gaze has graced numerous magazine covers; she is the one whom the tabloids seek out, linking her to a succession of ever more unlikely young men, the most recent being Robbie Williams - \"Do you think it's physically possible,\" she protests, \"to go out with all those guys that the press have said?\" Behind the pout, though, there is a brain. Her favourite book is Dostoyevsky's Crime And Punishment: \"I'm just drawn to the insight into the psychology of the mind, the conflicts about what's morally right. It's the head stuff I like.\" </p> <p>Sharon, 28, the eldest sister, is altogether more poised, elegant even. You can't imagine her sucking her thumb. Sharon plays the violin, is classically trained, and may succeed in making that unlikely pop instrument as sexy as the guitar. She is \"in a long-term relationship\" and spends a lot of time in her fianc\u00e9's home town, Belfast, where \"the people are lovely and you don't get hassled so much\". </p> <p>Caroline, the middle sister, has been described as the tomboy of the group, perhaps because she is the drummer. Tomboy or not, she has that practical, no-nonsense approach characteristic of those who make their living hitting skins with sticks. She wolfs down three bacon sandwiches before the photo-shoot. She seems bemused but unfazed by the turn her life has taken: \"For a long time, I had no idea what we were doing,\" she laughs. \"I was a teenager and it was all a bit of a laugh. Looking back, I still can't believe the cheek of us.\" </p> <p>Brother Jim seems more reserved than his sisters. In the words of a recent pop magazine profile, he exudes \"the stoical air of a guy used to waiting his turn in the bathroom\". He is, says Caroline, \"the initiator\", the Corr who kick-started this whole adventure, who galvanised his sisters into rehearsing long into the night while two of them were still at school studying for the Irish equivalent of A-levels. Jim, you feel, is the most ambitious member of the Corrs, the one who always saw the bigger picture. \"We haven't yet achieved the level of success we'd like in America,\" he tells me later. \"We may have to go there more often, maybe even live there. In this game, you've got to be in people's faces.\" </p> <p>Which is exactly where the Corrs - these three implausibly photogenic girls-next-door and their unassuming but driven older brother - have been since the global crossover success of their second album, 1997's Talk On Corners. If you are not familiar with the Corrs already, believe me, you soon will be. The new album, In Blue, their fourth in 10 years, will pitch them even higher into the pop stratosphere. It will be ubiquitous - on the radio, in wine bars, restaurants and shops, seeping into your head like a soft drug. </p> <p>Breathless, the first single from In Blue, has gone straight into the charts at number one. All the classic components of a Corrs hit song are present: a deceptively simple and catchy melody, a chorus that lodges itself in the listener's brain, a polished production that nestles somewhere between pure pop and soft rock, the whole overlaid with Andrea's sexy-angelic voice and her sisters' crystal-clear, soaring harmonies. Breathless, like the hit singles that preceded it, most notably So Young and What Can I Do, is further evidence that the Corrs have hit on an aural signature, an immediately identifiable sound that has just enough space for melodic innovation each time it is unfurled anew. </p> <p>To really understand the Corr's success you have to put them in their context. In an increasingly infantile pop landscape ruled by manufactured irritants - from Boyzone to Billie, from B*witched to Britney - the Corrs are, almost alone, flying the flag for organic pop, that is, music composed, recorded and performed on real instruments. In short, they play pop music that sounds the way pop used to sound, before drum machines and samplers, before the tidal wave of gormless boy bands and grinning girls groups, before mindless techno remixes and insipid cover versions became all the rage. \"We did CD UK [an ITV Saturday-morning music showcase] the other day,\" says Jim Corr, \"and we were the only band with instruments. Apart from us, there wasn't a guitar or a drum or a keyboard in sight. It's sad, but the ability actually to play music has somehow taken second place.\" </p> <p>There is, then, something comfortably old-fashioned about the Corrs' music, and that something is central to their success. At a time when the most relentlessly targeted audience for pop music is 10- to 13-year-olds, the Corrs possess a mass appeal that stretches way beyond established music-business demographics. The audience who turned up to see them perform at this year's Fleadh in London's Finsbury Park, that increasingly raggle-taggle representation of Celtic, and Celtic-related, music, were remarkable in one way only: they crossed all age boundaries. Sure, the group may attract an above-average degree of slavering boys (and men), but, ultimately, a Corrs concert is pop as family entertainment. \"If you look at pop music right now, it's like everyone's throwing a line into these small stretches of river - dance, pop, rock, whatever,\" says Bono. \"Then, a hundred yards up, there is this huge stretch of riverside, and the Corrs have it all to themselves. They've got the pop fans, but they've also pulled this huge audience of people out there who have a heart, soul and ears, but who are not interested in modern pop because they are older, or more discerning, or simply don't get it. And, I have to say, there's something really refreshing about a band who haven't the tiniest regard for street cred. They know what it is, but they're just not interested.\" </p> <p>It took a long while, however, for the Corrs' unique selling point to dawn on the British music industry. When they arrived on these shores, with their fiddles and bodhrans and poppy-rocky-Irish folky songs, at the height of the Britpop phenomenon in the mid-90s, they met with a litany of rejection. \"People were quite suspicious of us initially,\" says Caroline, \"because we simply didn't fit. We seemed to bubble under for ages in Britain.\" </p> <p>Their manager, John Hughes, is less circumspect. \"I went into the marketplace, saying, 'I have this Irish family band who write their own stuff and play it on whistles and fiddles and bodhrans, as well as guitars, drums and keyboards', and the record company people looked at me with pity. It was like, 'They're gorgeous, I'll give you that, but it stops there... By the way, what the hell's a bodhran?' \" </p> <p>British radio, too, all but ignored the group initially: the Corrs did not make the Radio 1 playlist until they released a cover version of Fleetwood Mac's soft-rock classic, Dreams, in 1997. \"It was kind of frustrating,\" remembers Sharon, \"because the inference was that we were too unfashionable to be successful. We weren't Britpop or Girl Power, or whatever was in vogue at the time, but that, ultimately, was our strength. We could see it, but the radio programmers and the record companies couldn't. We just stuck to our guns and made the music we believed in.\" </p> <p>It was a US label that snapped up the Corrs initially, after John Hughes took the most audacious gamble of his life. On a trip to New York in 1994, he marched the fledgling Corrs unannounced into an uptown recording studio where David Foster, the most commercially successful producer in pop, was working on Michael Jackson's HIStory album. Intrigued by their cheek as much as anything, Foster granted the group an audition there and then: they played an acoustic set in his office, and, on his recommendation, were signed to Atlantic Records within days. </p> <p>Jason Frome, the A&amp;R man who actually signed them, recalls, \"When they walked into my New York office, I was immediately taken by their beauty, their obvious grace and style. They played me a cassette with Love To Love You and Closer on it, then they told me they played all the instruments themselves and wrote the songs. Man, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.\" </p> <p>Within months, Foster was producing the Corrs' first album, Forgiven Not Forgotten, which has sold nearly four million copies. The follow-up, Talk On Corners, in 1997, has just passed the seven million mark. \"In a way,\" says Hughes in his downbeat way, \"you make your own luck. Then you work your ass off selling your music door to door, country to country.\" Which is what the Corrs have been doing ever since. Their touring itinerary has been relentless, the marketing of their music and image unwavering. Recently, they have looked noticeably more stylish, a cool and sexy designer look replacing the floaty, silky wispiness of before. In their new ad campaign, they look utterly now . All this, you think, is geared towards a subtle but crucial shift in their image. The new look, like the new music, is slightly edgier, imperceptibly tougher, though they still seem slightly uncomfortable with the promotion process. </p> <p>\"Nobody should ever be seen this much, and no one should have to hear themselves this much,\" says 26-year-old Andrea. \"It's unnatural.\" She has been famous since she was 16 and seems to be the Corr who is most uneasy with the unwavering gaze of the media and the star-struck public. \"It tampers with your self-perception,\" she says, rummaging in her make-up bag. \"You become like a caricature of yourself. I sometimes feel like the image of me is taking over, that the real me is only glimpsed... Then again, all this\" - she nods towards the lights and cameras, the rail of designer clothes - \"is our reality now. Our virtual reality, anyway.\" </p> <p>Reality for the Corrs is now as far as is possible from the small-town life they once led in Dundalk, County Louth. The only constant is pop music, which has been a presence in their lives from as far back as they can remember. \"Mammy and Daddy were total pop fans,\" recalls Andrea fondly. \"The radio was on in the house all the time. I would have to sit by the tape recorder while Mammy was making the dinner, and as soon as she heard a song she needed to learn, I'd have to leap up and press the record button. That was my job. It was like pop music united us all.\" </p> <p>Jerry Corr, whose day job was a wages supervisor in a local bank, and his wife, Jean, played the pubs and hotels of County Louth and beyond in the 70s and 80s, as a duo called Sound Affair. They specialised in pop covers and that weird hybrid known as Country &amp; Irish. Jerry played Farfisa organ, Jean sang; sometimes, Jim sat in on their sets with his guitar. Back then, Dundalk was a small Irish town with a big, bad reputation. Just 11 miles from the border with Northern Ireland and close to the \"bandit country\" of south Armagh, it became a haven for IRA fugitives on the run from the Troubles in the north. </p> <p>A soft-spoken, guarded and quietly humorous man, Jerry is catching up with his offspring before they depart on a global touring and promotional schedule that stretches ahead for six months, culminating in six Christmas shows at Wembley Arena. He regales me with tales of his own gigging days, when, as he diplomatically puts it, \"You had to gauge your audience's temperament in a way that you wouldn't have to do elsewhere. </p> <p>\"I remember playing pubs where we'd have to throw in Four Green Fields or even The Boys Of The Old Brigade. You simply had to do it. Once, we played a traditional Irish song called Faine Gael An Lae [Bright Ring Of Day], and suddenly I was looking out at all these fellas standing to attention in the pub. It had been adopted, unbeknownst to us, as some sort of IRA anthem. Other times, it would just be drunks getting messy, but there's a few places you could visit today and I could show you the skidmarks we made when we were leaving.\" </p> <p>The Corr children were encouraged to play music almost as a matter of course. \"I never remember any parental pressure,\" says Andrea. \"We all just drifted into it in different ways.\" Initially, Jim and Sharon were the most serious, the former attending the Irish Academy of Music, the latter playing violin with the Junior Irish Youth Orchestra. At home, though, they played pop: \"It's funny,\" says Andrea, \"but we all kind of liked the same stuff - anything with a strong melody, really. For me, Prince was it! I didn't really understand a lot of his lyrics at the time, until Daddy confiscated the Lovesexy album, the one where he's naked on the front.\" </p> <p>By the late 80s, Jim Corr was a jobbing musician, playing in a local band called Cry (\"sort of Echo &amp; The Bunnymen meets the Police\") doing session work for various Irish acts, and thinking that he might be better off pursuing a career in electronics. \"For a while, myself and Sharon played the pubs, just like Mammy and Daddy did. We'd cover Mary Black songs and Horslips tunes, and I got this idea that we could make melodic pop that brought in elements of Irish traditional music. It seemed quite natural, really.\" </p> <p>Until then, the fledgling Corrs had been a bedroom synth-pop band, playing \"real early-80s stuff\", with titles such as Dance To The Beat. Even then, they were focused, driven. \"It's funny,\" says Caroline, \"but we always had this naive belief that we were going to make it. It was sort of unspoken, but it was there from the start. We worked and worked until we had this funny confidence. I mean, think about it, we sat down and wrote everything ourselves, never covered other people's stuff. We just thought if we were good enough to make it at all, we could make it on our own terms.\" </p> <p>It was Jim who suggested that the group should audition for the role of the band in Alan Parker's film of Roddy Doyle's book, The Commitments, back in 1990. They didn't get the job, but in the audience was John Hughes, who was employed as musical co-ordinator for the film. \"I just saw something that night in their performance, something intangible but incredibly strong, that made me want to manage them.\" </p> <p>It is obvious that in John Hughes, a former professional musician, the Corrs have met their perfect mentor. \"We had all the usual parental reservations about the music business,\" says Jerry Corr. \"In fact, Jean would have preferred Andrea to go to university. But as soon as John got involved, we knew they were in safe hands.\" And so it has been ever since. </p> <p>Today, the group dynamic seems to have fused effortlessly with the family dynamic. At one time, things were more tempestuous. \"Right now, I don't feel I have to be a member of the Corrs every day of my life,\" says Sharon, \" but early on it was difficult to get that space. The family thing was frustrating. I think we all felt that to varying degrees. It was like we all had to be motivated in one direction - I mean, we still are - but then it was without any real allowance for individual personalities or conflicting opinions. Plus, there were the usual family rows.\" How bad did it get? \"Oh, it was bad, all right. Mad rows. All the time. See, the one frustrating thing about a family, any family, is that you can often get pigeon-holed at an early age - people look at you the way you were when you were an adolescent brat, for instance. You get stereotyped, and the stereotype tends to stick.\" </p> <p>So what was your stereotype? \"I suppose I was thought of as being dogmatic and really very opinionated. I mean, as an adolescent, I really was. I thought I knew it all. So, I got a hard time for that for ages. It doesn't happen any more. We get on pretty well now, considering.\" Interestingly, despite the familial tensions, the group has never come close to splitting. To waste their talent, says Sharon, without irony, \"would be like blasphemy\". </p> <p>Last October, the Corrs' virtual-reality world was shattered with a cruel suddenness. Their mother was admitted to hospital with a suspected lung infection. She died a week later, aged 57. \"I was emotionally wrecked after making the album,\" says Andrea. \"The way it was in my head was that we started an album, then our mother died, then we finished the album and our mother's still dead... that's hard... I mean, I don't think we could have done it any other way. She wanted us to keep going, to keep getting better. We have to celebrate that in our music.\" </p> <p>Did Andrea have any regrets about not going to university, I wondered, thinking how different her life would have been had she done so: how she would never have had to grapple with a loss of the self, except theoretically; how she could have gone blissfully through another calmer, slower life, never having to face down the constant dazzling reflection of her other, increasingly unreal, celebrity self. She thinks about her answer for all of a split second, then, grinning, but only half joking, says, \"I was going to study drama, something in the humanities, but sure I've learned more about drama and more about humanity in the Corrs than I ever could have anywhere else.\" Then, she puts on her make-up, walks into the glare of the photographer's lights, and merges effortlessly with her image.</p>",

'I am friends with Roman Catholics but...' 'What if it was one of the Corrs?' Silence. Shakes his head in bemusement. 'Okay, what if it was all three of the Corrs?' Ali G interviewing George Patten, chief executive, Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland All three Corr sisters sweep into the room together, a blur of flowing fabrics, pale skin and black tresses. Even this early in the morning, pre-styling, pre-hair-and-make-up, they look unfeasibly fresh and fragrant, as if they have just stepped out of an Organics shampoo advert. They are also small, though not Kylie tiny, but small and well-turned-out. Just like the pop music they make. In the studio where we are gathered for a photo-shoot, they try on a succession of pants and tops, trading quips and one-liners, as only sisters do. The Corrs, it seems, are having fun with their fame. You cannot imagine their names attached to headlines concerning mysteriously cancelled shows or dead-of-night admissions to the Priory. They are too no-nonsense Irish, too grounded, too un-neurotic. Neither, though, are they as squeaky-clean as their carefully modulated image might suggest. They could \"drink the Gallagher brothers under the table\", I was told. And their live shows, while never coming close to the Dionysian ideal, do rock, after a fashion. Bono, of U2, recalls attending a performance in Dublin last year: \"They came out, plugged in, and it was Bam ! The volume! I'd been to see Garbage the night before and, believe me, Garbage are a loud band. I mean really loud. But the Corrs were louder.\" The Corrs are shadowed by some more disturbing pop precedents: the whole twisted history of the family-that-plays-together, from the Partridge Family to the Osmonds, from the Carpenters to the Jacksons and even the Gallaghers. Here, we pop-watchers assume, lies dysfunction: dear dead Karen Carpenter, poor weird Michael Jackson, not to mention the spiralling, very public sibling rivalry that is the ongoing Noel and Liam show. Then, of course, there's also the spectre of the Irish musical family, that all-grinning, all-singing lineage that stretches back to the 60s (which, in Ireland, lest we forget, were never even remotely \"swinging\") and the three brothers who called themselves the Bachelors (what manner of latent, quintessentially Irish longings/denials lay beneath that name), and, in the 80s, that gaggle of lip-glossed glam-girls, the Nolan sisters. What dark well of familial secrets lurks beneath that relentlessly happy-go-lucky, rinky-dinky, we-are-family professionalism? It's no use asking the Corrs, I fear. They don't seem to fit into either camp. That said, there is an undeniable - there's no other word for it - niceness about them and their music. It is not tiresomely-wholesome Dana niceness, nor even smug Ronan-from-Boyzone niceness, both of which, you suspect, conceal a heart of steel and an ambition that began as over-vaulting and grew: Dana ran for president of Ireland, while Ronan recently admitted, without irony, that he might one day do the same. It is, though, a peculiarly Irish niceness. A professional niceness that is eager to please, unremittingly polite, and practised with an unstated understanding that you are not just letting yourself down if you misbehave, but also your town, your country and, of course, your family. These traditional values still hold fast in the new Ireland, much more so than they do in Blairite, post-Thatcher Britain. Why else does the Eurovision Song Contest remain such an obsession and a source of pride in Ireland whereas everywhere else it has long since passed into post-ironic campness? Though the Corrs are part of the new, confident, supposedly European Ireland that grew up in tandem with U2's global ascendancy, they also straddle the enduring, traditional Ireland. You could link their extraordinary global success to the post-Riverdance marketing of a kind of faux-Irish pop heritage, but their roots, musically at least, defy such a pat explanation. They did not grow up playing Irish traditional music in sessions and festivals: they began life as a late-80s synthesiser-pop band, all four playing keyboards over programmed beats. Their shared influences were Prince, the Police, Nick Kershaw and, naturally, U2. You can, if you listen closely, hear all of these influences in their shiny, bright pop, just as you will look in vain for angst \u00e0 la Sinead O'Connor or Pogues-type pandemonium. The Corrs may incorporate elements of Irish traditionalism into their set, but they do not play it with the conviction that attends their own sleekly modern take on traditional pop, which is where their strength and durability lies. Their antecedents are Abba and the Carpenters, and even Blondie, not the angst merchants that I depend on to reflect and assuage my dark confusions. Not being a Corrs fan before meeting them, I listen to their entire recorded output, the way I would normally listen to a new Radiohead or Neil Young album. What I hear is crafted, somewhat airbrushed, melodic pop, which at times subtly utilises elements of Irish traditional playing. I am not fired up by their songs but I am surprised more than once - mostly by the grain of Andrea Corr's voice, which was recently described by their current producer, the wonderfully named Mutt Lange, \"as the best pop voice in the world right now\". For me, it was more the undertow of plaintive sadness that surfaces from time to time, like a kink in a beautifully woven piece of fabric. Listen to how she phrases the line \"no more waiting, no more aching\" on What Can I Do: that perfectly pitched pause before she lights on and stretches the last two syllables into a suggestion of pure regret. Then imagine what Burt Bacharach could do with a voice like that. In the flesh, as on stage and in camera, Andrea looks the sultriest Corr, even - especially - when, knees tucked under her chin, she starts to suck her thumb, lost in some private reverie. She is the child of the family, the one who began singing with the band when she was still at school, the one whose flirtatious gaze has graced numerous magazine covers; she is the one whom the tabloids seek out, linking her to a succession of ever more unlikely young men, the most recent being Robbie Williams - \"Do you think it's physically possible,\" she protests, \"to go out with all those guys that the press have said?\" Behind the pout, though, there is a brain. Her favourite book is Dostoyevsky's Crime And Punishment: \"I'm just drawn to the insight into the psychology of the mind, the conflicts about what's morally right. It's the head stuff I like.\" Sharon, 28, the eldest sister, is altogether more poised, elegant even. You can't imagine her sucking her thumb. Sharon plays the violin, is classically trained, and may succeed in making that unlikely pop instrument as sexy as the guitar. She is \"in a long-term relationship\" and spends a lot of time in her fianc\u00e9's home town, Belfast, where \"the people are lovely and you don't get hassled so much\". Caroline, the middle sister, has been described as the tomboy of the group, perhaps because she is the drummer. Tomboy or not, she has that practical, no-nonsense approach characteristic of those who make their living hitting skins with sticks. She wolfs down three bacon sandwiches before the photo-shoot. She seems bemused but unfazed by the turn her life has taken: \"For a long time, I had no idea what we were doing,\" she laughs. \"I was a teenager and it was all a bit of a laugh. Looking back, I still can't believe the cheek of us.\" Brother Jim seems more reserved than his sisters. In the words of a recent pop magazine profile, he exudes \"the stoical air of a guy used to waiting his turn in the bathroom\".

It was like pop music united us all.\" Jerry Corr, whose day job was a wages supervisor in a local bank, and his wife, Jean, played the pubs and hotels of County Louth and beyond in the 70s and 80s, as a duo called Sound Affair. They specialised in pop covers and that weird hybrid known as Country &amp; Irish. Jerry played Farfisa organ, Jean sang; sometimes, Jim sat in on their sets with his guitar. Back then, Dundalk was a small Irish town with a big, bad reputation. Just 11 miles from the border with Northern Ireland and close to the \"bandit country\" of south Armagh, it became a haven for IRA fugitives on the run from the Troubles in the north. A soft-spoken, guarded and quietly humorous man, Jerry is catching up with his offspring before they depart on a global touring and promotional schedule that stretches ahead for six months, culminating in six Christmas shows at Wembley Arena. He regales me with tales of his own gigging days, when, as he diplomatically puts it, \"You had to gauge your audience's temperament in a way that you wouldn't have to do elsewhere. \"I remember playing pubs where we'd have to throw in Four Green Fields or even The Boys Of The Old Brigade. You simply had to do it. Once, we played a traditional Irish song called Faine Gael An Lae [Bright Ring Of Day], and suddenly I was looking out at all these fellas standing to attention in the pub. It had been adopted, unbeknownst to us, as some sort of IRA anthem. Other times, it would just be drunks getting messy, but there's a few places you could visit today and I could show you the skidmarks we made when we were leaving.\" The Corr children were encouraged to play music almost as a matter of course. \"I never remember any parental pressure,\" says Andrea. \"We all just drifted into it in different ways.\" Initially, Jim and Sharon were the most serious, the former attending the Irish Academy of Music, the latter playing violin with the Junior Irish Youth Orchestra. At home, though, they played pop: \"It's funny,\" says Andrea, \"but we all kind of liked the same stuff - anything with a strong melody, really. For me, Prince was it! I didn't really understand a lot of his lyrics at the time, until Daddy confiscated the Lovesexy album, the one where he's naked on the front.\" By the late 80s, Jim Corr was a jobbing musician, playing in a local band called Cry (\"sort of Echo &amp; The Bunnymen meets the Police\") doing session work for various Irish acts, and thinking that he might be better off pursuing a career in electronics. \"For a while, myself and Sharon played the pubs, just like Mammy and Daddy did. We'd cover Mary Black songs and Horslips tunes, and I got this idea that we could make melodic pop that brought in elements of Irish traditional music. It seemed quite natural, really.\" Until then, the fledgling Corrs had been a bedroom synth-pop band, playing \"real early-80s stuff\", with titles such as Dance To The Beat. Even then, they were focused, driven. \"It's funny,\" says Caroline, \"but we always had this naive belief that we were going to make it. It was sort of unspoken, but it was there from the start. We worked and worked until we had this funny confidence. I mean, think about it, we sat down and wrote everything ourselves, never covered other people's stuff. We just thought if we were good enough to make it at all, we could make it on our own terms.\" It was Jim who suggested that the group should audition for the role of the band in Alan Parker's film of Roddy Doyle's book, The Commitments, back in 1990. They didn't get the job, but in the audience was John Hughes, who was employed as musical co-ordinator for the film. \"I just saw something that night in their performance, something intangible but incredibly strong, that made me want to manage them.\" It is obvious that in John Hughes, a former professional musician, the Corrs have met their perfect mentor. \"We had all the usual parental reservations about the music business,\" says Jerry Corr. \"In fact, Jean would have preferred Andrea to go to university. But as soon as John got involved, we knew they were in safe hands.\" And so it has been ever since. Today, the group dynamic seems to have fused effortlessly with the family dynamic. At one time, things were more tempestuous. \"Right now, I don't feel I have to be a member of the Corrs every day of my life,\" says Sharon, \" but early on it was difficult to get that space. The family thing was frustrating. I think we all felt that to varying degrees. It was like we all had to be motivated in one direction - I mean, we still are - but then it was without any real allowance for individual personalities or conflicting opinions. Plus, there were the usual family rows.\" How bad did it get? \"Oh, it was bad, all right. Mad rows. All the time. See, the one frustrating thing about a family, any family, is that you can often get pigeon-holed at an early age - people look at you the way you were when you were an adolescent brat, for instance. You get stereotyped, and the stereotype tends to stick.\" So what was your stereotype? \"I suppose I was thought of as being dogmatic and really very opinionated. I mean, as an adolescent, I really was. I thought I knew it all. So, I got a hard time for that for ages. It doesn't happen any more. We get on pretty well now, considering.\" Interestingly, despite the familial tensions, the group has never come close to splitting. To waste their talent, says Sharon, without irony, \"would be like blasphemy\". Last October, the Corrs' virtual-reality world was shattered with a cruel suddenness. Their mother was admitted to hospital with a suspected lung infection. She died a week later, aged 57. \"I was emotionally wrecked after making the album,\" says Andrea. \"The way it was in my head was that we started an album, then our mother died, then we finished the album and our mother's still dead... that's hard... I mean, I don't think we could have done it any other way. She wanted us to keep going, to keep getting better. We have to celebrate that in our music.\" Did Andrea have any regrets about not going to university, I wondered, thinking how different her life would have been had she done so: how she would never have had to grapple with a loss of the self, except theoretically; how she could have gone blissfully through another calmer, slower life, never having to face down the constant dazzling reflection of her other, increasingly unreal, celebrity self. She thinks about her answer for all of a split second, then, grinning, but only half joking, says, \"I was going to study drama, something in the humanities, but sure I've learned more about drama and more about humanity in the Corrs than I ever could have anywhere else.\" Then, she puts on her make-up, walks into the glare of the photographer's lights, and merges effortlessly with her image.",

      "body": "<p>Dr Jo Lines leans his bare white arm lightly on the fine net that forms the roof and walls of the cage. Within seconds, about 20 of the creatures inside have latched on to him and were sucking his blood. </p> <p>\"Try it,\" urges Lines, senior lecturer in vector biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"It's only a bit uncomfortable.\" Lines is obligingly providing a blood meal for a cluster of female mosquitoes of the variety Anopheles, the one that carries the parasite Plasmodium falciparum , which is responsible for malaria.</p> <p>These particular specimens, living in their cage in a hot, low-ceilinged cellar under Gower Street in central London, are certified malaria-free; but it was their infected cousins that last month slid their needle-sharp probosces through the skin of British troops stationed in Sierra Leone, allowing the parasite lurking in their salivary glands to slip into the soldiers' bloodstream and induce the potentially lethal fever of malaria.</p> <p>Every year, 500 million people in tropical countries develop malaria; one million of them, mostly children under the age of five, die as a result. In some areas, P. falciparum 's resistance to multiple drugs is growing so fast that even if you can afford treatment, it may not work. But, just because the number of cases in this country is still comparatively few, we would do well not to be complacent. Malaria has shrugged off everything our modern medical arsenal can throw at it, and, after a brief retreat just after the second world war, is on the march again.</p> <p>More than 2,000 travellers return from infested areas to the UK every year infected with malaria, and the number is rising. The disease, which may well have infected the dinosaurs, kills more people worldwide than Aids. The people who arrive home are the lucky ones: get to the doctor in time, and fast, effective treatment is available. Without a course of drugs, however, you can feel as though a mild flu is coming on at midday and be dead from inflammation of the brain by midnight.</p> <p>A plausible scenario, sketched for me by Dr Lines, suggests that it would take a rise in our average minimum temperature of only a few tenths of a degree - quite possible, given global warming - for malaria-carrying mosquitoes to be once again capable of infecting people in the south of England. Lines has been tending mosquitoes for more than 20 years - not that you can become too attached to your subjects, seeing as they live only for about two weeks - yet he is still affected by the saliva they inject when they \"bite\". \"If I flare up immediately,\" he says, \"that means I won't have trouble later.\" He removes his arm and gazes calmly at his unmarked skin. \"I'll be itching like hell tonight.\"</p> <p>So, why do some people get attacked by every mozzie in the neighbourhood while others can sleep through the night unmarked? \"We know they are attracted to moisture, carbon dioxide, lactic acid and warmth,\" he says, \"but we don't know why some people are much more attractive than others.\"</p> <p>References to malaria-type fevers date back to the ancient Greeks - the historian Herodotus mentions that fishermen used to sleep under their nets for protection. Treatments up until the 19th century were drastic and largely ineffective. Purging and bleeding were used for malaria, as for almost everything else. More specific and imaginative remedies included: eating live spiders on a pat of butter; embracing a bald-headed Brahmin widow at dawn; and placing a copy of the fourth book of the Iliad under the patient's head.</p> <p>The first recorded western use of the one really effective remedy - the bark of the cinchona tree, first found in what is now Equador - is around 1630. Experts now generally agree that the deadly form of malaria, carried by the Anopheles mosquito, was actually brought to the Americas by the slave trade, another gift from the west, along with smallpox. Traditional healers probably tried the bark because it was effective against other fevers. French chemists extracted quinine, the active alkaloid in cinchona, in 1820.</p> <p>For a long time, cinchona bark was associated with the Jesuits and regarded with suspicion. Oliver Cromwell, who died of malaria, might have been saved by the new treatment, but his doctors did not dare prescribe the Popish Powder. For more than 200 years, debate raged over how effective it was, many doctors continuing to recommend bleeding, purging and worse. The 18th-century British surgeon, James Lind - better known for his advocacy of lemons to combat scurvy - also supported the use of bark for sailors, and made up a recipe of bark, orange peel and alcohol that cut malaria cases in the navy.</p> <p>Despite the effectiveness of quinine, during Victorian times more than 30% of hospital beds in the British colonies were filled with malaria cases, and malaria was still killing hundreds of thousands in Europe alone at the beginning of the last century. More than 100,000 British soldiers, and the same number of Germans, contracted malaria in the Balkans between 1916 and 1917. It was not eradicated from Rome until as recently as the 30s, when Mussolini drained the Pontine Marshes.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the disease has been a menace to man for so long, there is still a lot that the experts don't know about malaria. What they do know is remarkable enough. Malaria, or rather P. falciparum , which infects both humans and mosquitoes, is such a fearsome adversary partly because of its protean life-cycle, which makes it seem like some mythical beast. The \"thing\" in the movie Alien shocked audiences when it burst out of its original pod in one form and then destroyed poor John Hurt's stomach when incarnated in another. This Plasmodium goes through no fewer than five such transformations in its brief life.</p> <p>You'll first encounter it during what's known as the sporozoite stage, when you are bitten by an infected mosquito and the parasite is injected into your bloodstream, along with the insect's saliva. There may be only a half-a-dozen individual parasites in your blood at this stage. Like special-forces troops, these parasites then have to evade not only your immune system, but must also rendezvous at your liver, where they hole up, the first stage of their mission completed.</p> <p>For about 10 days, you remain quite unaware that anything is happening. But the sporozoites are engaged in a frenzy of activity. Not only are they changing into their next stage, but each member of the original team is multiplying by a factor of 10,000. Then, just short of 10 days - the time it takes your second line of immune defence, the T-cells, fully to mount a counter attack - they burst from the liver and back into the bloodstream. But now they have become what are known as the merozoites: within minutes, each one invades a red blood cell and, once inside, begins to break down the iron-rich molecule of haemoglobin inside for food while starting to multiply yet again. This is when you start to notice that something is wrong.</p> <p>A classic sign of malaria is a fever that comes on every two or three days. That's how long it takes for each merozoite to multiply up to 20 times. So, by this point, even if only a single sporozoite had successfully made it to your liver in the first stage of infection, some 200,000 merozoites would now be infecting your blood cells and taking a chemical wrecking ball to their insides. Merozoites have a voracious appetite: in just a few hours, they can suck as much as a quarter of a pound of haemoglobin out of the red blood cells of an infected human. This is why those who are chronically infected with malaria suffer from anaemia, with all the associated lethargy and vulnerability to infection.</p> <p>Normally, when red blood cells are infected, it is the job of the spleen to spot that something is wrong and destroy them. But the merozoites have evolved a cunning plan to prevent this. They make the blood cells grow little protrusions so they become stuck in narrow blood vessels and capillaries, especially in the brain. That way, they never get to the spleen. Instead, lodged in some arterial backwater, they wait, brood pouches for Plasmodium , while enzymes leach out their iron. Then the merozoites breach the walls of the blood cells and pour out, leaving the cells' dying hulks behind.</p> <p>The damaging effect of malaria is due partly to a lack of oxygen. The clustering of cells stuck in the capillaries has an effect similar to that of the blocked blood vessels caused by a stroke, and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain drops off. The latest scientific thinking, however, is that some other as yet poorly-understood metabolic changes also take place, and that these are responsible for many of the symptoms - the reasoning behind this assumption is that a stroke causes irreversible brain damage, but someone who is sinking into a malarial coma can walk out of hospital within a few hours of taking drugs that target the merozoites.</p> <p>P. falciparum has not by any means finished its quick-change routine at this stage. So far, it has been operating by basic cell division, much like a bacterium or virus. Now it is ready for sex. Merozoites in a few of the infected blood vessels, instead of churning out copies of themselves, divide into a male and a female version, known as gametocytes.</p> <p>Once again, just how they decide to change is not clear. We know, however, that they indulge in some fancy footwork over sex ratios: to begin with, there are significantly more males than females; later on, the proportion evens up. Actually, the term male and female is a bit of a loose description - the females are essentially large eggs, while the males are not much more than sperm.</p> <p>The stage is now set for the final part of the cycle - the Plasmodium 's mission is accomplished, and it is time to ship out. Your bloodstream is by now packed with millions - if not billions - of infected cells, some of which contain the crucial gametocytes, the ones that are going to start the whole cycle all over again. If you live in a mosquito- infested area, you are likely to be bitten regularly, so when the next female mosquito sucks the blood from you that she needs to fertilise her eggs, some of the red corpuscles she ingests will contain gametocytes.</p> <p>Once the gametocytes are inside the mosquito's stomach, which is slightly cooler than their previous surroundings, they immediately recognise that they have successfully transferred and proceed to fuse to form zygotes. If you've only been infected by one set of sporozoites, then the mating of the gametocytes won't create any genetic variation, but if, as is more than likely in the Tropics, your original infection stemmed from the sporozoites of dozens or more mosquitoes, then this is where genes can be swapped and a resistance to drugs passed on. The zygotes then start dividing and produce - yes, you've guessed it - a new batch of sporozoites. We are nearly back at the beginning again. Relentlessly, these newly-hatched sporozoites will make their way through the dark tunnels of the mosquito's body and into the insect's salivary glands, where they will sit awaiting the next mission.</p> <p>The Plasmodium 's complicated life-cycle is both the key to its success and the root of its vulnerability. Some researchers are confident that the huge range of targets which this variety of manifestations offers means they will soon be able to deliver a knock-out blow. All the sophisticated techniques of modern molecular medicine are being pressed into service. Hit it with antibodies when it first arrives, jack up the T-cell response to mount an attack in the liver, tinker with the proteins it needs to bore its way into the blood cells, prevent production of the enzymes used to break up the haemoglobin, disrupt the sex ratio so only male or only female gametes are produced: variations on each of these methods are currently being researched in laboratories around the world.</p> <p>\"Malaria is a preventable disease,\" argues Professor Adrian Hill, of the Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford. \"It's a scandal that millions die from it every year. Money is at the root of the problem. The people who suffer most from malaria have little or no money.\" Hill is currently attempting to develop a vaccine, and that takes money. \"The total budget worldwide for research on a malaria vaccine is about $20 million,\" he explains. \"Compare that with $40 million for an Aids vaccine, and many times that for specific western diseases. A proper budget of $500 million a year could produce a really effective vaccine within a few years.\"</p> <p>Hill's vaccine approach is probably the most advanced in the world. It uses a combination of fragments from the parasite's DNA, which identify the proteins it exhibits at the liver stage, and a more traditional vaccine that was originally used against smallpox. \"DNA vaccines were the next big thing about five years ago,\" he says. \"They work brilliantly in mice, but they've been disappointing in humans. But combining them with a viral vaccine seems to boost their effect, and the early trials are looking good.\"</p> <p>Others in the field are not so sure that such vaccines are going to be the answer. Professor Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is considerably more cautious. \"There are enormous problems with getting the immune system to fight off malaria,\" she explains. \"We still don't really know which immune responses are important. I wouldn't expect to see an effective vaccine for 10 or 15 years, if then. So far, there hasn't been a single useful vaccine against any human parasitic disease.\"</p> <p>In fact, that last statement is not entirely true. There is a way that you could be vaccinated against malaria today that would give you protection for about six months with no need to take any drugs or preventatives. The only problem is that it is a technique that no one, except the most dedicated researcher, would be prepared to use - all you have to do is irradiate a large number of mosquitoes that are infected with P. falciparum by bombarding them with X-rays, then do a large-scale version of Dr Line's trick for real and put your arm in their cage and allow at least 1,000 of them to bite you.</p> <p>One of the few people in the world who does expose himself to this particular form of torture is Dr Stephen Hoffman, of the US Naval Medical Research Institute, who has devoted years to the fight against the disease. His experience provides a cautionary tale for those who believe a vaccination is around the corner. More than 20 years ago, he was among the researchers who were jubilant to discover exactly why volunteers treated in this way became immune.</p> <p>Microscopic studies revealed that the sporozoites in their blood had lost their protective protein coat, which is why they were no longer able to infect their host. The road suddenly seemed open to create a vaccine. Isolate the protein (which was dubbed circumsporozoite, or CS), inject it and wait while the body created antibodies, because sporozoites without CS cannot invade the liver.</p> <p>It worked very well in mice, but 13 years ago the first highly-publicised trials with humans were a disaster. Seven of the eight vaccinated volunteers developed the disease when they were infected. CS still hasn't delivered a viable vaccine, although new versions are currently being tested. Similar high hopes were placed in a vaccine called SPf66, developed by a Colombian researcher, Dr Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, and based on a synthetic peptide that targets the blood stage. A few years ago, it, too, was hyped as the next big thing, and some reports claimed that ethnocentric western scientists were ignoring its potential. But it, too, has not lived up to its early promise: clinical trials in Africa and south-east Asia have shown little or no protective effect.</p> <p>But amid all this talk of yet more hi-tech molecular fixes, it is easy to forget that in this century malaria has been successfully eradicated from large areas of the world, largely as a by-product of prosperity. Drainage to reclaim agricultural land and the move to live in solid houses with glassed windows had the incidental effect of both reducing the mosquito population and keeping them away from people. The last cases of malaria in Britain were recorded in the 50s on the Isle of Sheppey. Until the 30s, malaria was endemic in large areas of the US, where hundreds of thousands of people were infected every year. Since then, however, rising living standards have almost completely banished it. (Last year, the death of just three people in New York from a mosquito-born virus called St Louis encephalitis triggered off a major public health scare.) Malaria is, more than anything, a disease of poverty.</p> <p>\"Humans are the only host for falciparum malaria,\" says Riley. \"Theoretically, if everyone in the world with malaria could be treated with effective drugs and then kept from being bitten again, it would die out.\" This is, of course, impossible, but it is the principle that lies behind most eradication programmes: drain the marshy areas where the Anopheles mosquito likes to breed, detect early anyone who has been infected, treat them with drugs and then keep them from being re-infected. \"One of the most effective means of prevention is very simple and very low-tech,\" says Riley. \"It is a bed net dipped in insecticide. If they were properly used in Africa, you could reduce childhood mortality by up to 40% for a cost of less than $15 dollars a head.\" This low-tech approach relies on using different techniques for different situations and cultures: \"Nets work in Africa, because the mosquitoes there feed at night. But in South America, they are not so effective, because the mosquitoes bite before people go to bed.\"</p> <p>Within the past 15 years, cases of malaria have been dramatically cut in the Hunan province in China - from nearly a million in 1985 to 68,500 by 1993 - without the introduction of any new wonder vaccines but through a combination of better drainage, insecticide-treated nets and the rapid treatment of cases with drugs and traditional medicines, such as Qinghaosu, or sweet wormwood. Of course, results such as that assume a well-established and funded public health service, which is rarely available in most of Africa.</p> <p>But such pedestrian solutions tend not to grab the headlines. Far more exciting are the technological fixes, such as the proposal, reported earlier this year, to treat malaria patients in large trucks, where they would be exposed to oscillating magnetic fields. Professor Henry Lai, of the bioengineering department at the University of Washington, believes that the electromagnetic approach might succeed where chemicals have been failing. The key to this radical approach is that the remains of haemoglobin molecules, attacked by merozoites and bound into long stacks like \"tiny magnetic bars\", would be destabilised. He has found that the merozoite count was significantly reduced when blood samples were put into weak oscillating magnetic fields. The theory is that these fields cause the stacks to spin, damaging or even killing the parasites.</p> <p>Last month, however, it was fluorescent green mosquitoes that were being heralded as the key to \"eliminating this deadly disease\": researchers at Imperial College, London, reported that they had succeeded, for the first time, in genetically engineering a mosquito - they were green because the test gene the researchers inserted was one that causes fluorescence, to make the insect easier to spot when the experiment had worked. The idea is to create swarms of transgenic mosquitoes that have been engineered for sterility or resistance to P. falciparum , and then release them into the wild, where they can wreak havoc on the indigenous mosquitoes' ability to procreate or pass on their resistance. But the success of any such project depends on the very basic evolutionary principle that, if these transgenic mosquitoes are successfully to pass on their modified genes, they must either out-compete their rivals in the wild or be irresistibly sexually attractive. Such traits are a lot harder to insert than a bright green colouring.</p> <p>In fact, an evolutionary approach is the key to perhaps the most radical approach to malaria control of all. What both hi- and low-tech methods have in common is that they all involve waging war on P.falciparum . It is a pest, a parasite, to be fought, defeated, eradicated, disabled. But suppose you could cultivate it so that it became milder? Instead of regarding P. falciparum as some implacable enemy, how about treating it like another creature to be domesticated, such as sheep or horses? Sounds ridiculous?</p> <p>\"Imagine that you are a rhinovirus, the sort that causes colds,\" says Professor Paul Ewald, a biologist at Amherst College, Massachusetts. \"You want to infect people, but you want them to be able to move about and infect other people. So you are successful if you stay relatively mild. But if you are transmitted by an insect, say a mosquito, then it doesn't matter if your host is moving about or not. That's why diseases such as yellow fever and sleeping sickness are so much more virulent than others. The most successful infectious agents are those that replicate rapidly and get passed on fast.\"</p> <p>The essence of Ewald's idea is that if you can create conditions that make transmission harder, then the strains of the disease that are most successful will be the milder ones, which allow the host to move about and survive longer. One study that supports his view involves cholera, an infection carried via faeces in water - the more contaminated the water (ie, the easier it is for the cholera to be passed on), the more virulent the strains should be. Ewald's research in South America showed just that: heavily contaminated water in Guatemala was linked with a particularly vicious strain of cholera, while in Chile, where the water is much purer, the cholera is far milder. \"The most preventative form of medicine,\" he says, \"is when you change the organism so that it doesn't make you sick.\"</p> <p>Applying this approach to malaria, Ewald suggests that the key would be effective mosquito-proofing of houses. \"If the really sick, infected people are kept somewhere they can't be bitten, then the ones who are walking about will be the ones with a milder version,\" he explains. \"The selection pressures on P. falciparum will be to evolve into a milder strain.\" An evolutionary approach, he suggests, would also indicate that if you were developing a vaccine it should allow a mild version to persist so that people could build up natural immunity.</p> <p>Ewald's ideas are hardly mainstream yet, but he does have some supporters. \"If he is right, it may be that the application of an evolutionary theory to public health could save millions of lives,\" says Professor Joseph Schall of the University of Vermont. \"If we are able to manipulate the evolutionary trajectory of our friends - domestic animals and crops - why can we not do the same with our enemies such as cholera and malaria?\"</p> <p>The widespread incidence of the gene for sickle-cell anaemia in certain African populations where malaria is endemic shows that evolution in the human host is important as well. If you inherit one copy of this sickle-cell anaemia gene, it will modify your blood in such a way that merozoites find it more difficult to break down the haemoglobin; you would not be fully immune to malaria, but you will be less badly infected by the parasite. At a price: if you inherit two copies of the gene, one from each parent, you develop sickle-cell anaemia, a horrible disease that usually kills you in childhood. Yet the evolutionary trade-off between the risk of a lethal blood disease and partial protection against malaria turns out to be so beneficial that in some parts of Africa 25% of the population now has the sickle-cell gene.</p> <p>Medical historians estimate that P. falciparum has been using humans as a host ever since we developed agriculture, which gathered enough of us in one place to act as a reservoir. So, the history of malaria is essentially a mini-history of medicine. A hundred years ago, P. falciparum was treatable with a South American herbal medicine and vigorous public-health programmes. Today, with its genome nearly sequenced, we know infinitely more about its inner workings, but there are still areas of the world where all that is keeping it in check are public-health programmes and traditional herbs. P. falciparum is a parasite and a killer, but is also a powerful antidote to medical hubris</p> <p><strong> The war on malaria </strong></p> <p>Could malaria return to Britain? We already have Anopheles mosquitoes in this country, but they are not infected with malaria. According to Dr Ron Behrens of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, for malaria to become a risk here, 'first, you need some local anophelines to become infected by biting people who have come to the UK with malaria in their blood. What happens next depends on the temperature, which is why global warming could become a factor.' </p> <p>The warmer it is, the quicker the parasite develops. 'What's important is the minimum temperature,' says Behrens, 'but a small increase can have a big impact: a 0.2C increase in areas that were almost free of infection has increased the incidences of malaria from 1% to 5%.' </p> <p>There are increasing numbers of infected people in the UK; some do not even realise it and so have not sought treatment. If one of them was bitten in a hot summer, however, the cycle could start: 'Malaria is so dangerous because you have to act fast,' says Behrens. 'If you haven't been away and get infected, no one is going to suspect malaria. You may think you just have flu, and then find yourself in a coma within hours.' </p> <p><strong> Why the drugs don't work</strong><br> </p> <p> A few years ago, almost no new drugs against malaria were in the pipeline because the pharmaceutical companies did not consider it a profitable-enough disease - although it affects millions worldwide, few can afford the pills.

      "bodyText": "Dr Jo Lines leans his bare white arm lightly on the fine net that forms the roof and walls of the cage. Within seconds, about 20 of the creatures inside have latched on to him and were sucking his blood. \"Try it,\" urges Lines, senior lecturer in vector biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"It's only a bit uncomfortable.\" Lines is obligingly providing a blood meal for a cluster of female mosquitoes of the variety Anopheles, the one that carries the parasite Plasmodium falciparum , which is responsible for malaria. These particular specimens, living in their cage in a hot, low-ceilinged cellar under Gower Street in central London, are certified malaria-free; but it was their infected cousins that last month slid their needle-sharp probosces through the skin of British troops stationed in Sierra Leone, allowing the parasite lurking in their salivary glands to slip into the soldiers' bloodstream and induce the potentially lethal fever of malaria. Every year, 500 million people in tropical countries develop malaria; one million of them, mostly children under the age of five, die as a result. In some areas, P. falciparum 's resistance to multiple drugs is growing so fast that even if you can afford treatment, it may not work. But, just because the number of cases in this country is still comparatively few, we would do well not to be complacent. Malaria has shrugged off everything our modern medical arsenal can throw at it, and, after a brief retreat just after the second world war, is on the march again. More than 2,000 travellers return from infested areas to the UK every year infected with malaria, and the number is rising. The disease, which may well have infected the dinosaurs, kills more people worldwide than Aids. The people who arrive home are the lucky ones: get to the doctor in time, and fast, effective treatment is available. Without a course of drugs, however, you can feel as though a mild flu is coming on at midday and be dead from inflammation of the brain by midnight. A plausible scenario, sketched for me by Dr Lines, suggests that it would take a rise in our average minimum temperature of only a few tenths of a degree - quite possible, given global warming - for malaria-carrying mosquitoes to be once again capable of infecting people in the south of England. Lines has been tending mosquitoes for more than 20 years - not that you can become too attached to your subjects, seeing as they live only for about two weeks - yet he is still affected by the saliva they inject when they \"bite\". \"If I flare up immediately,\" he says, \"that means I won't have trouble later.\" He removes his arm and gazes calmly at his unmarked skin. \"I'll be itching like hell tonight.\" So, why do some people get attacked by every mozzie in the neighbourhood while others can sleep through the night unmarked? \"We know they are attracted to moisture, carbon dioxide, lactic acid and warmth,\" he says, \"but we don't know why some people are much more attractive than others.\" References to malaria-type fevers date back to the ancient Greeks - the historian Herodotus mentions that fishermen used to sleep under their nets for protection. Treatments up until the 19th century were drastic and largely ineffective. Purging and bleeding were used for malaria, as for almost everything else. More specific and imaginative remedies included: eating live spiders on a pat of butter; embracing a bald-headed Brahmin widow at dawn; and placing a copy of the fourth book of the Iliad under the patient's head. The first recorded western use of the one really effective remedy - the bark of the cinchona tree, first found in what is now Equador - is around 1630. Experts now generally agree that the deadly form of malaria, carried by the Anopheles mosquito, was actually brought to the Americas by the slave trade, another gift from the west, along with smallpox. Traditional healers probably tried the bark because it was effective against other fevers. French chemists extracted quinine, the active alkaloid in cinchona, in 1820. For a long time, cinchona bark was associated with the Jesuits and regarded with suspicion. Oliver Cromwell, who died of malaria, might have been saved by the new treatment, but his doctors did not dare prescribe the Popish Powder. For more than 200 years, debate raged over how effective it was, many doctors continuing to recommend bleeding, purging and worse. The 18th-century British surgeon, James Lind - better known for his advocacy of lemons to combat scurvy - also supported the use of bark for sailors, and made up a recipe of bark, orange peel and alcohol that cut malaria cases in the navy. Despite the effectiveness of quinine, during Victorian times more than 30% of hospital beds in the British colonies were filled with malaria cases, and malaria was still killing hundreds of thousands in Europe alone at the beginning of the last century. More than 100,000 British soldiers, and the same number of Germans, contracted malaria in the Balkans between 1916 and 1917. It was not eradicated from Rome until as recently as the 30s, when Mussolini drained the Pontine Marshes. Despite the fact that the disease has been a menace to man for so long, there is still a lot that the experts don't know about malaria. What they do know is remarkable enough. Malaria, or rather P. falciparum , which infects both humans and mosquitoes, is such a fearsome adversary partly because of its protean life-cycle, which makes it seem like some mythical beast. The \"thing\" in the movie Alien shocked audiences when it burst out of its original pod in one form and then destroyed poor John Hurt's stomach when incarnated in another. This Plasmodium goes through no fewer than five such transformations in its brief life. You'll first encounter it during what's known as the sporozoite stage, when you are bitten by an infected mosquito and the parasite is injected into your bloodstream, along with the insect's saliva. There may be only a half-a-dozen individual parasites in your blood at this stage. Like special-forces troops, these parasites then have to evade not only your immune system, but must also rendezvous at your liver, where they hole up, the first stage of their mission completed. For about 10 days, you remain quite unaware that anything is happening. But the sporozoites are engaged in a frenzy of activity. Not only are they changing into their next stage, but each member of the original team is multiplying by a factor of 10,000. Then, just short of 10 days - the time it takes your second line of immune defence, the T-cells, fully to mount a counter attack - they burst from the liver and back into the bloodstream. But now they have become what are known as the merozoites: within minutes, each one invades a red blood cell and, once inside, begins to break down the iron-rich molecule of haemoglobin inside for food while starting to multiply yet again. This is when you start to notice that something is wrong. A classic sign of malaria is a fever that comes on every two or three days. That's how long it takes for each merozoite to multiply up to 20 times. So, by this point, even if only a single sporozoite had successfully made it to your liver in the first stage of infection, some 200,000 merozoites would now be infecting your blood cells and taking a chemical wrecking ball to their insides. Merozoites have a voracious appetite: in just a few hours, they can suck as much as a quarter of a pound of haemoglobin out of the red blood cells of an infected human. This is why those who are chronically infected with malaria suffer from anaemia, with all the associated lethargy and vulnerability to infection. Normally, when red blood cells are infected, it is the job of the spleen to spot that something is wrong and destroy them. But the merozoites have evolved a cunning plan to prevent this. They make the blood cells grow little protrusions so they become stuck in narrow blood vessels and capillaries, especially in the brain. That way, they never get to the spleen. Instead, lodged in some arterial backwater, they wait, brood pouches for Plasmodium , while enzymes leach out their iron. Then the merozoites breach the walls of the blood cells and pour out, leaving the cells' dying hulks behind. The damaging effect of malaria is due partly to a lack of oxygen. The clustering of cells stuck in the capillaries has an effect similar to that of the blocked blood vessels caused by a stroke, and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain drops off. The latest scientific thinking, however, is that some other as yet poorly-understood metabolic changes also take place, and that these are responsible for many of the symptoms - the reasoning behind this assumption is that a stroke causes irreversible brain damage, but someone who is sinking into a malarial coma can walk out of hospital within a few hours of taking drugs that target the merozoites. P. falciparum has not by any means finished its quick-change routine at this stage. So far, it has been operating by basic cell division, much like a bacterium or virus. Now it is ready for sex. Merozoites in a few of the infected blood vessels, instead of churning out copies of themselves, divide into a male and a female version, known as gametocytes. Once again, just how they decide to change is not clear. We know, however, that they indulge in some fancy footwork over sex ratios: to begin with, there are significantly more males than females; later on, the proportion evens up. Actually, the term male and female is a bit of a loose description - the females are essentially large eggs, while the males are not much more than sperm. The stage is now set for the final part of the cycle - the Plasmodium 's mission is accomplished, and it is time to ship out. Your bloodstream is by now packed with millions - if not billions - of infected cells, some of which contain the crucial gametocytes, the ones that are going to start the whole cycle all over again. If you live in a mosquito- infested area, you are likely to be bitten regularly, so when the next female mosquito sucks the blood from you that she needs to fertilise her eggs, some of the red corpuscles she ingests will contain gametocytes. Once the gametocytes are inside the mosquito's stomach, which is slightly cooler than their previous surroundings, they immediately recognise that they have successfully transferred and proceed to fuse to form zygotes. If you've only been infected by one set of sporozoites, then the mating of the gametocytes won't create any genetic variation, but if, as is more than likely in the Tropics, your original infection stemmed from the sporozoites of dozens or more mosquitoes, then this is where genes can be swapped and a resistance to drugs passed on. The zygotes then start dividing and produce - yes, you've guessed it - a new batch of sporozoites. We are nearly back at the beginning again. Relentlessly, these newly-hatched sporozoites will make their way through the dark tunnels of the mosquito's body and into the insect's salivary glands, where they will sit awaiting the next mission. The Plasmodium 's complicated life-cycle is both the key to its success and the root of its vulnerability. Some researchers are confident that the huge range of targets which this variety of manifestations offers means they will soon be able to deliver a knock-out blow. All the sophisticated techniques of modern molecular medicine are being pressed into service. Hit it with antibodies when it first arrives, jack up the T-cell response to mount an attack in the liver, tinker with the proteins it needs to bore its way into the blood cells, prevent production of the enzymes used to break up the haemoglobin, disrupt the sex ratio so only male or only female gametes are produced: variations on each of these methods are currently being researched in laboratories around the world. \"Malaria is a preventable disease,\" argues Professor Adrian Hill, of the Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford. \"It's a scandal that millions die from it every year. Money is at the root of the problem. The people who suffer most from malaria have little or no money.\" Hill is currently attempting to develop a vaccine, and that takes money. \"The total budget worldwide for research on a malaria vaccine is about $20 million,\" he explains. \"Compare that with $40 million for an Aids vaccine, and many times that for specific western diseases. A proper budget of $500 million a year could produce a really effective vaccine within a few years.\" Hill's vaccine approach is probably the most advanced in the world. It uses a combination of fragments from the parasite's DNA, which identify the proteins it exhibits at the liver stage, and a more traditional vaccine that was originally used against smallpox. \"DNA vaccines were the next big thing about five years ago,\" he says. \"They work brilliantly in mice, but they've been disappointing in humans. But combining them with a viral vaccine seems to boost their effect, and the early trials are looking good.\" Others in the field are not so sure that such vaccines are going to be the answer. Professor Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is considerably more cautious. \"There are enormous problems with getting the immune system to fight off malaria,\" she explains. \"We still don't really know which immune responses are important. I wouldn't expect to see an effective vaccine for 10 or 15 years, if then. So far, there hasn't been a single useful vaccine against any human parasitic disease.\" In fact, that last statement is not entirely true. There is a way that you could be vaccinated against malaria today that would give you protection for about six months with no need to take any drugs or preventatives. The only problem is that it is a technique that no one, except the most dedicated researcher, would be prepared to use - all you have to do is irradiate a large number of mosquitoes that are infected with P. falciparum by bombarding them with X-rays, then do a large-scale version of Dr Line's trick for real and put your arm in their cage and allow at least 1,000 of them to bite you. One of the few people in the world who does expose himself to this particular form of torture is Dr Stephen Hoffman, of the US Naval Medical Research Institute, who has devoted years to the fight against the disease. His experience provides a cautionary tale for those who believe a vaccination is around the corner. More than 20 years ago, he was among the researchers who were jubilant to discover exactly why volunteers treated in this way became immune. Microscopic studies revealed that the sporozoites in their blood had lost their protective protein coat, which is why they were no longer able to infect their host. The road suddenly seemed open to create a vaccine. Isolate the protein (which was dubbed circumsporozoite, or CS), inject it and wait while the body created antibodies, because sporozoites without CS cannot invade the liver. It worked very well in mice, but 13 years ago the first highly-publicised trials with humans were a disaster. Seven of the eight vaccinated volunteers developed the disease when they were infected. CS still hasn't delivered a viable vaccine, although new versions are currently being tested. Similar high hopes were placed in a vaccine called SPf66, developed by a Colombian researcher, Dr Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, and based on a synthetic peptide that targets the blood stage. A few years ago, it, too, was hyped as the next big thing, and some reports claimed that ethnocentric western scientists were ignoring its potential. But it, too, has not lived up to its early promise: clinical trials in Africa and south-east Asia have shown little or no protective effect. But amid all this talk of yet more hi-tech molecular fixes, it is easy to forget that in this century malaria has been successfully eradicated from large areas of the world, largely as a by-product of prosperity. Drainage to reclaim agricultural land and the move to live in solid houses with glassed windows had the incidental effect of both reducing the mosquito population and keeping them away from people. The last cases of malaria in Britain were recorded in the 50s on the Isle of Sheppey. Until the 30s, malaria was endemic in large areas of the US, where hundreds of thousands of people were infected every year. Since then, however, rising living standards have almost completely banished it. (Last year, the death of just three people in New York from a mosquito-born virus called St Louis encephalitis triggered off a major public health scare.) Malaria is, more than anything, a disease of poverty. \"Humans are the only host for falciparum malaria,\" says Riley. \"Theoretically, if everyone in the world with malaria could be treated with effective drugs and then kept from being bitten again, it would die out.\" This is, of course, impossible, but it is the principle that lies behind most eradication programmes: drain the marshy areas where the Anopheles mosquito likes to breed, detect early anyone who has been infected, treat them with drugs and then keep them from being re-infected. \"One of the most effective means of prevention is very simple and very low-tech,\" says Riley. \"It is a bed net dipped in insecticide. If they were properly used in Africa, you could reduce childhood mortality by up to 40% for a cost of less than $15 dollars a head.\" This low-tech approach relies on using different techniques for different situations and cultures: \"Nets work in Africa, because the mosquitoes there feed at night. But in South America, they are not so effective, because the mosquitoes bite before people go to bed.\" Within the past 15 years, cases of malaria have been dramatically cut in the Hunan province in China - from nearly a million in 1985 to 68,500 by 1993 - without the introduction of any new wonder vaccines but through a combination of better drainage, insecticide-treated nets and the rapid treatment of cases with drugs and traditional medicines, such as Qinghaosu, or sweet wormwood. Of course, results such as that assume a well-established and funded public health service, which is rarely available in most of Africa. But such pedestrian solutions tend not to grab the headlines. Far more exciting are the technological fixes, such as the proposal, reported earlier this year, to treat malaria patients in large trucks, where they would be exposed to oscillating magnetic fields. Professor Henry Lai, of the bioengineering department at the University of Washington, believes that the electromagnetic approach might succeed where chemicals have been failing. The key to this radical approach is that the remains of haemoglobin molecules, attacked by merozoites and bound into long stacks like \"tiny magnetic bars\", would be destabilised. He has found that the merozoite count was significantly reduced when blood samples were put into weak oscillating magnetic fields. The theory is that these fields cause the stacks to spin, damaging or even killing the parasites. Last month, however, it was fluorescent green mosquitoes that were being heralded as the key to \"eliminating this deadly disease\": researchers at Imperial College, London, reported that they had succeeded, for the first time, in genetically engineering a mosquito - they were green because the test gene the researchers inserted was one that causes fluorescence, to make the insect easier to spot when the experiment had worked. The idea is to create swarms of transgenic mosquitoes that have been engineered for sterility or resistance to P. falciparum , and then release them into the wild, where they can wreak havoc on the indigenous mosquitoes' ability to procreate or pass on their resistance. But the success of any such project depends on the very basic evolutionary principle that, if these transgenic mosquitoes are successfully to pass on their modified genes, they must either out-compete their rivals in the wild or be irresistibly sexually attractive. Such traits are a lot harder to insert than a bright green colouring. In fact, an evolutionary approach is the key to perhaps the most radical approach to malaria control of all. What both hi- and low-tech methods have in common is that they all involve waging war on P.falciparum . It is a pest, a parasite, to be fought, defeated, eradicated, disabled. But suppose you could cultivate it so that it became milder? Instead of regarding P. falciparum as some implacable enemy, how about treating it like another creature to be domesticated, such as sheep or horses? Sounds ridiculous? \"Imagine that you are a rhinovirus, the sort that causes colds,\" says Professor Paul Ewald, a biologist at Amherst College, Massachusetts. \"You want to infect people, but you want them to be able to move about and infect other people. So you are successful if you stay relatively mild. But if you are transmitted by an insect, say a mosquito, then it doesn't matter if your host is moving about or not. That's why diseases such as yellow fever and sleeping sickness are so much more virulent than others. The most successful infectious agents are those that replicate rapidly and get passed on fast.\" The essence of Ewald's idea is that if you can create conditions that make transmission harder, then the strains of the disease that are most successful will be the milder ones, which allow the host to move about and survive longer. One study that supports his view involves cholera, an infection carried via faeces in water - the more contaminated the water (ie, the easier it is for the cholera to be passed on), the more virulent the strains should be. Ewald's research in South America showed just that: heavily contaminated water in Guatemala was linked with a particularly vicious strain of cholera, while in Chile, where the water is much purer, the cholera is far milder. \"The most preventative form of medicine,\" he says, \"is when you change the organism so that it doesn't make you sick.\" Applying this approach to malaria, Ewald suggests that the key would be effective mosquito-proofing of houses. \"If the really sick, infected people are kept somewhere they can't be bitten, then the ones who are walking about will be the ones with a milder version,\" he explains. \"The selection pressures on P. falciparum will be to evolve into a milder strain.\" An evolutionary approach, he suggests, would also indicate that if you were developing a vaccine it should allow a mild version to persist so that people could build up natural immunity. Ewald's ideas are hardly mainstream yet, but he does have some supporters. \"If he is right, it may be that the application of an evolutionary theory to public health could save millions of lives,\" says Professor Joseph Schall of the University of Vermont. \"If we are able to manipulate the evolutionary trajectory of our friends - domestic animals and crops - why can we not do the same with our enemies such as cholera and malaria?\" The widespread incidence of the gene for sickle-cell anaemia in certain African populations where malaria is endemic shows that evolution in the human host is important as well. If you inherit one copy of this sickle-cell anaemia gene, it will modify your blood in such a way that merozoites find it more difficult to break down the haemoglobin; you would not be fully immune to malaria, but you will be less badly infected by the parasite. At a price: if you inherit two copies of the gene, one from each parent, you develop sickle-cell anaemia, a horrible disease that usually kills you in childhood. Yet the evolutionary trade-off between the risk of a lethal blood disease and partial protection against malaria turns out to be so beneficial that in some parts of Africa 25% of the population now has the sickle-cell gene. Medical historians estimate that P. falciparum has been using humans as a host ever since we developed agriculture, which gathered enough of us in one place to act as a reservoir. So, the history of malaria is essentially a mini-history of medicine. A hundred years ago, P. falciparum was treatable with a South American herbal medicine and vigorous public-health programmes. Today, with its genome nearly sequenced, we know infinitely more about its inner workings, but there are still areas of the world where all that is keeping it in check are public-health programmes and traditional herbs. P. falciparum is a parasite and a killer, but is also a powerful antidote to medical hubris The war on malaria Could malaria return to Britain? We already have Anopheles mosquitoes in this country, but they are not infected with malaria. According to Dr Ron Behrens of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, for malaria to become a risk here, 'first, you need some local anophelines to become infected by biting people who have come to the UK with malaria in their blood. What happens next depends on the temperature, which is why global warming could become a factor.' The warmer it is, the quicker the parasite develops. 'What's important is the minimum temperature,' says Behrens, 'but a small increase can have a big impact: a 0.2C increase in areas that were almost free of infection has increased the incidences of malaria from 1% to 5%.' There are increasing numbers of infected people in the UK; some do not even realise it and so have not sought treatment. If one of them was bitten in a hot summer, however, the cycle could start: 'Malaria is so dangerous because you have to act fast,' says Behrens. 'If you haven't been away and get infected, no one is going to suspect malaria. You may think you just have flu, and then find yourself in a coma within hours.' Why the drugs don't work A few years ago, almost no new drugs against malaria were in the pipeline because the pharmaceutical companies did not consider it a profitable-enough disease - although it affects millions worldwide, few can afford the pills. Recently, several large-scale projects have encouraged partnerships between research institutes and drug companies; these include The Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), sponsored to the tune of $50 million by Bill Gates, and the WHO's Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). The latest thinking appeals to industry and government self-interest by arguing that malaria holds up economic development. Resistance to the drugs is growing. The Thai-Cambodian border, for instance, is a region of enormous upheaval, where gem miners in search of rubies and emeralds try drug after drug in an attempt to stay on their feet long enough to make their fortune. The result has been the emergence of a strain of malaria that is resistant to all the registered anti-malaria drugs bar Artemisia, the traditional Chinese remedy based on sweet wormwood. In other areas, resistance is growing to some older drugs such as chloroquine and proguanil (discovered in the early 40s and sold here under the trade name Paludrine), although other combinations, such as Malarone (a combination of proguanil and atovaquone), are still effective. Quinine and its derivatives work by poisoning P. falciparum in its own waste, by preventing it from getting rid of one of the by-products of breaking-down haemoglobin. Artemisinin seems to work by increasing the action of damaging free radicals that attack the parasite. The gene in P. falciparum that has mutated to resist one anti-malarial drug also resists others of similar chemical structure. 'It's disturbing,' say researchers, 'that a mutation in just one gene can trash three or four drugs at once.' Advice for travellers If you are French and travelling to a malaria-infested area, you will be given Savarine which contains the familiar combination of chloroquine and proguanil, but in higher doses than are given here, and is taken daily rather than weekly. Some experts claim that this gives more constant protection. Savarine is hard to obtain in the UK. Mefloquine, also known as Lariam, was developed in the 80s and is based on quinine.

It's been, what? Two years? And you haven't let anyone else in.\" As if boyfriends were like Girl Scouts, going door to door, trying to look cute and move some product, which is actually not so far from the truth. \"I've been busy,\" I said. \"I just thought maybe I'd be signing books and I'd look up and he'd be standing there.\" My therapist rolled her eyes. \"Of course you'll fall back on what's familiar,\" she said. \"Of course you're going to resort to that.\" At the mention of \"resort\", I pictured my romantic life as a kind of family vacation spot where everyone else is water skiing and drinking beer and grilling on the barbecue.

      "body": "<p>Three scenes from London life. (1) Westminster in 1999, when the tidal wave of \"bogus asylum seekers\" that would break across tabloid front pages was just a gentle swell on the horizon. A House of Commons standing committee is discussing the government's proposal to replace welfare benefits (of around \u00a346 a week) with a system of food vouchers worth \u00a335 a week. \"Many asylum seekers come from communities where wealth may be stored in jewellery,\" explains the Home Office minister Mike O'Brien, \"and it is right for us to take account of that wealth.\" </p> <p>\"Is the minister suggesting,\" asks Diane Abbott, MP, \"that asylum seekers should sell their jewellery, perhaps their wedding rings, as an alternative to the government meeting its moral and international responsibilities to provide a reasonable level of support?\" </p> <p>When O'Brien replies: \"I certainly am suggesting that,\" a Tory backbencher is heard to mutter: \"You'll be wanting the gold fillings out of their teeth next.\" </p> <p>(2) The David Irving libel trial in February. Reading from the transcript of an interview with Irving on Australian television, Richard Rampton, QC, barrister for the defence, asks why Irving had said that the idea of black men playing cricket for England made him feel \"queasy\". </p> <p>Irving: \"My reply to him on air was, what a pity it is that we have to have blacks on the team and that they are better than our whites.\" </p> <p>Rampton: \"Why is that a pity?\" </p> <p>Irving: \"It is a pity because I am English.\" </p> <p>Rampton: \"Are they not English too?\" </p> <p>Irving: \"Well, English or British, are you saying?\" </p> <p>Rampton: \"I am saying that they are English. Most of them are born here, just as all the Jews in England were born here, most of them.\" </p> <p>Irving: \"Are we talking about blacks or Jews now?\" </p> <p>Rampton: \"It does not matter. They are all English.\" </p> <p>(3) A traffic jam in North London. To pass the time, my daughter and I start to argue about whether having been born here makes her English. On her mother's side her grandparents were Greek refugees; on her father's side, American Jews, themselves the descendants of the \"economic migrants\" of the 19th century. My daughter agrees with Rampton, and, however much I argue to the contrary, remains convinced that she is, as she puts it, \"an Englander\". I am too fond of her to make use of the fact that she is, unknowingly, undercutting her case by using Yiddish. Besides, she is only four years old. </p> <p>When Diane Abbott asked whether asylum seekers should be forced to pawn their wedding rings, she may have thought her question was rhetorical - like Rampton's dismissal of the notion that being born here doesn't make you English. (Surely he knows that under Margaret Thatcher's 1981 Nationality Act, being born here doesn't even make you British.) But something besides wishful thinking links these episodes - a more disturbing set of associations thrown into high relief by another scene, in Dover last month, when customs officers opened the back of a lorry and found the bodies of 58 Chinese refugees piled against the back door. Press accounts said that the officers concerned would receive counselling and be allowed several days' leave. </p> <p>Pulling corpses off the back of a lorry is nasty work, even when the deaths are intentional. Between December 1941, and May 1942, the Nazis used three specially adapted lorries to kill 97,000 Jews near the village of Chelmno in Poland. These vehicles were prone to breakdowns, but, according to Christopher Browning, the author of The Path To Genocide and an expert witness at the Irving trial, the real problem was with the men. Browning cites a Nazi medical report describing the crews as suffering \"enormous emotional and health injuries\" and complaining of headaches after each unloading. Indeed, the desire to spare the Einsatzgruppen such stresses was one of the reasons behind Himmler's decision to shift to stationary, purpose-built gas chambers. </p> <p>For several months Britain has been in the midst of a Holocaust revival. From the daily coverage of the Irving trial, to David Edgar's dramatisation of Gitta Sereny\"s Albert Speer at the National Theatre, to the newly opened gallery at the Imperial War Museum, public awareness of the fate of European Jews is probably greater now than at any time in recent memory. The one place it hasn't penetrated is the current debate about Britain's treatment of refugees. If it had, those politicians who profess to be \"shocked and saddened\" at the death of 58 illegal immigrants might find the rest of us more sceptical when they suggest that the way to avoid such tragedies is to make it even harder for refugees to enter this country. As Louise London's recent book, Whitehall and the Jews 1933-48, reminds us, we have been down that road before. </p> <p>Assumptions about Britain's response to the Holocaust fall into two distinct, and diametrically opposed, schools. In 1945, Viscount Cranborne, parliamentary under secretary to the Foreign Office until 1938, and secretary for the dominions from 1943 to 1945, assured the House of Lords that Britain had done more than any other country to help the Jews. \"This comfortable view has proved remarkably durable,\" says London, \"and is still adduced to support claims that Britain has always admitted genuine refugees, and that the latest harsh measures against asylum seekers are merely designed to exclude bogus applicants.\" </p> <p>Nor is the left, always on the look-out for a stick with which to beat the government, immune to nostalgia for a supposedly more generous past. Cranborne's assertion came in response to Viscount Samuel, who had accused the government of condemning the Jews, \"not as Jews, but by means of immigration restrictions _ Out of that vast reservoir of misery and murder, only a trickle of escape was provided.\" Bernard Wasserstein examined this claim in some detail in Britain And The Jews Of Europe, 1939-45 (1979), as have numerous historians on both sides of the Atlantic since then. </p> <p>On the numbers alone, Britain's accusers appear to have the better case. Compare the 500,000-600,000 files on families and individuals seeking refuge in the archives of Britain's main Jewish organisations with the 80,000 refugees actually admitted. Clearly, this is not a question of a glass anywhere near half full. And as London points out, even the Kindertransports had their grim aspect. Of the 7,482 children given refuge here by the end of August 1939, London writes: \"Admission saved the children's lives. Exclusion sealed the fate of their parents.\" </p> <p>Last month's disclosure that MI6 knew about Nazi plans to \"liquidate\" 8,000 Roman Jews, yet did nothing to warn them, made headlines. And the evidence, from documents declassified in the US, that decoded radio intercepts dealing with the deportations were circulated to Winston Churchill may well force a revision of the widely held view that, unlike some of his ministers, Churchill did what he could to help the Jews. But there were already many instances in the documentary record when Whitehall's reluctance to admit refugees is expressed in language whose brutal frankness crosses over from callous indifference to outright anti-Semitism. </p> <p>In April 1943, for example, the cabinet committee on refugees, meeting on the eve of the Bermuda conference, felt compelled to point out that \"the Jewish element in the population of Poland was proportionally higher than was healthy\". At the time this observation was made, more than three-quarters of Poland's Jews had already been murdered. That December, RAM Hankey of the Foreign Office minuted his objection to an American request to allow funds to be sent to rescue 70,000 Romanian Jews: \"I suspect the real object of the scheme is financial - Jews in Europe getting out into dollars while there is yet time!\" </p> <p>In July 1944, when Jewish groups in Britain begged that something be done to save their brethren in Hungary - and when both they and the British government had every reason to know the fate of deported Jews - Herbert Morrison told the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, that it was \"essential that we should do nothing at all which involves the risk that the further reception of refugees here might be the ultimate outcome\". </p> <p>Louise London is the daughter of Jewish refugees, but her book is not a parochial indictment. As she points out, Britain's \"softly softly\" approach to Nazi anti-Semitism in the 1930s was supported by prominent British Jews, including Sir Herbert Samuel, who opposed a boycott on German goods. The fear that allowing too many Jews into Britain would trigger anti-Semitism here was shared by Whitehall mandarins and the Board of Deputies. After all, it was Chaim Weizmann, president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and later Israel's first president, who claimed that Jews \"have proved they are an insoluble element\" in European society. </p> <p>When, after the Anschluss, Britain reintroduced a visa requirement - forcing refugees to apply before entering Britain - the move was endorsed by Otto Schiff, on the grounds that \"Austrian Jews were largely of the shopkeeper and small trader class and would therefore prove much more difficult to emigrate than the average German who had come to the United Kingdom\". </p> <p>In the spring of 1933, Schiff and Neville Laski, KC, head of the board of deputies, sent the government a guarantee that no refugee would become a burden on public funds: \"All expense, whether temporary or permanent accommodation or maintenance, will be borne by the Jewish community without ultimate charge to the state.\" But when it came to Austrian Jews, the guarantee was made conditional. And when Czech Jews started fleeing in the wake of Munich, \"Jewish organisations in Britain refused to take responsibility for refugees from Czechoslovakia\". Schiff's Council for German Jewry \"resisted, to the last, all pressure to get directly involved in arranging the entry of Czech Jews. This made it certain that relatively few would obtain refuge in Britain.\" </p> <p>For the most part, London tells a story without heroes. She praises Eleanor Rathbone, the Christian MP whose parliamentary questions about government inaction made her the scourge of the Refugee Department, and puts in a good word for Sir Herbert Emerson, high commissioner for refugees, who emerges as an energetic and resourceful advocate of assistance. She also displays a great deal of sympathy for civil servants, often cast as Hitler's witting accomplices, especially in Zionist accounts. \"The strength of the belief of Home Office civil servants that ministers were wrong to insist that refugees should be required to leave after the end of the war is shown,\" she writes, \"by the effort they put into arguing the case that the only proper course was one of allowing the absorption of refugees who wished to remain.\" Even Neville Chamberlain gets credit for expanding asylum provision after Kristallnacht. </p> <p>The only conspicuous villain in her account is Herbert Morrison, whose determination to keep the Jews out of Britain didn't end with VE day. Despite civil service advice, Morrison \"clung to the view that at the end of the war the Home Office should require all refugees to depart, not even excepting those who had voluntarily served in the armed forces, and that those refugees who could not emigrate could be repatriated.\" </p> <p>London's main interest, however, is in policy, not personalities. And here what she has to say is a salutary corrective both to the view that Whitehall anti-Semitism was primarily to blame for Britain's failure to do more, and to those who feel that there has been a lamentable falling off in compas sion towards asylum seekers since the second world war. She makes it clear that \"by the 1930s the UK's tradition of granting asylum to refugees had been relegated to the background. Still the source of much national pride, the humanitarian tradition had little impact on practice and had been largely superseded. The inter-war system of immigration control contained no trace of any legal obligation to admit refugees.\" </p> <p> From the 1950 Aliens Act onwards, London argues, admission to Britain has depended on the government of the day's perception of British interest. During the Nazi period \"humanitarian aid to the Jews was assigned much lower priority than, for example, the maintenance of severe restrictions on alien immigration to the UK _ Thus, while the particulars of refugee policy varied according to the ever-changing circumstances of the Jews, its limits were defined by self-interest.\" </p> <p>In other words, there may have been times when, either because of public pressure or out of a need to keep the Americans (who had Jewish voters to worry about) onside, it was necessary to appear to act, but the limits on what might be done were never questioned, at least not within Whitehall. </p> <p>When Anthony Eden said, \"we should avoid any reproach that we are not doing all we can to rescue these unfortunate people,\" London explains that \"the object was not to rescue Jews, but to avoid the reproach that Britain was not doing all it could to rescue Jews. The priority, therefore, was to reduce public pressure for action and avoid criticism of inaction.\" Which is why the April 1943 Bermuda conference on refugees, a disaster from the point of view of the refugees and their advocates, \"was seen as a success for British policy. The conference decisions provided a rationale for refusing to act on demands for rescue. They also enabled the government to appear to be trying to ameliorate the position of refugees.\" </p> <p>It is impossible to read London's book without a mounting sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Take out the word Jews and put in its place Romanies or Ethiopians or Kosovars or Bosnians and you have the essence of New Labour's asylum policy. The 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees is often seen as an act of reparation on the part of governments that spectacularly failed to save the Jews. But it is important to remember that it was also an artefact of the cold war, which brought its own countervailing pressure to bear on the national interest. That pressure is now gone, and Jack Straw is able to tell an EU conference that the convention should be changed so that asylum seekers are allowed to submit their claims before they enter Europe. </p> <p>If all the current protections are kept in place, this might be a welcome step. But it is more likely that the government means to screen asylum seekers in their place of origin, with the same hostile intent that forced Austrian and Czech Jews to apply for visas. Why else would the Tories - though they object to Straw's willingness to work through European institutions - be so supportive? That his own grandmother, a German Jewish refugee, might have been kept out by such a policy is no more of a restraining influence on the present Home Secretary than it would have been on his predecessor, himself the son of a Jewish refugee. </p> <p>\u0095 A version of this article first appeared in the London Review of Books.

My daughter agrees with Rampton, and, however much I argue to the contrary, remains convinced that she is, as she puts it, \"an Englander\". I am too fond of her to make use of the fact that she is, unknowingly, undercutting her case by using Yiddish. Besides, she is only four years old. When Diane Abbott asked whether asylum seekers should be forced to pawn their wedding rings, she may have thought her question was rhetorical - like Rampton's dismissal of the notion that being born here doesn't make you English. (Surely he knows that under Margaret Thatcher's 1981 Nationality Act, being born here doesn't even make you British.) But something besides wishful thinking links these episodes - a more disturbing set of associations thrown into high relief by another scene, in Dover last month, when customs officers opened the back of a lorry and found the bodies of 58 Chinese refugees piled against the back door. Press accounts said that the officers concerned would receive counselling and be allowed several days' leave. Pulling corpses off the back of a lorry is nasty work, even when the deaths are intentional. Between December 1941, and May 1942, the Nazis used three specially adapted lorries to kill 97,000 Jews near the village of Chelmno in Poland. These vehicles were prone to breakdowns, but, according to Christopher Browning, the author of The Path To Genocide and an expert witness at the Irving trial, the real problem was with the men. Browning cites a Nazi medical report describing the crews as suffering \"enormous emotional and health injuries\" and complaining of headaches after each unloading. Indeed, the desire to spare the Einsatzgruppen such stresses was one of the reasons behind Himmler's decision to shift to stationary, purpose-built gas chambers. For several months Britain has been in the midst of a Holocaust revival. From the daily coverage of the Irving trial, to David Edgar's dramatisation of Gitta Sereny\"s Albert Speer at the National Theatre, to the newly opened gallery at the Imperial War Museum, public awareness of the fate of European Jews is probably greater now than at any time in recent memory. The one place it hasn't penetrated is the current debate about Britain's treatment of refugees. If it had, those politicians who profess to be \"shocked and saddened\" at the death of 58 illegal immigrants might find the rest of us more sceptical when they suggest that the way to avoid such tragedies is to make it even harder for refugees to enter this country. As Louise London's recent book, Whitehall and the Jews 1933-48, reminds us, we have been down that road before. Assumptions about Britain's response to the Holocaust fall into two distinct, and diametrically opposed, schools. In 1945, Viscount Cranborne, parliamentary under secretary to the Foreign Office until 1938, and secretary for the dominions from 1943 to 1945, assured the House of Lords that Britain had done more than any other country to help the Jews. \"This comfortable view has proved remarkably durable,\" says London, \"and is still adduced to support claims that Britain has always admitted genuine refugees, and that the latest harsh measures against asylum seekers are merely designed to exclude bogus applicants.\" Nor is the left, always on the look-out for a stick with which to beat the government, immune to nostalgia for a supposedly more generous past. Cranborne's assertion came in response to Viscount Samuel, who had accused the government of condemning the Jews, \"not as Jews, but by means of immigration restrictions _ Out of that vast reservoir of misery and murder, only a trickle of escape was provided.\" Bernard Wasserstein examined this claim in some detail in Britain And The Jews Of Europe, 1939-45 (1979), as have numerous historians on both sides of the Atlantic since then. On the numbers alone, Britain's accusers appear to have the better case. Compare the 500,000-600,000 files on families and individuals seeking refuge in the archives of Britain's main Jewish organisations with the 80,000 refugees actually admitted. Clearly, this is not a question of a glass anywhere near half full. And as London points out, even the Kindertransports had their grim aspect. Of the 7,482 children given refuge here by the end of August 1939, London writes: \"Admission saved the children's lives. Exclusion sealed the fate of their parents.\" Last month's disclosure that MI6 knew about Nazi plans to \"liquidate\" 8,000 Roman Jews, yet did nothing to warn them, made headlines. And the evidence, from documents declassified in the US, that decoded radio intercepts dealing with the deportations were circulated to Winston Churchill may well force a revision of the widely held view that, unlike some of his ministers, Churchill did what he could to help the Jews. But there were already many instances in the documentary record when Whitehall's reluctance to admit refugees is expressed in language whose brutal frankness crosses over from callous indifference to outright anti-Semitism. In April 1943, for example, the cabinet committee on refugees, meeting on the eve of the Bermuda conference, felt compelled to point out that \"the Jewish element in the population of Poland was proportionally higher than was healthy\". At the time this observation was made, more than three-quarters of Poland's Jews had already been murdered. That December, RAM Hankey of the Foreign Office minuted his objection to an American request to allow funds to be sent to rescue 70,000 Romanian Jews: \"I suspect the real object of the scheme is financial - Jews in Europe getting out into dollars while there is yet time!\" In July 1944, when Jewish groups in Britain begged that something be done to save their brethren in Hungary - and when both they and the British government had every reason to know the fate of deported Jews - Herbert Morrison told the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, that it was \"essential that we should do nothing at all which involves the risk that the further reception of refugees here might be the ultimate outcome\". Louise London is the daughter of Jewish refugees, but her book is not a parochial indictment. As she points out, Britain's \"softly softly\" approach to Nazi anti-Semitism in the 1930s was supported by prominent British Jews, including Sir Herbert Samuel, who opposed a boycott on German goods. The fear that allowing too many Jews into Britain would trigger anti-Semitism here was shared by Whitehall mandarins and the Board of Deputies. After all, it was Chaim Weizmann, president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine and later Israel's first president, who claimed that Jews \"have proved they are an insoluble element\" in European society. When, after the Anschluss, Britain reintroduced a visa requirement - forcing refugees to apply before entering Britain - the move was endorsed by Otto Schiff, on the grounds that \"Austrian Jews were largely of the shopkeeper and small trader class and would therefore prove much more difficult to emigrate than the average German who had come to the United Kingdom\". In the spring of 1933, Schiff and Neville Laski, KC, head of the board of deputies, sent the government a guarantee that no refugee would become a burden on public funds: \"All expense, whether temporary or permanent accommodation or maintenance, will be borne by the Jewish community without ultimate charge to the state.\" But when it came to Austrian Jews, the guarantee was made conditional. And when Czech Jews started fleeing in the wake of Munich, \"Jewish organisations in Britain refused to take responsibility for refugees from Czechoslovakia\". Schiff's Council for German Jewry \"resisted, to the last, all pressure to get directly involved in arranging the entry of Czech Jews. This made it certain that relatively few would obtain refuge in Britain.\" For the most part, London tells a story without heroes. She praises Eleanor Rathbone, the Christian MP whose parliamentary questions about government inaction made her the scourge of the Refugee Department, and puts in a good word for Sir Herbert Emerson, high commissioner for refugees, who emerges as an energetic and resourceful advocate of assistance. She also displays a great deal of sympathy for civil servants, often cast as Hitler's witting accomplices, especially in Zionist accounts. \"The strength of the belief of Home Office civil servants that ministers were wrong to insist that refugees should be required to leave after the end of the war is shown,\" she writes, \"by the effort they put into arguing the case that the only proper course was one of allowing the absorption of refugees who wished to remain.\" Even Neville Chamberlain gets credit for expanding asylum provision after Kristallnacht. The only conspicuous villain in her account is Herbert Morrison, whose determination to keep the Jews out of Britain didn't end with VE day. Despite civil service advice, Morrison \"clung to the view that at the end of the war the Home Office should require all refugees to depart, not even excepting those who had voluntarily served in the armed forces, and that those refugees who could not emigrate could be repatriated.\" London's main interest, however, is in policy, not personalities. And here what she has to say is a salutary corrective both to the view that Whitehall anti-Semitism was primarily to blame for Britain's failure to do more, and to those who feel that there has been a lamentable falling off in compas sion towards asylum seekers since the second world war. She makes it clear that \"by the 1930s the UK's tradition of granting asylum to refugees had been relegated to the background. Still the source of much national pride, the humanitarian tradition had little impact on practice and had been largely superseded. The inter-war system of immigration control contained no trace of any legal obligation to admit refugees.\" From the 1950 Aliens Act onwards, London argues, admission to Britain has depended on the government of the day's perception of British interest. During the Nazi period \"humanitarian aid to the Jews was assigned much lower priority than, for example, the maintenance of severe restrictions on alien immigration to the UK _ Thus, while the particulars of refugee policy varied according to the ever-changing circumstances of the Jews, its limits were defined by self-interest.\" In other words, there may have been times when, either because of public pressure or out of a need to keep the Americans (who had Jewish voters to worry about) onside, it was necessary to appear to act, but the limits on what might be done were never questioned, at least not within Whitehall. When Anthony Eden said, \"we should avoid any reproach that we are not doing all we can to rescue these unfortunate people,\" London explains that \"the object was not to rescue Jews, but to avoid the reproach that Britain was not doing all it could to rescue Jews. The priority, therefore, was to reduce public pressure for action and avoid criticism of inaction.\" Which is why the April 1943 Bermuda conference on refugees, a disaster from the point of view of the refugees and their advocates, \"was seen as a success for British policy. The conference decisions provided a rationale for refusing to act on demands for rescue. They also enabled the government to appear to be trying to ameliorate the position of refugees.\" It is impossible to read London's book without a mounting sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Take out the word Jews and put in its place Romanies or Ethiopians or Kosovars or Bosnians and you have the essence of New Labour's asylum policy. The 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees is often seen as an act of reparation on the part of governments that spectacularly failed to save the Jews. But it is important to remember that it was also an artefact of the cold war, which brought its own countervailing pressure to bear on the national interest. That pressure is now gone, and Jack Straw is able to tell an EU conference that the convention should be changed so that asylum seekers are allowed to submit their claims before they enter Europe. If all the current protections are kept in place, this might be a welcome step. But it is more likely that the government means to screen asylum seekers in their place of origin, with the same hostile intent that forced Austrian and Czech Jews to apply for visas. Why else would the Tories - though they object to Straw's willingness to work through European institutions - be so supportive? That his own grandmother, a German Jewish refugee, might have been kept out by such a policy is no more of a restraining influence on the present Home Secretary than it would have been on his predecessor, himself the son of a Jewish refugee. \u0095 A version of this article first appeared in the London Review of Books.

      "body": "<p>Sheila Rowbotham's study is exactly that of the absent-minded writer. There is no overt order, no stern clearing for the author at work. Every corner and shelf is stuffed to overspilling with books, papers, magazines. While most of her life has been spent scraping a living from teaching, political projects and research grants, it has in recent years become somewhat more financially and professionally settled: for the past five she has been a research fellow at Manchester University and was recently appointed as a reader. But home - in a Manchester suburb - is still the place she likes best to write, even when there are two televisions blaring. </p> <p>In T-shirt and dark trousers, the trademark red hair in a neat cut, she does not look anything near her 57 years. According to one friend there is now just the touch of the grande dame: \"she is very conscious of her intellectual territory, she does not take well to being maligned\". There is something extraordinarily still, almost stubborn about her, especially when crossed. She has never developed a hard shell in relation to public life; critics have been known to receive letters literally splashed with Rowbotham's tears of anguish. But she is also giggly, loquacious, radiant. </p> <p>In her youth an intensely serious sexual libertarian, a socialist with an interest in everything from religion to rock, the pretty young historian was perceived as a potent mix of Marx, Methodism and Marianne Faithfull, a mix old friends still refer to. In one early incident, Jean-Luc Godard wanted her to walk naked up and down stairs while he filmed her speaking \"words of emancipation\", a request that the modest Rowbotham refused, on the characteristically prosaic grounds that her breasts were too big and floppy for 60s fashion. </p> <p>She has been called the most underrated feminist of our time, a ghost at the feast of the politics she helped create. To many, it is a mystery why she is not a more famous feminist, like Germaine Greer or, to a lesser extent, Juliet Mitchell, elder stateswomen who are endlessly consulted and quarrelled with, praised and provoked. Sally Alexander, professor of modern history at Goldsmiths College, London, says: \"Sheila is not a media person, but in other ways she reminds me of Germaine Greer. Both are scholars and writers, although Greer was never part of any political movement. But they are both deeply radical.\" </p> <p>Like Greer and Mitchell, Rowbotham emerged in the early, heady days of women's liberation. Like them, she is a pioneer who has not merely survived but reinvented herself many times over. Rowbotham, in particular, had an enormous impact on her generation: her early books, dense texts that explored women's neglected role in radical history and the dawnings of a new consciousness, had a profound influence on the emerging movement. </p> <p>And then something happened. Rowbotham didn't stop writing, but the ideologies and reference points that had both sparked and buoyed up her work slowly dissolved. Women's liberation became feminism, a quite different politics that soon splintered into a maelstrom of competing arguments and identities. Thatcherism individualised women's quest for change, gave it shoulder pads and selfishness. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, official socialism lost its last shred of moral and economic power, taking the elaborate critiques of unofficial, libertarian socialisms with it, at least for a while. What happened to Sheila Rowbotham was what happened to socialist feminism: both were suddenly considered unfashionable, dull. Nobody in the broadsheet-reading classes thought it relevant any longer, all this intense utopian questing after the lives and lore of the working class, especially women, this earnest desire to fit together the jigsaw of socialist and feminist aspiration. </p> <p>But that Yorkshire stubbornness which refused Godard's seductive request has never disappeared. In the intervening decades, Rowbotham has carried on writing about history and politics, capitalism and change, personal and public life, in that idiosyncratic style which mixes the solidly empirical with the almost dreamily theoretical. As a result, she now stands as one of feminism's great chroniclers, an accessible writer about complex social movements and significant moments of social and economic transformation. </p> <p>Her output has been prodigious. Since the late 70s she has published a long essay on feminism and socialism in Beyond The Fragments, a biography, a book of interviews, two volumes of collected essays, a play, an encyclopedic history of the birth of radical movements, and a study of modern feminism in action, as well as articles, talks, even poems. A Century Of Women, her monumental history of women in Britain and America in the 20th century, was published in 1997. Promise Of A Dream, a personal memoir of the politics of the 60s published this month, is her 17th book. </p> <p>In the mid-90s she co-authored two books on women in the global economy, which took her to India. In Bombay she talked to unemployed textile workers establishing a new living feeding shift workers. In Gujerat she met street scavengers trying to organise cooperative rubbish collection. Street vendors, forced by police to pay them bribes, held a demonstration featuring the slogan \"Dignity and Daily Bread\"; Rowbotham took it for the title of a book. </p> <p>There are many ironies about Rowbotham's career. Sometimes maligned as the epitome of 70s feminism, her work has frequently failed to reach a wider audience, not because of some arcane polemicism but because of its very complexity, its attempt to connect women's struggles with changes in the economy and politics. A new generation of feminist historians and academics talk of her work with respect, but younger media feminists tend to ignore rather than dismiss her, partly because she deals with class issues rather than with popular culture. Her work was always about far more than Madonna or Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that in The New Feminism, Natasha Walter focused on Greer, not Rowbotham, who hardly gets a men tion. Greer's The Female Eunuch is full of certainties while Rowbotham's writing has, in the words of her friend Lynne Segal, \"an almost infuriating tentativeness\". She is an elaborate and poetic writer whose style works particularly well in the essay form. But lack of public attention has suited her. As a generation of academics have increasingly turned to questions of representation and identity, and a generation of female journalists investigate their own or other celebrity lives, few writers look any longer at what used to be called the bread-and-butter issues. </p> <p>When future generations ask what were the campaigns and issues that occupied ordinary women in the late 20th and early 21st century, they will find the answer in Rowbotham's work. Here are the human and political tales of, among others, office workers in America, miners' wives in Britain, home workers in Bradford, cleaners in London, tenant organisers in South Wales, poor women in India. These stories now fill a unique space in our political culture. </p> <p>The historian Dorothy Thompson, who has known Rowbotham since the mid-60s, says: \"She is one of the few people who has kept links with the trade union movement, with home workers, with adult education. She understands that that woman smoking quietly in the corner of the factory floor has a fight on her hands, keeping her kids in shoes. She sees her as a human being. That is why her work remains relevant, always pushing out frontiers.\" </p> <p>Rowbotham is nervous about Promise Of A Dream. Even before its official publication, it has been attacked by Jenny Diski in the London Review of Books for its earnestness, its refusal of a mature, graceful disappointment at lost dreams. But, Rowbotham insists, she just wanted to tell it like it was: \"I got fed up with the way the 60s is misrepresented. I was on this radio discussion a few years back and either it was about revolutionary students or the Oz hippie world. But there was so much more than that. There was community and trade union politics, all the apprentices and dock workers, the kind of people I was teaching in adult education. No one talks about the working class in the 60s, but it was a ferment, all these barriers breaking down. And then there were important movements in art. It's funny now that people I knew vaguely in passing, like the artist David Medalla, have big books written about their work.\" </p> <p>Rowbotham was born in Harehills, Yorkshire, in 1943, the late child of elderly parents, who already had a 17-year-old son, Peter. Her father, a trained engineer, sold pit motors on commission to the National Coal Board. Her mother was considerably younger than him, and was a stylish and affectionate woman who found the constraints and economic dependence of marriage difficult. \"She loved going to a big hotel and taking tea,\" says Rowbotham, \"and wherever she was, a man would appear and light her cigarette.\" </p> <p>Rowbotham describes herself as \"a mistake. My mother had just come out of hospital after treatment for breast cancer and did not discover she was pregnant until it was too late. She tried to take quinine to get rid of me, but it didn't work.\" Rowbotham loved her mother, but was forever clashing with her father, a political conservative \"who hated posh people. When people like Hugh Trevor-Roper came on television he would shout at the screen.\" </p> <p>At 10, Rowbotham was sent to boarding school in east Yorkshire where she was very unhappy. But then, \"I began to read, and suddenly the words got to me and it was like a penny dropping.\" A stylish and sardonic teacher called Olga introduced her to social history, taking her to look at archives where \"we could read about what people ate in the workhouse\". </p> <p>Later, the teenage Rowbotham became a beat, doing her best to look the part in a big black sweater, tight skirts from Leeds C&amp;A and lashings of eyeliner. Promise Of A Dream records the agony and ecstasy of the late teens and early 20s: trips to Paris, first sexual encounters, worries about love, dependency, orgasm, clothes, hair, having the right - or left - views and attitudes. </p> <p>At Oxford, she found the \"straight history\" of Gibbon and Macaulay boring but was rescued by the iconoclastic historian Richard Cobb, who sent her off to meet some friends of his in Halifax. These turned out to be the historians Edward and Dorothy Thompson. They were nervous, Rowbotham records, about her arrival, fearing she was pregnant and abandoned by an older lover. Instead they found an intense young historian, keen to exchange ideas on politics and history. Dorothy Thompson remembers her as something like the comic character Tiger Tim. \"Richard Cobb used to call her that because of the red hair and because he'd seen her involved in some argument. We took to Sheila as soon as we saw her. She was very bright, inquisitive, very spirited, pretty. and charming.\" </p> <p>In the late 60s, Rowbotham began working on Black Dwarf, the revolutionary newspaper, which attracted the likes of Tariq Ali, Robin Blackburn, Anthony Barnett and Fred Halliday. Sally Alexander met Rowbotham in 1967 at the flat of the writer and film-maker Clive Goodwin. \"My memory is of Sheila and I sitting on the floor at Clive's stuffing envelopes. She was very beautiful. She had this pale skin, large wide-apart eyes, always friendly and smiley. And she had an encyclopedic knowledge of the radical left.\" </p> <p>Tariq Ali persuaded her to try her hand at writing, which resulted in one of the first pieces ever written on women's liberation in this country, published in the centre of a special issue on women in Black Dwarf in early 1969. Writing the article, she says, was \"like reaching a clearing. I knew I must not write from received authorities on 'women' but from my own observations and feelings. Suddenly all those scattered experiences could take a new shape.\" </p> <p>When, in her early 20s, her parents died, the young Rowbotham was drawn to powerful parental and intellectual mentors like the Thompsons and the magisterial historian Eric Hobsbawm, supervisor on her unfinished PhD, who has remained a friend for more than 30 years. Friendships, too, quickly became intense, and have proved remarkably long-lasting. The journalist Nigel Fountain, who lived in Rowbotham's rather chaotic Hackney house during the 70s, describes it as \"the most wonderful intellectual experience of my life. I can still see Sheila wandering in at three in the morning because she'd had an idea. The funny thing about talking to Sheila was that she made no distinction between people who were alive and people who had died 100 years ago.\" </p> <p>Promise Of A Dream ends just before the first women's liberation conference, organised by Rowbotham and Alexander, at Ruskin College, Oxford. Rowbotham was prolific in the next few years. Women, Resistance And Revolution, Woman's Consciousness, Man's World, and Hidden From History were all written in the early 70s. It is hard, in retrospect, to appreciate how groundbreaking these works were. Woman's Consciousness, Man's World is a highly disciplined but subjective volume about love and longing, capitalism and consumption, sex and history, which moves easily from Marx and Betty Friedan to the lyrics of Cliff Richard's \"Living Doll\" . </p> <p>Now we accept the jumble of high and low culture; then it was an innovation. Hidden From History was clearly influenced by EP Thompson's excavation of unknown English popular movements: Rowbotham re-examined women's role in four centuries of radical history. Eric Hobsbawm says the work was pioneering. She \"mapped the ground for us\", says Alexander simply. </p> <p>As one of the first feminist writers, featured in the nationals, interviewed by Jill Tweedie on television about women, resistance and revolution (\"the only thing my revolutionary friends who had been watching in a pub in Islington said afterwards was that my hair had looked nice and tidy\"), the young Rowbotham was inevitably exposed. In her own recent memoir of early feminist activism in the United States, Susan Brownmiller records the intense pressures on these early stars. Publishers wanted them to write \"big books\", or the same big book over and over again, while other women criticised them for taking all the glory. </p> <p>Rowbotham says now, \"I wasn't good at being an individual star. I just didn't enjoy it. It was a strain living up to others' ideas of what I should be like. By temperament I love watching and observing.\" Dorothy Thompson says \"the marvellous thing about her is that she has never allowed herself to become a celebrity, which would have been easy for someone as intelligent and sparky as she\". Rowbotham remembers \"getting a bit tearful, having a bit of a breakdown, about my own role as an individual. But this collectivity also had a really positive side which offset all the suspicion. It was very confirming to have this sense of connection; it helped you do things you otherwise wouldn't do.\" </p> <p>By the late 70s, feminism was changing. Rowbotham remembers being at a socialist feminist meeting in 1976 \"and someone started talking about careers\". The days of scraping by with a couple of days teaching were finally passing. Politically, feminism was breaking up, or breaking down, depending on your point of view. Lynne Segal, a long-time friend and now professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, London, says \"by the early 1980s, socialist feminism was no longer a sexy subject. It was considered dull. Also, anyone trying to gain an overview of what was happening was declared suspect. The new was particularity, identity and difference, particularly ethnic difference.\" Segal thinks that was an important shift, but that these changes too easily led to a \"sibling war of younger sisters against the old guard, which was kind of ridiculous in relation to Sheila, who has always been on the outside. No one was less a part of the old feminist establishment.\" </p> <p>Rowbotham was always radical, but never a radical feminist. According to her friend John Hoyland, \"she was always very, very tough in her feminism but it was tempered by this enormous heterosexual enthusiasm\". Rowbotham also rejected any essentialist theories about masculinity or patriarchy. \"I was influenced by existentialism, so I resist fixed definitions. When you try and put something into an abstract category, you distort its living reality.\" </p> <p>An avowed sexual libertarian, Rowbotham has never married. There have been, instead, a series of committed but often combustible relationships with significant men of the left. Promise Of A Dream gives a poignant and often hilarious account of her relationship with a young Bob Rowthorn, now professor of economics at Cambridge. Thirty years on, it is not hard to spot the incompatibility of these two young radicals. Rowthorn was a keen athlete, a ferociously abstract and logical thinker, who kept his pencils stacked tidily in a jar. As Rowbotham records, \"he was not at all interested in my obsessive analysing of emotions and relationships\". </p> <p>In the 70s she lived with David Widgery, the socialist GP and writer. Widgery had guest-edited Oz, the hippie underground paper, and, says one friend, \"while Widgery had brought politics to Oz, Sheila was trying to bring cultural and feminist politics to the left. So they met somewhere in the middle.\" Nigel Fountain describes the relationship as \"tempestuous . . . they did feed off each other in terms of ideas, but there were a lot of slammed doors\". When Rowbotham left to have a child by Paul Atkinson, a young community activist, Widgery, says Fountain, was devastated. Friends say he never really forgave her, right up until his sudden death in 1992. </p> <p>Rowbotham says now that she chose to have a child \"with someone who in no way resembled my father, or had his anger\". When her son, Will, was born in 1977, she joined \"a group of women trying to think about their fathers. I had this little baby boy and I felt I had to understand my reaction to my father as an individual if I wasn't to pass on some of those problems to him. I had to get a more balanced relationship in my memory.\" When Will was five, Atkinson got involved with someone else, and Rowbotham lived alone until the mid-90s. She now lives with Derek Clarke, an assistant head and committed trade union and community activist. Will is now 23 and works as a librarian in London. </p> <p>Like many on the left in the 60s, Rowbotham had given up on the Labour Party, largely over Vietnam. But Ken Livingstone's GLC offered a new chance, as she says, \"to resist Thatcherism on a wider, more organised basis\". From 1983 to 1986 she worked at the GLC economic and social policy unit, editing a popular newspaper, Jobs for a Change, with John Hoyland. The GLC, she says, was \"libertarian but practical socialism. It distresses me that it is never talked about seriously but just dismissed with a sneer. We tried to work with people on the ground, community organisers, local groups. And so much has since become common sense, like the idea that people with disabilities should have access to the Tube.\" </p> <p>For her, personally, it was a happy period. \"It was true unalienated labour. I hate getting up in the morning, but I would be up and off to work at six on a Saturday morning. The Tories on the GLC simply couldn't understand this enthusiasm. They even thanked us for our work.\" When the GLC was finally abolished, Rowbotham, supporting her young son, thought she would turn her hand to freelance journalism, \"but by that time, I was a no-no. It just got harder and harder for me in Britain.\" In the late 80s she got RSI: \"I was immobilised for several months and for over a year couldn't handwrite for more than a few minutes. For two years I couldn't type on a computer.\" </p> <p>From the late 80s, searching for income and some political support, Rowbotham began to lecture in Canada and the United States and then did research for what she jokingly calls the \"Global GLC\", the United Nations University based in Helsinki and Maastricht. From this period dates her work on new forms of economic organisation among poor women in non- European countries, Dignity And Daily Bread, and changing patterns of employment in the developing world, Women Encounter Technology.

Politically, she says she sees a lot of similarities between the 60s and now - \"a new Labour government for the first time in a long time, this same uncritical attitude to modernisation, and a complacency about the inequalities of American-style capitalism. Class really does seem the unmentionable.\" She was heartened by the anti-capitalist demonstrations in Seattle. She and her partner joined a sister demonstration in Manchester, but \"it was tiny and they all looked like schoolchildren\". </p> <p>Rowbotham says she finds younger women mysterious and seemingly very confident, but is philosophical rather than disheartened by modern feminism. \"I find a lot of parallels with the 60s, where an unease about gender is expressed in cultural rather than political terms, and there's this laddish belief that we all shared that a woman can do and be anything.

      "bodyText": "Sheila Rowbotham's study is exactly that of the absent-minded writer. There is no overt order, no stern clearing for the author at work. Every corner and shelf is stuffed to overspilling with books, papers, magazines. While most of her life has been spent scraping a living from teaching, political projects and research grants, it has in recent years become somewhat more financially and professionally settled: for the past five she has been a research fellow at Manchester University and was recently appointed as a reader. But home - in a Manchester suburb - is still the place she likes best to write, even when there are two televisions blaring. In T-shirt and dark trousers, the trademark red hair in a neat cut, she does not look anything near her 57 years. According to one friend there is now just the touch of the grande dame: \"she is very conscious of her intellectual territory, she does not take well to being maligned\". There is something extraordinarily still, almost stubborn about her, especially when crossed. She has never developed a hard shell in relation to public life; critics have been known to receive letters literally splashed with Rowbotham's tears of anguish. But she is also giggly, loquacious, radiant. In her youth an intensely serious sexual libertarian, a socialist with an interest in everything from religion to rock, the pretty young historian was perceived as a potent mix of Marx, Methodism and Marianne Faithfull, a mix old friends still refer to. In one early incident, Jean-Luc Godard wanted her to walk naked up and down stairs while he filmed her speaking \"words of emancipation\", a request that the modest Rowbotham refused, on the characteristically prosaic grounds that her breasts were too big and floppy for 60s fashion. She has been called the most underrated feminist of our time, a ghost at the feast of the politics she helped create. To many, it is a mystery why she is not a more famous feminist, like Germaine Greer or, to a lesser extent, Juliet Mitchell, elder stateswomen who are endlessly consulted and quarrelled with, praised and provoked. Sally Alexander, professor of modern history at Goldsmiths College, London, says: \"Sheila is not a media person, but in other ways she reminds me of Germaine Greer. Both are scholars and writers, although Greer was never part of any political movement. But they are both deeply radical.\" Like Greer and Mitchell, Rowbotham emerged in the early, heady days of women's liberation. Like them, she is a pioneer who has not merely survived but reinvented herself many times over. Rowbotham, in particular, had an enormous impact on her generation: her early books, dense texts that explored women's neglected role in radical history and the dawnings of a new consciousness, had a profound influence on the emerging movement. And then something happened. Rowbotham didn't stop writing, but the ideologies and reference points that had both sparked and buoyed up her work slowly dissolved. Women's liberation became feminism, a quite different politics that soon splintered into a maelstrom of competing arguments and identities. Thatcherism individualised women's quest for change, gave it shoulder pads and selfishness. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, official socialism lost its last shred of moral and economic power, taking the elaborate critiques of unofficial, libertarian socialisms with it, at least for a while. What happened to Sheila Rowbotham was what happened to socialist feminism: both were suddenly considered unfashionable, dull. Nobody in the broadsheet-reading classes thought it relevant any longer, all this intense utopian questing after the lives and lore of the working class, especially women, this earnest desire to fit together the jigsaw of socialist and feminist aspiration. But that Yorkshire stubbornness which refused Godard's seductive request has never disappeared. In the intervening decades, Rowbotham has carried on writing about history and politics, capitalism and change, personal and public life, in that idiosyncratic style which mixes the solidly empirical with the almost dreamily theoretical. As a result, she now stands as one of feminism's great chroniclers, an accessible writer about complex social movements and significant moments of social and economic transformation. Her output has been prodigious. Since the late 70s she has published a long essay on feminism and socialism in Beyond The Fragments, a biography, a book of interviews, two volumes of collected essays, a play, an encyclopedic history of the birth of radical movements, and a study of modern feminism in action, as well as articles, talks, even poems. A Century Of Women, her monumental history of women in Britain and America in the 20th century, was published in 1997. Promise Of A Dream, a personal memoir of the politics of the 60s published this month, is her 17th book. In the mid-90s she co-authored two books on women in the global economy, which took her to India. In Bombay she talked to unemployed textile workers establishing a new living feeding shift workers. In Gujerat she met street scavengers trying to organise cooperative rubbish collection. Street vendors, forced by police to pay them bribes, held a demonstration featuring the slogan \"Dignity and Daily Bread\"; Rowbotham took it for the title of a book. There are many ironies about Rowbotham's career. Sometimes maligned as the epitome of 70s feminism, her work has frequently failed to reach a wider audience, not because of some arcane polemicism but because of its very complexity, its attempt to connect women's struggles with changes in the economy and politics. A new generation of feminist historians and academics talk of her work with respect, but younger media feminists tend to ignore rather than dismiss her, partly because she deals with class issues rather than with popular culture. Her work was always about far more than Madonna or Margaret Thatcher. It is hardly surprising that in The New Feminism, Natasha Walter focused on Greer, not Rowbotham, who hardly gets a men tion. Greer's The Female Eunuch is full of certainties while Rowbotham's writing has, in the words of her friend Lynne Segal, \"an almost infuriating tentativeness\". She is an elaborate and poetic writer whose style works particularly well in the essay form. But lack of public attention has suited her. As a generation of academics have increasingly turned to questions of representation and identity, and a generation of female journalists investigate their own or other celebrity lives, few writers look any longer at what used to be called the bread-and-butter issues. When future generations ask what were the campaigns and issues that occupied ordinary women in the late 20th and early 21st century, they will find the answer in Rowbotham's work. Here are the human and political tales of, among others, office workers in America, miners' wives in Britain, home workers in Bradford, cleaners in London, tenant organisers in South Wales, poor women in India. These stories now fill a unique space in our political culture. The historian Dorothy Thompson, who has known Rowbotham since the mid-60s, says: \"She is one of the few people who has kept links with the trade union movement, with home workers, with adult education. She understands that that woman smoking quietly in the corner of the factory floor has a fight on her hands, keeping her kids in shoes. She sees her as a human being. That is why her work remains relevant, always pushing out frontiers.\" Rowbotham is nervous about Promise Of A Dream. Even before its official publication, it has been attacked by Jenny Diski in the London Review of Books for its earnestness, its refusal of a mature, graceful disappointment at lost dreams. But, Rowbotham insists, she just wanted to tell it like it was: \"I got fed up with the way the 60s is misrepresented. I was on this radio discussion a few years back and either it was about revolutionary students or the Oz hippie world. But there was so much more than that. There was community and trade union politics, all the apprentices and dock workers, the kind of people I was teaching in adult education. No one talks about the working class in the 60s, but it was a ferment, all these barriers breaking down. And then there were important movements in art. It's funny now that people I knew vaguely in passing, like the artist David Medalla, have big books written about their work.\" Rowbotham was born in Harehills, Yorkshire, in 1943, the late child of elderly parents, who already had a 17-year-old son, Peter. Her father, a trained engineer, sold pit motors on commission to the National Coal Board. Her mother was considerably younger than him, and was a stylish and affectionate woman who found the constraints and economic dependence of marriage difficult. \"She loved going to a big hotel and taking tea,\" says Rowbotham, \"and wherever she was, a man would appear and light her cigarette.\" Rowbotham describes herself as \"a mistake. My mother had just come out of hospital after treatment for breast cancer and did not discover she was pregnant until it was too late. She tried to take quinine to get rid of me, but it didn't work.\" Rowbotham loved her mother, but was forever clashing with her father, a political conservative \"who hated posh people. When people like Hugh Trevor-Roper came on television he would shout at the screen.\" At 10, Rowbotham was sent to boarding school in east Yorkshire where she was very unhappy. But then, \"I began to read, and suddenly the words got to me and it was like a penny dropping.\" A stylish and sardonic teacher called Olga introduced her to social history, taking her to look at archives where \"we could read about what people ate in the workhouse\". Later, the teenage Rowbotham became a beat, doing her best to look the part in a big black sweater, tight skirts from Leeds C&amp;A and lashings of eyeliner. Promise Of A Dream records the agony and ecstasy of the late teens and early 20s: trips to Paris, first sexual encounters, worries about love, dependency, orgasm, clothes, hair, having the right - or left - views and attitudes. At Oxford, she found the \"straight history\" of Gibbon and Macaulay boring but was rescued by the iconoclastic historian Richard Cobb, who sent her off to meet some friends of his in Halifax. These turned out to be the historians Edward and Dorothy Thompson. They were nervous, Rowbotham records, about her arrival, fearing she was pregnant and abandoned by an older lover. Instead they found an intense young historian, keen to exchange ideas on politics and history. Dorothy Thompson remembers her as something like the comic character Tiger Tim. \"Richard Cobb used to call her that because of the red hair and because he'd seen her involved in some argument. We took to Sheila as soon as we saw her. She was very bright, inquisitive, very spirited, pretty. and charming.\" In the late 60s, Rowbotham began working on Black Dwarf, the revolutionary newspaper, which attracted the likes of Tariq Ali, Robin Blackburn, Anthony Barnett and Fred Halliday. Sally Alexander met Rowbotham in 1967 at the flat of the writer and film-maker Clive Goodwin. \"My memory is of Sheila and I sitting on the floor at Clive's stuffing envelopes. She was very beautiful. She had this pale skin, large wide-apart eyes, always friendly and smiley. And she had an encyclopedic knowledge of the radical left.\" Tariq Ali persuaded her to try her hand at writing, which resulted in one of the first pieces ever written on women's liberation in this country, published in the centre of a special issue on women in Black Dwarf in early 1969. Writing the article, she says, was \"like reaching a clearing. I knew I must not write from received authorities on 'women' but from my own observations and feelings. Suddenly all those scattered experiences could take a new shape.\" When, in her early 20s, her parents died, the young Rowbotham was drawn to powerful parental and intellectual mentors like the Thompsons and the magisterial historian Eric Hobsbawm, supervisor on her unfinished PhD, who has remained a friend for more than 30 years. Friendships, too, quickly became intense, and have proved remarkably long-lasting. The journalist Nigel Fountain, who lived in Rowbotham's rather chaotic Hackney house during the 70s, describes it as \"the most wonderful intellectual experience of my life. I can still see Sheila wandering in at three in the morning because she'd had an idea. The funny thing about talking to Sheila was that she made no distinction between people who were alive and people who had died 100 years ago.\" Promise Of A Dream ends just before the first women's liberation conference, organised by Rowbotham and Alexander, at Ruskin College, Oxford. Rowbotham was prolific in the next few years. Women, Resistance And Revolution, Woman's Consciousness, Man's World, and Hidden From History were all written in the early 70s. It is hard, in retrospect, to appreciate how groundbreaking these works were. Woman's Consciousness, Man's World is a highly disciplined but subjective volume about love and longing, capitalism and consumption, sex and history, which moves easily from Marx and Betty Friedan to the lyrics of Cliff Richard's \"Living Doll\" . Now we accept the jumble of high and low culture; then it was an innovation. Hidden From History was clearly influenced by EP Thompson's excavation of unknown English popular movements: Rowbotham re-examined women's role in four centuries of radical history. Eric Hobsbawm says the work was pioneering. She \"mapped the ground for us\", says Alexander simply. As one of the first feminist writers, featured in the nationals, interviewed by Jill Tweedie on television about women, resistance and revolution (\"the only thing my revolutionary friends who had been watching in a pub in Islington said afterwards was that my hair had looked nice and tidy\"), the young Rowbotham was inevitably exposed. In her own recent memoir of early feminist activism in the United States, Susan Brownmiller records the intense pressures on these early stars. Publishers wanted them to write \"big books\", or the same big book over and over again, while other women criticised them for taking all the glory. Rowbotham says now, \"I wasn't good at being an individual star. I just didn't enjoy it. It was a strain living up to others' ideas of what I should be like. By temperament I love watching and observing.\" Dorothy Thompson says \"the marvellous thing about her is that she has never allowed herself to become a celebrity, which would have been easy for someone as intelligent and sparky as she\". Rowbotham remembers \"getting a bit tearful, having a bit of a breakdown, about my own role as an individual. But this collectivity also had a really positive side which offset all the suspicion. It was very confirming to have this sense of connection; it helped you do things you otherwise wouldn't do.\" By the late 70s, feminism was changing. Rowbotham remembers being at a socialist feminist meeting in 1976 \"and someone started talking about careers\". The days of scraping by with a couple of days teaching were finally passing. Politically, feminism was breaking up, or breaking down, depending on your point of view. Lynne Segal, a long-time friend and now professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, London, says \"by the early 1980s, socialist feminism was no longer a sexy subject. It was considered dull. Also, anyone trying to gain an overview of what was happening was declared suspect. The new was particularity, identity and difference, particularly ethnic difference.\" Segal thinks that was an important shift, but that these changes too easily led to a \"sibling war of younger sisters against the old guard, which was kind of ridiculous in relation to Sheila, who has always been on the outside. No one was less a part of the old feminist establishment.\" Rowbotham was always radical, but never a radical feminist. According to her friend John Hoyland, \"she was always very, very tough in her feminism but it was tempered by this enormous heterosexual enthusiasm\". Rowbotham also rejected any essentialist theories about masculinity or patriarchy. \"I was influenced by existentialism, so I resist fixed definitions. When you try and put something into an abstract category, you distort its living reality.\" An avowed sexual libertarian, Rowbotham has never married. There have been, instead, a series of committed but often combustible relationships with significant men of the left. Promise Of A Dream gives a poignant and often hilarious account of her relationship with a young Bob Rowthorn, now professor of economics at Cambridge. Thirty years on, it is not hard to spot the incompatibility of these two young radicals. Rowthorn was a keen athlete, a ferociously abstract and logical thinker, who kept his pencils stacked tidily in a jar. As Rowbotham records, \"he was not at all interested in my obsessive analysing of emotions and relationships\". In the 70s she lived with David Widgery, the socialist GP and writer. Widgery had guest-edited Oz, the hippie underground paper, and, says one friend, \"while Widgery had brought politics to Oz, Sheila was trying to bring cultural and feminist politics to the left. So they met somewhere in the middle.\" Nigel Fountain describes the relationship as \"tempestuous . . . they did feed off each other in terms of ideas, but there were a lot of slammed doors\". When Rowbotham left to have a child by Paul Atkinson, a young community activist, Widgery, says Fountain, was devastated. Friends say he never really forgave her, right up until his sudden death in 1992. Rowbotham says now that she chose to have a child \"with someone who in no way resembled my father, or had his anger\". When her son, Will, was born in 1977, she joined \"a group of women trying to think about their fathers. I had this little baby boy and I felt I had to understand my reaction to my father as an individual if I wasn't to pass on some of those problems to him. I had to get a more balanced relationship in my memory.\" When Will was five, Atkinson got involved with someone else, and Rowbotham lived alone until the mid-90s. She now lives with Derek Clarke, an assistant head and committed trade union and community activist. Will is now 23 and works as a librarian in London. Like many on the left in the 60s, Rowbotham had given up on the Labour Party, largely over Vietnam. But Ken Livingstone's GLC offered a new chance, as she says, \"to resist Thatcherism on a wider, more organised basis\". From 1983 to 1986 she worked at the GLC economic and social policy unit, editing a popular newspaper, Jobs for a Change, with John Hoyland. The GLC, she says, was \"libertarian but practical socialism. It distresses me that it is never talked about seriously but just dismissed with a sneer. We tried to work with people on the ground, community organisers, local groups. And so much has since become common sense, like the idea that people with disabilities should have access to the Tube.\" For her, personally, it was a happy period. \"It was true unalienated labour. I hate getting up in the morning, but I would be up and off to work at six on a Saturday morning. The Tories on the GLC simply couldn't understand this enthusiasm. They even thanked us for our work.\" When the GLC was finally abolished, Rowbotham, supporting her young son, thought she would turn her hand to freelance journalism, \"but by that time, I was a no-no. It just got harder and harder for me in Britain.\" In the late 80s she got RSI: \"I was immobilised for several months and for over a year couldn't handwrite for more than a few minutes. For two years I couldn't type on a computer.\" From the late 80s, searching for income and some political support, Rowbotham began to lecture in Canada and the United States and then did research for what she jokingly calls the \"Global GLC\", the United Nations University based in Helsinki and Maastricht. From this period dates her work on new forms of economic organisation among poor women in non- European countries, Dignity And Daily Bread, and changing patterns of employment in the developing world, Women Encounter Technology. Both books were written with the academic and activist Swasti Mitter, who had read Rowbotham's work in the late 60s but did not meet her until the mid-80s. \"What I learned from Sheila is that truth lies in the detail,\" says Mitter. \"You can talk about the tension between class, race and gender, but you understand it better if you convey it in the context of an individual or a community.\" Mitter believes that while Rowbotham's work was tremendously important in Britain in the 60s and 70s, in the 80s and 90s it was talked about extensively in non-European countries. \"In these places feminism and socialist feminism are not only about body politics but about bread-and-butter issues,\" she says. \"Women in Mexico, India and Malaysia will know about Rowbotham and her writing.\" In many ways, the publication of Promise Of A Dream brings Rowbotham full circle. Politically, she says she sees a lot of similarities between the 60s and now - \"a new Labour government for the first time in a long time, this same uncritical attitude to modernisation, and a complacency about the inequalities of American-style capitalism. Class really does seem the unmentionable.\" She was heartened by the anti-capitalist demonstrations in Seattle. She and her partner joined a sister demonstration in Manchester, but \"it was tiny and they all looked like schoolchildren\". Rowbotham says she finds younger women mysterious and seemingly very confident, but is philosophical rather than disheartened by modern feminism. \"I find a lot of parallels with the 60s, where an unease about gender is expressed in cultural rather than political terms, and there's this laddish belief that we all shared that a woman can do and be anything.

When I first went to Paris aeons ago, the metro was one of the local institutions which made you proud to be British - like the fact that their streets were full of beggars when ours were not. Those dirty, clunking cumbersome trains, those great safety gates which always tried to close on you as you dashed for the platform - how primitive it all seemed. </p> <p>And how far they lagged behind London's fine underground. The one thing they had and we didn't was jolly displays in the main ticket offices where you entered the name of your destination and a lot of lights came on plotting your journey. Today, though our underground is gently improving and even the Northern Line has acquired decent rolling stock and the Jubilee line some dazzling stations, it's the other way round.

This is one centenary celebration which Smallweed would dearly have liked to join. When I first went to Paris aeons ago, the metro was one of the local institutions which made you proud to be British - like the fact that their streets were full of beggars when ours were not. Those dirty, clunking cumbersome trains, those great safety gates which always tried to close on you as you dashed for the platform - how primitive it all seemed. And how far they lagged behind London's fine underground. The one thing they had and we didn't was jolly displays in the main ticket offices where you entered the name of your destination and a lot of lights came on plotting your journey. Today, though our underground is gently improving and even the Northern Line has acquired decent rolling stock and the Jubilee line some dazzling stations, it's the other way round. The metro, in my experience, even boasts better buskers. And even though our underground map was a triumph of innovative design, give me the Paris map every time. One can entertain oneself simply by tracing the routes. How is it that a people so famous for being logical should have evolved such a whacky system of lines?

Each member will receive 250 shares, and someone who is both a saver and a borrower will get 500. A facility will be put in place so people can sell their shares if they wish. </p> <p>B&amp;B's market value has been estimated by Goldman Sachs (the investment bank advising on the flotation) at between \u00a31.75bn and \u00a32.2bn. This translates into windfalls of between \u00a3647 and \u00a3815 per person, with the mid-point between these two \u00a3731. </p> <p>However, this prediction was based on B&amp;B theoretically having been a public company on December 31 1999, and a lot has happened since then. The UK banking sector is a lot less chipper than it was at the end of last year, and the mortgage banks in particular - of which B&amp;B will be one - are seeing their shares take a hammering because of intense competition. </p> <p>Earlier this month, HSBC put the thumb-screws on its rivals when it chopped almost a whole percentage point off its standard variable rate, and new internet banks such as Intelligent Finance are piling on more pressure with aggressively priced mortgage deals. </p> <p>At the same time, the high street banks are coming under pressure from the government to bring out better- value home loans with low charges and much more flexibility, and they are having to fork out huge sums as they attempt to repackage themselves as sexy e-banks. All in all, it's a very tough time for the mortgage banks, with no let-up in sight. </p> <p>A glance at the share prices of some of the leading players confirms this. Halifax this week stood at around 540p-550p. Compare this with just nine months ago, when they topped 800p, or the 774.5p they opened at on the day of its flotation in June 1997. </p> <p>The Woolwich was this week at around 260p, not far above its all-time low, and it's a similar story with Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester, which early this week were languishing at around 300p and 490p respectively. </p> <p>So what does all this have to do with my B&amp;B shares, you might ask. Well, some analysts say these very tough conditions could reduce B&amp;B's value to between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a31.8bn, which could mean windfalls as low as \u00a3481. </p> <p>As for whether you should hold on to the shares or sell them, this of course depends on your individual circumstances and what happens in the coming months, but the view of some experts is that selling early could be the wise move. </p> <p>Justin Urquhart Stewart at Barclays Stockbrokers says that if the B&amp;B windfall will be the only shares you own, his advice would probably be to sell them and use the money to buy a collective investment such as a unit trust, where your money is pooled with that of lots of other people and invested in a broad spread of companies. </p> <p>B&amp;B's stated aim is to become \"the leading independent national distributor of financial and property services\", but it is still very much tagged as a mortgage business. Someone may well buy B&amp;B eventually, \"but in the meantime you could have wasted an awful lot of other opportunities to make money,\" adds Mr Urquhart Stewart. </p> <p>Many observers were surprised at just how many mortgage customers voted for conversion bearing in mind that B&amp;B said only last year that if it becomes a bank it will have to raise home loan rates. </p> <p>In fact, this process has already started. In April last year, the month that B&amp;B lost the original vote over whether it should convert, its standard variable mortgage rate was 6.60%, only slightly higher than that of Nationwide building society (6.45%), while the banks were typically charging around 7%. Now, with the conversion process under way, B&amp;B is charging 7.64% - well above the Nationwide's 7.29% rate and a lot nearer to the Halifax's 7.74% rate. </p> <p>One City banking analyst says: \"B&amp;B have already been moving away from the general level of rates paid by mutuals in anticipation of the need to increase profits to pay dividends to future shareholders.\" </p> <p>Clearly spotting an oppor tunity to grab some disaffected B&amp;B borrowers, Yorkshire building society this week launched a \"mutual mortgage\", which is guaranteed to be 1% below the B&amp;B variable mortgage rate for two years. That means a guaranteed saving of \u00a31,400 over two years for a typical \u00a370,000 interest-only borrower, it claims. </p> <p>The Yorkshire has structured the mortgage so that B&amp;B borrowers can move all but \u00a31,000 of their home loan immediately, so they can start saving on their mortgage payments now, but won't miss out on their windfall.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This week's Bradford &amp; Bingley vote result shows that no matter how much the pro-mutuality campaigners bang on about people being better-off with a building society, members find it difficult to resist the lure of the lucre. </p> <p>It was revealed this week that Stephen Major, the man who took on B&amp;B and won, has now turned his sights on the biggest society of them all, the Nationwide. So it's a vitally important time for the sector to think of new ways of rewarding customer loyalty and showing them that mutuality really does pay.</p> <p>To this end, the Skipton, the UK's seventh-largest building society, this week unveiled a \"ground-breaking\" scheme which will see 290,000 of its members receiving either extra interest on their savings or a reduction in their September mortgage payment worth up to \u00a3500.</p> <p>The reason for this sudden fit of generosity - apart from its keenness to keep its customers sweet, of course - is that it has notched up record profits this year, fuelled in part by the \u00a382m sale two months ago of its share-dealing subsidiary Dealwise.</p> <p>As a result, it has decided to hand back \u00a350m of this money to long-term customers who were members on September 30 1996 - the date when it acquired Dealwise.</p> <p>The Skipton isn't putting cash straight into people's hands - what it has decided to do is award the money to members in the form of an \"interest credit\".</p> <p>What this means is that if you are a saver you will re ceive an extra interest payment of between \u00a35 and \u00a3500, depending on how much was in your account(s) on April 30 this year.</p> <p>If you are an eligible mortgage customer you will get a credit of up to \u00a3500, which you can either use to reduce your September mortgage repayment or treat as a lump sum off the loan. If you are both a borrower and a saver you will receive up to \u00a31,000.</p> <p>In the case of savers, the credit they get will be 4% of the total amount in their account(s). So if you had \u00a3125 or less saved on April 30 you will only get \u00a35, but if you had total balances of \u00a35,000 you'll get \u00a3200, and if you had \u00a312,500 or more stashed away you will get the maximum \u00a3500.</p> <p>The credit will be paid into people's accounts at the same time as their normal interest is paid. So if you've got an account where interest is paid annually on December 31, that's when you will get it.</p> <p>Mortgage customers will get an interest credit amounting to 0.4% of the balance of their mortgage account on April 30. So if you had a mortgage balance of \u00a350,000 on that date you'll get a credit of \u00a3200, while if it was \u00a3125,000 or more you will receive the maximum \u00a3500.</p> <p>If your monthly mortgage payment is \u00a3500, say, and you're awarded a credit of \u00a3300, that means that in September you could just pay \u00a3200 if you wish. However, the Skipton says a borrower in that situation may wish to consider treating the \u00a3300 credit as a capital repayment. So is this a one-off payout or could there be more cash in the pipeline? That depends on what happens in the coming months and years.</p> <p>The Skipton still has eight subsidiary companies but currently has no plans to sell any of these in the future. However, if one of these companies was to deliver particularly good profits, it may be that some of this can be handed back to members in the same way.</p> <p>Members will receive letters within the next few days informing them if they have qualified for an interest credit and if so, how much they will get. There is also an information hotline, tel: 01756-705-002.</p>",

So it's a vitally important time for the sector to think of new ways of rewarding customer loyalty and showing them that mutuality really does pay. To this end, the Skipton, the UK's seventh-largest building society, this week unveiled a \"ground-breaking\" scheme which will see 290,000 of its members receiving either extra interest on their savings or a reduction in their September mortgage payment worth up to \u00a3500. The reason for this sudden fit of generosity - apart from its keenness to keep its customers sweet, of course - is that it has notched up record profits this year, fuelled in part by the \u00a382m sale two months ago of its share-dealing subsidiary Dealwise. As a result, it has decided to hand back \u00a350m of this money to long-term customers who were members on September 30 1996 - the date when it acquired Dealwise. The Skipton isn't putting cash straight into people's hands - what it has decided to do is award the money to members in the form of an \"interest credit\". What this means is that if you are a saver you will re ceive an extra interest payment of between \u00a35 and \u00a3500, depending on how much was in your account(s) on April 30 this year. If you are an eligible mortgage customer you will get a credit of up to \u00a3500, which you can either use to reduce your September mortgage repayment or treat as a lump sum off the loan. If you are both a borrower and a saver you will receive up to \u00a31,000. In the case of savers, the credit they get will be 4% of the total amount in their account(s). So if you had \u00a3125 or less saved on April 30 you will only get \u00a35, but if you had total balances of \u00a35,000 you'll get \u00a3200, and if you had \u00a312,500 or more stashed away you will get the maximum \u00a3500. The credit will be paid into people's accounts at the same time as their normal interest is paid. So if you've got an account where interest is paid annually on December 31, that's when you will get it. Mortgage customers will get an interest credit amounting to 0.4% of the balance of their mortgage account on April 30. So if you had a mortgage balance of \u00a350,000 on that date you'll get a credit of \u00a3200, while if it was \u00a3125,000 or more you will receive the maximum \u00a3500. If your monthly mortgage payment is \u00a3500, say, and you're awarded a credit of \u00a3300, that means that in September you could just pay \u00a3200 if you wish. However, the Skipton says a borrower in that situation may wish to consider treating the \u00a3300 credit as a capital repayment. So is this a one-off payout or could there be more cash in the pipeline? That depends on what happens in the coming months and years. The Skipton still has eight subsidiary companies but currently has no plans to sell any of these in the future. However, if one of these companies was to deliver particularly good profits, it may be that some of this can be handed back to members in the same way. Members will receive letters within the next few days informing them if they have qualified for an interest credit and if so, how much they will get. There is also an information hotline, tel: 01756-705-002.",

While employers training their own staff achieve the highest standards of provision, many of the worst providers are small private training companies specialising in business admin and care. Chief inspector David Sherlock found that such outfits offer trainees to employers as extra pair of hands, rather than putting the learning needs of the trainees first. More worryingly, few providers carry out initial assessment of key skills and very few staff are qualified to train in, or assess key skills. </p> <p>The Institute for Employment Studies has produced a first in-depth analysis of the practical operation of internal job markets. Many major UK employers have moved to advertising internal job vacancies to the workforce which is welcomed by employees and line managers as a potentially fairer and more open way of filling vacancies. The trouble is that employees suspect that most managers pay lip service to the idea but have already decided who they want to appoint - typically someone whom they can manipulate to serve their personal, rather than organisational, agenda. </p> <p>Copies of the report Free, Fair and Efficient is available by calling 01476 541080. </p>",

More than half of the respondents to the survey were considering a job move soon. Dr Holbeche says \" What modern employees want is support in making lateral moves possible. Line managers are generally seen as uncaring, except when it comes to their own promotion.\" Copies of the report, priced \u00a350, available from Pauline Hinds, tel 01293 854065. The annual report of the chief inspector of the Training Standards Council, the government funded regulator for work-based training in England, makes dismal reading. While employers training their own staff achieve the highest standards of provision, many of the worst providers are small private training companies specialising in business admin and care. Chief inspector David Sherlock found that such outfits offer trainees to employers as extra pair of hands, rather than putting the learning needs of the trainees first. More worryingly, few providers carry out initial assessment of key skills and very few staff are qualified to train in, or assess key skills. The Institute for Employment Studies has produced a first in-depth analysis of the practical operation of internal job markets. Many major UK employers have moved to advertising internal job vacancies to the workforce which is welcomed by employees and line managers as a potentially fairer and more open way of filling vacancies. The trouble is that employees suspect that most managers pay lip service to the idea but have already decided who they want to appoint - typically someone whom they can manipulate to serve their personal, rather than organisational, agenda.

Its history is grotesque. Under the weight of adverse criticism in Pravda (directed at his opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk), Shostakovich withdrew the score in 1936, when the symphony was in rehearsal, and remained fiercely dismissive of the work until 1961, when a thaw in artistic policy permitted the first performance. Thereafter, he claimed that is was a far finer piece than many he had written, and that it depicted the fetid atmosphere of Russia when Stalin's purges were at their worst. Opening the Proms' Shostakovich retrospective, Vassily Sinaisky and the BBC Philharmonic allowed us to experience the music's overwhelming ability to shock. Nothing in it is quite what you expect. You anticipate harmonic extremism, but its brutality derives from the unremitting garishness of its sonorities rather than from extended dissonance. The real nightmare lies in its monstrosity and in its debt to Mahler. Shostakovich uses a Strauss-sized orchestra including nine horns, six flutes and nine percussionists - a line-up that the Soviet Union of 1936 would inevitably have seen as western and decadent. The Mahlerian legacy is apparent in the protracted funeral marches, the raucously false hurdy-gurdy jollity, the trickling celesta solo which brings the symphony to its close. Mahler is, of course, the chronicler of imperial decline, the describer of the fag end of absolute monarchy, and the symphony's inference - that one form of dreadful autocracy has been replaced by another - could not be more obvious.</p> <p>Sinaisky stares unblinkingly into its heart of darkness and spares you nothing, while the BBC Philharmonic, on peak form, seems to wrench the guts out of the piece with shattering force. Sinaisky is undoubtedly a great Shostakovich conductor, but he's not happy when it comes to Brahms. The Violin Concerto was the symphony's companion piece, and Sinaisky, unsure whether to stress its classical rigour or its romantic passion, hovers in the middle to muddled effect.</p> <p>The orchestral playing was less assured too, so the performance became effectively a one-woman show for the soloist, the great Viktoria Mullova. Beautiful as always, she mesmerised with the fierce tenderness of her playing, took expressive risks at every turn, and brought the house down in the process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When did you first become a manager? In 1978 when I took charge of a polyester manufacturing unit. What has been your best moment in management? Recognising the power of positive reinforcement - it's a simple thing, but I've seen it have great impact on those around me. What was your greatest mistake? Not being four inches taller - I would have made a much better rugby player. Which deal would you most like to have done? Persuading people to pay good money for a bottle of water! What do you find most annoying in your staff? Not being positive about the situation they find themselves in. I'm a great believer in positive thinking. Does your organisation have a glass ceiling? No, the challenge is to make sure that everyone can make the most of their capabilities. What management wisdom is most overrated? Thriving on chaos - it's just an excuse for bad organisation skills. What will be the big business issue of the next decade? E-communication overload. It's impossible to imagine a world without email now, isn't it? What one lesson would you pass on to trainee managers? Take an interest in activities outside your particular area of responsibility. You never know when it may come in useful and in my experience it always does. Which management guru do you believe in? Joe Juran, Project by Project And No Other Way. Who is your management hero? Jack Welch, chief executive of General Electric. Who is your favourite politician? My wife - I'm amazed she hasn't been snapped up by Downing Street yet! What phrase or saying do you most overuse? \"Well done\", but I'm not sure that you can overuse it. It comes back to the positive reinforcement theory. Apart from your family, what else makes you happiest in life? Having a screwdriver in one hand and a spanner in the other. What annoys you most? People who think they can get away with dumping their rubbish at the side of the road. How do you relax? Running through the woods with our dog. Apart from keeping me healthy, it gives me some valuable thinking time. What was your last cultural experience? Listening to the England rugby team beating South Africa in Bloemfontain. What is your favourite city? Melbourne. Do you have a favourite website? Ixquick is a great metasearch engine. What is your greatest regret? Not being fluent in French. What would you really like to have been? A surgeon. Being able to make a real difference to people's lives must be very rewarding.",

The involvement of a social landlord is likely to make buyers feel protected from the ups and downs of the property market. However, when it comes to purchasing a home, even a 50% share, buyers should apply the same criteria as they would to a conventional purchase.

One-bedroom flats are also the properties that shoot up in value when the market is booming and plummet when prices fall. </p> <p>One former homeowner who bought through shared ownership is sceptical about how many participants benefit from improving their property. \"You can spend \u00a35,000 doing up a one-bedroom flat bought for \u00a3100,000 to increase its value by \u00a38,000. </p> <p>\"When the flat is sold the housing association picks up half of the value, which is \u00a354,000.

Feelings of inadequacy, anxiety and copious amounts of stress an advantage. Applications to www.iloathmyjob.com/</p> <p>So goes the blurb to a new book by career consultant Nick Williams. And it will strike a serious chord with those unhappy in their job and who are looking for a change. </p> <p>The idea that we should all know what we want to do for the rest of our lives before the age of 20 is a myth. A recent international job satisfaction survey, conducted by the University of Warwick, revealed that British workers are among the most unhappy in the developed world. Heart attacks are most likely to happen on a Monday morning -either on the way to, or on arrival at, work. </p> <p>But there is still very little help for those who find themselves floundering about the appointment section of papers. It is easy to identify that you are unhappy in your current job, but so much more difficult to identify how to make a change and which new direction to take. </p> <p>Mr Williams, whose book The 12 Principles of the Work We Were Born To Do is published in September, says the need for change - in the past seen as a symptom of a mid-life crisis - is hitting people much earlier now. \"I joke that the mid-life crisis is coming much sooner these days, but in reality there is so much more change in people's lives anyway. Often people in their late 20s will start to feel unhappy, and it is also very common in people about to turn 40,\" he says. </p> <p>There is not much help available to people who find themselves in this position and there are so many choices to be made. Changers have to decide if they want a single job or a portfolio of careers, whether they wish to remain in the UK or start looking abroad, and if they would be happier being their own boss. </p> <p>Most careers advice is aimed at school or college leavers, or is high-level outplacing, which is prohibitively expensive and generally unsuitable for people looking for a complete shift in lifestyle - outplacement agencies tend to find more of the same sort of job. </p> <p>Other options are seeing a career consultant, who will use a combination of psychometric testing and an interview with an occupational psychologist to indicate which career would be most suitable for you, and going to a more counselling-based service or talking to your local careers service. I test-drove all three (below) and despite the steep price, would recommend full counselling. </p> <p>Even if you decide to use one of the above, it would be useful to think about what makes you happy in life, and what skills you would be able to offer an employer. It is not sufficient knowing that you could do a job, you need to either prove it, or demonstrate that you are worth the risk. </p> <p>Although career change is generally about emotional issues, there are practical issues to take into account. If you quit your job before finding another, you will need to have money saved, or a short-term way of making cash. This will also mean you are not paying National Insurance and pension contributions, which may have long-term implications. </p> <p>Mr Williams advises that if you can ease yourself into the change, it will be less stressful. \"If you are able to move to four days a week at your current job and perhaps just do one day in your new job, this will be easier. It is also more manageable financially.\" </p> <p>James Gladwin, an outplacement professional, adds that it is not worth the expense of using a professional CV writer. \"All too often the product from the professional CV writer is a bland document which is instantly recognisable as coming from a particular stable,\" he says. </p> <p>A final piece of advice, from careers consultant Jo Ouston: the cycle of spotting a job, applying, going for interview and then being accepted or rejected will take about 10 weeks. Keep this process fluid - in other words apply for one job each week -and do not jump for the first position offered. </p> <p>\u0095 Nick Williams runs day-long workshops around the country priced around \u00a370.

The consultation lasted for an hour. </p> <p>I was initially sceptical about the kind of service that would be offered. I had preconceptions about how appropriate the advice would be for me, a professional of five years' standing, especially when, having mentioned that I would like to work with people, the consultant suggested I tried social work. This felt like a knee-jerk reaction and the pointing to a random career on the list of \"people\" jobs. </p> <p>But I was wrong. Omar, my consultant, really listened to me and quickly summed up my particular situation. In the end, the hour turned into more of an emotional counselling session, which was in tune with what I needed. </p> <p>He recognised that I had the capabilities to identify my own strengths and weaknesses and could consequently identify the type of job which would suit me, and that I had the skills to write a CV and follow through the application process. </p> <p>What I needed was reassurance that I had the right to devote the time to myself which making a change would take. He was more guru than adviser. </p> <p>But he did balance this with some pragmatic assistance. He listed the general areas which were of interest to me with the promise to do some more research on specialist databases. He also studied the sample CV I had brought with me and suggested some changes. </p> <p>A couple of weeks later I was surprised to receive through the post not only a letter of encouragement, but also a list of courses which would be relevant for retraining and a new version of my CV, plus a copy on floppy disk. His letter urged me to look into the courses and to contact him again when I needed more help. </p> <p>Had I wanted a knowledge-economy type career, or a complete change in working patterns, I am not convinced that Omar would have had access to sufficiently detailed information to help me. Time was also limited, although a follow-up visit would have helped. I also found it a little difficult to pour out my heart in the corner of Ladbroke Grove library. </p> <p>However, considering the service was free and the highly pastoral nature of the consultation, I would recommend this as a first step in finding a new career. </p> <p><strong> The careers counsellor</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Cost: \u00a31,000-plus.

I feared the session, at \u00a3100 a hour plus VAT, with a minimum booking of around eight hours split over two separate days, might just be expensive aura polishing. </p> <p>In fact, Jo is a warm, charismatic and deeply experienced professional - had I been writing her CV I would have stressed her excellent communication skills which centre on the telling of stories. I found this approach very encouraging and aspirational. She emphasised that she teaches people the skills to identify their own path, rather than finding it for them. </p> <p>Despite 20 years in the business, she clearly still finds people's employment and life choices fascinating. Very few people are motivated by money to change career, she told me, unless they are not earning enough for the basics of living or they feel their pay level is unfair in comparison with that of their peers. The service is to tally personalised and she has a number of tests and games which match the client's particular needs. With me she quickly identified that what was needed was an analysis of my core values to recognise what I would really need from a job. This entailed my telling her my life story, from which she selected key words. </p> <p>These I could select as significant, or reject as not, as I pleased (of course, they were all my own words in the first place, but out of context, some of them lost their pertinence). This was then used as a basis for drawing out what is important to me, what I fear, what excites me and what fundamentals need to be in place to make me happy. The answers were not only spot on, but also they revealed aspects of myself of which I had been aware, but had not managed to articulate. </p> <p>It felt much less prescriptive than the session with the occupational psychologist and left me feeling empowered to make my own choice. I also felt that the answers took into account the unique nature of an individual's personality rather than block-fitting me into a pre-set space. </p> <p>Most clients would be encouraged to opt for a follow-up session when booking the initial one and this would cover how to go about entering the career field identified in the first consultation. This includes presentation training and interview technique as well as CV writing. </p> <p>It is expensive.

One, a recently divorced woman who had always worked in administration for local government, wanted a complete change and was thinking about working as a therapist. The other was a City trader who wanted out, but was not sure what to. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and I got the impression that all the employees of CA strongly believed in the benefits of their service. I commented that the price may be a little high for some people. The response - that it was not unreasonable for the amount of professional time on a one-to-one basis it bought and that it if it steers you towards a happy career path, it is money well spent - seemed reasonable. </p> <p>The tests were enjoyable.

Feelings of inadequacy, anxiety and copious amounts of stress an advantage. Applications to www.iloathmyjob.com/ So goes the blurb to a new book by career consultant Nick Williams. And it will strike a serious chord with those unhappy in their job and who are looking for a change. The idea that we should all know what we want to do for the rest of our lives before the age of 20 is a myth. A recent international job satisfaction survey, conducted by the University of Warwick, revealed that British workers are among the most unhappy in the developed world. Heart attacks are most likely to happen on a Monday morning -either on the way to, or on arrival at, work. But there is still very little help for those who find themselves floundering about the appointment section of papers. It is easy to identify that you are unhappy in your current job, but so much more difficult to identify how to make a change and which new direction to take. Mr Williams, whose book The 12 Principles of the Work We Were Born To Do is published in September, says the need for change - in the past seen as a symptom of a mid-life crisis - is hitting people much earlier now. \"I joke that the mid-life crisis is coming much sooner these days, but in reality there is so much more change in people's lives anyway.

      "body": "<p>A few days before the launch of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the children's book buyer at the Palmers Green Bookshop in North London, Frances Crawley, was able to tell me that the fourth J.K. Rowling book would be sold at \u00a312.99, two pounds less than the recommended price of \u00a314.99. At Waterstone's Piccadilly, the biggest bookshop in Europe, the response was: \"We don't know: we're waiting to hear from head office.\" </p> <p>Independence creates flexibility and autonomy but at the same time, if you choose to go it alone, the market is tough. If the out-of-town supermarkets rang the death knell for local shops, the arrival of bookstore chains hastened closing sales for many independent booksellers. </p> <p>Yet while some people pointed out that corner shops selling shrivelled lettuces and past-their-best eggs weren't really providing what modern shoppers wanted, so it went with the critics of fusty booksellers - they just hadn't moved with the times. And just as farmers markets and specialist retailers are popping up all over the place; in the book buying market - where new titles are dramatically discounted, can be ordered on the internet or hurled into your supermarket trolley - there is still room for switched-on, independent booksellers. </p> <p>\"People will get bored of the uniformity of seeing a Starbucks, a Pret A Manger or a Borders on every street corner and will probably choose to go back to somewhere that looks more like a bookshop and doesn't feel like a superstore,\" says Phil Griffiths, who set up Metropolitan Books in Exmouth Market, London, a location that he describes as \"a well kept secret: a kind of dead place between Islington and the City\". </p> <p>Metropolitan Books opened three days before Christmas 1998 and Phil Griffiths, who learned his craft at Muswell Hill Bookshop and Islington Bookshop, is finding that a local loyalty is developing. \"Even if a Books Etc were to open in Clerkenwell, I'm sure there would still be enough people who would think: 'actually, I'll still carry on supporting the independent',\" he says. </p> <p>Ironically, for someone who \"doesn't really like the chain store approach\", Metropolitan Books is slap bang next to Starbucks, and Pizza Express is on its way. An organic farmers market could be starting up and more people are moving into the area. Phil Griffiths feels confident, as \"things are heading in the right direction\". </p> <p>The joy of running your own bookshop, he explains, is that you get to buy your own books. \"In the big chains, buying is being done centrally so booksellers are effectively just unpacking and shelving books. When that happens, the fun part of the job has gone.\" </p> <p>At Metropolitan Books, the fun part means that as a shopper, you get a good whack of Anne Tyler, Alice Munro and Raymond Carver with Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life playing in the background. </p> <p>While Phil Griffiths works 10-7 every day apart from Sunday and brings his lunch into work as he can't leave the shop, he says that it's all part of a long term goal. After three years he hopes to get someone to help and will then look for a second shop, which could be in Paris, New York or Hackney. </p> <p>But even the mightiest are struggling. Waterstone's - which hit the headlines when it sacked Robert Topping, the manager of its Deansgate branch in Manchester, for refusing to toe the line on stock policies -has failed to get to grips with the internet, as has WH Smith. And Amazon, possibly one of the best known internet brands, which has never made a profit, has recently seen its share value take a nosedive. </p> <p>Which makes the story of Country Bookshop at Hassop Station, Bakewell, Derbyshire, all the more astounding, and proves the original point of the so-called level playing field of the internet. Geraldine Rose and Sridhar Gowda set up <a href=\"http://www.countrybookshop.co.uk\">www.countrybookshop.co.uk</a> and launched a website last March with 1m titles. </p> <p>Everything is done in-house, from designing the website to the \"fulfilment\" (the selecting, wrapping and sending bit). Their team has grown from eight people this time last year to 25, including website designers, programmers, and customer service people. Nothing is outsourced and it's all integrated. </p> <p>The website is plain and simple, has no advertising and offers free delivery within the UK. It came second in the DTI e-commerce awards this month and countrybookshop.co.uk was the only bookseller in the Sunday Times e-league of Europe's top 100 internet businesses, at 41. In terms of internet traffic, according to Alexa, the web navigation tool which tracks the visits of its users, countrybookshop.co.uk overtook WH Smith, Waterstone's, Alphabetstreet and Blackwells and is hot on the heels of bol.com. Their turnover has quadrupled to more than \u00a31m in one year. How have they managed it? </p> <p>\"If you understand new media, you can cut costs. The web needs people who are flexible and can adapt to changes quickly,\" explains Sridhar Gowda. \"With some of the other book shops, like Waterstones, they outsource the internet side of their business and although they are good with their bookshops, the web is new to them: they don't understand it.\" </p> <p>\"And we're lucky because around the Peak District, within one hour's drive, lives half the population of the UK,\" says Geraldine Rose, who explains that many of the people they have employed locally are pleased that they can do webby jobs without needing to leave the part of the country they love to move to London. </p> <p>\"We didn't plan it, but it's happened this way,\" says Mr Gowda. As for the shop in Bakewell, it's becoming a focal point in the community. </p> <p>\"We're trying to make the shop into a cultural and literary centre,\" explains Mr Gowda. The design of the website has proved so popular that now other booksellers are approaching them to ask for help with their own internet businesses, which has prompted Ms Rose and Mr Gowda to develop another arm to their business, the web design company: Inamaste. </p> <p>Diversification, or specialisation, is key to keeping an independent bookselling business alive, believes Martin Grindley, president of the Booksellers Association, and owner of Browsers Books in Woodbridge, Suffolk (pictured above). </p> <p>\"But some people think that it's easy to run a bookshop after doing something else.

      "bodyText": "A few days before the launch of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the children's book buyer at the Palmers Green Bookshop in North London, Frances Crawley, was able to tell me that the fourth J.K. Rowling book would be sold at \u00a312.99, two pounds less than the recommended price of \u00a314.99. At Waterstone's Piccadilly, the biggest bookshop in Europe, the response was: \"We don't know: we're waiting to hear from head office.\" Independence creates flexibility and autonomy but at the same time, if you choose to go it alone, the market is tough. If the out-of-town supermarkets rang the death knell for local shops, the arrival of bookstore chains hastened closing sales for many independent booksellers. Yet while some people pointed out that corner shops selling shrivelled lettuces and past-their-best eggs weren't really providing what modern shoppers wanted, so it went with the critics of fusty booksellers - they just hadn't moved with the times. And just as farmers markets and specialist retailers are popping up all over the place; in the book buying market - where new titles are dramatically discounted, can be ordered on the internet or hurled into your supermarket trolley - there is still room for switched-on, independent booksellers. \"People will get bored of the uniformity of seeing a Starbucks, a Pret A Manger or a Borders on every street corner and will probably choose to go back to somewhere that looks more like a bookshop and doesn't feel like a superstore,\" says Phil Griffiths, who set up Metropolitan Books in Exmouth Market, London, a location that he describes as \"a well kept secret: a kind of dead place between Islington and the City\". Metropolitan Books opened three days before Christmas 1998 and Phil Griffiths, who learned his craft at Muswell Hill Bookshop and Islington Bookshop, is finding that a local loyalty is developing. \"Even if a Books Etc were to open in Clerkenwell, I'm sure there would still be enough people who would think: 'actually, I'll still carry on supporting the independent',\" he says. Ironically, for someone who \"doesn't really like the chain store approach\", Metropolitan Books is slap bang next to Starbucks, and Pizza Express is on its way. An organic farmers market could be starting up and more people are moving into the area. Phil Griffiths feels confident, as \"things are heading in the right direction\". The joy of running your own bookshop, he explains, is that you get to buy your own books. \"In the big chains, buying is being done centrally so booksellers are effectively just unpacking and shelving books. When that happens, the fun part of the job has gone.\" At Metropolitan Books, the fun part means that as a shopper, you get a good whack of Anne Tyler, Alice Munro and Raymond Carver with Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life playing in the background. While Phil Griffiths works 10-7 every day apart from Sunday and brings his lunch into work as he can't leave the shop, he says that it's all part of a long term goal. After three years he hopes to get someone to help and will then look for a second shop, which could be in Paris, New York or Hackney. But even the mightiest are struggling. Waterstone's - which hit the headlines when it sacked Robert Topping, the manager of its Deansgate branch in Manchester, for refusing to toe the line on stock policies -has failed to get to grips with the internet, as has WH Smith. And Amazon, possibly one of the best known internet brands, which has never made a profit, has recently seen its share value take a nosedive. Which makes the story of Country Bookshop at Hassop Station, Bakewell, Derbyshire, all the more astounding, and proves the original point of the so-called level playing field of the internet. Geraldine Rose and Sridhar Gowda set up www.countrybookshop.co.uk and launched a website last March with 1m titles. Everything is done in-house, from designing the website to the \"fulfilment\" (the selecting, wrapping and sending bit). Their team has grown from eight people this time last year to 25, including website designers, programmers, and customer service people. Nothing is outsourced and it's all integrated. The website is plain and simple, has no advertising and offers free delivery within the UK. It came second in the DTI e-commerce awards this month and countrybookshop.co.uk was the only bookseller in the Sunday Times e-league of Europe's top 100 internet businesses, at 41. In terms of internet traffic, according to Alexa, the web navigation tool which tracks the visits of its users, countrybookshop.co.uk overtook WH Smith, Waterstone's, Alphabetstreet and Blackwells and is hot on the heels of bol.com. Their turnover has quadrupled to more than \u00a31m in one year. How have they managed it? \"If you understand new media, you can cut costs. The web needs people who are flexible and can adapt to changes quickly,\" explains Sridhar Gowda. \"With some of the other book shops, like Waterstones, they outsource the internet side of their business and although they are good with their bookshops, the web is new to them: they don't understand it.\" \"And we're lucky because around the Peak District, within one hour's drive, lives half the population of the UK,\" says Geraldine Rose, who explains that many of the people they have employed locally are pleased that they can do webby jobs without needing to leave the part of the country they love to move to London. \"We didn't plan it, but it's happened this way,\" says Mr Gowda. As for the shop in Bakewell, it's becoming a focal point in the community. \"We're trying to make the shop into a cultural and literary centre,\" explains Mr Gowda. The design of the website has proved so popular that now other booksellers are approaching them to ask for help with their own internet businesses, which has prompted Ms Rose and Mr Gowda to develop another arm to their business, the web design company: Inamaste. Diversification, or specialisation, is key to keeping an independent bookselling business alive, believes Martin Grindley, president of the Booksellers Association, and owner of Browsers Books in Woodbridge, Suffolk (pictured above). \"But some people think that it's easy to run a bookshop after doing something else. They've got a bit of cash and they buy a bookshop, thinking they're only going to do it for a few years. You've got to invest.\" Running a bookshop is on a par with dreams of opening a cafe, and indeed, some people do both: in Jane Green's novel Bookends, friends set up business together, and Mr Grindley has done just that in Browsers. \"You don't want the old English country house environment,\" he claims. \"You go into bookshops and you get the impression that the booksellers don't get out much.\" Philippe Starck tables and Arne Jacobsen chairs make a statement in Woodbridge, a market town which seems to have embraced Browsers, and you can eat cakes made from recipes in Mary Berry's and Joceline Dimbleby's books, after which, of course, you're tempted to buy the books. In addition to Browsers, Mr Grindley has set up www.lostforwords.com, which asks what you're into then makes helpful suggestions about what you might fancy reading. \"If you're going to be independent, be blatantly independent,\" he adds. \"Don't try to copy the chains.\" He should know, as he learned the hard way, a long time ago, when Ottaker's opened in Brentwood, forcing him out of business, long before he bandied around expressions such as footfall and retail zeitgeist. Yet however different you need to be, as a bookseller, you might still want to attract the big names to your small store. In the Palmers Green Bookshop, which opened in October last year, Frances Crawley is getting ready to dispense coloured lemonade for the Potter City in Palmers Green event.

Better still, remember cigarette cards? The cards of sportsmen, soldiers, shipping, trains, and theatrical figures that used to come in cigarette packets. They seemed to have disappeared altogether as smoking has become frowned upon. </p> <p>Both are popular among collectors though, and have a devoted band of followers. They remain affordable although prices have risen in the past 10 years, sometimes quite sharply, and seem set to continue to do so. </p> <p>An auction last week at Phillips in London, with more than 400 lots of series, groups and individual cigarette cards and postcards, was very well attended. Prices ranged from around \u00a350 for various sets, to hundreds of pounds. </p> <p>David Stuckey, the editor and publisher of Card Times, a monthly aimed at cigarette card collectors, says: \"We have about 3,000 subscribers and we are growing. They are predominantly male and, how I shall put it, usually over 40 years old. They are people with a little bit of disposable income who want to revisit the habits of their youth. Not smoking, but collecting. </p> <p>\"Hardly a month goes by without three or four fairs or auctions somewhere and there is a network of clubs.\" </p> <p>Cigarette cards are the little pictures that were usually stuffed inside a pack of 10 cigarettes produced by G&amp;O Wills, Players and others. They were a form of advertising or really a loyalty card to ensure that smokers continued with the same brand. They ran in series of 25 to 50 or sometimes a lot more. </p> <p>They were popular in Edwardian times and enjoyed a golden age from the 20s to the onset of the second world war, when they were largely discontinued to help the war effort. They straggled on into the 50s but not in any great numbers. Carreras, the cigar company, produced them until a year ago. </p> <p>Picture cards could also be found in boxes of Brooke Bond tea but the company has stopped the practice. So some cards have a rarity value. </p> <p>Even so, you can get individual cards for \u00a35 with sets of up to 50 for around \u00a340 to \u00a350 if they are in good condition. In the Phillips sale an accumulation of 90 sets contained in a small box, including a series of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan (13), hidden beauties (10), football caricatures (6), dogs (14) and cricketers (50), was on offer for \u00a3500 to \u00a3600. </p> <p>Most people in England pursue themes, according to Stuckey, but there was a splurge of American buying four years back. They collect individuals like Marilyn Monroe and the golfer Sam Sneed. Overall, Stuckey estimates, prices have tripled in the past 10 years. </p> <p>Postcards also have their followers. Brian Lund, the publisher of Picture Postcard Monthly, says he sells 4,000 copies a month and reckons each copy is read by 2.6 people, giving him a readership of 10,000 collectors. </p> <p>There are many more postcards around than there are cigarette cards, although prices are roughly similar, ranging from a few pounds to hundreds or, in exceptional cases, four-figure sums. </p> <p>I had thought the most sought-after were the saucy seaside ones, largely because I like them myself. The most famous exponent of these cards, was Donald McGill (1875-1962). But McGill lived a long time and was very prolific. Today, his cards can be picked up for \u00a32 or so. </p> <p>The first postcards in Britain were introduced in 1871. The attraction was not the illustration - they were buff coloured - but the price. They cost a halfpenny, against the letter post which was 1p. In the days before the telephone, let alone email, they became very popular. In 1900 the Post Office lifted the restrictions on illustrations and the Edwardian period became a great age for postcard collecting. Families had albums of actresses, seaside scenes, animated countryside views and the like. </p> <p>It is these Edwardian photographs that are among the most sought after. Brian Lund says at a recent auction in Warwickshire a 1906 photograph of men digging out badgers in Sussex sold for \u00a3103. He says good well-made photographs of coal mines or countryside scenes from this period can realise \u00a3200. </p> <p>Also popular are art deco and art nouveau postcards. Good examples are the work of Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939) and Raphael Kirchner (1876-1917). They can fetch \u00a3100 to \u00a3200. </p> <p>Occasionally a postcard can fetch a four-figure sum. A card sent from the Titantic when it stopped in Cobh (Cork) realised \u00a314,230. But this was very much an exception. Generally the top prices are in the low hundreds but rising. </p> <p>\u0095 Phillips, tel: 020-7629-6602; Card Times, tel: 01695-423470; Picture Postcard Monthly, tel: 0115-937-4079.</p>",

An auction last week at Phillips in London, with more than 400 lots of series, groups and individual cigarette cards and postcards, was very well attended. Prices ranged from around \u00a350 for various sets, to hundreds of pounds. David Stuckey, the editor and publisher of Card Times, a monthly aimed at cigarette card collectors, says: \"We have about 3,000 subscribers and we are growing. They are predominantly male and, how I shall put it, usually over 40 years old. They are people with a little bit of disposable income who want to revisit the habits of their youth. Not smoking, but collecting. \"Hardly a month goes by without three or four fairs or auctions somewhere and there is a network of clubs.\" Cigarette cards are the little pictures that were usually stuffed inside a pack of 10 cigarettes produced by G&amp;O Wills, Players and others. They were a form of advertising or really a loyalty card to ensure that smokers continued with the same brand. They ran in series of 25 to 50 or sometimes a lot more. They were popular in Edwardian times and enjoyed a golden age from the 20s to the onset of the second world war, when they were largely discontinued to help the war effort. They straggled on into the 50s but not in any great numbers. Carreras, the cigar company, produced them until a year ago. Picture cards could also be found in boxes of Brooke Bond tea but the company has stopped the practice. So some cards have a rarity value. Even so, you can get individual cards for \u00a35 with sets of up to 50 for around \u00a340 to \u00a350 if they are in good condition. In the Phillips sale an accumulation of 90 sets contained in a small box, including a series of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan (13), hidden beauties (10), football caricatures (6), dogs (14) and cricketers (50), was on offer for \u00a3500 to \u00a3600. Most people in England pursue themes, according to Stuckey, but there was a splurge of American buying four years back. They collect individuals like Marilyn Monroe and the golfer Sam Sneed. Overall, Stuckey estimates, prices have tripled in the past 10 years. Postcards also have their followers. Brian Lund, the publisher of Picture Postcard Monthly, says he sells 4,000 copies a month and reckons each copy is read by 2.6 people, giving him a readership of 10,000 collectors. There are many more postcards around than there are cigarette cards, although prices are roughly similar, ranging from a few pounds to hundreds or, in exceptional cases, four-figure sums. I had thought the most sought-after were the saucy seaside ones, largely because I like them myself. The most famous exponent of these cards, was Donald McGill (1875-1962). But McGill lived a long time and was very prolific. Today, his cards can be picked up for \u00a32 or so. The first postcards in Britain were introduced in 1871. The attraction was not the illustration - they were buff coloured - but the price. They cost a halfpenny, against the letter post which was 1p. In the days before the telephone, let alone email, they became very popular. In 1900 the Post Office lifted the restrictions on illustrations and the Edwardian period became a great age for postcard collecting. Families had albums of actresses, seaside scenes, animated countryside views and the like. It is these Edwardian photographs that are among the most sought after. Brian Lund says at a recent auction in Warwickshire a 1906 photograph of men digging out badgers in Sussex sold for \u00a3103. He says good well-made photographs of coal mines or countryside scenes from this period can realise \u00a3200. Also popular are art deco and art nouveau postcards. Good examples are the work of Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939) and Raphael Kirchner (1876-1917). They can fetch \u00a3100 to \u00a3200. Occasionally a postcard can fetch a four-figure sum. A card sent from the Titantic when it stopped in Cobh (Cork) realised \u00a314,230. But this was very much an exception. Generally the top prices are in the low hundreds but rising. \u0095 Phillips, tel: 020-7629-6602; Card Times, tel: 01695-423470; Picture Postcard Monthly, tel: 0115-937-4079.",

      "body": "<p>Competitive rates on savings and borrowings plus the back-up of an \"award-winning\" telephone service so you can actually talk to a real person if you need to. That's what First Direct this week claimed it would be offering as it stepped up the internet banking war with the launch of a range of online products. </p> <p>The telephone bank, part of the HSBC group, is attempting to exploit dissatisfaction with some of the stand-alone internet banks, which have come under fire on occasion for poor customer service. </p> <p>Its new firstdirect.com product range includes a current account paying up to 5% gross on credit balances, a savings account paying up to 6% gross, a credit card and personal loans. While the account rates are pretty good, they are not quite as high as some of the purely online offerings - but First Direct is gambling on people accepting a slightly lower rate in return for the reassurance of knowing they can speak to someone 24 hours a day, at no extra charge. </p> <p>Its motto is \"the online bank that customers can talk to\" - a dig at rivals such as First-e, which imposes a \u00a35 charge for transactions conducted by phone which could have been carried out over the net. </p> <p>First Direct's move comes just days after a report which claimed to show that Britain's new internet banks are struggling to win the public's trust. Just 8% of men and 6% of women would choose an online bank over a high street bricks and mortar equivalent, despite all the bad press the traditional banks have received of late, according to brand consultancy Henrion, Ludlow and Schmidt. </p> <p>A contributory factor has undoubtedly been the technical problems which many online banks seem to have suffered. Earlier this month Intelligent Finance (IF), the Halifax's stand-alone internet and telephone bank, was forced to postpone its launch after a glitch almost brought its systems to a halt during the trial run. IF will now go live in August. </p> <p>And last month, Cahoot, Abbey National's internet bank, suffered the embarrassment of having its website out of action for several hours after a surge in demand left its systems unable to cope. </p> <p>Worries about internet security were exacerbated this week when gas and electricity supplier Powergen was forced to contact more than 2,500 of its customers after their banking details were revealed on the company's site. </p> <p>First Direct chief executive Alan Hughes pledged that its customers would benefit from competitive prices, \"but not at the expense of the service they receive\". The bank expects a large proportion of its 1m customers to use its online service. </p> <p>Those who are unable to, or don't want to, use the net, and who stick with telephone-only banking, will have to make do with First Direct's existing non-online rates, which are a lot less attractive. </p> <p>So just how good are the First Direct online rates? The flagship product is a current account paying up to 5% gross - 50 times the 0.1% that the big four banks pay their standard current ac count-holders. However, the interest rates are tiered, and to get 5%, you need to have \u00a35,000 or more sitting in your account. For those with between \u00a31 and \u00a3999 in the account, the rate is just 1%. It rises to 2% for \u00a31,000-\u00a32,499, and 3.5% for \u00a32,500-\u00a34,999. </p> <p>Of the other online banks, Cahoot (<a href=\"http://www.cahoot.com)\">www.cahoot.com)</a> tops the rate table because it pays between 4.5% and 6.5% gross depending on how much is in the account and whether you take a cheque book. IF (<a href=\"http://www.if.com)\">www.if.com)</a> also beats First Direct - it will be paying a flat 5% gross no matter how much is in the account. </p> <p>Similarly, Smile (the Co-op Bank's online offshoot - <a href=\"http://www.smile.co.uk)\">www.smile.co.uk)</a> and First-e (part of the French bank Banque d'Escompte - <a href=\"http://www.first-e.com)\">www.first-e.com)</a> pay 4.75% and 4.88% gross respectively on all credit balances from \u00a31. First Direct's savings account has a rate of 5% gross for balances of between \u00a31 and \u00a34,999, rising to 6% for \u00a3100,000-plus. </p> <p>Again, most of the other online banks beat this. Egg's no-notice account pays 6% gross from \u00a31 upwards - 6.3% if you are happy to operate it entirely over the net. </p> <p>First-e will give you 6.81% gross from \u00a31, though this includes a 0.81% introductory interest bonus which only lasts until September 30.

      "bodyText": "Competitive rates on savings and borrowings plus the back-up of an \"award-winning\" telephone service so you can actually talk to a real person if you need to. That's what First Direct this week claimed it would be offering as it stepped up the internet banking war with the launch of a range of online products. The telephone bank, part of the HSBC group, is attempting to exploit dissatisfaction with some of the stand-alone internet banks, which have come under fire on occasion for poor customer service. Its new firstdirect.com product range includes a current account paying up to 5% gross on credit balances, a savings account paying up to 6% gross, a credit card and personal loans. While the account rates are pretty good, they are not quite as high as some of the purely online offerings - but First Direct is gambling on people accepting a slightly lower rate in return for the reassurance of knowing they can speak to someone 24 hours a day, at no extra charge. Its motto is \"the online bank that customers can talk to\" - a dig at rivals such as First-e, which imposes a \u00a35 charge for transactions conducted by phone which could have been carried out over the net. First Direct's move comes just days after a report which claimed to show that Britain's new internet banks are struggling to win the public's trust. Just 8% of men and 6% of women would choose an online bank over a high street bricks and mortar equivalent, despite all the bad press the traditional banks have received of late, according to brand consultancy Henrion, Ludlow and Schmidt. A contributory factor has undoubtedly been the technical problems which many online banks seem to have suffered. Earlier this month Intelligent Finance (IF), the Halifax's stand-alone internet and telephone bank, was forced to postpone its launch after a glitch almost brought its systems to a halt during the trial run. IF will now go live in August. And last month, Cahoot, Abbey National's internet bank, suffered the embarrassment of having its website out of action for several hours after a surge in demand left its systems unable to cope. Worries about internet security were exacerbated this week when gas and electricity supplier Powergen was forced to contact more than 2,500 of its customers after their banking details were revealed on the company's site. First Direct chief executive Alan Hughes pledged that its customers would benefit from competitive prices, \"but not at the expense of the service they receive\". The bank expects a large proportion of its 1m customers to use its online service. Those who are unable to, or don't want to, use the net, and who stick with telephone-only banking, will have to make do with First Direct's existing non-online rates, which are a lot less attractive. So just how good are the First Direct online rates? The flagship product is a current account paying up to 5% gross - 50 times the 0.1% that the big four banks pay their standard current ac count-holders. However, the interest rates are tiered, and to get 5%, you need to have \u00a35,000 or more sitting in your account. For those with between \u00a31 and \u00a3999 in the account, the rate is just 1%. It rises to 2% for \u00a31,000-\u00a32,499, and 3.5% for \u00a32,500-\u00a34,999. Of the other online banks, Cahoot (www.cahoot.com) tops the rate table because it pays between 4.5% and 6.5% gross depending on how much is in the account and whether you take a cheque book. IF (www.if.com) also beats First Direct - it will be paying a flat 5% gross no matter how much is in the account. Similarly, Smile (the Co-op Bank's online offshoot - www.smile.co.uk) and First-e (part of the French bank Banque d'Escompte - www.first-e.com) pay 4.75% and 4.88% gross respectively on all credit balances from \u00a31. First Direct's savings account has a rate of 5% gross for balances of between \u00a31 and \u00a34,999, rising to 6% for \u00a3100,000-plus. Again, most of the other online banks beat this. Egg's no-notice account pays 6% gross from \u00a31 upwards - 6.3% if you are happy to operate it entirely over the net. First-e will give you 6.81% gross from \u00a31, though this includes a 0.81% introductory interest bonus which only lasts until September 30. IF's savings account will pay 5% gross on \u00a31 to \u00a3999, then 5.65% on \u00a31,000-\u00a39,999, with a top rate of 6.25% for balances of \u00a3100,000 or more. However, some of the best online rates are available from good old building soci eties. Nationwide's e-Savings account is paying a table-topping 7% gross on balances of \u00a31 upwards, but it has to be operated in conjunction with the society's current account. Meanwhile, Newcastle building society's NewcastleNet Savings account pays between 6.6% and 7.1% gross, though minimum investment is \u00a31,000. First Direct's online credit card annual percentage rate is 10.9 APR, and there is a six-month introductory rate on balance transfers of 4.9 APR. Its personal loan rates range from 9.9 APR to 12.9 APR. Egg (www.egg.com) used to be one of the banks that, as First Direct puts it, \"penalise their customers for calling them\", but this week it ditched the \u00a32 charge that customers of its internet savings account and credit card had to pay if they phoned up to request something which could have been done online. Egg originally imposed the charge to deter people from ringing up and has scrapped it after customer feedback showed that \"customers value a combination of internet and telephone servicing in managing their finances\". Egg also this week became the latest player to move into online share-dealing. It has linked up with stockbroker Charles Stanley on the service, which goes live tomorrow and will charge a flat fee of \u00a39.99 per trade. This is one of the cheapest deals around, but there is also a \u00a35 monthly admin fee and you have to have an Egg savings account. Next month Egg will launch a general insurance broking service allowing people to obtain quotes for products such as home and motor cover from a panel of insurers offering \"specially negotiated rates\". And a mortgage broking service, where peo ple can buy home loans from rival lenders, is due to be launched in early autumn. Meanwhile, First-e is hot on its tail - it plans to launch its own online share-dealing and mortgage broking services within the next couple of months, plus own-brand home loans before the end of the year.",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3).

      "body": "<p>With a clip of the heels, a tightening of his facial muscles and a check of his cuffs, Alec Stewart has brushed every speck of dust from his one-day career. </p> <p>Two hundreds in a week have possessed such an orderly, spruced-up feel that had the Gaffer been spotted in Horse Guards Parade, the Queen Mother would have stopped the pageant celebrating her own century, remarked with interest upon that \"smart young man\" and added another salute to the 26 she had already bestowed. </p> <p>Stewart's unbeaten 100 failed by three runs to stop a West Indies victory yesterday, but for that he could be completely exonerated. He received little support in pursuit of 196 for victory in an innings tainted by three run-outs and a bungled finale when England's tail-enders failed to get him on strike. </p> <p>England needed six from 10 balls, with three wickets left, when Stewart reached three figures. Disastrously, he faced only one more ball. Paul Franks, briefly nonplussed over Stewart's understandable urgency for a leg bye, was run out by Mahendra Nagamootoo; Gough infuriatingly stole the strike by calling Stewart for another leg bye and then was yorked first ball; Alan Mullally swung twice when he might have pushed and fell leg before. </p> <p>Chris Gayle was made man of the match, an off-spinner who held his nerve in the final over. There is a presumption that the man of the match must win the game, and it is preferable if he is involved in the shake-up, but there are times when the proviso is crass. </p> <p>A few months ago, England were phasing out Stewart as a one-day player. Add his 101 against Zimbabwe at Edgbaston and he has made as many one-day hundreds since Tuesday as he had in the previous 11 years.

      "bodyText": "With a clip of the heels, a tightening of his facial muscles and a check of his cuffs, Alec Stewart has brushed every speck of dust from his one-day career. Two hundreds in a week have possessed such an orderly, spruced-up feel that had the Gaffer been spotted in Horse Guards Parade, the Queen Mother would have stopped the pageant celebrating her own century, remarked with interest upon that \"smart young man\" and added another salute to the 26 she had already bestowed. Stewart's unbeaten 100 failed by three runs to stop a West Indies victory yesterday, but for that he could be completely exonerated. He received little support in pursuit of 196 for victory in an innings tainted by three run-outs and a bungled finale when England's tail-enders failed to get him on strike. England needed six from 10 balls, with three wickets left, when Stewart reached three figures. Disastrously, he faced only one more ball. Paul Franks, briefly nonplussed over Stewart's understandable urgency for a leg bye, was run out by Mahendra Nagamootoo; Gough infuriatingly stole the strike by calling Stewart for another leg bye and then was yorked first ball; Alan Mullally swung twice when he might have pushed and fell leg before. Chris Gayle was made man of the match, an off-spinner who held his nerve in the final over. There is a presumption that the man of the match must win the game, and it is preferable if he is involved in the shake-up, but there are times when the proviso is crass. A few months ago, England were phasing out Stewart as a one-day player. Add his 101 against Zimbabwe at Edgbaston and he has made as many one-day hundreds since Tuesday as he had in the previous 11 years. Neither match particularly mattered, as England and Zimbabwe had already qualified for tomorrow's NatWest series final, but he does not do \"irrelevant\". He started cagily, happy just to get a bat on it while Marcus Trescothick was briefly clumping the pace bowlers around in what has already become his trademark fashion. There were also a couple of early inside edges, and a reprieve from the TV umpire when a legside catch claimed by the wicketkeeper, Ridley Jacobs, proved to be a half-volley.

There were 46 runs by the 11th over, but Reon King then took three for two in nine balls, having Trescothick and Andrew Flintoff caught at the wicket and bowling Graeme Hick first ball, England's sole contribution to a day of five drag-ons.

(There is even a notice put up in the store appealing for \"hip young gunslingers\" - a reference, surely, to the legendary job advert placed by the NME in the 70s, which got a reply from youngster Julie Burchill.) All the way through the film, from the opening titles to closing credits, there is a passionate, encyclopaedic love of music, combined with a disconcerting sense that this love is a kind of autism or arrested development, a symptom of some poignant deprivation of real love. </p> <p>Cusack is a very plausible Rob, hangdog, clever, alienated, mopey and dopey. Involved in this project from the outset, and credited as co-producer and co-writer, Cusack spends much of the time doing speeches direct to camera, talking to us in his lonely apartment, on the way down the stairs, out on the street and all the way up to the shopfront - speeches taken almost word for word from Hornby's book. The fidelity is a bit too high and the stuff to camera is an uneasy, self-conconscious and pedantic gimmick that Stephen Frears could well have done without, and in fact does without as the film progresses and the action complicates, causing a perceptible improvement in lightness and fluency. </p> <p>The other big departure from realism is Bruce Springsteen making a hefty cameo appearance hanging out in Rob's apartment, giving him advice about life, love and music, like Woody Allen's Bogart. It is a nice touch, but the picture does not handle fantasy sequences particularly convincingly: there is a moment where Rob mentally beats up Laura's unctuous hippyish new boyfriend Ian (Tim Robbins), and the effect is somehow not as funny as it ought to have been - a diversion from the more satisfactory comedy of real life.</p> <p>Where a film adaptation could ventilate the humid bachelor atmosphere of Hornby's novel is in giving opportunities for women. Iben Hjelje is a very likeable Laura, Nick's nice, accessible and down-to-to-earth girlfriend.

      "body": "<b>The Guardian Newspapers Ltd</b> <p>The information against the Guardian was unspecific. Without repeating all the matters set out in the information it was said that parts of the submission \"may\" contain extremely sensitive material. No damage assessment was referred to in the information. In the application concerning the Guardian, I have considerable doubts whether there is any sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that a serious arrestable offence had been committed.</p> <p>Judge Stephens decided that condition (a)(ii) was fulfilled, notwithstanding the unchallenged evidence of Mr Elliott that it was \"extremely unlikely that a copy of the E-mail is still on the backup tapes\". From the judge\u00d5s comments that \"such material may be recoverable by persons of appropriate expertise\", he proceeded to the conclusion that there \"is\" special procedure material at the Guardian\u00d5s premises. I respectfully disagree on the evidence, at most, there was the possibility that such material might be available. Ms Montgomery persuasively sought to explain how material in electronic form could be recovered. But the evidence of DS Flynn was less convincing than Ms Montgomery\u00d5s submission, not because he was dissembling or untruthful, but No doubt because he had very little personal knowledge of the process and the likelihood of success.</p> <p>I further doubt whether the evidence being sought, that is, Shayler's email address, would have provided relevant and admissible evidence against him. Although he wrote a letter to a newspaper when interest in his activities, and his allegations, was heightened, and did so without claiming confidentiality, it has not been demonstrated that anything in that letter as printed would do more than help the general police enquiry. That would not make it relevant and admissible as evidence at Shayler's trial and there was no evidence to explain why his email address would, or should, of itself be so treated. Given the scarcity of information about Shayler's alleged offences it is also difficult to examine whether the material sought by DS Flynn was likely to be of \"substantial\" value to the investigation of Shayler's alleged offences. In all the circumstances I am not impressed with the proposition that ability of the Crown unequivocally to prove that Shayler actually wrote the letter published under his name in the Guardian is of substantial importance. And if it were, the point could be proved by calling a witness from the Guardian, to explain that the original was no longer available. </p> <p>I must deal with the suggestion, implicit in Mr Tugendhat's argument, that prior and extensive publicity of material falling within the Official Secrets Act should lead to the conclusion that it may be repeated with impunity. Constant repetition may be a relevant consideration in civil proceedings for an injunction, but every repetition may constitute another serious offence. Nevertheless, when the judge's final exercise of discretion comes to be made, he should balance precisely what national interest, or which individual's safety was being endangered, by repetition of material already in the public domain. In short, although Shayler would not avoid conviction for criminal disclosure merely because he had constantly repeated his disclosures, repetition might make it disproportionate for the special procedure to be deployed against a newspaper which printed a letter from him in response to its own earlier publication of an article critical of him, particularly when the letter contained nothing of any fresh significance.</p> <p>In my judgment the necessary access conditions were not established. No question of the exercise of the judge's discretion arose. The order should not have been made. The appeal should be allowed.</p> <p><b>The Observer and Mr Bright</b></p> <p>This case is more difficult.</p> <p>Judge Stephens proceeded on the basis that only the relevant available offence or offences were committed by Shayler: so he ignored DS Flynn's evidence in so far as it related to possible criminal proceedings against Mr Bright and the Observer. As far as he was concerned, the application related to Shayler's activities alone.</p> <p>Mr Bright's article purported to report details of his conversation with Shayler. There is a clear distinction between material which is likely to be of \"substantial value\" to the investigation (paragraph 2(a)(iii)) and material likely to provide \"benefit\" to the investigation (paragraph 2(c)(I)) and the presence on the Observer's premises of evidence likely to be relevant and admissible at Shayler's trial (paragraph 2(a)(iv)). What Shayler said to Mr Bright would be admissible against Shayler, but Mr Bright's notebooks and records of what Shayler said to him would prove nothing against Shayler. Although the information given to Mr Bright from Shayler might be extremely interesting, probably of value to the overall investigation, apart possibly from ss23 and 24 of the Criminal Justice Act any admissible evidence against Shayler arising from his discussions with Mr Bright is to be found either in Shayler's comments on his own website or in oral testimony from Mr Bright. In this context therefore he would be a potential witness against Shayler and apart from refreshing his memory from any contemporaneous notes, it is difficult to see how the records of his conversations would fall within paragraph 2(a) (iv).</p> <p>So what is left? Shayler\u00d5s website entry suggests that on 25th February he sent the Observer a copy of the submission he had made to the Government in the previous November. Mr Bright\u00d5s article purports to refer to the submission or letter, apparently sent to Mr Straw, the Home Secretary. From the details given in the article it is reasonable to infer that Mr Bright was either in possession of the letter, or at the very least of his own note taken directly from it when the article was written. Shayler was scathing of the article complaining, but only in a general sense, that journalists \"cannot even copy accurately out of the documents I give them\". Therefore notwithstanding those words, I am unable from the material as a whole to draw the further conclusion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that Shayler disclosed or sent any other document to Mr Bright or the Observer.</p> <p>The slow development of the Observer\u00d5s claim that \"relevant\" records would \"normally\" be destroyed, and the absence of any evidence from Mr Alton or Mr Bright to the effect that he had never been or was not still in possession of the November 1999 letter, or that he had indeed destroyed all his records, entitled the judge to approach the case on the basis that there were reasonable grounds for believing that Mr Bright or Mr Alton was still in possession of this letter.</p> <p>The proper analysis of the information about the letter has forced me to pause and reflect. There is no evidence from any police officer about the possible significance of the document, nor that the original was indeed sent to the Home Secretary by Shayler, nor any explanation of why Shayler\u00d5s original letter cannot be produced to the police. However the document must be put into context, and examined as part of the overall concern about Shayler\u00d5s criminality, and for the purposes of the access conditions not simply ringfenced and isolated from the rest of the case. Therefore, for different reasons to those which attracted Judge Stephens, I have concluded that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the access conditions in paragraph 2(a) are fulfilled in relation to this single document, but not in relation to any other material included in the application.</p> <p>As indicated earlier in this judgment Judge Stephens rejected the suggestion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that any offence had been committed under s5. I simply note that if Shayler\u00d5s website entry is accurate, Mr Bright incited him to commit an offence or offences under s1 of the 1989 Act. For present purposes I doubt whether the Crown would regard Shayler as a witness of truth. He is, in any event, unlikely to return willingly to the jurisdiction, to be called to give evidence against Mr Bright. The prospect of criminal proceedings against Mr Bright or the Observer arising from Shayler\u00d5s decision to disclose to the Observer a copy of the letter he had sent to the government in November 1999 is theoretical. In reality, in relation to this single document, the risk of self incrimination is non existent. Finally, there is no realistic possibility that a warrant issued under s9 in relation to this single document could possibly serve to stultify the proper functioning of the press. Shayler disclosed that he had sent the letter. It was a copy of a letter he had already sent to the Secretary of State. He invoked no journalistic confidence for it, and save on an imaginary basis none could be implied. I have considered the particular public interest conditions identified in paragraph 29(c). In my view the public interest is properly served by an order limited to this single document. In effect therefore, this appeal, too, is allowed.</p> <p>If I were wrong about the very limited ambit of the order which might follow in this case, I should add, by way of footnote, that, notwithstanding the considerations of paragraph (c), for the purpose of exercising discretion should have much more closely analysed the dangers of prosecution against Mr Bright for incitement, and assuming also that I am wrong about the proper construction about s9 in relation to self-incrimination, and second, and even more important in this particular case, I should have attached considerable importance to the potential danger that would have followed an order.</p> <p>In the wide terms sought in the original application, I believe that an order would have had a devastating and stifling effect on the proper investigation of the Shayler story. Virtually any journalist who made contact with him, and any newspaper publishing an article based on discussions with Shayler, would be at risk of a similar application to the present. To my mind that would be an unhealthy development, quite disproportionate to any practical advantages to the prosecution process.</p> <p>Finally, I should add that this judgment is concerned only with the deployment of warrants under s9 and schedule 1. Nothing said in it is intended or should be regarded as having any bearing on civil proceeding for an injunction.</p>",

In all the circumstances I am not impressed with the proposition that ability of the Crown unequivocally to prove that Shayler actually wrote the letter published under his name in the Guardian is of substantial importance. And if it were, the point could be proved by calling a witness from the Guardian, to explain that the original was no longer available. I must deal with the suggestion, implicit in Mr Tugendhat's argument, that prior and extensive publicity of material falling within the Official Secrets Act should lead to the conclusion that it may be repeated with impunity. Constant repetition may be a relevant consideration in civil proceedings for an injunction, but every repetition may constitute another serious offence. Nevertheless, when the judge's final exercise of discretion comes to be made, he should balance precisely what national interest, or which individual's safety was being endangered, by repetition of material already in the public domain. In short, although Shayler would not avoid conviction for criminal disclosure merely because he had constantly repeated his disclosures, repetition might make it disproportionate for the special procedure to be deployed against a newspaper which printed a letter from him in response to its own earlier publication of an article critical of him, particularly when the letter contained nothing of any fresh significance. In my judgment the necessary access conditions were not established. No question of the exercise of the judge's discretion arose. The order should not have been made. The appeal should be allowed. The Observer and Mr Bright This case is more difficult. Judge Stephens proceeded on the basis that only the relevant available offence or offences were committed by Shayler: so he ignored DS Flynn's evidence in so far as it related to possible criminal proceedings against Mr Bright and the Observer. As far as he was concerned, the application related to Shayler's activities alone. Mr Bright's article purported to report details of his conversation with Shayler. There is a clear distinction between material which is likely to be of \"substantial value\" to the investigation (paragraph 2(a)(iii)) and material likely to provide \"benefit\" to the investigation (paragraph 2(c)(I)) and the presence on the Observer's premises of evidence likely to be relevant and admissible at Shayler's trial (paragraph 2(a)(iv)). What Shayler said to Mr Bright would be admissible against Shayler, but Mr Bright's notebooks and records of what Shayler said to him would prove nothing against Shayler. Although the information given to Mr Bright from Shayler might be extremely interesting, probably of value to the overall investigation, apart possibly from ss23 and 24 of the Criminal Justice Act any admissible evidence against Shayler arising from his discussions with Mr Bright is to be found either in Shayler's comments on his own website or in oral testimony from Mr Bright. In this context therefore he would be a potential witness against Shayler and apart from refreshing his memory from any contemporaneous notes, it is difficult to see how the records of his conversations would fall within paragraph 2(a) (iv). So what is left? Shayler\u00d5s website entry suggests that on 25th February he sent the Observer a copy of the submission he had made to the Government in the previous November. Mr Bright\u00d5s article purports to refer to the submission or letter, apparently sent to Mr Straw, the Home Secretary. From the details given in the article it is reasonable to infer that Mr Bright was either in possession of the letter, or at the very least of his own note taken directly from it when the article was written. Shayler was scathing of the article complaining, but only in a general sense, that journalists \"cannot even copy accurately out of the documents I give them\". Therefore notwithstanding those words, I am unable from the material as a whole to draw the further conclusion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that Shayler disclosed or sent any other document to Mr Bright or the Observer. The slow development of the Observer\u00d5s claim that \"relevant\" records would \"normally\" be destroyed, and the absence of any evidence from Mr Alton or Mr Bright to the effect that he had never been or was not still in possession of the November 1999 letter, or that he had indeed destroyed all his records, entitled the judge to approach the case on the basis that there were reasonable grounds for believing that Mr Bright or Mr Alton was still in possession of this letter. The proper analysis of the information about the letter has forced me to pause and reflect. There is no evidence from any police officer about the possible significance of the document, nor that the original was indeed sent to the Home Secretary by Shayler, nor any explanation of why Shayler\u00d5s original letter cannot be produced to the police. However the document must be put into context, and examined as part of the overall concern about Shayler\u00d5s criminality, and for the purposes of the access conditions not simply ringfenced and isolated from the rest of the case. Therefore, for different reasons to those which attracted Judge Stephens, I have concluded that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the access conditions in paragraph 2(a) are fulfilled in relation to this single document, but not in relation to any other material included in the application. As indicated earlier in this judgment Judge Stephens rejected the suggestion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that any offence had been committed under s5. I simply note that if Shayler\u00d5s website entry is accurate, Mr Bright incited him to commit an offence or offences under s1 of the 1989 Act. For present purposes I doubt whether the Crown would regard Shayler as a witness of truth. He is, in any event, unlikely to return willingly to the jurisdiction, to be called to give evidence against Mr Bright. The prospect of criminal proceedings against Mr Bright or the Observer arising from Shayler\u00d5s decision to disclose to the Observer a copy of the letter he had sent to the government in November 1999 is theoretical. In reality, in relation to this single document, the risk of self incrimination is non existent. Finally, there is no realistic possibility that a warrant issued under s9 in relation to this single document could possibly serve to stultify the proper functioning of the press. Shayler disclosed that he had sent the letter. It was a copy of a letter he had already sent to the Secretary of State. He invoked no journalistic confidence for it, and save on an imaginary basis none could be implied. I have considered the particular public interest conditions identified in paragraph 29(c). In my view the public interest is properly served by an order limited to this single document. In effect therefore, this appeal, too, is allowed. If I were wrong about the very limited ambit of the order which might follow in this case, I should add, by way of footnote, that, notwithstanding the considerations of paragraph (c), for the purpose of exercising discretion should have much more closely analysed the dangers of prosecution against Mr Bright for incitement, and assuming also that I am wrong about the proper construction about s9 in relation to self-incrimination, and second, and even more important in this particular case, I should have attached considerable importance to the potential danger that would have followed an order. In the wide terms sought in the original application, I believe that an order would have had a devastating and stifling effect on the proper investigation of the Shayler story. Virtually any journalist who made contact with him, and any newspaper publishing an article based on discussions with Shayler, would be at risk of a similar application to the present. To my mind that would be an unhealthy development, quite disproportionate to any practical advantages to the prosecution process. Finally, I should add that this judgment is concerned only with the deployment of warrants under s9 and schedule 1. Nothing said in it is intended or should be regarded as having any bearing on civil proceeding for an injunction.",

      "bodyText": "At last, a dot.com in which you can place a little more faith than the all too ephemeral rest: www.lourdes-france.com, the website of the celebrated Roman Catholic shrine, has been attracting more than 10,000 cyber-pilgrims a day since its relaunch last month . \"It's a big, big success,\" Lourdes' IT manager, Philippe Leroux, said. \"People can now petition for a prayer by email, see the celebrated grotto of Notre Dame on the webcam and tune in to the daily rosaries on live audio. If they're lucky, a priest will have selected their petition from the daily download and include it in his service.\" More than 5m real pilgrims a year visit the small town in the foothills of the Pyrenees where, in 1858, the Virgin Mary apparently appeared 18 times in the Massabielle Grotto before Bernadette Soubirou. With 270 hotels and 13 campsites - more tourist beds than any French town except Paris - Lourdes caters to the faithful who flock there to sample its record of miracles. Thousands suffering from afflictions as diverse as blindness and tumours claim to have recovered after a visit, although the church has classified only 66 as miracles. To qualify, a cure must be declared \"certain, definite and medically inexplicable\" by a commission of 30 experts and submitted to the pilgrim's local bishop for ratification. The latest official miracle was announced last year, 12 years after a man was inexplicably cured of multiple sclerosis. Mr Leroux said the 670-page multilingual website was not intended as a commercial exercise to drum up more business for Lourdes, but for communicating directly with pilgrimage organisers, Catholic believers, the plain curious, and \"those who have no one else to turn to\". It was also aimed at thwarting rogue Lourdes sites. \"Virtual pilgrimage can never be a substitute for the real thing,\" he said. \"But it can be a help to the truly desperate. We get up to 60 requests for prayers a day, and I think people are comforted by being able to email the Virgin Mary.\"",

Bernard Murray was found not guilty of two sample charges of manslaughter resulting from the disaster in April 1989, when 96 people died during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The verdict on Mr Murray, 58, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, came after 21 hours and 26 minutes of deliberations by the jury of eight men and four women at Leeds Crown Court.

Who knows, it could be this season\" - Kevin Phillips with the words every Newcastle fan wants to hear.</p> <p><strong>REFUELLING UPDATE</strong></p> <p>With a popular music career that took in such greats as Fog on the Tyne and Geordie Boys, Paul Gascoigne is the type to keep up with the latest trends in popular music. So how gutted he must have been when top Liverpool \"superclub\" Cream announced that they would be barring Everton's new signing for fear he might get langered.</p> <p>\"Being life long Everton fans, we realise the temptations that Cream could be for Gazza,\" Cream said in a statement that was in no way intended to get the club some free publicity at the expense of a laugh at one of the greatest men this country has ever seen (sorry, please excuse the Fiver). \"With his recent off-field activities we thought it best if Gazza remained fit and at his best for the team. The only dancing we want to see from Paul is into the opposition's box!\"</p> <p>It may be funny for them, but the Fiver fears that Gazza could suffer if he isn't allowed to experience the latest in hot sounds, designer fruit juice and alcohol gob swill. So it's with great relief that we can bring you the news that the Caf\u00e9 Jazbar on Liverpool's trendy Albert Dock, who already \"have a lot of the footballers down here anyway\" pledge to maintain their open door policy \"as long as there is no discomfort or problems\".</p> <p>Can't think what that might mean. However, because the Jazbar are \"running a business\", they won't be giving out any free drinks. Unlike the G Bar, who will be glad to offer Gazza a free cocktail while he checks out the latest tunes. \"It would be better if he phoned up in advance,\" the Fiver was informed, \"but I don't think it would be a problem. My daughter loves him.\" Rave on!</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal are planning a \u00a37m bid for Belgium striker Emile Mpenza.</p> <p>Chelsea are interested in Internazionale defender Christian Panucci. The 27-year-old Italian would prefer to move to Roma, but Gianluca Vialli has not given up hope - he will offer either Didier Deschamps or Frank Leboeuf in a \u00a35m player-plus-cash deal.</p> <p>Bradford are ready to follow up the \u00a31.5m signing of Sunderland's Nicky Summerbee with a bid for Coventry striker John Aloisi.</p> <p>FC Zurich's South Africa international Shaun Bartlett is a \u00a32m target for Charlton.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Ex-superintendent Bernard Murray has been cleared of manslaughter in the case brought by the Hillsborough Families Support Group. The jury are still considering against former chief superintendent David Duckenfield.</p> <p>Gillingham chairman Paul Scally has been fined \u00a310,000 plus costs by the FA for breaching betting rules. Scally placed three separate bets on his side during the 1998-99 season, wagering that Gillingham would reach the play-off final and beat Manchester City 2-1 before the season had begun. He had also placed money on Gillingham securing promotion that year.</p> <p>Former Football Association of Ireland president Charlie Walsh has died at his home in Drogheda. He was president of the FAI from 1974-6.</p> <p>Ricardo Gardner and Jussi Jaaskelainen have signed extensions to their Bolton contracts, keeping them with Sam Allardyce's side until 2002 and 2004 respectively.</p> <p>Financier Keith Harris, 47, has been appointed the new independent chairman of the Football League, replacing Peter Middleton who retired from the post in June.

The Danes are managed by former Arsenal goalscoring machine John Jensen, who has adapted his public speaking from his playing style. \"They are a better side than us given their playing staff and European experience,\" he droned today. Good news for the Gers, then, but Shelbourne can forget it - they've got a tough draw against Hadjuk Split or Dunaferr SE and that's if they beat Big Cup stalwarts Rosenborg, so they're as good as out. Hey look... I've just got a hole in one. On a par five. Again. Pretty neat, huh? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"There's going to come a time when I don't have a great season. Who knows, it could be this season\" - Kevin Phillips with the words every Newcastle fan wants to hear. REFUELLING UPDATE With a popular music career that took in such greats as Fog on the Tyne and Geordie Boys, Paul Gascoigne is the type to keep up with the latest trends in popular music. So how gutted he must have been when top Liverpool \"superclub\" Cream announced that they would be barring Everton's new signing for fear he might get langered. \"Being life long Everton fans, we realise the temptations that Cream could be for Gazza,\" Cream said in a statement that was in no way intended to get the club some free publicity at the expense of a laugh at one of the greatest men this country has ever seen (sorry, please excuse the Fiver). \"With his recent off-field activities we thought it best if Gazza remained fit and at his best for the team. The only dancing we want to see from Paul is into the opposition's box!\" It may be funny for them, but the Fiver fears that Gazza could suffer if he isn't allowed to experience the latest in hot sounds, designer fruit juice and alcohol gob swill. So it's with great relief that we can bring you the news that the Caf\u00e9 Jazbar on Liverpool's trendy Albert Dock, who already \"have a lot of the footballers down here anyway\" pledge to maintain their open door policy \"as long as there is no discomfort or problems\". Can't think what that might mean. However, because the Jazbar are \"running a business\", they won't be giving out any free drinks. Unlike the G Bar, who will be glad to offer Gazza a free cocktail while he checks out the latest tunes. \"It would be better if he phoned up in advance,\" the Fiver was informed, \"but I don't think it would be a problem. My daughter loves him.\" Rave on! THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal are planning a \u00a37m bid for Belgium striker Emile Mpenza. Chelsea are interested in Internazionale defender Christian Panucci. The 27-year-old Italian would prefer to move to Roma, but Gianluca Vialli has not given up hope - he will offer either Didier Deschamps or Frank Leboeuf in a \u00a35m player-plus-cash deal. Bradford are ready to follow up the \u00a31.5m signing of Sunderland's Nicky Summerbee with a bid for Coventry striker John Aloisi. FC Zurich's South Africa international Shaun Bartlett is a \u00a32m target for Charlton. NEWS IN BRIEF Ex-superintendent Bernard Murray has been cleared of manslaughter in the case brought by the Hillsborough Families Support Group. The jury are still considering against former chief superintendent David Duckenfield. Gillingham chairman Paul Scally has been fined \u00a310,000 plus costs by the FA for breaching betting rules. Scally placed three separate bets on his side during the 1998-99 season, wagering that Gillingham would reach the play-off final and beat Manchester City 2-1 before the season had begun. He had also placed money on Gillingham securing promotion that year. Former Football Association of Ireland president Charlie Walsh has died at his home in Drogheda. He was president of the FAI from 1974-6. Ricardo Gardner and Jussi Jaaskelainen have signed extensions to their Bolton contracts, keeping them with Sam Allardyce's side until 2002 and 2004 respectively. Financier Keith Harris, 47, has been appointed the new independent chairman of the Football League, replacing Peter Middleton who retired from the post in June. Neither Orville nor Cuddles the Monkey were available for comment. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5.30pm) That's your lot.

      "bodyText": "Reiss has been giving style-conscious guys aspirational looks at affordable prices since the early 70s. Founded by Yorshireman David Reiss, the company emerged in the 80s and swiped the Menswear/FHM retailer of the year award in 1997. But prepare for kitten heels clicking across your territory, boys - Reiss Womenswear launches this autumn, and looks set to give high street OAPs such as Karen Millen and Oasis a fright. If you don't drool like a bloodhound when you see the chocolate brown leather trench coat, knee-length tan leather wrap skirt, blue side-tie blouson top or the lusher-than-Liz's-best-effort backless \"Hollywood\" dress, you must have had your style surgically extracted. Jumpers and skirts come in luxurious plaid mohair, while fluid jersey wrap dresses will flatter \"curvies\" and \"stickies\" alike. Accessories are just as desirable; mustard suede handbags, argyle-knit bags and cord trilbies. A new flagship store opens in London this September in Market Place, W1, in the area north of Oxford Street termed NoHo. Whereas before we'd bide our time doing \"nice bum counts\" while he sifted through rails of stylish clothing, now we too can grab an armful and head to the fitting rooms. On second thoughts ...",

If you're in need of a confidence boost, for example, \"Try a good, strong red. Red is the base colour. It's go-getting, sexy, powerful.\" And if you think a new blusher isn't going to change your life, think again: \"Even little, subtle things can help.

      "body": "<p>Luciana Morad was changing into a mango bikini backstage at Rio fashion week a few days ago when she explained why Brazil is currently the darling of the fashion world. \"Gisele was part of it, but it started before that,\" said Brazil's second most famous model of the first. \"Brazil is full of natural resources. It has racial types from everywhere. And we are the people of the 'jeitinho ' - the crafty little way of getting what we want.\" </p> <p>It is not just the attentions of priapic rock dinosaurs that are being held by Latin America's largest country. \"The whole world is in love with Brazil,\" declared Vogue recently, \"The sand may be golden but the mood is red hot.\" Brazil is enjoying its moment of fashion glory. It's not just Gisele and fellow full-bodied Amazons colonising the northern hemisphere's catwalks and magazine racks. It is the musicians and designers, and the fabrics and jewellery, and - of course - the romantic image of a vast, passionate, laid-back, multicultural and sexually charged nation finally achieving its potential. </p> <p>\"I think that after all the minimalism that there was in the 90s, people want colour. People want what Brazil has got,\" says the designer Fause Haten. \"It's a happiness. Everything that people understand about us is linked to happiness - football, carnival, samba, beaches. Our women exude healthiness. Brazil is starting to be a focus. It is starting to be a style. People come here and they find that there is already a fashion scene. It's young, the shows haven't yet been going a decade, but it's strong.\" </p> <p>The current Brazilian boom has been helped by the crash of their currency 18 months ago, when its value dropped by about half against the dollar. This made exports much cheaper. \"There is a real 'thing' for Brazil at the moment. Brazil is very creative, and this is a great opportunity for us,\" says model-turned-swimwear designer Patricia Viera. For the past six months Viera's bikinis have been on sale in Browns in London's South Molton Street, where they have been snapped up by some of the world's most glamorous women. At her showroom two blocks from the beach, Viera holds up a bikini consisting of three tiny pink tie-dye triangles. \"This was made for Elizabeth Hurley,\" she says. \"Elizabeth wears my clothes all the time.\" </p> <p>Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's two pivotal metropolises, are the opposite sides of the Brazil fashion scene. S\u00e3o Paulo is urban, more temperate, richer and more dynamic. Its fashion week, a fornight ago, attracted international coverage. Some of its designers already show in the established fashion circuit: Alexandre Herchcovitch in London and Fause Haten in New York. Both Herchcovitch and Haten produce edgier, more cutting-edge clothes than the kind of beach-bunny fashion usually associated with Brazil. </p> <p>Rio is more provincial, although attracting increasing amounts of attention: this week, for the first time, the fashion director of Barneys New York flew down to Rio to see the shows, sending a strong message that upmarket retailers are ready to take Brazil seriously. \"She was amazed. No one realises that there is a proper fashion industry in Brazil. There is such a lot of potential here,\" says fashion consultant Robert Forrest. </p> <p>Other Brazilian designers may be moving on, but at Rio fashion week, swimwear still dominates with designers intent on exploring all the different ways of wearing as little as possible. Lenny Niemeyer - whose show received a standing ovation - explored a common theme among Brazilian desgners: using unconventional primary materials discovered from around the country. One line of bikinis was made of hundreds of tiny tropical shells. One used alligator skin. Another was made from fibres taken from a palm tree in the Amazon. \"I use a lot of craftwork and prints. They all export fabulously,\" she said. </p> <p>Tatiana de Camargo Nigri, 25, makes bikinis using a new process of heat-pressing crocheted leather inspired by basketmaking and sells to New York and London stores. \"Brazil is going through a process of discovery. Our fashion is much more professional than it used to be. It is much more sophisticated. It really is a thing of the first world now.\" </p> <p>The best known natural resource in Brazil, however, is its models. Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Vogue's model of the year last year, has led the way. Rio's models are known for their bikini-friendly physiques, and a different, more sassy way of walking - some say learned from walking along the beach. Flavour of the day is 16-year-old Raica, who has already been signed up by Christian Dior. Like Gisele, she is accompanied everywhere by her pet dog, a Japanese miniature. \"I think Gisele opened the door for us,\" she said. \"But there are lots of us and we are all different.\" </p> <p>But they are not that different. The Brazil that you see at Rio's fashion week reflects the country only myopically. Brazil has the largest number of black people of any country outside Africa, and yet in the shows I saw there was only one mixed-race model among dozens of blondes and brunettes. </p> <p>Rio's newfound chic, however, has not superseded its tropical characteristics - such as a less than rigorous approach to punctuality and organisation. From the timing of the shows to export schedules, Brazilians obey their own rules. The very thing which makes Brazil attractive could also be its undoing.</p>",

It is hard to warm to the thought of playing cricket in England's cold and soggy fields come next April, May, June, July.... More seriously, the weather in several other Test-playing countries is such that outdoor cricket year-round is possible.

This week, we have seen two of our team-mates, Archie and Shazi, score career-bests.</p> <p>Thirdly, club-level colt cricket is less well-developed in Barbados than in England. But it is catching up very quickly with many great players putting something back into the game. We have already seen a number of excellent batsmen, with superb natural strokes. Matchwinning bowlers are rarer at our age and so not having seen one yet means little, although we are all surprised and relieved not to be facing a barrage of pace bowling. Also surprising is the number of young players producing high-quality spin bowling and there are some names already on my list to be avoided in the future! In a few years' time, we will see most club first XIs comprised of colts who have come through the system, like my club Brondesbury in London. If you think we've had trouble against the Windies in the past, just wait for the future.</p> <p>Fourthly, despite the pessimists who blame American television for the waning interest in cricket here, the fact is that the game is everywhere: played in parks and on beaches, discussed passionately, remembered in the names of roads, roundabouts and public buildings. People seem interested in our tour, and the island is crammed with English schoolboys meeting local clubs and schools. It's great that our societies are sufficiently affluent to permit young players to meet here, in a beautiful nation that loves its cricket.</p> <p>Fifthly, the hospitality is amazing. I have particularly enjoyed meeting the players on the other side. Our parents have chatted and taken tea (and sometimes Bajan tea, spelt \"Banks Beer\") with their parents and all the younger children on the tour have played with the young local children at all the matches. Match lunches are abundant with tasty fodder such as grilled flying fish and sweet local tomatoes and plums.</p> <p>On Sunday night, Barbados played Costa Rica in a football World Cup qualifier. Most of the group went to the match. Costa Rica scored first, Barbados levelled it and then scored the winner with a minute or so left.

      "bodyText": "The farmer who has lodged a \u00a310,000 compensation claim for damage caused to his cornfield in the search for murdered eight-year-old Sarah Payne today said his actions were \"entirely proper\". While a police source who has visited the Payne family said they had reacted with \"disbelief\" to the claim, farmer Paul Langmead said that the cost of the damage could not be ignored. The damage occurred in the cornfields adjacent to Kingston Lane near East Preston, West Sussex, where Sarah disappeared after playing there with her brothers Lee, 13, Luke 11, and six-year-old sister Charlotte. Police have estimated that damage across approximately three acres of the fields was caused by the extensive searches but they are still awaiting clarification. This afternoon a middle-aged woman who refused to give her name issued a written statement at the Littlehampton farm run by Mr Langmead in which he pledged to donate any money received to the Sarah Payne fund. \"I am very upset that someone with Sussex police has seen fit to publicise the fact that I notified the police of damage to crops on my farm in the course of the search for Sarah Payne,\" Mr Langmead said. \"I and my farm staff have been deeply distressed by the tragic disappearance and murder of Sarah. \"However we cannot afford to ignore the fact that, through no fault of the police, many thousands of pounds of damage has been done to our crops during the course of searches for Sarah. \"It was entirely proper that the police should have been notified properly that a quantified claim was submitted in due course so that they or their insurers can make their own assessment of the damage.\" Mr Langmead said he and his staff would continue to help police with their inquiries.

      "bodyText": "A victory for press freedom was claimed today by two national newspapers in a high court ruling over the Shayler affair. The court warned against the making of court disclosure orders against newspapers which might \"stifle\" investigative journalism unless there was \"compelling evidence\" the orders were in the public interest. The Guardian and Observer won ground-breaking decisions that they were not legally obliged to hand over documents and e-mails following allegations by the former MI5 officer that British security services were involved in a failed bomb plot to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Lord Justice Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Maurice Kay and Mr Justice Gibbs, ruled the wide terms of production orders made by an Old Bailey judge \"would have a devastating and stifling effect on the proper investigation of the Shayler story\". Quashing the orders, he added: \"Virtually any journalist who made contact with him, and any newspaper publishing an article based on discussions with Shayler, would have been at risk of a similar application to the present. \"To my mind that would be an unhealthy development, quite disproportionate to any practical advantages of the prosecution process.\" Mr Shayler, now in exile in France, is facing attempts in Britain to prosecute him under the Official Secrets Act. Judge Martin Stephens made orders at the Old Bailey in March at the request of the prosecuting authorities requiring Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger to produce \"all files, documents and other records\" relating to an unsolicited e-mail letter sent to it by Mr Shayler, part of which had been published on February 17. The letter was in response to a Guardian article suggesting there had been exaggeration by Mr Shayler which had given foreign secretary Robin Cook \"an easy way out\" when he denied British involvement in the alleged assassination attempt in which innocent bystanders died. In The Observer case, similar orders were made under the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act against editor Roger Alton and the newspaper's home affairs correspondent Martin Bright relating to material e-mailed by Mr Shayler and used in a front page article on February 27 headlined \"Two Spies Named in Libya Plot\". Both newspapers fought the orders, arguing they would \"strike at the roots\" of their independence in a way which was both unlawful and unfair. They also accused the Government of attempting to \"suppress or shoot the messenger\".",

      "body": "<p>Convicted heroin smuggler Sandra Gregory today walked to freedom after serving seven years of a 25-year sentence.</p> <p>Tearful Gregory, 35, strolled from the gates of Cookham Wood prison in Rochester, Kent, to be met by her mother, Doreen.</p> <p>Gregory was jailed after being caught with heroin inside a condom in her body at Bangkok airport in 1993. She was freed after the King of Thailand gave her a pardon.</p> <p>She said: \"It is absolutely marvellous. I only found out yesterday when my mother told me. I was not expecting it at all and am humbled by it. I have learned an awful lot in the past seven and a half years. It has given me empathy with other people.\"</p> <p>Gregory, looking healthy in a red jacket and blue jeans, added: \"I think more than anybody I would like to thank my parents for everything they have done.\"</p> <p>Gregory said she accepted responsibility for what she did. \"I was guilty of breaking the law in Thailand and I take full responsibility for what I have done. I still think Thailand is a marvellous country.\"</p> <p>She was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment in Bangkok but was repatriated to Britain in 1997 to serve her sentence as part of the UK-Thai prisoners transfer agreement after a visit by the Queen and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, to the state.</p> <p>Gregory said she was still in shock and she did not know what she would do with her life or what the first thing she would do when she returned to Scotland. \"I would like to do something with drug rehabilitation,\" she said. \"There is a big demand for it. Most girls in prison have a drug problem.\"</p> <p>She said she was looking forward to seeing her 89-year-old grandfather and to taking a long walk.</p> <p>Speaking from the family home near Pitcaple in a rural part of Aberdeenshire, her father, Stan Gregory, 66, said he was \"over the moon\" at the news of his daughter's release. He said that he and his wife Doreen had been informed unofficially yesterday by the Foreign Office.</p> <p>He said of Gregory's incarceration: \"The punishment was quite right - it was the length of the sentence that has always been the issue.\" Mr Gregory said he felt \"relief\" at his daughter's relase, and added: \"I don't feel like opening champagne, because it's not that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>James MacKay, who had campaigned for the release of Gregory, said there was relief in her parent's home town of Inverurie, near Aberdeen, at the move.</p> <p>\"This is wonderful news,\" said Mr MacKay, an elder of the Church of Scotland who had used this year's general assembly of the church to call for Gregory's release. \"It is ridiculous that she has been incarcerated for so long. It is terrible that the government has done so little to help. It will be wonderful for her to be back home with her parents.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Convicted heroin smuggler Sandra Gregory today walked to freedom after serving seven years of a 25-year sentence. Tearful Gregory, 35, strolled from the gates of Cookham Wood prison in Rochester, Kent, to be met by her mother, Doreen. Gregory was jailed after being caught with heroin inside a condom in her body at Bangkok airport in 1993. She was freed after the King of Thailand gave her a pardon. She said: \"It is absolutely marvellous. I only found out yesterday when my mother told me. I was not expecting it at all and am humbled by it. I have learned an awful lot in the past seven and a half years. It has given me empathy with other people.\" Gregory, looking healthy in a red jacket and blue jeans, added: \"I think more than anybody I would like to thank my parents for everything they have done.\" Gregory said she accepted responsibility for what she did. \"I was guilty of breaking the law in Thailand and I take full responsibility for what I have done. I still think Thailand is a marvellous country.\" She was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment in Bangkok but was repatriated to Britain in 1997 to serve her sentence as part of the UK-Thai prisoners transfer agreement after a visit by the Queen and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, to the state. Gregory said she was still in shock and she did not know what she would do with her life or what the first thing she would do when she returned to Scotland. \"I would like to do something with drug rehabilitation,\" she said. \"There is a big demand for it. Most girls in prison have a drug problem.\" She said she was looking forward to seeing her 89-year-old grandfather and to taking a long walk. Speaking from the family home near Pitcaple in a rural part of Aberdeenshire, her father, Stan Gregory, 66, said he was \"over the moon\" at the news of his daughter's release. He said that he and his wife Doreen had been informed unofficially yesterday by the Foreign Office. He said of Gregory's incarceration: \"The punishment was quite right - it was the length of the sentence that has always been the issue.\" Mr Gregory said he felt \"relief\" at his daughter's relase, and added: \"I don't feel like opening champagne, because it's not that sort of thing.\" James MacKay, who had campaigned for the release of Gregory, said there was relief in her parent's home town of Inverurie, near Aberdeen, at the move. \"This is wonderful news,\" said Mr MacKay, an elder of the Church of Scotland who had used this year's general assembly of the church to call for Gregory's release. \"It is ridiculous that she has been incarcerated for so long. It is terrible that the government has done so little to help. It will be wonderful for her to be back home with her parents.\"",

At the Cologne summit last year, the G8 promised to write off \u00a370bn of debt owed by the world's poorest countries, with 25 countries to begin the debt relief process by the end of 2000. But with five months go to, only nine have qualified and only \u00a37bn of the \u00a370bn has been delivered. And the \u00a37bn had already been agreed under existing debt-cutting agreements. When did the ball get rolling on debt relief? Non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam have been putting pressure on governments and international financial institutions for years. In the mid to late 90s, the World Bank, under president James Wolfensohn, accepted the idea of debt relief and started pushing the idea. The International Monetary Fund went along after some initial reluctance. Britain has been at the forefront of debt relief, with John Major's Tory government very active on the issue.

The IMF and the World Bank are demanding more reforms. For example, the IMF demanded that Honduras include plans to privatise its electricity sector.

Leeds will be at home in the first leg against Bayern Munich's local rivals who finished fourth in last season's Bundesliga. TSV's most famous name is the diminutive, and ageing, Thomas Haessler, whose form for Bayern's \"little neighbour\" last season won him a recall to the Germany squad ahead of their disastrous Euro 2000 campaign. TSV have added Norwegian midfielder Erik Mykland to their ranks during the course of the summer, and former QPR defender Ned Zelic also turns out for them in defence. Rangers have a slightly easier task, facing the winners Danish champions Herfolge BK if, as expected, they come through their second round clash with Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas. Herfolge romped to their first ever Danish title last season under coach John Jensen, the former Arsenal favourite. Rangers will be away for the first leg, which will be played on either August 8 or 9. Return legs will be played on August 22 or 23. Full draw (x denotes seeded team): Tirol Innsbruck (Austria) v x-Valencia (Spain) Zimbru Chisinau (Moldova) or Maribor Teatanic (Slovenia) v x-Sparta Prague (Czech Republic) x-Brondby (Denmark) or KR Reykjavik (Iceland) v Hamburg SV (Germany) x-Inter Milan (Italy) v Helsingborg (Sweden) or BATE Borisov (Belarus) Besiktas (Turkey) or Levski Sofia (Bulgaria) v x-Lokomotiv Moscow (Russia) Haka Valkeakoski (Finland) or Inter Bratislava (Slovakia) v x-Olympique Lyon (France) Anderlecht (Belgium) or Anorthosis Famagusta (Cyprus) v x-Porto (Portugal) Herfolge (Denmark) v x-Rangers (Scotland) or Zalgiris Kaunas (Lithuania) x-Dynamo Kiev (Ukraine) v Red Star Belgrade (Yugoslavia) or Torpedo Kutaisi (Georgia) Dinamo Bucharest (Romania) or Polonia Warsaw (Poland) v x-Panathinaikos (Greece) x-Leeds United (England) v TSV 1860 Munich (Germany) Sturm Graz (Austria) or Hapoel Tel Aviv (Israel) v x-Feyenoord (Netherlands) Hajduk Split (Croatia) or Dunaferr (Hungary) v x-Shelbourne (Ireland) or Rosenborg Trondheim (Norway) St Gallen (Switzerland) v x-Galatasaray (Turkey) x-AC Milan (Italy) v Dinamo Zagreb (Croatia) Shaktar Donetsk (Ukraine) or Levadia Maardu (Estonia) v x-Slavia Prague (Czech Republic) or Samkir (Azerbaijan)",

One of the 16 drive mechanisms which propels the giant wheel failed just before 9pm last night and several hundred passengers were turned away, said a British Airways spokeswoman. About 10,000 people had booked tickets for rides on the millennium attraction, on London's South Bank, today. The latest mishap follows problems with ventilation eight weeks ago, when customers had to be offered extra water and the number of people in each capsule was reduced to aid airflow. BA London Eye spokeswoman Kate Gay said: \"Regrettably we have decided to suspend operations today to allow further inspections. \"We appreciate how frustrating and disappointing this is and we will be offering to re-book or refund flights. \"A telephone help-line is being set up to give operational updates for people planning to visit the London Eye but we would ask those with pre-booked tickets for today not to go to the attraction.\" Ms Gay stressed that the recent problem with ventilation was due to a particularly hot spell of weather, and not any inadequacy in the air conditioning, which was up graded several months ago.",

      "body": "<p>There are moments when you cannot but feel sorry for vegetarians. It's goat's cheese, you see, although soi-disant wild mushrooms are as much to blame. Pick up almost any menu you care to mention, and you can bet your bottom dollar that the vegetarian option for the first courses will involve goat's cheese: frequently grilled, plonked on top of, well, take your pick - \"mixed salad leaves\", grilled vegetables, tomatoes, and, in the rare, a virtuoso burst of originality: pesto, harissa, or some other equally unsuitable condiment. </p> <p>Turn to the main courses and it's the same again. Not goat's cheese this time, but \"wild mushrooms\", a hideous, viscous mass, like compost in the early stages of decomposition, piled on to - what shall we have? - pasta, polenta, pastry. And that, all too frequently, is that for the vegetarian in our midst. </p> <p>The situation in those restaurants that are devoted to the cause is generally worse. Any pretence of culinary sophistication is rejected with a rigour reminiscent of early Christian saints. I have eaten in a great many, and, with the exception of those restaurants where the food is a natural expression of cultural vegetarianism, such as in Gujarati cooking, I have found only one that remotely approaches the standards of non-vegetarian restaurants: Dennis Cotter's exemplary Caf\u00e9 Paradiso in Cork. But Cork is a long way to go for lunch. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong. There is good vegetarian food to be had in restaurants, especially Indian, Italian, Lebanese and Turkish, though few of these are exclusively dedicated to vegetarians. The winner of the vegetarian section in the last Time Out awards was Tas, a Turkish restaurant in south-east London, which caters as admirably for the offal lover as for the vegetable aficionado. </p> <p>You can even find imaginative and satisfying vegetarian menus in fine dining establishments. Paul Gayler, who set the ball rolling some years ago with ground-breaking dishes at Inigo Jones, now struts his stuff at the Lanesborough Hotel in London. Raymond Blanc offers a spectacular display of kitchen firepower at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. Alexis Gautier produces an exquisite vegetarian menu at Roussillon. But this is food which needs the resources, time and skill of a professional kitchen to pull off. And that's the trouble with vegetables. They require an awful lot of trouble to make into something substantial and memorable. </p> <p>It is OK, up to a point, to hurl together a salad, to slice a tomato and splosh good olive oil over it, boil an artichoke and dab the leaves in vinaigrette, but if you want to progress beyond that level, say into the hedonistic world of chickpeas, rice or polenta, then you have to be prepared to work at it. And, of course, in this work-ridden, stress-raddled, time-starved world, we simply aren't. As one of my colleagues commented: \"I used to be a veggie, but I gave up in boredom and apathy.\" </p> <p>For me, not eating meat would be like a painter striking blue from his palette. However, I eat a great deal of meat-free food, and am the happier for it, but I know that, compared to simple protein, meat-free dishes take a disproportionate amount of time and ingenuity to cook. Grilling, frying, or steaming a piece of meat, fish or poultry is but a single action, requiring not a vast amount of skill. A splodge of mustard and a dab of cream or butter, and you're away. </p> <p>To invest a cabbage, potato, courgette or broad bean with a similar degree of interest requires making subsidiary sauces, creating combinations, bringing a whole battery of additional ingredients to bear. </p> <p>Vegetarians are not helped much by the publications set up to exploit the market. Take the cover of the recently published 21st Century Vegetarian; not that there's anything remotely 21st century about it. It has all the sophisticated production values of a 70s student magazine. </p> <p>Anyway, most of the front is taken up by a photo of a few crudely hewn hunks of courgette smeared with the contents of a tin of tomatoes, with a pile of couscous - the all-purpose bulk item of the moment - to one side. Quick, certainly. Cheap, naturally. Edible, hardly. </p> <p>With very few exceptions the books written by vegetarians for vegetarians suffer from a similar poverty of thought, originality and instinct for simple pleasure. There are only so many wonderful ways with pasta that anyone can stomach. Yet it need not be so. The Caf\u00e9 Paradiso Cookbook, by Denis Cotter, and any number by the great Colin Spencer, show how. </p> <p>The prepared meals stacked so temptingly and obligingly in supermarket freezer chests and chiller cabinets should provide relief from this dreariness, as they do for so many carnivores. Yet even here the curse of vegetarianism casts its long and dreary shadow. </p> <p>I have given many of the offerings a proper trial: some, such as the pasta dishes, can be passable, with some brands notably better than others. But pasta is not specifically aimed at vegetarians, merely suitable for them. Those products developed specifically for them are, in my experience, devoid of any interest as food. </p> <p>The underlying proselytising nature of vegetarianism is made clear by the tolerance of meat lookalikes, sausages, burgers, bacon and mince, made from various kinds of soya-based products, most of which are aimed at children. It seems contradictory to place your faith in the fake foods when the real things are so much more interesting, just because they resemble the familiar excrescences of the food industry. </p> <p>In the final analysis, vegetarians could, perhaps, call upon their noted qualities of tolerance and humour, and recognise that they have only the intractable nature of the vegetable world to blame for their plight. </p> <p><strong>Life in a culinary underclass</strong></p> <p>When I was a kid, for a treat my brother and I would be fixed our own special meal for dinner. If we were lucky it was fish fingers and beans, or bangers and mash. </p> <p>Twenty-five years later and whenever I have dinner with one particular friend, she makes me a special separate meal. If I was nostalgic for being six again, it would be great, but the reason now is that I don't eat meat. </p> <p>By now it should be easy to be a vegetarian in Britain. The polls show that at least 5% of the population are totally veggie. Another 3% eat meat less than once a week. </p> <p>The specialist veggie food market is worth \u00a3450m (double what it was in 1992), and that's not counting the normal food (ie stuff that isn't meat) that veggies buy anyway. </p> <p>You can't open an issue of Hello! without falling over veggie celebs; loads of people either do it, flirt with it or have tried it. So why are vegetarians still treated like second-class citizens with an attitude problem? </p> <p>I became a veggie about eight years ago because I didn't consume that much meat anyway, and BSE put me off eating burgers. Now I don't eat anything \"with a face or a fin\", to quote a friend. </p> <p>Anyway, after a while it became obvious that good veggie food is actually more interesting than meat and two veg. That's because it requires more imagination. Yet people I know and respect in every other part of their lives treat us as if we are part of some odd cult. </p> <p>Here's what it's like in Britain if you choose not to eat meat. Most restaurants now have one vegetarian option, which is either a wild mushroom tart or maybe some type of goat's cheese salad. </p> <p>Alternatively, it will be what another friend calls \"some cheesy pasta shit\". And heaven save us from the courgette-and-couscous option. If you are eating with another veggie and ask if maybe, perhaps, the chef could give you a choice, the answer is dumb incomprehension, as if to say: \"Look, you chose this weird lifestyle. If you don't like it, tough luck.\" </p> <p>The fact still is, if you want a guaranteed good eat out, it is either south Indian or Italian. And that's it. Anti-vegetarianism permeates every aspect of British life. B&amp;Bs often advertise vegetarian breakfasts, for example. But what this means is that they provide egg, bacon, sausages and black pudding without the bacon, sausages or black pudding. The other week we ate in a hotel restaurant for an aunt's birthday. There was a huge and enticing veggie menu. Unfortunately, the chef hadn't made any of the options and it was back to a tin of ratatouille over dry pasta. </p> <p>Flying is another favourite. You can book a vegetarian meal three months in advance, fax the airline, and confirm it in triplicate, but when you get to the airport you find no record of your booking and only one veggie meal on the plane. Flying to Canada last year, the budget airline we went with wanted to charge \u00a38 per head. For airline food. </p> <p>There are so many others. At every official dinner I've ever been to, the vegetarians have been served last and ended up getting an indeterminate stuffed vegetable while everyone else on the table is tucking into dessert. </p> <p>In pubs there is always the ploughman's, but if you don't fancy a dry hunk of bread with some crusty old cheese and a thimble of pickle, you're stuck. </p> <p>I'm tired of soggy egg and cress sandwiches and quiche at weddings - which are always eaten by the carnivores anyway. Tired of the fact that food critics never mention vegetarian food because they are all confirmed meat eaters, so there's no pressure on restaurants to change or be inventive. And tired of being treated as if I'm some sort of lower life form. </p> <p>The veggie pound is not going to disappear. Get used to it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Combining fashion and art used to suggest only one thing: Mona Lisa T-shirts, available from all good museum gift shops at \u00a310.99. Now, though, art and fashion are not just having a light flirtation, but are dating, moving in together and having a full-blown love affair, and this marriage has parented a whole host of fashionably arty and artistically fashionable events. </p> <p>In the United States, fashion has had an artistic credibility for longer, due in part to the appointment in 1972 of former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland as consultant to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. There, visitors have been able to enjoy exhibitions celebrating Yves Saint Laurent (1983), Haute Couture (1995) and Christian Dior (1996), among others. Next May, instead of celebrating JFK's political achievements, the Costume Institute is f ting his wife's sartorial ones, with \"Jacqueline Kennedy, the White House Years\", curated by US Vogue's European editor-at-large, Hamish Bowles. </p> <p>The Guggenheim has responded in kind, with a celebration of Giorgio Armani's 25 years in fashion opening this October, as well as a retrospective of the current designer du jour (again), Azzedine Alaia. And as befits a designer whose work emphasises artistry and construction, Yohji Yamamoto is planning to curate a fashion exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. </p> <p>Nor is this veneration of fashion designers happening only in famously fashion-conscious New York. Fashion fiends around the world can visit exhibitions on Viktor and Rolf (Utrecht), Gianfranco Ferre (Florence) and Alexander McQueen (Avignon) this year. Meanwhile, London has recently played host to an exhibition on Vivienne Westwood and for the past year the V&amp;A has been putting on monthly fashion shows by modern designers, such as Matthew Williamson and Stella McCartney. Fear not if you've missed these: next month Newcastle's Laing Art Gallery will be exhibiting dresses by Todd Oldfield, and in 2001 the Zandra Rhodes Museum of Fashion and Textiles opens, featuring the works of Rhodes and her contemporaries. </p> <p>This intermixing of art and fashion is not happening only in cold museum exhibition halls, but also on a more practical level, with fashion designers creating works of art and vice-versa. This month, fashionable French boutique Colette is putting on an exhibi tion with works by Jeremy Scott, Nicholas Ghesquiere and Veronique Branquinho.

Similarly, at the Shu Uemera store on Boulevard St-Germain in Paris there is currently an exhibition of works by the sculptor Gudy, whose husband, in a further crossover between art and fashion, was formerly the creative partner of fashion designer Daniel Hechter. \"Fashion is an applied art and you get so many cross-elements,\" says Ehrman. \"So it seems to me perfectly right to show art in fashion stores, and it will probably come to London soon.\" </p> <p>Occasionally, the art shows in stores become about fashion itself.

      "bodyText": "Combining fashion and art used to suggest only one thing: Mona Lisa T-shirts, available from all good museum gift shops at \u00a310.99. Now, though, art and fashion are not just having a light flirtation, but are dating, moving in together and having a full-blown love affair, and this marriage has parented a whole host of fashionably arty and artistically fashionable events. In the United States, fashion has had an artistic credibility for longer, due in part to the appointment in 1972 of former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland as consultant to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. There, visitors have been able to enjoy exhibitions celebrating Yves Saint Laurent (1983), Haute Couture (1995) and Christian Dior (1996), among others. Next May, instead of celebrating JFK's political achievements, the Costume Institute is f ting his wife's sartorial ones, with \"Jacqueline Kennedy, the White House Years\", curated by US Vogue's European editor-at-large, Hamish Bowles. The Guggenheim has responded in kind, with a celebration of Giorgio Armani's 25 years in fashion opening this October, as well as a retrospective of the current designer du jour (again), Azzedine Alaia. And as befits a designer whose work emphasises artistry and construction, Yohji Yamamoto is planning to curate a fashion exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Nor is this veneration of fashion designers happening only in famously fashion-conscious New York. Fashion fiends around the world can visit exhibitions on Viktor and Rolf (Utrecht), Gianfranco Ferre (Florence) and Alexander McQueen (Avignon) this year. Meanwhile, London has recently played host to an exhibition on Vivienne Westwood and for the past year the V&amp;A has been putting on monthly fashion shows by modern designers, such as Matthew Williamson and Stella McCartney. Fear not if you've missed these: next month Newcastle's Laing Art Gallery will be exhibiting dresses by Todd Oldfield, and in 2001 the Zandra Rhodes Museum of Fashion and Textiles opens, featuring the works of Rhodes and her contemporaries. This intermixing of art and fashion is not happening only in cold museum exhibition halls, but also on a more practical level, with fashion designers creating works of art and vice-versa. This month, fashionable French boutique Colette is putting on an exhibi tion with works by Jeremy Scott, Nicholas Ghesquiere and Veronique Branquinho. Conversely, artists such as trendy British sketcher Ben Saffer have been invited to customise pairs of Levi jeans. Now that fashion photography is accepted as an art form in its own right, fashion, too, seems to be gaining a (fashionably late) admittance into the artistic canon.

      "body": "<p>Richard Neale, a consultant gynaecologist given a job in Yorkshire 15 years ago after being struck off in Canada over the death of a patient, was yesterday found guilty of a catalogue of incompetence, bad practice and lies spanning his time in Britain. </p> <p>A disciplinary tribunal of the General Medical Council, the doctors' regulatory body, found he had operated without the full consent of patients, carried out unnecessary and substandard treatment and failed to monitor his patients properly. </p> <p>All but one of 34 allegations against Neale relating to bad practice between 1986 and 1996 and claiming qualifications he did not have in 1997 were found proved by the GMC's professional conduct committee yesterday at the end of nearly six weeks of hearings. </p> <p>Neale faces being struck off the medical register in the UK if the committee decides next week, after mitigation hearings, that his behaviour amounted to serious professional misconduct. </p> <p>The case is likely to have serious repercussions. The GMC has already come under fire following revelations that it was informed by the Canadian authorities that Mr Neale's licence had been revoked in 1985. The GMC now has no record of the two letters sent by the licensing authorities for Ontario, where a patient of Mr Neale's died in childbirth after he gave her an excessive dose of a drug to speed up labour, and by the Medical Council of Canada. It does not dispute that the letters were sent. </p> <p>No action was taken to stop Mr Neale practising in the UK, which would have meant bringing a full GMC disciplinary case against him. It is believed that the letters from Canada were destroyed after three years, which was then the GMC's usual practice with allegations against doctors that were not pursued. </p> <p> It is understood that the GMC no longer destroys such evidence. Since last Wednesday, it has had a statutory duty to inform an NHS employer - a health authority or hospital trust - when there were serious charges being investigated against one of its doctors. It also now has a discretionary power to pass on information, such as the revocation of a licence abroad, where it thinks it is necessary, although the GMC has no record of where doctors are working and therefore of who needs to know. </p> <p>But while the GMC has already found itself at the centre of the storm because it did nothing to stop Neale working in the UK, there are questions to be answered by the Friarage hospital in Northallerton, north Yorkshire, where the gynaecologist worked until 1995. </p> <p>Managers at the Friarage were told that Neale's licence had been revoked not long after he started work there in 1986. </p> <p>By 1993, there was unhappiness with his work, partly triggered by scandal - Neale was caught soliciting young men. Patients began to refuse to be treated by him. First a panel was convened which demoted him.

      "bodyText": "Richard Neale, a consultant gynaecologist given a job in Yorkshire 15 years ago after being struck off in Canada over the death of a patient, was yesterday found guilty of a catalogue of incompetence, bad practice and lies spanning his time in Britain. A disciplinary tribunal of the General Medical Council, the doctors' regulatory body, found he had operated without the full consent of patients, carried out unnecessary and substandard treatment and failed to monitor his patients properly. All but one of 34 allegations against Neale relating to bad practice between 1986 and 1996 and claiming qualifications he did not have in 1997 were found proved by the GMC's professional conduct committee yesterday at the end of nearly six weeks of hearings. Neale faces being struck off the medical register in the UK if the committee decides next week, after mitigation hearings, that his behaviour amounted to serious professional misconduct. The case is likely to have serious repercussions. The GMC has already come under fire following revelations that it was informed by the Canadian authorities that Mr Neale's licence had been revoked in 1985. The GMC now has no record of the two letters sent by the licensing authorities for Ontario, where a patient of Mr Neale's died in childbirth after he gave her an excessive dose of a drug to speed up labour, and by the Medical Council of Canada. It does not dispute that the letters were sent. No action was taken to stop Mr Neale practising in the UK, which would have meant bringing a full GMC disciplinary case against him. It is believed that the letters from Canada were destroyed after three years, which was then the GMC's usual practice with allegations against doctors that were not pursued. It is understood that the GMC no longer destroys such evidence. Since last Wednesday, it has had a statutory duty to inform an NHS employer - a health authority or hospital trust - when there were serious charges being investigated against one of its doctors. It also now has a discretionary power to pass on information, such as the revocation of a licence abroad, where it thinks it is necessary, although the GMC has no record of where doctors are working and therefore of who needs to know. But while the GMC has already found itself at the centre of the storm because it did nothing to stop Neale working in the UK, there are questions to be answered by the Friarage hospital in Northallerton, north Yorkshire, where the gynaecologist worked until 1995. Managers at the Friarage were told that Neale's licence had been revoked not long after he started work there in 1986. By 1993, there was unhappiness with his work, partly triggered by scandal - Neale was caught soliciting young men. Patients began to refuse to be treated by him. First a panel was convened which demoted him. Then two years later he was given a \u00a3100,000 pay off to leave and a clean reference which enabled him to work first in Leicester, where he lasted only a few months, and then in the Isle of Wight. Most of the charges against Neale relate to his period at the Friarage, but the first com plaint was made by a patient on the Isle of Wight in February 1998. There followed huge publicity - including a Panorama documentary - once his Canadian history was discovered. Complaints began to flood in to the GMC, which increased the length of time it took to bring Neale before the professional conduct committee - eventually there were 62, which were whittled down to 14 likely to be successfully prosecuted. He was suspended last September, once the complaints had been approved by a preliminary committee. The charges found proved related mostly to gynaecologi cal operations, such as hysterectomies, sterilisations and procedures to stop incontinence. Graham Maloney of the victims' support group said the verdicts were welcomed by Neale's former patients, but they were still bitter about the length of time it had taken for him to be dealt with. He said: \"This is the right decision, but it should have come 14 years ago - this could all have been prevented. I feel very bitter about the system. \"We feel that the GMC protects doctors and guards patients from the truth. The system is there to protect patients from doctors like this, and clearly it has not worked.\" Victim who led the campaign endured four years of pain At the heart of the campaign against Richard Neale has been Sheila Wright-Hogeland, who led a victim support group and was also one of the complainants whose case was heard by the GMC's professional conduct committee. Mrs Wright-Hogeland, referred to during the hearings as Mrs B, told of a searing pain \"like a lightning bolt\" which beset her for years caused by endometriosis, a very serious condition where tissue from the lining of the womb grows in abnormal places, such as on the ovaries or in the pelvis. She was first diagnosed and treated in Paris in 1990. Apparently recovered, she returned to London, but later that year she collapsed. She saw Mr Neale who told her she was suffering from ovulation pains. Over the next five years, she continued to suffer acute shooting pains in the pelvis and abdomen. By December 1994, she was also suffering bleeding and in January 1995, Mr Neale noticed her swollen abdomen. The following month she had a total hysterectomy for what Mr Neale told her was the worst case of endometriosis he had seen. The GMC dismissed the charge against Mr Neale that he did not monitor or treat Mrs Wright-Hogeland adequately, but upheld her complaint that he had treated her in an unprofessional manner. She told the GMC that Mr Neale had threatened her when she told him she was going to see another gynaecologist and wanted her medical notes. \"He raised his voice considerably. He said she would live to regret it if she brought a lawsuit or complaint against him,\" said Vivian Robinson, QC, prosecuting Mr Neale. On a second occasion, she said, \"Mr Neale refused to hand over copies of the notes, saying he would provide them in his own good time. Mr Neale followed her into the waiting room and proceeded to have a tantrum.\"",

Above all, he inspired future generations of diaspora Armenians. His message for young Armenian writers, was \"Move! Do not remain paralysed in one place, change your environment!\" His own journeying showed that he practised what he preached.</p> <p>Oshagan was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, to the literary critic, Hagop Oshagan, and his wife, Araxie Astardjian Oshagan. He grew up first in Egypt, and then in Cyprus; the family later settled in Jerusalem, whose Armenian Quarter remains a valued religious outpost of the global Armenian community.</p> <p>He gained a doctorate in comparative literature from the Paris Sorbonne in 1951. It was in Beirut, however, where he established his reputation as a firebrand. From 1952 he taught philosophy, psychology and literature at numerous institutions, including the American University of Beirut.</p> <p>As a poet, he alarmed literary circles by spurning the traditional metre of Armenian verse, and by using the vernacular instead of formal Armenian. Three of his eight volumes of poetry were published there: Baduhan (Window), 1956; Kaghak (City), 1963; and Karughi (Intersection), 1971. He also joined Dashnaktsutiun, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, and later published weekly columns for their American paper, Asbarez.</p> <p>In 1975, uprooted once again as civil war swept Lebanon. he spent the next quarter century in Philadelphia. From 1976 to 1982 he taught Armenian literature, history and culture at the University of Pennsylvania. The American cityscape became the focus of his work, as exemplified by his 1980 epic, Ahazank (Alert). By contrast, most Armenian writers remained wedded to the rural settings of an idyllic past.</p> <p>Yet Oshagan still felt compelled to move. He spent two years from 1992 lecturing at the University of Macquarie in Sydney, Australia; then held classes at the University of California at Berkeley, California; and taught in Canada, Europe and the Middle East.</p> <p>In his last years, he renewed his bond with \"eastern Armenians\". Braving the war of the 90s, he lectured at the state university of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia's beleagured enclave within the rival state of Azerbaijan. His last book, as yet unpublished, is The Spirit of Karabakh.</p> <p>True to form, Oshagan lambasted the shortcomings of the republic's new rulers. At the first major conference to reunite the two wings of the Armenian world, held last September in Yerevan, he criticised easterners for unwarranted disdain towards, and ignorance of, their diaspora cousins. \"The diaspora is [also] a front\", he said. \"We are all soldiers of the Armenian people.\"</p> <p>Oshagan analysed the impact of the region's bloody history on Armenian prose and poetry and argued that its people should not close themselves off from the outside world. Nor should they jettison their identity by totally assimilating into western society.</p> <p>One of his greatest feats was to introduce the richness of Armenian culture to the English-speaking world, as editor of the yearly periodical, Raft, first published in 1987.</p> <p>Oshagan reserved his fiercest attack for the church. In his 1988 short story Odzum (Consecration), published in a volume entitled Around the Trap, he describes how three masked revolutionaries enter a tired old Armenian church in downtown Philadelphia, shout, kiss, smoke, and ultimately strip the parish priest to his underpants. Not surprisingly, many Armenian clerics called Oshagan a blaspheming pornographer, even \"an Armenian Rushdie\". Yet Oshagan hints at the true message in Odzum. The priest continues administering the sacrament despite his literal defrocking. To Oshagan, his personal integrity represents true Armenian heroism - not the trappings of faith and custom, nor the self-pitying ranting of the hotheads.</p> <p>Clearly others saw the true worth of his writing. In 1994, diaspora Armenians celebrated a 50-year retrospective of his achievements; two years later he received the St Mesrob Mashtots Medal from the Catholics of the Armenian church; and in 1998 Armenia's president awarded him a prize for contribution to Armenian letters.</p> <p>Oshagan was a living paradox: a rebel, a champion of individual liberty, and a one-man repository of his nation's rich heritage.

Anti-euro diehards in the UK are to take out adverts in the Danish press urging that country to retain the kroner in a plebiscite on September 28. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, accused the Eurosceptics, backed by prominent Tories including Lady Thatcher, of meddling in Danish affairs. The latest opinion poll showed Denmark effectively split over the single currency. The European Commission fears a \"no\" vote could deal a potentially fatal blow to the fledgling currency, starting what one senior official described as a \"domino effect\" in other states. Mr Cook said last night: \"They must make their own decision in their own interests. Tory anti-Europeans should practise what they preach and stop interfering in Denmark's internal debate. \"Their intervention is nothing more than a cynical attempt to exploit the referendum to advance their agenda of withdrawal from the European Union.\" Anders Panum, secretary general of the pro-single currency Danish European movement, said: \"What would people in Britain say if the French and Germans were pouring money into a British referendum?

Among the fund-raising events was a \u00a335 a plate dinner last Monday organised by the Romford Conservative Association with Lord Tebbit as guest speaker. Far-right organisations, including the Bruges group and Anti-Common Market league, sponsor the appeal, which is chaired by the Tory MP John Townend with the former Labour cabinet minister Lord Shore a trustee. The campaign claimed that if Denmark voted \"yes\", Sweden would probably follow next year, increasing pressure on Britain - the only EU country outside the eurozone - to give up sterling. \"If, however, the Danes vote 'no', the pro-euro campaign in Britain will be over before it begins,\" said a campaign leaflet which went on: \"We are appealing directly to British men and women to defend the freedom of a friendly country.

      "body": "<p>The elderly gentleman in the black leather jerkin and baseball cap is more relaxed than any first-time novelist has a right to be. He leans back in his chair, affable as anything, releasing a throaty chuckle every now and then. The only sign of discomfort comes when he walks a little stiff-legged across the room to fetch a coffee and croissant. He offers no delineation of his literary vision; there is no agonising over the great issues tackled in the work; no discussion of the author's all-consuming need to write. </p> <p>In fact, this one does not need to write. After more than 70 movies, two Oscars (for The French Connection and Unforgiven) and more nominations than he can recall, Gene Hackman doesn't need to do anything. His latest movie, Under Suspicion, will be released in the UK in the autumn. But there it is: at the age of 70, Hackman, a voracious reader, has published his first book.

You have to write it from his viewpoint.\"</p> <p>But nobody ever called The Catcher in the Rye immature. \"Maybe the narration could have been possibly a bit more intellectual, I don't know.\" Hackman might not know, but Daniel Lenihan, his friend, New Mexico neighbour and co-author, believes he does. \"I don't think it's immature,\" he says. \"There was one reviewer saying that this would be really good for young adults.\" </p> <p>Apparently this was not the effect they were striving for. \"Yeah, it's like the kiss of death really,\" says Hackman. \"It doesn't hurt. Actually, in many ways it helps.

You know, here's another book from a movie actor, celebrity or whatever.\"</p> <p>This double act, one of the world's most recognisable faces and his collaborator, who makes his living under the waves as a marine archaeologist, cooked up the idea for a novel one day in a cafe in Santa Fe. \"We used to talk about books that we enjoyed,\" says Lenihan, head of the Submerged Cultural Resources Unit of the National Park Service, \"and Gene of course is evaluating scripts all the time; and then we came up with 'Heck, why don't we just come up with a book like we like to read?' \"</p> <p>They like to read Robert Louis Stevenson, Conrad and Melville.

It's just one of those things.\" Lenihan then rather contradicts this apparant ignorance of O'Brian's work: \"He's a fine writer. That's not our remit.\" </p> <p>Hackman, at any rate, can live with a little negativity. As a young actor at the Pasadena Playhouse, he was one of two people voted least likely to succeed. The other was Dustin Hoffman. And what happened to the other actors, the ones who delivered the indictment? \"Haven't heard from them,\" he laughs. \"I'll tell you a funny story.

      "bodyText": "The elderly gentleman in the black leather jerkin and baseball cap is more relaxed than any first-time novelist has a right to be. He leans back in his chair, affable as anything, releasing a throaty chuckle every now and then. The only sign of discomfort comes when he walks a little stiff-legged across the room to fetch a coffee and croissant. He offers no delineation of his literary vision; there is no agonising over the great issues tackled in the work; no discussion of the author's all-consuming need to write. In fact, this one does not need to write. After more than 70 movies, two Oscars (for The French Connection and Unforgiven) and more nominations than he can recall, Gene Hackman doesn't need to do anything. His latest movie, Under Suspicion, will be released in the UK in the autumn. But there it is: at the age of 70, Hackman, a voracious reader, has published his first book. And then, out of nowhere, he mentions the reviews. Hackman says he never reads what people say about his movies, and maybe he doesn't, but the book is evidently a different matter. \"We had a review of the book, I don't know where it was, it said something about the book being, ummm, like it was immature or whatever.

      "bodyText": "A decade of disruption on rail and road was forecast last night as the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, unveiled his \u00a3180bn plan to revitalise Britain's creaking and underfunded public transport system. The forecast was made by the shadow strategic rail authority, which has the job of re-claiming parts of the railway scrapped almost 30 years ago by Lord Beeching. \"Passengers will have to expect more pain than gain. Miracles cannot be achieved overnight,\" said the SSRA. Mr Prescott was careful not to overegg the fact that he has just won the largest amount of money ever put into public transport by government. He gave no promises of a \"rosy traffic free future\", but said that his plan addressed the issues in a \"realistic and business like way\". The main criticism of the plan was that it was a \"smoke and mirrors\" job, relying heavily on grand figures and targets, but short on detail, particularly on what the government will do in the next few years. It particularly upset Ken Livingstone, London's new mayor, who claimed that he had been \"stitched up\" by Mr Prescott. Mr Livingstone thought that he had been given \u00a33.2bn without any strings, but then he was informed about what he called the \"unpleasant sting in the tail\". Within the past 24 hours, he was told that \u00a3104m would be needed from his allowance to pay for the mounting costs of the Jubilee line extension to the London Underground, which are now expected to total almost \u00a34bn, more than double the original cost. The spiralling cost of the Jubilee line extension contains hidden dangers for the government. Plans for the next 10 years are predicated on capital projects which often turn out to be far more expensive than budgeted. Many of Mr Prescott's projects will be on road development, where budgeting is more accurate. But projects like the west coast main line and the Channel Tunnel rail link are expected to cost considerably more. Mr Prescott told the Commons that decades of under-investment and the lack of strategic planning had left Britain with a transport system in crisis. It had been dogged by stop-go funding and a short term approach, but the government had now decided on \"a step change\". Bernard Jenkin, the shadow transport minister, accused Mr Prescott of \"promises, promises and promises\". He said the only guarantee with the announcement was that people would still be \"ripped off at the pumps and congestion on the roads would get worse\". Mr Jenkin said that the \u00a3180bn was a \"fantasy land spending increase\". He suggested that at the next election the government would have nothing to show for its labours. The figures were designed to mislead, he said. \"How much is double counted or reannounced? How much is just pious hope, empty promises and post-dated cheques?\" Of the \u00a3180bn, some two-thirds will come from the public sector and the rest from private business organisations. It includes \u00a360bn for railways, \u00a359bn for roads and almost \u00a326bn for local transport schemes. It was described by Mr Prescott as delivering \"a radical improvement for passengers, motorists, business and for all of us citizens\". He conceded that the \u00a3180bn was not all new money. Projects like the Channel Tunnel rail link and some light rail and road schemes have already been budgeted for. The plan is short on information about what the government will do to speed up public transport over the next three years. But a senior aide to Mr Prescott said afterwards that the SSRA would be laying out its strategy for rail in the autumn, together with the cost of new capital projects. Within the next few months, local authorities will also be presenting their plans to reduce congestion, including workplace charging, although this will not cost the government much money. The plan was enthusiastically received across a wide section of the transport industry. Sir Christopher Foster, chairman of the RAC Foundation described it as a \"tonic for all travellers\" which would cut congestion and provide a \"massive boost for the environment\". John Dawson, policy director of the AA, said: \"It's the sort of balanced package they've been used to in Europe for decades.

One of the country's largest bus operators, FirstGroup, hailed the plan as \"the best news public transport has had for many years\". The CBI's director general, Digby Jones, hailed the plan as a \"monumental victory for the business community\". Coincidentally, the CBI had been pressing for exactly the same budget as Mr Prescott produced. He said businesses throughout the UK had been crying out for an efficient transport infrastructure.

The cost of widening per mile ranges from \u00a39m to \u00a321m.</p> <p>Some 80 improvements to tackle bottlenecks at key junctions have been identified. They will include flyovers to replace roundabouts and traffic light junctions, widening slip roads and filter lanes.</p> <p>The first tranche from among 70 local road by-passes are due to be announced by the end of the month, with an average cost of \u00a315m a scheme.</p> <p>Under the plan, 30 strategic by-passes will be built at an average cost of \u00a319m. The government may encounter opposition from environmenal groups on some of them, as they will pass through large tracts of country.</p> <p>Road study groups are to report on schemes which will start next year. They include Lamberhurst and Polegate by-passes in Kent and Sussex, Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire and Selby, North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Automatic hold-up warning systems will be installed on 30 % of motorways by 2004, reducing accidents at the backs of queues on the most congested lengths.</p> <p>A national traffic control centre to start delivering services in 2002, will be fully open in 2003 in a private public partnership.

      "bodyText": "Plans to add an extra lane to 360 miles of trunk roads and motorways are at the centre of the government's roads plan. Ministers say this will be enough to widen some of the most congested sections of the network. Among options being looked at are a widening of the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester, key sections of the M1, M25, M42, M62 between Manchester and Leeds, the M60, and the A1 west of Newcastle. The cost of widening per mile ranges from \u00a39m to \u00a321m. Some 80 improvements to tackle bottlenecks at key junctions have been identified. They will include flyovers to replace roundabouts and traffic light junctions, widening slip roads and filter lanes. The first tranche from among 70 local road by-passes are due to be announced by the end of the month, with an average cost of \u00a315m a scheme. Under the plan, 30 strategic by-passes will be built at an average cost of \u00a319m. The government may encounter opposition from environmenal groups on some of them, as they will pass through large tracts of country. Road study groups are to report on schemes which will start next year. They include Lamberhurst and Polegate by-passes in Kent and Sussex, Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire and Selby, North Yorkshire. Automatic hold-up warning systems will be installed on 30 % of motorways by 2004, reducing accidents at the backs of queues on the most congested lengths. A national traffic control centre to start delivering services in 2002, will be fully open in 2003 in a private public partnership. It will provide strategic traffic management on all motorways and most important A-roads as well as real time driver information. Two hundred more motorway monitoring cameras are to be installed by 2004 to give faster response to accidents. The idea is to provide improved flow control on motorway access roads to smooth flows on to the main carriageway. Mr Prescott dubbed the controversial M4 bus lane on the approach to London a success and suggested that more may be in the pipeline, as well as special lanes for lorries, particularly at peak periods.",

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative cabinet minister Sir George Young has emerged as the overwhelming choice among Tory MPs to become the next Speaker according to a private survey of backbenchers, his supporters claimed last night. But their chances of winning over a crucial block of Labour MPs to back his candidacy, when Betty Boothroyd's successor is elected in October, will meet with stiff resistance from Labour stalwarts who regard him an an Old Etonian toff, not a backbench champion. Though a clutch of MPs from all the main parties have signalled their willingness to stand, no one has yet emerged as a clear favourite. Even Tony Benn, now 76 and scheduled to retire at the election, confirms that some Tories have asked him to stay on and fight for parliament's rights from the Speaker's chair. Though \"honoured\" by the appeal, the MP for Chesterfield is unlikely to run. Equally romantic, though also unlikely, would be the choice of the Tories' most distinguished libertarian and champion of MPs rights, Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge-Brownhills since 1979. Some MPs mention his name - though without much hope that he would garner enough votes. Signs of disquiet surfaced yesterday when MPs on both sides appealed for clearer rules or a secret ballot to prevent colleagues being \"browbeaten\" into voting for a semi-official candidate. The Tories tried and failed to impose one in 1983 and 1992. Sir George's promoters claim to have canvassed 130 of the 164 Tory MPs and found around 100 of them pro-Young - a claim which raises eyebrows among party whips and supporters of declared Tory rivals like Sir Patrick Cormack, Michael Lord, John Butterfill and Nicholas Winterton, who declared yesterday. On paper, Sir Alan Haselhurst, one of Ms Boothroyd's Tory deputies, has strong claims. But he is not thought tough enough by some colleagues to stand up for their rights against Tony Blair's executive-minded ministers. That is why several Conservatives - including Nicholas Soames - are openly backing Gwyneth Dunwoody, the 69-year-old Labour MP for Crewe She is famously fierce and independent, but also 69, only a year younger than Ms Boothroyd. The Young canvass team admits she is no 2 choice for up to a quarter of Tory MPs. But another Boothroyd deputy, Labour's Michael Martin, who has the support of many fellow Scots and parliamentary modernisers, is tipped to become the dark horse by some old hands, though that title is also being awarded to another would-be moderniser, John McWilliam, the convivial Labour MP for Blaydon. Mr Martin, MP for Glasgow Springburn, is regarded as a tough but fair chairman, controlling the often unruly Commons when the discliplarian Ms Boothroyd is off duty. Being seen as a Blair candidate will be the kiss of death for all but the loyalest Blairites, some of whom are already telling friends that Sir George may be acceptable. Old Labour lags suspect that may be a tactical ruse to deliver the bulk of Labour support to Menzies \"Ming\" Campbell, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman. While the rules governing the election of the Speaker prevent MPs from personally asking for votes, behind-the-scenes campaigns and counter-campaigns are well under way three months before a decision must be made. Mr Campbell has already come up against a \"stop Menzies\" drive by Tory and Labour MPs to prevent the job falling to someone from a minority party and a Scottish constituency, whom they see as a rather grand lawyer in a striped shirt. Mr Campbell cannot even muster full support from his own party to become the first Liberal speaker since 1928, since the deputy leader Alan Beith is also vying for the job. While party leader Charles Kennedy has told both men that, as party leader, he plans to remain strictly impartial, Mr Beith is already understood to be capitalising on his networking talents, which extend to some Labour MPs from the North-east.",

In a landmark decision, two judges in London ruled that Alan Milburn, the health secretary, breached article 10 of the European convention on human rights, the right to freedom of expression, when he decided that the inquiry should be held in private. The ruling will have far-reaching implications for official inquiries into matters of public concern and could significantly limit the scope for ministers to hold inquiries behind closed doors. Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Jackson, said Mr Milburn's decision contravened article 10 because \"it constitutes unjustified governmental interference with the reception of information that others wish or may be willing to impart\". The high court challenge was brought by 113 relatives of 55 victims known or believed to have been murdered by Shipman, 54, of Mottram in Longdendale, Greater Manchester.

He looked straight ahead to avoid acknowledging the MDC crowd waving red cards, which symbolise the opposition's call for Mr Mugabe's team to be sent off from the political game.</p> <p>The crowd's chants, calling for change, reached the panelled parliamentary chamber. But Mr Mugabe gave no indication in his opening speech that for the first time since he came to power in 1980 there is a significant opposition party in parliament.</p> <p>MDC leaders have said one of their first parliamentary actions will be to call for Mr Mugabe's impeachment, on the grounds that he incited violence and other crimes during the election campaign.</p> <p>The MDC has the votes needed to force a debate on the motion, which means Mr Mugabe will face unprecedented criticism in parliament.</p> <p>In his opening speech, the president promised to accelerate the redistribution of land from white farmers to poor black Zimbabweans.</p> <p>The address, which was generally bland, was broadcast outside on loudspeakers and was greeted with laughter and heckling from the crowd.</p> <p>The police tried to prevent the display of support for the opposition.</p> <p>They pushed back the crowd and made MDC supporters sit down and keep quiet, while members of the much smaller band of Zanu-PF supporters and war veterans moved around freely.</p> <p>\"It is the same as during the election campaign,\" said one MDC supporter.</p> <p>\"The police have one rule for the opposition supporters and a different rule for those supporting Zanu-PF.\"</p> <p>Another MDC supporter, Patrick Ndlovu, said he had come to see the opening of parliament \"because I wanted to see the new MDC members of parliament. They can bring change to this country. I am delighted\".</p> <p>Some scuffles broke out between supporters of the two parties, but for the most part the rivalry remained good-natured and peaceful.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe was jeered as he left the building and his cabinet ministers frantically rolled up the windows of their Mercedes to avoid direct contact with opposition supporters.</p> <p>The newly elected Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of the war veterans, crossed the street to get close to his supporters and wave his fists in the air.</p> <p>The MDC MPs, who also went over to greet their supporters, wore black armbands in mourning for the 31 people killed by Mr Mugabe's supporters during the election campaign.</p> <p>\"We cannot forget those who died to help bring change to Zimbabwe,\" said one of them, Priscilla Misihairambwi.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe usually holds a reception for all MPs on the eve of the opening, but he cancelled the event at the last minute on Wednesday, on the grounds that the government must trim its spending. Another explanation is that he could not bring himself to entertain the new opposition.</p> <p>\"We were going to boycott it anyway,\" said Paul Themba Nyathi, another MDC MP.</p> <p>\"We didn't want to dine with murderers.\"</p> <p>As parliament opened, Mr Mugabe's supporters continued to invade white-owned farms and tell the farmers to leave immediately, under threat of death. More than 20 farms in the Glendale area north of Harare stopped work because of the threats of violence from the war veterans.</p> <p>Following the opening the crowd dispersed throughout Harare city centre. A group of Zanu-PF women, wearing dresses featuring portraits of Robert Mugabe, threatened a white woman journalist and chased her down the street.</p> <p>Nearby a band of MDC supporters clambered on to a pickup truck singing: \"If I die because of political violence, it will be because of Zanu. Don't cry for me because I will be bringing change.\"</p>",

But Mr Mugabe gave no indication in his opening speech that for the first time since he came to power in 1980 there is a significant opposition party in parliament. MDC leaders have said one of their first parliamentary actions will be to call for Mr Mugabe's impeachment, on the grounds that he incited violence and other crimes during the election campaign. The MDC has the votes needed to force a debate on the motion, which means Mr Mugabe will face unprecedented criticism in parliament. In his opening speech, the president promised to accelerate the redistribution of land from white farmers to poor black Zimbabweans. The address, which was generally bland, was broadcast outside on loudspeakers and was greeted with laughter and heckling from the crowd. The police tried to prevent the display of support for the opposition. They pushed back the crowd and made MDC supporters sit down and keep quiet, while members of the much smaller band of Zanu-PF supporters and war veterans moved around freely. \"It is the same as during the election campaign,\" said one MDC supporter. \"The police have one rule for the opposition supporters and a different rule for those supporting Zanu-PF.\" Another MDC supporter, Patrick Ndlovu, said he had come to see the opening of parliament \"because I wanted to see the new MDC members of parliament. They can bring change to this country. I am delighted\". Some scuffles broke out between supporters of the two parties, but for the most part the rivalry remained good-natured and peaceful. Mr Mugabe was jeered as he left the building and his cabinet ministers frantically rolled up the windows of their Mercedes to avoid direct contact with opposition supporters. The newly elected Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of the war veterans, crossed the street to get close to his supporters and wave his fists in the air. The MDC MPs, who also went over to greet their supporters, wore black armbands in mourning for the 31 people killed by Mr Mugabe's supporters during the election campaign. \"We cannot forget those who died to help bring change to Zimbabwe,\" said one of them, Priscilla Misihairambwi. Mr Mugabe usually holds a reception for all MPs on the eve of the opening, but he cancelled the event at the last minute on Wednesday, on the grounds that the government must trim its spending. Another explanation is that he could not bring himself to entertain the new opposition. \"We were going to boycott it anyway,\" said Paul Themba Nyathi, another MDC MP. \"We didn't want to dine with murderers.\" As parliament opened, Mr Mugabe's supporters continued to invade white-owned farms and tell the farmers to leave immediately, under threat of death. More than 20 farms in the Glendale area north of Harare stopped work because of the threats of violence from the war veterans. Following the opening the crowd dispersed throughout Harare city centre. A group of Zanu-PF women, wearing dresses featuring portraits of Robert Mugabe, threatened a white woman journalist and chased her down the street. Nearby a band of MDC supporters clambered on to a pickup truck singing: \"If I die because of political violence, it will be because of Zanu. Don't cry for me because I will be bringing change.\"",

      "bodyText": "The cruise missile attacks that badly damaged the Serbian television and socialist party headquarters in Belgrade during the Kosovo war were specifically intended to maximise their domestic and international propaganda value, according to senior US officials. The attacks, among the most controversial of Nato's bombing campaign, killed 16 civilians and injured 16 others. They are singled out by US officials in an article in the latest issue of Jane's Defence Weekly, which also reveals that the British submarine Splendid fired 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the war, 17 of which hit their targets. It was the first time British forces had used American-made cruise missiles in a military operation. US ships and submarines fired 218 cruise missiles at 66 targets, and 181 reached their \"intended aim-points\", naval officers told the magazine. Planners assessed which parts of the television and party building were most likely to contain the controls for fire alarms and sprinkler systems and the missiles were programmed to hit these spots - they were directed into the sixth floor and on to the roof - to increase the chance that any fire they caused would spread.\" The building burned for three days, according to a senior US naval officer, who highlighted the propaganda value of having a well-known and highly visible government building lighting up the Belgrade skyline. Human Rights Watch in New York sharply criticised the attack in April last year. It rejected claims by General Wesley Clark, then Nato's supreme commander, and British ministers that the building was a \"legitimate military target\". Amnesty International also condemned the attack as unlawful and said it constituted a war crime. Nato governments say the building was used to pass information to Serb military units in Kosovo and to promote Serb propaganda. Another precise target was one floor of a building in Pristina housing the Yugoslav interior ministry police. Meanwhile it emerged that the families of Serbs killed in the missile attack on the building are suing the television station's bosses and Nato for damages. \"We think they are both equally responsible and both sides are running away from their guilt,\" said Zanka Stojanovic, whose son Nebojsa was killed during the attack. The families say the state television company \"violated the law by not allowing employees to go into shelters during an air raid\".",

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems yesterday set its sights on capturing a large slice of the \u00a350bn global market in customer services over the next 10 years as an engine for future growth. The Ministry of Defence alone spends \u00a36bn a year servicing its equipment, including fighter aircraft, and BAE wants to more than double its current 2% share of that business over the next three years in a variant of the private finance initiative. John Weston, chief executive, said on the eve of next week's Farnborough Air Show that the group has signed an agreement with the ministry's defence logistics organisation to help it meet its 20% cost savings target. These can then be used to fill gaps in the ministry's equipment budget. BAE Systems already provides some 10% of servicing for Britain's fleet of fighters but admits that it now takes 264 days simply to repair the flap on a Tornado, and this can be sharply reduced. The group wants to extend its expertise into the navy and army, and provide services such as training as well as repairs and maintenance. Mr Weston said: \"We will then leverage the competencies we are pioneering in the UK in overseas markets.\" The group, formed from last year's merger with GEC's Marconi defence business, said that it was on course to meet more than the promised \u00a3275m annual savings within three years. Mr Weston said that senior directors could win enhanced incentive bonuses if they produced \u00a3400m savings. The group has shed some 1,000 managers and recently set out plans for a further 3,800 job losses among its workers. BAE Systems shares rose 9p, or 2.1%, to close yesterday's session at 438p.",

There were claims that the luxury goods groups Gucci and LVMH had been pushed out of the formal auction for the business in favour of their Swiss rival, Richemont, which has a portfolio of famous brands such as Cartier, Alfred Dunhill and a 60% stake in Van Cleef and Arpels. Vodafone is understood to have signed an exclusivity agreement with Richemont, which is also an indirect joint venture partner with Vodafone in the South African mobile phone market. This brought complaints that Gucci and LVMH were unable to table their best offers for the business - which includes Jaeger-LeCoultre and other luxury watch brands. Swiss sources claimed that Vodafone had stopped the auction at just over \u00a31bn (2.6bn Swiss francs) despite the fact that Les Manufactures Horolog\u00e8res might attract bids of \u00a31.3bn or more. \"It seems very odd that an exclusivity agreement has been put in place before the auction has run its course,\" one adviser close to the negotiations said. \"I thought the auction was to ensure shareholder value.\" A Vodafone spokesman refused to comment. At \u00a31bn, bids for the watch group value the business at a hefty 10 times annual sales. Before the auction commenced, it was presumed it would raise little more than \u00a3500m. The Richemont group is controlled by the South African Rupert family, who also control the Rembrandt Group. In turn, Rembrandt owns 13.5% of Vodacom, the South African mobile phone business which is 31.5% owned by Vodafone and 50% by the Pretoria government. Telecoms analysts have speculated that the government may be a willing seller of its stake, with Vodafone the natural buyer. Vodafone has a strategy of trying to take 100% control of associate companies. Morgan Stanley is understood to be advising Gucci, while Goldman Sachs is working for LVMH. Coincidentally, UBS - one of Vodafone's advisers - also acts as Richemont's investment banker. The row over sale of the watch business comes at an irritating time for Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent, who is expected to face a stormy annual meeting of shareholders on Thursday in the wake of the controversy over the \u00a310m bonus handed to him as a reward for winning control of Mannesmann in the world's biggest ever hostile takeover battle. The sale of the watch business follows a string of disposals of non-core Mannesmann assets, including the German company's tubes business and the \u00a327bn sale of Orange, its rival in the British mobile market, to France Telecom.",

Gingrich's consequent defeat and humiliating retirement gave even greater credibility to the senator's quiet diplomacy.</p> <p>Born in Iowa, he moved south with his parents as a teenager. He took a while to settle into politics, first gaining a degree in journalism at the University of Missouri and then opting briefly for a career in the army. In 1964, after two years' service in Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea, he returned to civilian life to take charge of the family insurance business.</p> <p>At 31, he successfully fought his first election, becoming one of the few Georgia Republicans to be returned to the state Senate. Almost immediately he demonstrated his interest in legislative results rather than doctrinal purity, regularly collaborating with Democratic colleagues on projects he thought worth it. He gradually rose to become minority leader in the state Senate. With only five Republicans against 51 Democrats, it was hardly an onerous job and he concentrated most of his energies on building up the local party.</p> <p>His eventual success was not quite the outcome President Johnson had envisaged when he forced the Civil Rights Act through Congress in 1964. That, however, turned out to be the engine of the southern Republicans' revival. In the 1964 presidential contest, Georgia gave its vote to Barry Goldwater. Next time it backed George Wallace and so confirmed the end of the state's century-old post-Reconstruction tradition. In 1996 Georgia not only voted against Clinton but sent eight Republican congressmen and a mere three Democrats to Washington, a tribute to Coverdell's unremitting organisational efforts.</p> <p>In 1988, as chairman of the Georgia Republicans, he played a substantial role in Vice-President Bush's presidential campaign in the South. When Bush took over the White House, he rewarded Coverdell with the directorship of the Peace Corps. Faced with the unexpected collapse of communism, Coverdell then spent the next two years establishing new Peace Corps centres across Eastern Europe.</p> <p>His own bid for election to the US Senate in 1992 was a rude re-introduction to domestic politics. After a very raw campaign, inflamed by furious arguments about the Gulf war, the Democrats initially won the seat with 49% of the vote. State law, however, requires the winner to have an absolute majority and the election had to be re-run. Though President Clinton and Vice-President Gore campaigned hard for the Democrats and more than $1m was spent by each side, Coverdell eventually scraped home with 51%.</p> <p>On Capitol Hill he initially concentrated on the protection of the peanut industry, on which Georgia relies so heavily. In time, however, his long-term interest in foreign policy came to the fore and he became chairman of the sub-committee dealing with Central America and the Caribbean. That brought him up against two of the country's most sensitive issues, illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He successfully piloted new laws to impose tougher penalties on smugglers and to deport immigrants convicted of crime. He also became the leading proponent of a $1,300m US aid package to help Colombia's fight against drug traffickers and their insurgent protectors.</p> <p>Once again, however, Coverdell's main work was done behind the scenes. By now ranked fourth in the Senate party leadership, he was a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. As secretary to the Republican conference, Coverdell had to stitch together the sometimes unlikely alliances required in a constitutional system designed around deadlock. Georgia's other (Democratic) senator observed after his colleague's death, \"He never showed a trace of personal ego or animosity. He loved politics and he loved to contribute\".</p> <p>This self-effacement could, however, occasionally prove expensive. When Coverdell faced re-election in 1998 he was little known across the state in spite of his six years in the Senate. Opposed by a free-spending multi-millionaire, Coverdell stood doggedly on his Congressional record. He won by 52%, to become the first incumbent to be re-elected to the seat for more than 20 years. But the victory had cost him $7m.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Nancy.</p> <p><b> Paul Coverdell, insurance executive and politician, born January 20 1939; died July 18 2000</b></p>",

Though President Clinton and Vice-President Gore campaigned hard for the Democrats and more than $1m was spent by each side, Coverdell eventually scraped home with 51%. On Capitol Hill he initially concentrated on the protection of the peanut industry, on which Georgia relies so heavily. In time, however, his long-term interest in foreign policy came to the fore and he became chairman of the sub-committee dealing with Central America and the Caribbean. That brought him up against two of the country's most sensitive issues, illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He successfully piloted new laws to impose tougher penalties on smugglers and to deport immigrants convicted of crime. He also became the leading proponent of a $1,300m US aid package to help Colombia's fight against drug traffickers and their insurgent protectors. Once again, however, Coverdell's main work was done behind the scenes. By now ranked fourth in the Senate party leadership, he was a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. As secretary to the Republican conference, Coverdell had to stitch together the sometimes unlikely alliances required in a constitutional system designed around deadlock. Georgia's other (Democratic) senator observed after his colleague's death, \"He never showed a trace of personal ego or animosity. He loved politics and he loved to contribute\". This self-effacement could, however, occasionally prove expensive. When Coverdell faced re-election in 1998 he was little known across the state in spite of his six years in the Senate. Opposed by a free-spending multi-millionaire, Coverdell stood doggedly on his Congressional record. He won by 52%, to become the first incumbent to be re-elected to the seat for more than 20 years. But the victory had cost him $7m. He is survived by his wife, Nancy. Paul Coverdell, insurance executive and politician, born January 20 1939; died July 18 2000",

      "bodyText": "Applications for postgraduate teacher training have increased by nearly 50% since the government promised \u00a36,000 grants for trainees, figures out yesterday show. But separate figures from the universities and colleges admissions service, published today, show a 4.6% decline in applications for four-year undergraduate BEd courses, with which teachers qualify. Applications for secondary school BEd courses fell by 12.8% to 8,967, suggesting the grants may not so much encourage new people to teach as change the way that those who were going to be teachers anyway are trained. Overall, applications for higher education courses are down 0.4% on last year. A Ucas spokesman said many students who would have taken a BEd course may instead complete a subject-based degree course and then take the postgraduate qualification, with the \u00a36,000 bursary. Since the bursary was announced in March 2,830 graduates have applied for teacher training, an increase of 48% on the same period last year, the teacher training agency said. Applications for postgraduate teaching courses had been falling since 1995, but have risen this year by 1%. Whereas 16,936 applications had been made by July 15 last year, 17,463 were made by the same date this year. The Department for Education and Employment said that until March 30 this year, before the new recruitment bursaries were announced, applications were 11% down. Estelle Morris, the schools minister, welcomed the rise as a vindication of the bursaries and the \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" for teachers in shortage subjects. The awards, available from last September in maths and science, are being extended this year to modern languages and technology. Across those four subjects, applications are up by more than 1,000, including 432 applications for modern languages and 288 for technology. There has been a fall in maths teacher applications this year, Ms Morris conceded, but she said they were still 30% up on 1998, before the golden hellos were introduced. There were still shortages in London. \"We still need more teachers, but our introduction of training salaries has stopped a long-term decline in applications,\" Ms Morris said. Teachers will receive the \u00a34,000 when they are qualified, after the post-graduate course and an induction year in schools. But NUT general secretary Doug McAvoy said: \"A quick fix always produces an instant response, but this is a limited response and doesn't deal with the shortfalls that have built up over the years. \"The government has chosen to conceal the fact that applications do not turn into trainees and may never turn into teachers.

The threshold standards will now be put before the school teachers review body for consultation. Ms Morris promised teachers would receive money backdated to September 1 this year, \"so long as there are no further problems\".",

      "bodyText": "More than a hundred years after leading his legendary regiment of \"Rough Riders\" into the decisive battle of the war he did more than almost anyone to start, President Theodore Roosevelt may at last receive the bravery award he craved. Pentagon chiefs have endorsed a congressional recommendation to President Bill Clinton that Roosevelt should be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honour, America's highest award for bravery, for his heroism under fire in Cuba during the Spanish-American war of 1898. The recommendation now only awaits Mr Clinton's signature to become the medal's most belated award in American military history. It will be yet another striking sign of the re-emergence of \"TR\" as among the US presidents most admired by today's politicians. His actions in the war made Roosevelt, who resigned as assistant navy secretary to fight in Cuba, into the most famous American of his time. They helped to propel him towards the White House, which he entered in 1901 after the assassination of President William McKinley as the youngest president in US history. But his failure to win the Medal of Honour rankled with him until his death in January 1919. \"I am entitled to the Medal of Honour and I want it,\" wrote Roosevelt, never a shrinking violet, shortly after he returned from the war a national hero. Twenty-two other American soldiers, including two of Roosevelt's Rough Riders, received the medal for their bravery in the attacks on Spanish forces on Kettle Hill and the San Juan Heights, the decisive action of the war. Yet, for reasons which have never been fully explained, Roosevelt never received the award he coveted for his action on what he called \"the great day of my life\". Speculation that he would receive the medal began almost as soon as the dust of battle had settled, but the army failed to endorse the idea. \"I don't ask this as a favour, I ask it as a right,\" Roosevelt wrote later to his friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. \"I feel rather ugly on this Medal of Honour business, and the president and war department may as well understand it.

Software services companies in the FTSE 100 paid top executives an average of just \u00a3423,000, while telecoms firms offered \u00a3431,000. </p> <p>David Atkins, a consultant at the Monks Partnership, said: \"Pay at these companies does seem to be towards the bottom end.\" One of the reasons was that many hi-tech firms are still run by entrepreneurial people rather than professional corporate managers. </p> <p>\"Typically, some of the executive directors may well have been the founding fathers of the organisations. They're probably wealthy from share ownership in their own right.\" </p> <p>The worst paid boss in the FTSE 100 was Fran Rooney, chief executive of high flying Irish internet security specialist Baltimore Technologies. Mr Rooney received \u00a3190,000, despite running a company with a market capitalisation of \u00a32.6bn. He recently claimed he was not motivated by money, saying he was \"driven by pride and the desire to do things well\". However, his stake in the business is worth more than \u00a380m. </p> <p>Internet service provider Freeserve was similarly parsimonious - its chief executive, John Pluthero, is on a salary of \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>The best paid bosses were in financial, leisure, mining and drugs companies. After adding in the profits from exercising share options, Granada's chairman, Gerry Robinson, banked the most money during the year, making a total of \u00a36.28m. </p> <p>A spokesman for the media group said: \"Gerry Robinson is the architect of Granada's success. His pay reflects this.\" </p> <p>The study also calls into question the performance criteria attached to bonus payments, by revealing that nearly all bosses get close to the maximum possible payout.</p>",

However, Britain's fast growing hi-tech companies are reluctant to offer bulging pay packets. Software services companies in the FTSE 100 paid top executives an average of just \u00a3423,000, while telecoms firms offered \u00a3431,000. David Atkins, a consultant at the Monks Partnership, said: \"Pay at these companies does seem to be towards the bottom end.\" One of the reasons was that many hi-tech firms are still run by entrepreneurial people rather than professional corporate managers. \"Typically, some of the executive directors may well have been the founding fathers of the organisations. They're probably wealthy from share ownership in their own right.\" The worst paid boss in the FTSE 100 was Fran Rooney, chief executive of high flying Irish internet security specialist Baltimore Technologies. Mr Rooney received \u00a3190,000, despite running a company with a market capitalisation of \u00a32.6bn. He recently claimed he was not motivated by money, saying he was \"driven by pride and the desire to do things well\". However, his stake in the business is worth more than \u00a380m. Internet service provider Freeserve was similarly parsimonious - its chief executive, John Pluthero, is on a salary of \u00a3200,000. The best paid bosses were in financial, leisure, mining and drugs companies. After adding in the profits from exercising share options, Granada's chairman, Gerry Robinson, banked the most money during the year, making a total of \u00a36.28m. A spokesman for the media group said: \"Gerry Robinson is the architect of Granada's success. His pay reflects this.\" The study also calls into question the performance criteria attached to bonus payments, by revealing that nearly all bosses get close to the maximum possible payout.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Never get in a pissing contest with a skunk was one of Eisenhower's few bons mots. Pick your own ground to fight on, never your enemy's. So the government should look across the floor of the House at the assorted skunks, reptiles and vipers on the benches opposite and mark out its own chosen battlefield, avoiding theirs. How odd they spend so much time doing precisely the opposite.</p> <p>Labour will always win on health and education. Labour will win on public transport. They will win on taking children out of poverty, reversing urban blight and decay, creating the better life. Most of all, they win for general competence. With a bit more imagination, in their next manifesto they could win with other feel-good issues - free bus fares for all under 21s, free sports and leisure facilities, universal community nurseries or a general right to work a four-day week. To use that infamous memo-speak, Labour's \"brand\" should be a spirit of optimism and progress - a sense that anything really is possible in this extraordinarily lucky golden age.</p> <p>Instead cowardly, fearful and backward-looking, they slope off into dark enemy territory for a war they will never win. Law and order is Conservative home ground, always was, always will be. Even if Labour brought back the cat, the rack, the treadmill and transportation, law and order would still be a Tory issue. The awful visage of Widdecombe and Howard would outflank them on the right every time.</p> <p>Jack Straw suspects William Hague will call for the rope in his election manifesto. He also points with pride to Labour's scores as the party with the best law and order policy - but that is a mirage, just a reflection of Labour's overall competence rating. No one who genuinely puts punishment at the top of their agenda will vote for Labour to be toughest. All that happens is that Labour is pulled further and further rightwards in an ideological tug of war, wasting its energy, squandering its own \"brand\".</p> <p>Worse, it has seriously bad consequences in the real world. This week 4,000 more police were promised by 2003. Ministers hardly bothered to disguise the entirely political motive for lifting the falling police numbers to the highest level ever. The swelling \"More bobbies on the beat\" cry had become politically irresistible. But each \"bobby\" costs \u00a346,000 to run and the home secretary himself admitted there is no correlation between more manpower and best results.</p> <p>As for \"on the beat\", the Police Foundation records that a plod patrolling all day, every day will catch a burglar once every 15 years. An audit commission survey found a large number of the police never spoke with a member of the public in the course of a day's duty. When there was a sudden and dramatic decline in police as they were pulled off the streets in great battalions for the miners strike, researchers afterwards found no change in crime rates.</p> <p>Measuring what the police do is fraught with perversity - from the perverse incentive for a policeman to do very little so he has least chance of getting into trouble to the perverse behaviour of a public more inclined to report crimes and swell the figures when there are more police around to report them to. Drug busts are the most statistically satisfying, which may explain the huge number of drug possession arrests: it is a crime found and detected in one swoop, a 100% clear-up rate every time. Meanwhile researchers looking at what the police do all day find under-trained frontline managers deploying their troops guided only by lofty exhortation from above and gut instinct or old habits from below.</p> <p>Jack Straw is afraid to take on the bombastic political fire-power of the Police Federation. Time and again home secretaries have been advised that creating a cheaper second tier of street patrollers, community constables with good radios, can do what caretakers on rough estates do to reassure the population at half the price. But as with doctors, nurses and every profession, the union fights any dilution of their status and all home secretaries shudder when the Police Federation bellows.</p> <p>Worse by far is the promise of 2,660 more prison cells to be built to add to the highest prison population ever, now at above 65,000. Is that as well as the 4,000 extra yobs the prime minister recently promised to double-up in cells built for one? Each prisoner costs an average \u00a325,500 a year. A phenomenal \u00a3667m extra has been ear-marked - almost as much as the dome bill. The more cells are built and the louder the government talks up prison, the more the judges hurry to fill them. Mandatory sentencing for burglars will lead to locking up thousands more. There is also more money for drug programmes, education and treatment in prison and in the community - but the Home Office can give no figures to compare money spent on punishment and money spent on treatment. It will again be grossly disproportionate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we wait to hear Jack Straw declaiming to the Sun the triumph of one programme about which there has been soundbite silence so far. At any one time, 2,000 prisoners, mostly on shorter sentences, have been let out on electronic tags for the last weeks of their sentence; 60% of short-term prisoners reoffend, a high proportion within their first weeks of release. So far only 5% of those on tags have broken their agreed curfews and only a remarkable 1.9% have committed offences while tagged. It is too early to say yet if that good effect lasts longer - but Nacro, which runs many resettlement programmes for offenders, suggests that about half the prison population could be out on tags at less than half the price of prison; all the money saved could go on better treatments. Tags calm down erratic lives, help people get some structure into their day, making it more likely they will attend probation, treatment and training schemes.</p> <p>Jack Straw complains no one ever reports his praise for community treatment or for the many schemes now working well in youth justice, treating young criminals at an earlier stage. It is not headline-grabbing stuff. But he and Tony Blair have shown little appetite for going out to change the voters' insatiable appetite for punishment. Sun readers have not been regaled with true facts about what really reduces crime and reoffending. Talking about crime off the record, both Straw and Blair speak with an odd mixture of hard-nosed political expediency and sententious home-spun moralising, peppered with genuine knowledge of the research on what works, all in the same breath.</p> <p>They can no longer distinguish between these three - toughness and causes swirling about with crowd-pleasing. There is still no sign that they feel any duty to lead public opinion, only to swim with the tide wherever it takes them.

      "bodyText": "Never get in a pissing contest with a skunk was one of Eisenhower's few bons mots. Pick your own ground to fight on, never your enemy's. So the government should look across the floor of the House at the assorted skunks, reptiles and vipers on the benches opposite and mark out its own chosen battlefield, avoiding theirs. How odd they spend so much time doing precisely the opposite. Labour will always win on health and education. Labour will win on public transport. They will win on taking children out of poverty, reversing urban blight and decay, creating the better life. Most of all, they win for general competence. With a bit more imagination, in their next manifesto they could win with other feel-good issues - free bus fares for all under 21s, free sports and leisure facilities, universal community nurseries or a general right to work a four-day week. To use that infamous memo-speak, Labour's \"brand\" should be a spirit of optimism and progress - a sense that anything really is possible in this extraordinarily lucky golden age. Instead cowardly, fearful and backward-looking, they slope off into dark enemy territory for a war they will never win. Law and order is Conservative home ground, always was, always will be. Even if Labour brought back the cat, the rack, the treadmill and transportation, law and order would still be a Tory issue. The awful visage of Widdecombe and Howard would outflank them on the right every time. Jack Straw suspects William Hague will call for the rope in his election manifesto. He also points with pride to Labour's scores as the party with the best law and order policy - but that is a mirage, just a reflection of Labour's overall competence rating. No one who genuinely puts punishment at the top of their agenda will vote for Labour to be toughest. All that happens is that Labour is pulled further and further rightwards in an ideological tug of war, wasting its energy, squandering its own \"brand\". Worse, it has seriously bad consequences in the real world. This week 4,000 more police were promised by 2003. Ministers hardly bothered to disguise the entirely political motive for lifting the falling police numbers to the highest level ever. The swelling \"More bobbies on the beat\" cry had become politically irresistible. But each \"bobby\" costs \u00a346,000 to run and the home secretary himself admitted there is no correlation between more manpower and best results. As for \"on the beat\", the Police Foundation records that a plod patrolling all day, every day will catch a burglar once every 15 years. An audit commission survey found a large number of the police never spoke with a member of the public in the course of a day's duty. When there was a sudden and dramatic decline in police as they were pulled off the streets in great battalions for the miners strike, researchers afterwards found no change in crime rates. Measuring what the police do is fraught with perversity - from the perverse incentive for a policeman to do very little so he has least chance of getting into trouble to the perverse behaviour of a public more inclined to report crimes and swell the figures when there are more police around to report them to. Drug busts are the most statistically satisfying, which may explain the huge number of drug possession arrests: it is a crime found and detected in one swoop, a 100% clear-up rate every time. Meanwhile researchers looking at what the police do all day find under-trained frontline managers deploying their troops guided only by lofty exhortation from above and gut instinct or old habits from below. Jack Straw is afraid to take on the bombastic political fire-power of the Police Federation. Time and again home secretaries have been advised that creating a cheaper second tier of street patrollers, community constables with good radios, can do what caretakers on rough estates do to reassure the population at half the price. But as with doctors, nurses and every profession, the union fights any dilution of their status and all home secretaries shudder when the Police Federation bellows. Worse by far is the promise of 2,660 more prison cells to be built to add to the highest prison population ever, now at above 65,000. Is that as well as the 4,000 extra yobs the prime minister recently promised to double-up in cells built for one? Each prisoner costs an average \u00a325,500 a year. A phenomenal \u00a3667m extra has been ear-marked - almost as much as the dome bill. The more cells are built and the louder the government talks up prison, the more the judges hurry to fill them. Mandatory sentencing for burglars will lead to locking up thousands more. There is also more money for drug programmes, education and treatment in prison and in the community - but the Home Office can give no figures to compare money spent on punishment and money spent on treatment. It will again be grossly disproportionate. Meanwhile, we wait to hear Jack Straw declaiming to the Sun the triumph of one programme about which there has been soundbite silence so far. At any one time, 2,000 prisoners, mostly on shorter sentences, have been let out on electronic tags for the last weeks of their sentence; 60% of short-term prisoners reoffend, a high proportion within their first weeks of release. So far only 5% of those on tags have broken their agreed curfews and only a remarkable 1.9% have committed offences while tagged. It is too early to say yet if that good effect lasts longer - but Nacro, which runs many resettlement programmes for offenders, suggests that about half the prison population could be out on tags at less than half the price of prison; all the money saved could go on better treatments. Tags calm down erratic lives, help people get some structure into their day, making it more likely they will attend probation, treatment and training schemes. Jack Straw complains no one ever reports his praise for community treatment or for the many schemes now working well in youth justice, treating young criminals at an earlier stage. It is not headline-grabbing stuff. But he and Tony Blair have shown little appetite for going out to change the voters' insatiable appetite for punishment. Sun readers have not been regaled with true facts about what really reduces crime and reoffending. Talking about crime off the record, both Straw and Blair speak with an odd mixture of hard-nosed political expediency and sententious home-spun moralising, peppered with genuine knowledge of the research on what works, all in the same breath. They can no longer distinguish between these three - toughness and causes swirling about with crowd-pleasing. There is still no sign that they feel any duty to lead public opinion, only to swim with the tide wherever it takes them. Bad news rarely makes unnerved politicians better, but might the depth of cynicism revealed in the leaked memos make this pair set out in the autumn on a new course on law and order? Or will it be kneejerk business as usual? pollytoynbee@theguardian.com",

Klaus Eierhoff, director of Bertelsmann multimedia, said: \"CDnow is a pioneer in its field and an excellent fit with our online and offline music assets.\" Earlier this year, Bertelsmann struck an agreement with America Online to expand its distribution of media content and e-commerce across AOL's network. CDnow's board has approved the deal and the Olim brothers have agreed to sell their 5.8m shares, representing almost 18% of the stock. Before the deal was announced the stock was at $2.875 from a year high of $22.675. The sale reflects the financial difficulty of CDnow as the offer contains just a small premium for shareholders. CDnow will continue to operate under its brand name and become a subsidiary of Bertelsmann's e-commerce division. Jason Olim, chief executive of CDnow, said: \"We believe our combination with Bertelsmann is the best outcome for our shareholders, employees and customers. \"CDnow will continue to provide music fans with a digital connection to the world of music through music products, information, entertainment and community.\"",

Decade after decade, the Middle East has relentlessly stolen a disproportionate amount of the world's attention, resources, diplomacy, and psychic energy. The combined population of the five countries whose territories constitute the central zone of Arab-Israeli conflict is, as it happens, somewhat less than that of Japan. It is amazing that a region which contains only a small fraction of the world's people (if, on the margins, a great deal of its oil), should continue to occupy such a central position in everybody's calculations.</p> <p>It is typical, for instance, that the Israelis think the last country which should be called upon to pay the costs of a settlement, should there be one, is Israel itself. No, that task belongs to the United States and the European countries, who, along with the Arab oil states, are also called upon to finance the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian state, when we have it. Every step toward agreement in the Middle East in recent years has been accompanied by the chink of coins. Nowhere else would there be such an assumption that regional peace is so desirable that it should be subsidised to this degree. The American Congress may now be questioning it, but if so it is almost for the first time. The readiness to pay for peace as well as war in the Middle East is an index of a broad engagement which cannot be explained simply by the presence of oil. Nor does a mere cumulation of the different ways in which the region is significant, religious, political, and strategic, quite explain the matter. The Middle East has had an almost theatrical importance in world affairs, seeming to dramatise, in an endless shifting of scenes, every issue of importance in the past half century, from underdevelopment to imperialism, from secularism to fundamentalism.</p> <p>There was a time when many in the west identified with what they saw as Israel's heroic progress. Amos Elon, in the introduction to a new collection of his shrewd and perceptive dispatches, speaks of the \"near mythic quality\" of the six day war both for Israelis and many outsiders. Israel embodied a degree of national solidarity, a capacity for boldness, and an efficiency, especially a military efficiency, that some in western countries found very attractive. As they fumbled their way to the end of empire, or found themselves stuck, like the US, in new conflicts that were not going their way, Israel's super-sharp military style seemed, if unfortunately not a model they could duplicate, then definitely something to be admired. This pro-Israeli tendency merged with an earlier, much broader and less militaristic tradition of support for Israel that attracted people on the left, such as James Cameron, as well as from the rest of the political spectrum.</p> <p>The opposite tendency, which identified with the Arabs and with the Palestinians as they more and more strongly emerged as a visible nation, was always uppermost in the non-western world. There, in the eastern bloc, and on the left in the west it was projected as part of a global struggle for \"liberation\", a concept harder to define in retrospect than it was to applaud at the time. But the emotionally satisfying links this idea could forge between politics in different regions are described by Graham Usher, whose hard but fair reports from Palestine and Israel have recently been published in book form. Teaching in the East End in the early 80s to classes full of black and brown Britons and of recent refugees, he found that \"Palestine was the emblem of their own dispossession... the PLO's quest for a homeland chimed with their own aspirations of liberation, independence, and return.\" It was \"the prism that threw into relief the context, bitterness and violence of all the other causes espoused by my Kurdish, Iranian, Sri Lankan, and Chilean students.\"</p> <p>The point of change in western opinion probably came at about that time, with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. From then on, support for Israel was increasingly accompanied by criticism, including criticism from within the diaspora. Anxieties about \"terrorism\", similarly, were increasingly qualified by an understanding that it was another way of making war which was not necessarily more vicious than more conventional methods, even if it should not escape condemnation for that reason alone. Twenty years later, with the Israelis and Palestinians both worn down by events, it can be said that the heroic age in the Middle East is definitely over.</p> <p>Yet the end of idealisation does not mean, unfortunately, that common sense prevails. This is not only because new kinds of religious extremism have appeared on both sides but because the attempt to reach a final settlement throws both Israelis and Palestinians back on their history, a history which appears to both peoples to make certain demands.</p> <p>The attempt at finality also casts a long shadow over future politics on both sides. The PLO was founded to represent the Palestinians expelled from Israel, although in time the needs of those who stayed put in Gaza and the West Bank have come to assume greater importance. But how, in final negotiations, could the foundation issues of the return of the refugees and the control of Jerusalem be compromised? To say that the Palestinians need some returns and some of Jerusalem does not answer: the question is how many and how much. The Israelis are fighting on the same historical ground. For them the psychological question is the difference between their weakness in 1947 and their strength in 1967, which accounts in part for their obduracy on exactly the same issues of Jerusalem and the right of return. The symbolic clash is more important than the substantive issues, critical though these are.</p> <p>Whether or not the effort succeeds at this point, will the Middle East continue to exercise its strange power over the world? The larger region, as Fred Halliday points out in the conclusion to an enlightening collection of his essays, has lost some of its positive attractions but retains many of its negative aspects. It is economically weak to a startling degree in spite of oil, authoritarian with only limited exceptions, culturally repressed, and marked by a militarised and likely soon to be nuclearised rivalry which is by no means confined to the Arab-Israeli divide. The solidarity its people now needs from outsiders, he suggests, is a solidarity of rights that targets both external manipulation and local oppression, whatever the agents.

The solidarity its people now needs from outsiders, he suggests, is a solidarity of rights that targets both external manipulation and local oppression, whatever the agents. There is, in other words, a liberation yet to come. \u0095 Dispatches from Palestine, by Graham Usher (Pluto); A Blood-Dimmed Tide, by Amos Elon (Allen Lane); Nation and Religion in the Middle East by Fred Halliday (Saqi Book).",

There is also real willingness to use the powers of the Strategic Rail Authority and the franchising process to improve services and control fares.

The reduced journey mainly benefits businessmen. These sorts of projects often turn into bottomless pits, gobbling up general transport budgets. Now Prescott is prioritising an urgent upgrade of the West Coast line. Typically, Virgin, the main beneficiary, has recently abandoned cheaper, flexible off-peak tickets.</p> <p>Big projects and modernisation are all very well, but the vast bulk of journeys are not commuter journeys from city to city, but shorter, more complex, journeys by ordinary people. They travel across a town's outskirts, to and from shops, to schools and hospitals. Good bus routes, good connections, convenience and cheap fares make all the difference here.</p> <p>Again the 10-year plan sounds good, allocating \u00a359bn to local authorities to create coherent, environmentally-friendly plans. But \u00a331bn of that is for local road maintenance and it also has to fund incredibly expensive new light railway schemes.</p> <p>Local small-scale initiatives are the 10-year plan's poor relations. This is such a missed opportunity. Getting it right with public transport is not just about congestion-busting, but wider environmental issues. Good public transport can reverse the dominance of the car, which has destroyed the possibility of children playing in the streets or of elderly people moving safely. That is why charities such as Help the Aged, the WI, Playlink and the RNIB were campaigning with environmentalists around the 10-year plan with the Safe Streets Coalition. They favoured investment in bus and cycle lanes, speed reduction, home zones, and safe routes to school. These even make sense economically. An estimated \u00a32.5bn would have provided safe routes to every school, far cheaper than road building, and with considerable savings in terms of children's long-term health and in accident reduction. Prescott acknowledges their value, but provides no dedicated funding.</p> <p>So who has the government been listening to on transport? The answer is a litmus test for the soul of New Labour and tragically appears to be the motoring organisations and Mondeo Man. They have pitched the whole discussion in terms of \"congestion-busting\" rather than using transport strategy to enhance the quality of life.

It will mean reawakening controversial schemes such as the Salisbury and Hereford bypasses and the south coast \"motorway by stealth\". This will not just damage numerous wildlife habitats, but involve environmental damage on a devastating scale.</p> <p>What on earth are they up to? All research concludes there can never be enough congestion-free roads for people to drive where and when they like. Expansion creates more traffic and simply shifts congestion points. This scale of environmental damage would be intolerable.</p> <p>Does Prescott think road protesters melted away with the Tories?

      "bodyText": "Researchers are to design a new generation of economy seats to accommodate the increasing girth of air travellers, it was announced yesterday. Dean Southall, chief consultant at ICE Ergonomics in Loughborough, Leicestershire, which is carrying out the research for Europe's joint aviation authority, said yesterday that statisticians were analysing new data on passengers' leg length, stature and hip width to ensure safety - and a modest degree of comfort - for economy passengers. A spokesman for the CAA said these and other seat design regulations were under review because more people were being crammed on an increasing number of long-haul flights than ever before. New seats would also have to take account of taller and heavier passengers, he said. Mr Southall said: \"There is evidence that in the final decades of the last century we were getting taller and also wider. \"But in Europe and America the increase in height, caused by a change in diet, has now slowed down.\" The affects of prolonged flights on health will also be considered following evidence last year of a link between long-haul flights and passengers developing blood clots.",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 When the Guardian reported two days ago that Caroline Thomson has been dramatically promoted from deputy MD of the World Service to BBC public policy chief (she will \"lead the fight against the abolition of the board of governors\"), there was no room to mention her spouse. Caroline is married to my old friend Roger Liddle, a major player in the policy arena himself, as he was heard bragging recently at a BBC dinner party, as head of Europe policy at Number 10. If Roger has half as much influence with Mr Tony as he suggests, I'm convinced that he and Caroline will take every precaution to ensure minimal crossover in their working lives. Of course they will. Anyway, well done Caroline on the promotion.

As well as various indigenous tongues, the inter-ethnic Swahili language was a vehicle for singer-composers from across East Africa, and Nairobi became a regional centre for record companies. One of the early stars was Fundi Konde, who has died aged 75. </p> <p>Konde was the first guitarist in East Africa to use an electric pick-up. He developed his guitar technique with a South African-made acoustic instrument and a tuition manual by Bert Weedon and pursued a successful career - as singer, musician and recording engineer - for more than 50 years. Many of his songs became standards and are still played by Swahili dance bands throughout East Africa. </p> <p>As a child growing up in Waa, near Mombasa, Konde enjoyed the traditional nomba dance rhythms. At Catholic school he learned to read music and took up flute and clarinet to play hymns, European waltzes and foxtrots. After leaving school in 1940 he worked for the department of health, while developing his guitar skills in an informal band, playing at weddings and parties. </p> <p>The most popular styles were blues, calypso and Cuban son (rumba), to which Konde introduced Swahili lyrics and local sengenya rhythms. The band graduated to playing dances where palm wine fuelled participants' enthusiasm and, when music conflicted with Konde's job, he was fired. </p> <p>In 1944 he joined the King's African Rifles entertainment unit. Posted to India to entertain African, Asian and European troops, they recorded 10 songs at Calcutta's Dum Dum studio. </p> <p> In 1946 Konde joined the film and music producer Peter Colmore's African Band, contributing several hits and also appearing in Colmore's film Nyimbo za Kisasa (Today's Songs). </p> <p>By the early 50s, Konde was one of the most popular artistes in the region and regularly played in Tanganyika, Uganda and the Belgian Congo. During Kenya's Mau Mau emergency, he moved to Kampala in Uganda, but in 1954 returned to Nairobi to work at the African Broadcasting Service. </p> <p>He moved on to HMV records as A&amp;R man and studio engineer, recording with hundreds of musicians and releasing 30 records of his own. Among these were the hits Jambo Sigara, Kipenzi Wanui-Ua, Mama Sowera and Olivia Leo, in which Konde's deep, relaxed voice combined with sweet harmonies, simple melodies and his understated guitar to create universally popular songs. </p> <p>At the Hi-Fidelity and Jambo record labels, he engineered and played on Fadhili William's massive hit version of Malaika, one of the standards of African music, internationally popularised by Miriam Makeba. </p> <p>In 1963 Konde retired, to work his farm outside Malindi, but six years later he returned to Hi-Fidelity. In those days, one person would often arrange a song, tune instruments, set up sound levels, run the tape and accompany the musicians while they played, and Konde had the experience to do that effortlessly. </p> <p>In 1991 he produced an album for the Nairobi pop band the Mushrooms, the success of which revived Konde's name. A year later he met Scottish music writer Ronnie Graham, then African director of Help Age International, who was setting up Shikamoo Jazz, a band of veteran musicians in Dar Es Salaam. Konde did not formally join Shikamoo but he frequently guested and shared his experience with them. Konde's records had long been unavailable and Graham made a compilation of Konde's hits which was released in 1994 for the RetroAfric label under the title Retrospective. </p> <p>In 1995 Konde linked up with Shikamoo Jazz and the Zanzibari taarab queen Bi Kidude for the East African Legends tour of Britain, which included a Womad festival appearance. On their return home Konde was engaged as a special guest of Shikamoo. As a Kenyan he was liable to pay for an expensive business visa to work in Tanzania, but Graham was able to arrange for a much less costly and no less appropriate missionary visa. The authorities knew who Konde was and it is significant that they accepted his music-charity work in that category. </p> <p>He is survived by two wives, Zena and Sophia, and daughter Nimuna. </p> <p> <strong> Fundi Konde, musician, born August 24, 1924; died June 29, 2000 </strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>\"All day the heat had been barely supportable...\" The first eight words of Evelyn Waugh's Los Angeles black comedy The Loved One seemed all too familiar today, so I put it straight back on the shelf. I'll re-read it when the winter sets in and I need some heat coming off the page.</p> <p>Right now that's just about the last thing I want. I need cold, give me tundra, give me blizzards. I need Fargo. I need Scott of the Antarctic. I need my pin-sharp Cinemascope copy of Ice Station Zebra.</p> <p>I can easily understand why Howard Hughes watched ISZ over and over in his antiseptic Las Vegas penthouse, wearing Kleenex-box slippers and clicking his banana-length Freddy Krueger fingernails on the sterilised arms of his sterilised chair. Because he was nuts? No, because he lived in the desert.</p> <p>And why do I dream of avalanches, hypothermia and the soothing sound of chattering teeth? Because all day the heat has been barely supportable...</p> <p> It's official. Summer's here and the time is right for slumping in our seats. All weekend the radio issued its barometer-busting temperature predictions and its dude-inflected surfcasts as citizens of California lay around in their undies, stunned, poleaxed, and rendered strangely listless and lizard-like by the warmth and humidity.</p> <p> This is the time of year when the ground dries up and drives all manner of insects and beasties into your house for food and water. A friend of mine woke up on his couch one morning to find that overnight an army of ants had laid siege to the breast pocket of the shirt he'd fallen asleep in. An unbroken line of them was marching back and forth down the side of the sofa, and stretched 20ft across the hardwood floor to a tiny crack in his window.</p> <p>Waking up, he found his chest was a seething blur, and on closer examination he found that the ants were feasting on a piece of chicken that had fallen out of a taco he'd eaten the night before.</p> <p> Last summer, I had all manner of thirsty critters coming in through the catflap to drink out of my cat's food and water bowls. First there was the possum, a foot-long rodent with a pink pointy head. It looked at me blankly as I vainly implored it to bugger off. He left in his own good time, and on a full stomach, if you please.</p> <p> Then there was the skunk, which would be one of my favourite cuddly animals were it not for the fabled stench. Roused from my bed in the wee small hours, and thinking that my cat was hissing at a burglar, I tiptoed naked into the kitchen brandishing a baseball bat, and flicked on the lights just as the skunk raised its tail.</p> <p>That spray can ruin your whole week even if you're fully dressed, so I flung myself sideways into the bathroom and slammed the door. I nearly broke my neck but I came up smelling of roses. I thought the cat was a goner, but the skunk was freaked by the slamming door and legged it into the night.</p> <p> Relief from the heat can be sought in people's pools or at the beach, although the Beach Boys' Endless Summer ideal of sand and surf-bunnies has clouded over somewhat in recent years. There are gang rumbles on the dunes these days, and occasional shootings on the Venice Broadwalk. The Hyperion sewage plant south of Santa Monica sometimes malfunctions and vomits meningitis-bearing sludge into the surf, causing swimming to be banned.</p> <p>The beach is now totally off limits after dark. When I first visited LA nearly 20 years ago, I slept on Zuma beach for 10 days without a problem. If I tried that now I'd be spotted by one of the police gunships that patrol the shore, and issue tickets for trespassing.</p> <p> Mainly the heat just makes you lazy and sleepy. The oddest things strike you as perfectly normal, like the fully-laden hearse I saw using a Burger King drive-thru this afternoon. Actually that makes perfect sense: Forest Lawn cemetery is only a few blocks away, ringed by retirement homes, casket-builders, geriatric hospitals, flower shops, temp agencies for terminal nursing staff, funeral parlours and headstone designers - Glendale is a veritable city of the dead or soon-to-be-dead.</p> <p>Then there was the 90-minute live-as-it-happened freeway pursuit that preoccupied me in the middle of the day. Whenever he came anywhere near my neighbourhood, I could hear the roar of eight police choppers and five news-copters that tracked his progress and transmitted it to my telly.</p> <p>I was too lazy and flattened by the heat to go and look out the window. I was too lazy to change channels until it was over. When I did I heard the worrying and painful-sounding headline: \"Gore Catches Bush in Polls!\"</p> <p> Gosh. I hope he's all better in time for the Democratic convention here next month, which I think falls in the same week as another summer highlight: my annual pilgrimage up to Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 Charles Manson-Sharon Tate murders. You should have been there last year for the 30-year anniversary. My, what a gathering of the freaks that was.</p> <p> And X-Men, another gathering of the freaks, albeit a rather poorly-reviewed one, was the big box-office winner this weekend, taking in an almost unprecedented $57m. I suspect that along with the millions who came primarily for the air-conditioning, every geek in America also turned out, either mindlessly cheering at the special effects or mindlessly tut-tutting as they found out that their favourite X-Man hadn't made the cut.</p> <p> My personal fave was Halle Berry as Storm. To hell with the other characters' special powers, like nuclear halitosis and Midwich Cuckoos-style beams of blinding light; Storm, like Sean Connery in that rotten Avengers remake, can change the weather. Perhaps she could come over to my house and make it rain in my back garden for an hour every afternoon until Labor Day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"All day the heat had been barely supportable...\" The first eight words of Evelyn Waugh's Los Angeles black comedy The Loved One seemed all too familiar today, so I put it straight back on the shelf. I'll re-read it when the winter sets in and I need some heat coming off the page. Right now that's just about the last thing I want. I need cold, give me tundra, give me blizzards. I need Fargo. I need Scott of the Antarctic. I need my pin-sharp Cinemascope copy of Ice Station Zebra. I can easily understand why Howard Hughes watched ISZ over and over in his antiseptic Las Vegas penthouse, wearing Kleenex-box slippers and clicking his banana-length Freddy Krueger fingernails on the sterilised arms of his sterilised chair. Because he was nuts? No, because he lived in the desert. And why do I dream of avalanches, hypothermia and the soothing sound of chattering teeth? Because all day the heat has been barely supportable... It's official. Summer's here and the time is right for slumping in our seats. All weekend the radio issued its barometer-busting temperature predictions and its dude-inflected surfcasts as citizens of California lay around in their undies, stunned, poleaxed, and rendered strangely listless and lizard-like by the warmth and humidity. This is the time of year when the ground dries up and drives all manner of insects and beasties into your house for food and water. A friend of mine woke up on his couch one morning to find that overnight an army of ants had laid siege to the breast pocket of the shirt he'd fallen asleep in. An unbroken line of them was marching back and forth down the side of the sofa, and stretched 20ft across the hardwood floor to a tiny crack in his window. Waking up, he found his chest was a seething blur, and on closer examination he found that the ants were feasting on a piece of chicken that had fallen out of a taco he'd eaten the night before. Last summer, I had all manner of thirsty critters coming in through the catflap to drink out of my cat's food and water bowls. First there was the possum, a foot-long rodent with a pink pointy head. It looked at me blankly as I vainly implored it to bugger off. He left in his own good time, and on a full stomach, if you please. Then there was the skunk, which would be one of my favourite cuddly animals were it not for the fabled stench. Roused from my bed in the wee small hours, and thinking that my cat was hissing at a burglar, I tiptoed naked into the kitchen brandishing a baseball bat, and flicked on the lights just as the skunk raised its tail. That spray can ruin your whole week even if you're fully dressed, so I flung myself sideways into the bathroom and slammed the door. I nearly broke my neck but I came up smelling of roses. I thought the cat was a goner, but the skunk was freaked by the slamming door and legged it into the night. Relief from the heat can be sought in people's pools or at the beach, although the Beach Boys' Endless Summer ideal of sand and surf-bunnies has clouded over somewhat in recent years. There are gang rumbles on the dunes these days, and occasional shootings on the Venice Broadwalk. The Hyperion sewage plant south of Santa Monica sometimes malfunctions and vomits meningitis-bearing sludge into the surf, causing swimming to be banned. The beach is now totally off limits after dark. When I first visited LA nearly 20 years ago, I slept on Zuma beach for 10 days without a problem. If I tried that now I'd be spotted by one of the police gunships that patrol the shore, and issue tickets for trespassing. Mainly the heat just makes you lazy and sleepy. The oddest things strike you as perfectly normal, like the fully-laden hearse I saw using a Burger King drive-thru this afternoon. Actually that makes perfect sense: Forest Lawn cemetery is only a few blocks away, ringed by retirement homes, casket-builders, geriatric hospitals, flower shops, temp agencies for terminal nursing staff, funeral parlours and headstone designers - Glendale is a veritable city of the dead or soon-to-be-dead. Then there was the 90-minute live-as-it-happened freeway pursuit that preoccupied me in the middle of the day. Whenever he came anywhere near my neighbourhood, I could hear the roar of eight police choppers and five news-copters that tracked his progress and transmitted it to my telly. I was too lazy and flattened by the heat to go and look out the window. I was too lazy to change channels until it was over. When I did I heard the worrying and painful-sounding headline: \"Gore Catches Bush in Polls!\" Gosh. I hope he's all better in time for the Democratic convention here next month, which I think falls in the same week as another summer highlight: my annual pilgrimage up to Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 Charles Manson-Sharon Tate murders. You should have been there last year for the 30-year anniversary. My, what a gathering of the freaks that was. And X-Men, another gathering of the freaks, albeit a rather poorly-reviewed one, was the big box-office winner this weekend, taking in an almost unprecedented $57m. I suspect that along with the millions who came primarily for the air-conditioning, every geek in America also turned out, either mindlessly cheering at the special effects or mindlessly tut-tutting as they found out that their favourite X-Man hadn't made the cut. My personal fave was Halle Berry as Storm. To hell with the other characters' special powers, like nuclear halitosis and Midwich Cuckoos-style beams of blinding light; Storm, like Sean Connery in that rotten Avengers remake, can change the weather. Perhaps she could come over to my house and make it rain in my back garden for an hour every afternoon until Labor Day.",

      "body": "<p>Just as the movies were beginning to talk, Addie Sheldon met the comedian Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle on the set of a film he was directing for Educational Pictures called Up a Tree in 1931, in which she was to star. She started work in the 1920s, known as Addie McPhail, in Gower Street, a line of low-budget studios dubbed Poverty Row.</p> <p>It was a momentous meeting: \"I had feelings for Roscoe,\" says Addie, who's just turned 95. \"We worked together for several months at the studio before we even had lunch together. Even then, it was at the studio commissary, so the rest of the cast and the director were there too, so you might say that love came slowly for me. For Roscoe it was completely different - he had seen two of my movies, Midnight Daddies [1929] and Three Sisters [1930], and had immediately fallen in love with me. I believe at the time he was dating the heiress Dorothy Wallace. It was a short-lived affair. He had been married twice before.\" </p> <p>Arbuckle had spent 10 years adrift since he became involved in the first scandal to shake Hollywood when a wild party in San Francisco ended in a starlet called Virginia Rappe meeting a gruesome death. There are many versions of what happened, but widespread rumours alleged that Arbuckle had forced himself on her and accidentally suffocated her while having sex. </p> <p>He denied the charges and claimed he had no part in the affair. But it was too late: his name was anathema to every women's group and church organisation in America. In her 1980 autobiography, Swanson on Swanson, Gloria Swanson wrote: \"The newspapers had proved in less than a week that the public got a much greater thrill out of watching stars fall than out of watching them shine. One day Fatty Arbuckle had been their most beloved comedian next to Chaplin; the next day they were screaming for his head.\" </p> <p>Although he was cleared by a jury, the public had decided Arbuckle was guilty. After the court case, he disappeared. \"Roscoe was in the wilderness for 10 years,\" Addie recalls. \"The stock market crash of October 1929 hit him hard. He sold his nightclub and attempted a comeback as a film director under the pseudonym of William Goodrich. That is when we met. He rarely spoke about the scandal to me. I know he didn't want me to feel any sympathy for him. I didn't. Roscoe neither needed it nor wanted it.\" </p> <p>In Kevin Brownlow's book The Parade's Gone By, actress Louise Brooks recalled meeting Arbuckle: \"I was working at Educational Pictures in May 1931. He made no attempt to direct the picture. He sat in his chair like a man dead. It was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture [Windy Riley Goes to Hollywood] and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer, a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut - really delightful.\" </p> <p>Addie saw Arbuckle as a jolly, big-hearted man. She had seen him in comedies with Mabel Normand when her mother took her to the movies as a young girl. \"I never gave the whole affair a thought,\" she said. \"He hated people calling him Fatty. That was a character. After the scandal broke, I don't think he minded what people called him as long as they called.\" </p> <p>Addie McPhail was born in White Plains, Kentucky, on July 15, 1905. Her father was in the insurance business. He moved his family around America almost every two years. \"We settled in many small towns. In 1911, daddy took us to Chicago, Illinois.\" </p> <p>Addie loved the movies. In November 1925, the family was uprooted again, this time to Hollywood. \"I had already decided that I wanted to be an actress, so I thought this move was fate.\" Addie began working less than two weeks after her arrival in Hollywood. \"I came to Hollywood by the Santa Fe train. It was a very clean town in 1925. </p> <p>\"I signed a contract for the Stern Brothers comedies. When I wasn't working for them, they allowed me to go off and work as an extra doing bits for other studios in order for me to become acquainted with the profession. I was a stranger in Hollywood so it was only my appearance that opened doors, although they never opened very wide. Maybe I was never the actress I wanted to be.\" Addie felt her career would consist largely of having custard pies thrown in her face: \"The rough and tumble of comedy was hard, it eventually cooled my ardour for acting.\" </p> <p>For Arbuckle, on the other hand, the tide began to turn in September 1931, when Motion Picture magazine ran an article under the heading: Doesn't Fatty Arbuckle Deserve a Break? Director James Cruze was quoted as saying he was willing to direct the comedian in a movie and not take a cent of salary. Other movie people rallied to his side, including Buster Keaton, Marion Davies and Laurel and Hardy. The public joined the stars in support. It seemed that a new generation was about to forgive the man. </p> <p>By this time, Addie was engaged to Arbuckle and was working with him on a vaudeville tour. \"Roscoe was warmly received, even in Montreal and Quebec, and met with only a little opposition. He wanted to prove to himself that he had been missed.\" </p> <p>In February, 1932, a call came through from Jack Warner offering him the chance to perform in front of the camera again under his real name. \"Roscoe felt he had been given his life back. It was the call he had been waiting 11 years for. The Hays office was still wary of public opinion, and wanted to wait and see if they would forgive him before allowing Warner Bros to thrust him back into the limelight.\" Two months later, in Erie, Pennsylvania, the couple woke up the justice of the peace and were married. </p> <p>The two celebrated their first wedding anniversary together in a New York restaurant. \"Roscoe told Rivkin [his agent] that it was the happiest day of his life. We left the restaurant some time after midnight, Roscoe had a headache. Back at the hotel, Roscoe was laughing about something that had been said earlier that evening. He was really belly laughing, even when he got into bed. I went to the bathroom, I was calling out to him, on the way out I was still talking. Still he did not answer me. He was very peaceful. Looked as if he had fallen asleep. Then I realised, he was dead!\" </p> <p>Roscoe Arbuckle died at 2.15am on June 29, 1933. He was 46. Hollywood mourned his death. The actor and humorist Will Rogers said at the time: \"Those who demanded their pound of flesh finally received their satisfaction. Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle accommodated them by dying from a broken heart.\" </p> <p>\"What really surprised people was the fact that Roscoe never held any malice,\" Addie recalls. \"All he wanted to do was to make people laugh. His sudden death left me feeling devastated for a long while.\" During the 30s, Addie attempted her own comeback, but it did not last. After only a handful of films, her last being Northwest Passage in 1940, with Spencer Tracy and Ruth Hussey, Addie retired. \"It was over for me. I don't believe I ever did anything spectacular enough in pictures or on stage to be remembered for it. I was like a small ship passing through a rough sea.\" </p> <p>Today, Addie lives not 20 miles from Hollywood in a modest apartment block. Until recently, she worked as a volunteer nurse at the Motion Picture and Television country house and hospital in Woodland Hills, California. \"I was extremely happy in my 17 years of volunteer service. Some of the patients I knew from my time in Hollywood, or they knew Roscoe. When I reminded Norma Shearer, Caryl Lincoln, Viola Dana, Stepin Fetchit and others who I was, they would always smile and say something good about Roscoe.\" </p> <p>While Arbuckle's fall is well-known, the happy ending to his life is not. \"I believe Roscoe died happy,\" Addie concludes. \"He was with a girl who loved him and Hollywood had forgiven him and welcomed him back.\"</p>",

The first half introduces a set of believable characters with messy lives and lets you gradually work out the connections and relationships between them.</p> <p>Sayles's strengths are all here: working individuals with real-life problems, talking like real people. Sayles's dialogue often reminds you how artificial and plot-driven most big-screen debate is. The focus eventually narrows down to three main characters - David Strathairn (a Sayles regular all the way back to his debut) as a defensive ex-fisherman gradually getting involved with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's brittle singer and her resentful daughter, Vanessa Martinez. Everything looks set for a gritty relationship drama but the arrival of Strathairn's half-brother (Casey Siemaszko) sets the film on a different course: tense and gripping to the end.</p> <p>Siemaszko is rather too obviously a man you wouldn't trust to tell you the time of day, but the three principals are excellent and Martinez, who had a small role in Sayles's hit Lone Star, increasingly steals the show as the fevered Noelle. Mastrantonio and Strathairn pull off a believably awkward relationship, and the former also sings her own songs creditably in a vaguely Emmylou Harris mode and has a very fine speech explaining why she is a singer.</p> <p>The plot works its way towards an unusual final scene Sayles describes as \"the only ending that was right for the film\". I know this because he has a typically lucid and unpretentious commentary on the whole movie on the DVD which would make an excellent \"how to do it\" guide for any budding film-maker. Limbo is set in Alaska which, filmed by Haskell Wexler, looks as rugged as Kris Kristofferson, another Lone Star star, who has a small but crucial role here.</p> <p><strong> Sleepy Hollow </strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br>Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 <br> ****</p> <p>Tim Burton is the director, a virtual guarantee of a great-looking film, and his Gothic imagination is let rip to good effect once more. His blood-soaked take on Washington Irving takes the story firmly into his own world complete with Christopher Lee and three Gs of grotesque gothery, (Gambon, Griffiths and Gough).</p> <p>This is Hammer crossed with Monty Python's Black Knight sketch. Johnny Depp is the constable out of his depth when he is sent to investigate mysterious goings-on, in a role not unlike his accountant in Dead Man. He is provided with weird and wonderful detecting equipment but is no match for the headless horseman, who prefers everyone to end at the neck. When the horseman does have a head it's Christopher Walken's and even scarier. The plot is convoluted, but with Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson on hand along with a Frankenstein-style windmill and lots of spectacular effects, it's fun to let it wash over you. Heads you win. The DVD includes interviews with Burton and cast members.</p> <p><strong> Angela's Ashes </strong><br> Rental <br>Universal Cert 15 <br> **</p> <p>The film starts with a quote: \"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" It goes on to prove the point with lashings of rain, poverty, desperation, fleas, cold, premature death, and more rain.</p> <p>Angela's Ashes has every hardship clich\u00e9 in the book and makes it hard to see why Frank McCourt's Pulitzer prize-winning novel was so successful. Alan Parker assembles a fine cast, with Robert Carlyle, Emily Watson and three talented Frankies at different ages, but the poverty is ladled on with what, ironically, looks like great expense; and it's hard not to compare this long, laboured wallow in gloom with the freshness and surprising insights Lynne Ramsay brought to the same set-up (feckless drunk father and suffering family) in Ratcatcher recently, for a fraction of the cost.</p>",

I know this because he has a typically lucid and unpretentious commentary on the whole movie on the DVD which would make an excellent \"how to do it\" guide for any budding film-maker. Limbo is set in Alaska which, filmed by Haskell Wexler, looks as rugged as Kris Kristofferson, another Lone Star star, who has a small but crucial role here. Sleepy Hollow Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 **** Tim Burton is the director, a virtual guarantee of a great-looking film, and his Gothic imagination is let rip to good effect once more. His blood-soaked take on Washington Irving takes the story firmly into his own world complete with Christopher Lee and three Gs of grotesque gothery, (Gambon, Griffiths and Gough). This is Hammer crossed with Monty Python's Black Knight sketch. Johnny Depp is the constable out of his depth when he is sent to investigate mysterious goings-on, in a role not unlike his accountant in Dead Man. He is provided with weird and wonderful detecting equipment but is no match for the headless horseman, who prefers everyone to end at the neck. When the horseman does have a head it's Christopher Walken's and even scarier. The plot is convoluted, but with Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson on hand along with a Frankenstein-style windmill and lots of spectacular effects, it's fun to let it wash over you. Heads you win. The DVD includes interviews with Burton and cast members. Angela's Ashes Rental Universal Cert 15 ** The film starts with a quote: \"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" It goes on to prove the point with lashings of rain, poverty, desperation, fleas, cold, premature death, and more rain. Angela's Ashes has every hardship clich\u00e9 in the book and makes it hard to see why Frank McCourt's Pulitzer prize-winning novel was so successful. Alan Parker assembles a fine cast, with Robert Carlyle, Emily Watson and three talented Frankies at different ages, but the poverty is ladled on with what, ironically, looks like great expense; and it's hard not to compare this long, laboured wallow in gloom with the freshness and surprising insights Lynne Ramsay brought to the same set-up (feckless drunk father and suffering family) in Ratcatcher recently, for a fraction of the cost.",

Many prices will be 30% to 40% cheaper than rivals'. Among the offers will be Ray-Ban sunglasses for \u00a329.99, widescreen televisions for \u00a3349 and five litres of paint for \u00a34.97.",

Bluewater, which has quotations from Shakespeare and Milton built into the aisles, was an obvious first choice, but the gallery director, Neil MacGregor, said they were ready to continue the experiment. \"We will go on if we are asked - we are poised to go from mall to mall.\" Quentin Blake, renowned for his collaboration with the late Roald Dahl, is currently the first children's laureate.
