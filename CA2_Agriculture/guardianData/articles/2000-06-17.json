It was put to the England coach that this was a sweet moment for his goalscorer, Alan Shearer, the man in whom he has never lost faith even though he has been so bitterly maligned by a few people lately. 'A few people? Alan Shearer has answered his critics again. Just give him two or three days before you knock him again.

'A few people had stories written concerning myself and I'm very pleased to have scored and very pleased to have beaten Germany. You can see by our reaction at the end that we have to come down in the dressing room and realise we have won a game. But now the hard work starts again.' </p> <p>But briefly, surely, it is simply a time to relish. 'People say it's not the best German side but they gave us a really tough game, which is what I expected. What made the difference was spirit and togetherness, and that want to put something behind us. The committment was tremendous. It was a real man's game tonight,' purred Keegan. No-one gave you anything - you had to earn it. Our destiny is in our own hands now and you can't ask for more than that. </p> <p>'A lot of people have waited a long time for this and I am so proud I was in charge when it happened.

Those three words are increasingly a cause of dread, as the massive growth in emails becomes yet another source of anxiety for the nation's stressed-out office workers. </p> <p>For most people, email is a wonderful invention - an efficient way of communicating that is instant, direct, and costs virtually nothing. The problem comes when those emails start building up in your in-box and you become a victim of information overload. It is stressful trying to respond to hundreds of messages, and the danger is that a really vital one will get lost. </p> <p> A recent UK survey found that users are now spending three hours a day reading and composing emails - twice as long as a couple of years earlier. It is believed that in the US, more emails are sent every day - some 300 million - than letters.</p> <p> On this side of the Atlantic, a study by the Institute of Management earlier this year found that email is now identified as the tenth-greatest cause of stress in the workplace. The most stressful aspect of email is, most would agree, the sheer volume of it. One journalist, returning from a two-week holiday in Cuba recently, found 400 emails awaiting him in two inboxes. It took him a day to work his way through them, deleting many without even opening them. Receiving 20 or 30 emails a day is now commonplace, and some peo ple - particularly at hi-tech companies such as Microsoft - are used to receiving hundreds a day. </p> <p>Elizabeth Lank of IT services company ICL, says: 'I would guess I get 30 or 40 a day. But when you really feel the pain is when you've been out of the office for more than a day, and they start mounting up. The thing I find really stressful is that I feel very bad if I don't respond to somebody - it doesn't seem very professional.' </p> <p>As a result, she says, she often spends time on Sunday evening going through the previous week's unanswered emails, to avoid starting the week with unresolved mail. She finds the best way to cope with large numbers of emails on a daily basis is to automatically prioritise incoming mails according to colour.</p> <p> 'Anything I've been copied on is probably for information purposes only, so in the email program I have set up that is in yellow, while emails sent only to me are in blue. Anything I get from the chief executive is in red, to ensure important messages don't get lost.' </p> <p> Mark Hastings, policy director at the Institute of Management, says it is not just the volume of emails that is a problem; their instantaneous nature also causes stress. 'People think they need to respond instantly, so they get involved in a kind of corporate tennis match, where they are lob bing messages backwards and forwards over the net,' he explains. One tactic he suggests is sending a 'holding' email, which acknowledges the message and promises to get back with a more detailed response later.</p> <p> 'You need to schedule dealing with emails into your working day and stick rigorously to the time you have set aside,' he says. Perhaps the greatest culprits in the proliferation of emails are people who copy their messages to all and sundry, when this is simply not necessary. Why do they do this? Imogen Daniels, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, says: 'It's largely an anxiety thing: wanting to make sure that everyone has all the information.' </p> <p> Emails are also a convenient way to cover your back in an environment where office politics are rife, but in some cases the proliferation is simply the result of thoughtlessness. Lank says: 'Ask yourself who really needs this information.' At ICL, she has taken charge of the 'global' email facility, so anybody who wants to send a message to everyone in the company has to ask permission first. Most can quickly be persuaded that there is a way of targeting the message more efficiently, she says. </p> <p>Hastings at the Institute of Management suggests that if companies really want to get the best from their employees, rather than making their lives more stressed, they should have an explicit policy advising people on how to use the email system. Many companies do have an email policy, but it tends to focus on issues such as security, viruses and material, rather than email etiquette. Hastings says the policy should outline the types of messages that should be sent by email, and the acceptable time in which somebody should respond. He adds that companies could also provide staff with basic training on how to manage their inbox. </p> <p>With WAP-enabled mobile phones becoming more common, and broadband communications being introduced by airlines later this year, getting away from email will become almost impossible. 'Psychologically, the feeling that you are constantly accessible can be very stressful in itself,' says Hastings. </p> <p> Nevertheless, according to Winston Fletcher, communications director of advertising agency FCB Europe, some people make themselves a martyr to their inbox. He says: 'You hear about people who, even if they get an email when they are out on a Saturday night, will answer it promptly when they get back. It shows that you are wanted, that you are loved, and to that extent it is flattering. But you should only reply when you are ready to do so.' For all its undoubted advantages, email is, in any case, not always the best way to communicate. IPD's Daniels says:</p> <p> 'I seriously wonder whether it's the best way to consult with somebody, because you simply end up going back and forth. Sometimes it may be simpler to just pick up the phone and talk.'</p>",

      "byline": "Virginia Wallis",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's not often that you feel sorry for insurers. But it does seem a little unfair that they are having to shoulder the whole of the expensive administrative burden of sorting out the endowment mortgage mess. After all, if lenders and other mortgage advisers hadn't been quite so keen to pocket the commission from helping to sell endowments, the insurers would not now be having to write to thousands of policyholders to tell them whether or not their endowments are on track to pay off their mortgage loans. </p> <p>As well as not helping out with the costs of all that extra correspondence, many lenders - including nine of the largest 10 - are adding to insurers' woes by refusing to put any more endowment business their way. And there's little comfort to be had from the endowment-friendly lenders that are left. Now that they have to prove that an endowment is 'demonstrably better than a repayment mortgage' the chances of them making a sale are slim. It's a shame isn't it? But don't get your hankies out just yet. There is still plenty of other mortgage-related insurance that lenders are happy to sell. And they're pretty good at it. </p> <p>Even though many lenders have moved away from insisting that borrowers buy house insurance from them, they still manage to sell nearly 40 per cent of all household insurance in the UK. How? By 'capitalising on customer inertia and the point-of-sale advantage of mortgage provision,' say the market analysts at Datamonitor. </p> <p>But it's not simply that mortgage customers are sitting targets. According to Patrick Bunton of London and Country Mortgages, in such a fiercely competitive mortgage market, 'you can take it as read that lenders will be pushing as hard as they can to sell peripheral products'. </p> <p>Lenders are going to have to try harder if they are to meet their target of selling mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI). Also known as accident, sickness and unemployment benefit, MPPI pays your mortgage for up to a year if you lose your job or your earnings suffer as a result of illness. The aim is to get at least 55 per cent of borrowers to buy it by 2001. But despite Government help with the marketing of MPPI, lenders are still less than half way there. </p> <p>Making its purchase compulsory would increase the take-up but, because compulsory insurance now has to be included when calculating the Annual Percentage Rate, that would make mortgage rates look less attractive. It also wouldn't be fair on those consumers for whom MPPI is unsuitable. </p> <p>An alternative would be to follow the example set by the small Market Harborough Building Society, where 76 per cent of customers have bought MPPI. Recognising that insurance which can help to prevent mortgage arrears benefits both borrower and lender, the Market Harborough sells MPPI at cost. This society, despite its lack of financial clout, has negotiated a deal with CGU which enables it to charge customers \u00a31.50 for every \u00a3100 of cover. This is nearly four times cheaper than the average \u00a35.45 charged by other lenders. Over the 25-year life of the loan - assuming a monthly mortgage payment of \u00a3500 - that difference could represent nearly \u00a36,000 profit. </p> <p>There are also healthy prof its in selling lump-sum mortgage protection in the form of life and critical illness insurance. And there's an added bonus from persuading customers to buy these products for lenders who want to sell endowment mortgages or those backed by life insurance Isas. </p> <p>Because life and critical illness insurance can be cheaper when bought as part of this sort of package, it is much easier for a lender to show that recommending an endowment (or life insurance Isa) rather than a repayment mortgage was reasonable advice. </p> <p>If a customer didn't want life and critical illness cover, a lender would be hard-pressed to show that the investment-backed mortgage was 'demonstrably better' than a repayment version. </p> <p>As well as costing more, that customer would be tied to buying life insurance he or she didn't need. However, once life and critical illness insurance are brought into the equation, the investment option can be made to appear to be as good - if not better - than the repayment option. </p> <p><strong>Must haves, and the rest</strong></p> <p>Lenders would be failing in their duty if they didn't tell you about all the different types of insurance they can sell you, because it's a requirement of the Mortgage Code. But unless - as they are also required to do - they tell you the insurance is a compulsory part of the mortgage package, it's up to you whether you buy what's on offer. So which of the following do you really need?</p> <p><strong> Buildings insurance</strong> <br> This is a must. Without a suitable policy, you won't get your mortgage. If you're allowed to arrange your own insurance, make sure that it's in place from the date you exchange contracts, and that you insure for the 'reinstatement' value of your home (usually given in the lender's valuation) rather than for the purchase price. If you don't, you risk having the lender's policy foisted upon you. </p> <p><strong> Contents cover</strong> <br> Existentialists may not agree, but cover for your possessions is worth having if you would prefer someone else to pick up the bill for replacing , or repairing, your belongings if they are lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. If you are moving, you'll need a fresh policy for your new home. While you arrange this, it's worth checking whether your belongings are covered while in transit. If they are, it's unlikely that you'll need the insurance that your removal firm is bound to offer you. </p> <p><strong> Your life</strong> <br> Lenders like you to have life insurance because it pays off the mortgage if you die, and saves them the bother of having to sell the property to get their money back. Paying for life insurance is unavoidable if you choose an interest-only mortgage backed by an endowment policy, or the more flexible alternative of a life insurance Individual Savings Account (Isa). But with other sorts of interest-only loans, or a repayment mortgage, you usually have a choice. If you are unattached and dependant-free, you don't need life cover. If you have a joint mortgage and/or children, you probably do. </p> <p><strong> Critical illness pay-outs</strong> <br> What do you sell the single person who won't buy life insurance? The answer is critical illness cover, or serious illness insurance. Widely regarded by the industry as even more important than life cover, critical illness policies pay out a lump sum if you are diagnosed as having one of a defined list of life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions, such as cancer, a heart attack, multiple sclerosis and loss of limbs, eyesight, hearing or speech. Whether you need it or not depends on several factors: the likelihood of serious illness striking before your mortgage is paid off; how it would affect your household's finances; and what other resources you have. </p> <p><strong> Life and illness insurance</strong> <br> One of the main drawbacks of critical illness insurance is that, typically, it will not pay out if you die within 28 days of the diagnosis of a serious illness. To plug this gap, many lenders sell policies which combine life and critical illness cover. If you decide you need both types of insurance, combined cover tends to be cheaper than buying separately.</p> <p><strong> Mortgage protection cover</strong> <br> Lenders have government blessing to push this type of insurance, but if your ability to meet your mortgage repayments would be unaffected by illness or unemployment, you don't need it. </p> <p>If you're self-employed, having cover that pays out if you're too ill to earn could be useful, but you're unlikely to benefit from unemployment cover unless you're prepared to close your business. </p> <p>If you are an employee and your boss offers a decent sick pay scheme, you probably don't need the sickness cover. You are unlikely to benefit from it, either, if you are over 64, already out of work, do fewer than 16 hours a week, have not been in continuous employment for at least six months or are a contract worker. </p> <p><strong> Reassuring your lender</strong> <br> If you need to borrow a higher percentage of the value of your home than your lender thinks is wise, they may be prepared to go ahead only if you pay a high fee for an insurance policy, called a mortgage indemnity guarantee. This protects the lender from the risk of not being able to recover the full loan if you fall into arrears and the place has to be repossessed. </p> <p>You won't face this fee if you borrow less than 75 per cent of the valuation (unless you borrow from Paragon Mortgages which starts charging if you borrow more than 70 per cent). Many lenders don't levy it until you borrow more than 90 per cent of the valuation (although Barclays makes you pay if you borrow more than 80 per cent). Once you go over the lender's limit, you face a charge of between 5 and 9 per cent of the difference between 75 per cent of the valuation and the amount of your loan. </p> <p>With a mortgage of \u00a395,000 on a property valued at \u00a3100,000, paying for your lender's peace of mind could cost anything from \u00a31,450 to \u00a31,790. If you can't pay it up front, the fee is added to the loan, so you end up paying interest on it too. </p> <p>This is 'totally unfair', says Melanie Green, senior Researcher at Which? 'Consumers have no option to pay in instalments, you can't shop around for a cheaper policy and you're unlikely to get a refund if you move after a few years, even though the policy covers the full mortgage term.' </p> <p>If you don't have the cash to put down a sufficiently large deposit to avoid the fee, the only other way of dodging this unwelcome cost is to take out your mortgage with one of the increasing number of lenders which don't charge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's not often that you feel sorry for insurers. But it does seem a little unfair that they are having to shoulder the whole of the expensive administrative burden of sorting out the endowment mortgage mess. After all, if lenders and other mortgage advisers hadn't been quite so keen to pocket the commission from helping to sell endowments, the insurers would not now be having to write to thousands of policyholders to tell them whether or not their endowments are on track to pay off their mortgage loans. As well as not helping out with the costs of all that extra correspondence, many lenders - including nine of the largest 10 - are adding to insurers' woes by refusing to put any more endowment business their way. And there's little comfort to be had from the endowment-friendly lenders that are left. Now that they have to prove that an endowment is 'demonstrably better than a repayment mortgage' the chances of them making a sale are slim. It's a shame isn't it? But don't get your hankies out just yet. There is still plenty of other mortgage-related insurance that lenders are happy to sell. And they're pretty good at it. Even though many lenders have moved away from insisting that borrowers buy house insurance from them, they still manage to sell nearly 40 per cent of all household insurance in the UK. How? By 'capitalising on customer inertia and the point-of-sale advantage of mortgage provision,' say the market analysts at Datamonitor. But it's not simply that mortgage customers are sitting targets. According to Patrick Bunton of London and Country Mortgages, in such a fiercely competitive mortgage market, 'you can take it as read that lenders will be pushing as hard as they can to sell peripheral products'. Lenders are going to have to try harder if they are to meet their target of selling mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI). Also known as accident, sickness and unemployment benefit, MPPI pays your mortgage for up to a year if you lose your job or your earnings suffer as a result of illness. The aim is to get at least 55 per cent of borrowers to buy it by 2001. But despite Government help with the marketing of MPPI, lenders are still less than half way there. Making its purchase compulsory would increase the take-up but, because compulsory insurance now has to be included when calculating the Annual Percentage Rate, that would make mortgage rates look less attractive. It also wouldn't be fair on those consumers for whom MPPI is unsuitable. An alternative would be to follow the example set by the small Market Harborough Building Society, where 76 per cent of customers have bought MPPI. Recognising that insurance which can help to prevent mortgage arrears benefits both borrower and lender, the Market Harborough sells MPPI at cost. This society, despite its lack of financial clout, has negotiated a deal with CGU which enables it to charge customers \u00a31.50 for every \u00a3100 of cover. This is nearly four times cheaper than the average \u00a35.45 charged by other lenders. Over the 25-year life of the loan - assuming a monthly mortgage payment of \u00a3500 - that difference could represent nearly \u00a36,000 profit. There are also healthy prof its in selling lump-sum mortgage protection in the form of life and critical illness insurance. And there's an added bonus from persuading customers to buy these products for lenders who want to sell endowment mortgages or those backed by life insurance Isas. Because life and critical illness insurance can be cheaper when bought as part of this sort of package, it is much easier for a lender to show that recommending an endowment (or life insurance Isa) rather than a repayment mortgage was reasonable advice. If a customer didn't want life and critical illness cover, a lender would be hard-pressed to show that the investment-backed mortgage was 'demonstrably better' than a repayment version. As well as costing more, that customer would be tied to buying life insurance he or she didn't need. However, once life and critical illness insurance are brought into the equation, the investment option can be made to appear to be as good - if not better - than the repayment option. Must haves, and the rest Lenders would be failing in their duty if they didn't tell you about all the different types of insurance they can sell you, because it's a requirement of the Mortgage Code. But unless - as they are also required to do - they tell you the insurance is a compulsory part of the mortgage package, it's up to you whether you buy what's on offer. So which of the following do you really need? Buildings insurance This is a must. Without a suitable policy, you won't get your mortgage. If you're allowed to arrange your own insurance, make sure that it's in place from the date you exchange contracts, and that you insure for the 'reinstatement' value of your home (usually given in the lender's valuation) rather than for the purchase price. If you don't, you risk having the lender's policy foisted upon you. Contents cover Existentialists may not agree, but cover for your possessions is worth having if you would prefer someone else to pick up the bill for replacing , or repairing, your belongings if they are lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. If you are moving, you'll need a fresh policy for your new home. While you arrange this, it's worth checking whether your belongings are covered while in transit. If they are, it's unlikely that you'll need the insurance that your removal firm is bound to offer you. Your life Lenders like you to have life insurance because it pays off the mortgage if you die, and saves them the bother of having to sell the property to get their money back. Paying for life insurance is unavoidable if you choose an interest-only mortgage backed by an endowment policy, or the more flexible alternative of a life insurance Individual Savings Account (Isa). But with other sorts of interest-only loans, or a repayment mortgage, you usually have a choice. If you are unattached and dependant-free, you don't need life cover. If you have a joint mortgage and/or children, you probably do. Critical illness pay-outs What do you sell the single person who won't buy life insurance? The answer is critical illness cover, or serious illness insurance. Widely regarded by the industry as even more important than life cover, critical illness policies pay out a lump sum if you are diagnosed as having one of a defined list of life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions, such as cancer, a heart attack, multiple sclerosis and loss of limbs, eyesight, hearing or speech. Whether you need it or not depends on several factors: the likelihood of serious illness striking before your mortgage is paid off; how it would affect your household's finances; and what other resources you have. Life and illness insurance One of the main drawbacks of critical illness insurance is that, typically, it will not pay out if you die within 28 days of the diagnosis of a serious illness. To plug this gap, many lenders sell policies which combine life and critical illness cover. If you decide you need both types of insurance, combined cover tends to be cheaper than buying separately. Mortgage protection cover Lenders have government blessing to push this type of insurance, but if your ability to meet your mortgage repayments would be unaffected by illness or unemployment, you don't need it. If you're self-employed, having cover that pays out if you're too ill to earn could be useful, but you're unlikely to benefit from unemployment cover unless you're prepared to close your business. If you are an employee and your boss offers a decent sick pay scheme, you probably don't need the sickness cover. You are unlikely to benefit from it, either, if you are over 64, already out of work, do fewer than 16 hours a week, have not been in continuous employment for at least six months or are a contract worker. Reassuring your lender If you need to borrow a higher percentage of the value of your home than your lender thinks is wise, they may be prepared to go ahead only if you pay a high fee for an insurance policy, called a mortgage indemnity guarantee. This protects the lender from the risk of not being able to recover the full loan if you fall into arrears and the place has to be repossessed. You won't face this fee if you borrow less than 75 per cent of the valuation (unless you borrow from Paragon Mortgages which starts charging if you borrow more than 70 per cent). Many lenders don't levy it until you borrow more than 90 per cent of the valuation (although Barclays makes you pay if you borrow more than 80 per cent). Once you go over the lender's limit, you face a charge of between 5 and 9 per cent of the difference between 75 per cent of the valuation and the amount of your loan. With a mortgage of \u00a395,000 on a property valued at \u00a3100,000, paying for your lender's peace of mind could cost anything from \u00a31,450 to \u00a31,790. If you can't pay it up front, the fee is added to the loan, so you end up paying interest on it too. This is 'totally unfair', says Melanie Green, senior Researcher at Which? 'Consumers have no option to pay in instalments, you can't shop around for a cheaper policy and you're unlikely to get a refund if you move after a few years, even though the policy covers the full mortgage term.' If you don't have the cash to put down a sufficiently large deposit to avoid the fee, the only other way of dodging this unwelcome cost is to take out your mortgage with one of the increasing number of lenders which don't charge.",

      "body": "<p>You may not realise it, but if you are one of the country's 11 million mortgage borrowers, life is getting riskier for you. The legal and practical situation of homeowners who get behind with their loan repayments is becoming more precarious. </p> <p>In theory the lot of homeowners has improved since the height of the negative equity crisis in 1991, when 75,000 homes were repossessed. The mortgage code, for instance, which came into force three years ago, requires lenders to deal 'sympathetically and positively' with borrowers who get into arrears. </p> <p>But, speaking about the bad old days of 1991, Sue Edwards, London money advice adviser for the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab), says: 'If the same situation were to happen again, we'd have a lot more repossessions.' </p> <p>There are two particularly worrying developments. Most lenders are accused of being harsh in their repossession policies. And, for its part, the Government is about to reduce the financial support it gives to indebted homeowners. </p> <p>In a highly controversial move in October 1995, the Conservatives lengthened from four to nine months the period in which homeowners claiming state benefits would still have to make their own mortgage payments after they signed on. </p> <p>The Labour government, in housing legislation which could be introduced this autumn, plans to extend the period before Income Support for Mortgage Payments (ISMI) becomes payable to 14 months.

(Mortgage lenders are often wary of this route - but a court will sometimes give you a stay of execution if you have proof that the property is on the market.)

      "bodyText": "You may not realise it, but if you are one of the country's 11 million mortgage borrowers, life is getting riskier for you. The legal and practical situation of homeowners who get behind with their loan repayments is becoming more precarious. In theory the lot of homeowners has improved since the height of the negative equity crisis in 1991, when 75,000 homes were repossessed. The mortgage code, for instance, which came into force three years ago, requires lenders to deal 'sympathetically and positively' with borrowers who get into arrears. But, speaking about the bad old days of 1991, Sue Edwards, London money advice adviser for the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab), says: 'If the same situation were to happen again, we'd have a lot more repossessions.' There are two particularly worrying developments. Most lenders are accused of being harsh in their repossession policies. And, for its part, the Government is about to reduce the financial support it gives to indebted homeowners. In a highly controversial move in October 1995, the Conservatives lengthened from four to nine months the period in which homeowners claiming state benefits would still have to make their own mortgage payments after they signed on. The Labour government, in housing legislation which could be introduced this autumn, plans to extend the period before Income Support for Mortgage Payments (ISMI) becomes payable to 14 months. The proposal was recently outlined its housing green paper. The 14-month period was chosen because, the government says, homeowners should all buy mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) and this will cover them. Although Nacab has serious concerns about MPPI, it is recommending that homeowners buy these policies - because you will almost definitely be repossessed if you cannot continue your mortgage payments for this period. However, citizens' advice bureau files are littered with examples of people whose MPPI claims are turned down by insurers. There are major obstacles to claiming: if you are self-employed, for instance, and your business gets into trouble. You can be excluded if you become unemployed soon after starting the policy, and if your difficulties are caused by some sort of mental breakdown, you will also have trouble claiming.

'There's no industry sector which won't be affected,' he says. 'Within a few years, if it isn't an internet business it won't be a business at all.' </p> <p>Yet it is striking how much the internet owes not to business, but to its origins in the academic world and the libertarian hacker culture. </p> <p>From these roots the internet draws its awesome flexibility and ability to reconfig ure itself around obstacles, and its self-regulating nature outside government control.

These are the ones which will be taken into the US,' he says - a positive development because, while all new applications in the US are driven by commerce, in Europe the possibilities will be defined also by public services and even social movements, allowing a wider range of uses to appear. </p> <p>Can the Old World take part in and share the benefits of the virtuous 'new economy' of which Silicon Valley is the symbol? Castells insists it is not only possible but inevitable. Europe may not yet match the astonishing, unprecedented 5 per cent productivity growth racked up by the US in the last quarter of 1999. But that's partly because of inevitable lags and the failure of unreformed statistics to reflect the improvements.The main point, says Castells, is that the new economy's methods and techniques are spreading through Europe at amazing speed - that's what happens in global info-capitalism. Indeed, that's what globalisation is . </p> <p>In a relatively short time, therefore, Europe will converge on the US both in internet diffusion and usage and in pockets of productivity growth. Already the European labour force, except in Germany, is much more flexible than it is often given credit for.

England have been humbled by West Indian pacemen for the last three decades; for half that time Courtney Walsh has been hounding them. At the age of 37 he still is. </p> <p>Bolstered by a massive first-innings lead of 218, Walsh despatched the first three English batsmen in half-an hour to register Test wickets 455 to 457. He had the decency to do much of the damage while Channel 4 were at the racing to save patriotic viewers from enduring yet more humiliation.</p> <p>It's tempting to say that Walsh ripped through the English upper order because that's what we always used to say about him, but that is not strictly true. He has made some concessions to age; his bowling now clocks in around the 80mph mark. No matter; he's still too much for England. By tea they were crumbling on 71 for 5 and yet another blank Birmingham Sunday was in the offing. </p> <p>Nowadays Walsh rarely terrifies - he could in the past- but especially when he discovers a pitch where the ball grips, where the bounce is uneven; he flicks his wrist, the ball lands on the seam and it moves. He doesn't bother to try to bowl fast. Bumpers are a waste of energy, only to be used when the wicket is 'sleeping'. </p> <p>In this match England have bowled far more bouncers than their opponents and it's obvious why. The wicket 'slept' when Gough and Co were in the field. It was wide awake for Walsh. Unlike Curtly Ambrose, Walsh has not promised to retire after this series. Who knows? England go to the Caribbean in 2004. He'll only be 41 then. </p> <p>Walsh and Ambrose, who has also bowled superbly with the ridiculous reward of only one wicket so far, have shown that class and know-how are more important than youth and pace. They have exploited the conditions expertly. The surface at Edgbaston is not ideal. As is often the case Edgbaston has produced a truncated Test which has cost the ECB and the English game a lot of money. They are good at marketing here; the ground has been just about full for the last two days; they are not so good at preparing a decent Test pitch, something the ECB should consider a lot more seriously when they allocate their internationals. </p> <p>This is not to excuse England's performance or to deny the West Indies absolute superiority in this game. England have been outplayed in every area - except perhaps catching (the West Indies put down a couple yesterday afternoon). </p> <p>The tourists have made rapid progress since Roger Harper and Jimmy Adams have taken the helm. Before arriving at Edgbaston they had lost 10 consecutive Tests away from the Caribbean. No wonder they all look forward to coming to England. All the signs of a cohesive and committed side are there: the batsmen down the order grit their teeth and hang in; the fielders dive here, there and everywhere and the old lags, eager to help, have a spring in the step. The West Indies are coming back </p> <p>England were supposed to travelling a similar journey. That was the spin after the victory at Lord's against Zimbabwe. Since then they have stalled and here they looked stagnant, their batsmen hesitant and too easily cowed by the old names on the opposition scorecard, their bowlers innocuous - with the exception of Darren Gough in a couple of spells on Friday.</p> <p>It took them all morning to take the last three West Indian wickets. Gough's inswinging yorker accounted for Franklyn Rose, whose 48 was skittish and highly entertaining. </p> <p>But Reon King was able to last 40 balls in support of his captain Adams, who scented a hundred. King was finally undone by Robert Croft, who had bowled tidily throughout, when he dragged his back foot out of his crease much to Alec Stewart's delight. </p> <p>So Adams needed 11 for his hundred when Walsh appeared. The expert number 11 could not be moved (this was his 56th Test not out - a world record) but Adams' innings ended two short of his century thanks to a stunning catch by Andrew Flintoff at cover. Adams cracked a drive off Gough and Flintoff flung out his right hand. To the satisfaction of both parties the catch was held (it wasn't so obvious from the TV replays). </p> <p>This was the last time the English team smiled in the oppressive Birmingham heat. For Walsh set to work in the afternoon session. His first wicket was an easy one. Mark Ramprakash, stuck on the crease to a straight ball, missed it and was lbw. It was not obvious why he missed it; it did not appear a devilish delivery. </p> <p>Nasser Hussain might have been out twice before groping against Walsh. First the ball took the shoulder of the bat from a rearing delivery from Ambrose and then sped through the hands of Brian Lara at first slip, who might have caught it. Then Hussain mistimed an on-drive against Walsh into and out of the hands of King, who most definitely should have caught it. Then the edge to Ridley Jacobs who made no mistake; this was not the pitch nor the attack for Hussain to recover his form. </p> <p>Now Graeme Hick registered his first pair in first class cricket. He may have been unlucky on two counts. He received a snorter from Walsh, which pitched leg and sailed over the top of off stump; moreover the ball was deemed to have brushed Hicks's bat or glove on the way through, which was not obvious. Stewart bristled as usual while acquiring his eight runs, but was out in similar fashion to the first innings forcing away from his body and dragging the ball on to his stumps. </p> <p>Mike Atherton was bloody-minded enough to see off the spells of Walsh and Ambrose; so was infuriated when an attempted cut shot against King ricocheted onto his stumps. </p> <p>When Flintoff was bowled by King and Croft caught at short leg the score was 83 for 7, the contest was over.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>He is the most courteous of enemies. \"I'm looking forward to seeing Kevin Keegan again,\" Erich Ribbeck said yesterday, \"and I'm happy that he, too, is going to contribute to making this a football match and not a war. It's vital that those responsible don't lose control and keep this as what it should be, a sporting encounter.\" </p> <p>Most of Ribbeck's recent wars have been of the civil variety, in which he has been opposed by those among his compatriots - sometimes even from inside his own squad - who disapprove of his tactics and his selection policy. Handsome, tanned, silver-haired, the 63-year-old coach also has a nice line in civilised irony, which came in useful this week when deflecting criticism of his side's first appearance in Euro 2000, a limp, error-strewn 1-1 draw with Romania. But the sense of humour momentarily drained away when he was invited to say whether, despite the outside world's judgment that this is the worst Germany team in living memory, he still believes that there is a great, or even a good, side within his squad - and, if so, to speculate on the conditions under which it might emerge. </p> <p>After the question had been translated, there was a pause of fully 10 seconds, at the end of which he drew a deep breath. \"Sometimes it's a great advantage if people underestimate you,\" he said quietly, looking down. A five-second pause, and he raised his eyes to his questioner. \"We played our qualifying matches, and we came first in the group. We lost just one match, in Turkey. Other nations only came second in their group. So when I make those comparisons, I realise we can't be that bad.\" </p> <p>Point taken, most of all by the English, although it hardly explains his offer to resign after the 3-0 defeat by the United States in Florida in February 1999, when he was only six months into the job, or the 2-1 defeat by Holland in Amsterdam last February, Germany's first reverse on Dutch soil in 75 years, or the dreadful performance against Romania. The questions wouldn't go away, most of them dealing with the cacophony of complaints surfacing from within the squad, usually to do with his loyalty to the 39-year-old Lothar Matth\u00e4us. But the coach, a relaxed Rhinelander whose fastidious manners long ago earned him the nickname \"Sir Erich\", kept on giving answers, always realistic and interesting, occasionally diversionary, sometimes cleverly conciliatory while refusing to give ground. </p> <p>For example, how did he respond to the demand of his centre-half, Jens Nowotny, for more responsibility - a coded plea for the removal of Matth\u00e4us? \"I don't blame him for saying that. I expect players to want responsibility. I don't need also-rans in the team. And responsibility covers all areas - be a good team member, don't lose your one-on-ones, don't pass the ball to the opposition. You can inter pret responsibility in a thousand different ways. Some people interpret it as criticising your team-mates, which is not the right way.\" </p> <p>Internecine warfare is hardly what we expect of Germany. The once-envied system which produced a seamless succession of respected coaches appears finally to have broken down. But is Erich Ribbeck the problem, or he is merely the victim of a shallow pool of footballing talent? </p> <p>Yesterday he announced the selection of the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler on the right flank, and felt forced to make a joke about it. \"How old was Michael Owen when he made his first start for England? Eighteen? Well, I hope you won't reproach me by suggesting that I've left it two years too late to pick Deisler.\" And then he turned serious. \"We should be happy to have a young player with such potential. By giving him an opportunity to play in such a crucial match, I hope to set a trend for the whole of German football. If back home there are kids of 12 or 13 who see that you don't have to wait for a chance with the national team until you're 26 or 27 or 29, it might give them the incentive to keep on trying to realise their dream.\" </p> <p>Ribbeck was by no means the first choice of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund when Berti Vogts, the man at the helm when Germany won Euro 96, stepped down after his team crashed 3-0 to Croatia in the World Cup two years later. In fact he was in semi-retirement. An undistinguished defender with Wuppertal, his coaching career started under the wing of Hennes Weisweiler at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the mid-60s before he moved on to Rot-Weiss Essen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Kaiserslautern, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen, with whom he won the Uefa Cup in 1988, his only major honour. </p> <p><strong> Team spirit</strong><br> </p> <p> It was not long after he took over from Vogts that the internal cracks started to appear. \"I think it was easier in the past to create an absolute team spirit,\" he said rather wistfully this week, \"but with the media interests becoming ever stronger, the egoistic side of the players comes through more clearly. I spoke to Uwe Seeler and Horst Hrubesch, who represent two generations of German international players, and they both confirmed that in their time things were different and easier to handle.\" </p> <p>To his critics inside Germany, the fact that the coach has managed to hang on to his humanity and his realism is of little interest. \"We will try to erase as many mistakes as possible,\" he said this week on the subject of his team's new habit of giving the ball away. \"On the other hand, football lives off its mistakes. They are part of the game.\" And when challenged on his team's dispirited play against Romania, he responded: \"I don't know whether you can increase players' motivation. It has to be strong anyway.\" He is right on both counts, of course. And yet not quite right enough for some people. </p> <p>The problems he faces were exposed when Oliver Kahn, his goalkeeper, talked about the defensive lapses that forced him into several one-on-one contests with onrushing Romanian forwards. \"This isn't only a problem in defence,\" Kahn said. \"Defensive work begins further up front. You just have to play with more commitment and, let's face it, with more heart in midfield. Because if these guys do their work properly, the defence and I aren't put in so much difficulty.\" </p> <p>Conceding an early goal, Kahn said, had given the team \"a serious mental problem. It destroys everything that you planned for. But having said that, if you put your national team shirt on it should be clear to everyone that you must fight for your country, run for your country, and give your all for that shirt. Playing with more heart and with your country in mind would already be a big step forward.\" </p> <p>Just imagine that - a team in the shirts of Germany playing without pride, and one of their players admitting it. But Keegan and England would be unwise to count on benefiting from the same phenomenon this evening. </p> <p>\"Our next opponent,\" Ribbeck said yesterday, rather pointedly, \"is a team that is proud of its tradition. And we must not lose.\"</p>",

I expect players to want responsibility. I don't need also-rans in the team. And responsibility covers all areas - be a good team member, don't lose your one-on-ones, don't pass the ball to the opposition. You can inter pret responsibility in a thousand different ways. Some people interpret it as criticising your team-mates, which is not the right way.\" Internecine warfare is hardly what we expect of Germany. The once-envied system which produced a seamless succession of respected coaches appears finally to have broken down. But is Erich Ribbeck the problem, or he is merely the victim of a shallow pool of footballing talent? Yesterday he announced the selection of the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler on the right flank, and felt forced to make a joke about it. \"How old was Michael Owen when he made his first start for England? Eighteen? Well, I hope you won't reproach me by suggesting that I've left it two years too late to pick Deisler.\" And then he turned serious. \"We should be happy to have a young player with such potential. By giving him an opportunity to play in such a crucial match, I hope to set a trend for the whole of German football. If back home there are kids of 12 or 13 who see that you don't have to wait for a chance with the national team until you're 26 or 27 or 29, it might give them the incentive to keep on trying to realise their dream.\" Ribbeck was by no means the first choice of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund when Berti Vogts, the man at the helm when Germany won Euro 96, stepped down after his team crashed 3-0 to Croatia in the World Cup two years later. In fact he was in semi-retirement. An undistinguished defender with Wuppertal, his coaching career started under the wing of Hennes Weisweiler at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the mid-60s before he moved on to Rot-Weiss Essen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Kaiserslautern, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen, with whom he won the Uefa Cup in 1988, his only major honour. Team spirit It was not long after he took over from Vogts that the internal cracks started to appear. \"I think it was easier in the past to create an absolute team spirit,\" he said rather wistfully this week, \"but with the media interests becoming ever stronger, the egoistic side of the players comes through more clearly. I spoke to Uwe Seeler and Horst Hrubesch, who represent two generations of German international players, and they both confirmed that in their time things were different and easier to handle.\" To his critics inside Germany, the fact that the coach has managed to hang on to his humanity and his realism is of little interest. \"We will try to erase as many mistakes as possible,\" he said this week on the subject of his team's new habit of giving the ball away. \"On the other hand, football lives off its mistakes. They are part of the game.\" And when challenged on his team's dispirited play against Romania, he responded: \"I don't know whether you can increase players' motivation. It has to be strong anyway.\" He is right on both counts, of course. And yet not quite right enough for some people. The problems he faces were exposed when Oliver Kahn, his goalkeeper, talked about the defensive lapses that forced him into several one-on-one contests with onrushing Romanian forwards. \"This isn't only a problem in defence,\" Kahn said. \"Defensive work begins further up front. You just have to play with more commitment and, let's face it, with more heart in midfield. Because if these guys do their work properly, the defence and I aren't put in so much difficulty.\" Conceding an early goal, Kahn said, had given the team \"a serious mental problem. It destroys everything that you planned for. But having said that, if you put your national team shirt on it should be clear to everyone that you must fight for your country, run for your country, and give your all for that shirt. Playing with more heart and with your country in mind would already be a big step forward.\" Just imagine that - a team in the shirts of Germany playing without pride, and one of their players admitting it. But Keegan and England would be unwise to count on benefiting from the same phenomenon this evening. \"Our next opponent,\" Ribbeck said yesterday, rather pointedly, \"is a team that is proud of its tradition. And we must not lose.\"",

The ball is cleared.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Campbell comes to blows with Jancker again, and gives away a free kick. Scholl takes the kick and a flicked header from Jens Jeremies lands on the roof of Seaman's net.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> A long throw from Gary Neville finds Shearer's head. His flick-on runs across the six-yard line untouched, but Paul Scholes salvages the ball, scoops it back into the box and England win a corner off Nowotny. Again the corner ends up at the feet of Sol Campbell, who loses the ball and fouls Jancker again into the bargain.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> Sebastian Deisler displays the game's first piece of skill, jinking past Dennis Wise on the right wing and firing in a low cross beyond the outstretched Phil Neville. Campbell clears for the corner.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> More German pressure ends with a long shot from Dietmar Hamann - which forces Seaman onto his knees to save. No real danger for England as yet, but the Germans have certainly started the game better.

A violent scream of disagreement can be heard to emanate from the young Liverpool striker.</p> <p><strong>23</strong> Jeremies slices open England's flat back four and releases Scholl into the box. But, with only Seaman to beat, Scholl fires tamely into the ground and Seaman saves. More worrying signs.</p> <p><strong>24</strong> Scholes beats Jens Jeremies wonderfully, dragging the ball around and past the Bayern Munich man. He then finds Michael Owen on the right wing, but Owen's cross is poor.</p> <p><strong>25</strong> Another striking chance for Germany, and again it's easy for Seaman. But England are both sitting off the German midfield as they attack, and defending in numbers - not an ideal combination.</p> <p><strong>29</strong> Another cross from Scholl forces Scholes to head out for a corner.</p> <p><strong>32</strong> Another German corner. Cleared this time by Keown, but with only two men upfield, the ball heads swiftly back into German possession. England are seeing less of the ball than they did against Portugal - but still no chances for either side.</p> <p><strong>34</strong> Correction. A hopeful long ball from Dennis Wise is cleared for an England throw. The throw goes to Phil Neville whose right-footed cross (natch) finds the head of Michael Owen. Owen connects with both power and positioning, and Kahn can only push the ball onto the post. Thankfully for the Germans, the ball bobbles to safety.</p> <p><strong>35</strong> Scholes drives from 30 yards. The shot, reminiscent of his goal against Middlesbrough for Manchester United, just dips too late to sneak under the bar.</p> <p><strong>39</strong> England's best movement of the match. Wise plays a crossfield pass to Gary Neville, who feeds Scholes, who passes to Ince, who releases Alan Shearer into the box. Instead of shooting however, Shearer opts to lay the ball back square to Ince. The ball is easily intercepted by Nowotny, but this is better from England.</p> <p><strong>40</strong> Hmmm. David Beckham is booked for retaliating to a wild challenge from Kirsten. We can all probably remember a similar event a couple of years ago.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> 1-1. In yellow cards that is, as Jeremies is booked for a foul on Ince.</p> <p><strong>42</strong> More good play from England. Wise makes a great tackle on Scholl, and Scholes picks up the ball. Scholes then plays a one-two with Beckham which covers half the length of the field, and results in a half-volley from Scholes which again forces Kahn into a good save. This is the sort of play that worried the Portuguese. </p> <p><strong>45</strong> Which means that the next notable event has to be a lucky escape for England. Two successive corners German corners find Seaman flapping, and Dietmar Hamann just misses the target after firing in off a rebound.</p> <p><strong>48</strong> Half-time. </p> <p><strong>45</strong> Germany re-start.

As in the first half however, the opportunities rarely come to anything.</p> <p><strong>49</strong> A scramble in the German box ends with a shooting opportunity for Michael Owen. But the ball stubbornly refuses to come down and the opportunity passes.</p> <p><strong>50</strong> Which is what Paul Ince should have done, rather than blazing the ball over Kahn's bar after being set up by David Beckham.</p> <p><strong>532 GOAL!

His header finds the far post, and England are up.</p> <p><strong>54</strong> England's goal is swiftly followed by Germany's best chance of the game. Jancker eludes the attentions of Campbell and gets to a Scholl cross first. He spins and shoots, but the ball - which could have gone anywhere - goes over.</p> <p><strong>58</strong> Germany are really going at England. Scholl comes even closer than Jancker with a shot inside the box that only just trundles wide of Seaman's far post. There weer six England defenders back inside the area too. A lucky break.</p> <p><strong>60</strong> England substitution - Gerrard for Owen. Unlike on Monday, Keegan is looking to close up shop.</p> <p><strong>62</strong> Beckham, who has been dropping deep to pick up the ball throughout the game, is now finding spaces into which he can deliver the ball. One such attempt finds Shearer who heads the ball across the box towards Scholes, playing further forward in the absence of Owen. A hasty clearance from Nowotny clears the danger.</p> <p><strong>63</strong> Gerrard makes his first contribution of the game, robbing Scholl of the ball in the area just as the German was about to strike. Germany win a corner</p> <p><strong>64</strong> Another let off for England. The corner is whipped in by Deisler and headed down by Kirsten. Seaman can only clear the ball into the path of Jancker who, falling backwards, somehow conspires to miss.</p> <p><strong>65</strong> A rare moement in footballing history as Phil Neville produces a Giggs-ian stepover and leaves Deisler for dead. The resulting cross is too long, but we'll pass over that.</p> <p><strong>68</strong> Another German corner causes a few hearts to flutter but a foul by Jacker curtails any real danger.</p> <p><strong>69</strong> Germany substitution: Rink for Kirsten.</p> <p><strong>71</strong> England substitution: Barmby for Scholes.<br> Germany substitution: Ballack for Deisler<br> Scholes appears to be limping as he comes off for Everton's Barmby. </p> <p><strong>73</strong> These last few minutes are going to be tense. Germany are piling forward, and England appear to lose possession before they even get it. Still though, Germany appear unable to get a real strike on goal (wood is being touched at the time of writing).</p> <p><strong>76</strong> Although England aren't seeing much of the ball, the arrival of Gerrard and, latterly, Barmby appears to have settled the midfield a little, allowing Wise and Beckham to come inside freely and giving England several options when breaking upfield.</p> <p><strong>77</strong> Germany substitution - Bode for Jeremies. Germany's best player leaves the field.</p> <p><strong>79</strong> Alan Shearer is felled in the German box and, clutching his hip, hobbles off-field.</p> <p><strong>80</strong> Shearer comes back on the field, with Germany enjoying ever greater possession. Still they fail to do anything constructive with it, but England cannot rely on the failings of the opposition.</p> <p><strong>82</strong> Marco Bode tries to scoop the ball over the English defence one-by-one, and almost succeeds. A fortunate toe poke from Martin Keown eventually brings an end to another worrying moment.</p> <p><strong>84</strong> A decent shooting opportunity for Paolo Rink, after Paul Ince sells himself with a sliding challenge. Sadly for the left-footed Rink, he shoots with his right foot and the ball goes well wide.</p> <p><strong>86</strong> A long spell of German possession ends in Barmby giving away a dangerous free kick. Scholl sends it into the danger zone and Seaman is forced to punch, quite weakly, to keep the ball off Jancker's head.</p> <p><strong>88</strong> Markus Babbel is booked for protesting after a flailing Alan Shearer wins a free-kick. The Liverpool-bound defender better get used to it.</p> <p><strong>89</strong> Beckham sets up Gerrard for a shot on the edge of the area which bobbles into the arms of Kahn.</p> <p><strong>91</strong> England supporters, who have been far the more vocal all night, sense victory. What better way to celebrate than a quick round of the Great Escape?</p> <p><strong>93</strong> It's over! England, despite never playing as well as they did against Portugal, have won three points in Euro 2000, taking them into second place in the group. And, oh yeah, they've beaten Germany in a competitive match for the first time since 1966. Come on.</p>",

A fortunate toe poke from Martin Keown eventually brings an end to another worrying moment. 84 A decent shooting opportunity for Paolo Rink, after Paul Ince sells himself with a sliding challenge. Sadly for the left-footed Rink, he shoots with his right foot and the ball goes well wide. 86 A long spell of German possession ends in Barmby giving away a dangerous free kick. Scholl sends it into the danger zone and Seaman is forced to punch, quite weakly, to keep the ball off Jancker's head. 88 Markus Babbel is booked for protesting after a flailing Alan Shearer wins a free-kick. The Liverpool-bound defender better get used to it. 89 Beckham sets up Gerrard for a shot on the edge of the area which bobbles into the arms of Kahn. 91 England supporters, who have been far the more vocal all night, sense victory. What better way to celebrate than a quick round of the Great Escape? 93 It's over! England, despite never playing as well as they did against Portugal, have won three points in Euro 2000, taking them into second place in the group. And, oh yeah, they've beaten Germany in a competitive match for the first time since 1966. Come on.",

      "body": "<p>It must be said that there are things that the English are good at - war and pop music - and then there's things that mainland Europeans are good at: smoking fags and sitting over a drink in shady squares, watching the world go by. On balance, if I had to choose, I'd be good at war and pop - but after a week in Corsica, I concede that there's quite a lot to be said for the other way of doing things, too. </p> <p>I didn't go abroad until I was 35, when I started going on long-haul holidays like a thing possessed. I did this because one of my jet-setting friends told me, spitefully I now realise, that, having seen the beaches of Antigua and the Maldives, I was officially spoiled for Europe, where the sea was grey and the beaches thick with used syringes. </p> <p>On a more erudite level, this passage from Kingsley Amis's I Like It Here, as the hero contemplates the horrors of a hot mainland Europe, always stuck in my mind: \"All that sun, which made you set out to be colourful and wonderful instead of keeping quiet and getting on with the job. All that geography and biology, which made you behave as if you had invented the country instead of just living in it... All that air of maturity, lack of nervousness and doubt, devotion to serious shouting argument or dedicated gaiety, naturalness which was always an actor's naturalness... All that staring - which in England would be the mindless inquisitiveness of those whose greyly uniform lives were nourished on mere sensation, but in the sunny South was a frank, free, healthy, open, uninhibited curiosity.\" </p> <p>But what can you do? When in Rome, eat spaghetti. And when in Corsica, you'd better get used PDQ to a whole wagonload of sun, geography, maturity and the rest of it. You also, in my case, have to get used to the fact that your jet-set friend was lying to you, and that the sea and sand of this island poised between France and Italy is of a standard that makes the Caribbean look positively murky. The weather's better, too; I went in May, and I came back moderately sunburned - it will be two degrees hotter than that in October, however. Whatever you do, avoid July and August, when it's full of Frenchies, too scalding hot to go out before 4pm and prices in hotels and restaurants double - mmm, lovely. </p> <p>Corsica is 100 miles from France and 50 miles from Italy, which sounds like something God would do on a particularly good hair day. Corsicans are like the French without the ponciness and the Italians without the corniness, and the climate is similarly sweet, though the months from November to April see the island become the wild, untamed place of the popular imagination.

Big, cool, shady squares under plane trees that are a hundred years old, and loads of tables without ashtrays because you might as well just drop your fag end in the sand on the ground.

The only place I've ever seen the alfresco thing work properly here, in fact, is in Torquay. </p> <p>Frankly, though you're not supposed to say it, I love Torquay, and to a great extent I approve of holiday destinations insofar as they resemble it. I liked Funchal, the capital of Madeira, for this reason, and also Harbour Island in the Bahamas. But the little town of L'Ile Rousse, where we stayed, scored highest of all on my Torquameter. </p> <p>Founded in 1760 by the Corsican nationalist leader Pascal Paoli, who worked ceaselessly to throw off the yoke of Jacques and Giovanni Foreigner, Paoli predicted that it would be \"the gallows on which we hang Calvi\" - Calvi still being in the mitts of the Genoese, whose blockade was suffocating the economy of the putative state. Due to the export of wine and olive oil, L'Ile Rousse became a successful port, but now, according to the excellent Rough Guide to Corsica, \"The main traffic consists of holidaymakers... That the only town intended to be a Corsican success story makes its living from tourism as a classic French-style resort adds an ironic twist to Paoli's dream.\" </p> <p>There's always some misery-bucket who has to spoil things for everyone else, have you noticed? The only twist I was interested in was floating in my Martini as I sat in the square outside the Caf\u00e9 des Platanes in the place Paoli, the central square of L'Ile Rousse, thinking that, to judge by the statue there, old Pascal had been quite fit in a depressed done-it-all Jeff Bridges sort of way. I suppose you could call Torquay a French-style resort, too, if you wanted to be rude, but importantly they're both like the Riviera as it must have been in the early 50s, before mass tourism discovered it - more Mr Ripley than Mr Whippy. </p> <p>Sitting in Place Paoli, you can sip a Suze or a peppermint Get 27 and eyeball the 18th-century French architecture, all balconies and shutters and just a little bit gone to seed and therefore perfect, and fancy yourself as a European something rotten. The Caf\u00e9 des Platanes has been there since 1928, serves more than 150 types of alcoholic and/or ice cream cocktails (Turbot Jet: chocolate and peppermint ice cream and Get 27; Barbe Noire: chocolate ice cream and whisky; Colonel: lemon sorbet and vodka) and you can bet your virtue that it isn't owned by some horrible corporation, as is invariably the case with every folksy little joint in Britain. </p> <p>From your vantage point, you can observe that even in the town centre there are no yellow lines, no parking restrictions and that Corsican cars, like Corsican dogs, appear to be allowed to do what they want, even parking on zebra crossings. Yet somehow everyone seems to rub along. </p> <p>Maybe this sweet- temperedness has something to do with the restaurants; they certainly put me in a good mood. No cheque had a space for service charge; carafes of the purest Corsican water came to the table unbidden; not one joint tried to charge us for the air that we breathed while on their premises, which so many English restaurateurs seem determined to. The ritziest dinner we had was at Le Grand Bleu in rue Napoleon, which cost Ffr320 (\u00a332) for two people with a gorgeous Corsican wine, Colombo, but there were also Ffr70 and Ffr90 set menus, as there are in most Corsican restaurants. At L'Etoile D'Or, in Place Paoli, I had a seafood salad with a champagne sauce that was unbelievable. I never thought I'd go at a salad like a piggy at its trough, but the lettuce had actual sex appeal. A testimony to the cool and ceaseless smoking of the Corsicans is the huge steel stand-up ashtray right beside the toilet here. </p> <p>Le Crillon, a hotel and restaurant two minutes away from the main tourist drag, on the avenue Paul Doumer, is the sort of place that, in the 50s, Cyril Connolly would drag his mistresses hundreds of miles to, in search of the perfect tomato salad. High ceilings, glazed windows, a condiments boat and Ray Charles on low, obviously not done up in any way and a lady who looked like Edith Piaf sitting alone at the next table eating fish soup with a\u00efoli; here, you can find heaven for Ffr78. The steak roquefort and potato gratin screamed out for a cigarette afterwards, and I'm not even a smoker. </p> <p> There's only a few bad things about Corsica, and even they aren't really that bad unless you're working overtime at being a worry-wart. There's not much to do, even in Calvi - you'd better be there with someone you like a heck of a lot. I'm afraid to say that the long afternoons between the glorious beach sessions and the gorgeous dinners did seem to call out for some form of lingering, languorous sexual activity, but as I was on holiday with my boyfriend's mother, romping wasn't really on the agenda, to say the least. Instead, I found myself walking half a mile each afternoon to pick up yesterday's Daily Mail, just for kicks. But Calvi is only 45 minutes on the train, through some of the loveliest scenery you'll ever see. </p> <p>Don't be expecting to pig out in five-star luxury in Corsica; our hotel, the Santa Maria, was clean and cool but had no suites, no restaurant and the television was entirely foreign except for an American financial channel. In the Caribbean, you get about 16 English channels, many of them devoted to films - but then the price you pay for this is holidaying among masses of North Americans, and, frankly, I don't think I can ever do this again, not at my age. The floor was of the sort of rough rustic matting, a bugger on the bare feet, that would have had Kingsley effing and blinding like a good 'un, but the bathroom was a pristine white temple to dear departed hi-tech. </p> <p>Whatever shortcomings the hotel had were more than made up for by the pool; one reasonably-sized cold rectangle on an attractive terrace. I've lost count now of the number of Caribbean resorts, some of them very upmarket, which fail to manage this, and now that the sea in so many places is rendered hazardous by wet-biking, it's not much to ask. But no; the pools in such places tend to be tiny, tepid, constructed in such a way that laps are an impossibility and, most annoying, surrounded by sticky-beaked signs instructing one \"not to swim unless the lifeguard is present\", though how you're supposed to drown yourself in a pool measuring four feet at the deep end, I don't know. Here, the deep end was deep - ie, you couldn't stand up in it - and if there ever had been a lifeguard, he'd gone off and got a life for himself long ago. </p> <p>As if all this gorgeousness wasn't enough, it only takes one hour 40 minutes to get there direct.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It must be said that there are things that the English are good at - war and pop music - and then there's things that mainland Europeans are good at: smoking fags and sitting over a drink in shady squares, watching the world go by. On balance, if I had to choose, I'd be good at war and pop - but after a week in Corsica, I concede that there's quite a lot to be said for the other way of doing things, too. I didn't go abroad until I was 35, when I started going on long-haul holidays like a thing possessed. I did this because one of my jet-setting friends told me, spitefully I now realise, that, having seen the beaches of Antigua and the Maldives, I was officially spoiled for Europe, where the sea was grey and the beaches thick with used syringes. On a more erudite level, this passage from Kingsley Amis's I Like It Here, as the hero contemplates the horrors of a hot mainland Europe, always stuck in my mind: \"All that sun, which made you set out to be colourful and wonderful instead of keeping quiet and getting on with the job. All that geography and biology, which made you behave as if you had invented the country instead of just living in it... All that air of maturity, lack of nervousness and doubt, devotion to serious shouting argument or dedicated gaiety, naturalness which was always an actor's naturalness... All that staring - which in England would be the mindless inquisitiveness of those whose greyly uniform lives were nourished on mere sensation, but in the sunny South was a frank, free, healthy, open, uninhibited curiosity.\" But what can you do? When in Rome, eat spaghetti. And when in Corsica, you'd better get used PDQ to a whole wagonload of sun, geography, maturity and the rest of it. You also, in my case, have to get used to the fact that your jet-set friend was lying to you, and that the sea and sand of this island poised between France and Italy is of a standard that makes the Caribbean look positively murky. The weather's better, too; I went in May, and I came back moderately sunburned - it will be two degrees hotter than that in October, however. Whatever you do, avoid July and August, when it's full of Frenchies, too scalding hot to go out before 4pm and prices in hotels and restaurants double - mmm, lovely. Corsica is 100 miles from France and 50 miles from Italy, which sounds like something God would do on a particularly good hair day. Corsicans are like the French without the ponciness and the Italians without the corniness, and the climate is similarly sweet, though the months from November to April see the island become the wild, untamed place of the popular imagination.

      "body": "<p><strong> Stage 1. Thursday. Dulwich - Dover. 129km</strong> </p> <p>Battling in a brutal headwind up the near-vertical hill that is the old approach road to Dover, it came to me that it might have be easier to reach Belgium by getting called up for the England team. Instead, I was going by bike, along with 57 others who had set off in a tidy peloton that morning from Dulwich College and were now strung out over the clifftops in varying degrees of bedragglement as the unseasonable gusts of early June tried to blow us back to London. </p> <p>I'd better explain. Bike to Brussels is one of two annual cycle trips organised as fund-raisers by the British Legion. For \u00a3350, you get overnight hotel accommodation, meals, outward ferry journey from Dover to Calais, and return fare on Eurostar.

This year, we also had the services of a piper, Duncan, whose plangent tones saw us off through the southern outskirts of London towards the Channel, the battlefields of the Somme and, three days and many litres of sweat later, the heart of Europe. </p> <p>As with childbirth, of course, one is programmed only to remember the wonderful bits, otherwise one would never reproduce again and the human race would die out. I had forgotten how awful it is to cycle through Kent in wind and rain, through never-ending roadworks, up hills that did not seem to go down again, on a bike that was designed more for the carting home of the weekend shopping than for challenging for kingship of the mountains. </p> <p>As ever, the organisers were keen to stress that this was not a race, though as we forced ourselves towards the waiting ferry a useful motivation for tired legs and sore knees was to entertain fantasies of being involved in some bitter pursuit match with Richard Virenque. </p> <p>My fellow pedallers were the usual mixed but delightful bunch. I shared vast platefuls of chips with lean young guys to whom Lycra was a second skin, and blathered about bikes with grizzled veterans in their sixties and seventies who could remember the prime of Reg Harris and who, despite their antique appearance, sped past me on the hills like Marco Pantani while I heaved and puffed on the granny gear.

The father, a distinguished-looking cross between Sir John Mills and Arnold Ridley, went missing soon after we left Dulwich. The police were alerted by his frantic son, who gave them a touchingly filial description of a gentleman on the verge of 70, adrift in the elements in nothing but shorts and a T-shirt saying Bike To Brussels.

      "bodyText": "Stage 1. Thursday. Dulwich - Dover. 129km Battling in a brutal headwind up the near-vertical hill that is the old approach road to Dover, it came to me that it might have be easier to reach Belgium by getting called up for the England team. Instead, I was going by bike, along with 57 others who had set off in a tidy peloton that morning from Dulwich College and were now strung out over the clifftops in varying degrees of bedragglement as the unseasonable gusts of early June tried to blow us back to London. I'd better explain. Bike to Brussels is one of two annual cycle trips organised as fund-raisers by the British Legion. For \u00a3350, you get overnight hotel accommodation, meals, outward ferry journey from Dover to Calais, and return fare on Eurostar. On top of this, you are asked to find sponsorship, but basically this is a cheap and exhilarating rattle through the back roads of northern France and Belgium on a bike. I had done the Legion's Pedal to Paris four years back, and retained fond memories of the wine-and-baguette-fuelled control stops in shady villages of the Somme, of the laughs and sense of freedom, not to mention the lasting friendships begun over the borrowing of a tube of Deep Heat.

Ray-Bans, an Armani suit and the latest mobile phone will easily deflect their wolfish gaze. \"Another local who's made it,\" they'll sniff. </p> <p>Mercs are in and Ladas definitely out in this laid-back capital. Since independence in 1991, it has turned its back on Moscow and St Petersburg to look squarely at a Western future. In the medieval core, bars and restaurants proliferate, serving young moneyed locals, tourists and Finns on booze cruises. You can be feeling your way along the half-lit corridor of a 13th-century Dominican monastery when you trip over a step and stumble into a busy modern bar. </p> <p>Winding cobbled streets and stone arches lead into restaurants or craft workshops. In summer, the daylight is almost unending and bathes the city in what can seem, at least at 3am, an almost supernatural glare. </p> <p>Facing north from Toompea Hill, the Hanseatic Lower Town inclines to the port, with its jumble of spires, fortified buildings and pastel merchant houses. Straight ahead, beyond the ferry terminal and Tallinn Bay, the Baltic meets the sky towards Helsinki, 85km away. </p> <p>\"The Russians came to liberate us in 1944, but forgot to leave,\" says Anna, our guide, who happens to be Russian. A familiar story in Tallinn's complex history. Waves of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian invaders have left a cocktail of architectural styles topped up since 1218, when the Danes built a stone castle on Toompea Hill. German merchants soon followed. The rail link to St Petersburg in 1870 brought a Russian influx. </p> <p>Today, 40% of Tallinn's population is Russian, and the government promotes a delicate integrationist policy. Street posters portray smiling Russian and Estonian citizens. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> The distinctive onion domes of the Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky cathedral dominate Toompea Hill. Finished in 1900, but modelled on 17th-century Muscovite architecture, it is provocatively named after a medieval conqueror of Estonia. Its icons, mosaics and 15-ton bell were imported from St Petersburg. </p> <p>There's hardly a Russian building in Tallinn that hasn't withstood a whispering campaign to have it demolished. But, say locals, \"it would take more explosives than we've got\", and the cathedral is safe for now. </p> <p>Up the hill, the Estonian art museum contains unfamiliar names in familiar European styles. Nearby, the terraces at Toom R\u00fc\u00fctli and Rahukohtu provide the best views across the city. </p> <p>Raekoja Plats, the town hall square, has seen festivals, markets, punishments and, in 1444, probably the world's first Christmas tree. Now it's full of restaurants and bars, just the place to loll over a glass of Saku beer. </p> <p>Vanaisa Juures on M\u00fc\u00fcrivahe sells a bewildering selection of liqueurs and vodkas. Try Vana Tallinn (\u00a34), or the pricier Kannu Kukk with its sugar crystals at the bottom of the bottle (\u00a38). Along the street under the city wall, women sell traditional woollen garments. </p> <p>The Gothic town hall is bestrode by Old Thomas, \"protector\" of Tallinn, a suitably tiny, ineffectual-looking figure. </p> <p><strong> Further afield</strong><br> </p> <p> Two miles east, around the bay, lie the song grounds, with a 1950s amphitheatre at the foot of a natural bowl. Singing festivals were held to celebrate occasions such as Stalin's birthday, but, in 1988, 300,000 gathered to sing for independence. The venue is still used for huge folk festivals and pop concerts. In winter, locals ski and sledge down the slope. </p> <p>The baroque palace in Kadriorg Park was commissioned by Peter the Great in 1718, and designed by the Italian Niccolo Michetti. The \"mini Versailles\" is the president's official residence, but from next month it will host the foreign art collection. </p> <p>The outlying \"bedroom districts\", so-called because there's nothing to do except sleep, demonstrate Soviet planning of striking banality. Three-, five-, and 13-storey blocks incongruously overlook rural-style smallholdings, and Trabants pass by hoardings advertising casinos. </p> <p><strong> Saaremaa and Muhu islands</strong><br> </p> <p> The \"old Estonia\" lies an hour-and-a-half's drive and a 30-minute ferry ride west of Tallinn. It too has seen multiple invasions - in 1227 the Teutonic Knights marched 20,000 soldiers across the Baltic ice. It was a spa resort from 1824 until the Soviets built rocket installations and banned foreigners. The hangars now lie empty in the forests. </p> <p>The population is sparse, even by Estonian standards, and wildlife includes boar and a vast number of birds. Traditionally, the islanders survived on fishing and sealhunting. Now tourists come for the windmills, mud spas and the sandy beaches on the fragmented coastline. There are some interesting restaurants, including one in a windmill (Veski at 19 Parna). </p> <p>The meteorite crater at Kaali is a source of huge pride to the locals. </p> <p>On Muhu, joined to Saaremaa by a causeway, the Koguva open-air village museum preserves reed-thatched cottages, a school house and an antique sauna (with birch branches for a post-sweat beating).</p> <p><strong> 5 of the best restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> It's easier to eat Italian than Estonian in Tallinn. International restaurants proliferate, and traditional recipes of herring, black or white pudding or pea soup with pigs' trotters are mostly confined to the home. Main courses cost from around \u00a34 in the cheaper establishments to \u00a312 in the upmarket hotel restaurants. </p> <p><strong> Olde Hansa </strong> Vana turg 1, tel: +6279 020.

On Muhu, joined to Saaremaa by a causeway, the Koguva open-air village museum preserves reed-thatched cottages, a school house and an antique sauna (with birch branches for a post-sweat beating). 5 of the best restaurants It's easier to eat Italian than Estonian in Tallinn. International restaurants proliferate, and traditional recipes of herring, black or white pudding or pea soup with pigs' trotters are mostly confined to the home. Main courses cost from around \u00a34 in the cheaper establishments to \u00a312 in the upmarket hotel restaurants. Olde Hansa Vana turg 1, tel: +6279 020. A recreated medieval banquet hall serving wild boar, and even bear. Vanaema J\u00fc\u00fcres (Grandma's) Rataskaevu 10/12, tel: +6313 928. Traditional Estonian dishes in a homely environment. M\u00f5\u00f5kkala R\u00fc\u00fctli 16/18, tel: +6313 583. Upmarket seafood restaurant in what, in medieval times, was the executioner's house. Exit Sauna 2, tel: +6442 031. Authentic, high-quality Caucasian food. Elevant Vene 5, tel: +6313 132 For a quirky take on Indian cuisine, with an eco-friendly dining room painted with egg, cheese and natural pigments and hung with bizarre animal portraits. 5 of the best bars Kloostri Ait Vene 14, tel: +6446 887 A large airy bar in a former medieval warehouse. A Bohemian crowd, rather than the more usual yuppies. Live music in the evenings, from jazz to Estonian folk. Kompressor Rataskaevu 3. Light, airy and industrial, with music videos on a large screen. Karja Kelder (Cattle Cellar) V\u00e4ike-Karja 1, in the old city, tel: +441 008. A traditional basement beer cellar. Nimega Baar (Bar With a Name) S\u00fc\u00fcr-Karja 13, in the old city; tel: +6209 299. Smart bar, often with live bands, run by a Scottish football fan who decided to stay on after a match in 1993. Roosa Klaver Jazz Bar (Pink Piano) Viru 8, tel: +6448 852. Terrible pink decor, but excellent live jazz. 7#149; Frequent ferries cross from Virtsu to Kuivastu on Muhu. Accommodation is available in hotels, farms and the beautiful 16th-century P\u00e4daste Manor (00 372 4548 800) currently under renovation on the coast at Muhu.

For the sake of England's pride let's hope they take Arnhem by storm. They kick off and knock it about - eventually Constantin Galca brings down Rui Costa. That's put a stop to that.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Nuno Gomes latches onto a Luis Figo through ball - he's onside but because he's so far ahead of the last man the flag goes up. A bad, bad decision. Portugal deserved a goal.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Figo feeds Gomes down the right - he cuts inside into a bit of space but drags his shot across the front of the goal. Romania aren't exactly rocking, but they're giving the Portuguese far too much space. Ring any bells?</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Carlos Secretario wins a corner for Portugal. Romania hack it away but the Portuguese just keep coming back. The ball is knocked around for a period until Figo wins another corner. The ball is worked into the box - another bad clearance falls to Rui Costa who sends a soft volley wide.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Dorinel Munteanu wins a corner for Romania. It comes to nothing but it's the first bit of pressure from the men in yellow.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Gheorghe Hagi swings a high free-kick into the Portuguese box - if Ilie was on his toes there could have been a chance to nick the ball over the advancing Vitor Baia, but the Porto keeper is allowed to claim easily.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> Christian Chivu lobs in a cross from the left, which Baia drops. Romania don't have a man on hand to take advantage, but that won't do the keeper's confidence any good.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> Good news for England. Hagi clatters into Joao Pinto and is booked - it's his second caution of the tournament and he won't face Keegan's men in Charleroi on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>22</strong> Dan Petrescu is totally diddled by Rui Costa on the edge of the box. You can't say the Chelsea man hasn't learnt from his time in England, though - he hacks the skilful midfielder down. Booked.</p> <p><strong>25</strong> Secretario flips Viorel Moldovan up into the air.

Subs: Lobont, Prunea, Ciobotariu, Mutu, Petre, Lupescu, Rosu, Belodedici, Ganea, Hildan, Lincar. Referee Gilles Veissiere (France) 1 min It's the time of truth - are Portugal really that good? For the sake of England's pride let's hope they take Arnhem by storm. They kick off and knock it about - eventually Constantin Galca brings down Rui Costa. That's put a stop to that. 2 Nuno Gomes latches onto a Luis Figo through ball - he's onside but because he's so far ahead of the last man the flag goes up. A bad, bad decision. Portugal deserved a goal. 5 Figo feeds Gomes down the right - he cuts inside into a bit of space but drags his shot across the front of the goal. Romania aren't exactly rocking, but they're giving the Portuguese far too much space. Ring any bells? 7 Carlos Secretario wins a corner for Portugal. Romania hack it away but the Portuguese just keep coming back. The ball is knocked around for a period until Figo wins another corner. The ball is worked into the box - another bad clearance falls to Rui Costa who sends a soft volley wide. 10 Dorinel Munteanu wins a corner for Romania. It comes to nothing but it's the first bit of pressure from the men in yellow. 12 Gheorghe Hagi swings a high free-kick into the Portuguese box - if Ilie was on his toes there could have been a chance to nick the ball over the advancing Vitor Baia, but the Porto keeper is allowed to claim easily. 15 Christian Chivu lobs in a cross from the left, which Baia drops. Romania don't have a man on hand to take advantage, but that won't do the keeper's confidence any good. 16 Good news for England. Hagi clatters into Joao Pinto and is booked - it's his second caution of the tournament and he won't face Keegan's men in Charleroi on Tuesday. 22 Dan Petrescu is totally diddled by Rui Costa on the edge of the box. You can't say the Chelsea man hasn't learnt from his time in England, though - he hacks the skilful midfielder down. Booked. 25 Secretario flips Viorel Moldovan up into the air. From the free-kick on the left, Ilie curls in a wonderful ball which is heading for the top-right corner of the net - it's tipped away brilliantly by Baia. 26 From the corner, the Portuguese keeper reverts to type. He drops the ball into a crowd of players and is fortunate to see the ball scrambled away by sharp red shirts and missed by extremely blunt yellow ones. 27 Cosmin Contra is booked for weakly dragging back Figo 30 who is in turn booked for softly knocking Moldovan over. My, my, the referee is conscientious. 35 This is turning into a dour midfield battle, albeit with some tricky little cameos. 40 This is now a dour midfield battle with no tricky little cameos. 42 Hagi tries one from nearly forty yards out on the right touchline. No, it didn't go in. 45 Into injury time in the first half. Mr Referee, blow your whistle please. 45 Thank you. HALF TIME: Portugal 0 - 0 Romania 46 The Romanians restart the game. 46 Popescu lifts a high ball towards the Portuguese goal.

      "body": "<p>When Henry Nicholls, a British-born doctor and agriculturalist, claimed to have \"discovered\" Dominica's Boiling Lake in 1875, he recounted his exploits in the Illustrated London News as if he had just returned from a major imperial expedition to the head of the Nile. The local newspaper made fun of him - for while he was the first person to write an account of his adventure, hunters and map-makers had, of course, long known about this boiling volcanic cauldron in the heart of Dominica's stupendous rainforest wilderness. </p> <p>Even so, those who these days make the trek to the Boiling Lake might sympathise just a jot with the old colonial's vanity. For to go there -and return - is to feel excitement and a hint of anxiety (before), exhaustion and amazement (during) and exhilaration and more exhaustion (after). So what is it that makes it the stuff of legends (with its own \"I survived\" site on the internet)? </p> <p>The world's second largest boiling lake (New Zealand has the largest), its surface churnings hint at an unstable, shuddering earth below. For Dominica, along with many of its eastern Caribbean neighbours, is volcanic. Such a geology gives the island rippling mountain ranges, deep fertile valleys dense with a dazzling greenness, and water galore - streaming from rivers that plunge down waterfalls or ripple contentedly like a Scottish trout stream. </p> <p>You can know the island backwards but never know it all. The green-blanketed interior invokes an African heartland rather than an island a good deal smaller than the Isle of Wight. Hidden within these forests are sulphur springs, patches of boiling mud, fumeroles, multi-coloured streams, crater lakes, underwater hot springs and, of course, the Boiling Lake itself, deep inside the Morne Trois Pitons National Park, now a Unesco world heritage site. </p> <p>There are ambitious plans for a great long-distance hiking trail - a tropical challenge to, say, the Pennine Way. But for now, the Boiling Lake is the island's ultimate trial of strength. The one route to the Lake starts from the ridge-top village of Laudat, embalmed in sweet cooling breezes. Leave behind until your return the hot and cold delights of Titou Gorge, a sort of base camp, with its own residents, the eccentric Dr Fix-It and Sulphur, the hiking cat. And set out into the rainforest glades that are the glory of Dominica - tree ferns glittering in sun or rain, the straight-as-an-arrow trunks of the gommier, and chataigners with giant buttresses. Through the green are glimpses of the gaudy yellow-red bracts of the heliconia plant. And yet this is only \"secondary\" forest - a mere 20 years old, born after Hurricane David blasted its way through the island in 1979 turning green to brown hours. </p> <p>But Dominica replenishes itself fast, back to a familiar tangled, green warm-wet blanket. As Hagan Dorivea, our conscientious guide, explained, the fertility of the soil, the rain, the heat means that Dominica is a place where \"one stop and you grow\". So no stopping for the first hour or so until a drink from the waters of the Breakfast River. And then toiling up and up again on to the narrow ridge of Morne Nicholls. Here, the forest gives way to tough, wind-battered vegetation where the cloud cover sweeps down without warning, obliterating a view that stretches back to Laudat and down to the sea and the little coastal capital, Roseau. Then the clouds dissolved and way in front of us, but beyond one more ridge or perhaps even two, was a glimpse not of the lake itself but of steam bursting from within its green-encircled crater. </p> <p>But before you reach the Lake, you must cross the macabre Valley of Desolation. After a punishingly-steep descent, we reached a flat, bleak basin, stripped of vegetation except for mosses and ferns and surrounded by brown scree. Yet the valley seemed alive: with a whooshing sound from clouds of sulphur that rise from fumeroles; streams come and go, rocks are the colour of stained-glass windows, bubbling waters emerge inky-black or dribble milk, or flow primrose-yellow from sulphur, or orange from iron. </p> <p>By then, there was a sense of urgency to push on to the Lake itself. Another hour perhaps and then, in a final burst of energy, we reached the cliffs that edge the crater and peered through the sulphurous steam that swirls off its surface. That day, sitting above the steaming crater, I could see that its muddy, milk-white waters were calm at the edges and boiling turbulently at its centre. \"Seething like a huge cauldron, so utterly unlike anything I had ever seen in nature,\" wrote a British visitor in 1900. </p> <p>Indeed, that is how it has seemed to me the three times that I have made it to the Lake. But not always: it can be pale-green and glassy; or grey and stormy, and despite its \"boiling\" reputation (people have been seriously burned by its waters and two at least killed by poisonous fumes), a friend of mine, amazingly, once swam in it - on a day when the water had been tepid, almost cold. </p> <p>But there there was little time for contemplation at the Lake before starting out on the return hike. This included an idyllic rest-stop, a bathe in a tiny, milky, wayside pool with its own warm waterfall. Then the ascents and descents, but by then the narrow green ridges were filled with afternoon sunlight and the peaks on either side rose up like a child's spiky drawing. And eventually (six to seven hours is an average time for the trek), we were back at Titou Gorge, greeted by teenagers having fun jumping into the calm waters of its mouth. Sulphur the cat was still waiting for company or food and there was the self-styled Dr Fix-It tending his vegetable garden. A local farmer locked in some impenetrable battle over land ownership, he is a man of many moods - sometimes angry, sometimes placid. Not unlike the Boiling Lake itself.</p> <p><strong>Other volcanic hot spots in the eastern Caribbean</strong></p> <p>This \"necklace\" of islands lies at the point of convergence of two tectonic plates. There are at least 17 live volcanoes - of which 10 are on Dominica - stretching from Saba, in the north, to Kick 'Em Jenny, the submerged volcano near Grenada, in the south. The first recorded volcanic event in the Caribbean occurred in St Kitts in 1692. </p> <p>Some of the most intriguing volcanoes in the eastern Caribbean include: </p> <p><strong> Martinique:</strong> The worst catastrophe in the Caribbean's volcano history was in May 1902, when Mont Pel\u00e9e erupted and some 40,000 people were killed in the coastal town of St Pierre, known as the Paris of the Antilles. The town has been rebuilt, although the ruins of the theatre remain. Visit the fascinating museum about the volcano, and hike to the summit of the now tranquil Pel\u00e9e itself. Information on Martinique from the French Tourist Office (0906 8244123). </p> <p><strong> Montserrat: </strong> Since July 1995, the Soufriere Hills volcano has been active for the first time in recorded history. Roughly two-thirds of the island remains in the \"exclusion zone\", although day-time visits can sometimes be made to the abandoned outskirts of the capital, Plymouth, for an awesome view (when the clouds lift) of the volcano dome and the route of the pyroclastic flows that poured into Plymouth in 1997. </p> <p>On the other side of the island, from a viewing point at Jack Boy Hill, look down to the abandoned airport where flows reached the southern edge of the runway. From there, you can also see the route down Mosquito Ghaut, where the lava killed 19 people in June 1997 after burying several communities. Visitors are welcome at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (telephone in advance). Montserrat Tourist Board: 020-7242 3131. </p> <p><strong> St Lucia:</strong> The famous Pitons, twin volcanic peaks, south of the village of Soufriere (named after the French word for sulphur) are the most dramatic examples of St Lucia's volcanic past. Nearby is a somewhat over-rated \"drive-in volcano\", where visitors admire steaming sulphur springs. St Lucia Tourist Board: 020-7431 3675. </p> <p><strong> St Vincent:</strong> The Soufriere volcano erupted twice in the 20th century - in 1902 when 1,500 people were killed and in 1979. Start the hike from the north-east corner of the island, at the Rabacca Dry River. It's about a two-hour hike to the 700ft deep crater, one mile across. The last part involves crunching over the bare upper slopes of rock and ash. Take a guide. No nearby accommodation - the nearest is in the capital, Kingstown. St Vincent and the Grenadines Tourist Board: 020-7937 6570. </p> <p><strong> Guadeloupe: </strong> In 1976, an increase in activity at the La Soufriere volcano on Basse Terre prompted a temporary evacuation of 70,000 people. Photographs and information about that mini-crisis can be seen at Maison du Volcan, on the flanks of the volcano. Then take the trail for a two-hour there-and-back hike to the summit. Best to go on a clear day. Scientific monitoring continues. Contact the French Tourist Office (0906 8244123).</p>",

From there, you can also see the route down Mosquito Ghaut, where the lava killed 19 people in June 1997 after burying several communities. Visitors are welcome at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (telephone in advance). Montserrat Tourist Board: 020-7242 3131. St Lucia: The famous Pitons, twin volcanic peaks, south of the village of Soufriere (named after the French word for sulphur) are the most dramatic examples of St Lucia's volcanic past. Nearby is a somewhat over-rated \"drive-in volcano\", where visitors admire steaming sulphur springs. St Lucia Tourist Board: 020-7431 3675. St Vincent: The Soufriere volcano erupted twice in the 20th century - in 1902 when 1,500 people were killed and in 1979. Start the hike from the north-east corner of the island, at the Rabacca Dry River. It's about a two-hour hike to the 700ft deep crater, one mile across. The last part involves crunching over the bare upper slopes of rock and ash. Take a guide. No nearby accommodation - the nearest is in the capital, Kingstown. St Vincent and the Grenadines Tourist Board: 020-7937 6570. Guadeloupe: In 1976, an increase in activity at the La Soufriere volcano on Basse Terre prompted a temporary evacuation of 70,000 people. Photographs and information about that mini-crisis can be seen at Maison du Volcan, on the flanks of the volcano. Then take the trail for a two-hour there-and-back hike to the summit. Best to go on a clear day. Scientific monitoring continues. Contact the French Tourist Office (0906 8244123).",

He spent the night there before turning back, and a well of holy water sprang up.</p> <p>The place is called Maam Ean, and Mike Harding's favourite walk takes him there up a mile-long path from the road through the Inagh valley. \"The whole area is imbued with a magical feel, and the water from the well tastes absolutely gorgeous,\" he says. \"There's also a wonderful statue of St Patrick, a modern statue that I like a lot. It makes him look almost like a warrior, leaning on his staff and looking out to the west, and there's a little sheep to the side of him.\"</p> <p>Harding - a musician, broadcaster, author and dedicated walker - then tackles the sterner part of the day: a 1,100ft scramble up the hillside, across the pale outcrops of quartzite that make these mountains look as if they're always covered with frost. This brings him to the 2,100ft summit of Binn Chaonaigh with its little lake and splendid views eastward into Glean Fada, a six-mile valley so isolated that people would once walk across the Maumturks by moonlight just to get a game of cards. </p> <p>Six or eight miles due north, you can see a mountain called Devilsmother on the map, but Harding was told by a local that the correct translation from the Irish \"Magairli an Deamhain\" is \"devil's testicles\". He checked it in the dictionary - \"but you couldn't very well put that on a map, could you?\"</p> <p>His route then goes north-eastwards along the ridge, staying above 2,000ft and moving from summit to summit with wide and exhilarating views.

      "bodyText": "Beneath the southern flank of the Maumturk Mountains in Connemara stands a tiny church that is said to mark the westernmost point of the journeys of St Patrick in the 5th century. He spent the night there before turning back, and a well of holy water sprang up. The place is called Maam Ean, and Mike Harding's favourite walk takes him there up a mile-long path from the road through the Inagh valley. \"The whole area is imbued with a magical feel, and the water from the well tastes absolutely gorgeous,\" he says. \"There's also a wonderful statue of St Patrick, a modern statue that I like a lot. It makes him look almost like a warrior, leaning on his staff and looking out to the west, and there's a little sheep to the side of him.\" Harding - a musician, broadcaster, author and dedicated walker - then tackles the sterner part of the day: a 1,100ft scramble up the hillside, across the pale outcrops of quartzite that make these mountains look as if they're always covered with frost. This brings him to the 2,100ft summit of Binn Chaonaigh with its little lake and splendid views eastward into Glean Fada, a six-mile valley so isolated that people would once walk across the Maumturks by moonlight just to get a game of cards. Six or eight miles due north, you can see a mountain called Devilsmother on the map, but Harding was told by a local that the correct translation from the Irish \"Magairli an Deamhain\" is \"devil's testicles\". He checked it in the dictionary - \"but you couldn't very well put that on a map, could you?\" His route then goes north-eastwards along the ridge, staying above 2,000ft and moving from summit to summit with wide and exhilarating views. To the west stand another cluster of glittering quartzite mountains, the Twelve Bens of Connemara, and beyond them the wild Atlantic.

And as for his batting \u00ad well, he would be a promising one if he could display an ounce of the nous that seems to come naturally when he has a ball in his hand.

Since that epic 146 not out at Durban, he has made only 110 in Tests for eight times out.

The Illustrated Times praised \"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\". </p> <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859), the great Victorian engineer who built the Great Western Railway and Bristol's Clifton suspension bridge before spending the last decade of his life on his doomed project, the Great Eastern, a gigantic ocean-going iron steamship. </p> <p><strong>Distinguishing features:</strong> Pictured in front of the giant chains of a braking mechanism used in the attempted launch of the Great Eastern from its dry dock at Millwall in 1857 - an event that attracted thousands of paying spectators, who witnessed these chains whip out of control and throw a worker over the crowd to his death - Brunel is a tower of strength. The massive chains, the stovepipe hat, the cigar - can the photographer really not have known what it all signified? The strap across Brunel's waistcoat belongs to the bag full of spare cigars he always carried. But if this is a study of rampant Victorian manhood, it is also about the birth of photography. </p> <p>The negative-positive photograph resulting in non-unique prints was invented by WH Fox Talbot in 1841. By the time this picture was taken, fantastic results were being achieved. Yet so many early photographs are airy-fairy fantasies, with everyone in the garden in fancy dress. The excitement in this picture is that of photography recognising itself. This photograph has no medieval disguises, no precedent in the history of art. It represents the self in a new way - it's as if through all Brunel's butch accessories the photograph is trying to give us a physical experience of the man. </p> <p>The National Portrait Gallery also owns a painting of Brunel from the same year. The painting, by John Callcott Horsley, is a conventional image of the designer at his desk, a represen tation of the intellectual that could have been painted any time since the mid-18th century. This photograph is from a different world. Brunel is not trammelled by tradition. He displays his power to us directly, as he displayed it to the men in the shipyard. </p> <p>It's a likable picture dirty boots and trousers, hands in pockets, barely contained energy. It looks as if Brunel has his eye on some clumsy subordinate. Yet the chains behind are bigger than he is they are his authority but threaten to overwhelm him. These monstrous chains are excessive, sublime. At his feet they vanish into darkness, as if they might be rattling down into hell or are links in an infernal machine. No wonder the Great Eastern was nicknamed Leviathan when it was demolished decades later it was said the skeletons of two labourers were discovered, sealed between its twin hulls. </p> <p>Brunel himself was never as confident as this again. Shortly after posing for this picture he tried to launch the ship, only to find it was stuck in its dry moorings. It took several more tries to get it waterborne. On the eve of the first sailing he had a stroke. The ship was plagued by problems and instead of the world's greatest passenger ship it became a cable-laying vessel. This tale of hubris was forgotten 50 years later in time for Cunard to build the Titanic. </p> <p><strong>Where is it?</strong> National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place, London WC2 (020-7306 0055)</p>",

The Illustrated Times praised \"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\". Subject: Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859), the great Victorian engineer who built the Great Western Railway and Bristol's Clifton suspension bridge before spending the last decade of his life on his doomed project, the Great Eastern, a gigantic ocean-going iron steamship. Distinguishing features: Pictured in front of the giant chains of a braking mechanism used in the attempted launch of the Great Eastern from its dry dock at Millwall in 1857 - an event that attracted thousands of paying spectators, who witnessed these chains whip out of control and throw a worker over the crowd to his death - Brunel is a tower of strength. The massive chains, the stovepipe hat, the cigar - can the photographer really not have known what it all signified? The strap across Brunel's waistcoat belongs to the bag full of spare cigars he always carried. But if this is a study of rampant Victorian manhood, it is also about the birth of photography. The negative-positive photograph resulting in non-unique prints was invented by WH Fox Talbot in 1841. By the time this picture was taken, fantastic results were being achieved. Yet so many early photographs are airy-fairy fantasies, with everyone in the garden in fancy dress. The excitement in this picture is that of photography recognising itself. This photograph has no medieval disguises, no precedent in the history of art. It represents the self in a new way - it's as if through all Brunel's butch accessories the photograph is trying to give us a physical experience of the man. The National Portrait Gallery also owns a painting of Brunel from the same year. The painting, by John Callcott Horsley, is a conventional image of the designer at his desk, a represen tation of the intellectual that could have been painted any time since the mid-18th century. This photograph is from a different world. Brunel is not trammelled by tradition. He displays his power to us directly, as he displayed it to the men in the shipyard. It's a likable picture dirty boots and trousers, hands in pockets, barely contained energy. It looks as if Brunel has his eye on some clumsy subordinate. Yet the chains behind are bigger than he is they are his authority but threaten to overwhelm him. These monstrous chains are excessive, sublime. At his feet they vanish into darkness, as if they might be rattling down into hell or are links in an infernal machine. No wonder the Great Eastern was nicknamed Leviathan when it was demolished decades later it was said the skeletons of two labourers were discovered, sealed between its twin hulls. Brunel himself was never as confident as this again. Shortly after posing for this picture he tried to launch the ship, only to find it was stuck in its dry moorings. It took several more tries to get it waterborne. On the eve of the first sailing he had a stroke. The ship was plagued by problems and instead of the world's greatest passenger ship it became a cable-laying vessel. This tale of hubris was forgotten 50 years later in time for Cunard to build the Titanic. Where is it? National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place, London WC2 (020-7306 0055)",

An insert fell out of my Daily Express today, a colourful shiny piece of A6 paper headed \"Celebrity Star Match!\" invited me to scratch off the panel on an illustration of a Mercedes convertible, to reveal a picture of a famous star. I did as instructed. Slowly, as a tiny pile of metallic grey dust collected, I began to see features of Cameron Diaz. </p> <p> Mrs Wormington was looking over my shoulder. \"Oos she when she's at 'ome?\" she said (the last time she went to the cinema was to see Rock Hudson. I pray she never finds out that Rock had to steel himself to kiss Doris Day, the truth could easily kill her.) I carried on reading the instructions: \"Now, one at a time, starting with panel one, scratch the four panels alongside.\" At this point, Glenn and William begged to be allowed to scratch two panels each. Glenn read further instructions aloud as William scratched. \"If you reveal a matching picture - stop scratching - you're a winner!\" Alas, his vigorous work with the two-pence piece revealed Tom Cruise and George Clooney. Mrs Wormington peered at these two megga heart-throbs and pronounced them \"Nancy boys\" who looked as if they \"couldn't stuff a lavender bag\". </p> <p> William pronounced himself to be \"devastated\" at his failure. I must stop him watching so much television, it is having a deleterious effect on his vocabulary. He has no sense of proportion. He fell off his tricycle yesterday. When I asked him if he was all right he said, \"I'm cool Dad, I just want to get on with the rest of my life.\" </p> <p> The tension grew as Glenn picked up the coin. He took a deep breath and scratched away. The features of Samuel L Jackson gradually took shape. Mrs Wormington confused him with Michael Jackson and seemed to be under the impression that M Jackson had actually married his pet chimpanzee, Bubbles. I tried to explain to her that the ape had, in fact, been the best man at Elizabeth Taylor's last wedding, but I could see that the ways of the modern world were beyond her comprehension. </p> <p> The atmosphere was now so tense that I could feel the word \"palpable\" vibrating in the air of the room. Glenn closed his eyes in silent prayer, then scratched at the fourth panel. Unbelievably, incredibly, the smiling face of Cameron Diaz appeared from among the grey filings. Our collective shout of delight brought Vince and Peggy Ludlow round from next door. \"I've won a Mercedes, Dad!\" shouted Glenn and we had a collective hug, though we didn't include Mrs Wormington, who has brittle bones. I read on feverishly. </p> <p> \"Winners can find out what they've won right now. Just call 0906 551 1020 and listen. Have a pen ready to write down your personal claims number which you will need if you claim a prize.\" </p> <p> I turned the leaflet over. Glenn hadn't necessarily won a convertible Mercedes, though for at least 10 deliriously happy seconds, he thought he had. He told me later that he had fantasised in that short time about driving to school in the silver car with the hood down and gangsta rap playing on the in-car stereo. He'd parked next to the headmaster's clapped-out VW and had walked across the playground with the car keys swinging from his index finger. I had to break the news to him that he may have won other, lesser prizes, including: a weekend in Cannes with \u00a3500, a dishwasher, a set of hardwood garden furniture, or, even lesser prizes such as key cases, razor sets, kitchen scissors and mixed seed packs. </p> <p> Peggy read further down the leaflet and pointed out that to discover what Glenn had actually won would cost me \u00a31 a minute, and that the average call lasted longer than 3.5 minutes. </p> <p> You see my dilemma, diary?

Indeed, mum tells him, when people die they all move to less fashionable parts of London, where they keep on doing pretty much what they were doing when they were alive. In a recent interview with Lynn Barber, Self acknowledged the autobiographical root of the story in the 1988 death of his own mother, an unhappy woman who was both \"very loving and very aggressive\". </p> <p>In How the Dead Live, Self has transformed one part of this premise into a full-length account of necropolitan London. In his satiric geography, the young dead - the \"morbidly mobile\" - go to find work in the States or the Gulf, but the older dead simply live on either north of the river in Dulston or south of the river in Dulburb, their placements assigned by the Deatheaucracy Office. Their mornings are busy with the Full Dead breakfast and their evenings filled with the 12-step meetings of PD (Personally Dead). Freddy Ayer, Ronny Laing and Laurence Olivier have Dulston flats; almost all the dead smoke, drink, and sleep around, and all they need to keep up with the urban deathstyle of the rich and famous is Goodbye! magazine. </p> <p>But for all its one-liners and Jewish-mother jokes, the novel is much darker and weirder than a Woody Allen movie. The other half of the story is the epic of the monstrous mother who haunts her children. This time Self's narrator is Mom - Lily Bloom, an angry, kvetching 65-year-old Jewish-American woman living in London, who dies of breast cancer in May 1988 in the Royal Ear Hospital (don't ask) but immediately finds herself naked on Gower Street with an Aboriginal wizard as her Death Guide and a Cypriot minicab driver ferrying her to her grubby basement flat in Dulston. Never a joiner, Lily has to put up with boring PD meetings and worry invisibly for 11 long years over the fate of her two grown daughters, matronly Charlotte and heroin addict Natasha. </p> <p>Lily is also saddled with the materialised spirits of two other dead children: Lithy, the fossilised cadaver of an unborn foetus, and Rude Boy, the bratty ghost of her nine-year-old son, who was killed in a car accident. They are noisy, taunting images of her failure as a mother. But Lily is not really dealing with karma or learning what death has to teach her; she spends her posthumous years in a series of annoying deatheaucratic waiting rooms replaying memories of her sexual escapades, unfaithful husbands and ungrateful children. Impatient, restless and controlling even in death, she wants only to be reborn in her children's lives. When the officials finally grant her wish to return in 2000 as her daughter's daughter, the result is futile and macabre. </p> <p>There is a lot for the reader to sort out in this ambitious but often confusing narrative. The time scheme is so convoluted that even the publisher's press release gets it wrong. And is it all meant to be a dream? Self drops some clues that he intends the vision of London as a city of the dead to be Lily's narcotised deathbed hallucination, a projection of her experiences, memories and inner demons.</p> <p>Scenes in the hospital such as, for example, Lily's observation of a little boy playing with his toys, recur in Dulston; Phar Lap Dixon, Lily's Aborigine guide, is a figure Natasha encountered on a trip to the outback. But the narrative of the afterlife is also so fully developed and detailed that it seems to be Self's surreal, sci-fi dystopia of urban alienation, global catastrophe, death and recycling. The subplot of Natasha's addiction, recovery and relapse repeats a central theme of Self's fiction and journalism, here starkly deglamorised. </p> <p>Self is a manic, inventive stylist who can't leave anything out: literary allusions from Goodnight, Moon to Finnegans Wake; discussions of Australian sympathetic magic; a sub-theme about Lily's dentures (dentures also made a cameo appearance in \"The North London Book of the Dead\"). What with Martin Amis and Zadie Smith, this has certainly been a vintage literary year for teeth, and maybe Self has bitten off more plot than he can chew. </p> <p>Nonetheless, what How the Dead Live lacks in economy of structure it repays in lavishness of feeling and characterisation. Lily is a colossal heroine, a nighttown Molly Bloom who memorably reveals herself through her furious monologue. What begins as a satiric novel of ideas ends as a surprisingly moving elegy.</p>",

Along with Walt Whitman, he is also one of the most firmly American: the writer as home-boy, westerner, talisman; a natural, iconic, untainted innocent in the most popular or populist sense. Much of this easy-going status comes from his particular location in 19th-century American culture. Out of Virginia and Tennessee, the Clemens family, like many others, moved west toward the shifting frontier along the Mississippi Valley - which, in the Jeffersonian space between the Louisiana Purchase, opened up the territories, bringing a new idea of America and the national crisis of the Civil War.</p> <p>These were the new American heartlands, taken away from the Native Americans, grasped from the French and Spanish; and they opened out into the great national artery that gave the States a new axis from north to south. The region took on all the characteristics of American spread and pioneering entrepreneurialism: small sudden settlements, wagon trains, country stores, tin churches, lawyers' offices, print shops, medicine men, property boom and bust, bad investments, sharecropping and, of course, slavery.</p> <p>But they were also in the process of becoming mythic territory to the East Coast and the European imagination, embodying all the American notions of frontier independence: solitude, pioneering, new territories, fresh lands and fresh opportunities. The day-to-day truths were much grimmer, more complex and corrupt. \"Sivilisation\" fought with decline, law and lawlessness, and disease was rife. The age of the frontier gave way to growth and expansion, territories became states and the great rivers became war zones. When it was over, the post-bellum world found a new unity in industrialism, entrepreneurship, fast capitalism: it was the age of the locomotive, the telephone and the lightbulb.</p> <p>Samuel Clemens/Mark Twain - steamboat pilot, silver explorer, newspaper journalist, western humorist gone east - was there to tap into the great transition. And, above all, what he tapped was its voice: the humorous vernacular, the storytelling drawl, the distinctive pace and the unusual narrative speed, the different way of describing things that cast light, shade and emphasis afresh, the innocent-eyed tactic that enabled him to win fame not, at first, by writing about the great river or his Hannibal boyhood, but about a pious trip by American tourists trying to make sense of the cultural sites of Europe.</p> <p>It was the voice and note that made him a typically American and yet at the same time a world writer, quite as famous internationally as Dickens had been a generation earlier. He was intimately and cleverly aware of his own tactics. One of the famous essays collected in Cannibalism in the Cars - a pleasant collection of, chiefly, earlier humorous pieces in a good cheap-price format called Prion Humour Classics - is \"How to Tell a Story\". Here, with great clarity, Twain defines the tactical difference between the European comic writer and his distinctive American counterpart, the humorist: \"The art of telling a humorous story - understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print - was created in America and has remained at home.\"</p> <p>Twain, of course, was more than a humorist, and revising, deconstructing and remonumentalising him are now classic American academic industries. We all know now that there were two Twains: affirmer and dissenter, white-suited comedian and cosmic pessimist, innocent-eyed writer and explorer of deep darkness, cultural conservative and radical.

      "bodyText": "Dangerous Water: A Biography of the Boy who Became Mark Twain Ron Powers Perseus, \u00a316.50, 328pp Buy it at BOL Cannibalism in the Cars: The Best of Mark Twain's Humorous Sketches Mark Twain Prion Books, \u00a38.99, 241pp, Buy it at BOL Mark Twain isn't just one of the greatest of American writers - the one from whom, according to Hemingway, all American fiction is reckoned to begin. Along with Walt Whitman, he is also one of the most firmly American: the writer as home-boy, westerner, talisman; a natural, iconic, untainted innocent in the most popular or populist sense. Much of this easy-going status comes from his particular location in 19th-century American culture. Out of Virginia and Tennessee, the Clemens family, like many others, moved west toward the shifting frontier along the Mississippi Valley - which, in the Jeffersonian space between the Louisiana Purchase, opened up the territories, bringing a new idea of America and the national crisis of the Civil War. These were the new American heartlands, taken away from the Native Americans, grasped from the French and Spanish; and they opened out into the great national artery that gave the States a new axis from north to south. The region took on all the characteristics of American spread and pioneering entrepreneurialism: small sudden settlements, wagon trains, country stores, tin churches, lawyers' offices, print shops, medicine men, property boom and bust, bad investments, sharecropping and, of course, slavery. But they were also in the process of becoming mythic territory to the East Coast and the European imagination, embodying all the American notions of frontier independence: solitude, pioneering, new territories, fresh lands and fresh opportunities. The day-to-day truths were much grimmer, more complex and corrupt. \"Sivilisation\" fought with decline, law and lawlessness, and disease was rife. The age of the frontier gave way to growth and expansion, territories became states and the great rivers became war zones. When it was over, the post-bellum world found a new unity in industrialism, entrepreneurship, fast capitalism: it was the age of the locomotive, the telephone and the lightbulb. Samuel Clemens/Mark Twain - steamboat pilot, silver explorer, newspaper journalist, western humorist gone east - was there to tap into the great transition. And, above all, what he tapped was its voice: the humorous vernacular, the storytelling drawl, the distinctive pace and the unusual narrative speed, the different way of describing things that cast light, shade and emphasis afresh, the innocent-eyed tactic that enabled him to win fame not, at first, by writing about the great river or his Hannibal boyhood, but about a pious trip by American tourists trying to make sense of the cultural sites of Europe. It was the voice and note that made him a typically American and yet at the same time a world writer, quite as famous internationally as Dickens had been a generation earlier. He was intimately and cleverly aware of his own tactics. One of the famous essays collected in Cannibalism in the Cars - a pleasant collection of, chiefly, earlier humorous pieces in a good cheap-price format called Prion Humour Classics - is \"How to Tell a Story\". Here, with great clarity, Twain defines the tactical difference between the European comic writer and his distinctive American counterpart, the humorist: \"The art of telling a humorous story - understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print - was created in America and has remained at home.\" Twain, of course, was more than a humorist, and revising, deconstructing and remonumentalising him are now classic American academic industries. We all know now that there were two Twains: affirmer and dissenter, white-suited comedian and cosmic pessimist, innocent-eyed writer and explorer of deep darkness, cultural conservative and radical. And we know the huge spread of his work; the recent publication of a multi-volume Oxford Mark Twain, with strong new introductions, has reminded us that he was one of the world's most productive as well as multi-purpose writers. Yet there is profit, and even truth, in the idea of innocence, especially as Twain understood and exploited it. He knew the worth of casting a glow over a world that, as Ron Powers reminds us in his \"childhood biography\", Dangerous Water, contained some of the more disturbing and critical materials of American culture. \"In Mark Twain's dark night lay America's literary dawning,\" Powers suggests, reminding us that much of the humour in Twain's work did come from strangeness and darkness. Visitors who today go to Hannibal, Missouri, the riverbank town of Samuel Clemens's boyhood, will find it tacky, the imagery crude; its landscape has been remapped to match the fiction, while the best sights to hand, apart from the raging river itself, are some fine Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the region. But, late settled as a river staging post for the steamboats on which Clemens worked, it was indeed the birthplace of and sourcebook for his writing. This was because, as Powers rightly says, Hannibal became, for Twain and the American people, a concept of \"the past, a concept he had largely created and placed in his boyhood books for preservation\". A novelist who was himself born in Hannibal, Powers usefully and vividly explores not just the childhood life in its light, and more often in its darkness, but the process by which Twain exploited, distanced, reworked and refined his childhood material for publication. The versions varied at different stages of his life, though the sheer tenacity of certain memories and the completeness of Twain's lifelong dependence on them is striking.

      "bodyText": "The bitter row over the repeal of section 28 which has dogged Labour in Scotland looked finally to be over yesterday when it emerged that ministers had accepted a compromise proposal stressing the importance of marriage. After months of increasingly unpleasant wrangling, the education minister, Sam Galbraith, said he was prepared to accept a report which called for the legally binding guidance issued to local authorities on sex education to contain reference to the responsibilities and importance of marriage. Mr Galbraith had previously refused to accept any changes in the guidance and opposition parties yesterday accused him of a humiliating climbdown. The controversy over repeal of the clause, which bans the promotion of the acceptability of homosexuality, has been furious in Scotland. The Labour dominated Scottish executive - and the prime minister - have been taken aback by the strength of feeling it has provoked. An anti-repeal campaign run by the millionaire businessman Brian Souter - which included a much-criticised independent referendum - has been backed by most of the Scottish tabloids. Ministers in Westminster and Holyrood felt it was over shadowing many of the executive's achievements. A committee set up to look at repeal, which included representatives of the main churches, called on the executive to insert a clause in its guidance which stressed \"the importance of family life and relationships including the responsibilities of parenthood and marriage\". Mr Galbraith said yesterday he was prepared to take that recommendation on board. \"There are no hierarchical relationships, no value judgments, what they do talk about is the responsibilities of parenthood and marriage and, as a married parent myself, I fully appreciate these,\" he said. Gay rights campaigners also said they were happy with the new wording. Tim Hopkins, of the Equality Network, said: \"If marriage is placed above other relationships that would have been discriminatory, but it is not and we have no problem with the guidance.\" Mr Souter's Keep the Clause campaigners yesterday refused to comment on the developments, but the indications are that they are prepared to accept the compromise. Nicola Sturgeon, the shadow education minister, said Mr Galbraith had performed a u-turn, but she hoped the compromise would finally settle the debate.

But open one she has, so here goes... </p> <p>It would take a genius of design and a stockpot full of money to transform this section of the Carrow Road complex into anything other than the corporate dining suite of a middle-ranking first division football club writ large. </p> <p>Sensibly, the proprietor has chosen to leave it as close to the experience as possible: blown-up black-and-white photographs of heroes past and present cover the walls, football motifs liven up the window blinds, and the baggy trousers of the waiters and waitresses, elasticated at the top, have the same black-and-white colours as a ball, albeit arranged in irregular shapes, which, as my daughter observed, looked like cow pats on snow rather than anything to do with the great game.

Ups included sound peppers, velvety, mild smoked salmon, fine foaming hollandaise, and succulent, fat-free duck confit with a properly sour cherry compte. Downs included soggy blinis, tough pork, coarse jerk seasoning that tasted as if it came from a bottle, starchy fresh peas, fallen chocolate souffl\u00e9 that has fallen so far as to become a too, too solid wodge, and a meringue of death-embracing sweetness. </p> <p>The question that restaurant goers have to ask themselves is: do they want to pay restaurant prices - our bill came to \u00a389.50, which included a fine bottle of Cypress Shiraz from Oz at \u00a317.50, mineral water and some lemonade - for food that you could reasonably expect to produce in your own home?

      "body": "<p>Different strains of plants under the same name umbrella can present many problems and disappointments. It is sad to have to recommend suspicion and caution in respect of every acquisition, but that is my message. </p> <p> Hydrangea villosa is one of the most delectable of its genus: soft, furry leaves; intense, lilac florets in a ring around a central disc of tiny blue flowers; bees besieging it for pollen. You buy a plant and find, after a few years, that it is nothing like as good as the one you fell for, with wan-coloured flowers, maybe, and coarser foliage. Then, belatedly, you look it up in the RHS Plant Finder and find yourself referred to H. aspera Villosa Group. What do they mean by \"Group\"? Evidently, that there is no fixed and finally defined clone on which you can rely. Quite right; there isn't. Word of mouth and advice from an expert is (or would have been) the safest recourse. </p> <p>When there is a reliable cultivar name, seize upon it; if there are several, take advice and buy the best clone. As with Liquidambar styraciflua , for instance. This makes a tall, though fairly narrow, tree with maple-like leaves, but it is chiefly noted for its autumn colouring. Grown from seed, which is the easiest way to raise it, you may get a liquidambar that never colours at all. So you must acquire a named cultivar that has been selected for its fall colour and is propagated vegetatively. There are more than two dozen listed in the Plant Finder, but two of them, 'Lane Roberts' and 'Worplesdon', have the Award of Garden Merit insignia. Buy one of them. </p> <p> Vitis coignetiae is a vigorous vine that is grown entirely for its large, handsome foliage. That has (or should have) a prolonged crimson colouring season in autumn, but is often a disappointment. The season itself may be the reason, as weather conditions in some years do not promote fall colour, but if a failure to colour up well is monotonously frequent, you are growing a bad clone. There are named clones, such as 'Claret Cloak', but you can more easily buy a good one by visiting a selling centre in autumn and picking out a well-coloured specimen yourself. Some of its high colouring may be attributable to the roots being pot-bound, but at least you can be certain that your plant is capable of putting on a good show if the circumstances are right. I would choose a Virginia creeper, such as Parthenocissus henryana or P. quinquefolia, in the same way. </p> <p>There are many disappointing forms of the shrubby Euphorbia characias, too. They seed themselves, and from their look before flowering you cannot tell that the colour will be a quite uninteresting green. Subspecies wulfenii is the one to choose, for size of inflorescence, but it can vary in colouring, from muted green to eye-catching yellow with only a hint of green. Buy your plant on the hoof, so to speak: if you can see that it is of a lively colouring, you don't need to worry whether it has a cultivar name or none. </p> <p>Bulbs that hail from warmer climates may not receive sufficient sun-ripening in Britain to enable them to put on a good show. But there will be some strains within the same species that are far more willing flowerers than others. I have in mind Sternbergia lutea, which has brilliant chrome-yellow, crocus-like flowers in autumn. A poor clone may not flower at all, which was the case with my original purchase. Then a friend gave me a few bulbs from his garden (on chalk), where they perform magnificently. It pays to cultivate the right friends. Similar experiences may occur with certain Tulipa species, such as T. sylvestris and T. saxatilis, with the autumn-flowering Crocus kotschyanus (also listed as C. zonatus) and the bright-pink, autumn-flowering Amaryllis belladonna. In such cases, you should, of course, help all you can by providing the hottest position possible. </p> <p>Hardiness is another trap. Many eucalyptus, say, are on the borderlines of hardiness in our climate, but if their seed was wild-collected from an area where winters are cold - rather than from a lower elevation where winters are milder - the same species is more likely to be a success with us. Some seed collectors are well aware of this problem, and advertise the seed they are purveying accordingly (and will do much the same with their seedling plants). </p> <p>Turning now to vegetables: new strains are developed on research stations that are, in many respects, such as productivity (though possibly not flavour), superior to those already established on the market. You should, therefore, not be too loyal to a familiar brand name, such as the old and famous 'Onward' pea strain, which has long been superseded in every respect. It still sells, however, because the name is familiar and many gardeners are reluctant to change, if they can avoid it. But the brand itself is likely to deteriorate. Having left its original trial grounds and been distributed to the trade, small effort is made, in the course of seed production over the years, to retain the original high standard. The seed crop will fail to be rogued for inferior plants, and so there will be a slippage. As a result, this may be a case where \"new\" really does mean superior, and is not just an advertiser's ploy. It is the same story with flower seed strains: delphinium Pacific hybrids, for one, are quite pathetic nowadays, compared with the originals bred by Vetterle and Reinelt.</p>",

A tiny Scottish fishing village has found itself split over plans to film yet another TV series on its only street. In the majority camp lie those desperate to see a share of the \u00a325m that is splashed into Scotland by deep-pocketed production companies each year, and in the other lie those who are fed up having to dodge boom microphones and coach loads of tourists on the way to the pub each weekend evening. On the surface, at least, it is the familiar fable of the lure of Mammon versus the desire to protect a fragile rural lifestyle; and, in an irony hardly lost on the villagers, it is a big-screen depiction of this very tale that caused all the problems in the first place. Before Burt Lancaster and his entourage flew in to film Local Hero, a movie about a Texan oil magnate trying to buy over a small village, Pennan was just another pretty fishing village in the north east of Scotland. But the worldwide exposure given to the white-washed cottages and red phone box still brings thousands of tourists each year to its remote setting. Although the volume of sightseers has dwindled over the past 18 years - they tend now to come in national clusters dictated by where the film is being revived - their number was replenished last year when the BBC filmed its All Along the Watchtower series there. The corporation had wanted to exploit Pennan's charms once more in its new 2000 Acres on Skye drama, starring former EastEnder Michelle Collins. The village laird, Julia Watt, however, was having none of it. As the villagers set about organising a public meeting to discuss the production company's proposals, Mrs Watt contacted the owners of all 37 homes. She said there was an overwhelming majority against more filming in Pennan, though she refuses to make the exact result public. Brenda Kutchinsky, owner of the Pennan Inn and leader of the pro-faction, was not impressed with Mrs Watt's poll, so she organised a meeting in the village hall - it ended with a motion, passed 50-9, calling for the filming to go ahead. Rather than resolve the question it has instead led to battle lines drawn. Mrs Watt, who was not at the meeting, has refused to accept its result. Her husband bought the archaic feudal rights to Pennan in 1948 and, as feudal superior, she can make life very difficult for Zenith, the production company. With both sides deadlocked, Ms Kutchinsky called in Alex Salmond, the local MP. Mr Salmond suggested a referendum. \"I think that's the only way to prevent ill-feeling from forming,\" he said. But resentment is already beginning to stain. \"The production company said they would bring \u00a33.5m over three years, we can't turn that down,\" said Ms Kutchinsky. \"But it's not just about money. There are only 18 year-round residents in Pennan. \"The place is dying. If people see how beautiful it is on the telly, they may think they want to give up the rat race and come here.

Not because they're particularly awesome in their own right, but because so few people seem to be aware of them. And because they're rarely examined side by side. </p> <p><strong> Fact number one.</strong><br> A level grade for A level grade, you stand less chance of getting a first or a 2.1 at Oxford or Cambridge than at many other UK universities. In other words, an Oxbridge education doesn't add as much 'value' as a degree from a shiny new university or solid redbrick. Lucky old Laura Spence, then. Just as well she didn't get in. </p> <p><strong> Fact number two.</strong><br> Degree result for degree result, you still stand a better chance of getting a certain class of job if you went to Oxbridge. We're not talking fast-stream Civil Service here - or even top-five accountancy firm. The former is now bound by political correctness and the latter by a numbers game. No, the recruiters who remain faithful to Oxbridge are the representatives on earth of big-bucks careers without necessarily a conscience or a quota: investment banking; the London Bar; management consultancy; top City solicitors. It's not so much that these opportunities are denied to you if you got your 2.1 from a redbrick, simply that your chances of getting the jobs are diminished by comparison with someone who 'just missed a first' from Oxbridge. And if you went to an ex-poly - why expose yourself to all that rejection? </p> <p>Putting one and two together what do we conclude? Perhaps no one told those god-like graduate recruiters about fact number one. Or maybe they know something we mere mortals don't. Isn't it just possible that Oxbridge adds a different kind of value. And one that Laura Spence's much-maligned interviewer may have put his finger on when he dared to utter the \"C\" word. Could the apparent gap between the two facts be filled by 'confidence'? </p> <p>Let's give the still-smouldering Laura Spence story a little sequel. Assume for the sake of argument that she did get into Oxford after all, arriving next October with high hopes, her auntie's biggest suitcase and a new toaster. In the porter's lodge, she unwittingly smiles at her new tutorial partner. </p> <p>He's pushing a little trolley laden with a battered trunk, several sleek pot plants and a large number of alien electrical appliances. His stout leather shoes make a curious clicking noise that somehow reassures the new girl. It reminds her of the sound of stilettos on a Saturday night, outside the clubs back home. </p> <p>As the first year wears on, though, his presence reassures her less and less. The ex-public schoolboy seems to do little work and yet breezes through their weekly sessions with the don. He asks questions designed to flaunt his knowledge, nods earnestly in the right places, makes eye contact. The comprehensive kid, on the other, spends more and more time in her room, puzzling over why she can't achieve the successes of the past. </p> <p>In tutorials, she mumbles into her A4 offerings and dares not ask questions about the things she doesn't understand, for fear of looking stupid. As summer finally comes, she succumbs to the vicious spiral of sinking confidence and thinks of giving up. Her tutor suggests that maybe she wasn't suited to university after all. </p> <p>Of course, this isn't how it would have turned out for Laura. But it's exactly what happened to me - longer ago than I care to remember and still painful after all these years. The story has a happy ending, well, at least a happy middle. I managed to start again in the same college with a different subject and rode the confidence roller-coaster with relative success over the next few years. </p> <p>Perhaps I'd just learnt how to play the game. Or, maybe, I restarted my degree in a class of students whose confidence levels were even lower than mine. Whatever. You don't ask questions when you're a high-grade junkie. </p> <p>I wasn't confident enough to apply to an investment bank though, let alone blag my way through the interview. (In truth, I'd never even heard of investment banks until my public school-educated colleagues started getting jobs with them.) </p> <p>And now, 13 years on I look around at the people I'm still in touch with and what do I see? Those who went to state schools are academics, teachers, scientists, trade journalists, maybe accountants if they're lucky. Those educated in the independent sector have generally reached much loftier heights in terms of salary and status. But is my small sample representative? Is it even surprising? </p> <p>This time around, I'm brave enough to call the careers service for the answer to my careers question. If 53% of Oxford places are offered to state-school pupils, does that mean they also get 53% of the top-paying milkround offers? The patient careers adviser explains that they don't collect that data. They know roughly where people go, but they don't know where they come from in the first place. He does suggest, however, that 'career success' has more to do with personality type than social background. </p> <p>I agree with him up to a point (that was always my problem with careers advisers). I can't help feeling that the personality trait in question is confidence, but that it does depend very much - if not on social background - on education. The more you have when you arrive at Oxbridge, the more you accumulate. The more you accumulate, the better you'll do at interview, no matter how humble or how exalted the graduate job in question (and to some extent regardless of your ability to do the job). </p> <p>The only problem is that students from state schools often arrive at Oxbridge with a low confidence quotient. As one friend puts it: \"You don't speak up in comprehensive for fear of getting punched in the face after class.\" Your confidence can tumble yet further at Oxbridge, resulting in a poorer degree than you deserve and a not-so-happy graduate recruitment ending. </p> <p>And graduate recruitment is really just the beginning. In ten years' time you could find yourself PA to your old tutorial partner. Take it from me, it'll be too late then to say \"Please mister, can I have my balls back?\" Learn the confidence trick, while you've still got a chance. </p>",

      "body": "<p>A CV, no matter how good, will not get you a job by itself. However, a good CV will attract the attention of the recruiter and, at the very least, secure you an interview. The purpose of a CV is to reveal your accomplishments and qualifications to a potential employer. And of they like what they see, they'll soon be in touch for a face-to face-meeting. </p> <p>Think of your CV as a promotional brochure about you. You need to show a potential employer what you have achieved so far and where your knowlegde, skills and any relevant experience lies. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to emphasise the skills and attributes that a particular employer is looking for. </p> <p>But your CV is also a written example of your communication and organisational skills. A well done CV is a marker of what kind of valuable employee you would be. Likewise, a sloppily-produced CV is the best way to remove yourself from the running before the race even starts. </p> <p>There's no shortage of books and websites on CVs and CV writing - some of them contradictory, but most of them useful. A fiver on a good CV book will be money very well spent if it teaches you the fundamentals of CV writing. </p> <p>But try to stay in touch with current thinking in CVs too as CV advice follows trends. The web is home to plenty of free advice and information - much of it is written in the Unitied States, but can be a useful predictor of CV fashion. </p> <p>With so many different occupations, professions and sectors open to graduates, there isn't a single CV template that works for everyone. There are, however, generally accepted ways to arrange the information on your CV to present it in the best light. </p> <p>The two styles that you'll come across most often are the 'chronological format' and the 'functional format'. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to presenting your information. A third style, the 'combination', is a compromise between the two and has become more popular in recent years. </p> <p><strong>1. Chronological </strong></p> <p>This is the most common CV style because it's the one that most employers prefer. In the chronological format, the emphasis is placed on education and employment experience. The applicant's school, university and job history is presented in reverse chronological order, with the most recent placed at the top of the list. </p> <p>The chronological CV is good if your recent qualifications and experience are relevant to the job. Potential employers can easily see what you have done, and how you have progressed and garnered relevant skills and knowledge. </p> <p>Despite its popularity, there are some reasons why the chronological format may not be right for you. If you are just entering the workforce from university and have little track record of part-time or summer working, a CV like this may actually highlight your lack of experience. Alternatively, you may have held summer jobs recently that have no relevance to the position you're applying for. If you are re-entering the workforce after a couple of years bumming around, this kind of CV can also highlight your recent inactivity. Any large gaps in your 'learning' history will be evident, and you may be asked about them. </p> <p><strong> 2. Functional </strong></p> <p> In this non-linear format, your skills and achievements are emphasised. Your employment history is summarized or avoided all together. Your skills and previous relevant experience (including educational experience) are presented at the beginning of your CV. They are organised so the employer can see how your skills relate to the job position you are applying for. (In a chronological CV, employers may simply be looking at any jobs you have held previously to see if you have the experience they are looking for.) It may take more effort to write a functional CV, but you are free to highlight your talents instead of your recent job experience. </p> <p>The functional CV can be particularly effective if your education and working experiences have been in a similar vein; it will allow you to highlight your skills rather than itemise what might look like a one-dimension history. </p> <p>But the functional CV may also raise concerns in some employers' minds as to whether you are withholding information. This doesn't mean that functional CVs are ignored or that they can't be effective. But an employer looking for a clear history may be put off by the functional format, especially if you've used it to hide your inexperience or a long period of 'time out'. </p> <p>If you don't have any problems with the reverse chronological format, use it instead. If you still like the idea of the functional format, you may want to make it more acceptable by combining it with the chronological format and creating a combination CV. </p> <p><strong> 3. Combination </strong></p> <p>The combination CV is simply a functional CV with a brief employment history added. Skills and accomplishments are still listed first; the employment history follows. You need to reveal where you worked, when you worked, and what your job position was. This will allay an employer's worries about your experience, and it still allows you to emphasise your talents and how you would use them for the job you are applying for. While most employers might still prefer a chronological CV, this is a good alternative to the functional CV. </p> <p>Whatever style you choose, keep it concise. Employers have lots to do, so don't make the mistake of asking them to read through an unnecessarily long CV. A long, wordy CV will put off someone who is already short on time. CVs should be one page, if possible, and two if absolutely necessary to describe relevant work experience. </p> <p>A two page CV is no advantage if it's full of information that isn't reasonably applicable to the position you're applying for. Use the space only if you need it to fully describe your accomplishments. </p> <p>Make every word count. Your use of language is extremely important and ensure the CV addresses your potential employer's needs. </p> <p><strong>Email your way to the top jobs on the internet</strong></p> <p>An electronic CV is simply your CV in a format that can be sent via email or the internet. The advantage to having an electronic CV is simple - you can respond instantly to job openings posted all over the world. No need for faxing or queuing at the post office. </p> <p>If your CV is on a PC hard disk, floppy or CD, you already have it in electronic format; but that's not to say it's in the most useful format. While it's true that most email systems can accommodate document attachments - be they in Word, WordPerfect, Quark or otherwise - it won't be true that every person or organisation to whom you'd like to send your CV is willing or able to receive it in that format. Plain text (also called ASCII text or MS-DOS text and recognised by its three letter file extension '.txt'), however, is universally accessible and, in many cases, required. </p> <p>To make your electronic CV as readable as possible, follow these simple steps: </p> <p>\u0095 Using a standard word processing application, compose a CV as you would normally. Note that plain text format is very basic - it won't recognise fancy formatting such as bullets, bold facing or italicised text. So consider using asterisks (*), plus symbols (+) and capital letters to achieve similar effects. In any case, make sure your CV is legible in the absence of these formatting features. <br> \u0095 If the word processing application permits, set your margins at 0 and 65 characters. This means that your longest line, including spaces, exceeds 65 characters before wrapping to a new line. This will make your CV easier to read and, just as importantly, safe to print. <br> \u0095 Using the 'Save' command (or, if you're converting a document from another format, the 'Save as...' command), save your document as an ASCII or MS-DOS text document. Remember to add the .txt extension on to the file name, for example 'CV.txt' </p> <p>When sending an electronic CV, remember to: </p> <p>\u0095 Include a covering letter, remembering to mention where you found the advertisement. <br> \u0095 Send the CV and covering letter in one file. You can do this by writing or pasting your covering letter in the space before your CV. You can also send your covering letter as an email message with your electronic CV as a file attachment. <br> \u0095 Use the job title and/or job reference number as the subject of your message. Cite any relevant job numbers noted in the ad. <br> \u0095 Follow up with an email or phone call a week or so after you submit it. </p> <p>Even if you are submitting your CV in hard copy form, bear in mind that it might be processed by electronic scanning equipment. More employers are using scanning software to sift through large volumes of applications. </p> <p>Tips for writing a scannable CV include: </p> <p>\u0095 Using simple fonts, such as Helvetica at point sizes of between 10 and 14. <br> \u0095 Avoiding italics, script, and underlining. <br> \u0095 Using bold face type sparingly. <br> \u0095 Finding an ink jet or laser printer for optimal printing quality. <br> \u0095 Avoiding abbreviations. <br> \u0095 Always using white paper. <br> \u0095 Never folding your CV in order to send it. Use an A4 envelope instead.</p>",

Think of your CV as a promotional brochure about you. You need to show a potential employer what you have achieved so far and where your knowlegde, skills and any relevant experience lies. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to emphasise the skills and attributes that a particular employer is looking for. But your CV is also a written example of your communication and organisational skills. A well done CV is a marker of what kind of valuable employee you would be. Likewise, a sloppily-produced CV is the best way to remove yourself from the running before the race even starts. There's no shortage of books and websites on CVs and CV writing - some of them contradictory, but most of them useful. A fiver on a good CV book will be money very well spent if it teaches you the fundamentals of CV writing. But try to stay in touch with current thinking in CVs too as CV advice follows trends. The web is home to plenty of free advice and information - much of it is written in the Unitied States, but can be a useful predictor of CV fashion. With so many different occupations, professions and sectors open to graduates, there isn't a single CV template that works for everyone. There are, however, generally accepted ways to arrange the information on your CV to present it in the best light. The two styles that you'll come across most often are the 'chronological format' and the 'functional format'. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to presenting your information. A third style, the 'combination', is a compromise between the two and has become more popular in recent years. 1. Chronological This is the most common CV style because it's the one that most employers prefer. In the chronological format, the emphasis is placed on education and employment experience. The applicant's school, university and job history is presented in reverse chronological order, with the most recent placed at the top of the list. The chronological CV is good if your recent qualifications and experience are relevant to the job. Potential employers can easily see what you have done, and how you have progressed and garnered relevant skills and knowledge. Despite its popularity, there are some reasons why the chronological format may not be right for you. If you are just entering the workforce from university and have little track record of part-time or summer working, a CV like this may actually highlight your lack of experience. Alternatively, you may have held summer jobs recently that have no relevance to the position you're applying for. If you are re-entering the workforce after a couple of years bumming around, this kind of CV can also highlight your recent inactivity. Any large gaps in your 'learning' history will be evident, and you may be asked about them. 2. Functional In this non-linear format, your skills and achievements are emphasised. Your employment history is summarized or avoided all together. Your skills and previous relevant experience (including educational experience) are presented at the beginning of your CV. They are organised so the employer can see how your skills relate to the job position you are applying for. (In a chronological CV, employers may simply be looking at any jobs you have held previously to see if you have the experience they are looking for.) It may take more effort to write a functional CV, but you are free to highlight your talents instead of your recent job experience. The functional CV can be particularly effective if your education and working experiences have been in a similar vein; it will allow you to highlight your skills rather than itemise what might look like a one-dimension history. But the functional CV may also raise concerns in some employers' minds as to whether you are withholding information. This doesn't mean that functional CVs are ignored or that they can't be effective. But an employer looking for a clear history may be put off by the functional format, especially if you've used it to hide your inexperience or a long period of 'time out'. If you don't have any problems with the reverse chronological format, use it instead. If you still like the idea of the functional format, you may want to make it more acceptable by combining it with the chronological format and creating a combination CV. 3. Combination The combination CV is simply a functional CV with a brief employment history added. Skills and accomplishments are still listed first; the employment history follows. You need to reveal where you worked, when you worked, and what your job position was. This will allay an employer's worries about your experience, and it still allows you to emphasise your talents and how you would use them for the job you are applying for. While most employers might still prefer a chronological CV, this is a good alternative to the functional CV. Whatever style you choose, keep it concise. Employers have lots to do, so don't make the mistake of asking them to read through an unnecessarily long CV. A long, wordy CV will put off someone who is already short on time. CVs should be one page, if possible, and two if absolutely necessary to describe relevant work experience. A two page CV is no advantage if it's full of information that isn't reasonably applicable to the position you're applying for. Use the space only if you need it to fully describe your accomplishments. Make every word count. Your use of language is extremely important and ensure the CV addresses your potential employer's needs. Email your way to the top jobs on the internet An electronic CV is simply your CV in a format that can be sent via email or the internet. The advantage to having an electronic CV is simple - you can respond instantly to job openings posted all over the world. No need for faxing or queuing at the post office. If your CV is on a PC hard disk, floppy or CD, you already have it in electronic format; but that's not to say it's in the most useful format. While it's true that most email systems can accommodate document attachments - be they in Word, WordPerfect, Quark or otherwise - it won't be true that every person or organisation to whom you'd like to send your CV is willing or able to receive it in that format. Plain text (also called ASCII text or MS-DOS text and recognised by its three letter file extension '.txt'), however, is universally accessible and, in many cases, required. To make your electronic CV as readable as possible, follow these simple steps: \u0095 Using a standard word processing application, compose a CV as you would normally. Note that plain text format is very basic - it won't recognise fancy formatting such as bullets, bold facing or italicised text. So consider using asterisks (*), plus symbols (+) and capital letters to achieve similar effects. In any case, make sure your CV is legible in the absence of these formatting features. \u0095 If the word processing application permits, set your margins at 0 and 65 characters. This means that your longest line, including spaces, exceeds 65 characters before wrapping to a new line. This will make your CV easier to read and, just as importantly, safe to print. \u0095 Using the 'Save' command (or, if you're converting a document from another format, the 'Save as...' command), save your document as an ASCII or MS-DOS text document. Remember to add the .txt extension on to the file name, for example 'CV.txt' When sending an electronic CV, remember to: \u0095 Include a covering letter, remembering to mention where you found the advertisement. \u0095 Send the CV and covering letter in one file. You can do this by writing or pasting your covering letter in the space before your CV. You can also send your covering letter as an email message with your electronic CV as a file attachment. \u0095 Use the job title and/or job reference number as the subject of your message. Cite any relevant job numbers noted in the ad. \u0095 Follow up with an email or phone call a week or so after you submit it. Even if you are submitting your CV in hard copy form, bear in mind that it might be processed by electronic scanning equipment. More employers are using scanning software to sift through large volumes of applications. Tips for writing a scannable CV include: \u0095 Using simple fonts, such as Helvetica at point sizes of between 10 and 14. \u0095 Avoiding italics, script, and underlining. \u0095 Using bold face type sparingly. \u0095 Finding an ink jet or laser printer for optimal printing quality. \u0095 Avoiding abbreviations. \u0095 Always using white paper. \u0095 Never folding your CV in order to send it. Use an A4 envelope instead.",

Last time you felt like this, your mum was waving you goodbye from the school gates. Don't panic. Here is (just about) everything you need to know to get you through your first day at work. </p> <p> <strong> Your first day will be miserable </strong><br> You'll stick out like a sore thumb. You'll be the only person wearing a brand new suit with the price tag still hanging from the back. Nobody will show you where the loos are. And when you try to find the loos, you'll walk in on the managing director's most important annual meeting. </p> <p>Nobody will teach you how to use office computer systems or tell you where the photocopy paper is kept. You'll be screamed at for crashing the central server. </p> <p>The paper you find will jam the photocopier. You'll be escorted round the office and introduced to at least 500 people. You'll instantly forget the names of all five hundred people ... but, without exception, they'll remember yours. </p> <p>You'll either be thrown in at the deep end, which will be terrifying, or you'll have absolutely nothing to do (in which case, you'll have to go through it all again tomorrow). </p> <p> <strong> People will treat you like a grown-up</strong> </p> <p> One day you're a 'juvenile' student, taking exams, drinking pints and snogging in the union bar - the next you're a certified \"adult\" employee. </p> <p>It's a curious phenomenon, but if you wear a suit and carry a business card people will take you seriously. Your company's clients will want to shake your hand, take you to expensive restaurants and offer to buy you fine wines in plush wine bars. </p> <p>Suddenly, you'll understand what your gran meant when she said: \"I'm 85, you know, but I don't feel a day over 18\". Only 15-year olds actually want to be grown-ups. </p> <p>Accept it - it won't get any better (you'll just get older). Humour people who mistakenly treat you like an adult by smiling sweetly, acting responsibly and referring to share reports in the Financial Times. Then go home, play air guitar, eat pot noodles and trash your living room. </p> <p> <strong> Your boss will be schizophrenic</strong> </p> <p> You thought your boss really liked you. After all, he/she sent you nice letters saying: \"I'm delighted to offer you the job\" and told you you'd be an asset to their company. Heck, they wanted to work with you so much they even offered you money! </p> <p>So why, after just a few days, has the person who championed you turned into a morose, petty taskmaster with about as much tact as Liam Gallagher? He/she is human, that's why. \"We're all on our best behaviour in interviews,\" says the Edinburgh-based chartered psychologist Ben Williams. \"But even bosses have bad moods and off days. None of us is perfect. You've got to learn to make allowances.\" </p> <p>If your boss really is Liam Gallagher, check into the Priory at once. </p> <p> <strong> You're a nobody</strong> </p> <p> So, you've got three A levels. So, you've got a first class degree. That don't impress me much. Qualifications are just a means to an end. Anyone who told you otherwise was lying. The only way to become somebody at work is to prove you're a brilliant team-player and a hard worker. Never blow your own trumpet (or anyone else's, unless you're at the office Christmas party). </p> <p> <strong> You won't have any friends</strong> </p> <p> Then again, you won't have enemies either. Don't worry, there's plenty of time to acquire both ... and you will. </p> <p> <strong> Working with those who resent you</strong> </p> <p> In some industries, graduate trainees are about as popular as an outbreak of legionnaires' disease. \"People who've climbed the career ladder are suspicious of graduates,\" says Williams. \"As far as they're concerned, you're a fast tracker with no experience who has skipped the queue.\" Don't try to argue. </p> <p> <strong> ... and you'll have to get on with them</strong> </p> <p> \"You're a small minnow in a large ocean and the world doesn't revolve around you,\" says Williams. \"Remember your manners at all times and demonstrate a concern for other people, not just the managing director. This includes the office receptionist, the people wearing dirty overalls and the tea lady. Never, ever be snobbish.\" </p> <p> <strong> You'll have to set your goals</strong> </p> <p> Until now, your life has been a series of goals, with exams - GCSEs, A levels and finals - the goal posts. Unless you're entering a career which requires professional qualifications (like accountancy), your days of revising, popping pro-plus and wrist-strain are over. Hooray. </p> <p>The only problem is, if you want to progress and develop you'll have to set out your own aims and objectives (just getting through each day doesn't count). </p> <p> <strong> No long summmer vacations</strong> </p> <p> July to October will never be the same again. If you don't like it, become a teacher. </p> <p> <strong> You're bound to fail</strong> </p> <p> It's the hardest lesson of all for high achievers. \"Learn from your failures,\" says Williams. \"Your career won't be all smooth-sailing, but that's how you develop.\" </p> <p> <strong> There's no escape</strong> </p> <p> Face it, a real job isn't like a holiday job. There are only two ways to leave - get another job or get the sack. You might feel like you're trapped in an episode of The Prisoner , but that's working life. Make the most of it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just graduated? Time to take off that cap and gown and slip into something a little less comfortable... a new graduate job. Last time you felt like this, your mum was waving you goodbye from the school gates. Don't panic. Here is (just about) everything you need to know to get you through your first day at work. Your first day will be miserable You'll stick out like a sore thumb. You'll be the only person wearing a brand new suit with the price tag still hanging from the back. Nobody will show you where the loos are. And when you try to find the loos, you'll walk in on the managing director's most important annual meeting. Nobody will teach you how to use office computer systems or tell you where the photocopy paper is kept. You'll be screamed at for crashing the central server. The paper you find will jam the photocopier. You'll be escorted round the office and introduced to at least 500 people. You'll instantly forget the names of all five hundred people ... but, without exception, they'll remember yours. You'll either be thrown in at the deep end, which will be terrifying, or you'll have absolutely nothing to do (in which case, you'll have to go through it all again tomorrow). People will treat you like a grown-up One day you're a 'juvenile' student, taking exams, drinking pints and snogging in the union bar - the next you're a certified \"adult\" employee. It's a curious phenomenon, but if you wear a suit and carry a business card people will take you seriously. Your company's clients will want to shake your hand, take you to expensive restaurants and offer to buy you fine wines in plush wine bars. Suddenly, you'll understand what your gran meant when she said: \"I'm 85, you know, but I don't feel a day over 18\". Only 15-year olds actually want to be grown-ups. Accept it - it won't get any better (you'll just get older). Humour people who mistakenly treat you like an adult by smiling sweetly, acting responsibly and referring to share reports in the Financial Times. Then go home, play air guitar, eat pot noodles and trash your living room. Your boss will be schizophrenic You thought your boss really liked you. After all, he/she sent you nice letters saying: \"I'm delighted to offer you the job\" and told you you'd be an asset to their company. Heck, they wanted to work with you so much they even offered you money! So why, after just a few days, has the person who championed you turned into a morose, petty taskmaster with about as much tact as Liam Gallagher? He/she is human, that's why. \"We're all on our best behaviour in interviews,\" says the Edinburgh-based chartered psychologist Ben Williams. \"But even bosses have bad moods and off days. None of us is perfect. You've got to learn to make allowances.\" If your boss really is Liam Gallagher, check into the Priory at once. You're a nobody So, you've got three A levels. So, you've got a first class degree. That don't impress me much. Qualifications are just a means to an end. Anyone who told you otherwise was lying. The only way to become somebody at work is to prove you're a brilliant team-player and a hard worker. Never blow your own trumpet (or anyone else's, unless you're at the office Christmas party). You won't have any friends Then again, you won't have enemies either. Don't worry, there's plenty of time to acquire both ... and you will. Working with those who resent you In some industries, graduate trainees are about as popular as an outbreak of legionnaires' disease. \"People who've climbed the career ladder are suspicious of graduates,\" says Williams. \"As far as they're concerned, you're a fast tracker with no experience who has skipped the queue.\" Don't try to argue. ... and you'll have to get on with them \"You're a small minnow in a large ocean and the world doesn't revolve around you,\" says Williams. \"Remember your manners at all times and demonstrate a concern for other people, not just the managing director. This includes the office receptionist, the people wearing dirty overalls and the tea lady. Never, ever be snobbish.\" You'll have to set your goals Until now, your life has been a series of goals, with exams - GCSEs, A levels and finals - the goal posts. Unless you're entering a career which requires professional qualifications (like accountancy), your days of revising, popping pro-plus and wrist-strain are over. Hooray. The only problem is, if you want to progress and develop you'll have to set out your own aims and objectives (just getting through each day doesn't count). No long summmer vacations July to October will never be the same again. If you don't like it, become a teacher. You're bound to fail It's the hardest lesson of all for high achievers. \"Learn from your failures,\" says Williams. \"Your career won't be all smooth-sailing, but that's how you develop.\" There's no escape Face it, a real job isn't like a holiday job. There are only two ways to leave - get another job or get the sack. You might feel like you're trapped in an episode of The Prisoner , but that's working life. Make the most of it.",

Most people reserved their sympathy for the wronged husband, Dr Petter Lindstrom, who has died aged 93. </p> <p>The affair even reached Capitol Hill. There, on March 14 1950, Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado delivered a vitriolic diatribe to the United States senate, denouncing Bergman for \"an assault upon the institution of marriage\". He considered her to be \"one of the most powerful women on earth today - I regret to say, a powerful influence for evil\". </p> <p>In the moral climate of the time, to bear a child out of wedlock was unacceptable, though none of the fuss might have occurred if Lindstrom had granted Bergman a divorce when she asked for it. As for deserting her husband for another man, as Bergman herself reflected, divorces and remarriages in the film community were an everyday occurrence. </p> <p>Why, then, was she forced to pay such a heavy price? Because, for the American public, the Swedish actress - who had recently played a nun in The Bells Of St Mary's and the heroine in Saint Joan - represented integrity, moral decency and family values, and they could not forgive her for betraying their faith in her perfection. </p> <p>Bergman had met Lindstrom in Stockholm in 1933, shortly after her 18th birthday, when a cousin persuaded her to make up a foursome for a night out. The son of flower farmers, he was a handsome, hardworking dentist, and, to a naive girl like Bergman, the epitome of worldly sophistication. He was 25, and had dental and medical degrees from Heidelberg and Leipzig universities. He owned a car, was a fine sportsman and an excellent dancer, and had a good sense of humour. Highly intelligent, he was a model of old-fashioned moral virtues. </p> <p>Three years later, after Bergman had created a stir in her sixth film, Intermezzo, the couple got married. In 1939, their daughter Pia was born, and Intermezzo was shown in New York. When producer David Selznick offered Bergman a Hollywood contract, Lindstrom encouraged her to go, he and Pia following a few months later. </p> <p>Having settled in Beverly Hills, both Lindstrom's and Bergman's careers advanced. He moved from dentistry to lecturing in medicine, eventually becoming a renowned brain surgeon; she won her first Oscar, for Gaslight (1944). But Bergman was not happy. </p> <p>For all Lindstrom's virtues, his dominating attitudes curtailed her sense of freedom. He was critical of her, and made her look and feel foolish and inhibited. He was also puritanically frugal, restricting her ability to enjoy the luxuries they could now afford. She suggested divorce, but he refused - and they settled back into a solid, but, for Bergman, emotionally unsatisfying existence. </p> <p>One evening in 1948, the couple went to see Rossellini's neo-realist masterpiece, Rome: Open City. Bergman was shattered by it. After seeing his Paisa a few months later, she became obsessed with a desire to make a film with Rossellini. She even wrote him a fan letter. \"I am ready,\" she said, \"to come and make a film with you.\" </p> <p>In 1948, when Bergman and Lindstrom met the Italian director in Paris for the first time, Rossellini suggested she should appear in Stromboli. Her husband was sceptical, but Bergman was carried away with the idea. Rossellini went to stay with the Lindstroms in Los Angeles for further discussions on the film, and it was after the shooting of Stromboli was completed that Bergman told Lindstrom she would not be returning. </p> <p>There began a tormented and protracted correspondence between them, with Bergman begging for a divorce and contact with her daughter, and Lindstrom refusing both. In February 1950, a week after the birth of Robertino, her child with Rossellini, she obtained a Mexican divorce by proxy. Jean Renoir, a friend of both Bergman and Lindstrom, tried to help them and Pia through the emotional difficulties. </p> <p>\"It makes me so happy to hear that Petter is often with you,\" Bergman wrote to Renoir. \"Take care of him. Maybe you, Jean, whose life, I'm sure, has been difficult, confusing and tossed like a shipwreck, maybe you can explain to Petter that sometimes people leave and they don't go back. The trouble is I don't feel sinful. I'm unhappy so that it almost breaks my heart for what Pia must go through, and also Petter, though he could have helped and finished this thing earlier.\" </p> <p> It was not until 1957 that Bergman was reunited with Pia, by then 18, in Rome - and even that meeting was against Lindstrom's wishes. He remained bitter towards Bergman, and told her biographer, Laurence Leamer, that he regretted not telling the world years earlier of an Ingrid Bergman they did not know - a hard-drinking, heavy-smoking, promiscuous woman, who, according to Lindstrom, ignored her children and lived only to act. </p> <p>Lindstrom taught medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Utah, and later practised in San Francisco and San Diego. In 1954, he married Dr Agnes Ronavec, who survives him, as does Pia, the four children of his second marriage, Karl, Peter, Michael and Brita, and eight grandchildren. </p> <p>He was, recalled Brita, a wonderful man.

      "bodyText": "Winnie the Pooh, the Bear of Very Little Brain, created 80 years ago by AA Milne, has triumphantly crashed a new cultural barrier, being translated for the first time into Yiddish. The stories, usually more appreciated by parents than children, have already been translated into 31 languages - including Latin - and have survived a makeover by Walt Disney. But the honey-loving bear's charms have hitherto left Orthodox Jews cold. That may now change with his emergence as Vini Der Pu, given to a shout of \" Oy Gevalt! \" on discovering a new supply of krakh - honey - up a tree or chatting with his friends Kristofer Robin, and with Khazerl (Piglet), Kangus (Kanga), Iyas (Eeyore) and Kinigl (Rabbit). Even EH Shepard's illustrations have had a transformation. The famous map of Pooh's locality now has the hundert-akordiker Vald and the pu-pastke far hefalumpn instead of the wood where owl lives and the hefalump trap. The translation, by a New York academic, Leonard Wolf, is faithful but has certain discreet modifications. Pooh's song Cottleston Pie, for instance, has become Varshever, varshever, varshever tort which roughly translated means Warsaw cake. More striking still are the poems: Do kumen mir hant in hant/Kristofer Robin un ikh Zog, az s'iz dir a khidesh? ( Here we come, hand in hand, Christopher Robin and me tell me what's happening?) Martin Kaye of the British distributors Kuperard, based in Finchley, north London - which will be marketing the books in the next few weeks - said: \"I guess people who would speak Yiddish are not the sort who would be interested in Winnie the Pooh normally but maybe it's the sort of thing you might give Yiddish-speaking parents or aunts and uncles for a joke.\"",

Defying easy categorisation, it seemed to veer between spare realism and surreal allegory; at times, there were even overtones of her science-fiction writing. It concerned a couple who seek to construct an impregnable edifice of happiness based on having lots and lots of children. Their extended family disapproves of them, detecting in their manic procreation a form of narcissism and recklessness for which others, and by extension society, must pay. </p> <p>When their fifth child, Ben, is born, the couple are duly punished. He is, almost literally, a monster whose freakishness is characterised by random acts of violence and an utter inability to communicate. He is sent away, but when his guilty mother rescues him from incarceration in a grim, laboratory-style institution, the family is all but destroyed. Ben's unclassifiable otherness, his parents eventually decide, is down to a mad slip in the genes: he is a throwback, a troll, a goblin - even, at one point, an alien child. </p> <p> The Fifth Child ended inconclusively, with a half-hearted gesture towards Ben's unknowable future in an uncaring world.

Thus begins Ben's career as a globetrotter, his haphazard travels taking him from the south of France to Brazil, where an American filmmaker seeks to turn Ben's weird appearance and behaviour to his own advantage. </p> <p>That, roughly, is the plot, an aimless and uninvolving business that cares little whether it convinces or interests. The prose style is similarly careless; often repetitive and turgid, relying on a simplicity that borders on the naive and comes across as shoddy writing. Lessing's pared-down style has, on occasion, functioned well as the vehicle for a teeming cargo of ideas; her priorities, she suggests, are elsewhere. Here, that stylistic inadequacy fails to evoke a sense of great ideas at play, creating instead disappointing longueurs (unfortunate in such a very short book) and an irritating feeling that one is being preached at rather than engaged in a dialogue. </p> <p>In part, that nagging doubt stems from a disjunction between the earlier novel and its sequel. In The Fifth Child the tension between realism and fable gave rise to a cleverly sustained sense of menace and unease. Like Ben's mother, the reader could experience both terror and pity in the face of this unknowable object, a product of her own body that was unmistakably alien to her and to us. But where the infant Ben suggested unpredictable and uncontainable evil, the adolescent/adult Ben has more of the circus freak about him, something between the noble savage and the wounded, exploited animal. His protectors are good, his exploiters are bad: the analysis rarely gets more sophisticated than that. </p> <p>If Lessing is trying to create an allegory - and various moralising passages and thinly veiled stabs at polemic hint that she might be - then she is scuppered by her central premise.

      "byline": "Chris Petit",

      "body": "<p><strong> Leadville: A Biography of the A40</strong> <br>Edward Platt <br>Picador, \u00a39.99, 304pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502444365,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The illusion, driving west out of London along the A40, is that conditions have improved over the last 20 years; for the driver, anyway. A stutter of traffic lights has been replaced by a series of flyovers and underpasses and a quasi-motorway that, out of rush hour, offers the fastest of any route out of London - apart from the clog-up between White City and Hangar Lane, the last stretch due for redevelopment until the Labour government scotched it. </p> <p>Getting in and out of London is a recurring problem in the city's history. Lack of military influence at government level meant that it never acquired the grand boulevards of other European capitals, built to facilitate troop movement. There was a radical highway programme after the second world war, but it fell out of fashion long before completion; its interrupted legacy can be seen in the tower blocks lining the Westway, including the now-fashionable Trellick. </p> <p>After the rooftop skim of the Westway, something goes badly wrong. A massive flashback occurs and the road reverts to what it was - a classic example of between-the-wars ribbon development, that aesthetically and environmentally deadly combination of dual carriageway bordered by cheap suburban housing, once offered as an ideal alternative to city-dwelling. Most of the houses are now boarded up and abandoned. Dereliction gives a futuristic, post-apocalyptic air, and the bizarre combination of bailiffs' grilles and former tweeness makes the area look like an Ealing Films version of Bladerunner, which is pretty much how Platt's book turns out. </p> <p> Leadville is not, as it claims, a biography of the A40 (which ends in Wales), but the story of how this particular section got left behind. It is a history of urban and transport planning, of the contrast between the clarity of the drawing board and the muddle of execution, and how that applies to those affected most, the local community. </p> <p>Five years ago, curiosity led Platt, a journalist living nearby, to start knocking on doors in order to find out the story behind these houses. The road was due for redevelopment and compulsory purchases were in order. Most residents greeted his approach with mild bemusement, but Platt persisted, finding a hypnotic beauty in the desolation. From a journalistic angle, however, he was chasing a non-story. The locals were either too old or resigned, and the squatters too disorganised; there was little concerted opposition beyond the odd individual effort and the occasional fractious housing-association meeting. </p> <p>This inertia is something of a surprise; from A Passport to Pimlico to EastEnders, the myth of the local community is deeply embedded in the national psyche. Platt's book gradually exposes the illusion of community and the way, as the social infrastructure breaks down, rumour and superstition replace it (ironic, given that part of the point of suburbia was the elimination of uncertainty). </p> <p>It was fear of political unrest that led to the Western Avenue development in the first place. In the aftermath of the first world war, suburbia was offered as the solution to Britain's housing problem (\"Homes for Heroes\") and an insurance against Bolshevism. In the inherent conservatism of suburban development, with its mock-Tudor facades and spurious appeal to an imaginary past, lay a political calculation. Lloyd George announced that these new houses - \"each with its own garden, surrounded by trees and hedges, and equipped internally with the amenities of a middle-class home\" - were to provide \"visible proof of the irrelevance of revolution\". Platt's book offers a bathetic coda to that vision. Three of the great false dawns of the 20th century - suburbia, modernism and the automobile - are mocked in all their deficiencies in that short stretch between the Westway and Gypsy Corner. </p> <p>Platt grows increasingly alert to the contradictions on offer. Urban abandon has let nature back in, a reminder that before this was tarmac, known originally as the \"road to nowhere\", it was allotments. The original policy of losing a returning army in the suburbs has a weird echo in the mindless violence done by bailiffs in their efforts to make the houses unsquattable.

      "bodyText": "Leadville: A Biography of the A40 Edward Platt Picador, \u00a39.99, 304pp Buy it at BOL The illusion, driving west out of London along the A40, is that conditions have improved over the last 20 years; for the driver, anyway. A stutter of traffic lights has been replaced by a series of flyovers and underpasses and a quasi-motorway that, out of rush hour, offers the fastest of any route out of London - apart from the clog-up between White City and Hangar Lane, the last stretch due for redevelopment until the Labour government scotched it. Getting in and out of London is a recurring problem in the city's history. Lack of military influence at government level meant that it never acquired the grand boulevards of other European capitals, built to facilitate troop movement. There was a radical highway programme after the second world war, but it fell out of fashion long before completion; its interrupted legacy can be seen in the tower blocks lining the Westway, including the now-fashionable Trellick. After the rooftop skim of the Westway, something goes badly wrong. A massive flashback occurs and the road reverts to what it was - a classic example of between-the-wars ribbon development, that aesthetically and environmentally deadly combination of dual carriageway bordered by cheap suburban housing, once offered as an ideal alternative to city-dwelling. Most of the houses are now boarded up and abandoned. Dereliction gives a futuristic, post-apocalyptic air, and the bizarre combination of bailiffs' grilles and former tweeness makes the area look like an Ealing Films version of Bladerunner, which is pretty much how Platt's book turns out. Leadville is not, as it claims, a biography of the A40 (which ends in Wales), but the story of how this particular section got left behind. It is a history of urban and transport planning, of the contrast between the clarity of the drawing board and the muddle of execution, and how that applies to those affected most, the local community. Five years ago, curiosity led Platt, a journalist living nearby, to start knocking on doors in order to find out the story behind these houses. The road was due for redevelopment and compulsory purchases were in order. Most residents greeted his approach with mild bemusement, but Platt persisted, finding a hypnotic beauty in the desolation. From a journalistic angle, however, he was chasing a non-story. The locals were either too old or resigned, and the squatters too disorganised; there was little concerted opposition beyond the odd individual effort and the occasional fractious housing-association meeting. This inertia is something of a surprise; from A Passport to Pimlico to EastEnders, the myth of the local community is deeply embedded in the national psyche. Platt's book gradually exposes the illusion of community and the way, as the social infrastructure breaks down, rumour and superstition replace it (ironic, given that part of the point of suburbia was the elimination of uncertainty). It was fear of political unrest that led to the Western Avenue development in the first place. In the aftermath of the first world war, suburbia was offered as the solution to Britain's housing problem (\"Homes for Heroes\") and an insurance against Bolshevism. In the inherent conservatism of suburban development, with its mock-Tudor facades and spurious appeal to an imaginary past, lay a political calculation. Lloyd George announced that these new houses - \"each with its own garden, surrounded by trees and hedges, and equipped internally with the amenities of a middle-class home\" - were to provide \"visible proof of the irrelevance of revolution\". Platt's book offers a bathetic coda to that vision. Three of the great false dawns of the 20th century - suburbia, modernism and the automobile - are mocked in all their deficiencies in that short stretch between the Westway and Gypsy Corner. Platt grows increasingly alert to the contradictions on offer. Urban abandon has let nature back in, a reminder that before this was tarmac, known originally as the \"road to nowhere\", it was allotments. The original policy of losing a returning army in the suburbs has a weird echo in the mindless violence done by bailiffs in their efforts to make the houses unsquattable. Platt writes of rooms looking as though they have been ripped apart by an explosion. Meanwhile, his own views on the car are as cheerfully muddled as most. The title of his book presumes an environmental stance, and his Peugot 205 seems to empathise (at first refusing to reverse and then, in a burst of eco-mindedness, starting to sprout moss in its interior). But in the end, after a belated acknowledgment of JG Ballard's Crash and the psychosexual pathology of an automobile culture, Platt extols \"the lubricious pleasures of driving on the Westway\". However, given the suburban and essentially English nature of his enterprise, perhaps the Ealing comedy analogy remains the most appropriate for Leadville - smug, heartless bureaucrats, lots of squatterspeak (same as it ever was) and a few shell-shocked old dears strayed out of One Foot in the Grave. Given that the BBC is within walking distance, it's a surprise that it hasn't already been turned into a sitcom.",

The cultural commissars of the Scottish mining town where she grew up in the 1950s rigorously enforced a strict lending policy. Readers were allowed to borrow up to four books as long at least two of them were non-fiction. </p> <p>\"It was a very puritanical and Protestant system,\" laughs McDermid. \"Agatha Christie had already been imprinted on me because Murder in the Vicarage was the only book in my grandparents' house, and I read all the classic English writers like Allingham, Marsh and Sayers. As I practically lived in the library, I was therefore made to read a lot of things like poetry and folk-tales that I never normally would have encountered had I been allowed to stay only with detective novels.\" </p> <p>With her literary base thus broadened, McDermid won a place at Oxford, where she discovered Hammett and Chandler and found, unexpectedly, that crime fiction received tacit approval. \"It wasn't treated exactly like literature, but it was thought to be almost respectable. It was the sort of thing I would see on a tutor's side table.\" </p> <p>As a student she did \"all the usual stuff; embarrassing poetry and song lyrics\". A few poems were published in small magazines, which gave her a taste for seeing her name in print. After university she enrolled on the Daily Mirror trainee journalist course. A year later, she graduated top of her year. She went on to run the Sunday People's northern news bureau in Manchester, and she still lives in the city. </p> <p>\"I was a complete news hack and had a lot of fun in newspapers for a long time,\" she says. \"It's hard to believe now, but we actually used to turn over wicked people and expose wrongdoing. We covered the abuse of old people in homes and the treatment of women in prison. But as the 1980s progressed, the obsession with the sex-lives of soap stars took over and I became very disillusioned.\" </p> <p>She says that in the back of her mind, journalism was always a temporary measure until she was able to become a full-time writer. She had a play broadcast on the radio but it was a creative false start. \"I didn't really understand what I was doing right with drama. So it was then kind of hard to replicate.\" </p> <p>Her continued interest in crime fiction led to a friend sending her Sarah Paretsky's first novel from the states. It was a decisive moment. \"I realised a crime novel didn't have to be set in a strange English village with a retired Indian colonel and some spinsters doing their knitting.\" </p> <p>McDermid's first novel, Report for Murder, was published in 1987. She drew upon her own life in the creation of lesbian journalist Lindsay Gordon as her central character. The book sold well, two more Lindsay Gordon books followed, and pretty soon McDermid became something of a spokesperson for the lesbian community. But she insisted that her books be displayed on the crime shelves in bookshops rather than in the gay and lesbian section. \"People who like crime fiction, whether gay or straight, will always go to the crime-fiction shelves before they go to the gay-and-lesbian shelves,\" she explains. </p> <p>When McDermid introduced a new leading character in her fourth book, the straight Manchester private eye Kate Brannigan, it precipitated predictable complaints that she had sold out. McDermid denies the charge but acknowledges an element of pragmatism. \"Of course the commercial consideration was there,\" she says. \"I wanted to be in a position where I could write full-time, and I wasn't going to be able to do that through writing lesbian crime fiction. But there were other reasons as well. I wanted to see if the female private eye novel could work in the UK. And there was the challenge as to whether I could write a character so different from myself.\" </p> <p>McDermid also knew the mind-set of crime readers. She guessed that if a mainstream audience enjoyed Kate Brannigan, they'd also check out Lindsay Gordon. Every time a new McDermid book has come out since - there have been six more Brannigans and five others - there has always been a kick in sales for the Lindsay Gordon series. </p> <p>Her latest book, A Place of Execution, is set geographically and chronologically close to the moors murders, which cropped up repeatedly during McDermid's journalistic career. Over the years she has interviewed the investigating police officers, the families of victims and Ian Brady's mother, and she is acutely aware of the sensitivities surrounding the case. </p> <p>\"I thought about it a lot. I couldn't not mention it, but equally I was aware of the charge of exploitation,\" she explains. \"This case still has huge sensitivity in the region, and rightly so. I eventually decided to refer obliquely to the real moors murders at the very beginning and let the readers bring their own resonances to the book.\" </p> <p>It is a captivating and emotionally dense read that more than holds its own against much contemporary mainstream fiction. As a critic, as well as a writer, McDermid has championed the literary merit of crime fiction, and she describes the last decade as a golden age. \"There has been a tremendous injection of talent and imagination into the genre,\" she says. \"There are novels written from every perspective and about every aspect of society. My own work reflects the level of diversity that is permissible. Quite frankly I don't see any limits and I'm happy to continue working in the genre.

Not much happens; he mithers about in Stockport (lying git told us he was from Manchester), fails to get the job I got at the NME, moves to London anyway, hypes Frankie Goes to Hollywood, does loads of drugs and drink and wakes up in the cold outer suburbs of youth to discover that - gasp! - his father's suicide has wiped out whole chunks of his memory.

Given this, I was rather expecting a load of trendy nonsense - and I certainly wasn't expecting to smile, having read some very sombre, macabre books bizarrely described by their publishers as comic. So I was somewhat surprised when, only 10 or 20 pages in, I found myself head down, absorbed in Harland Miller's eclectic anecdotal style. Dark as it was, I laughed out loud. </p> <p>Slow Down Arthur, Stick to Thirty is a tale of a northern town in the early 1980s, where the kids are getting out of it when they should really be getting out. Its structure is essentially Arabian Nights: one reminiscence arising from the ashes of another, a complete entertaining story on nearly every page. The narrator - or supposed diarist - is William Glover, aka \"Kid\", aka Nick Barrel, but the figure who strings the book together is Ziggy Hero (aka several other names), a David Bowie impersonator who faces the serious problem of trying to build a solid identity on the ever-shifting sands of Bowie's public image. </p> <p>Also featured are: the Undead - the kids who start out fresh-faced and bright as teds, mods, rockers, soulies or punks and end up as toothless alcoholics before they've hit 20; the Coneheads - a violent rabble of vandals identifiable by the inevitable orange traffic cones jammed onto their heads; various family members, including a father who thinks your boss might as well shoot you as retire you; the Yorkshire Ripper (off-stage but omnipresent); the Planet of the Mates - a troubling collection of individuals pally with the narrator who live in the Wigwam, a house-cum-building site. </p> <p>The theme is change, for and against; those waiting for change, those willing to change and those who vigorously beat up anyone who looks like they might be thinking about change in any shape or form. The chameleon Ziggy, glamorous and tarted up, trailing a gaggle of schoolgirl groupies, is an obvious target for assault. The plot, such as it is, involves the Kid's long wait for Ziggy to play his bound-to-be-amazing gig - a vaguely planned event that is constantly mutating due to Bowie's changing style. </p> <p>Most of the characters, including the narrator, end up in London, surely the northern tale's equivalent of getting the girl: a hotly desired outcome - but then, what next? The gig does happen eventually, but in another time and another space, when it is no longer clear whether it is a call to the future or a throwback to past times - yet it is a great success, in its own way.

Joshua Winter's father disappeared 12 years ago, and now Joshua has come back to London to find out what happened there. Meanwhile, an intercut narrative reveals the story of his father, who fled to Spain after a bungled porn-video scam led to murder. With its Essex men and its porno pivot, Cowley's book attempts to exploit a familiar patch of well-dodgy novelistic turf. </p> <p>Joshua is remarkably slow to realise that the people he meets on his quest, such as the charismatic Nicholas Dundee, are gangsters. It was Dundee who lunged out with the fatal knife 12 years before, but now he is a millionaire with a lovely little daughter. Given that his money comes from unspecified business interests in leisure and security, and that he lives in an Essex mansion bristling with surveillance cameras, readers might raise an eyebrow when Joshua innocently wonders, \"How could there be darkness in that life?\" </p> <p>Joshua's clumpingly ironic naivety is partly characterisation, but the novel is never as worldly as it would like to be. Small details - descriptions of tart cards or King's Cross street life - don't quite ring true. Nor does the violence. Joshua is followed from a club by three men, who beat him up. Afterwards, he has a flirtatious cup of tea with the woman outside whose house the assault took place (it's \"the comfort of strangers\"), despite the fact that such an attack would put most of us in casualty. </p> <p>Later, having inadvertently killed one of Dundee's henchmen, he gets home to find his lightbulbs removed and the dead body in his bathtub. Any normal reaction - the suppressed panic of checking if intruders are still in the flat, for example - is completely absent. Either Joshua has nerves of steel, or he's in a book that just doesn't convey the real bite of trauma. </p> <p>The book's most striking feature is its slightly bizarre prose style. Portentous and clich\u00e9-packed, it drips with ersatz drama. Joshua is back in \"a country I once called home. And now? Nothing but the slow desolation of early winter... and the mistakes we repeat\". The writing seems haunted by posturing crime cadences, with occasional more ambitious excursions: Joshua's father was \"absent without leave; in time, he was metaphysically absent, too, for in their hearts my family had abandoned him as dead\". Still, Unknown Pleasures has a functional plot and it works reasonably as a thriller. It's a brave Booker judge who dares to show the world his own book, but Cowley has acquitted himself. Just.</p>",

Meanwhile, an intercut narrative reveals the story of his father, who fled to Spain after a bungled porn-video scam led to murder. With its Essex men and its porno pivot, Cowley's book attempts to exploit a familiar patch of well-dodgy novelistic turf. Joshua is remarkably slow to realise that the people he meets on his quest, such as the charismatic Nicholas Dundee, are gangsters. It was Dundee who lunged out with the fatal knife 12 years before, but now he is a millionaire with a lovely little daughter. Given that his money comes from unspecified business interests in leisure and security, and that he lives in an Essex mansion bristling with surveillance cameras, readers might raise an eyebrow when Joshua innocently wonders, \"How could there be darkness in that life?\" Joshua's clumpingly ironic naivety is partly characterisation, but the novel is never as worldly as it would like to be. Small details - descriptions of tart cards or King's Cross street life - don't quite ring true. Nor does the violence. Joshua is followed from a club by three men, who beat him up. Afterwards, he has a flirtatious cup of tea with the woman outside whose house the assault took place (it's \"the comfort of strangers\"), despite the fact that such an attack would put most of us in casualty. Later, having inadvertently killed one of Dundee's henchmen, he gets home to find his lightbulbs removed and the dead body in his bathtub. Any normal reaction - the suppressed panic of checking if intruders are still in the flat, for example - is completely absent. Either Joshua has nerves of steel, or he's in a book that just doesn't convey the real bite of trauma. The book's most striking feature is its slightly bizarre prose style. Portentous and clich\u00e9-packed, it drips with ersatz drama. Joshua is back in \"a country I once called home. And now? Nothing but the slow desolation of early winter... and the mistakes we repeat\". The writing seems haunted by posturing crime cadences, with occasional more ambitious excursions: Joshua's father was \"absent without leave; in time, he was metaphysically absent, too, for in their hearts my family had abandoned him as dead\". Still, Unknown Pleasures has a functional plot and it works reasonably as a thriller. It's a brave Booker judge who dares to show the world his own book, but Cowley has acquitted himself. Just.",

      "body": "<p>Seidnaya is a Greek Orthodox convent in Syria, three hours' walk from Damascus. The monastery sits on a crag of rock overlooking the orchards and olive groves of the Damascene plain, more like a crusader castle than a place of worship. According to legend, the monastery was founded in the sixth century after the Byzantine Emperor Justinian chased a stag on to the top of the hill during a hunting expedition. Just as Justinian was about to draw his bow, the stag changed into the Virgin Mary, who commanded him to build a convent on the rock. Partly because of the reputedly miracle-working powers of one of the convent's icons, the abbey quickly become a place of pilgrimage. </p> <p>To this day streams of Christian, Muslim and Druze pilgrims trudge their way to Seidnaya from the mountains of Lebanon and the valleys of the Syrian jebel. A couple of years ago, while on a six-month tramp around the Middle East, I went to spend a night within its walls. By the time I arrived at the abbey church, it was after eight o'clock on a dark and cold winter's night. Two nuns in black veils were chanting from a lectern, while a priest, hidden behind the iconostasis, echoed their chants in a deep, reverberating bass. The only light came from a few flickering lamps suspended from the ceiling on gold chains. As the candlelight waxed and waned in the breeze, the highlights of the frescoes in the domes flashed into view, then disappeared again into the shadows. </p> <p>When the travel writer Colin Thubron visited the convent 30 years ago, he said he witnessed a miracle: he saw the face of the icon of Our Lady stream with tears. In the same church I too witnessed a miracle, or something that today would certainly be regarded as a miracle in almost any other Middle Eastern country. For the congregation in the church consisted not principally of Christians but almost entirely of heavily bearded Muslim men and their shrouded wives. As the priest circled the altar with his thurible, filling the sanctuary with great clouds of incense, the men bobbed up and down on their prayer mats as if in the middle of Friday prayers in a great mosque. The women mouthed prayers from the shadows. A few, closely watching the Christian women, went up to the icons hanging from the pillars; they kissed them, then lit a candle and placed it in front of the image. </p> <p>It was an extraordinary sight, yet this was, of course, the old way: the eastern Christians and the Muslims have lived side by side for nearly one and a half millennia and have been able to do so only due to a degree of mutual tolerance and shared customs unimaginable in the solidly Christian west. As one 17th-century Huguenot exile put it, \"There is no country on earth where the exercise of all religions is more free and less subject to being troubled than Turkey.\" </p> <p>The same broad tolerance that had given homes to the hundreds of thousands of Jews expelled by the bigoted Catholic kings from Spain and Portugal protected the eastern Christians in their ancient homelands. The result was that, from Bosnia to Egypt, Christians and Muslims, as well as many other religious minorities, managed to live together in closely knit communities in town after town, village after village across the Ottoman empire. If that coexistence was not always harmonious, it was at least - with a few notable exceptions - a kind of pluralist equilibrium. </p> <p>Only in the 20th century has that tolerance been replaced by a new hardening in attitudes. Across the length of the former Turkish empire, the last hundred years has seen, with the rise of education, self-consciousness and modern nationalism, the bloody unravelling of that complex tapestry - most recently and painfully in Kosovo and Bosnia, but before that in Cyprus, Palestine, Greece and Turkey. In each of these places pluralism has been replaced by a savage polarisation. In dribs and drabs, and sometimes in great tragic exoduses, religious minorities have fled to places where they can be majorities, and those too few for that have fled the region altogether. </p> <p>If the20th century has seen Europe change to a multicultural society, the same period has seen country after country in the Middle East change in the opposite direction, to a series of monolithic, monoethnic blocks. Only in Assad's Syria has this process been firmly arrested: here, alone in former Ottoman lands, you still find five or six different religions surviving side by side in villages across the country. </p> <p>The reason this Ottoman-like pluralism has survived in Syria is that the unspoken rules of Assad's Syria are - for better or worse - very similar to those in the old Turkish empire. Political activists are suppressed; an extensive network of secret police fills the prisons of Syria with political prisoners, many of whom will never come before a judge. Violent opposition to the regime is met with overwhelming force, most dramatically in the case of the armed rising of the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in 1982: the city was sealed off and at least 10,000 people were killed. </p> <p>But if Syria is a one-party police state, it is a police state that leaves its citizens alone as long as they keep out of politics. And if political freedoms have always been severely and often brutally restricted, Assad did allow his people - as the Ottomans had done before him - widespread cultural and religious freedoms. </p> <p> As the Syrian Orthodox Metropolitan of Aleppo, Mar Gregorios Yohanna Ibrahim, told me on my last visit: \"Christians are better off in Syria than anywhere else in the Middle East. Other than Lebanon, this is the only country in the region where a Christian can really feel the equal of a Muslim - and Lebanon, of course, has many other problems. In Syria there is no enmity between Christian and Muslim. If Syria were not here, we would be finished. It is a place of sanctuary, a haven for all the Christians: for the Nestorians driven out of Iraq, the Syrian Orthodox and the Armenians driven out of Turkey, even the Palestinian Christians driven out of the Holy Land by the Israelis. \" </p> <p>The reason for this is not hard to find. Assad was an Alawite, a Shia Muslim minority regarded by orthodox Sunni Muslims as heretical and disparagingly referred to as Nusayris (or Little Christians). Assad kept himself in power by forming what was in effect a coalition of Syria's many religious minorities - Shias, Druze, Yezidis, Christians and Alawites - through which he was able to counterbalance the weight of the Sunni majority. </p> <p> Over the last few days, the obituaries and news articles have almost universally portrayed Assad as a brutal despot with no saving graces. The flip side of the picture - notably his achievement in giving his country 30 years of stability after a run of 20 military coups in 24 years, and preserving Syria's traditions of pluralism and the safety of its minorities - have gone almost unreported.</p> <p> Reading the scathing obituaries in Istanbul this week, I thought back to that night in Seidnaya, and a conversation I had at the end of vespers with a young nun. I had remarked on the Muslims in the congregation and asked: was it unusual? \"The Muslims come here because they want babies,\" said the nun simply. \"Our Lady has shown her power and blessed many of the Muslims. The people started to talk about her and now more Muslims come here than Christians.\" As we were speaking, a Muslim couple approached us. The woman was veiled, only her nose and mouth visible through the black wraps; her husband, a burly man who wore his beard without a moustache, looked remarkably like the wilder sort of Hezbollah commander featured in news bulletins from southern Lebanon. But whatever his politics, he carried in one hand a heavy tin of olive oil and in the other a plastic basin full of fresh bread loaves. He gave both to the nun before retreating in embarrassment. </p> <p>\"They come in the evening,\" continued the nun. \"They make vows and then the women spend the night. They sleep on a blanket in front of the holy icon of Our Lady. Sometimes the women eat the wick of a lamp that has burned in front of the image, or maybe drink the holy oil. Nine months later they have babies.\"</p> <p> \"And it works?\" </p> <p>\"I have seen it with my own eyes,\" said Sister Tecla. \"One Muslim woman had been waiting for a baby for 20 years. She was beyond the normal age of childbearing but she came here and spent two nights in front of the icon. She was so desperate she ate the wicks of nearly 20 lamps.\" </p> <p>\"What happened?\" </p> <p>\"She came back the following year,\" said Sister Tecla, \"with triplets.\" Sister Tecla kissed an icon, then turned back to face me: \"Like most of the Muslims, she has promised to christen the children.\" </p> <p>Such pluralism would be unthinkable almost anywhere else in the Middle East today; and after what we have seen of the suffering of the former Yugoslavia, we should recognise its rarity and value. Preserving this rich pluralism remains Hafiz al-Assad's most remarkable achievement. </p> <p>\u0095 William Dalrymple is the author of From the Holy Mountain (Flamingo, \u00a38.99).

He gave both to the nun before retreating in embarrassment. \"They come in the evening,\" continued the nun. \"They make vows and then the women spend the night. They sleep on a blanket in front of the holy icon of Our Lady. Sometimes the women eat the wick of a lamp that has burned in front of the image, or maybe drink the holy oil. Nine months later they have babies.\" \"And it works?\" \"I have seen it with my own eyes,\" said Sister Tecla. \"One Muslim woman had been waiting for a baby for 20 years. She was beyond the normal age of childbearing but she came here and spent two nights in front of the icon. She was so desperate she ate the wicks of nearly 20 lamps.\" \"What happened?\" \"She came back the following year,\" said Sister Tecla, \"with triplets.\" Sister Tecla kissed an icon, then turned back to face me: \"Like most of the Muslims, she has promised to christen the children.\" Such pluralism would be unthinkable almost anywhere else in the Middle East today; and after what we have seen of the suffering of the former Yugoslavia, we should recognise its rarity and value. Preserving this rich pluralism remains Hafiz al-Assad's most remarkable achievement. \u0095 William Dalrymple is the author of From the Holy Mountain (Flamingo, \u00a38.99).

      "body": "<p>It would probably never have occurred to me to write a play about the Salem witch trials of 1692 had I not seen some astonishing correspondences with that calamity in the America of the late 40s and early 50s. My basic need was to respond to a phenomenon which, with only small exaggeration, one could say paralysed a whole generation and in a short time dried up the habits of trust and toleration in public discourse.</p> <p>I refer to the anti-communist rage that threatened to reach hysterical proportions and sometimes did. I can\u2019t remember anyone calling it an ideological war, but I think now that that is what it amounted to. I suppose we rapidly passed over anything like a discussion or debate, and into something quite different, a hunt not just for subversive people, but for ideas and even a suspect language. The object was to destroy the least credibility of any and all ideas associated with socialism and communism, whose proponents were assumed to be either knowing or unwitting agents of Soviet subversion.</p> <p>An ideological war is like guerrilla war, since the enemy is an idea whose proponents are not in uniform but are disguised as ordinary citizens, a situation that can scare a lot of people to death. To call the atmosphere paranoid is not to say that there was nothing real in the American-Soviet stand-off. But if there was one element that lent the conflict a tone of the inauthentic and the invented, it was the swiftness with which all values were forced in months to reverse themselves.</p> <p>Death of a Salesman opened in February 1949 and was hailed by nearly every newspaper and magazine. Several movie studios wanted it and finally Columbia Pictures bought it, and engaged a great actor, Frederick March, to play Willy [the central character].</p> <p>In two years or less, with the picture finished, I was asked by a terrified Columbia to sign an anti-communist declaration to ward off picket lines which the rightwing American Legion was threatening to throw across the entrances of theatres showing the film. In the phone calls that followed, the air of panic was heavy. It was the first intimation of what would soon follow. I declined to make any such statement, which I found demeaning; what right had any organisation to demand anyone\u2019s pledge of loyalty? I was sure the whole thing would soon go away; it was just too outrageous.</p> <p>But instead of the problem disappearing, the studio actually made another film, a short to be shown with Salesman. This was called The Life of a Salesman and consisted of several lectures by City College School of Business professors - which boiled down to selling was a joy, one of the most gratifying and useful professions, and that Willy was simply a nut. Never in show-business history has a studio spent so much good money to prove that its feature film was pointless. In less than two years Death of a Salesman had gone from being a masterpiece to being a heresy, and a fraudulent one at that.</p> <p>In 1948-51, I had the sensation of being trapped inside a perverse work of art, one of those Escher constructs in which it is impossible to make out whether a stairway is going up or down. Practically everyone I knew stood within the conventions of the political left of centre; one or two were Communist party members, some were fellow-travellers, and most had had a brush with Marxist ideas or organisations. I have never been able to believe in the reality of these people being actual or putative traitors any more than I could be, yet others like them were being fired from teaching or jobs in government or large corporations. The surreality of it all never left me. We were living in an art form, a metaphor that had suddenly, incredibly, gripped the country.</p> <p>In today\u2019s terms, the country had been delivered into the hands of the radical right, a ministry of free-floating apprehension toward anything that never happens in the middle of Missouri. It is always with us, this anxiety, sometimes directed towards foreigners, Jews, Catholics, fluoridated water, aliens in space, masturbation, homosexuality, or the Internal Revenue Department. But in the 50s any of these could be validated as real threats by rolling out a map of China. And if this seems crazy now, it seemed just as crazy then, but openly doubting it could cost you.</p> <p>So in one sense The Crucible was an attempt to make life real again, palpable and structured. One hoped that a work of art might illuminate the tragic absurdities of an anterior work of art that was called reality, but was not. It was the very swiftness of the change that lent it this surreality. Only three or four years earlier an American movie audience, on seeing a newsreel of Stalin saluting the Red Army, would have applauded, for that army had taken the brunt of the Nazi onslaught, as most people were aware. Now they would look on with fear or at least bewilderment, for the Russians had become the enemy of mankind, a menace to all that was good. It was the Germans who, with amazing rapidity, were turning good. Could this be real?</p> <p>In the unions, communists and their allies, known as intrepid organisers, were to be shorn of membership and turned out as seditious. Harry Bridges, the idol of west coast longshoremen, whom he had all but single-handedly organised, was subjected to trial after trial to drive him back to his native Australia as an unadmitted communist. Academics, some prominent in their fields, were especially targeted, many forced to retire or fired for disloyalty. Some were communists, some were fellow travellers and, inevitably, a certain number were unaffiliated liberals refusing to sign one of the dozens of humiliating anti-communist pledges being required by terrified college administrations.</p> <p>But it is impossible to convey properly the fears that marked that period. Nobody was shot, to be sure, although some were going to jail, where at least one, William Remington, was murdered by an inmate hoping to shorten his sentence by having killed a communist. Rather than physical fear, it was the sense of impotence, which seemed to deepen with each week, of being unable to speak accurately of the very recent past when being leftwing in America, and for that matter in Europe, was to be alive to the dilemmas of the day.</p> <p>As for the idea of willingly subjecting my work not only to some party\u2019s discipline but to anyone\u2019s control, my repugnance was such that, as a young and indigent writer, I had turned down lucrative offers to work for Hollywood studios because of a revulsion at the thought of someone owning the paper I was typing on. It was not long, perhaps four or five years, before the fraudulence of Soviet cultural claims was as clear to me as it should have been earlier. But I would never have found it believable, in the 50s or later, that with its thuggish self-righteousness and callous contempt for artists\u2019 freedoms, that the Soviet way of controlling culture could be successfully exported to America.</p> <p>Some greatly talented people were driven out of the US to work in England: screenwriters like Carl Foreman and Donald Ogden Stewart, actors like Charlie Chaplin and Sam Wanamaker. I no longer recall the number of our political exiles, but it was more than too many and disgraceful for a nation prideful of its democracy.</p> <p>Writing now, almost half a century later, with the Soviet Union in ruins, China rhetorically fending off capitalism even as in reality it adopts a market economy, Cuba wallowing helplessly in the Caribbean, it is not easy to convey the American fear of a masterful communism. The quickness with which Soviet-style regimes had taken over eastern Europe and China was breathtaking, and I believe it stirred up a fear in Americans of our own ineptitudes, our mystifying inability, despite our military victories, to control the world whose liberties we had so recently won back from the Axis powers.</p> <p>In 1956, the House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) subpoenaed me - I was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to identify writers I had met at one of the two communist writers\u2019 meetings I had attended many years before. By then, the tide was going out for Huac and it was finding it more difficult to make front pages. However, the news of my forthcoming marriage to Marilyn Monroe was too tempting to be passed. That our marriage had some connection with my being subpoenaed was confirmed when Chairman Walters of the Huac sent word to Joseph Rauh, my lawyer, that he would be inclined to cancel my hearing if Miss Monroe would consent to have a picture taken with him.</p> <p>The offer having been declined, the good chairman, as my hearing came to an end, entreated me to write less tragically about our country. This lecture cost me $40,000 in lawyer\u2019s fees, a year\u2019s suspended sentence for contempt of Congress, and a $500 fine. Not to mention about a year of inanition in my creative life.</p> <p>My fictional view of the period, my sense of its unreality had been, like any impotence, a psychologically painful experience. A similar paralysis descended on Salem. In both places, to keep social unity intact, the authority of leaders had to be hardened and words of scepticism toward them constricted. A new cautionary diction, an uncustomary prudence inflected our way of talking to one another. The word socialism was all but taboo. Words had gotten fearsome. As I learned directly in Ann Arbor on a 1953 visit, university students were avoiding renting rooms in houses run by the housing cooperative for fear of being labelled communist, so darkly suggestive was the word cooperative. The head of orientation at the university told me, in a rather cool, uninvolved manner, that the FBI was enlisting professors to report on students voicing leftwing opinions, and - more comedy - that they had also engaged students to report on professors with the same views.</p> <p>In the early 50s, along with Elia Kazan, who had directed All My Sons and Death of a Salesman, I submitted a script to Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures. It described the murderous corruption in the gangster-ridden Brooklyn longshoremen\u2019s union. Cohn read the script and called us to Hollywood, where he casually informed us that he had had the script vetted by the FBI, and that they had seen nothing subversive in it. But the head of the AFL motion picture unions in Hollywood, Roy Brewer, had condemned it as untrue communist propaganda, since there were no gangsters on the Brooklyn waterfront. Cohn, no stranger to gangsterism, having survived an upbringing in the tough Five Points area of Manhattan, opined that Brewer was only trying to protect Joe Ryan, head of the Brooklyn longshoremen (who, incidentally, would go to Sing Sing prison for gangsterism).</p> <p>Brewer threatened to call a strike of projectionists in any theatre daring to show the film. Cohn offered his solution to the problem: he would produce the film if I would make one change - the gangsters in the union were to be changed to communists. This would not be easy; I knew all the communists on the waterfront- there were two of them (both of whom in the following decade became millionaire businessmen). So I had to withdraw the script, which prompted an indignant telegram from Cohn: \u201cAs soon as we try to make the script pro-American you pull out.\u201d One understood not only the threat but also the cynicism: he knew the mafia controlled waterfront labour. Had I been a movie writer, my career would have ended. But the theatre had no such complications, no blacklist - not yet - and I longed to respond to this climate of fear, if only to protect my sanity. But where to find a transcendent concept?</p> <p>The heart of the darkness was the belief that a massive, profoundly organised conspiracy was in place and carried forward mainly by a concealed phalanx of intellectuals, including labour activists, teachers, professionals, sworn to undermine the American government. And it was precisely the invisibility of ideas that was frightening so many people. How could a play deal with this mirage world?</p> <p>Paranoia breeds paranoia, but below paranoia there lies a bristling, unwelcome truth, so repugnant as to produce fantasies of persecution to conceal its existence. The unwelcome truth denied by the right was that the Hollywood writers accused of subversion were not a menace to the country, or even bearers of meaningful change. They wrote not propaganda but entertainment, some of it of a mildly liberal cast, but most of it mindless, or when it was political, as with Preston Sturges or Frank Capra, entirely and exuberantly un-Marxist.</p> <p>As for the left, its unacknowledged truth was more important for me. If nobody was being shot in our ideological war but merely vivisected by a headline, it struck me as odd, if understandable , that the accused were unable to cry out passionately their faith in the ideals of socialism. There were attacks on the Huac\u2019s right to demand that a citizen reveal his political beliefs; but on the idealistic canon of their own convictions, the defendants were mute. The rare exception, like Paul Robeson\u2019s declaration of faith in socialism as a cure for racism, was a rocket that lit up the sky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/17/books.guardianreview12\">More...</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Nawal El Saadawi liked school. Her favourite lessons were art and literature. History bored her. It made heroes out of corrupt rulers and told her nothing about the British invasion of her country. She wanted to become a writer but her father said there was no future for writers in Egypt. They live and die in poverty, he said. </p> <p>Her parents had pinned their hopes on her older brother, but he failed at school time after time, while she soared. She grew tall, too, and when she hit her teens she trained herself to sleep curled up like an embryo and walk with a stoop to counter what she had read was \"manliness\". For her parents, the image of their daughter's future - wearing a traditional wedding dress - was slowly replaced by that of a tall, slender woman enveloped in a lawyer's robe, or a doctor's white coat. </p> <p>Her parents may have treated her brother preferentially but the favoritism could have been much worse, she says. Her family was educated and her father, a teacher, was broadminded. And yet she felt her brother could move freely while she had to sit politely. Her grandmother would counter her protestations by telling her to control her \"long tongue\". </p> <p>But what was not said was written. One day her Arabic teacher asked the class to write an imaginative story. She handed in the novel she had secretly written. It tracked a 12-year-old girl's doubts about religious ritual and parental rules. (\"The child is myself,\" El Saadawi says now.) She was 14. Her teacher gave her a zero and scrawled on her story \"strange distorted ideas which should never occur to a girl of your age\". </p> <p>The zero was to be the first of many rebuffs that El Saadawi has received for her writing. But there have been many accolades too. Since 1957, when her first novel was published, she has written 32 books, including articles, short stories, plays, memoirs, polemics and novels covering Arab women, colonialism, fundamentalism and globalisation - red flags to many bulls. She writes in Arabic and almost all her books have been translated, into more than 30 languages; 27 into English and 14 into Japanese. </p> <p>The novelist and activist, who trained as a doctor, has survived censorship, incarceration and, most recently, exile, for putting pen to paper. Despite the efforts of her teacher, El Saadawi is the leading voice of her generation on the status of Arab women. She compares a pen to a scalpel. \"Words should not seek to please,\" she writes in A Daughter of Isis, the first part of her autobiography, adding that words \"should not hide the wounds in our bodies, the shameful moments in our lives.\" When she was six, she underwent a clitorectomy at the hands of a daya (midwife), who said it was the will of God. Nawal called for her mother to rescue her, only to find that she had been present all along. </p> <p>She later wrote a letter to God saying, \"I'm not ready to believe in you if you're not just.\" Everywhere she looked she saw \"double standards, contradictions and injustices. That's why I don't agree with religion,\" she says. \"All religion is political. It's full of war and peace, economics and sexuality.\" Her father made his children pray, but told them not to believe in God unless they were convinced of his existence. This played a major role in the young El Saadawi's development. \"I never feared discussing whether God existed or not,\" she says. </p> <p>Her first lessons in philosophy, religion and politics were learnt, she says in Kafr Tahla, her father's obscure village on the Nile. Her paternal grandmother, an illiterate peasant would say to the village headman: \"We are not slaves, and Allah is justice.\" Her mother was from an upper-middle class family. Her maternal grandfather's house in Cairo, a villa with a garden was \"like a palace\" compared to the village home where the family slept on mats laid on the dust floor. Levels of education, \"the way they talked,\" also contrasted. \"I was brought up between two classes,\" El Saadawi says. \"Peasant and bourgeois.\" Physically, she moved between the two houses, but it was the village that she thought of as home. </p> <p>El Saadawi was the second child of nine. Her mother's loving care made her childhood very happy. Her father was a just and kind man who never raised his voice. He was \"atypical. I wasn't brought up by a masculine man. That's why I had such problems with men,\" she says. When he came home from work, he laid the table, prepared food, washed the pots and pans and sewed his own clothes. When Nawal was four the family moved to Alexandria. Her mother became more distant and Nawal became closer to her father. He had marched against the British in the 1919 revolution and was active in anti-colonial struggle. \"Because of my father I lived politics every day.\" </p> <p>In 1938, when she was seven, the government transferred him to the small town of Menouf in the middle of the Nile delta - punishment for his participation in student demonstrations against the acceptance of British rule by the Egyptian king and his government. She loved to listen to her revolutionary father but his words were always addressed to her brother. Her job was to take care of her younger siblings. \"A boy's childhood is much longer,\" she says. Her brothers and sisters were never friends. \"Their way of thinking is totally different. They conform.\" Her sisters cover their heads. Her brothers are very religious. \"They never challenged. Maybe they never faced the obstacles I did. \" </p> <p>She didn't want to be a doctor, but a girl with good grades had to do something respectable. She won a scholarship and went to medical school \"to satisfy my parents\" and dreamed of being an artist, a singer, a musician, a painter. \"I hated doctors, death and disease.\" Her graduation from Cairo University's medical school in 1955 left her \"more ignorant than when I entered\". It began her slow-burning disillusionment with the idea that illnesses could be cured by medicine alone. </p> <p>She had joined other students on the streets in demonstrations against the British occupation of Egypt and began to write articles for Egyptian newspapers about the links she had seen between poverty and disease. Her reading widened to sociology, philosophy, religion and literature. \"To see the human body as a whole, to see society and knowledge as a whole,\" has been her life's work she says. \"To break down and analyse, only to build up and synthesise. This was my progression from the particular to the general, from the personal to the political, from one woman to all women, from the individual to the collective.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi, now 68, is acknowledged as a uniquely powerful voice in the international women's movement. \"She's an amazing gift to the movement,\" says Beatrix Campbell, the writer and broadcaster, who met her in the mid-80s at a rally in Hyde Park in support of the miners' strike. \"She was a woman who in that period of British feminism was a remarkable presence. She was one of the first to initiate the engagement between black and white feminists.\" </p> <p>Women And Sex, her first work of non-fiction, slashed at the mythology surrounding sex, virginity and marriage. Until then she had written novels as well as newspaper articles drawn from her observations as a rural doctor in the 1950s. Women And Sex, published in 1971, when she was Egypt's director general of public health, went much further. El Saadawi became the first Arab woman to write against female circumcision, arguing that it stems from the ancient practice of monogamy for women and polygamy for men. </p> <p>Because of the ensuing controversy she lost her job as well as her seat on the board of the government medical syndicate in 1972. Her writing was banned. The magazine she edited about social influences on health was closed down. \"I think women can be easily attacked, \" she says. \"They said I was promiscuous. Oh yes, they said everything.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi's own writing is often a form of attack, delivered behind a shield of scholarly authority. She relates the history of Arab women's liberation to the anti-colonial struggle. Her novels veer towards reportage: clear and precise accounts of stories previously untold. \"I have my utmost pleasure when I'm writing my novels,\" she says. \"It's the present tense, the here and now, that I enjoy. It's my constitution. I love novels more than anything because they help us to understand.\" </p> <p>She was cooped-up in Cairo writing from home following her censorship in 1972. While her work was sent to Beirut to be published, she felt isolated. In 1978 she took up a post with the United Nations as an adviser on women's development. The job took her all over the middle east and Africa. In retrospect, she says, it was way of seeing for herself \"that the UN was not seriously interested in either development or women\". </p> <p>In 1981, a year after she returned to Cairo, Sadat put her in jail along with more than 1,000 others for \"crimes against the state\". She hid her pen and notes written on toilet paper in a camouflaged hole in her cell. These notes were to become Memoirs From A Women's Prison, an account of the \"terrible\" months she spent in a jail bursting with prisoners. </p> <p>She shared a cell with 12 others, some imprisoned for their fundamentalism, others for their Marxism, but all facing the grim daily reality of bread and beans with worms, the floor or plank of wood for a bed, the fleas and the bugs. Obedience, El Saadawi says, was the only way to avoid being beaten. </p> <p>Imprisonment accentuated life, she says. \"I remember anger and extreme happiness,\" she says. Simple things such as the smell of tea made her ecstatic. Her release after three months was thanks to Sadat's assassination and the succession of the present Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. </p> <p>\"Hers was a project of social-realism: to speak of all those things that had never been said,\" says the writer and poet Michele Roberts, who met El Saadawi in London in the early 80s. \" Many British women read her books. We shared the ideology of novel writing. We believed in telling the truth and that novels could testify and effect social reality.\" </p> <p>In 1993, with Muslim fundamentalism growing in Egypt, her name was put on a death-list. Government security guards surrounded her home and a bodyguard trailed her. She believed the government was largely to blame for religious extremism and was suspicious of the guards. With her husband, she boarded a plane for North Carolina in the United States. She watched Egypt from a distance and taught a course at Duke University about the experience - Dissidence and Creativity. Exile made her feel \"like a fish outside the sea\". She was homesick. \"Life became very dear,\" she says. \"I felt death was over my head like a big black cloud. So I wanted to write my life. I became very sensual. I loved food. I loved sex. That's how we survive.\" </p> <p>In the 80s she had become involved with British political campaigns: the miners' strike, Greenham common, sit-ins against NHS cuts, demonstrations against the National Front, CND.Her position as an eastern intellectual embraced by the west has led her work to be simultaneously used in the west to justify objections to Islam while in the east there are hopes that her writing will serve as an antidote to western misconceptions about Arab women as supine, veiled creatures in need of rescuing. </p> <p>\"She had a knowledge and critique of British feminism while British feminism didn't have a confident engagement with African or middle eastern feminism,\" says Beatrix Campbell. \"Here was a woman sustained by feminism and in an argument with it. And while defending her own society in an argument with it and ours.\" </p> <p> The arguments, when first expressed, were revelatory. It is not Islam, she argued, that oppressed women in the Arab Islamic countries, but the inability of Arab people to take control of their economic potential and resources. \"I have never separated women's liberation from the liberation of my country,\" she says. Economics, she argues shapes the standards and values of all religions. She rails against the prevalent conception of women's liberation as a western invention that has trickled to women in the east. </p> <p>Lives have been changed by El Saadawi. Marlyn Tadros first met her in 1988 at a book fair in Cairo. At the time Tadros was 28 and had worked as an air-hostess, but her husband had confiscated her passport. She had just read The Hidden Face Of Eve, El Saadawi's 1980 work on the status of women in Arab countries. \"It was only Nawal who said how I felt was unnatural,\" she says. \"When you live in a mainstream that tells you 'this is natural' it's extremely empowering to find someone out there who thinks differently.\" Tadros, now the senior director of programmes for a human rights organisation, after a stint as a visiting fellow at Harvard, cites this meeting as the beginning of her own activism. </p> <p>El Saadawi writes in The Hidden Face Of Eve: \"There are still so many thinkers . . . who wish to separate the arduous struggles of women for self-emancipation from the revolt of the people everywhere.\" What we share rather than what separates us interests her. She tells a story about how, when giving a lecture in the States, a woman in the audience asked: \"how do you explain why some Muslim women want to wear the veil?\" She relishes her reply: \"In the same way that I'd explain why you choose to wear make-up. Like make-up, it hides the face of women. They both show conformity to a culture's idea of what is feminine.\" </p> <p>Her analysis is a series of cultural and political dot-to-dots. \"I think clitorectomy is done to all women,\" she says. \"Be it physical, psychological, educational. When Freud said the clitoris is a male organ in a female body and clitoral orgasm is related to childhood he cut the clitoris psychologically because he abolished its function.\" </p> <p>Unusually for an Egyptian woman, El Saadawi has married three times; the first time, aged 24, to a fellow student two years her senior at medical school. Like her father, he was active in the anti-colonial struggle; a guerrilla fighter against the British military occupation of the Suez Canal. Nationalist sentiment and the humiliation of the Egyptian armed forces during the war against the newly independent state of Israel precipitated a coup, led by Mohammed Neguib in July 1952, in which the ruling King Farouk was deposed. When Neguib's political rival Gamal Abdel Nasser assumed power two years later, El Saadawi's first husband came out of hiding and returned to her. But he had become embittered and disturbed by his enforced self-exile and fled to upper Egypt, racked with depression. </p> <p>\"The depression added to his patriarchal tendencies,\" she says. \"I was a successful doctor. He tried to dominate me.\" The couple had a daughter, Mona, now 44, a writer and essayist living in Cairo. When El Saadawi's salary could no longer stretch to supporting her husband and their daughter, she turned to her father. He helped her get a divorce and she lived with her parents in Giza, a district of Cairo, until they died a couple of years later. Her second husband, a lawyer, hated being married to a woman who ruffled so many feathers, and they divorced within a year. \"I didn't love him very much but he said he'd accept my conditions. I needed a partner. A secret love affair would have ruined my career. The social pressure to be married was great.\" </p> <p>In 1964 she married Sherif Hetata, a doctor, writer and activist. They have a son, Araf, now 39, a film director, who lives in Cairo. Hetata is her English translator and companion. They are a beautiful, entertaining double act: \"I wanted to be with a political man,\" she says. \"That's not what you told me,\" he interrupts. \"You said you wanted to marry a man who'd been in prison.\" They met at the ministry of health, where he was setting up a rural health programme. He had just been released from a 14-year prison sentence for membership of a communist party that had criticised Nasser's regime. Hetata \"was sure of himself, thoughtful, calm and serious,\" she says. \"I felt I could trust him.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi has never belonged to a political party. \"I was never a Marxist, never a communist. Why should I belong to Marx, or Nasser or Sadat and abolish my name? Marx is a man who created a theory. We can all be philosophers. I was always just myself.\" </p> <p>It is an attitude that over the years has made her enemies and brought her criticism. Marlyn Tadros says El Saadawi is a pioneer \"but she's a very, very difficult person and I don't want to stay around her. She has to have everything her way. There's often only a semblance of democracy. Her self-confidence goes against her.\" Recognition for pioneering work, Tadros says, is particularly hard to come by in Egypt and the middle east, and so El Saadawi \"has to act up for it. She has been isolated by the women's movement in Egypt - other feminists have not included her in projects.\" </p> <p>Beatrix Campbell says British feminism \"deified\" El Saadawi. \"There's always a risk that black women are rarefied, exoticised and isolated. It's easier for the white world if there's only one different voice. It doesn't have to deal with the clamouring; all those things that different people have to say. El Saadawi moved very easily in a white woman's world. She was received as a lone star.\" </p> <p>It is a position that makes Yasmin Alibhai Brown, a commentator on race affairs, uncomfortable. \"There was something alarming about the way one woman's life was grabbed and used to simplify all Arab women's lives. She's from that final wave of colonialism where being a member of the international westernised elite was desirable. There are new kinds of writers now.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi's friend of 20 years, Haleh Afshar, professor of politics and women's studies at York University, says that El Saadawi has been bashed both ways. \"In the States she is often seen as an eastern intellectual exotic on the sidelines. She is no longer a prophet in her own land, and she wasn't one in the States.\" </p> <p>At the beginning of this year, after six years' exile in the United States, El Saadawi returned to Egypt to finish the third and final part of her autobiography. Mubarak's government, itself threatened by the extremist Islamic groups that wanted her dead, is now beginning to tackle them, she says. She feels safer. Part one of her memoir, covering the first 24 years of her life, is a sensuous recollection: the smell of her mother's skin, the pain in her growing bones. </p> <p>Back home in Egypt, other women have been slogging away to change the nitty-gritty details of areas such as the law, health and education to improve women's lives. They are not starry-eyed over El Saadawi. Hala Shukrallah, a member of the New Women Research Centre in Cairo, which campaigns, offers legal support and community-based projects for women's rights, is unequivocal about how El Saadawi's absence from grassroots activism in Egypt has diminished her significance there. \"She was important in the 70s but I don't think she's had an influence in the 90s,\" she says. \"She's not here. When you're not here and not struggling on the same level, you're out of it. She's been shaped by her audience and has directed her work to the west when she's there. That's natural.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi compares herself to a horse jumping over obstacles. \"When I clear one jump, the next is higher.\" She has set herself some tough hurdles. She was among a delegation of nine women to Baghdad a month before the expiry of the UN deadline and the outbreak of the Gulf war in 1991. She met the UN secretary-general in New York and toured the US for two weeks to rally support for peace and an Arab solution to the war. The initiative grew out of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association, the first pan-Arab organisation to be accorded international status at the UN, which El Saadawi founded to counter \"the isolation\" of writing. The government closed the Egyptian branch of the association later that year. </p> <p>She appeared at the 1985 United Nations women's conference in Nairobi, but did not attend the international debate in Beijing a decade later. Why not? \"I received an invitation,\" she says. \"But after the UN's intervention and collaboration with western powers in the Gulf war it became the United Nations of America for me: a tool in the hands of global capitalist powers. I'm wasting my time going. Women will never be liberated if the UN is involved.\" </p> <p>The world has not turned out in the way that El Saadawi once hoped. \"Those countries with global power bring barriers between countries so capital can flow more easily. They speak about diversity, freedom, multiculturalism, and divide people by religion and race in the name of post- modernism. We should be undoing the differences between us.\" </p> <p>Haleh Afshar detects a lament for lost opportunities in El Saadawi's autobiography. \"It's full of bitterness and sadness,\" she says. \"Nawal started in an era where modernity and progress meant that a young woman from a village could, as she did, become a government minister. You can't do that in Egypt today. There is less social mobility. She had a vision that didn't come good. It's so different from the exuberant, lively person she is.\" </p> <p>El Saadawi's journey between Cairo and the village is all the travelling she wants to do for now. She and Hetata have built a small house in his family village just north of hers in the middle of the delta. They go there two or three times a year to write and relax, she says. The village is \"typical - just fields, animals everywhere, small streets and children running around\". Every other year she will spend a month teaching at Florida Atlantic University. Dissidence and creativity will still be her subject. </p> <p>Next month she must submit the third and final part of her autobiography to her Egyptian publishers. More meetings are planned to discuss setting up an Egyptian women's union. El Saadawi hopes as always that links will form between the fragments. She's trying to find \"a charismatic woman\" to lead it. She's very busy with her writing these days. The movement needs someone less controversial, she says. Someone with a clean slate. \"I'm arguing,\" she says, \"that it may be better for the union to have a young woman leading it.\" </p> <p>Will she miss America? \"I miss teaching. It allows me to speak my mind but I was always going to be an alien there. I needed to be near my children, my village, my friends. I told Sherif that it's better to die here. But wherever I am I'm criticising the government. Now I feel at home in every country. I feel as if I belong to the world,\" she smiles. \"I don't belong to a certain place.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p> <strong> Born:</strong><br> 1931 Kafr Tahal, Egypt.</p> <p> <strong> Education:</strong><br> Helwan school, Cairo; 1949-55 Cairo University (doctor of medicine); 1966 Columbia University New York (masters in public health).</p> <p> <strong> Married:</strong><br> 1955-57 Ahmed Elmy (one daughter); 1960-61 [name with held]; 1964- Sherif Hetata (one son). </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> <br>1956-8 medical officer, Cairo Hospital University;1958-9 village doctor; 1966-72 director general of public health, Egyptian ministry of health; 1978-90 head of UN women's programme in economic commission for Africa; 1982- president, Arab women's solidarity association. </p> <p><strong> Some books</strong><br> (English translations): 1972 Women And Sex; 1980 The Hidden Face Of Eve; 1982 Woman At Point Zero; 1984 God Dies By The Nile; 1987 The Fall Of The Imam; 1985 Memoirs From The Women's Prison; 1992 The Well Of Life; 1999, A Daughter of Isis. </p> <p>\u0095 The first part of Nawal El Saadawi's autobiography, A Daughter Of Isis, is published by Zed Books at \u00a314.95.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nawal El Saadawi liked school. Her favourite lessons were art and literature. History bored her. It made heroes out of corrupt rulers and told her nothing about the British invasion of her country. She wanted to become a writer but her father said there was no future for writers in Egypt. They live and die in poverty, he said. Her parents had pinned their hopes on her older brother, but he failed at school time after time, while she soared. She grew tall, too, and when she hit her teens she trained herself to sleep curled up like an embryo and walk with a stoop to counter what she had read was \"manliness\". For her parents, the image of their daughter's future - wearing a traditional wedding dress - was slowly replaced by that of a tall, slender woman enveloped in a lawyer's robe, or a doctor's white coat. Her parents may have treated her brother preferentially but the favoritism could have been much worse, she says. Her family was educated and her father, a teacher, was broadminded. And yet she felt her brother could move freely while she had to sit politely. Her grandmother would counter her protestations by telling her to control her \"long tongue\". But what was not said was written. One day her Arabic teacher asked the class to write an imaginative story. She handed in the novel she had secretly written. It tracked a 12-year-old girl's doubts about religious ritual and parental rules. (\"The child is myself,\" El Saadawi says now.) She was 14. Her teacher gave her a zero and scrawled on her story \"strange distorted ideas which should never occur to a girl of your age\". The zero was to be the first of many rebuffs that El Saadawi has received for her writing. But there have been many accolades too. Since 1957, when her first novel was published, she has written 32 books, including articles, short stories, plays, memoirs, polemics and novels covering Arab women, colonialism, fundamentalism and globalisation - red flags to many bulls. She writes in Arabic and almost all her books have been translated, into more than 30 languages; 27 into English and 14 into Japanese. The novelist and activist, who trained as a doctor, has survived censorship, incarceration and, most recently, exile, for putting pen to paper. Despite the efforts of her teacher, El Saadawi is the leading voice of her generation on the status of Arab women. She compares a pen to a scalpel. \"Words should not seek to please,\" she writes in A Daughter of Isis, the first part of her autobiography, adding that words \"should not hide the wounds in our bodies, the shameful moments in our lives.\" When she was six, she underwent a clitorectomy at the hands of a daya (midwife), who said it was the will of God. Nawal called for her mother to rescue her, only to find that she had been present all along. She later wrote a letter to God saying, \"I'm not ready to believe in you if you're not just.\" Everywhere she looked she saw \"double standards, contradictions and injustices.

With her husband, she boarded a plane for North Carolina in the United States. She watched Egypt from a distance and taught a course at Duke University about the experience - Dissidence and Creativity. Exile made her feel \"like a fish outside the sea\". She was homesick. \"Life became very dear,\" she says. \"I felt death was over my head like a big black cloud. So I wanted to write my life. I became very sensual. I loved food. I loved sex. That's how we survive.\" In the 80s she had become involved with British political campaigns: the miners' strike, Greenham common, sit-ins against NHS cuts, demonstrations against the National Front, CND.Her position as an eastern intellectual embraced by the west has led her work to be simultaneously used in the west to justify objections to Islam while in the east there are hopes that her writing will serve as an antidote to western misconceptions about Arab women as supine, veiled creatures in need of rescuing. \"She had a knowledge and critique of British feminism while British feminism didn't have a confident engagement with African or middle eastern feminism,\" says Beatrix Campbell. \"Here was a woman sustained by feminism and in an argument with it. And while defending her own society in an argument with it and ours.\" The arguments, when first expressed, were revelatory. It is not Islam, she argued, that oppressed women in the Arab Islamic countries, but the inability of Arab people to take control of their economic potential and resources. \"I have never separated women's liberation from the liberation of my country,\" she says. Economics, she argues shapes the standards and values of all religions. She rails against the prevalent conception of women's liberation as a western invention that has trickled to women in the east. Lives have been changed by El Saadawi. Marlyn Tadros first met her in 1988 at a book fair in Cairo. At the time Tadros was 28 and had worked as an air-hostess, but her husband had confiscated her passport. She had just read The Hidden Face Of Eve, El Saadawi's 1980 work on the status of women in Arab countries. \"It was only Nawal who said how I felt was unnatural,\" she says. \"When you live in a mainstream that tells you 'this is natural' it's extremely empowering to find someone out there who thinks differently.\" Tadros, now the senior director of programmes for a human rights organisation, after a stint as a visiting fellow at Harvard, cites this meeting as the beginning of her own activism. El Saadawi writes in The Hidden Face Of Eve: \"There are still so many thinkers . . . who wish to separate the arduous struggles of women for self-emancipation from the revolt of the people everywhere.\" What we share rather than what separates us interests her. She tells a story about how, when giving a lecture in the States, a woman in the audience asked: \"how do you explain why some Muslim women want to wear the veil?\" She relishes her reply: \"In the same way that I'd explain why you choose to wear make-up. Like make-up, it hides the face of women. They both show conformity to a culture's idea of what is feminine.\" Her analysis is a series of cultural and political dot-to-dots. \"I think clitorectomy is done to all women,\" she says. \"Be it physical, psychological, educational. When Freud said the clitoris is a male organ in a female body and clitoral orgasm is related to childhood he cut the clitoris psychologically because he abolished its function.\" Unusually for an Egyptian woman, El Saadawi has married three times; the first time, aged 24, to a fellow student two years her senior at medical school. Like her father, he was active in the anti-colonial struggle; a guerrilla fighter against the British military occupation of the Suez Canal. Nationalist sentiment and the humiliation of the Egyptian armed forces during the war against the newly independent state of Israel precipitated a coup, led by Mohammed Neguib in July 1952, in which the ruling King Farouk was deposed. When Neguib's political rival Gamal Abdel Nasser assumed power two years later, El Saadawi's first husband came out of hiding and returned to her. But he had become embittered and disturbed by his enforced self-exile and fled to upper Egypt, racked with depression. \"The depression added to his patriarchal tendencies,\" she says. \"I was a successful doctor. He tried to dominate me.\" The couple had a daughter, Mona, now 44, a writer and essayist living in Cairo. When El Saadawi's salary could no longer stretch to supporting her husband and their daughter, she turned to her father. He helped her get a divorce and she lived with her parents in Giza, a district of Cairo, until they died a couple of years later. Her second husband, a lawyer, hated being married to a woman who ruffled so many feathers, and they divorced within a year. \"I didn't love him very much but he said he'd accept my conditions. I needed a partner. A secret love affair would have ruined my career. The social pressure to be married was great.\" In 1964 she married Sherif Hetata, a doctor, writer and activist. They have a son, Araf, now 39, a film director, who lives in Cairo. Hetata is her English translator and companion. They are a beautiful, entertaining double act: \"I wanted to be with a political man,\" she says. \"That's not what you told me,\" he interrupts. \"You said you wanted to marry a man who'd been in prison.\" They met at the ministry of health, where he was setting up a rural health programme. He had just been released from a 14-year prison sentence for membership of a communist party that had criticised Nasser's regime. Hetata \"was sure of himself, thoughtful, calm and serious,\" she says. \"I felt I could trust him.\" El Saadawi has never belonged to a political party. \"I was never a Marxist, never a communist. Why should I belong to Marx, or Nasser or Sadat and abolish my name? Marx is a man who created a theory. We can all be philosophers. I was always just myself.\" It is an attitude that over the years has made her enemies and brought her criticism. Marlyn Tadros says El Saadawi is a pioneer \"but she's a very, very difficult person and I don't want to stay around her. She has to have everything her way. There's often only a semblance of democracy. Her self-confidence goes against her.\" Recognition for pioneering work, Tadros says, is particularly hard to come by in Egypt and the middle east, and so El Saadawi \"has to act up for it. She has been isolated by the women's movement in Egypt - other feminists have not included her in projects.\" Beatrix Campbell says British feminism \"deified\" El Saadawi. \"There's always a risk that black women are rarefied, exoticised and isolated. It's easier for the white world if there's only one different voice. It doesn't have to deal with the clamouring; all those things that different people have to say. El Saadawi moved very easily in a white woman's world. She was received as a lone star.\" It is a position that makes Yasmin Alibhai Brown, a commentator on race affairs, uncomfortable. \"There was something alarming about the way one woman's life was grabbed and used to simplify all Arab women's lives. She's from that final wave of colonialism where being a member of the international westernised elite was desirable. There are new kinds of writers now.\" El Saadawi's friend of 20 years, Haleh Afshar, professor of politics and women's studies at York University, says that El Saadawi has been bashed both ways. \"In the States she is often seen as an eastern intellectual exotic on the sidelines. She is no longer a prophet in her own land, and she wasn't one in the States.\" At the beginning of this year, after six years' exile in the United States, El Saadawi returned to Egypt to finish the third and final part of her autobiography. Mubarak's government, itself threatened by the extremist Islamic groups that wanted her dead, is now beginning to tackle them, she says. She feels safer. Part one of her memoir, covering the first 24 years of her life, is a sensuous recollection: the smell of her mother's skin, the pain in her growing bones. Back home in Egypt, other women have been slogging away to change the nitty-gritty details of areas such as the law, health and education to improve women's lives. They are not starry-eyed over El Saadawi. Hala Shukrallah, a member of the New Women Research Centre in Cairo, which campaigns, offers legal support and community-based projects for women's rights, is unequivocal about how El Saadawi's absence from grassroots activism in Egypt has diminished her significance there. \"She was important in the 70s but I don't think she's had an influence in the 90s,\" she says. \"She's not here. When you're not here and not struggling on the same level, you're out of it. She's been shaped by her audience and has directed her work to the west when she's there. That's natural.\" El Saadawi compares herself to a horse jumping over obstacles. \"When I clear one jump, the next is higher.\" She has set herself some tough hurdles. She was among a delegation of nine women to Baghdad a month before the expiry of the UN deadline and the outbreak of the Gulf war in 1991. She met the UN secretary-general in New York and toured the US for two weeks to rally support for peace and an Arab solution to the war. The initiative grew out of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association, the first pan-Arab organisation to be accorded international status at the UN, which El Saadawi founded to counter \"the isolation\" of writing. The government closed the Egyptian branch of the association later that year. She appeared at the 1985 United Nations women's conference in Nairobi, but did not attend the international debate in Beijing a decade later. Why not? \"I received an invitation,\" she says. \"But after the UN's intervention and collaboration with western powers in the Gulf war it became the United Nations of America for me: a tool in the hands of global capitalist powers. I'm wasting my time going. Women will never be liberated if the UN is involved.\" The world has not turned out in the way that El Saadawi once hoped. \"Those countries with global power bring barriers between countries so capital can flow more easily. They speak about diversity, freedom, multiculturalism, and divide people by religion and race in the name of post- modernism. We should be undoing the differences between us.\" Haleh Afshar detects a lament for lost opportunities in El Saadawi's autobiography. \"It's full of bitterness and sadness,\" she says. \"Nawal started in an era where modernity and progress meant that a young woman from a village could, as she did, become a government minister. You can't do that in Egypt today. There is less social mobility. She had a vision that didn't come good. It's so different from the exuberant, lively person she is.\" El Saadawi's journey between Cairo and the village is all the travelling she wants to do for now. She and Hetata have built a small house in his family village just north of hers in the middle of the delta. They go there two or three times a year to write and relax, she says. The village is \"typical - just fields, animals everywhere, small streets and children running around\". Every other year she will spend a month teaching at Florida Atlantic University. Dissidence and creativity will still be her subject. Next month she must submit the third and final part of her autobiography to her Egyptian publishers. More meetings are planned to discuss setting up an Egyptian women's union. El Saadawi hopes as always that links will form between the fragments. She's trying to find \"a charismatic woman\" to lead it. She's very busy with her writing these days. The movement needs someone less controversial, she says. Someone with a clean slate. \"I'm arguing,\" she says, \"that it may be better for the union to have a young woman leading it.\" Will she miss America? \"I miss teaching. It allows me to speak my mind but I was always going to be an alien there. I needed to be near my children, my village, my friends. I told Sherif that it's better to die here. But wherever I am I'm criticising the government. Now I feel at home in every country. I feel as if I belong to the world,\" she smiles. \"I don't belong to a certain place.\" Life at a glance Born: 1931 Kafr Tahal, Egypt.

The star of Alfie, The Italian Job, Get Carter and The Man Who Would Be King courted controversy when he was presented with a Bafta fellowship.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair offers middle England a Queen's birthday honour's list after its own heart today with awards for soap stars, sports heroes of all ages, best-selling novelists, successful headteachers - and virtually no politicians. Today's belated knighthood for the Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine and the designer Paul Smith, plus assorted gongs for the likes of pop veterans Lulu and Lonnie Donegan, writers JK \"Harry Potter\" Rowling and Colin Dexter, the creator of Inspector Morse, are unusually accompanied by not one peerage. Paddy Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader and ally of Tony Blair in centre-left realignment, gets one of 25 knighthoods, as do such pillars of the new establishment as the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, the City watchdog, Howard Davies, and the tenacious water regulator, Ian Byatt. But these honours among the 971 given - a record 40% of them to women - are partly overshadowed by awards to controversial businessmen, which surprised some Labour critics. Not only does the Tory party treasurer, Michael Ashcroft, cap his recent peerage with a knighthood, the KCMG, courtesy of the government of Belize, but the Barclay brothers, David and Frederick, also get knighthoods for services to charity. Famously secretive about their affairs, the fabulously wealthy Barclays have built themselves a fortress in the low-tax Channel Islands. But they are listed in today's Downing Street press release as resident in Monte Carlo. The latest Ashcroft honour was not one either Mr Blair or Buckingham Palace could reject, coming as it did from the Commonwealth government that his wealth and expertise benefited. A Labour MP, Peter Bradley, said: \"At the rate Ashcroft is going, he'll be a member of the royal family by Christmas.\" Mr Blair is leaving most peerages in future to the new appointments commission. His priority this summer has been to reward people doing good jobs in health and education, with 11 new knights and dameships between them. The arts patron Vivien Duffield, a pillar of the Royal Opera House, becomes Dame Vivien. More surprisingly, so does the feisty novelist Beryl Bainbridge. Another new dame is Mary Peters, an Olympic pentathlon gold medallist, like Jim Fox who gets an OBE. The golfer Paul Lawrie, who won the Open, and rugby's Jeremy Guscott get MBEs, as does Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler in EastEnders) and Liz Dawn, who is not only Coronation Street's gossipy Vera Duckworth but the campaigning mayoress of Leeds. Carol Vorderman, said to be the highest-paid woman on television, is awarded an MBE, while the distinguished Welsh actor Sian Phillips gets a CBE, the same award as Sam Mendes of the Donmar Warehouse, fresh from his Oscar for American Beauty. CBEs also go to Michael Parkinson, the great survivor of the chatshow sofa, and Elizabeth Jane Howard, novelist ex-wife of Kingsley Amis and patient stepmother to Martin. Now 77, she has been writing books since she was nine. Lulu, who had her first No 1 at 19, gets an OBE, as does the ex-footballer Jimmy Armfield, capped 43 times for England. In another sentimental gesture to a bygone era, an MBE goes to Sidney Wooderson, 86, a legendary miler in his time.

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow a group of nearly 150 people will embark onto vessels of the British and French navies and take a trip into the Bay of Biscay off St Nazaire on the west coast of France. There they will remember the victims of the worst British maritime disaster of the second world war. The SS Lancastria was sunk on June 17 1940 while lying at anchor five miles off St Nazaire. There were fewer than 2,500 survivors from a total of around 6,000 passengers. This was part of Operation Aerial, a desperate attempt by the British to evacuate more than 150,000 men from western France two weeks after the Dunkirk Operation Dynamo had ended.</p> <p>The story of the Lancastria is one of the worst kept secrets of the war. Churchill slapped a D-notice on the press, fearful that the huge loss of life would damage morale. This was understandable, as British forces had been pushed out of Norway, Dunkirk, then the west of France. The French had surrendered and everyone expected a German land invasion.</p> <p>However, the New York Press published a report, so the British press thought it was freed of the D-notice and stories appeared in most newspapers around July 26. The D-notice and the fact that many returning survivors were told they must not speak about the incident to anyone created an illusion of secrecy. Some survivors believe that information on the sinking is still withheld, closed until 2040 under the Official Secrets Act. The public records office and admiralty deny this.</p> <p>The known facts are harrowing enough. Continuing advances by the German army had broken through the French 10th army, and Lt Gen Alan Brooke, who took command of the British Expeditionary Force only on the morning of June 13, proposed plans for the complete evacuation of Britain's remaining forces.</p> <p>The SS Lancastria, which had been involved in the evacuation of troops from Norway, was sent from Liverpool on June 14 and arrived off St Nazaire on June 17. Between 8am and noon, more than 5,200 troops and civilian refugees boarded it.</p> <p>Reg Brown, who was with the 633 Artisan Work Company (Royal Engineers), said: \"We got on board at 3pm. I was filthy dirty and hungry. I headed below for a wash, but the food smelled good so I decided to eat instead. I had just sat down to eat when there was an almighty bang and the boat rocked like a cradle. The ceiling came down.\"</p> <p>The enemy attack that interrupted Reg Brown's meal took place at about 3.45pm. Four high-explosive bombs hit the ship simultaneously. One went down the funnel, exploding in the engine room. Another crashed through the hatch of No 2 hold, where 800 RAF personnel had been sent. The others smashed through the hatches of Nos 3 and 4 holds.</p> <p>Listing steeply to starboard and sinking at the bows, the Lancastria took only 20 minutes to go down. Many soldiers who could not swim stayed on the ship until the last moment. They were singing Roll Out the Barrel and Rule, Britannia. About 1,400 tons of fuel oil was released. It was to prove more lethal than enemy machine gun fire to many of the Lancastria's passengers.</p> <p>Other ships involved in the evacuation moved in to help rescue survivors. An armed trawler, the Cambridgeshire, picked up 900. HMS Oronsay, itself hit in an earlier enemy air attack, moved in to help. Private Jesse Fenton from Nottingham was with the Sherwood Foresters. \"I was picked up after about two hours in the water by a French soldier and his father who had put out in a fishing boat from the shore.\"</p> <p>The Lancastria was overloaded: a liner, its usual complement, including a crew of 350, was 2,180. There was no time for survival drills and many soldiers died as lifejackets bounced up when they hit the water, breaking their necks. Others drowned, there being insufficient lifeboats or jackets. More perished in the burning fuel oil, probably set alight by calcium flares detached from lifeboats, although there were claims that the Germans dropped incendiary bombs onto the floating oil.</p> <p><b> Exhausted</b><br> Several survivors reported being machine-gunned by aircraft in the water. Reg Brown said: \"I was in the water for about three hours before being picked up by a French minesweeper. I could feel the vibration in the water as the bullets hit.\" Capt WG Euston, skipper of the armed trawler HMT Cambridgeshire, the first boat on the scene, recommended several of his crew for awards, including Stanley Ringett for \"making repeated journeys in a lifeboat to pick up exhausted men from the water while under machine-gun fire from enemy planes\", and William Perrin for \"keeping up continuous machine-gun fire in an attempt to prevent enemy planes machine-gunning men in the water.\"</p> <p>Brooke knew little of the Lancastria sinking, but he must have been unsurprised that such a disaster had occurred.

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow a group of nearly 150 people will embark onto vessels of the British and French navies and take a trip into the Bay of Biscay off St Nazaire on the west coast of France. There they will remember the victims of the worst British maritime disaster of the second world war. The SS Lancastria was sunk on June 17 1940 while lying at anchor five miles off St Nazaire. There were fewer than 2,500 survivors from a total of around 6,000 passengers. This was part of Operation Aerial, a desperate attempt by the British to evacuate more than 150,000 men from western France two weeks after the Dunkirk Operation Dynamo had ended. The story of the Lancastria is one of the worst kept secrets of the war. Churchill slapped a D-notice on the press, fearful that the huge loss of life would damage morale. This was understandable, as British forces had been pushed out of Norway, Dunkirk, then the west of France. The French had surrendered and everyone expected a German land invasion. However, the New York Press published a report, so the British press thought it was freed of the D-notice and stories appeared in most newspapers around July 26. The D-notice and the fact that many returning survivors were told they must not speak about the incident to anyone created an illusion of secrecy. Some survivors believe that information on the sinking is still withheld, closed until 2040 under the Official Secrets Act. The public records office and admiralty deny this. The known facts are harrowing enough. Continuing advances by the German army had broken through the French 10th army, and Lt Gen Alan Brooke, who took command of the British Expeditionary Force only on the morning of June 13, proposed plans for the complete evacuation of Britain's remaining forces. The SS Lancastria, which had been involved in the evacuation of troops from Norway, was sent from Liverpool on June 14 and arrived off St Nazaire on June 17. Between 8am and noon, more than 5,200 troops and civilian refugees boarded it. Reg Brown, who was with the 633 Artisan Work Company (Royal Engineers), said: \"We got on board at 3pm. I was filthy dirty and hungry. I headed below for a wash, but the food smelled good so I decided to eat instead. I had just sat down to eat when there was an almighty bang and the boat rocked like a cradle. The ceiling came down.\" The enemy attack that interrupted Reg Brown's meal took place at about 3.45pm. Four high-explosive bombs hit the ship simultaneously. One went down the funnel, exploding in the engine room. Another crashed through the hatch of No 2 hold, where 800 RAF personnel had been sent. The others smashed through the hatches of Nos 3 and 4 holds. Listing steeply to starboard and sinking at the bows, the Lancastria took only 20 minutes to go down. Many soldiers who could not swim stayed on the ship until the last moment. They were singing Roll Out the Barrel and Rule, Britannia. About 1,400 tons of fuel oil was released. It was to prove more lethal than enemy machine gun fire to many of the Lancastria's passengers. Other ships involved in the evacuation moved in to help rescue survivors. An armed trawler, the Cambridgeshire, picked up 900. HMS Oronsay, itself hit in an earlier enemy air attack, moved in to help. Private Jesse Fenton from Nottingham was with the Sherwood Foresters. \"I was picked up after about two hours in the water by a French soldier and his father who had put out in a fishing boat from the shore.\" The Lancastria was overloaded: a liner, its usual complement, including a crew of 350, was 2,180. There was no time for survival drills and many soldiers died as lifejackets bounced up when they hit the water, breaking their necks. Others drowned, there being insufficient lifeboats or jackets. More perished in the burning fuel oil, probably set alight by calcium flares detached from lifeboats, although there were claims that the Germans dropped incendiary bombs onto the floating oil. Exhausted Several survivors reported being machine-gunned by aircraft in the water. Reg Brown said: \"I was in the water for about three hours before being picked up by a French minesweeper. I could feel the vibration in the water as the bullets hit.\" Capt WG Euston, skipper of the armed trawler HMT Cambridgeshire, the first boat on the scene, recommended several of his crew for awards, including Stanley Ringett for \"making repeated journeys in a lifeboat to pick up exhausted men from the water while under machine-gun fire from enemy planes\", and William Perrin for \"keeping up continuous machine-gun fire in an attempt to prevent enemy planes machine-gunning men in the water.\" Brooke knew little of the Lancastria sinking, but he must have been unsurprised that such a disaster had occurred. For five days he had been involved in a merry-go-round of politics and regulations. Once he had learned that the French 10th Army was unable to continue organised resistance, he contacted Churchill and the chief of the imperial general staff, Gen Sir John Dill, recommending first that Canadian troops newly arrived in Brest be re-embarked and withdrawn to England, and that the other fighting units retreat towards Cherbourg to evacuate. He also sought to set in train the removal of stores and equipment, plus men, from west coast ports including St Nazaire and La Rochelle. He was thwarted, first by an amazing scheme, that the combined French and British forces should retreat into Brittany and hold a line roughly between Mont St Michel and Nantes. Churchill only learned of the plan - described by one French general as \"idiotic\" - from Brooke, who both agreed it was impractical and that it be abandoned. Unfortunately, no one told the French and politics took over, as some British troops were forced to remain fighting alongside the French to placate them. At least a day was lost, with troops preparing to embark at Cherbourg then awaiting further orders. Despite the fact that the French armies had disintegrated, and P\u00e9tain was preparing to seek an armistice with the Germans, Churchill still wanted to save face with the French. Brooke was walking a tightrope, trying to prepare for evacuation, but with no orders to do so. There is no doubt that the delays by Churchill, which stopped the BEF evacuating earlier, created the bottleneck at St Nazaire. If troops had been evacuated from Cherbourg and Brest ear lier, more ships would have been free to evacuate St Nazaire.

Knutsford's existing shareholders, who number about 1,000, are to be given the chance to take advantage of a 10 for one bonus issue of 10p shares, which Mr Wakeham believes will compensate investors who bought in during the share price's heady days when it traded in excess of 200p. \"It's the right and proper thing to be doing and something we would probably have done anyway,\" Mr Wakeham said. \"Our business will in the future rely on retail investors.\" The shares, which were suspended last month at 80p, are not expected to start trading again before July 18.",

The naturally bubbling water from Vergeze's spring had been known from Roman times for its alleged health giving properties. </p> <p>Harmsworth, brother of British press magnate Lord Harmsworth, wanted to bottle it so it could be sent to friends to drink with their whisky. He soon realised its commercial potential and bought control of the spring. </p> <p>Harmsworth named his new venture after Louis Perrier, the doctor who introduced him to the sparkling water and from whom he bought the source. The distinctive green glass bottles were designed to resemble the indian clubs which Perrier advised Harmsworth to swing for exercise. </p> <p>The business grew rapidly. Harmsworth, with his family background, used the power of advertising. He marketed Perrier under the slogan \"the champagne of table waters\". </p> <p>By 1922, his company was producing 6m bottles a year. By 1933, when Harmsworth died, the annual output had risen to 18m bottles. Perrier became a favourite with the English aristocracy. It received royal warrants from Edward VII and George V. </p> <p>Perrier disappeared from the British market during the 1930s and 1940s, and, at the end of the second world war, the Harmsworth family sold the business to a group of French businessmen led by Georges Leven. </p> <p>Perrier flourished under new ownership, with inspired marketing and promotions. Leading poster artists and copywriters were commissioned. In 1969 a full page colour advertisement by Salvador Dali appeared in French newspapers. </p> <p>By 1984 Perrier was the world's leading mineral water company. It dominated the British market, with sales rising from 30m litres a year in 1980 to 420m by 1990. This year it will be the official mineral water at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. </p> <p>Disaster struck in 1990 when routine testing in the US found traces of benzene in 12 bottles of Perrier. The company mishandled the situation. It initially withdrew 72m bottles from the US market, but tried to bluff it out in the rest of the world, claiming the benzene levels were not dangerous. At first it blamed the problem on a cleaner's dirty rag, but later admitted that gas filters at the bottling plant had not been changed. </p> <p>Public pressure and threats of legal action forced the destruction of 280m bottles worldwide - up to five months' stock. In Britain, Perrier drinkers found an alternative as Scottish producers broke into the market in a big way. In the US, Perrier was never to regain its position as market leader. Today it ranks 22nd, according to specialist consultancy Zenith International. </p> <p>The affair heralded the end for Perrier as an independent company. In 1992 it was taken over by Nestl\u00e9, the Swiss food and drinks group. </p> <p>Nestl\u00e9's Perrier-Vittel division is now the world's largest bottled water company, owning 55 brands including Buxton mineral water. But Perrier, the brand created by St John Harmsworth, remains its flagship product.</p>",

The distinctive green glass bottles were designed to resemble the indian clubs which Perrier advised Harmsworth to swing for exercise. The business grew rapidly. Harmsworth, with his family background, used the power of advertising. He marketed Perrier under the slogan \"the champagne of table waters\". By 1922, his company was producing 6m bottles a year. By 1933, when Harmsworth died, the annual output had risen to 18m bottles. Perrier became a favourite with the English aristocracy. It received royal warrants from Edward VII and George V. Perrier disappeared from the British market during the 1930s and 1940s, and, at the end of the second world war, the Harmsworth family sold the business to a group of French businessmen led by Georges Leven. Perrier flourished under new ownership, with inspired marketing and promotions. Leading poster artists and copywriters were commissioned. In 1969 a full page colour advertisement by Salvador Dali appeared in French newspapers. By 1984 Perrier was the world's leading mineral water company. It dominated the British market, with sales rising from 30m litres a year in 1980 to 420m by 1990. This year it will be the official mineral water at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Disaster struck in 1990 when routine testing in the US found traces of benzene in 12 bottles of Perrier. The company mishandled the situation. It initially withdrew 72m bottles from the US market, but tried to bluff it out in the rest of the world, claiming the benzene levels were not dangerous. At first it blamed the problem on a cleaner's dirty rag, but later admitted that gas filters at the bottling plant had not been changed. Public pressure and threats of legal action forced the destruction of 280m bottles worldwide - up to five months' stock. In Britain, Perrier drinkers found an alternative as Scottish producers broke into the market in a big way. In the US, Perrier was never to regain its position as market leader. Today it ranks 22nd, according to specialist consultancy Zenith International. The affair heralded the end for Perrier as an independent company. In 1992 it was taken over by Nestl\u00e9, the Swiss food and drinks group. Nestl\u00e9's Perrier-Vittel division is now the world's largest bottled water company, owning 55 brands including Buxton mineral water. But Perrier, the brand created by St John Harmsworth, remains its flagship product.",

      "body": "<p>Financial markets worldwide are deep in a midsummer slumber. Trading volumes are low. Economic news comes and goes, barely attracting a glance. It is tempting to assume this catatonia will last through to September. But having bedded down early, it would take little to spark investors to life earlier than that. </p> <p>There is much talk at City summer parties of the lack of liquidity in stock markets. Three anecdotes from my week: One fund manager complained that he's finding it impossible to invest the cash that has built up in his portfolio. There are just no sellers of the stocks he wants to buy - UK technology companies, for the record. </p> <p>A trader - with no suggestion of clumsy dealing on his part - cited his $50,000 buy order for a major Nasdaq stock that moved the company's share price by a mighty 5%. And the market was falling at the time. </p> <p>Finally, a dealer at a major City investment house feared terminal boredom. His dealing pad, normally full of instructions from his fund manager colleagues, was simply bare. </p> <p>These tales are typical of the experience of most market participants. It is not a lack of available liquidity that is the problem, though. It is the collective unwillingness of investors to deploy it in the markets. </p> <p>The trauma of spring's collapse in technology stocks has jammed the thought processes of the fund management groups. Too late to sell? Time to reinvest? Or time to head for the beach? </p> <p>At times such as these it is wise to take the opportunity afforded by collective inactivity to reassess one's basic interpretation of the investment environment. Do it on the beach by all means. But don't neglect to do it at all. </p> <p>Start first with the economic and interest rate cycles. This year began with the economic temperature high. The US economy appeared impervious to the Federal Reserve's attempts to turn down the heat. Europe's recovery trundled on. Even Japan's stuttering economy was once again in forward gear. Interest rates, unsurprisingly, were on the up in the west. </p> <p>As rates have risen, however, they've begun to reshape the world's economies. Only this week the US Beige Book confirmed a gradual cooling of the economy. The euro is at last responding to higher European rates. British inflation pressures are waning. </p> <p>Each of these is a positive sign for bond and equity markets. Both can live with rising interest rates so long as their likely ceiling is visible.

      "bodyText": "Financial markets worldwide are deep in a midsummer slumber. Trading volumes are low. Economic news comes and goes, barely attracting a glance. It is tempting to assume this catatonia will last through to September. But having bedded down early, it would take little to spark investors to life earlier than that. There is much talk at City summer parties of the lack of liquidity in stock markets. Three anecdotes from my week: One fund manager complained that he's finding it impossible to invest the cash that has built up in his portfolio. There are just no sellers of the stocks he wants to buy - UK technology companies, for the record. A trader - with no suggestion of clumsy dealing on his part - cited his $50,000 buy order for a major Nasdaq stock that moved the company's share price by a mighty 5%. And the market was falling at the time. Finally, a dealer at a major City investment house feared terminal boredom. His dealing pad, normally full of instructions from his fund manager colleagues, was simply bare. These tales are typical of the experience of most market participants. It is not a lack of available liquidity that is the problem, though. It is the collective unwillingness of investors to deploy it in the markets. The trauma of spring's collapse in technology stocks has jammed the thought processes of the fund management groups. Too late to sell? Time to reinvest? Or time to head for the beach? At times such as these it is wise to take the opportunity afforded by collective inactivity to reassess one's basic interpretation of the investment environment. Do it on the beach by all means. But don't neglect to do it at all. Start first with the economic and interest rate cycles. This year began with the economic temperature high. The US economy appeared impervious to the Federal Reserve's attempts to turn down the heat. Europe's recovery trundled on. Even Japan's stuttering economy was once again in forward gear. Interest rates, unsurprisingly, were on the up in the west. As rates have risen, however, they've begun to reshape the world's economies. Only this week the US Beige Book confirmed a gradual cooling of the economy. The euro is at last responding to higher European rates. British inflation pressures are waning. Each of these is a positive sign for bond and equity markets. Both can live with rising interest rates so long as their likely ceiling is visible. Through the early months of 2000 this was not the case. Now it is possible that British rates are at their peak, US rates have half a percent or less to rise, and euro rates perhaps only a percent or so. As the summer progresses, with further evidence of the lagged impact of past rate tightening, so bond investors will begin to speculate about the timing of the eventual downswing in the cost of money. Such a shift in economic and investment debate should unjam the bond markets, which have traded in a very narrow range this year. If you are looking for a key indicator, focus on 10-year US bonds, currently yielding 6.05%. A decisive break below 6% would signal a major improvement in sentiment. Equity markets traditionally take their lead from bonds. Falling yields are a good thing. But one can have too much of a good thing. When falling yields reflect waning inflation pressure, and likely lower official interest rates, it is fine for equities. When they spell impending inflation, that is altogether different. Now, there is no prospect of economic growth falling materially below its long term rate. Equities can therefore expect to celebrate the positive impact of lower bond yields on the valuation of future corporate profits. My favourite gauge of the relationship between bonds and equities is the prospective bond equity earnings yield, or BEER. This essentially compares the valuation of future company profits with gilt yields. The lower the BEER, the cheaper are equities relative to bonds. Over the very long run in the US market the BEER has tended to oscillate around a level of 1.0.

      "bodyText": "Billionaire financier George Soros, reeling from his funds' losses in technology stocks, said yesterday that new economy stocks remained overvalued and the market chaotic. The comments were a further blow to the hi-tech sector which has weathered the sharp falls and, recently, dramatic rises in indices like Nasdaq. \"I think that the markets have become somewhat chaotic and very few people have been able to make money,\" Mr Soros said on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. \"In my opinion, they [technology stocks] are overvalued. There has been a fantastic boom followed by an initial crash. I think there is a long period of drying out to come.\" Mr Soros, an elder statesman of the investment world and chairman of Soros Fund Management, recently restructured his firm's flagship Quantum Fund to pursue a less risky investment strategy, stating that he would prefer returns of about 15% rather than 31% if it meant stability. Additionally $4.5bn of Soros funds are expected to invested in real estate and private equity, where Mr Soros's son Robert has a keen interest. Robert Soros is to take a bigger management role in the family business. Mr Soros, 70, said his conservative stance towards technology shares was also prompted by his desire to have an organisation that outlived him.",

      "bodyText": "For over a week now, there have been no fresh pictures of the 21 hostages on the Philippine island of Jolo - not since 11 European journalists bribed their way into the captors' encampment and were forced to pay $25,000 (\u00a316,500) more to ransom themselves out. But the word reaching intermediaries trying to resolve the two-month-old standoff is that the captives continue to discover new depths of despair, trapped hellishly between boredom and terror. Two of them, Renate Wallert of Germany and Stephane Loisy of France, have fallen into a \"very serious condition\", according to what the Abu Sayyaf rebels who took them hostage have told Philippine authorities. The hostage takers want swift resumption of negotiations on their $20m demand for the captives' release. The episode began when the heavily armed Islamic insurgents kidnapped Ms Wallert, her husband Werner and their son Marc together with 10 Malaysians, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a Filipina and a Lebanese from a remote Malaysian resort island on Easter Sunday. They were then taken by boat to the southern Philippines guerrilla stronghold. \"We must accept the reality that this isn't going to be resolved quickly,\" a Philippine government spokesman said. Germany's foreign minister Joschka Fischer talked to his counterparts from France and Finland this week to try to work out a common position to present to the Manila administration. The three states signalled their opposition to any direct action, such as a commando raid, to free the hostages. The German news reports from the camp captured the despondency of the hostages, many in the same clothes they wore when they were seized eight weeks ago and deprived of decent food, enough water and anything to read aside from rebel propaganda. The hostages have since been separated into two groups and moved from a reed hut to an open camp elsewhere on the island, German government officials in Berlin have been told. \"We are evermore uncertain if we'll ever get out of here,\" Ms Wallert, who was in a condition near to hysteria, told the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel. She suffers from a circulation disorder that makes it difficult for her to walk. \"We are dying here, and there's nothing you can do.\"",

How am I to survive here?\" he asked. A group of people with leprosy who fled the Stucco Catholic hospital in Makeni has still not turned up. Mile 91 itself is hardly secure. The rebels attacked the town a month ago, and RUF fighters are moving about 10 miles away burning villages. The United Nations says it has no intention of moving the refugees even though they could find themselves in the middle of a battle. While the government is claiming the RUF is on the run, its own forces are looking increasingly factionalised just one day after the British completed the withdrawal of their combat troops, whose intervention last month stopped a rebel push to take Freetown. In the shaky pro-government alliance, Kamajor militiamen clashed with soldiers loyal to the former military ruler, Johnny Paul Koroma; one of the more colourful factions calling itself the West Side Boys opened fire on members of the government's army in the frontline town of Lunsar. At least the government appears to be winning the psychological war. On the leaflet warning the RUF and Makeni's residents of a pending attack is a copy of a $500 note and a picture of a man with his arms hacked off. The rebels get the money, the caption notes, while innocent civilians are mutilated by them. \"That is true,\" said Mrs Konneh. \"If we are lucky they only steal our clothes and our food but it is just as easy for them to steal our lives.\"",

The Mississippi supreme court ruled that Claud Johnson, 68, of Crystal Springs, is the blues musician's sole heir and therefore entitled to about $1m (\u00a3660,000) in royalties. Johnson, a primary influence on popular music and whose numbers have been covered by legends such as Muddy Waters, the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, is thought to have died in 1938 at the age of 27, possibly poisoned by a jealous lover.

      "body": "<p>On an island in the middle of the river Frome in Somerset, Lynne Curry and Martin Whitfield have lived like derelicts for 13 months. Stuck without a bathroom or running water for eight weeks, they were reduced to taking showers at a local leisure centre.</p> <p>Yet they are very, very happy, and, in their own words, on a mission to create the perfect life. They are part of a band of intrepid homeowners who have set about overhauling tumbledown buildings in a bid to create unique and interesting homes.</p> <p>The couple are in the process of converting two grade II listed former animal feed mills that sit on an island in the middle of the town. They hope to live in one mill once it is completed, work in the adjoining buildings and run a bed and breakfast from the second.</p> <p>Homebuyers' enthusiasm for converting everything from old pubs to signal boxes shows no sign of waning. In the 70s, idealistic souls in search of the Good Life, scrambled to convert disused agricultural buildings such as barns. More recently, loft dwellers have rushed to buy homes in factories and warehouses. The closure of rural pubs, banks, churches, and schools has also resulted in a wide range of interesting buildings coming on the market.</p> <p>The Ecology Building Society counts a signal box and cemetery gate building among properties purchased with the help of one of their mortgages. \"We try to be a flexible lender and help fund renovation or conversions if the building is no longer used for its original purpose,\" says spokesman George Penaluna.</p> <p>Buyers who want to change a building's use need to apply for planning permission. Some older buildings will be sold with planning permission thrown in. If not, check with the local authority how the land lies before making an offer. But there is much more to converting older buildings than sticking in an Aga stove and mezzanine floor, warns Stephen Boniface, a surveyor who specialises in historic buildings.</p> <p>Mr Boniface says he has seen an alarming number of \"atrocious\" conversions. \"It depends on whose funding it is and the attitude of the builder or developer. If they can't see the profit margin in making the effort you can get a poor job,\" he says.</p> <p>For Lynne Curry, making a profit on the project is the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, she says they're not even sure whether they will recover the costs of the refurbishment, an estimated \u00a3300,000. The property cost the couple \u00a3100,000 and the purchase was financed with the help of a \u00a370,000 loan from the Ecology Building Society.</p> <p>\"We are not attempting to recreate the Mill on the Floss,\" she says firmly. \"We want to create a perfect lifestyle but this is not a rural idyll, this is an industrial town and there are things like electricity stations nearby.\"</p> <p>Ms Curry says the project is driven by their ideology. Her husband's company publishes city cycling maps and they run a car-less business. There's no car parking at the site and visitors have to cross a footbridge to get to the island. The building will be environmentally friendly, using the watermill to generate electricity. Ms Curry praises the architects, Bruges Tozer of Bristol and local builder KFG House, both essential to the smooth running of the project.</p> <p>But not everyone is so lucky.

      "bodyText": "On an island in the middle of the river Frome in Somerset, Lynne Curry and Martin Whitfield have lived like derelicts for 13 months. Stuck without a bathroom or running water for eight weeks, they were reduced to taking showers at a local leisure centre. Yet they are very, very happy, and, in their own words, on a mission to create the perfect life. They are part of a band of intrepid homeowners who have set about overhauling tumbledown buildings in a bid to create unique and interesting homes. The couple are in the process of converting two grade II listed former animal feed mills that sit on an island in the middle of the town. They hope to live in one mill once it is completed, work in the adjoining buildings and run a bed and breakfast from the second. Homebuyers' enthusiasm for converting everything from old pubs to signal boxes shows no sign of waning. In the 70s, idealistic souls in search of the Good Life, scrambled to convert disused agricultural buildings such as barns. More recently, loft dwellers have rushed to buy homes in factories and warehouses. The closure of rural pubs, banks, churches, and schools has also resulted in a wide range of interesting buildings coming on the market. The Ecology Building Society counts a signal box and cemetery gate building among properties purchased with the help of one of their mortgages. \"We try to be a flexible lender and help fund renovation or conversions if the building is no longer used for its original purpose,\" says spokesman George Penaluna. Buyers who want to change a building's use need to apply for planning permission. Some older buildings will be sold with planning permission thrown in. If not, check with the local authority how the land lies before making an offer. But there is much more to converting older buildings than sticking in an Aga stove and mezzanine floor, warns Stephen Boniface, a surveyor who specialises in historic buildings. Mr Boniface says he has seen an alarming number of \"atrocious\" conversions. \"It depends on whose funding it is and the attitude of the builder or developer. If they can't see the profit margin in making the effort you can get a poor job,\" he says. For Lynne Curry, making a profit on the project is the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, she says they're not even sure whether they will recover the costs of the refurbishment, an estimated \u00a3300,000. The property cost the couple \u00a3100,000 and the purchase was financed with the help of a \u00a370,000 loan from the Ecology Building Society. \"We are not attempting to recreate the Mill on the Floss,\" she says firmly. \"We want to create a perfect lifestyle but this is not a rural idyll, this is an industrial town and there are things like electricity stations nearby.\" Ms Curry says the project is driven by their ideology. Her husband's company publishes city cycling maps and they run a car-less business. There's no car parking at the site and visitors have to cross a footbridge to get to the island. The building will be environmentally friendly, using the watermill to generate electricity. Ms Curry praises the architects, Bruges Tozer of Bristol and local builder KFG House, both essential to the smooth running of the project. But not everyone is so lucky. Mr Boniface says too many builders and developers don't understand the construction of older buildings and make the mistake of applying modern solutions to properties constructed very differently. I'm dealing with a brick-built Tudor barn that has been converted to residential use and they're having damp problems. I can solve them for the time being but I know they're going to reappear a few years down the line. The problem has been caused by their failure to understand the sort of building they're dealing with.\" Although listed buildings are governed by restrictions, this is no guarantee that the job will be done properly, he says. \"Listing does place restrictions but once you've passed the aesthetic or technical minimum standard it can be hit-and-miss whether the job is a good one.\" Robin Chatwin, of the Wandsworth branch of FPD Savills, says buyers get very excited about living in a building that had a former life. An old courthouse in Clapham Old Town, London, has attracted a lot of interest. Buyers willing to take on a conversion can earn a premium when it comes to selling, says Mr Chatwin. FPD Savills is handling a former electrical distributors' warehouse in Shelgate Road, SW11.

Without it the police could arrest me for fraud and tax evasion within 200 metres of the cafe. Emerging from the counter, Lucia hands over my prize. She shakes my hand, grins and wishes good health. It is her way of forgiving me for the magazine. All the staff bid farewell. Infuriating, baffling and generous, such is Rome. The state says it is busy trying to slash the red tape that strangles the economy and, according to a recent survey, is the single biggest deterrent to foreign investment. Rules, procedures and systems that serve no purpose sprout everywhere: it is a cliche and very, very true. Romans are supposed to be chaotic yet they submit to the endless queues and most social restrictions, probably because they created them. They try to make up for it in many ways. They vow to reform, turn on the charm. Compensation comes in many guises, including red wrapping paper, ribbon and bow.",

Irwin Meister, one of two men who set up the Mebo electronics company in 1972, said the rush order was received in November 1988. By then the firm had been doing business with the Libyans for years, supplying communications equipment and 20 of its own-design MST-13 electronic timers. But Mr Meister told the court that when the order for more timers came in before Christmas 1988, Mebo did not have the right materials to produce its own type in time. Instead it bought Olympus timers for delivery to Libya by Mr Meister's business partner, Edwin Bollier. The court heard that Mr Bollier brought the timers back to Zurich the night before the Lockerbie bombing because the Libyans had rejected them as unsuitable. At the time they were left on a shelf. But then in January 1989, he looked at them again. Mr Meister said: \"Mr Bollier called me and said: 'Look what I've discovered'. He had one of the Olympus timers in his hand. He asked me to look at it - it was programmed for 7.30pm and the day of the week was a Wednesday.\" The Lockerbie explosion occurred shortly after 7pm on Wednesday December 21 1988. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 48, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44, deny charges of murder, conspiracy and breaching an aviation security act. The court has already heard that a tape recorder packed with Semtex attached to an MST-13 timer was placed in a suitcase on a Frankfurt-bound flight from Luqa airport, Malta. From there it was put on PanAm Flight 103 to Heathrow, exploding on the plane's next leg, from Heathrow to New York, above Lockerbie. Mr Meister, 62, had told Alan Turnbull QC, prosecuting, that Mebo first established commercial contacts with the Libyan army in about 1980. He said it was not like doing business with army purchasing offices in the west. They were passed from one contact to another, and his contacts were sometimes in uniform and sometimes in civilian clothes. Mr Meister named his contacts as Ezzadin Hinshiri and Said Rashid - both identified in the Lockerbie indictment as a link between Mebo and the two accused men.

Every small sheep pasture, each woody corner, was decked with white ribbons of blossom, underlined with more brilliance where blooming cow parsley swayed in the breeze. May and early June is a white time. All the way along its course from Llyn Tegid, the Dee traverses country shining now in pale and pristine garb. We looked up the valley towards Corwen; green and packed, it seemed, with burgeoning nature and quite unchanged (when seen from our rocktop eyrie) since the days when George Borrow found the vale so attractive.

      "bodyText": "Laura Kane was on her local authority's child protection register when she was raped and murdered by a trusted family friend, Sunderland city council admitted yesterday. The nine-year-old's six siblings - several of whom are also believed to have been on the register - are now all in care. Last night the authority admitted that a multi-agency review of her death - standard practice after a child on the register dies - had identified failings in the system and \"lessons to be learned\". But it could not pledge these lessons would be made public and stressed: \"No procedure could have anticipated the brutal murder of a child by a family friend.\" Laura, of Penshaw Village, on the outskirts of Sutherland, was raped and murdered in August last year by Colin Bainbridge, a 35-year-old handyman who was a close friend of her mother, Carol. Newcastle crown court was told Bainbridge had gained the trust of Mrs Kane by doing repair work for her, and even took her for a drink hours after killing her daughter and burying her under the floorboards of his home in Murton, Co Durham. He is to be sentenced on Monday after the trial judge said the case was one in which he would have to consider setting a recommendation of the time to be served before being considered for release. Yesterday Laura's mother, who is separated from her husband, refused to discuss her daughter's \"at-risk\" status, claiming she was gagged after having spoken to a Sunday tabloid. But a council spokesman said: \"We can confirm that Laura Kane was on the child protection register and that the surviving siblings are in care. But we are not prepared to discuss confidential information about Laura or her siblings.\" An injunction, forbidding information about her siblings being published, was still in force, he added. Following the youngster's murder, a \"rigorous and comprehensive\" review into whether she could have been better protected had been carried out by an independent expert from the Sunderland area child protection committee, a multi-agency body, the council spokesman said. And he admitted: \"The review does identify lessons to be learned and ways in which work to safeguard children can be improved. At the next meeting in July, the ACPC will give serious consideration to the next steps and to making public details of the review process and its recommendations - something which could not be done while criminal proceedings were in progress.\" But he stressed that the decision to release such recommendations was purely at the body's discretion, and that it was unlikely to divulge specific details of Laura's case. As Sunderland social services department pledged to \"look very carefully at its own child protection practices\", pressure mounted for the review findings to be made public. \"It is really quite difficult to know whether our social services department is fulfilling all its obligations,\" said Margaret Forbes, leader of the Tories on Sunderland city council. She added: \"I would like to have an inquiry on what went on. That is some way of establishing accountability.\" And health campaigners questioned whether the local authority could have done more to safeguard the girl. \"Surely they should have been alerted to the fact that Laura apparently liked playing games where she was tied up?\" asked Chris Close, of the charity Action in Mental Health. \"That is abnormal behaviour which would have surely sent alarm bells ringing.\"",

The 30-bed Ayurvedic charitable hospital will open on July 1 in temporary premises in Hammersmith before moving to its permanent residence in central London. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian treatment system that has recently become fashionable. The hospital's backers hope to eschew this glamorous image and demonstrate that Ayurveda is a serious practice that can cure illnesses where conventional medicine fails. A holistic system, involving meditation, diet, exercise, massage, and herbal cures, Ayurveda - the name is derived from the Sanskrit for knowledge of life - is offered in Britain by around 50 qualified practitioners who are monitored by the Ayurvedic Medical Association UK.

After fending off a legal challenge from anti-rape campaigners, speculation about his mental health and the fatal shooting of a close friend, Tyson will arrive in Britain on Sunday evening in the knowledge that the fight against Lou Savarese in Glasgow the following Saturday will go ahead. A Glasgow city council licensing sub-committee yesterday took 50 minutes to decide to approve an application by Hampden Park stadium for a special safety certificate to stage the event. The decision was greeted with boos from about 25 protesters who attended the meeting. During the discussions it emerged that promoters had reduced the stadium capacity for the fight to 51,800 after failing to sell all 60,000 tickets. The stadium safety director, Tom Onions, confirmed that the seating would be cut back. The application was granted by a vote of 10 to one, with Scottish National Party councillor John Mason the only dissenter.",

      "body": "<p>In what they call a minor procedural change - though it looks to the rest of the world like a radical break with tradition - Jehovah's Witnesses are to be allowed to have blood transfusions; but only, as I understand it, so long as they later repent and seek spiritual guidance. Does that mean it's OK to say, \"Whoopee, I'll have the transfusion, and afterwards I'll repent, and that will make everything right?\" Not necessarily. It sounds as though the intention is rather that those who accept transfusions in moments of agony in order to save their lives will no longer be shunned as before. </p> <p>Like most non-believers, Smallweed finds these matters of doctrine somewhat elusive. But the question of what can be achieved by repentance has driven some sects and cults to more extreme conclusions. Some have gone so far as to justify sin as a kind of gateway to repentance and so to redemption, or because it is no more unclean than the rest of life, or for various other ingenious reasons. </p> <p>A wealth of such teachings is recorded in one of my favourite books, Norman Cohn's The Pursuit Of The Millennium. I especially commend an appendix which deals with a Ranter tract by a man called Laurence Clarkson, published in 1650. This describes his encounter with a sect called My One Flesh at a time when he believed that no man could be freed from sin until he had acted that sin; and also, if I follow his logic, which I'm not sure I do, that since to the pure all things were pure, there could be no impurity. </p> <p>In the full flood of this doctrine, he was invited by one Sarah Kullin to \"make trial\" of what he'd expressed in the fleshliest mode available. Before long, many other women were coming to Laurence hoping to be \"made free\"; \"This lustful principle,\" he wrote, \"encreased me so much that the Lord Mayor with his officers came to take me at midnight, but knowing thereof, he was prevented.\" I also commend the section on the Anabaptist John of Leyden, which makes some of the cults of our day look like models of self-restraint. </p> <p>So impressed was John with the biblical commandment \"go forth and multiply\" that he announced his conversion to polygamy and proceeded to take 15 wives, all but one of them under 20. Later, he proclaimed himself king, and while ordaining austerity for his followers, adopted for himself a lifestyle of gorgeous lavishness - explaining that pomp and luxury were permissible to him because he was dead to the flesh. There is more to be said on this theme in the context of the Agapemone movement in Somerset and the London suburb of Clapton, to which I intend to return when time permits. We have come a long way from the Witnesses here, but if it persuades just one reader to invest in a copy of Cohn, the excursion will have been justified. </p> <p>\u0095 When tuning in to something entirely different, I picked up a radio report that a movement is afoot in Cornwall \"to re-establish the chough\". The chough, for those who till now have been leading choughless lives, is a red-legged crow or any bird of the genus Fregilus or Pyrrhocorax. This is such a worthwhile enterprise that for only the second time, Smallweed today offers a line you can cut out and stick on your car's rear windscreen, alongside my classic, \"Keep the Harm Out of Harmondsworth\". Here it is: \"Re-establish the Chough!\" </p> <p>Follow these Smallweed campaigns and the back of your car should look pretty festive by Christmas. </p> <p>\u0095 How many times do I have to repeat the obvious truth that there's no such person as King Constantine of Greece? The Greeks got rid of him after the episode with the colonels, and quite right too. One accepts that this fictional entity will appear in the Telegraph papers, since they toady to anyone remotely royal, but one does not expect this error from the BBC. Nevertheless, a caption under a picture of Constantine in the news on Wednesday gave him the title of King. Here is a sticker for Mr Dyke's limousine: \"Ex-King in Future, Please - Greg\". </p> <p>\u0095 While looking for something else, I came this week across the word chorizont. What is the point of this word? It apparently means a person who thinks that the Odyssey and the Iliad were written by different people. Even if that controversy still persists, you surely don't need a separate word for them. By extension, I suppose, it could also cover those who think Shakespeare was written by Bacon, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake or Elizabeth I. Samuel Butler - the one who wrote The Way Of All Flesh, not the one who wrote Hudibras - used to maintain that both were the work of a woman. But even he was not a chorizont in the matter of Homer; he believed the same woman wrote both. </p> <p><strong> Gamesman (Hoddesdon) writes </strong> :<br> Smallweed should not be such a spoilsport. The word chorizont is essential to players of Scrabble, since it enables a player with the good sense to keep a \"c\" and a \"t\" to hand to cap an opponent who has just made the word \"horizon\". Here is a slogan for Smallweed to put in his car's rear window: \"Save Chorizont from Extinction\". </p> <p>\u0095 The fiction promulgated by Lord Jenkins, while rebuking the man now known as TB for being too shy about Europe, that the Victorians covered the legs of their pianos for reasons of modesty, was repeated this week, I am sorry to say, in this very newspaper. As a number of letters have confirmed, this story is a myth. They did cover their piano legs, yes, but only to keep them clean and stop them from being damaged. They fulfilled the same function as the antimacassar, which protected their chairs from being polluted with macassar or similar oils from visitors' hair. Not even Lord Jenkins at his most sonorously European would claim the antimacassar as an agent of modesty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In what they call a minor procedural change - though it looks to the rest of the world like a radical break with tradition - Jehovah's Witnesses are to be allowed to have blood transfusions; but only, as I understand it, so long as they later repent and seek spiritual guidance. Does that mean it's OK to say, \"Whoopee, I'll have the transfusion, and afterwards I'll repent, and that will make everything right?\" Not necessarily. It sounds as though the intention is rather that those who accept transfusions in moments of agony in order to save their lives will no longer be shunned as before. Like most non-believers, Smallweed finds these matters of doctrine somewhat elusive. But the question of what can be achieved by repentance has driven some sects and cults to more extreme conclusions. Some have gone so far as to justify sin as a kind of gateway to repentance and so to redemption, or because it is no more unclean than the rest of life, or for various other ingenious reasons. A wealth of such teachings is recorded in one of my favourite books, Norman Cohn's The Pursuit Of The Millennium. I especially commend an appendix which deals with a Ranter tract by a man called Laurence Clarkson, published in 1650. This describes his encounter with a sect called My One Flesh at a time when he believed that no man could be freed from sin until he had acted that sin; and also, if I follow his logic, which I'm not sure I do, that since to the pure all things were pure, there could be no impurity. In the full flood of this doctrine, he was invited by one Sarah Kullin to \"make trial\" of what he'd expressed in the fleshliest mode available. Before long, many other women were coming to Laurence hoping to be \"made free\"; \"This lustful principle,\" he wrote, \"encreased me so much that the Lord Mayor with his officers came to take me at midnight, but knowing thereof, he was prevented.\" I also commend the section on the Anabaptist John of Leyden, which makes some of the cults of our day look like models of self-restraint. So impressed was John with the biblical commandment \"go forth and multiply\" that he announced his conversion to polygamy and proceeded to take 15 wives, all but one of them under 20. Later, he proclaimed himself king, and while ordaining austerity for his followers, adopted for himself a lifestyle of gorgeous lavishness - explaining that pomp and luxury were permissible to him because he was dead to the flesh. There is more to be said on this theme in the context of the Agapemone movement in Somerset and the London suburb of Clapton, to which I intend to return when time permits. We have come a long way from the Witnesses here, but if it persuades just one reader to invest in a copy of Cohn, the excursion will have been justified. \u0095 When tuning in to something entirely different, I picked up a radio report that a movement is afoot in Cornwall \"to re-establish the chough\". The chough, for those who till now have been leading choughless lives, is a red-legged crow or any bird of the genus Fregilus or Pyrrhocorax. This is such a worthwhile enterprise that for only the second time, Smallweed today offers a line you can cut out and stick on your car's rear windscreen, alongside my classic, \"Keep the Harm Out of Harmondsworth\". Here it is: \"Re-establish the Chough!\" Follow these Smallweed campaigns and the back of your car should look pretty festive by Christmas. \u0095 How many times do I have to repeat the obvious truth that there's no such person as King Constantine of Greece? The Greeks got rid of him after the episode with the colonels, and quite right too. One accepts that this fictional entity will appear in the Telegraph papers, since they toady to anyone remotely royal, but one does not expect this error from the BBC. Nevertheless, a caption under a picture of Constantine in the news on Wednesday gave him the title of King. Here is a sticker for Mr Dyke's limousine: \"Ex-King in Future, Please - Greg\". \u0095 While looking for something else, I came this week across the word chorizont. What is the point of this word? It apparently means a person who thinks that the Odyssey and the Iliad were written by different people. Even if that controversy still persists, you surely don't need a separate word for them. By extension, I suppose, it could also cover those who think Shakespeare was written by Bacon, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake or Elizabeth I. Samuel Butler - the one who wrote The Way Of All Flesh, not the one who wrote Hudibras - used to maintain that both were the work of a woman. But even he was not a chorizont in the matter of Homer; he believed the same woman wrote both. Gamesman (Hoddesdon) writes : Smallweed should not be such a spoilsport. The word chorizont is essential to players of Scrabble, since it enables a player with the good sense to keep a \"c\" and a \"t\" to hand to cap an opponent who has just made the word \"horizon\". Here is a slogan for Smallweed to put in his car's rear window: \"Save Chorizont from Extinction\". \u0095 The fiction promulgated by Lord Jenkins, while rebuking the man now known as TB for being too shy about Europe, that the Victorians covered the legs of their pianos for reasons of modesty, was repeated this week, I am sorry to say, in this very newspaper. As a number of letters have confirmed, this story is a myth. They did cover their piano legs, yes, but only to keep them clean and stop them from being damaged. They fulfilled the same function as the antimacassar, which protected their chairs from being polluted with macassar or similar oils from visitors' hair. Not even Lord Jenkins at his most sonorously European would claim the antimacassar as an agent of modesty.",

Poetry may seem an odd word for a witch-hunt but I saw there was something of the marvellous in the spectacle of a whole village, if not an entire province, whose imagination was captured by a vision of something that wasn't there. </p> <p>In time to come, the notion of equating the red-hunt with the witch-hunt would be condemned as a deception. There were communists and there never were witches. The deeper I moved into the 1690s, the further away drifted the America of the 50s, and, rather than the appeal of analogy, I found something different to draw my curiosity and excitement. </p> <p>Anyone standing up in the Salem of 1692 and denying that witches existed would have faced immediate arrest, the hardest interrogation and possibly the rope. Every authority not only confirmed the existence of witches but never questioned the necessity of executing them. It became obvious that to dismiss witchcraft was to forgo any understanding of how it came to pass that tens of thousands had been murdered as witches in Europe. To dismiss any relation between that episode and the hunt for subversives was to shut down an insight into not only the similar emotions but also the identical practices of both officials and victims.</p> <p> There were witches, if not to most of us then certainly to everyone in Salem; and there were communists, but what was the content of their menace? That to me became the issue. Having been deeply influenced as a student by a Marxist approach to society, and having known Marxists and sympathisers, I could simply not accept that these people were spies or even prepared to do the will of the Soviets in some future crisis. That such people had thought to find hope of a higher ethic in the Soviet was not simply an American, but a worldwide, irony of catastrophic moral proportions, for their like could be found all over the world.</p> <p> But as the 50s dawned, they were stuck with the past. Part of the surreality of the anti-left sweep was that it picked up people for disgrace who had already turned away from a pro-Soviet past but had no stomach for naming others who had merely shared their illusions. But the hunt had captured some significant part of the American imagination and its power demanded respect. </p> <p>Turning to Salem was like looking into a petri dish, an embalmed stasis with its principal moving forces caught in stillness. One had to wonder what the human imagination fed on that could inspire neighbours and old friends to emerge overnight as furies secretly bent on the torture and destruction of Christians. More than a political metaphor, more than a moral tale, The Crucible, as it developed over more than a year, became the awesome evidence of the power of human imagination inflamed, the poetry of suggestion, and the tragedy of heroic resistance to a society possessed to the point of ruin. </p> <p>In the stillness of the Salem courthouse, surrounded by the images of the 1950s but with my head in 1692, what the two eras had in common gradually gained definition. Both had the menace of concealed plots, but most startling were the similarities in the rituals of defence, the investigative routines; 300 years apart, both prosecutions alleged membership of a secret, disloyal group. Should the accused confess, his honesty could only be proved by naming former confederates. The informer became the axle of the plot's existence and the investigation's necessity. </p> <p>The witch-hunt in 1692 had a not dissimilar problem, but a far more poetic solution. Most suspected people named by others as members of the Devil's conspiracy had not been shown to have done anything, neither poisoning wells, setting barns on fire, sickening cattle, aborting babies, nor undermining the virtue of wives (the Devil having two phenomenally active penises, one above the other). </p> <p>To the rescue came a piece of poetry, smacking of both legalistic and religious validity, called Spectral Evidence. All the prosecution need do was produce a witness who claimed to have seen, not an accused person, but his familiar spirit - his living ghost - in the act of throwing a burning brand into a barn full of hay. You could be at home asleep in your bed, but your spirit could be crawling through your neighbour's window to feel up his wife. The owner of the wandering spirit was obliged to account to the court for his crime. With Spectral Evidence, the air filled with the malign spirits of those identified by good Christians as confederates of theBeast, and the Devil himself danced happily into Salem village and took the place apart. </p> <p>I spent 10 days in Salem courthouse reading the crudely recorded trials of the 1692 outbreak, and it was striking how totally absent was any sense of irony, let alone humour. I can't recall if it was the provincial governor's nephew or son who, with a college friend, came from Boston to watch the strange proceedings. Both boys burst out laughing at some absurd testimony: they were promptly jailed, and faced possible hanging. </p> <p>Irony and humour were not conspicuous in the 1950s either. I was in my lawyer's office to sign some contract and a lawyer in the next office was asked to come in and notarise my signature. While he was stamping pages, I continued a discussion with my lawyer about the Broadway theatre, which I said was corrupt; the art of theatre had been totally displaced by the bottom line, all that mattered any more. Looking up at me, the notarising lawyer said, \"That's a communist position, you know.\" I started to laugh until I saw the constraint in my lawyer's face, and I quickly sobered up. </p> <p>I am glad that I managed to write The Crucible, but looking back I have often wished I'd had the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the situation deserved. Now, after more than three-quarters of a century of fascination with the great snake of political and social developments, I can see more than a few occasions when we were confronted by the same sensation of having stepped into another age. </p> <p>A young film producer asked me to write a script about what was then called juvenile delinquency. A mystifying, unprecedented outbreak of gang violence had exploded all over New York. The city, in return for a good percentage of profits, had contracted with this producer to open police stations and schools to his camera. I spent the summer of 1955 in Brooklyn streets with two gangs and wrote an outline. I was ready to proceed with the script when an attack on me as a disloyal lefty opened in the New York World Telegram. The cry went up that the city must cancel its contract with the producer so long as I was the screenwriter. A hearing was arranged, attended by 22 city commissioners, including the police, fire, welfare and sanitation departments, as well as two judges. </p> <p>At the conference table there also sat a lady who produced a thick folder of petitions and statements I had signed, going back to my college years, provided to her by the Huac. I defended myself; I thought I was making sense when the lady began screaming that I was killing the boys in Korea [this was during the Korean war]. She meant me personally, as I could tell from the froth at the corners of her mouth, the fury in her eyes, and her finger pointing straight into my face. </p> <p>The vote was taken and came up one short of continuing the city's collaboration, and the film was killed that afternoon. I always wondered whether the crucial vote against me came from the sanitation department. But it was not a total loss; the suffocating sensation of helplessness before the spectacle of the impossible coming to pass would soon help in writing The Crucible. </p> <p>That impossible coming to pass was not an observation made at a comfortable distance but a blade cutting directly into my life. This was especially the case with Elia Kazan's decision to cooperate with the Huac. The surrounding fears felt even by those with the most fleeting of contacts with any communist-supported organisation were enough to break through long associations and friendships. </p> <p>Kazan had been a member of the Communist party only a matter of months, and even that link had ended years before. And the party had never been illegal, nor was membership in it. Yet this great director, left undefended by 20th Century Fox executives, his longtime employers, was told that if he refused to name people whom he had known in the party - actors, directors and writers - he would never be allowed to direct another picture in Hollywood, meaning the end of his career. </p> <p>These names were already known to the committee through other testifiers and FBI informants, but exactly as in Salem - or Russia under the Czar and the Chairman, and Inquisition Spain, Revolutionary France or any other place of revolution or counter-revolution - conspiracy was the name for all opposition. And the reformation of the accused could only be believed when he gave up the names of his co-conspirators. Only this ritual of humiliation, the breaking of pride and independence, could win the accused readmission into the community. The process inevitably did produce in the accused a new set of political, social and even moral convictions more acceptable to the state whose fist had been shoved into his face, with his utter ruin promised should he resist. </p> <p>I had stopped by Kazan's house in the country in 1952 after he had called me to come and talk, an unusual invitation - he had never been inclined to indulge in talk unless it concerned work. I had suspected from his dark tone that it must have to do with the Huac, which was rampaging through the Hollywood ranks . </p> <p>Since I was on my way up to Salem for research on a play that I was still unsure I would write, I called at his house, which was on my route. As he laid out his dilemma and his decision to comply with the Huac (which he had already done) it was impossible not to feel his anguish, old friends that we were. But the crunch came when I felt fear, that great teacher, that cruel revealer. For it swept over me that, had I been one of his comrades, he would have spent my name as part of the guarantee of his reform. Even so, oddly enough, I was not filling up with hatred or contempt for him; his suffering was too palpable. The whole hateful procedure had brought him to this, and I believe made the writing of The Crucible all but inevitable. Even if one could grant Kazan sincerity in his new-found anti-communism, the concept of an America where such self-discoveries were pressed out of people was outrageous, and a contradiction of any concept of personal liberty. </p> <p>Is all this of some objective importance in our history, this destruction of bonds between people? I think it may be, however personal it may appear. Kazan's testimony created a far greater shock than anyone else's. Lee J Cobb's similar testimony and Jerome Robbins's cooperation seemed hardly to matter. It may be that Kazan had been loved more than any other, that he had attracted far greater affection from writers and actors with whom he had worked, and so what was overtly a political act was sensed as a betrayal of love. </p> <p>It is very significant that in the uproar set off by last year's award to Kazan of an Oscar for life achievement, one heard no mention of the name of any member of the Huac. One doubted whether the thought occurred to many people that the studio heads had ignominiously collapsed before the Huac's insistence that they institute a blacklist of artists, something they had once insisted was dishonourable and a violation of democratic norms. Half a century had passed since his testimony, but Kazan bore very nearly the whole onus of the era, as though he had manufactured its horrors - when he was surely its victim. </p> <p>The trial record in Salem courthouse had been written by ministers in a primitive shorthand. This condensation gave emphasis to a gnarled, densely packed language which suggested the country accents of a hard people. To lose oneself day after day in that record of human delusion was to know a fear, not for one's safety, but of the spectacle of intelligent people giving themselves over to a rapture of murderous credulity. It was as though the absence of real evidence was itself a release from the burdens of this world; in love with the invisible, they moved behind their priests, closer to that mystical communion which is anarchy and is called God. </p> <p>Evidence, in contrast, is effort; leaping to conclusions is a wonderful pleasure, and for a while there was a highly charged joy in Salem, for now that they could see through everything to the frightful plot that was daily being laid bare in court sessions, their days, formerly so eventless and long, were swallowed up in hourly revelations, news, surprises. The Crucible is less a polemic than it might have been had it not been filled with wonder at the protean imagination of man. </p> <p>The Crucible straddles two different worlds to make them one, but it is not history in the usual sense of the word, but a moral, political and psychological construct that floats on the fluid emotions of both eras. As a commercial entertainment the play failed [it opened in 1953]. To start with there was the title: nobody knew what a crucible was. Most of the critics, as sometimes does happen, never caught on to the play's ironical substructure, and the ones who did were nervous about validating a work that was so unkind to the same sanctified procedural principles as underlay the hunt for reds. Some old acquaintances gave me distant nods in the theatre lobby on opening night, and even without air-conditioning the house was cool. There was also a problem with the temperature of the production. </p> <p>The director, Jed Harris, a great name in the theatre of the 20s, 30s and 40s, had decided that the play, which he believed a classic, should be staged like a Dutch painting. In Dutch paintings of groups, everyone is always looking front. Unfortunately, on a stage such rigidity can only lead an audience to the exits. Several years after, a gang of young actors, setting up chairs in the ballroom of the McAlpin Hotel, fired up the audience, convinced the critics, and the play at last took off and soon found its place. There were cheering reviews but by then Senator McCarthy was dead. The public fever on whose heatwaves he had spread his wings had subsided. </p> <p>The Crucible is my most-produced play. It seems to be one of the few surviving shards of the so-called McCarthy period. And it is part of the play's history that, to people in so many parts of the world, its story seems to be their own. I used to think, half seriously, that you could tell when a dictator was about to take power, or had been overthrown, in a Latin American country, if The Crucible was suddenly being produced in that country. </p> <p>The result of it all is that I have come, rather reluctantly, to respect delusion, not least of all my own. There are no passions quite as hot and pleasurable as those of the deluded. Compared to the bliss of delusion, its vivid colours, blazing lights, explosions, whistles and liberating joys, the search for evidence is a deadly bore. My heart was with the left. if only because the right hated me enough to want to kill me, as the Germans amply proved. And now, the most blatant and most foul anti-semitism is in Russia, leaving people like me filled not so much with surprise as a kind of wonder at the incredible amount of hope there once was, and how it disappeared and whether in time it will ever come again, attached, no doubt, to some new illusion. </p> <p>There is hardly a week that passes when I don't ask the unanswerable question: what am I now convinced of that will turn out to be ridiculous? And yet one can't forever stand on the shore; at some point, filled with indecision, scepticism, reservation and doubt, you either jump in or concede that life is forever elsewhere. Which, I dare say, was one of the major impulses behind the decision to attempt The Crucible. </p> <p>Salem village, that pious, devout settlement at the edge of white civilisation, had displayed - three centuries before the Russo-American rivalry and the issues it raised - what can only be called a built-in pestilence in the human mind; a fatality forever awaiting the right conditions for its always unique, forever unprecedented outbreak of distrust, alarm, suspicion and murder. And for people wherever the play is performed on any of the five continents, there is always a certain amazement that the same terror that is happening to them or that is threatening them, has happened before to others. It is all very strange. But then, the Devil is known to lure people into forgetting what it is vital for them to remember - how else could his endless reappearances always come as such a marvellous surprise? </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Arthur Miller </p> <p>\u0095 The crucible in history and Other Essays by Arthur Miller is published by Methuen on 13 July 2000 @ \u00a310.00</p>",

Since I was on my way up to Salem for research on a play that I was still unsure I would write, I called at his house, which was on my route. As he laid out his dilemma and his decision to comply with the Huac (which he had already done) it was impossible not to feel his anguish, old friends that we were. But the crunch came when I felt fear, that great teacher, that cruel revealer. For it swept over me that, had I been one of his comrades, he would have spent my name as part of the guarantee of his reform. Even so, oddly enough, I was not filling up with hatred or contempt for him; his suffering was too palpable. The whole hateful procedure had brought him to this, and I believe made the writing of The Crucible all but inevitable. Even if one could grant Kazan sincerity in his new-found anti-communism, the concept of an America where such self-discoveries were pressed out of people was outrageous, and a contradiction of any concept of personal liberty. Is all this of some objective importance in our history, this destruction of bonds between people? I think it may be, however personal it may appear. Kazan's testimony created a far greater shock than anyone else's. Lee J Cobb's similar testimony and Jerome Robbins's cooperation seemed hardly to matter. It may be that Kazan had been loved more than any other, that he had attracted far greater affection from writers and actors with whom he had worked, and so what was overtly a political act was sensed as a betrayal of love. It is very significant that in the uproar set off by last year's award to Kazan of an Oscar for life achievement, one heard no mention of the name of any member of the Huac. One doubted whether the thought occurred to many people that the studio heads had ignominiously collapsed before the Huac's insistence that they institute a blacklist of artists, something they had once insisted was dishonourable and a violation of democratic norms. Half a century had passed since his testimony, but Kazan bore very nearly the whole onus of the era, as though he had manufactured its horrors - when he was surely its victim. The trial record in Salem courthouse had been written by ministers in a primitive shorthand. This condensation gave emphasis to a gnarled, densely packed language which suggested the country accents of a hard people. To lose oneself day after day in that record of human delusion was to know a fear, not for one's safety, but of the spectacle of intelligent people giving themselves over to a rapture of murderous credulity. It was as though the absence of real evidence was itself a release from the burdens of this world; in love with the invisible, they moved behind their priests, closer to that mystical communion which is anarchy and is called God. Evidence, in contrast, is effort; leaping to conclusions is a wonderful pleasure, and for a while there was a highly charged joy in Salem, for now that they could see through everything to the frightful plot that was daily being laid bare in court sessions, their days, formerly so eventless and long, were swallowed up in hourly revelations, news, surprises. The Crucible is less a polemic than it might have been had it not been filled with wonder at the protean imagination of man. The Crucible straddles two different worlds to make them one, but it is not history in the usual sense of the word, but a moral, political and psychological construct that floats on the fluid emotions of both eras. As a commercial entertainment the play failed [it opened in 1953]. To start with there was the title: nobody knew what a crucible was. Most of the critics, as sometimes does happen, never caught on to the play's ironical substructure, and the ones who did were nervous about validating a work that was so unkind to the same sanctified procedural principles as underlay the hunt for reds. Some old acquaintances gave me distant nods in the theatre lobby on opening night, and even without air-conditioning the house was cool. There was also a problem with the temperature of the production. The director, Jed Harris, a great name in the theatre of the 20s, 30s and 40s, had decided that the play, which he believed a classic, should be staged like a Dutch painting. In Dutch paintings of groups, everyone is always looking front. Unfortunately, on a stage such rigidity can only lead an audience to the exits. Several years after, a gang of young actors, setting up chairs in the ballroom of the McAlpin Hotel, fired up the audience, convinced the critics, and the play at last took off and soon found its place. There were cheering reviews but by then Senator McCarthy was dead. The public fever on whose heatwaves he had spread his wings had subsided. The Crucible is my most-produced play. It seems to be one of the few surviving shards of the so-called McCarthy period. And it is part of the play's history that, to people in so many parts of the world, its story seems to be their own. I used to think, half seriously, that you could tell when a dictator was about to take power, or had been overthrown, in a Latin American country, if The Crucible was suddenly being produced in that country. The result of it all is that I have come, rather reluctantly, to respect delusion, not least of all my own. There are no passions quite as hot and pleasurable as those of the deluded. Compared to the bliss of delusion, its vivid colours, blazing lights, explosions, whistles and liberating joys, the search for evidence is a deadly bore. My heart was with the left. if only because the right hated me enough to want to kill me, as the Germans amply proved. And now, the most blatant and most foul anti-semitism is in Russia, leaving people like me filled not so much with surprise as a kind of wonder at the incredible amount of hope there once was, and how it disappeared and whether in time it will ever come again, attached, no doubt, to some new illusion. There is hardly a week that passes when I don't ask the unanswerable question: what am I now convinced of that will turn out to be ridiculous? And yet one can't forever stand on the shore; at some point, filled with indecision, scepticism, reservation and doubt, you either jump in or concede that life is forever elsewhere. Which, I dare say, was one of the major impulses behind the decision to attempt The Crucible. Salem village, that pious, devout settlement at the edge of white civilisation, had displayed - three centuries before the Russo-American rivalry and the issues it raised - what can only be called a built-in pestilence in the human mind; a fatality forever awaiting the right conditions for its always unique, forever unprecedented outbreak of distrust, alarm, suspicion and murder. And for people wherever the play is performed on any of the five continents, there is always a certain amazement that the same terror that is happening to them or that is threatening them, has happened before to others. It is all very strange. But then, the Devil is known to lure people into forgetting what it is vital for them to remember - how else could his endless reappearances always come as such a marvellous surprise? \u00a9 2000 Arthur Miller \u0095 The crucible in history and Other Essays by Arthur Miller is published by Methuen on 13 July 2000 @ \u00a310.00",

      "body": "<p> It has been a good week for Gary Mitchell. First he shared the George Devine award for his magnificent play about the RUC, The Force of Change - surely due for a revival at the Royal Court since everyone has heard of it but few have seen it. Then on Tuesday Mitchell's latest play, Marching On, opened at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, and confirmed his energy and talent.</p> <p> Seeing Mitchell played on home ground, one realised he has the rare gift of speaking to his own community while reaching out to the world beyond. Marching On could hardly be more topical. As the Belfast bonfires are being built in readiness for the Orange festivities, Mitchell explores the divisions inside the Unionist community through a typically fractious family. </p> <p>The grandfather, Samuel, is an old-style Orangeman who simply wants to march in peace. His son, Chris, is a surly RUC night-worker coping with an impossible job and his wife's defection. The real problems come from grandson Ricky, an active member of a boys' band who has a knee-jerk hatred of Catholics. Add a Scottish visitor who is idolised by Ricky's randy sister and you have a recipe for trouble. </p> <p>As in his earlier plays, Mitchell suggests that Northern Ireland's problems are as much generational as sectarian. In Trust he showed a 15-year-old boy used as a personal battleground by his UDA father and his intransigent mother. Here he reverses the situation, showing the unruly Ricky, product of a divided home and culture, as the flame that lights the blue touch-paper. A Catholic residents' group, post-Drumcree, asks for an Orange Order march to be re-routed. Its claim is upheld. Result: chaos on the streets, with Ricky and his mates seeking revenge by torching Catholic homes and burning cars. </p> <p>In Mitchell's persuasive view, divided families are a metaphor for a divided community.

      "bodyText": "It has been a good week for Gary Mitchell. First he shared the George Devine award for his magnificent play about the RUC, The Force of Change - surely due for a revival at the Royal Court since everyone has heard of it but few have seen it. Then on Tuesday Mitchell's latest play, Marching On, opened at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, and confirmed his energy and talent. Seeing Mitchell played on home ground, one realised he has the rare gift of speaking to his own community while reaching out to the world beyond. Marching On could hardly be more topical. As the Belfast bonfires are being built in readiness for the Orange festivities, Mitchell explores the divisions inside the Unionist community through a typically fractious family. The grandfather, Samuel, is an old-style Orangeman who simply wants to march in peace. His son, Chris, is a surly RUC night-worker coping with an impossible job and his wife's defection. The real problems come from grandson Ricky, an active member of a boys' band who has a knee-jerk hatred of Catholics. Add a Scottish visitor who is idolised by Ricky's randy sister and you have a recipe for trouble. As in his earlier plays, Mitchell suggests that Northern Ireland's problems are as much generational as sectarian. In Trust he showed a 15-year-old boy used as a personal battleground by his UDA father and his intransigent mother. Here he reverses the situation, showing the unruly Ricky, product of a divided home and culture, as the flame that lights the blue touch-paper. A Catholic residents' group, post-Drumcree, asks for an Orange Order march to be re-routed. Its claim is upheld. Result: chaos on the streets, with Ricky and his mates seeking revenge by torching Catholic homes and burning cars. In Mitchell's persuasive view, divided families are a metaphor for a divided community. And, as in his previous plays, he suggests that no one has a monopoly on truth. The pious grandad argues for \"dignified\" marches but signally fails to discipline Ricky and is quick to endorse routine quips like, \"Does the Pope wear a dress?\" Ricky may be the product of an absentee mother and a moody dad, but he's still a cocky show-off filled with paranoid prejudices. Intriguingly, the audience's sympathies, judging by their applause, go to the beleaguered RUC dad, who laments that he has to carry the can for the community's failures; yet Mitchell also shows that the man is a bit of a brute, who carries his strong-arm tactics into the home.

      "body": "<p>The summer has unofficially become London's ballet season, which means that we are currently watching the Kirov and Zurich Ballet vying for the dance pound alongside the resident claims of English National Ballet and the Royal. The programmes being danced by these four companies are of course a pot-luck assortment. But looked at overall, they present an interesting Polaroid of the state of ballet today. </p> <p>One thing they tell us for sure is that the 19th-century classics have lost none of their appeal. ENB is currently hoping to net over 50,000 viewers for its spectacle-driven version of Sleeping Beauty in the Royal Albert Hall; the Kirov at Covent Garden is presenting the same ballet alongside other familiar classics. The strategy behind ENB's mass-scale Beauty is unabashed populism: the company has beefed up the ballet's glitz and sex appeal and is counting on the familiar Tchaikovsky score to lure the punters. Meanwhile the Kirov, which has lost much of its generous state subsidy, is fighting to build a mass audience with a staging driven by scholarship. Its four-hour Sleeping Beauty reconstructs the original 1890 production, complete with elaborate mime, processionals and historic costumes. The production sounds like only a balletomane's idea of fun, but the rapturous response with which it has been greeted suggests the public likes the real thing as much as the lite version. </p> <p>But companies also need new works on which to stake their futures - even though the cost of making them has spiralled scarily and the box office gamble has become more intense. The Royal Ballet is thus lucky to have the new, small scale facilities of the Opera House's Linbury Theatre, where it can stage programmes of new works. This quasi-laboratory situation is a rare luxury, allowing choreographers to play outside of the pressured environment of the Opera House, and hopefully attract a more adventurous public than the traditionally conservative ballet crowd. The classics of the future may well come from here. </p> <p>Zurich Ballet, under the rejuvenating direction of Heinz Spoerli, already performs a largely contemporary repertory - but it does so in part by maintaining a canny element of name recognition. The title of its London debut production Mozartina says it all: if there's any composer other than Tchaikovsky to snare the public, it's Mozart. </p> <p>Spoerli's ballet is a kind of encounter between Mozart, his music and the 20th century. There isn't a narrative as such, although at its heart is a Mozartian figure (Michael Revie), who moves through the dancers with a quizzical detachment and an assortment of gimmicks, and may be supposed to offer an oblique comment on history. The dancers regularly change from 18th to 20th-century costumes and at one point Revie looks appropriately startled as huge rubber balls bounce around the stage with images of Mozart's face stamped on them. Frequently, a moving walkway delivers the dancers on and off the stage. Grinning and posing, they look like prizes displayed in a TV game show. </p> <p>These are irritating distractions from Spoerli's choreography, which has some appealing features. His characteristic lines are lean, stretched and disciplined, yet they are punctuated by moments of unpredictable abandon when dancers skid joyfully on their own momentum and reinvent classical lifts with an acrobatic flourish. The choreography looks particularly good on Revie, who, with his clever, secretive face and dynamic intensity, is a figure of considerable charisma. </p> <p>The ballet is, however, two hours long, and its length exposes its weaknesses cruelly. Spoerli may create interesting individual moves but they do little other than skim over the surface of the medley of Mozart's scores. There is no counter-argument in the dance's structure that would allow us to hear the music freshly, nor is there any emotional engagement with it. The steps just keep coming, regardless of what is being played. </p> <p>Mozartina may flourish its lack of sentiment and clutter like a badge of modernity, but the fact that many of its devices are raided from ballets which were voguish a generation ago makes it look, actually, rather old-fashioned. It certainly doesn't look as if Spoerli created it because he had something urgent to say about the music or the subject. And without that urgency, an art form can never be renewed.</p> <p> \u0095 English National Ballet's Sleeping Beauty is at the Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 (020-7589 8212), till Tuesday.

The classics of the future may well come from here. Zurich Ballet, under the rejuvenating direction of Heinz Spoerli, already performs a largely contemporary repertory - but it does so in part by maintaining a canny element of name recognition. The title of its London debut production Mozartina says it all: if there's any composer other than Tchaikovsky to snare the public, it's Mozart. Spoerli's ballet is a kind of encounter between Mozart, his music and the 20th century. There isn't a narrative as such, although at its heart is a Mozartian figure (Michael Revie), who moves through the dancers with a quizzical detachment and an assortment of gimmicks, and may be supposed to offer an oblique comment on history. The dancers regularly change from 18th to 20th-century costumes and at one point Revie looks appropriately startled as huge rubber balls bounce around the stage with images of Mozart's face stamped on them. Frequently, a moving walkway delivers the dancers on and off the stage. Grinning and posing, they look like prizes displayed in a TV game show. These are irritating distractions from Spoerli's choreography, which has some appealing features. His characteristic lines are lean, stretched and disciplined, yet they are punctuated by moments of unpredictable abandon when dancers skid joyfully on their own momentum and reinvent classical lifts with an acrobatic flourish. The choreography looks particularly good on Revie, who, with his clever, secretive face and dynamic intensity, is a figure of considerable charisma. The ballet is, however, two hours long, and its length exposes its weaknesses cruelly. Spoerli may create interesting individual moves but they do little other than skim over the surface of the medley of Mozart's scores. There is no counter-argument in the dance's structure that would allow us to hear the music freshly, nor is there any emotional engagement with it. The steps just keep coming, regardless of what is being played. Mozartina may flourish its lack of sentiment and clutter like a badge of modernity, but the fact that many of its devices are raided from ballets which were voguish a generation ago makes it look, actually, rather old-fashioned. It certainly doesn't look as if Spoerli created it because he had something urgent to say about the music or the subject. And without that urgency, an art form can never be renewed. \u0095 English National Ballet's Sleeping Beauty is at the Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 (020-7589 8212), till Tuesday. The Kirov's Sleeping Beauty is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till August 10.",

      "body": "<p>It would probably never have occurred to me to write a play about the Salem witch trials of 1692 had I not seen some astonishing correspondences with that calamity in the America of the late 40s and early 50s. My basic need was to respond to a phenomenon which, with only small exaggeration, one could say paralysed a whole generation and in a short time dried up the habits of trust and toleration in public discourse. </p> <p> I refer to the anti-communist rage that threatened to reach hysterical proportions and sometimes did. I can't remember anyone calling it an ideological war, but I think now that that is what it amounted to. I suppose we rapidly passed over anything like a discussion or debate, and into something quite different, a hunt not just for subversive people, but for ideas and even a suspect language. The object was to destroy the least credibility of any and all ideas associated with socialism and communism, whose proponents were assumed to be either knowing or unwitting agents of Soviet subversion.</p> <p> An ideological war is like guerrilla war, since the enemy is an idea whose proponents are not in uniform but are disguised as ordinary citizens, a situation that can scare a lot of people to death. To call the atmosphere paranoid is not to say that there was nothing real in the American-Soviet stand-off. But if there was one element that lent the conflict a tone of the inauthentic and the invented, it was the swiftness with which all values were forced in months to reverse themselves. </p> <p> Death of a Salesman opened in February 1949 and was hailed by nearly every newspaper and magazine. Several movie studios wanted it and finally Columbia Pictures bought it, and engaged a great actor, Frederick March, to play Willy [the central character]. </p> <p>In two years or less, with the picture finished, I was asked by a terrified Columbia to sign an anti-communist declaration to ward off picket lines which the rightwing American Legion was threatening to throw across the entrances of theatres showing the film. In the phone calls that followed, the air of panic was heavy. It was the first intimation of what would soon follow. I declined to make any such statement, which I found demeaning; what right had any organisation to demand anyone's pledge of loyalty? I was sure the whole thing would soon go away; it was just too outrageous. </p> <p>But instead of the problem disappearing, the studio actually made another film, a short to be shown with Salesman. This was called The Life of a Salesman and consisted of several lectures by City College School of Business professors - which boiled down to selling was a joy, one of the most gratifying and useful professions, and that Willy was simply a nut. Never in show-business history has a studio spent so much good money to prove that its feature film was pointless. In less than two years Death of a Salesman had gone from being a masterpiece to being a heresy, and a fraudulent one at that. </p> <p>In 1948-51, I had the sensation of being trapped inside a perverse work of art, one of those Escher constructs in which it is impossible to make out whether a stairway is going up or down. Practically everyone I knew stood within the conventions of the political left of centre; one or two were Communist party members, some were fellow-travellers, and most had had a brush with Marxist ideas or organisations. I have never been able to believe in the reality of these people being actual or putative traitors any more than I could be, yet others like them were being fired from teaching or jobs in government or large corporations. The surreality of it all never left me. We were living in an art form, a metaphor that had suddenly, incredibly, gripped the country.</p> <p> In today's terms, the country had been delivered into the hands of the radical right, a ministry of free-floating apprehension toward anything that never happens in the middle of Missouri. It is always with us, this anxiety, sometimes directed towards foreigners, Jews, Catholics, fluoridated water, aliens in space, masturbation, homosexuality, or the Internal Revenue Department. But in the 50s any of these could be validated as real threats by rolling out a map of China. And if this seems crazy now, it seemed just as crazy then, but openly doubting it could cost you.</p> <p> So in one sense The Crucible was an attempt to make life real again, palpable and structured. One hoped that a work of art might illuminate the tragic absurdities of an anterior work of art that was called reality, but was not. It was the very swiftness of the change that lent it this surreality. Only three or four years earlier an American movie audience, on seeing a newsreel of Stalin saluting the Red Army, would have applauded, for that army had taken the brunt of the Nazi onslaught, as most people were aware. Now they would look on with fear or at least bewilderment, for the Russians had become the enemy of mankind, a menace to all that was good. It was the Germans who, with amazing rapidity, were turning good. Could this be real?</p> <p> In the unions, communists and their allies, known as intrepid organisers, were to be shorn of membership and turned out as seditious. Harry Bridges, the idol of west coast longshoremen, whom he had all but single-handedly organised, was subjected to trial after trial to drive him back to his native Australia as an unadmitted communist. Academics, some prominent in their fields, were especially targeted, many forced to retire or fired for disloyalty. Some were communists, some were fellow travellers and, inevitably, a certain number were unaffiliated liberals refusing to sign one of the dozens of humiliating anti-communist pledges being required by terrified college administrations. </p> <p>But it is impossible to convey properly the fears that marked that period. Nobody was shot, to be sure, although some were going to jail, where at least one, William Remington, was murdered by an inmate hoping to shorten his sentence by having killed a communist. Rather than physical fear, it was the sense of impotence, which seemed to deepen with each week, of being unable to speak accurately of the very recent past when being leftwing in America, and for that matter in Europe, was to be alive to the dilemmas of the day. </p> <p>As for the idea of willingly subjecting my work not only to some party's discipline but to anyone's control, my repugnance was such that, as a young and indigent writer, I had turned down lucrative offers to work for Hollywood studios because of a revulsion at the thought of someone owning the paper I was typing on. It was not long, perhaps four or five years, before the fraudulence of Soviet cultural claims was as clear to me as it should have been earlier. But I would never have found it believable, in the 50s or later, that with its thuggish self-righteousness and callous contempt for artists' freedoms, that the Soviet way of controlling culture could be successfully exported to America. </p> <p>Some greatly talented people were driven out of the US to work in England: screenwriters like Carl Foreman and Donald Ogden Stewart, actors like Charlie Chaplin and Sam Wanamaker. I no longer recall the number of our political exiles, but it was more than too many and disgraceful for a nation prideful of its democracy. </p> <p>Writing now, almost half a century later, with the Soviet Union in ruins, China rhetorically fending off capitalism even as in reality it adopts a market economy, Cuba wallowing helplessly in the Caribbean, it is not easy to convey the American fear of a masterful communism. The quickness with which Soviet-style regimes had taken over eastern Europe and China was breathtaking, and I believe it stirred up a fear in Americans of our own ineptitudes, our mystifying inability, despite our military victories, to control the world whose liberties we had so recently won back from the Axis powers. </p> <p>In 1956, the House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) subpoenaed me - I was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to identify writers I had met at one of the two communist writers' meetings I had attended many years before. By then, the tide was going out for Huac and it was finding it more difficult to make front pages. However, the news of my forthcoming marriage to Marilyn Monroe was too tempting to be passed. That our marriage had some connection with my being subpoenaed was confirmed when Chairman Walters of the Huac sent word to Joseph Rauh, my lawyer, that he would be inclined to cancel my hearing if Miss Monroe would consent to have a picture taken with him. </p> <p>The offer having been declined, the good chairman, as my hearing came to an end, entreated me to write less tragically about our country. This lecture cost me $40,000 in lawyer's fees, a year's suspended sentence for contempt of Congress, and a $500 fine. Not to mention about a year of inanition in my creative life. </p> <p>My fictional view of the period, my sense of its unreality had been, like any impotence, a psychologically painful experience. A similar paralysis descended on Salem. In both places, to keep social unity intact, the authority of leaders had to be hardened and words of scepticism toward them constricted. A new cautionary diction, an uncustomary prudence inflected our way of talking to one another. The word socialism was all but taboo. Words had gotten fearsome. As I learned directly in Ann Arbor on a 1953 visit, university students were avoiding renting rooms in houses run by the housing cooperative for fear of being labelled communist, so darkly suggestive was the word cooperative. The head of orientation at the university told me, in a rather cool, uninvolved manner, that the FBI was enlisting professors to report on students voicing leftwing opinions, and - more comedy - that they had also engaged students to report on professors with the same views. </p> <p> In the early 50s, along with Elia Kazan, who had directed All My Sons and Death of a Salesman, I submitted a script to Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures. It described the murderous corruption in the gangster-ridden Brooklyn longshoremen's union. Cohn read the script and called us to Hollywood, where he casually informed us that he had had the script vetted by the FBI, and that they had seen nothing subversive in it. But the head of the AFL motion picture unions in Hollywood, Roy Brewer, had condemned it as untrue communist propaganda, since there were no gangsters on the Brooklyn waterfront. Cohn, no stranger to gangsterism, having survived an upbringing in the tough Five Points area of Manhattan, opined that Brewer was only trying to protect Joe Ryan, head of the Brooklyn longshoremen (who, incidentally, would go to Sing Sing prison for gangsterism). </p> <p>Brewer threatened to call a strike of projectionists in any theatre daring to show the film. Cohn offered his solution to the problem: he would produce the film if I would make one change - the gangsters in the union were to be changed to communists. This would not be easy; I knew all the communists on the waterfront- there were two of them (both of whom in the following decade became millionaire businessmen). So I had to withdraw the script, which prompted an indignant telegram from Cohn: \"As soon as we try to make the script pro-American you pull out.\" One understood not only the threat but also the cynicism: he knew the mafia controlled waterfront labour. Had I been a movie writer, my career would have ended. But the theatre had no such complications, no blacklist - not yet - and I longed to respond to this climate of fear, if only to protect my sanity. But where to find a transcendent concept? </p> <p>The heart of the darkness was the belief that a massive, profoundly organised conspiracy was in place and carried forward mainly by a concealed phalanx of intellectuals, including labour activists, teachers, professionals, sworn to undermine the American government. And it was precisely the invisibility of ideas that was frightening so many people. How could a play deal with this mirage world?</p> <p> Paranoia breeds paranoia, but below paranoia there lies a bristling, unwelcome truth, so repugnant as to produce fantasies of persecution to conceal its existence. The unwelcome truth denied by the right was that the Hollywood writers accused of subversion were not a menace to the country, or even bearers of meaningful change. They wrote not propaganda but entertainment, some of it of a mildly liberal cast, but most of it mindless, or when it was political, as with Preston Sturges or Frank Capra, entirely and exuberantly un-Marxist.</p> <p> As for the left, its unacknowledged truth was more important for me. If nobody was being shot in our ideological war but merely vivisected by a headline, it struck me as odd, if understandable , that the accused were unable to cry out passionately their faith in the ideals of socialism. There were attacks on the Huac's right to demand that a citizen reveal his political beliefs; but on the idealistic canon of their own convictions, the defendants were mute. The rare exception, like Paul Robeson's declaration of faith in socialism as a cure for racism, was a rocket that lit up the sky. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It would probably never have occurred to me to write a play about the Salem witch trials of 1692 had I not seen some astonishing correspondences with that calamity in the America of the late 40s and early 50s. My basic need was to respond to a phenomenon which, with only small exaggeration, one could say paralysed a whole generation and in a short time dried up the habits of trust and toleration in public discourse. I refer to the anti-communist rage that threatened to reach hysterical proportions and sometimes did. I can't remember anyone calling it an ideological war, but I think now that that is what it amounted to. I suppose we rapidly passed over anything like a discussion or debate, and into something quite different, a hunt not just for subversive people, but for ideas and even a suspect language. The object was to destroy the least credibility of any and all ideas associated with socialism and communism, whose proponents were assumed to be either knowing or unwitting agents of Soviet subversion. An ideological war is like guerrilla war, since the enemy is an idea whose proponents are not in uniform but are disguised as ordinary citizens, a situation that can scare a lot of people to death. To call the atmosphere paranoid is not to say that there was nothing real in the American-Soviet stand-off. But if there was one element that lent the conflict a tone of the inauthentic and the invented, it was the swiftness with which all values were forced in months to reverse themselves. Death of a Salesman opened in February 1949 and was hailed by nearly every newspaper and magazine. Several movie studios wanted it and finally Columbia Pictures bought it, and engaged a great actor, Frederick March, to play Willy [the central character]. In two years or less, with the picture finished, I was asked by a terrified Columbia to sign an anti-communist declaration to ward off picket lines which the rightwing American Legion was threatening to throw across the entrances of theatres showing the film. In the phone calls that followed, the air of panic was heavy. It was the first intimation of what would soon follow. I declined to make any such statement, which I found demeaning; what right had any organisation to demand anyone's pledge of loyalty? I was sure the whole thing would soon go away; it was just too outrageous. But instead of the problem disappearing, the studio actually made another film, a short to be shown with Salesman. This was called The Life of a Salesman and consisted of several lectures by City College School of Business professors - which boiled down to selling was a joy, one of the most gratifying and useful professions, and that Willy was simply a nut. Never in show-business history has a studio spent so much good money to prove that its feature film was pointless. In less than two years Death of a Salesman had gone from being a masterpiece to being a heresy, and a fraudulent one at that. In 1948-51, I had the sensation of being trapped inside a perverse work of art, one of those Escher constructs in which it is impossible to make out whether a stairway is going up or down. Practically everyone I knew stood within the conventions of the political left of centre; one or two were Communist party members, some were fellow-travellers, and most had had a brush with Marxist ideas or organisations. I have never been able to believe in the reality of these people being actual or putative traitors any more than I could be, yet others like them were being fired from teaching or jobs in government or large corporations. The surreality of it all never left me. We were living in an art form, a metaphor that had suddenly, incredibly, gripped the country. In today's terms, the country had been delivered into the hands of the radical right, a ministry of free-floating apprehension toward anything that never happens in the middle of Missouri. It is always with us, this anxiety, sometimes directed towards foreigners, Jews, Catholics, fluoridated water, aliens in space, masturbation, homosexuality, or the Internal Revenue Department. But in the 50s any of these could be validated as real threats by rolling out a map of China. And if this seems crazy now, it seemed just as crazy then, but openly doubting it could cost you. So in one sense The Crucible was an attempt to make life real again, palpable and structured. One hoped that a work of art might illuminate the tragic absurdities of an anterior work of art that was called reality, but was not. It was the very swiftness of the change that lent it this surreality. Only three or four years earlier an American movie audience, on seeing a newsreel of Stalin saluting the Red Army, would have applauded, for that army had taken the brunt of the Nazi onslaught, as most people were aware. Now they would look on with fear or at least bewilderment, for the Russians had become the enemy of mankind, a menace to all that was good. It was the Germans who, with amazing rapidity, were turning good. Could this be real? In the unions, communists and their allies, known as intrepid organisers, were to be shorn of membership and turned out as seditious. Harry Bridges, the idol of west coast longshoremen, whom he had all but single-handedly organised, was subjected to trial after trial to drive him back to his native Australia as an unadmitted communist. Academics, some prominent in their fields, were especially targeted, many forced to retire or fired for disloyalty. Some were communists, some were fellow travellers and, inevitably, a certain number were unaffiliated liberals refusing to sign one of the dozens of humiliating anti-communist pledges being required by terrified college administrations. But it is impossible to convey properly the fears that marked that period. Nobody was shot, to be sure, although some were going to jail, where at least one, William Remington, was murdered by an inmate hoping to shorten his sentence by having killed a communist. Rather than physical fear, it was the sense of impotence, which seemed to deepen with each week, of being unable to speak accurately of the very recent past when being leftwing in America, and for that matter in Europe, was to be alive to the dilemmas of the day. As for the idea of willingly subjecting my work not only to some party's discipline but to anyone's control, my repugnance was such that, as a young and indigent writer, I had turned down lucrative offers to work for Hollywood studios because of a revulsion at the thought of someone owning the paper I was typing on. It was not long, perhaps four or five years, before the fraudulence of Soviet cultural claims was as clear to me as it should have been earlier. But I would never have found it believable, in the 50s or later, that with its thuggish self-righteousness and callous contempt for artists' freedoms, that the Soviet way of controlling culture could be successfully exported to America. Some greatly talented people were driven out of the US to work in England: screenwriters like Carl Foreman and Donald Ogden Stewart, actors like Charlie Chaplin and Sam Wanamaker. I no longer recall the number of our political exiles, but it was more than too many and disgraceful for a nation prideful of its democracy. Writing now, almost half a century later, with the Soviet Union in ruins, China rhetorically fending off capitalism even as in reality it adopts a market economy, Cuba wallowing helplessly in the Caribbean, it is not easy to convey the American fear of a masterful communism. The quickness with which Soviet-style regimes had taken over eastern Europe and China was breathtaking, and I believe it stirred up a fear in Americans of our own ineptitudes, our mystifying inability, despite our military victories, to control the world whose liberties we had so recently won back from the Axis powers. In 1956, the House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) subpoenaed me - I was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to identify writers I had met at one of the two communist writers' meetings I had attended many years before. By then, the tide was going out for Huac and it was finding it more difficult to make front pages. However, the news of my forthcoming marriage to Marilyn Monroe was too tempting to be passed. That our marriage had some connection with my being subpoenaed was confirmed when Chairman Walters of the Huac sent word to Joseph Rauh, my lawyer, that he would be inclined to cancel my hearing if Miss Monroe would consent to have a picture taken with him. The offer having been declined, the good chairman, as my hearing came to an end, entreated me to write less tragically about our country. This lecture cost me $40,000 in lawyer's fees, a year's suspended sentence for contempt of Congress, and a $500 fine. Not to mention about a year of inanition in my creative life. My fictional view of the period, my sense of its unreality had been, like any impotence, a psychologically painful experience. A similar paralysis descended on Salem. In both places, to keep social unity intact, the authority of leaders had to be hardened and words of scepticism toward them constricted. A new cautionary diction, an uncustomary prudence inflected our way of talking to one another. The word socialism was all but taboo. Words had gotten fearsome. As I learned directly in Ann Arbor on a 1953 visit, university students were avoiding renting rooms in houses run by the housing cooperative for fear of being labelled communist, so darkly suggestive was the word cooperative. The head of orientation at the university told me, in a rather cool, uninvolved manner, that the FBI was enlisting professors to report on students voicing leftwing opinions, and - more comedy - that they had also engaged students to report on professors with the same views.

For Mr Chun, although not exactly a celebrity, had earned himself a special place in history as the man who invented the Hawaiian Aloha shirt. This was an unforgivable thing to do, but its importance is undeniable. The Aloha shirt, made of crumpled silk or rayon, and decorated with garish pictures of palm trees, pineapples and hula girls, is probably one of the most offensive garments known to man.

The Aloha shirt did untold damage to the reputation of Americans in Europe, especially when it was worn inside churches and art galleries, but it remained immensely popular at home as a symbol of a leisurely, convivial, easy-going attitude to life. </p> <p>One of its most enthusiastic contemporary advocates is Neil Abercrombie, a Democratic congressman from Hawaii, who calls it \"the ultimate expression of delighted creativity\". \"You can't help feeling good when you're wearing an Aloha shirt,\" he says. \"It makes you feel free and at ease with the world. It's difficult to get upset with people when you're wearing an Aloha shirt.\" That sounds plausible. It is hard to imagine somebody getting road rage in one. </p> <p>When Mr Chun created the first Aloha shirt by combining the styles of the loose checked shirts worn by Hawaiian sugar-plantation workers and the bright silk children's shirts made out of leftover kimono material by Japanese mothers, he wasn't indulging in a flight of fancy.

(\"I am sure he had a good business instinct,\" said his widow, Mildred.) Later in life, he got rid of the clothing shop and embarked on a successful second career as a banker. </p> <p>But his most important legacy has been the lifting of a long taboo against casualness, ostentation and effeminacy in male dress.

It simply isn't done to face backwards, as this is tantamount to an invasion of privacy. If people can't see the back of your head, they won't know you're in front of them. Let's face it, we would never have got off the beaches at Dunkirk if our lads had all been facing different directions. </p> <p>Long queues inch forward, and it is vital that you take every inch when presented with the opportunity to do so. You can't wait until a couple of feet have opened up and then make a big leap forward, because the person behind you will immediately ask, 'Are you in the queue?' by which they mean, 'Don't you even know how to queue properly?' </p> <p>Queues edge forward even when the front isn't going anywhere. When you're in a queue, it's advisable not to lean or tilt forward, because the 300 people behind you will all budge up into the vacant inches and you'll never get them back. </p> <p>There is a hierarchy in queues. Being first in the queue is next to godliness. Being able to see the front of the queue is excellent. Being able to see people who can see the front is not bad. Seeing nothing but queue is not good.

The only thing that'll make you feel better is when some poor loser joins the queue behind you. </p> <p>Some queues get a little bit messy, so much so that, to an outsider, it may not be immediately apparent who is in front. However, every single person in the queue has a mental photo-finish picture of exactly who is where. That's why queue-jumpers are the lowest form of life, as they offend our deep sense of fair play. People who lead crushingly oppressed lives will stand for just about any indignity, but God forbid if any-body should push in a queue in front of them. </p> <p>Queuing is a serious, skilled occupation, and you'll notice that loving couples never claim to have met in a queue.

Allow the same amount of space as you would to dance with your Great Aunt Hildegard at a wedding - leave too much space, and you'll become that horrible chink in the queue through which people pass. If you're in a long queue, you must all look in the same direction. It simply isn't done to face backwards, as this is tantamount to an invasion of privacy. If people can't see the back of your head, they won't know you're in front of them. Let's face it, we would never have got off the beaches at Dunkirk if our lads had all been facing different directions. Long queues inch forward, and it is vital that you take every inch when presented with the opportunity to do so. You can't wait until a couple of feet have opened up and then make a big leap forward, because the person behind you will immediately ask, 'Are you in the queue?' by which they mean, 'Don't you even know how to queue properly?' Queues edge forward even when the front isn't going anywhere. When you're in a queue, it's advisable not to lean or tilt forward, because the 300 people behind you will all budge up into the vacant inches and you'll never get them back. There is a hierarchy in queues. Being first in the queue is next to godliness. Being able to see the front of the queue is excellent. Being able to see people who can see the front is not bad. Seeing nothing but queue is not good. And being at the very back of the queue is dreadful. The only thing that'll make you feel better is when some poor loser joins the queue behind you. Some queues get a little bit messy, so much so that, to an outsider, it may not be immediately apparent who is in front. However, every single person in the queue has a mental photo-finish picture of exactly who is where. That's why queue-jumpers are the lowest form of life, as they offend our deep sense of fair play. People who lead crushingly oppressed lives will stand for just about any indignity, but God forbid if any-body should push in a queue in front of them. Queuing is a serious, skilled occupation, and you'll notice that loving couples never claim to have met in a queue. So, unless you've got a back of the neck to die for, you shouldn't expect to score there, either.",

      "body": "<p>I don't know if you saw The Observer last weekend, but there were the most gorgeous photos in the colour supplement of Will Self, his three children and his wife, the journalist Deborah Orr. Taking a tip from Tony Blair, perhaps, this was a serious re-branding: no more the junkie stud, instead the funky dad. Rugged Will, blonde Debs, sun-kissed boy and girl kiddies, and gorgeous, bouncing baby - they resembled what an advert for Sunny Delight might look like if Sunny Delight decided to aim itself at people who holiday in Kerala and know what \"frottage\" means. </p> <p>I felt there was something odd about these photos, and I kept gazing at them looking for clues. It took two days of puzzling over them before I tumbled: though he looked as certifiably, teeth-grindingly sexy as ever, I was free. For the first time in 10 years, I didn't fancy Will Self! </p> <p>To get the full clout of this, you've got to understand what Will Self represented, sexually, in the 90s. Despite his drug and alcohol intake, to us London media babes he was a sexual icon packing the oomph of Jimi Hendrix, Robbie Williams and Gordon Brown all rolled into one. Every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him. They usually did, too. At one time, I had three different friends whom he slept with for the first time on the same day. To add insult to injury, they all then proceeded to ring me up and tell me that they were having a passionate affair with him, he was The One, it was true love - the whole works. I soon put those bitches right, let me tell you - in a caring way, of course, as Dame Edna would say. </p> <p>So it was horribly vulgar and predictable for me to fall for Will, like saying your favourite film is Casablanca or your favourite Opal Fruit is strawberry. For years, I just looked at him across crowded rooms - you couldn't miss him; he was so tall and prehistoric-looking - until one night he followed my husband and I home, and showed us how to smoke crack. I'll never forget what a thrill it was being bossed about by him - now cut a hole in the Evian bottle, now stick the straw in there; like some depraved Blue Peter presenter - and I'll never forget how he looked when it hit him: slumped on my black leather sofa, with just one big juicy tear coursing down his left cheekbone. I was lost. </p> <p>Sad, sad, sad; I took to calling his home when I knew he was out, just to hear his voice on the answerphone - sometimes, and this is really weird, I'd call his answerphone from my bedroom when he was sitting drinking vodka in my front room. The reality of him seemed too much to grasp; I was happier with the unreal thing. I was so chronically embarrassed by the predictability of my crush that I even took to inventing false crushes to put people off the trail. But I'm sure I didn't convince anyone. It's the name-dropping that does it, I always think. The search-engine of my mind was primed, and from that moment any word typed in, from AZTEC to ZEBRA, would have come up with one answer: WILL SELF. I had a truly amazing capability to turn any subject of conversation around to him - even with my parents, who, of course, didn't know him from Adam. My mum would be talking about the dog's flatulence problem - and I could turn it on a sixpence right round to Will. No problem. </p> <p>After a couple of years, I felt I had to tell someone, so I went to my best friend's school at 10 in the morning, saying that I was her aunt and that there had been a death in the family. I dragged her to the Groucho, and told her everything while she sat there in her school uniform with her mouth open, the two of us looking like some corny Hogarthian print about innocence and corruption, as Jeffrey Bernard told me later. Three hours later, I staggered from the bar into the foyer where I walked slap-bang into Will, who gave me the biggest hug and the saddest smile I've ever seen. Somehow, I walked out the door and round the corner into Old Compton Street, where I fainted, and I'm not the type who faints. When I woke up, I burst into tears. In the taxi on the way home, I realised I was becoming a mentalist. Truly, this is the nearest I think I've ever been to going nuts. </p> <p>So perhaps a life without crushes won't be such a bad thing, and no one can say that it's not about time. I did notice while on holiday with my boyfriend's mum last month that, though the Corsican men were well fit, I wasn't interested in any of them. I thought this was really good of me, and I told Mrs Raven about my lack of reaction, thinking I'd get praise. Instead, she laughed scornfully and said, \"I should hope not, at your age!\" That hurt. So at least I'll be able to do dignified now. But, on the other hand, being a crushee is one of the few ways I can access my essential self, and it's not as if there are so many that I can afford to lose them. </p> <p> I've always had crushes on people, really big bastards of crushes. I still remember the first crush I had, when I was four, on my friend Joy (an unexceptional lump, as I recall, whose miserable aspect chronically contradicted her given name), who I would prevent from leaving my house by lying across the threshold and crying. When I was 10, I had to stop watching Dad's Army because I had crushes on three of them - the spiv, the toff and the virgin - and found it too confusing. One reason I've always enjoyed the prospect of falling in love and getting married is because the dull routine of marriage lends itself so perfectly to the agony of the illicit crush. I got through the sexual side of my first marriage - for six years! - by pretending that my husband was my friend Peter York. And people say I don't have any imagination! For those of you outside the slimy boundaries of Mediaville, who can't conjure up either image, let's just say it was a lot like pretending Arthur Mullard was George Sanders. </p> <p>My second husband was a really popular guy - which was great, because he had loads of friends who I could conceive huge crushes on. And often they had lovely girlfriends, who I could get gay crushes on, too! The Modern Review, my little magazine, provided endless crush fodder in the shape of young would-be writers - most of whom thought I was a stuck-up bitch because I wouldn't speak to them from one year to the next, lest my crush be detected. But still, Will loomed over my second marriage, lurked throughout my very enjoyable six months of lesbianism, and has seen considerable active service in my rich and strange inner life over the years since then. </p> <p>And now? Nothing. I know it's a good thing, growing up, but I shall miss being crushed. Still, like Will himself, I'm taking it one day at a time.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are a few short phrases that can strike fear into the soul. My favourite is \"simple self-assembly required\". Self-assembly of a computer work-station from the cheaper end of the market is such ingenious torture, I'd rather undergo colonic irrigation on a plinth in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>\"Come on, Mum!\" cries Harriet, wielding the drill with the intensity of PMT. \"Don't give up! Pass me that screw!\" That drill she's waving is my very own new one. I am going to take control and assemble myself. It's my Vita Nova. However, have never liked carpentry too near tender young flesh. All that sawing, hammering, hacking. No wonder Jesus grew up a pacifist. \"Be careful!\" I shriek, grabbing the safety instructions (\"Sicherheitshinweise\"). \"Keep children away... Maintain order in your working area... stay alert...\" There are 20 safety instructions, and we are flouting most of them. \"Stop, Harriet! Turn it off!\"</p> <p>Her father should be helping us, but he is downstairs watching cricket. A huge, hot hatred of DIY surges up from my aged loins. Strange how the menopause disinclines one to screwing. But what does Ex-Spouse care? For him, the end of the over transcends The End Of The Ova. Harriet, though once an egg of mine, seems doggedly intent on continuing. I am uneasily aware that she should be completing her project on social change in the 60s, and that the only aspect of the 60s that she has embraced so far is the mini-skirt.</p> <p>\"You must get back to your history homework in a minute!\" I nag.</p> <p>\"Wait, Mum! Locate fittings A and B on panels 5024, 5026, 5020 and 5157... to tighten, simply turn fittings B through half a turn.\"</p> <p>\"Simply!\" I groan. \"That's a bloody joke!\" Coax panels into faint shape of box, but they collapse loudly on to the floor - bare boards, of course - hard, deafening and trendy. Sink down on to what used to be my haunches and plunge into orgy of regret. Why did I ever start on this? The PC was all right as it was, sitting on a little Victorian table. Okay, I did bark my shin on it constantly, it did shake whenever I walked past, but so what? Endure brief urge to chuck PC, chipboard, flimsy plastic whatsits, drills, screws, bits, awls, rawlplugs, and little envelopes of glue right out of the window.</p> <p>\"What does it say next?\" ponders Harriet. \"Push the draw runners into the pre-drilled holes.\"</p> <p>\"The what?\" I grab the paper. \"The draw? It's a drawer, for God's sake! Bloody illiterates!\"</p> <p>\"Oh, shut up, Mum - it looks really good.\" Harriet steps back on to the little envelope of glue, which, of course, spurts.</p> <p>Since the self-assembly will clearly take forever, I decide we must discuss social change in the 60s as we go along.</p> <p>\"The cold war was the worst thing,\" I recall.</p> <p>\"What's the cold war?\" asks Harriet, intrigued - for it sounds like some zany new ice-cream experience.</p> <p>\"You mean you've never heard of it?\" She shakes her head. \"When I was your age,\" I recollect, searching the while for screw A, \"the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US were pointed at each other and the world was within minutes of meltdown. In Cuba...\"</p> <p>\"Cuba?\"</p> <p>Cuba possibly now a chocolate bar or brand of self-assembly furniture. \"An island, not far from Florida - well, there were these missiles - Russia was sending shipments of missiles - my parents took us to Aberystwyth and we sat in the car on the sea front, listening to the news and wondering if we were going to be blown to smithereens. I was your age, and I remember thinking, I'm too young to die. I want to fall in love and have a baby.\"</p> <p>Ex-Spouse puts his head round the door. \"Shall we have a cup of tea?\" It must be the tea interval, then. He is hoping I will make it for him. Still expecting the traditional wifely role, even though he hasn't lifted a finger to help us with the DIY. Never mind! I flee from the wretched chipboard monstrosity. Tea, yes sir! Bread and butter, willingly! Compared with the glorious dreams on the seafront at Aberystwyth, my life has turned out to be something of a botched-together chipboard monstrosity, but who cares? At least I can boil a kettle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are a few short phrases that can strike fear into the soul. My favourite is \"simple self-assembly required\". Self-assembly of a computer work-station from the cheaper end of the market is such ingenious torture, I'd rather undergo colonic irrigation on a plinth in Trafalgar Square. \"Come on, Mum!\" cries Harriet, wielding the drill with the intensity of PMT. \"Don't give up! Pass me that screw!\" That drill she's waving is my very own new one. I am going to take control and assemble myself. It's my Vita Nova. However, have never liked carpentry too near tender young flesh. All that sawing, hammering, hacking. No wonder Jesus grew up a pacifist. \"Be careful!\" I shriek, grabbing the safety instructions (\"Sicherheitshinweise\"). \"Keep children away... Maintain order in your working area... stay alert...\" There are 20 safety instructions, and we are flouting most of them. \"Stop, Harriet! Turn it off!\" Her father should be helping us, but he is downstairs watching cricket. A huge, hot hatred of DIY surges up from my aged loins. Strange how the menopause disinclines one to screwing. But what does Ex-Spouse care? For him, the end of the over transcends The End Of The Ova. Harriet, though once an egg of mine, seems doggedly intent on continuing. I am uneasily aware that she should be completing her project on social change in the 60s, and that the only aspect of the 60s that she has embraced so far is the mini-skirt. \"You must get back to your history homework in a minute!\" I nag. \"Wait, Mum! Locate fittings A and B on panels 5024, 5026, 5020 and 5157... to tighten, simply turn fittings B through half a turn.\" \"Simply!\" I groan. \"That's a bloody joke!\" Coax panels into faint shape of box, but they collapse loudly on to the floor - bare boards, of course - hard, deafening and trendy. Sink down on to what used to be my haunches and plunge into orgy of regret. Why did I ever start on this? The PC was all right as it was, sitting on a little Victorian table. Okay, I did bark my shin on it constantly, it did shake whenever I walked past, but so what? Endure brief urge to chuck PC, chipboard, flimsy plastic whatsits, drills, screws, bits, awls, rawlplugs, and little envelopes of glue right out of the window. \"What does it say next?\" ponders Harriet. \"Push the draw runners into the pre-drilled holes.\" \"The what?\" I grab the paper. \"The draw? It's a drawer, for God's sake! Bloody illiterates!\" \"Oh, shut up, Mum - it looks really good.\" Harriet steps back on to the little envelope of glue, which, of course, spurts. Since the self-assembly will clearly take forever, I decide we must discuss social change in the 60s as we go along. \"The cold war was the worst thing,\" I recall. \"What's the cold war?\" asks Harriet, intrigued - for it sounds like some zany new ice-cream experience. \"You mean you've never heard of it?\" She shakes her head. \"When I was your age,\" I recollect, searching the while for screw A, \"the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US were pointed at each other and the world was within minutes of meltdown. In Cuba...\" \"Cuba?\" Cuba possibly now a chocolate bar or brand of self-assembly furniture. \"An island, not far from Florida - well, there were these missiles - Russia was sending shipments of missiles - my parents took us to Aberystwyth and we sat in the car on the sea front, listening to the news and wondering if we were going to be blown to smithereens. I was your age, and I remember thinking, I'm too young to die. I want to fall in love and have a baby.\" Ex-Spouse puts his head round the door. \"Shall we have a cup of tea?\" It must be the tea interval, then. He is hoping I will make it for him. Still expecting the traditional wifely role, even though he hasn't lifted a finger to help us with the DIY. Never mind! I flee from the wretched chipboard monstrosity. Tea, yes sir! Bread and butter, willingly! Compared with the glorious dreams on the seafront at Aberystwyth, my life has turned out to be something of a botched-together chipboard monstrosity, but who cares? At least I can boil a kettle.",

The Tesco's Coonawarra (16 points, out of 20, \u00a36.99) is an exceedingly elegant example, offering exceptional balance with refined yet deliciously crunchy tannins. Tesco's non- vintage Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon (16 points, \u00a33.99), on the other hand, parades chocolate with raspberry, a hint of earth and a flourish of blackcurrant - and that's just the climax. And Tesco's Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99) is compellingly teasing with its hint of coffee and cream to the blackcurrant richness of the fruit, while Tesco's Chilean Merlot Reserve 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99) has that give-away leathery softness of merlot plus a savoury undertone. </p> <p>Tesco also has a marvellous pinot noir from Chile, but it is not an own-label wine: it is Cono Sur Pinot Noir 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99), and what a racy, rich, stylish, thorny wine it is, with typical, heart-warming, Chilean extra-richness and a texture that is unusual, but deliciously welcome, in a pinot. This wine is also at Asda and Somerfield. I daresay it is the best pinot it is possible to salivate over for less than a fiver - it has more excitement and considerably more textured energy than many a much-vaunted, pricier Burgundy </p> <p>At the CWS, there is an interesting bunch of wines on special offer until July 2. Vin de Pays d'Oc Syrah/ Malbec is a non-vintage Co-Op own-label wine. On offer at \u00a33.29, it is juicy yet characterful.

Marques de Grinon Malbec 1997, a compellingly quaffable tippling from Argentina, has soupy, spicy, graduated fruit that develops on the tastebuds with lingering finesse. On offer at \u00a34.99, it rates 16 points. Star Mountain Touriga Nacional 1997, from Portugal, has invigorating tannins with ripe, raw, plummy fruit.

The Aussie has restrained richness and dry fruit, and is not only rather refined for the price but absurd. Cynics will suspect (as will snobs and know-alls) that many corners have been cut to turn out a chardonnay such as this for such a measly sum, but I can only say suck it and see. The Cape wine, to be found at Co-Op Superstores only, is more concentrated and more complex, offering, as it does, hints of woodsmoke, oak, yoghurt and fresh, under-ripe melon.

But, while the white sand will undoubtedly create a lasting impression on anyone who makes the journey, the fine contemporary beachside architecture will do much the same - as long as you take the time occasionally to glance in your rear-view mirror or up towards the embankments above as you make your way to the beach. For, nestled in the scrub or perched above the road, you will find some remarkable beach houses that bring new meaning to the term \"beach shack\".</p> <p>Take the small beach-side resort of Somers, for example, on the Mornington Peninsula of Victoria. There, among the traditional homes with white picket fences, is one such beach house, designed by the architects Robinson Chen. What sets it apart, first and foremost, is that the front facade, with its deep-charcoal angled walls, lacks any of the usual features we associate with a house - there are no windows or doors. But then, says Kai Chen, \"when you're designing a beach house or weekender, there simply aren't as many rituals that have to be followed. The kitchen can be much simpler, the laundry more minimal, you need fewer wardrobes, and there is less pressure on facilities in general. The spatial issues, and capturing the special qualities of the site, become more important.\"</p> <p>Yet, while a house that is so at odds with its neighbours might be cause for concern in the city, on the beach everyone enjoys the novelty it brings to the street. \"Occasionally, we get the odd bloke driving past who screams out his opinion, but the house generally brings a smile to those who pass by,\" says Denis Hildebrand, who owns the house with his wife, Janice. \"Great design will stand on its own two feet, and will complement the surrounding buildings, whether they're located in the city or along the coast.\"</p> <p>Further around the Mornington Peninsula, there is another house that shouldn't be missed: designed by architects McBride Charles Ryan, it is constructed from Mount Gambier limestone, and designed over three levels: the lower tier provides space for guests, the middle encompasses the living areas, and the top floor is given over to the leisure areas.</p> <p>The core of the house is the spine-like staircase that follows the building's curvilinear form. \"The stairs are one of the most important aspects of the home,\" says its architect, Rob McBride. \"Two-thirds the gradient of the usual rise, one has the feeling of simply gliding into the next level, rather than being aware of climbing.\"</p> <p>The entrance to the house, with its full-length porthole window, is as transparent as the steel front-gates to the property, which are also punctuated with portholes. The storage and display unit on the middle level, constructed from spotted gum, cuts a swathe across the room and echoes the lines of the bay. \"The kitchen could be read as a large chopping block,\" says Debbie-Lyn Ryan, the practice's interior designer, \"but it can also be seen as the layers of wood that have developed over time in the trunk of a tree.\"</p> <p>Further north, at Palm Beach in New South Wales, the coastline hides many similar gems. One house, designed by architect Alex Popov, is connected to an existing house on a steep site. The new three-storey home - designed around a central void, with a dramatic pyramidal skylight - is cleverly nestled under the roof of the original residence, and features a roof-top observation deck. \"The weekender is usually a much lighter building than the permanent residence in the city,\" explains Popov, \"so it's also not as formal as the city abode.\"</p> <p>While the structure can be far more relaxed by the beach, however, \"one 'loose room' isn't enough\", says Popov. \"Many of my clients expect the larger bedrooms in the beach house, and many of the features that would be appropriate for eventual retirement.\"</p> <p>This sense of \"lightness\" is one of the hallmarks of Queensland architects Gabriel and Elizabeth Poole, who are mindful of the change in attitude between city and beach. \"Clients usually leave the fortress mentality behind when they head towards the beach,\" says Gabriel Poole. \"It's a chance for them to have some fun with architecture. We try and introduce some of these more playful aspects into their city abodes. I think that, when they come to the beach, they have a freer spirit, and the outside walls disappear.\"</p> <p>The Pasternak House, on Queensland's Sunshine Beach, characterises the Pooles' lighter approach. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the three-storey building nestles into a sloping site, so that the generous space within emerges only once you pass through the front door. The steel stairway not only creates a transparency inside the home, but echoes the shape of the horizontal glass louvres that provide essential ventilation in this tropical environment. Likewise, the playful geometric shapes, such as those that frame the window on the top level, are as functional as they are aesthetic.</p> <p>In contrast to the strong geometric feel of the Pasternak house is the smaller yet equally impressive Mooloomba House on North Stradbroke Island, off the south-east Queensland coast. Here, the architects Peter O'Gorman and Brit Andresen have built a beach house that challenges the normal parameters of architecture.</p> <p>According to Andresen, they had two key design requirements: \"One was to fix its location in the landscape by designing as much as possible of its small site as outdoor rooms. The other was to explore the use of local hardwoods in domestic buildings in Queensland.\" They eventually decided on hardwoods as part of a stud-framed system, with 18mm waterproof ply sandwiched in between.</p> <p>The result is a house that is delicately woven together within the larger context of its site and surrounds. Rather than the standard house, which appears to be rigorously controlled and manipulated, this home's major appeal is the very informality of its construction.</p> <p>The Moolomba House, like all of these homes, shows that the once-humble beach house may just be the voice needed to steer our architecture in a new, freer direction, not least as city architecture is more often than not forced to conform to existing structures. One thing's for sure: they all guarantee that you'll never think of a beach shack in the same way again</p> <p>\u0095 Beach Houses of Australia and New Zealand, by Stephen Crafti, is published next month by Images Publishing Group Ltd, priced \u00a335.</p>",

The storage and display unit on the middle level, constructed from spotted gum, cuts a swathe across the room and echoes the lines of the bay. \"The kitchen could be read as a large chopping block,\" says Debbie-Lyn Ryan, the practice's interior designer, \"but it can also be seen as the layers of wood that have developed over time in the trunk of a tree.\" Further north, at Palm Beach in New South Wales, the coastline hides many similar gems. One house, designed by architect Alex Popov, is connected to an existing house on a steep site. The new three-storey home - designed around a central void, with a dramatic pyramidal skylight - is cleverly nestled under the roof of the original residence, and features a roof-top observation deck. \"The weekender is usually a much lighter building than the permanent residence in the city,\" explains Popov, \"so it's also not as formal as the city abode.\" While the structure can be far more relaxed by the beach, however, \"one 'loose room' isn't enough\", says Popov. \"Many of my clients expect the larger bedrooms in the beach house, and many of the features that would be appropriate for eventual retirement.\" This sense of \"lightness\" is one of the hallmarks of Queensland architects Gabriel and Elizabeth Poole, who are mindful of the change in attitude between city and beach. \"Clients usually leave the fortress mentality behind when they head towards the beach,\" says Gabriel Poole. \"It's a chance for them to have some fun with architecture. We try and introduce some of these more playful aspects into their city abodes. I think that, when they come to the beach, they have a freer spirit, and the outside walls disappear.\" The Pasternak House, on Queensland's Sunshine Beach, characterises the Pooles' lighter approach. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the three-storey building nestles into a sloping site, so that the generous space within emerges only once you pass through the front door. The steel stairway not only creates a transparency inside the home, but echoes the shape of the horizontal glass louvres that provide essential ventilation in this tropical environment. Likewise, the playful geometric shapes, such as those that frame the window on the top level, are as functional as they are aesthetic. In contrast to the strong geometric feel of the Pasternak house is the smaller yet equally impressive Mooloomba House on North Stradbroke Island, off the south-east Queensland coast. Here, the architects Peter O'Gorman and Brit Andresen have built a beach house that challenges the normal parameters of architecture. According to Andresen, they had two key design requirements: \"One was to fix its location in the landscape by designing as much as possible of its small site as outdoor rooms. The other was to explore the use of local hardwoods in domestic buildings in Queensland.\" They eventually decided on hardwoods as part of a stud-framed system, with 18mm waterproof ply sandwiched in between. The result is a house that is delicately woven together within the larger context of its site and surrounds. Rather than the standard house, which appears to be rigorously controlled and manipulated, this home's major appeal is the very informality of its construction. The Moolomba House, like all of these homes, shows that the once-humble beach house may just be the voice needed to steer our architecture in a new, freer direction, not least as city architecture is more often than not forced to conform to existing structures. One thing's for sure: they all guarantee that you'll never think of a beach shack in the same way again \u0095 Beach Houses of Australia and New Zealand, by Stephen Crafti, is published next month by Images Publishing Group Ltd, priced \u00a335.",

Alan Davidson, in his majestic Oxford Companion To Food, names a Mrs Clements of Tewkesbury in 1720 as the first to dry mustard seeds and then mill them into a powder; and reveals the inspiration for the phrase \"as keen as mustard\" as being a famous brand of mustard made by Keen &amp; Sons of London.</p> <p>Today, it is the mustard of Dijon - the strongest and most pure in flavour of all French mustards (the mildest being the seed mustard from Meaux, which is sold in those distinctive pots plugged with a cork and sealed with red wax) - that receives such plaudits.

This reaction is difficult to explain, as mustard loses its heat dramatically when cooked.

This delight is made by crystallising whole fruits in a sugar syrup that has been made fiery with mustard essence, and the end-result is not only quite gorgeous to look at, but fantastic to eat with all manner of cold meats and cured sausages.

Now whisk in the mustard and, when the mixture is smooth, pour in the oils in a fine, steady stream. Only dress the salad immediately before serving, giving the dressing another whisk before doing so.</p> <p><b> To devil a chicken</b></p> <p><b>6 little chickens (poussin or coquelet), spatchcocked</b></p> <p><b>100g unsalted butter</b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and freshly-milled black pepper</b></p> <p><b>110g unsalted butter</b></p> <p><b>2 very generous tbsp Dijon mustard</b></p> <p><b>2 big handfuls picked flat-leaf parsley</b></p> <p><b>3 cloves garlic</b></p> <p><b>70g fresh white breadcrumbs</b></p> <p><b>Juice of lemon</b></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Lay the birds breast-side up and smear them with 100g butter, then move to a roasting pan. Season with sea salt and freshly-milled black pepper and place in the oven. Cook for 10-12 minutes and, when beginning to brown and the birds are almost cooked, reduce the temperature to 175C/350F/gas mark 4 for a further five minutes or so.</p> <p>In a heavy frying pan, melt the rest of the butter, add the peeled cloves of garlic then pour into a liquidiser, along with the parsley. Remove the tray of roasting birds from the oven and drain off all the juices that have collected in the bottom of the tray. Spoon off the excess fat, then pour the cooking juices into the liquidiser.</p> <p>Turn on the liquidiser to slow, and start to pulverise the parsley.

      "body": "<p>We'd been going to Glastonbury as visitors for five or six years, so when we were first asked to play in 1997 we were really excited. What I love about Glastonbury is wandering around and seeing all the strange people. It's a wonderful place, a great feeling. There's something about it that makes it peculiarly British - it attracts a real cross-section, from the cool London music types in their flashy Winnebagoes to the people who bunk over the fence and sleep in a hedge.</p> <p>People go for different reasons: to see the comedy, or the bands, or just to hang out. There are new-ager parents with their children having an enlightening weekend by the acoustic world music tent; the odd Scrumpy lout (you never really see any lager louts, as such). I love the fact that Glastonbury is not at all organised, so you'll see loads of impromptu sound systems that have just sprung up out of nowhere, or you'll see someone just dancing in front of a hot-dog stand or a rug seller - did I say rug seller?</p> <p>Outside the main festival area, you come across even more eccentric people. One year, a friend of ours, Nick, who's a drummer in a band, wandered out to a stone circle where a group of new agers were sitting around in a kind of trance, beating out polyrhythmic patterns on their drums. He asked if he could join in, and they lent him a drum. After a while, they stopped for a break, and Nick asked them, \"Do you recognise this?\", and started beating out the theme tune of Only Fools And Horses. There was a look of complete incomprehension on everyone's faces - they'd obviously not been out into mainstream society for a while. Then, suddenly, a girl recognised it; she'd remembered it from the days before she'd opted out. They'd clearly been out of the loop for quite some time.</p> <p>Glastonbury is not like the Reading Festival. There's something different about it; it's not sanitised. It's not like the bands are just wheeled on and wheeled off again. A good festival is not just about buying in a load of acts that you think will go together.</p> <p>With Glastonbury, you get the feeling that there are minds at work behind it. There's an idea, and the line-up is always very varied, which is down to the organiser, Michael Eavis. It's diverse. I love the fact that Glastonbury just keeps going all night, whereas at some festivals the site has to be cleared at midnight. And the location is brilliant. The Pheonix Festival used to be in the middle of an industrial airfield outside Birmingham, which always felt a bit artificial.</p> <p>But Glastonbury is so beautiful, with all those rolling hills - it feels wilder, somehow. We've played lots of festivals, and the nearest in spirit is the Fuji Festival in Japan - the scale of it, the different kinds of bands playing, and the amazing location. There are other festivals that come close. The festival near Valencia is on the beach, and they always have a nice line-up - and go-karting. We play there every year - we're like their mascot. The Lollipop Festival in Sweden is in the middle of a forest by a huge lake. I think it matters where you are, that you're outside your normal existence, and living a different experience for a few days. Last year, we played at Woodstock, which is absolutely huge, with the stages about three miles apart. We were playing on the \"New Metal\" stage, with bands like Limp Biscuit.</p> <p>We went along to Glastonbury as punters in 1993 and 1994, and Orbital were playing on the second stage. It was the most amazing night, and it was the first time that a dance band was allowed to finish off the show. Live techno, outdoors, is the most brilliant experience - dancing under the stars with music wafting around the open air. After we'd experienced that, it was a real thrill to be invited to play ourselves. It's the perfect festival, a thrill to play, and always a good crowd. In 1997, we played on the second outdoor stage, and two years after that we deejayed in the dance tent - the energy and excitement was manic.</p> <p>We've always found that, even if the rest of the festival is gloomy and rainy, the dance tent is the most vibrant place, and they're expanding the dance area this year - there's going to be a new outdoor area called the Glade. The Summer of Love has definitely influenced the festival - six years ago, a huge number of techno sound systems started cropping up around the site.</p> <p>The reason it works so well at Glastonbury is because dance music is a social kind of music. You go with your friends to the dance tent, and you feel like you're joining together with other people. It's not just a receptive thing of watching - when you're together, it's a communal feeling. You're not just accepting the received wisdom of some rock gods. It replicates that feeling of when you first started going to raves.</p> <p>People may complain about the mud, but you just have to get used to it and accept that it's a different way of operating for a few days. One year Ed [Simons, fellow Chemical brother] got trench foot - that was pretty bad. We had stayed on after we'd played, and he was wearing trainers all weekend - it was very muddy that year. My worst experience of Glastonbury happened one year when Ed and I were there as punters, and we were sharing a tent. We hadn't realised how hot it was, and we woke up at 2pm burning hot and with heat stroke.</p> <p>Headlining on the main stage is a slightly scary proposition, and it'll be the first time in England that we've played to that many people, though at Woodstock we played to about 80,000 and we deejayed after Bowie in Europe to 60,000.</p> <p>We'll be very different from the other acts playing on the main stage, [they include Travis and David Bowie], but we're not changing what we do - we just play our music how we play our music. It'll be a kind of son et lumi\u00e8re experience. We'll play Hey Boy Hey Girl to kick off the set, a kind of rallying call. The closest experience I have to compare to how it might be is when we played on the second stage in 1997 - looking up and seeing all those people, and up on the hillside the camp fires burning. It was an amazing feeling</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Rowlands was talking to Lindsay Baker. Glastonbury Festival is from June 23-25. There are 11 stages of music.

A vast medical experiment carried out by men on women. A saviour. A killer. An economic liberator. A device described by the Economist as possibly the single most defining invention of the 20th century, and by others as nothing more than a four-letter word. No other drug in the history of medicine has been so examined, caused more enthusiasm, fright and fury. The name itself seems loaded with significance. Singular, mysteriously capitalised: of all the tablets and potions we take, this is the Pill.</p> <p>Of the 11 million women of reproductive age in the UK, an estimated three million are on the Pill. To users of the drug, the little rattling packet is as familiar as their toothbrush. A series of innocuous pastel pellets lying in rows or arranged like flower petals around a plastic disc. Sufficiently large to be felt on the tongue, tiny enough to cause a moment of panic if accidentally dropped. Each in its allotted place, marked by the day of the week; charting, by slow degrees, the months and years of a woman's reproductive life.</p> <p>Familiar as the Pill is, however, an uneasiness with it remains, a lurking fear that it must carry with it some dangerous catch. But the Pill a woman takes today is not the same as the one her mother took. It is far safer. It also has the power to protect against certain deadly diseases. In ways that the drug's inventors could not have anticipated, the Pill has benefits that go far beyond simple birth control. Put simply, it can save your life. And the reason it can do this is perhaps one of the greatest medical ironies of the 20th century.</p> <p>From the start, the very idea of the Pill was troublesome. To give a drug every single day for years to a large, perfectly healthy population of young women seemed to go against most people's notions of how - and why - drugs should be used. The majority of women do not take the Pill to ward off life-threatening disorders, or to alleviate pain, or to control unpleasant symptoms caused by unavoidable disease. They don't even take it - primarily, at least - simply to avoid pregnancy. The truth is that most women take the Pill because they wish to have sex. Sex without worry, without the fuss and uncertainty of condoms and diaphragms.</p> <p>The concept of sex without worry took a serious blow, of course, with the arrival of Aids, but women in monogamous relationships still take the Pill so that they can enjoy a sexual freedom unknown to previous generations. It's hardly surprising that the drug has always inspired a mixture of love and loathing. Carl Djerassi, the chemist who first synthesised a steroid oral contraceptive in 1951 and who is sometimes described as \"the father\" of the Pill, also links our ambivalence towards the drug to the era in which it was first introduced to society: \"In the mid- to late 60s, the three most important social movements were the women's movement, the rise of environmental protectionism and consumer advocacy. All were immensely beneficial, but all were, to some extent, suspicious of technology, almost anti-science.\"</p> <p>But although the Pill became one of the symbols of the 60s, its creation was influenced far more by the cultural concerns of the previous decade. When it was invented, the Pill was designed to be taken in a cycle consisting of three pill-taking weeks, followed by seven \"free\" days to allow a woman an episode of bleeding that corresponded to normal menstruation. This is still the method used today. But few Pill-users know that there is no real medical justification for taking it this way. In theory, the drug might have been designed to free women from the obligation of having a period every single month. The decision to create a method of birth control that mimicked women's normal menstrual cycles was based on a patronising assumption - that women wanted to continue having periods every single month. That it was comforting to them. That there was, in short, a need to bleed.</p> <p>The idea that menstruation is valuable has a long pedigree. The \"father of medicine\", Hippocrates himself, gave his opinion that it was desirable. Not fully understanding how a woman's monthly cycle worked, he observed that the onset of menstruation seemed to alleviate the headaches and tension experienced in the days leading up to the release of blood, and therefore concluded it was important. It's been suggested that the habit of bloodletting for both men and women that dominated the practice of medicine up until the 20th century was inspired by the so-called beneficial effects of menstruation. By the time the Pill came to be created, such beliefs had, of course, been discredited, but the idea that a monthly period was normal and healthy persisted. It also happened to fit nicely with the concerns of one of the Pill's inventors.</p> <p>The Pill was developed by a team of scientists, of whom the leading figures were Carl Djerassi, biologist Gregory Pincus, who demonstrated the drug's efficacy on animals, and Harvard-based gynaecologist John Rock, who conducted the clinical trials on humans. The journalist Malcolm Gladwell, writing in the New Yorker, suggests that the form the Pill took, right from the start, was influenced, to a large degree, by Rock's belief that the drug was a \"natural\" form of birth control. The Pill contains synthetic versions of two naturally-occurring hormones, progesterone and oestrogen. Under normal circumstances, the levels of these hormones fluctuate throughout a woman's menstrual cycle, resulting in the release of an egg from the ovary and the growth of the uterine lining in preparation for the fertilised egg. On the Pill, however, the hormones are given in a steady dose, preventing ovulation from occurring. To Rock, what was natural about the Pill was that it did not introduce anything into a woman's body that didn't already exist there, albeit in a more intermittent fashion.</p> <p>To many, these arguments over the relative \"naturalness\" of the Pill might seem little more than a matter of semantics. To Rock, however, the question was a critical one because, as an ardent Catholic, he passionately wanted the Catholic Church to approve of his invention (it never has). The decision to create the Pill around a monthly cycle that would mimic a woman's natural menstrual pattern belonged, in part, to the same impulse. The less disruptive the Pill appeared, the more acceptable to women and the Church.</p> <p>Djerassi, however, downplays the role of the Catholic Church in the Pill's genesis. \"Having a monthly cycle was normal and reassuring,\" he says. \"To women, regular periods meant not being pregnant. It still does.\" There's another reason, too, why continuing to have monthly bleeding might seem important to women. Periods are associated with fertility, with femininity itself. Girls of 12, 13 or 14, faced with their first period, are commonly reassured by their mothers that it means that they are now \"women\". The (surely unintended) implication being that, once those periods end, the girl will - by some unhappy transformation - be a woman no longer.</p> <p>Hadine Joffe, a reproductive psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School who specialises in the effects of hormones in the brain, finds that taking the Pill continuously (ie, without the usual monthly breaks) can be beneficial for some patients. These are women with severe mood disorders that worsen around the time of their period and that don't respond to other treatments. \"The question they ask is: 'Will I still be fertile when I come off the Pill?' \" says Joffe. \"Women associate a lack of periods with menopause.\" Whether the bleeding occurs through natural menstruation or being on the Pill, it remains a potent sign to women that they still have reproductive potential.</p> <p>But there's no reason to suppose that, given enough information, many women on the Pill would not prefer to have fewer periods. Although it does lighten monthly bleeding and helps alleviate many of the symptoms of normal menstruation, it does not eliminate them. Patricia Sulak, a medical researcher at Texas A&amp;M University, recently published a paper in the US journal, Obstetrics And Gynecology, that evaluated the physical cost of monthly bleeding for women on the Pill.</p> <p>In the dry jargon of academic medicine, the study \"confirmed significant symtomatology during the hormone-free interval, including headaches, pain, breast tenderness, and bloating or swelling\". Add to that the cost of tampons and towels, the loss of working hours from debilitation, and the sheer nuisance of bleeding for one week every month, and one has to wonder why women were denied the option of choosing fewer bleeding intervals when the Pill first came out. Nor why it is not widely known that such an option exists.</p> <p>It seems that, for all the vast research focused on the Pill, there is still a gap. We know a great deal about the safety of taking the drug in its current three-weeks-on, one-week-off form, but there has been little investigation into how many, or how few, periods of bleeding are actually necessary. Regardless of the discomfort and cost of bleeding every month, such research appears to have been given little priority. Studies have shown that blood lipid levels, as well as certain relevant clotting factors, tend to return to normal during the pill-free week, suggesting that the safety of the Pill may be enhanced by regular breaks, but whether such breaks are needed every single month is still unknown. John Guillebaud, professor of family planning and reproductive health at University College, London, and author of The Pill (OUP, fifth ed 1997) confirms that the pattern of having 13 breaks a year (the current norm for Pill-takers) is \"amazingly safe, healthwise\", but suggests that fewer might also be safe. \"Tri-cycling - which is three or four packets in a row followed, by the seven-day break - might be a reasonable compromise. It gives just four or five annoying bleeds per year, yet at least some breaks.\"</p> <p>The great irony is that, in the years since the Pill was invented, what used to seem normal and \"natural\" is revealing itself to be just the opposite. John Rock thought he was maintaining a status quo by allowing women their monthly period. What he did not know was that later research would fundamentally challenge this status quo. For while it is true that modern women are used to menstruating once a month, the same cannot be said of their ancestors. It now appears that far from being natural, constant menstruation is an abnormality in evolutionary terms.</p> <p>During the 80s, scientist Beverly Strassmann studied the reproductive life of women in the Dogon, an African tribe whose lifestyle had remained largely unchanged since antiquity. She wanted to form a picture of what women's biological patterns might have been like before the advent of modernity. What she discovered was that Dogon women spent most of their fertile years either pregnant or breastfeeding, both of which suppressed their ovulation for long periods of time. As a result, they only experienced, on average, 100 menstrual periods before they reached menopause. By contrast, the average contemporary woman in the West has between 300 and 400 periods.</p> <p>This phenomenon is relatively recent. Only a few generations ago, it was normal for women to spend much of their reproductive life giving birth to children. But in the West today, the fertilisation of an egg is a far more rare occurrence in an individual's life. Of the 5,000 eggs present in the ovaries at birth, an estimated 10 are fertilised and, of these, on average, only one, two or three result in a complete pregnancy. The rest of the time, eggs are released through ovulation and discarded. Women's lifestyles and expectations may have changed, but it's now thought that our bodies were simply not designed by evolution to handle such frequent ovulation.</p> <p>A growing number of experts in contraception is now questioning whether continuous menstruation is necessary or even advisable. \"It is simplicity itself to eliminate menstruation with safe, inexpensive and widely used oral contraceptive tablets,\" states a recent essay by Sarah Thomas and Charlotte Ellertson in The Lancet. \"Yet monthly menses continue to be the standard for women. Why?\" Contraception researchers Elsimar Coutinho and Sheldon Segal, both leaders in their field, make a bold argument for doing away with constant menstruation altogether in their book, Is Menstruation Obsolete? (OUP, 1999). \"Recurrent menstruation is unnecessary,\" they state, \"and can be harmful to the health of women. It is a needless loss of blood.\"</p> <p>Because the Pill suppresses ovulation, it reduces the number of menstrual episodes in a woman's life. The joke is that, although it was designed to maintain monthly bleeding (without ovulation) for the sake of perceived \"normality\", the drug is, in fact, only normal - in evolutionary terms, at least - for it represses true menstruation. It could be argued, therefore, that, in some ways, being on the Pill is more natural than the constant menstruation experienced by modern women who do not take the drug. And not ovulating all the time carries some important health benefits.</p> <p>The division and reproduction of cells necessitated by ovulation and the growth of a woman's uterine lining increases the risk of ovarian and womb cancers. By lessening the frequency of that cell activity, the Pill increases a women's chances of avoiding these diseases. The advantages are significant. A woman who takes the Pill for 10 years reduces her risk of getting cancer of the womb by about 60%, and her risk of ovarian cancer by around 70%. These benefits of the Pill have been known about for decades, but they remain among the most unsung of the drug's side-effects.</p> <p>Meanwhile, health scares surrounding the Pill continue to make headlines. When the drug first came out, concerns over its safety proved justified. Serious and even fatal complications occurred among users, prompting more research. Since then, hormone doses in the Pill have been drastically reduced. Today, there is only one hundredth the amount of oestrogen that was in the original. Other modifications have added to its safety. During the 80s, a triphasic version of the drug was introduced, providing three different levels of hormone to be taken over the course of a month and corresponding more closely to a woman's natural cycle. Despite the safety of the new Pill, however, fears persist.</p> <p>In the mid-90s a link was suggested between the third-generation Pill and deep-vein thrombosis. Much was made of the fact that women taking this version had double the chances of death over users of the second-generation Pill. \"In 1995, a lot of women were frightened enough to stop taking the Pill altogether,\" says Sheila Hancock, a nurse at Marie Stopes who has been working in family planning since 1977. \"We saw more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions. We stopped using the third-generation pills for a while, and then the GMC okayed them again.\"</p> <p>A doubling of risk sounds terrifying enough, but what was the actual number of deaths being doubled? On the safer Pill, there were two deaths per million women per year. On the third-generation version, four deaths per million. \"Anybody who drives on the roads for a single hour per year increases their risk of death to one in a million,\" claims Professor Guillebaud. \"The difference in risk between the two brands of Pill is the same as going from two hours of driving per year to four.\"</p> <p>Recently, a suggested link between the Pill and breast cancer has been causing debate, and here the risks appear less clear-cut. At the moment, there's no hard evidence that the drug definitely increases a woman's chances of developing the disease. But it might. \"The bottom line,\" says Guillebaud, \"is that the Pill appears to be a weak co-factor in breast cancer. It's probably not the cause. If someone has early cancerous changes to the breast, the Pill can move it along.\"</p> <p>The good news is that, once you stop taking the Pill, your risk for breast cancer is unaffected by your former use of the drug. \"Ten years after taking the Pill, your risk goes back to what it would have been had you never taken it,\" says Guillebaud. He also points out that the time most women take the Pill - during their 20s and early 30s - are the years in which breast cancer is least likely to occur in a woman's life. \"Think of a room of 1,000 women,\" he says. \"All of them took the Pill for 20 years. Now aged 45, they are all ex-users who have not used the drug for 10 years. Eleven women in that room will have breast cancer. In a room of 1,000 women who have never taken the Pill, 10 will have breast cancer.\"</p> <p>Although there may be a small increased risk of breast cancer associated with the drug, it is offset by the Pill's protection against different forms of cancer. So, in the lottery of cancer as a whole, Pill-users may not be any better - or worse - off than anybody else.</p> <p>No one is denying that there are drawbacks to the Pill. Side-effects include an increased risk of blood clots, stroke and heart attack, and it can cause headaches, depression, nausea and skin problems. But all drugs have the potential for bad side-effects. Carl Djerassi tells the story of a talk he once gave, in which he described the risks associated with a certain unnamed medication. This drug, he said, sometimes caused gastro-intestinal distress, bleeding in the stomach and, very occasionally, a life-threatening allergic reaction. Given all this information, he asked his audience, would you still take the drug? They said they would have to think carefully before taking the medication. Their need for the drug would have to be high enough to merit such a risk. The name of the offending substance? Aspirin.</p> <p>\"People want the ideal contraceptive,\" states Djerassi. \"They want something 100% safe without any side-effects. Well, there's no such thing. It's simply not universally possible.\"</p> <p>So why, after four decades of its use, is the Pill still demonised? Why do the fears persist out of all proportion to actual risk? \"When I'm counselling women about whether they should take the Pill,\" says Sheila Hancock, \"my goal is to give them all the information to date and let them decide. But most of the women I see have far more knowledge about the negative aspects of the drug. Very few know about the cancer benefits. I do wonder sometimes about why we go on having these terrible scares. Perhaps society as a whole is saying, 'Oh no, the Pill, that's naughty . . .' \"</p> <p>\"It's to do with sex,\" agrees Guillebaud. \"We're in the 21st century, but people still have hang-ups. They can't believe nature won't bite back in some way. Besides, only the bad news seems to make headlines.\"</p> <p>Will we ever be able to look at the Pill squarely, with true objectivity? The question might one day become quite unimportant. In a future of technology-driven reproduction, where human beings are no longer created in bedrooms and the backseats of cars, but in the carefully-controlled environment of the petri dish, current methods of birth control may come to seem quaintly old-fashioned. If that time comes, the Pill will come out of tens of millions of handbags and bathroom cabinets and find a new home: a coyly packaged curiosity in a museum of the 20th century.</p> <p>Perhaps it's appropriate that the man who had the first word on the Pill should be allowed the last. \"The Pill was the first step,\" says Carl Djerassi. \"It made sex without pregnancy possible. The next step will be to have pregnancy without sex. And when that happens, the Pill will be irrelevant.\"</p>",

Today, there is only one hundredth the amount of oestrogen that was in the original. Other modifications have added to its safety. During the 80s, a triphasic version of the drug was introduced, providing three different levels of hormone to be taken over the course of a month and corresponding more closely to a woman's natural cycle. Despite the safety of the new Pill, however, fears persist. In the mid-90s a link was suggested between the third-generation Pill and deep-vein thrombosis. Much was made of the fact that women taking this version had double the chances of death over users of the second-generation Pill. \"In 1995, a lot of women were frightened enough to stop taking the Pill altogether,\" says Sheila Hancock, a nurse at Marie Stopes who has been working in family planning since 1977. \"We saw more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions. We stopped using the third-generation pills for a while, and then the GMC okayed them again.\" A doubling of risk sounds terrifying enough, but what was the actual number of deaths being doubled? On the safer Pill, there were two deaths per million women per year. On the third-generation version, four deaths per million. \"Anybody who drives on the roads for a single hour per year increases their risk of death to one in a million,\" claims Professor Guillebaud. \"The difference in risk between the two brands of Pill is the same as going from two hours of driving per year to four.\" Recently, a suggested link between the Pill and breast cancer has been causing debate, and here the risks appear less clear-cut. At the moment, there's no hard evidence that the drug definitely increases a woman's chances of developing the disease. But it might. \"The bottom line,\" says Guillebaud, \"is that the Pill appears to be a weak co-factor in breast cancer. It's probably not the cause. If someone has early cancerous changes to the breast, the Pill can move it along.\" The good news is that, once you stop taking the Pill, your risk for breast cancer is unaffected by your former use of the drug. \"Ten years after taking the Pill, your risk goes back to what it would have been had you never taken it,\" says Guillebaud. He also points out that the time most women take the Pill - during their 20s and early 30s - are the years in which breast cancer is least likely to occur in a woman's life. \"Think of a room of 1,000 women,\" he says. \"All of them took the Pill for 20 years. Now aged 45, they are all ex-users who have not used the drug for 10 years. Eleven women in that room will have breast cancer. In a room of 1,000 women who have never taken the Pill, 10 will have breast cancer.\" Although there may be a small increased risk of breast cancer associated with the drug, it is offset by the Pill's protection against different forms of cancer. So, in the lottery of cancer as a whole, Pill-users may not be any better - or worse - off than anybody else. No one is denying that there are drawbacks to the Pill. Side-effects include an increased risk of blood clots, stroke and heart attack, and it can cause headaches, depression, nausea and skin problems. But all drugs have the potential for bad side-effects. Carl Djerassi tells the story of a talk he once gave, in which he described the risks associated with a certain unnamed medication. This drug, he said, sometimes caused gastro-intestinal distress, bleeding in the stomach and, very occasionally, a life-threatening allergic reaction. Given all this information, he asked his audience, would you still take the drug? They said they would have to think carefully before taking the medication. Their need for the drug would have to be high enough to merit such a risk. The name of the offending substance? Aspirin. \"People want the ideal contraceptive,\" states Djerassi. \"They want something 100% safe without any side-effects. Well, there's no such thing. It's simply not universally possible.\" So why, after four decades of its use, is the Pill still demonised? Why do the fears persist out of all proportion to actual risk? \"When I'm counselling women about whether they should take the Pill,\" says Sheila Hancock, \"my goal is to give them all the information to date and let them decide. But most of the women I see have far more knowledge about the negative aspects of the drug. Very few know about the cancer benefits. I do wonder sometimes about why we go on having these terrible scares. Perhaps society as a whole is saying, 'Oh no, the Pill, that's naughty . . .' \" \"It's to do with sex,\" agrees Guillebaud. \"We're in the 21st century, but people still have hang-ups. They can't believe nature won't bite back in some way. Besides, only the bad news seems to make headlines.\" Will we ever be able to look at the Pill squarely, with true objectivity? The question might one day become quite unimportant. In a future of technology-driven reproduction, where human beings are no longer created in bedrooms and the backseats of cars, but in the carefully-controlled environment of the petri dish, current methods of birth control may come to seem quaintly old-fashioned. If that time comes, the Pill will come out of tens of millions of handbags and bathroom cabinets and find a new home: a coyly packaged curiosity in a museum of the 20th century. Perhaps it's appropriate that the man who had the first word on the Pill should be allowed the last. \"The Pill was the first step,\" says Carl Djerassi. \"It made sex without pregnancy possible. The next step will be to have pregnancy without sex. And when that happens, the Pill will be irrelevant.\"",
