Not hard, Palmer's legions of critics will say. </p> <p>At the start of the season the 34-year-old Palmer was not even in the first team at Nottingham Forest after refusing to sit on the bench in a friendly. David Platt, he claims, wanted to force him out. </p> <p>\"He tried to insult my intelligence,\" Palmer says, \"and I wouldn't have that. If he'd said: 'Carlton, I need to sell you to get some money', fine. But to leave me out of a poor side? He said he made a mistake but once I lose respect for somebody, it doesn't matter if they apologise.\" </p> <p>Strachan, of course, is not complaining. Palmer is as energetic as ever, stealing passes, making tackles, surging forward. Before he arrived in September Coventry had lost six of their nine matches and conceded 18 goals. Since then their record reads played 17, lost two, goals against 13. Charlton visit in the FA Cup tomorrow. </p> <p>\"I was expecting to move back to Sheffield Wednesday and I wouldn't have said Gordon Strachan would have fancied me,\" Palmer admits. \"We were together at Leeds and we're similar characters - we desperately want to win. But we clashed often about the way I lived my life. The gaffer doesn't drink a lot and at that time... well I think I get paid to play football and as long as I do my job that's all that matters. That's how I was then.\" </p> <p>Yet Strachan says he would have signed Palmer sooner but for the midfielder's notoriously outspoken manner. He was worried whether he could cope with such a forceful figure; concerned about the signals it might send to the younger players when discipline was not at the standard he liked. </p> <p>\"I've said to him his opinions will be listened to but it's only my opinion that counts,\" Strachan says. \"He's still not really learned that but he's getting better at it. The key is to treat him the right way and not rubbish him. Sometimes his mouth's in the wrong place but his heart's always in the right place. </p> <p>\"I never had any doubts about him as a footballer. I admire the way he's reacted to criticism and kept going throughout his career. It's been unfair but he's never really complained about it. </p> <p>\"Any manager that worked with him will tell you he's good to work with. I think George Graham said to him I like you as a player but not for my team. You ask Big Ron [Atkinson] and Howard [Wilkinson]. Not a problem.\" </p> <p>Meeting Palmer explains why. His will to win is obvious even in training. He is constantly cajoling and encouraging. In person he is affable and honest, confident rather than arrogant. The barbs, he says, do not bother him, though he believes they cut short his international career. </p> <p>\"I know for a fact that Terry Venables didn't pick me for England because of the media,\" he says. \"I was player of the year at Leeds, playing exceptionally well, yet other people were getting capped ahead of me. I was very, very disappointed. I went to Southampton and Glenn Hoddle came to watch me but he wouldn't pick me because of the media. It's like Andy Cole. How the hell has Andy Cole not been playing for England? </p> <p>\"Rightly or wrongly, people believe what they read. Yet people see me play and they say 'Hang on, he's not a bad player'. And when they meet me they say, 'Hang on, he's not a bad person'. But in this world you're either a hero or a villain.\" </p> <p>Palmer has a long leg in both camps. There is the 'Do I not like Carlton' brigade who forever associate him with England's failure under Graham Taylor. Yet he is a cult figure to many fans whose clubs he has played for. </p> <p>One website describes him as having the \"engine of a Rolls Royce, the heart of a lion and the skill of Diego Maradona\". Whether the skill referred to the Argentine's heyday or his current state was unclear. </p> <p>\"People's opinions don't really bother me,\" he insists. \"I'm very single-minded. When I finish people will have to say I was a decent player. There are a lot of so-called good players who haven't achieved anywhere near what I've achieved.\"</p>",

He chucks the paper at us. \"I will not go on, just suffice it to say, I have withdrawn it from the match programme for the Liverpool game, lad.\" \"Behave, Deems,\" I says. \"It's important to make the right impression when Robbie and the boys are in town.\" \"It's in one ear and out the other with you, Dazz lad, isn't it?\" says Deems. \"Were you not at the media awareness seminar last month? Did you not attend the player profile module? And, Dazz lad, watch the company you keep.\" Wednesday One bit of old company I wouldn't mind shedding rings at his usual ungodly. \"Awight, boy?\" It's Rodney. \"Listen up. You done that questionnaire for the match programme like I asked? If not, give an associate of mine a little mench, boy. For your favourite night out, tell them it's that new Italian behind the station. Big Luigi would be very grateful. Could be a bread stick and a glass of Valpolicella in it for you, boy.\" Thursday At a bit of loose end tonight. Vic's at home tie-dying his hair, Bob's gone down with a bad case of turning off the mobile, and Wattsy's staying in with the missus to watch Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. \"Try it, Dazz,\" he says. \"We always have a good laugh, cos whatever the punters win, it's nowt compared to my take-home.\" \"Wattsy, we're out of the Cup, we've not got a game this weekend. Dell's calls.\" \"No, Dazz, I'm keeping a low profile.\" Sod him, Darren Tackle is not too proud to fly solo. As it happens, on me way Dellwards, waiting at a bus stop I sees Marco, the geezer what was always useful for a G or two before he went down for a three stretch in the summer. \"All right, Marcs?\" I says, winding down the window of the Jeep. \"Fallen on hard times, have we? Hop in, I'll give you a lift to Dell's.\" \"Sorry, Dazz,\" he says. \"Part of me deal for early release, probation officer tells me I've got to watch the company I keep. Fact is, I can't risk being seen with you, mate.\" Blimey. Still, beggars can't be choosers. Wonder if Rodney's at a loose end.",

      "body": "<p>England have probably crashed to more spineless defeats than this over the years, but it's hard to recall them at the moment. Today their batsmen were simply abysmal. Set a target of 212 to win the fourth Standard Bank Triangular Tournament game against Zimbabwe at Cape Town, they didn't even get close. They were bowled out for 107 in 34.2 overs as Henry Olonga claimed career-best figures of 6 for 19. It was gruesome, X-rated stuff. </p> <p>The England innings began amid optimism after their bowlers had fought back well to limit Zimbabwe to 211 for 7 on a decent wicket. But that optimism quickly evaporated in a flurry of poorly-conceived strokes and some incisive new-ball bowling from Olonga. He claimed the first five England wickets, beginning with a double-wicket maiden in the fifth over of the innings: after Nick Knight had been trapped lbw for 5 (11 for 1), Graeme Hick drove flat-footedly at his second ball and was caught behind for a duck. Hardly the way to make your former countrymen regret your change of nationality.</p> <p>Vikram Solanki sparkled briefly but became Olonga's third victim when he slashed a wide ball straight to Murray Goodwin in the gully for 14. It left England tottering at 37 for 3, but even that soon looked like riches from heaven when three wickets followed in quick succession. Olonga bowled Nasser Hussain for 10 off an inside edge (42 for 4), and then had Chris Adams steering in familiar fashion to second slip (47 for 5). Zimbabwe had obviously been watching the Test series against South Africa. Then Mark Alleyne nudged John Rennie to Andy Flower behind the stumps for four, and England were 47 for 6. Olonga took a rest at that point, leaving the field with figures of 8-3-18-5. Some England fans began leaving the stadium.</p> <p>Bored with offering catches behind the wicket, England contrived new ways of getting out. Mark Ealham went for a dubious third and was run out by a throw from square-leg by Heath Streak to make it 61 for 6. Craig White then chipped Neil Johnson to Alistair Campbell at short midwicket for 18, moments after Andy Flower dropped him off Guy Whittall. England were 73 for 8 - the darkest of many pits they have dug for themselves in recent times.</p> <p>It was 91 for 9 when Gough launched the off-spin of Andy Whittall to Stuart Carlisle at deep midwicket for three. Chris Read postponed the inevitable and drove Guy Whittall superbly through the covers for four to bring up the hundred, accompanied by ironic cheers from the Barmy Army. But with the score on 107, and with Olonga back in the attack, Read smashed him high to Guy Whittall to deep midwicket for 23 and it was all over. England had lost their sixth one-day international out of eight against this opposition.</p> <p>Earlier, England's bowlers had done well to limit Zimbabwe to 211 for 7 after the opening batsmen had got off to a flier. The fifty came up in the 10th over, and Zimbabwe were threatening a total of 270 plus when they reached 150 for 3 with almost 17 overs remaining. But Caddick returned to bowl a magnificent second spell (7-1-13-1) and the innings fell away. Johnson, with 97, did his best to hold things together, but departed to a fine catch on the square-leg boundary by Hick as a century beckoned. At the time it looked like England might have done enough. But, for the second time in three days on this ground, England failed under the lights. At least Wednesday was close.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

They were bowled out for 107 in 34.2 overs as Henry Olonga claimed career-best figures of 6 for 19. It was gruesome, X-rated stuff. The England innings began amid optimism after their bowlers had fought back well to limit Zimbabwe to 211 for 7 on a decent wicket. But that optimism quickly evaporated in a flurry of poorly-conceived strokes and some incisive new-ball bowling from Olonga. He claimed the first five England wickets, beginning with a double-wicket maiden in the fifth over of the innings: after Nick Knight had been trapped lbw for 5 (11 for 1), Graeme Hick drove flat-footedly at his second ball and was caught behind for a duck. Hardly the way to make your former countrymen regret your change of nationality. Vikram Solanki sparkled briefly but became Olonga's third victim when he slashed a wide ball straight to Murray Goodwin in the gully for 14. It left England tottering at 37 for 3, but even that soon looked like riches from heaven when three wickets followed in quick succession. Olonga bowled Nasser Hussain for 10 off an inside edge (42 for 4), and then had Chris Adams steering in familiar fashion to second slip (47 for 5). Zimbabwe had obviously been watching the Test series against South Africa. Then Mark Alleyne nudged John Rennie to Andy Flower behind the stumps for four, and England were 47 for 6. Olonga took a rest at that point, leaving the field with figures of 8-3-18-5. Some England fans began leaving the stadium. Bored with offering catches behind the wicket, England contrived new ways of getting out. Mark Ealham went for a dubious third and was run out by a throw from square-leg by Heath Streak to make it 61 for 6. Craig White then chipped Neil Johnson to Alistair Campbell at short midwicket for 18, moments after Andy Flower dropped him off Guy Whittall. England were 73 for 8 - the darkest of many pits they have dug for themselves in recent times. It was 91 for 9 when Gough launched the off-spin of Andy Whittall to Stuart Carlisle at deep midwicket for three. Chris Read postponed the inevitable and drove Guy Whittall superbly through the covers for four to bring up the hundred, accompanied by ironic cheers from the Barmy Army. But with the score on 107, and with Olonga back in the attack, Read smashed him high to Guy Whittall to deep midwicket for 23 and it was all over. England had lost their sixth one-day international out of eight against this opposition. Earlier, England's bowlers had done well to limit Zimbabwe to 211 for 7 after the opening batsmen had got off to a flier. The fifty came up in the 10th over, and Zimbabwe were threatening a total of 270 plus when they reached 150 for 3 with almost 17 overs remaining. But Caddick returned to bowl a magnificent second spell (7-1-13-1) and the innings fell away. Johnson, with 97, did his best to hold things together, but departed to a fine catch on the square-leg boundary by Hick as a century beckoned. At the time it looked like England might have done enough. But, for the second time in three days on this ground, England failed under the lights. At least Wednesday was close.

The two parties faced problems arising from their many conflicting policies and the issue of tuition fees proved to be the most volatile. Although both parties had promised to look into the issue of student funding, the Lib Dems made abolition of the fees the \"non-negotiable\" centrepiece of their election manifesto. Which raised a major conflict of interest between they and Labour, who abolished student grants and introduced a \u00a31000 means-tested fee in September 1998. </p> <p>Furthermore, in order to abolish up-front tuition fees for all Scots, EU law would demand that the Westminster government pay the fees of all 99,000 EU students studying in Britain. The Cubie committee - named after Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie who chaired the 14-strong body - formed in July 1999, in an attempt to find a solution to the problem which was threatening to undermine the fragile Scottish coalition. Charged with conducting a comprehensive review of tuition fees and the finances of Scottish students, the committee then made recommendations for any changes to the system. </p> <p><strong>What were Cubie's main recommendations?</strong> <br>Tuition fees were to be replaced by a Scottish graduate endowment scheme, whereby the Scottish executive paid the fees and students would be required to pay \u00a33,000 of it back when their earnings reached \u00a325,000 a year. </p> <p>Scottish students from low-income families would also be entitled to a bursary of up to \u00a32,050, akin to the old maintenance grant. Single parents and mature students would receive even more.</p> <p>Universities should develop part time employment schemes and advise students on how to establish a reasonable balance between supplementing their income and maintaining studies. A term-time maximum of 10 working hours a week was suggested.</p> <p>The threshold for parental and spousal contributions should be set so that families with earnings below \u00a323,000 would not have to make a contribution.</p> <p><strong>How much would Cubie's recommendations have cost?</strong> <br>\u00a371 million a year.</p> <p><strong>How much of the report has been excepted by the Scottish executive?</strong> <br> The executive has agreed to abolish up-front tuition fees and has announced a replacement graduate scheme similar to Cubie's proposals. Students will now pay back \u00a32,000, not \u00a33,000, but repayments will start once their earnings reach just \u00a310,000, which is significantly less than the average national wage and a long way off Cubie's \u00a325,000.</p> <p><strong>How has this been received?</strong> <br>Cubie himself was said to be \"broadly pleased\" with the reforms package, though he admitted he would have preferred his report to have been adopted in full. However, student leaders in Scotland strongly rejected the reforms, accusing the executive of \"back-pedalling\". Graeme McAulay, president of Edinburgh University Students Association, said: \"Changes such as the ones proposed are not merely a watering-down of the Cubie recommendations but new proposals which go against the whole spirit of the Cubie report.\"</p> <p><strong>How much will it cost and where will the money come from?</strong> <br> The executive has said the yearly cost will be \u00a350 million. \u00a317 million is expected to come from the graduate endowment scheme and the rest will be found by the Department of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.</p> <p><strong>What problems has this caused for David Blunkett?</strong> <br> The overwhelming resentment of English students, who still have to pay \u00a31,025 in upfront fees, has prompted the education and employment secretary to lower the means-tested threshold. This will now exempt a further 50,000 students from paying the fees.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When was the report commissioned and why? Scottish devolution created a ruling Labour-Lib Dem coalition. The two parties faced problems arising from their many conflicting policies and the issue of tuition fees proved to be the most volatile. Although both parties had promised to look into the issue of student funding, the Lib Dems made abolition of the fees the \"non-negotiable\" centrepiece of their election manifesto. Which raised a major conflict of interest between they and Labour, who abolished student grants and introduced a \u00a31000 means-tested fee in September 1998. Furthermore, in order to abolish up-front tuition fees for all Scots, EU law would demand that the Westminster government pay the fees of all 99,000 EU students studying in Britain. The Cubie committee - named after Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie who chaired the 14-strong body - formed in July 1999, in an attempt to find a solution to the problem which was threatening to undermine the fragile Scottish coalition. Charged with conducting a comprehensive review of tuition fees and the finances of Scottish students, the committee then made recommendations for any changes to the system. What were Cubie's main recommendations? Tuition fees were to be replaced by a Scottish graduate endowment scheme, whereby the Scottish executive paid the fees and students would be required to pay \u00a33,000 of it back when their earnings reached \u00a325,000 a year. Scottish students from low-income families would also be entitled to a bursary of up to \u00a32,050, akin to the old maintenance grant. Single parents and mature students would receive even more. Universities should develop part time employment schemes and advise students on how to establish a reasonable balance between supplementing their income and maintaining studies. A term-time maximum of 10 working hours a week was suggested. The threshold for parental and spousal contributions should be set so that families with earnings below \u00a323,000 would not have to make a contribution. How much would Cubie's recommendations have cost? \u00a371 million a year. How much of the report has been excepted by the Scottish executive? The executive has agreed to abolish up-front tuition fees and has announced a replacement graduate scheme similar to Cubie's proposals. Students will now pay back \u00a32,000, not \u00a33,000, but repayments will start once their earnings reach just \u00a310,000, which is significantly less than the average national wage and a long way off Cubie's \u00a325,000. How has this been received? Cubie himself was said to be \"broadly pleased\" with the reforms package, though he admitted he would have preferred his report to have been adopted in full. However, student leaders in Scotland strongly rejected the reforms, accusing the executive of \"back-pedalling\". Graeme McAulay, president of Edinburgh University Students Association, said: \"Changes such as the ones proposed are not merely a watering-down of the Cubie recommendations but new proposals which go against the whole spirit of the Cubie report.\" How much will it cost and where will the money come from? The executive has said the yearly cost will be \u00a350 million. \u00a317 million is expected to come from the graduate endowment scheme and the rest will be found by the Department of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. What problems has this caused for David Blunkett? The overwhelming resentment of English students, who still have to pay \u00a31,025 in upfront fees, has prompted the education and employment secretary to lower the means-tested threshold. This will now exempt a further 50,000 students from paying the fees.",

      "bodyText": "West Mercia police investigating the deaths of two black men, Harold and Jason McGowan, have met members of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force to receive advice on their handling of the investigation. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman last night confirmed that members of the racial task force had met on Wednesday with the senior detective appointed to scrutinise the investigation. \"Officers from the task force did meet with detectives from West Mercia on Wednesday in relation to an ongoing investigation as part of a wider process of consultation,\" she said. The squad is believed to have advised the detectives of the need to keep an open mind on possible causes of the deaths, as well as to check for possible links with extremist groups and to check with other forces for similar cases. They are also believed to have suggested that West Mercia should keep the family of the dead men up to date with all developments, and should hold joint press conferences appealing to the community for help. They should also seek to use programmes such as the BBC's Crimewatch in trying to establish any new lines of inquiry. Community leaders in Telford yesterday said that their Shropshire town had been unfairly portrayed as a racist hotbed, following media speculation over the suspicious deaths. The family of Harold McGowan, 32, who died in July, and his nephew, Jason McGowan, 20, found dead on New Year's Day, believe they were victims of racists who made their murders look like suicide. Harold McGowan, also known as Erroll, was found hanging by a flex from a door in a friend's house. Jason McGowan was discovered hanging from railings by the side of a road 100 yards from a pub where he was last seen with friends celebrating the new millennium. The family have reported that Harold McGowan had learned he was on a \"death list\" issued by a neo-Nazi group, Combat 18. They also allege that, after his death, members of the family were warned off trying to establish its cause. They have accused the police of prematurely ruling out foul play. Their complaints have been picked up by national newspapers and yesterday began to receive television coverage. West Mercia police said that, despite full investigations, no evidence had been found of third party involvement in the deaths. Wednesday's meeting enabled West Mercia officers to receive advice from the Met's racist and violent crime task force on improving relations with the family, including guidelines established in the wake of the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, and on being more open with the media. The West Mercia force has remained cautious regarding on the deaths and possible causes, insisting it can divulge little in advance of the inquest into Harold McGowan's death due on February 28. The family are urging a delay in the inquest date so that the two deaths can be considered together. The police have won local support. The Shropshire Star newspaper in Telford, where Jason McGowan once worked and which employs his wife, Sinead, and his mother, Doreen, yesterday ran a front-page comment criticising national coverage of the deaths. Under the headline Jason: is the grief distorting the facts?, the paper's editor, Adrian Faber, criticised the Independent for suggesting that the deaths could have been caused by a \"racist lynch mob\". \"Evidence to support a racist conspiracy theory is scant. We cannot allow rumour to become reality just because it is repeated often enough,\" Mr Faber wrote. He told of attending Jason McGowan's \"harrowing and heartbreaking\" funeral but said: \"This gigantic leap from a very personal tragedy that has touched us all, to talk of a murdering conspiracy is terrifying.\" Last night Sinead McGowan, employed in the Star's classified ads department, said she was \"a bit annoyed\" by the paper's article. \"I don't know why they haven't actually asked me to make a comment or anything. They haven't spoken to me since before the funeral.\" Dave Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said yesterday: \"The speculation has made people very unhappy, as the picture painted in the national media of Telford is unfair and not one that anyone locally recognises.\" Marie Barrow, chair of the Telford and Shropshire race equality council, said: \"We have a very good record in Telford and Shropshire. \"As in every other part of the country, racism does happen but the national headlines paint a very negative picture of the local community.\" West Mercia police said in a statement: \"We recognised immediately that the death of Harold McGowan was a serious incident and extensive resources were employed from the outset. \"When the second tragedy occurred the likelihood of sinister implication was immediately recognised. \"As a matter of normal practice in a major investigation a review has been carried out of our inquiry into the death of Harold McGowan.\"",

After viewing this week's menswear collections, it's fair to say there isn't exactly one big trend being pushed for autumn/winter. Whether you prefer to dapper up or dress down, experiment with colour or fall back on black, look to luxury or play it low-key, there was something to suit even the fussiest man. </p> <p>Paul Smith, the British designer who takes pride in offering personalised detailing within an eclectic cultural mix, summed up the mood with a collection that took Anglo tradition and melded it with techniques and influences gathered from Hungary, India and China. Whether it be a single button sewn on to a shirt with mismatched thread, a scarf that has taken one artisan 20 days to embroider by hand, or a shirt constructed entirely from army surplus handkerchiefs, Smith's imagination can only be admired. This was one of the designer's strongest collections for some time and while its presentation was a little long-winded and over-styled, individual items such as a tailored sheepskin jacket, washed harlequin-patterned sweater and plaid plus fours were truly covetable. </p> <p>Dries Van Noten dispensed with his usual catwalk presentation in favour of showing his collection on a one-to-one basis from his showroom. Two rooms lined with rails of clothes enabled his faithful followers to feel the fabrics and play at dressing up, putting together their own combinations from the never-ending wardrobe of Dries classics. Taking the Bloomsbury era as his inspiration, the Belgian designer came up with one of his best collections to date, including shrunken sweaters in cashmere, repaired with patches or Argyll, tweedy coats worn by time and chunky knit scarves which trailed the floor in blocks of colour. </p> <p>Designed by Alexander van Slobbe, So moved on from the uniformed minimalist styling of the past few seasons: in its place came felted wool jackets splattered with avant-garde prints by young Dutch artists. Second-hand sports T-shirts were taken apart and restructured under jackets that had a military feel and worn with textured trousers that had a slight kick at the ankle. </p> <p>Recycling was also the focus for Rei Kawakubo's collection at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Jackets and sweaters in shrunken sizes were dismantled and used as two-dimensional appliqu\u00e9d panels over garments that fitted the body snugly. Pleated tartan trousers were cut away at the back and replaced with the backs of marl jersey jogging bottoms. Kawakubo's playful experiments with colour and mismatched plaids are beginning to look a little tired; her boxy suiting silhouettes are not in tune with the sympathetic lines of the luxury tailoring so prevalent this season. </p> <p>The Anglo-Saxon teen angst that once gave Raf Simons his unique appeal (think Joy Division mixed with sixth-former school uniform) is the very same inspiration that will eventually be the Belgian designer's downfall. Simons' signature style, with its evocations of early 80s British suburbia, seems to have run its course. He should move on, but instead he stuck to a tried and tested formula, with slim-cut suits in black and ash grey felt, school shirts and sweaters in Oxford blue. More inspiring were corduroy Harrington jackets, kimono-sleeved blousons and a vicar's coat in heavy black cashmere. </p> <p>Roy Krejberg's first go-it-alone collection for Kenzo looks set to be a commercial success. Using predominantly natural fabrics, it was not a great departure from the signature style established by Kenzo himself (who retired in October last year) but seemed younger and more in tune with current tastes. A lot is planned for the Kenzo label for the near future, including new stores and a sportswear line headed by British designer Jeff Griffin. </p> <p>Herm\u00e8s offered its usual brand of luxury dressing, but this time it was more pared down and youthful. Other than the pedigree tailoring we have come to expect from the label, shearling jackets (the fur dyed the signature Herm\u00e8s orange) and velvet suits in violet, apple green or citrus tones should appeal to a new customer. </p> <p> Yohji Yamamoto also looked more modern. Suits pieced together from angular patchworks of fabric in primary colours offered a much-needed injection of quirkiness into what was otherwise Yamamoto's most commercial collection for some time. </p> <p>Three designers from the contingent of young labels showing in Paris really shone. German-based Kostas Murkudis showed an edgy take on androgynous dressing, inspired by Native Americans. Dirk Schonberger, Belgium's latest export, showed military clothing mixed with subtle tailoring checks. And Xavier Delcour, designing under the label Only For Men, staged the second best show of the week, fusing raw-edged deconstruction with polished sophistication. He looks like one of the most exciting young bloods to come out of Europe in quite some time. </p> <p>The two most eagerly anticipated shows in town proved to be poles apart, style-wise. Marc Jacobs, in his debut menswear catwalk show for Louis Vuitton, and Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche were the two primary reasons for coming to Paris. Vuitton, with its overstyling of staid classic bourgeois menswear, was disappointing. Jacobs' collection was described as \"for the jetset man who is international\" - my advice to this jetset man would be to stay at home. Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, however, was a rare fashion moment. Never has menswear looked so luxurious without being untouchable, sexy without being crass, innovative without paying bland respect to a heritage. Black leather frock coats, belted chemises, patent astro-turf coats and luxurious woollens made this Slimane's finest collection to date. Entitled Black Tie (everything was black except for a finale of gold jeans and mauve silk jersey tops), it was a masterclass in cutting. Menswear does not get much better than this and while speculation may surround Slimane's future now that Gucci has taken control of the label, let's hope that Tom Ford has the sense not to fix what isn't broken. </p> <p>Adrian Clark is fashion director of Attitude.</p>",

      "body": "<p>We have done much to promote British values of democracy and freedom.</p> <p>We have given a new priority to human rights. We now run projects to give practical support to human rights from developing village democracy in China to fighting sexual exploitation in the Philippines. We have launched a global programme to challenge torture and to help its victims. We have dropped the previous government's refusal to lobby against the use of the death penalty. We now consistently oppose its use. We have turned the UK into a leading advocate for the international criminal court. We have been robust in detaining war criminals in Bosnia, and we give wider support to the war crimes tribunals than any other single nation. We have introduced tough new criteria on arms sales and secured a European Code of Conduct which extends similar standards to our partners, and competitors, in the European Union. We have also introduced a detailed annual report which makes the UK more transparent on arms exports than any other European nation.</p> <p>But the clearest contrast is between the long years of temporising with Milosevic which marked the response to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and our defeat of his attempt to do the same in Kosovo. The Kosovar Albanians may have witnessed many appalling scenes. But at least they were spared the sight of the international community tolerating the oppression which produced the massacre of Srebrenica. And they have been spared the long-term consequences of such temporising: six months after the Kosovo conflict, most Kosovar refugees have returned home; four years after Dayton, the majority of Bosnian refugees still have not.</p> <p>I am content to leave the last word on our record to Amnesty whose recent report concluded that this government 'has made a genuine and active commitment to human rights'. Not many governments can quote with satisfaction the verdict of Amnesty International.</p> <p><b>Promoting human rights</b></p> <p>Curiously, it is our pursuit of diplomacy for democracy that has proved the most controversial part of our foreign policy. The proposition that there should be a place for promoting human rights within foreign policy is one that would produce consensus not controversy in North America or most other European countries. There is no need for this to be a matter of partisan politics in Britain either. Let me therefore deal with the two most common lines of attack.</p> <p>My reply to them is not a fresh invention. I anticipated both of them when I set out our commitment on human rights within a month of taking office.</p> <p>The first line of attack is that our democratic values and our national interests are doomed to conflict in foreign policy that we must choose between promoting our values or pursuing our interests. Whether that was ever true in the past I leave to historians to debate. But those who advance that view are still living in the past. In the global age it is in Britain's national interest to promote British values of freedom and democracy.</p> <p>Along with authoritarian government come corruption and arbitrary government. What trade and investment require is competition, transparency and the rule of law. All are more easily built on an open society and accountable government.</p> <p>governments which respect freedom of expression are more likely to provide the transparency to be secure trading partners. Countries which observe the rule of law at home are more likely to accept their international obligations to fight the drugs trade or halt weapons proliferation.</p> <p>Promoting our values enhances our prosperity, and reinforces our security.</p> <p>The second line of attack is even more specious. It claims that, because we cannot put everything right, it is inconsistent to try to put anything right. This is not a maxim which we follow in any other walk of life, else we would be reduced to permanent paralysis. Nor should we let it bring foreign policy to a halt.</p> <p>I flatly reject the cynical view that, because we cannot make the world perfect, we should give up on trying to make it better. The obligation on us is not to put everything right, but to do what we can to make a difference. We will therefore take every realistic, responsible step to pursue diplomacy for democracy.</p> <p>The advances we secure may seem modest when set against the global scale of human oppression. But they do not seem negligible to those who gain in freedom as a result. I have heard it argued that, because it is not sensible to intervene in Chechnya, we should not have intervened in Kosovo. I would like to be present if those who argue that counsel of defeatism ever have the courage to advance it to an audience of Kosovar Albanians who know that the net result would have been to leave up to a million of them throughout this winter homeless in Macedonia and Albania. Or to audiences in East Timor who know they would not now be independent without the help of an international coalition of which Britain was a prominent member.</p> <p>Shopping before Christmas I was approached by a man who said reflectively above the Christmas jingles, \"You're doing as good a job as we can hope for in the real world\". I am content to accept that judgement as much more balanced and mature than those commentators who demand perfection or nothing.</p> <p><b>Interventional</b></p> <p>The biggest unresolved question in upholding universal values is when is it right for the international community to intervene and who decides that it is right? The United Nations Charter declares that 'armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest'. But what is the common interest, and who shall define it? We need to establish new rules of the road.</p> <p>The UK has submitted to the UN secretary-general in response to those questions a set of ideas to help the international community decide when it is right to act.</p> <p>first, any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort; second, the immediate responsibility for halting violence rests with the state in which it occurs; but, third, when faced with an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe and a government that has demonstrated itself unwilling or unable to halt or prevent it, the international community should act; and finally, any use of force in this context should be collective, proportionate, likely to achieve its objective, and carried out in accordance with international law.</p> <p>Britain will be seeking the broadest possible agreement on these principles to take forward the debate on intervention at the UN Millennium Summit in the autumn.</p> <p><b>Stronger in Europe, stronger in the world</b></p> <p>critical engagement, enlightened self-interest and diplomacy for democracy provide a foreign policy through which we can best pursue Britain's national interests.</p> <p>Those national interests girdle the globe. The diplomatic strategy I have outlined is pursued in every continent. But the stronger Britain's standing in our own continent of Europe, the greater the leverage we will have in the other six.</p> <p>This is such a self-evident proposition that it is surprising it needs to be stated. Yet there are a number of people who seem to believe that the UK can project a foreign policy that goes all the way round the world without passing through Europe.</p> <p>Any sane foreign policy must start by accepting the facts of geography. Europe is where we belong. We cannot opt by political levitation to belong to another continent. As someone once famously said, there is no alternative. As one of her Foreign Secretaries, Lord Carrington, wrote in his memoirs, \"Britain's destiny is Europe\".</p> <p>The most strategic shift that the present government has brought to foreign policy has been to take Britain off the sidelines of Europe and into the front row of the team. The result has been to transform Britain's standing not just in Europe, but around the world.</p> <p>It used to be argued that a stronger relationship with Europe would weaken our relationship with America. The converse is the truth. This government has built a remarkable partnership with Washington because the Administration know they are now dealing with a British government that can deliver in Europe. We could not have played the role that we did during the Kosovo crisis in promoting the cohesion and resolve of the Alliance on both sides of the Atlantic if we had not first secured respect in Europe.</p> <p>Nor is it only in Washington that our standing rises with our influence in Europe. In the Middle East last week I was struck by the extent to which Britain is valued because we can now be a leading advocate of the Middle East peace process within the European Union. From Japan we hear repeated messages that they value their economic ties with Britain precisely because it is a gateway to the wider European market.</p> <p>That market is about to become even wider as a result of European Re-union with the countries of central and eastern Europe. A European Union stretching from Portugal to Poland, and from Estonia to Cyprus, will soon be a reality. Simply to contemplate such an immense partnership of European nations is to recognise the necessity of Britain being part of it.</p> <p>And not a semi-detached member of it. There is no point being half-in, half-out. A half-hearted Britain would deliver only half our interests in Europe. The best way to secure Britain's national interests in Europe, and to promote those interests around the rest of the world, is for us to be recognised as a leading player in Europe.</p> <p>The European Union is one of the most successful models yet devised for coping with an age in which nations are more interdependent than they are independent. It has reinforced mutual respect for the borders between nations. But at the same time, it has dismantled borders as barriers between people and between businesses. Only those who have a psychological need for the comfort blanket of protection from the outside world should fear the result as a threat.</p> <p>To the great mass of the British people the Union has offered new opportunities:</p> <p>the Single Market gives them a better prospect of a job and prosperity. UK exports to the rest of the European Union as a share of GDP have nearly doubled since we joined; the right to move and work freely is the reason why at any one time a hundred thousand of our citizens earn their living in the continental EU; common standards guarantee our consumers the quality and safety of goods in their shops. Our businesses gain from manufacturing for a single European standard rather than fifteen different national ones; enhanced cooperation between police forces and customs has strengthened the fight against cross border crime. In the past two years joint operations have led to big seizures of drugs on their way to Britain; tougher pollution controls have preserved our environment and improved the quality of life of our people. From greenhouse gases to acid rain, the European Union is an essential forum for ensuring that pollution in one country does not undermine the efforts of its neighbours.</p> <p>To complain that all these benefits infringe our right to unilateral action is pointless. These gains for our people could not have been secured by unilateral action by us alone.</p> <p>None of them would have been possible without agreements binding on our partners as well as ourselves. Objectively it is the eurosceptics who are undermining the national interest by opposing constructive engagement with Europe. Constructive engagement is the best strategy to deliver benefits for the British people.</p> <p>We apply the same approach in formulating our policy on the single currency. We believe that Britain would benefit from joining a successful Euro, provided our five tests were met. It would be justified if it made our economy stronger and more prosperous. It is a policy firmly rooted in the national interest. It is the eurosceptics who ignore that national interest by foreclosing for ever the option of joining the euro, even if it served Britain's real economic needs.</p> <p>Ironically, it is those who most stridently oppose the process of European integration who most loudly proclaim their support for NATO. The UK has indeed gained half a century of unprecedented security from NATO, an Alliance forged under a Labour government. But, to achieve that gain in security, NATO requires a pooling of sovereignty in the area most sensitive for traditional concepts of national identity. Allies have to commit themselves to collective defence, accept each other's troops on their territory, and place their armies under joint command. Surely, if it is desirable to pool sovereignty to obtain military security, it must also be sensible to pool sovereignty to create jobs, to protect our environment or to defeat cross-border crime.</p> <p>None of this means the end of the nation state. On the contrary, the age of globalisation has been paralleled by strong assertions of national identity and culture. A healthy democracy needs the social cohesion provided by national identity if its minority are to accept those elected by the majority as their legitimate representatives. That is why Gerhard Schroeder rightly told his party congress last month that the nation state will be the centre of people's hopes and needs. And why Jacques Chirac has said Europe's future is not a United States of Europe but a United Europe of States.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Last year, I heard Kofi Annan making a moving speech in which he told the UN general assembly that:</p> <p>'As the world has changed in profound ways since the end of the cold war, I believe our conceptions of national interest have failed to follow suit. (We need) a new, more broadly defined definition of national interest.... A global era requires global engagement. Indeed, in a growing number of challenges facing humanity, the collective interest is the national interest.'</p> <p>I believe Kofi is right. The new forces of globalisation offer immense prospects for progress. Those prospects will be fulfilled only if we take every opportunity to pursue our national interest through a foreign policy that also meets the international interest.</p>",

But at least they were spared the sight of the international community tolerating the oppression which produced the massacre of Srebrenica. And they have been spared the long-term consequences of such temporising: six months after the Kosovo conflict, most Kosovar refugees have returned home; four years after Dayton, the majority of Bosnian refugees still have not. I am content to leave the last word on our record to Amnesty whose recent report concluded that this government 'has made a genuine and active commitment to human rights'. Not many governments can quote with satisfaction the verdict of Amnesty International. Promoting human rights Curiously, it is our pursuit of diplomacy for democracy that has proved the most controversial part of our foreign policy. The proposition that there should be a place for promoting human rights within foreign policy is one that would produce consensus not controversy in North America or most other European countries. There is no need for this to be a matter of partisan politics in Britain either. Let me therefore deal with the two most common lines of attack. My reply to them is not a fresh invention. I anticipated both of them when I set out our commitment on human rights within a month of taking office. The first line of attack is that our democratic values and our national interests are doomed to conflict in foreign policy that we must choose between promoting our values or pursuing our interests. Whether that was ever true in the past I leave to historians to debate. But those who advance that view are still living in the past. In the global age it is in Britain's national interest to promote British values of freedom and democracy. Along with authoritarian government come corruption and arbitrary government. What trade and investment require is competition, transparency and the rule of law. All are more easily built on an open society and accountable government. governments which respect freedom of expression are more likely to provide the transparency to be secure trading partners. Countries which observe the rule of law at home are more likely to accept their international obligations to fight the drugs trade or halt weapons proliferation. Promoting our values enhances our prosperity, and reinforces our security. The second line of attack is even more specious. It claims that, because we cannot put everything right, it is inconsistent to try to put anything right. This is not a maxim which we follow in any other walk of life, else we would be reduced to permanent paralysis. Nor should we let it bring foreign policy to a halt. I flatly reject the cynical view that, because we cannot make the world perfect, we should give up on trying to make it better. The obligation on us is not to put everything right, but to do what we can to make a difference. We will therefore take every realistic, responsible step to pursue diplomacy for democracy. The advances we secure may seem modest when set against the global scale of human oppression. But they do not seem negligible to those who gain in freedom as a result. I have heard it argued that, because it is not sensible to intervene in Chechnya, we should not have intervened in Kosovo. I would like to be present if those who argue that counsel of defeatism ever have the courage to advance it to an audience of Kosovar Albanians who know that the net result would have been to leave up to a million of them throughout this winter homeless in Macedonia and Albania. Or to audiences in East Timor who know they would not now be independent without the help of an international coalition of which Britain was a prominent member. Shopping before Christmas I was approached by a man who said reflectively above the Christmas jingles, \"You're doing as good a job as we can hope for in the real world\". I am content to accept that judgement as much more balanced and mature than those commentators who demand perfection or nothing. Interventional The biggest unresolved question in upholding universal values is when is it right for the international community to intervene and who decides that it is right? The United Nations Charter declares that 'armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest'. But what is the common interest, and who shall define it? We need to establish new rules of the road. The UK has submitted to the UN secretary-general in response to those questions a set of ideas to help the international community decide when it is right to act. first, any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort; second, the immediate responsibility for halting violence rests with the state in which it occurs; but, third, when faced with an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe and a government that has demonstrated itself unwilling or unable to halt or prevent it, the international community should act; and finally, any use of force in this context should be collective, proportionate, likely to achieve its objective, and carried out in accordance with international law. Britain will be seeking the broadest possible agreement on these principles to take forward the debate on intervention at the UN Millennium Summit in the autumn. Stronger in Europe, stronger in the world critical engagement, enlightened self-interest and diplomacy for democracy provide a foreign policy through which we can best pursue Britain's national interests. Those national interests girdle the globe. The diplomatic strategy I have outlined is pursued in every continent. But the stronger Britain's standing in our own continent of Europe, the greater the leverage we will have in the other six. This is such a self-evident proposition that it is surprising it needs to be stated. Yet there are a number of people who seem to believe that the UK can project a foreign policy that goes all the way round the world without passing through Europe. Any sane foreign policy must start by accepting the facts of geography. Europe is where we belong. We cannot opt by political levitation to belong to another continent. As someone once famously said, there is no alternative. As one of her Foreign Secretaries, Lord Carrington, wrote in his memoirs, \"Britain's destiny is Europe\". The most strategic shift that the present government has brought to foreign policy has been to take Britain off the sidelines of Europe and into the front row of the team. The result has been to transform Britain's standing not just in Europe, but around the world. It used to be argued that a stronger relationship with Europe would weaken our relationship with America. The converse is the truth. This government has built a remarkable partnership with Washington because the Administration know they are now dealing with a British government that can deliver in Europe. We could not have played the role that we did during the Kosovo crisis in promoting the cohesion and resolve of the Alliance on both sides of the Atlantic if we had not first secured respect in Europe. Nor is it only in Washington that our standing rises with our influence in Europe. In the Middle East last week I was struck by the extent to which Britain is valued because we can now be a leading advocate of the Middle East peace process within the European Union. From Japan we hear repeated messages that they value their economic ties with Britain precisely because it is a gateway to the wider European market. That market is about to become even wider as a result of European Re-union with the countries of central and eastern Europe. A European Union stretching from Portugal to Poland, and from Estonia to Cyprus, will soon be a reality. Simply to contemplate such an immense partnership of European nations is to recognise the necessity of Britain being part of it. And not a semi-detached member of it. There is no point being half-in, half-out. A half-hearted Britain would deliver only half our interests in Europe. The best way to secure Britain's national interests in Europe, and to promote those interests around the rest of the world, is for us to be recognised as a leading player in Europe. The European Union is one of the most successful models yet devised for coping with an age in which nations are more interdependent than they are independent. It has reinforced mutual respect for the borders between nations. But at the same time, it has dismantled borders as barriers between people and between businesses. Only those who have a psychological need for the comfort blanket of protection from the outside world should fear the result as a threat. To the great mass of the British people the Union has offered new opportunities: the Single Market gives them a better prospect of a job and prosperity. UK exports to the rest of the European Union as a share of GDP have nearly doubled since we joined; the right to move and work freely is the reason why at any one time a hundred thousand of our citizens earn their living in the continental EU; common standards guarantee our consumers the quality and safety of goods in their shops. Our businesses gain from manufacturing for a single European standard rather than fifteen different national ones; enhanced cooperation between police forces and customs has strengthened the fight against cross border crime. In the past two years joint operations have led to big seizures of drugs on their way to Britain; tougher pollution controls have preserved our environment and improved the quality of life of our people. From greenhouse gases to acid rain, the European Union is an essential forum for ensuring that pollution in one country does not undermine the efforts of its neighbours. To complain that all these benefits infringe our right to unilateral action is pointless. These gains for our people could not have been secured by unilateral action by us alone. None of them would have been possible without agreements binding on our partners as well as ourselves. Objectively it is the eurosceptics who are undermining the national interest by opposing constructive engagement with Europe. Constructive engagement is the best strategy to deliver benefits for the British people. We apply the same approach in formulating our policy on the single currency. We believe that Britain would benefit from joining a successful Euro, provided our five tests were met. It would be justified if it made our economy stronger and more prosperous. It is a policy firmly rooted in the national interest. It is the eurosceptics who ignore that national interest by foreclosing for ever the option of joining the euro, even if it served Britain's real economic needs. Ironically, it is those who most stridently oppose the process of European integration who most loudly proclaim their support for NATO. The UK has indeed gained half a century of unprecedented security from NATO, an Alliance forged under a Labour government. But, to achieve that gain in security, NATO requires a pooling of sovereignty in the area most sensitive for traditional concepts of national identity. Allies have to commit themselves to collective defence, accept each other's troops on their territory, and place their armies under joint command. Surely, if it is desirable to pool sovereignty to obtain military security, it must also be sensible to pool sovereignty to create jobs, to protect our environment or to defeat cross-border crime. None of this means the end of the nation state. On the contrary, the age of globalisation has been paralleled by strong assertions of national identity and culture. A healthy democracy needs the social cohesion provided by national identity if its minority are to accept those elected by the majority as their legitimate representatives. That is why Gerhard Schroeder rightly told his party congress last month that the nation state will be the centre of people's hopes and needs. And why Jacques Chirac has said Europe's future is not a United States of Europe but a United Europe of States. Conclusion Last year, I heard Kofi Annan making a moving speech in which he told the UN general assembly that: 'As the world has changed in profound ways since the end of the cold war, I believe our conceptions of national interest have failed to follow suit. (We need) a new, more broadly defined definition of national interest.... A global era requires global engagement. Indeed, in a growing number of challenges facing humanity, the collective interest is the national interest.' I believe Kofi is right. The new forces of globalisation offer immense prospects for progress. Those prospects will be fulfilled only if we take every opportunity to pursue our national interest through a foreign policy that also meets the international interest.",

No national economy is now an island. </p> <p>The growth curve in communications is ultra-exponential. In the US, the world wide web has attracted 50 million users in four years: to do the same took television 13 years and radio 38. Access to information on the internet expands by a million pages every day. </p> <p>The extraordinary capacity of the new technology to communicate instantly, and cheaply, around the globe has produced the \"death of distance\" as the defining barrier between states and continents. It also makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to co-exist with modern economies. Even the most vigilant border guard is unable to challenge the mighty click of a mouse.</p> <p>It is a curiosity of semantics that the word 'internationalism' produces a favourable reaction, except on the wilder shores of reactionary isolationism. But the word \"globalisation\" generally provokes a wary, if not hostile, reaction. If you asked me whether I am in favour of globalisation, I would give broadly the same answer as Tom Friedman. </p> <p>My attitude to globalisation is much the same as my attitude to the dawn. On balance, I think it is a good thing that the sun rises every day. But I also know there is nothing I can do to stop it even if I wanted to. Similarly, the only rational response to globalisation is to pursue strategies that maximise benefits and minimise damage.</p> <p> <b>Goals and principles</b></p> <p>What then is the foreign policy that helps deliver the benefits of globalisation and deflect its damage to Britain?</p> <p>The purpose of our foreign policy is to pursue our national interests. In broad terms, those national interests are the four objectives I set out in the mission statement for the foreign office in this parliament:</p> <p><br>\u0095 promoting prosperity through trade and the British economy; <br>\u0095 ensuring the security of the United Kingdom; <br>\u0095 enhancing the quality of life of people through global diplomacy on environment, the drugs trade and cross-border crime; and <br>\u0095 building respect for our values by supporting human rights and freedom</p> <p>How the foreign office promotes those national interests requires us to understand the modern world, and produce a strategy that relates to the world as it will be in this new century, not as it was in the last.</p> <p>I propose four guiding principles that can help us shape a foreign policy for the internationalist century:</p> <p><br>\u0095 globalisation requires more bridges and fewer barriers; <br>\u0095 the global interest is becoming the national interest; <br>\u0095 the global community needs universal values; and <br>\u0095 the stronger Britain's standing in our own continent, the greater the leverage we will have in the other six.</p> <p><b>Bridges not barriers</b></p> <p>For diplomacy the starting point must be that globalisation requires bridges and removes barriers. A policy of containment is a difficult strategy in the age of the fibre-optic cable, the jumbo jet and the satellite dish. There will always be the exception, such as the murderous regime in Iraq where the only safe strategy is to keep it in the isolation ward until it accepts the norms of international behaviour. Or the military dictatorship in Burma which has persistently failed to respond to dialogue. It takes two to critically engage. </p> <p><b>Critical engagement</b></p> <p>But as a general rule it is increasingly hard to bar the multiple doors that globalisation forces open. We have therefore adopted a conscious policy of critical engagement - the pursuit of political dialogue wherever it can produce benefits. </p> <p>This strategy of critical engagement has produced practical gains for British interests. For instance, with Argentina, we hosted a visit of reconciliation by former President Menem. We followed it up with an agreement that puts communications between Argentina and the Falklands on a secure basis. </p> <p>We are robustly committed to the long-standing policy that the Falkland Islands will be British so long as their residents wish it. But, the more we build confidence between ourselves and Argentina, the greater the security we can offer the islanders.</p> <p>Critical engagement in other cases may require involvement without illusions about the regimes with which we negotiate.</p> <p>With Libya, we have secured the handover of the two Lockerbie suspects and compensation for the killing of WPC Fletcher. We have returned a British ambassador to Tripoli after fifteen years, enhancing our capacity to promote British interests there and to register our concerns.</p> <p>With Iran, we have obtained a commitment from the government that they will not carry out the fatwa nor help others to do so. Once again, we have an ambassador in Tehran. That does not mean we have stopped having concerns about a number of policies of Iran, nor that we have stopped expressing them frankly. But it must be right to respond to the growing popular demands within Iran for modernisation and moderation.</p> <p>With Cuba, I have had the first formal meeting with a Cuban foreign minister since the Castro revolution forty years ago. We retain deep concerns about human rights in Cuba. But we are more likely to make progress if Cuba is more open to the world, and the world more open to Cuba.</p> <p>Such dialogues can be uncomfortable to those who believe we best preserve the purity of our commitment to human rights by refusing to talk to the very regimes that need to hear our message. Such a policy may leave us with clean hands. But is unlikely to provide their people with better rights. </p> <p><b>Dialogue of civilisations</b></p> <p>One strength that Britain brings to the task of bridge-building is that modern Britain is a multi-faith, multi-cultural society. Here in London some 200 different languages are spoken. We must use this rich cultural advantage and experience of tolerance to promote tolerance abroad. </p> <p>Globalisation foreshortens the landscape of diplomacy. Europe and the Middle East are now near neighbours. Last week in Cairo I called upon the Grand Shaikh of Al-Azhar. He quoted to me the verse in the Koran which provides an injunction to tolerance:</p> <p>\"We created you from a single pair of male and female and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other, not that you may despise each other.\"</p> <p>It is a fallacy to imagine our two civilisations as separate rather than entwined. In the computer age, we should not forget that we still count in Arabic numerals.</p> <p>Globalisation throws us into intimate and frequent contact with other civilisations. The ultimate test of diplomacy will be whether we can turn contact with other faiths, cultures, and cuisines, to enriching the lives of our people and whether we can diminish its potential to provoke friction, violence or conflict.</p> <p><b>Russia</b></p> <p>The biggest question for critical engagement is how we can accommodate post-Soviet Russia into European structures. From Peter the Great and the boyars to Stalin and Trotsky, a dominant theme of Russian politics has been the tension between those who wanted to build a fortress Russia and those who recognised that Russia must engage with the world beyond its borders.</p> <p>Shorn of its colourful episodes, Yeltsin's Presidency will be respected for burying the cold war and establishing Russia as a fully committed player in international forums such as the G8. Yet there remains in Russia a large audience for the old-fashioned songs of nationalism and isolationism. In part this is because the west has not been as skilful as it might have been in helping replace communism with a market economy and the rule of law.</p> <p>We have real disagreements with Russia and it is right to discuss them frankly. Their conduct in Chechnya is unacceptable and has produced grave humanitarian suffering. Nor, without a political settlement, will it produce their own stated objective of defeating the terrorists. We must bring that message home to Moscow, as we did on Monday when the EU suspended work on its next programme of financial and technical aid.</p> <p>But the wider question is how we find the diplomatic strategies that develop Russia as a comfortable, willing partner in the global economy and in global security. Russia has ceased to be an opponent of the West. But that is not enough. We need to work closely with the new Russian leadership, and get across our message to the Russian people that the advantages to Russia of being open to the west, attracting western investment and working together to resolve regional conflicts, vastly outweigh any claimed benefits of a chauvinist isolation.</p> <p> <b>Global interest and national interest</b></p> <p> The second guiding principle which I set out was that our national interest will more and more coincide with the global interest.</p> <p> This is the one which might appear most strange to the world which Chatham inhabited. In his day foreign policy was a zero sum game, with advantage to one player automatically resulting in disadvantage to another. The balance of power which he pursued expressed the objective of foreign policy as an equilibrium of opposing forces in which the greatest threat to the national interest came from other nations.</p> <p> Today the more immediate challenges to our national interests are likely to be transnational forces - turmoil in financial markets, spread of the drugs trade, or proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. There is no greater national duty than the defence of our shoreline. But the most immediate threat to it today is the encroaching sea, rising as a result of climate change which we can manage only by global action.</p> <p> Some politicians still take a view of the world as a jungle in which the only guiding star is unilateral self-interest. In reality, diplomacy today meets the national interest by forging tactical alliances and building coalitions to secure joint objectives. That is why this government believes that Britain is best served by a foreign policy of enlightened self-interest.</p> <p> The labels of unilateralist and multilateralist have become inverted. It is the parties of the Right, still clinging hopelessly and touchingly to an outdated model of the nation state in isolation, who are the modern unilateralists. It is the parties of the Left of Centre, with their preference for collective solutions, who are better fitted to understand and operate in the modern multilateralist world. </p> <p> Britain has more to gain than any other single state from an orderly international framework for the global economy. We depend for our living on trade. We export more per head than either the US or Japan. In absolute terms, our trade with the wider world is twice as great as at the zenith of Empire. We have a larger portfolio of overseas investment than any other European nation. We have more to lose from instability in the international markets. </p> <p> It is fortunate therefore that Britain also has a broader representation than any other state on the multilateral bodies that will help shape the global economy. We are the only state which is a member of the G8, the EU, NATO, and the Commonwealth, and is a permanent member of the security council. Britain has a unique opportunity to pursue the national interest through the global interest. </p> <p> If Russia is the biggest challenge for critical engagement, reform of the security council is the biggest unresolved question for multilateral diplomacy. The size of the security council and its permanent membership still replicates the world as it was in 1945. The world has moved on. The UN itself has more than trebled in numbers. The security council risks losing credibility unless it more fairly represents the world as it is today. A modest increase in the numbers on the Security Council seems a small price to pay for a big gain in the Council's authority. That would enhance, not dilute, Britain's position as a permanent member.</p> <p> <b>Universal values</b></p> <p> But even the strongest global institution will sound an uncertain note if it is not clear as to the values which it is meant to promote - which brings me to my third guiding principle, the need for universal values in an age of universal trade and global communications.</p> <p> The Cold War fostered client states whose repressive behaviour was often condoned in return for their loyalty to one or other camp. This was a particular paradox for the West. All too often it found itself in the pursuit of a proclaimed crusade for freedom shoring up regimes for whom freedom was not on the agenda.</p> <p> By contrast, the age of globalisation is creating more progressive pressures. Regimes which govern their citizens by fear and repression cannot expect the same people to display the creativity and innovation in the workplace which are essential for a knowledge-based economy. Respect for human rights is not a luxury of growth, but the condition of that growth.</p> <p> So it is not surprising that democracy has made major gains in the past decade. In Europe the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have chosen democracy. There are no military juntas left in Latin America. In 1975 only three heads of state in Africa were chosen by elections. In 1999, there were 32. The military coup in Pakistan has been so universally condemned precisely because it is out of joint with the times.</p> <p> We support human rights and democracy for other people because these are values we demand for ourselves. That is why the third theme of our foreign policy for the modern age is diplomacy for democracy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/ethical/article/0,2763,129962,00.html\">Click here</a> for the rest of the speech.</p>",

Yet there remains in Russia a large audience for the old-fashioned songs of nationalism and isolationism. In part this is because the west has not been as skilful as it might have been in helping replace communism with a market economy and the rule of law. We have real disagreements with Russia and it is right to discuss them frankly. Their conduct in Chechnya is unacceptable and has produced grave humanitarian suffering. Nor, without a political settlement, will it produce their own stated objective of defeating the terrorists. We must bring that message home to Moscow, as we did on Monday when the EU suspended work on its next programme of financial and technical aid. But the wider question is how we find the diplomatic strategies that develop Russia as a comfortable, willing partner in the global economy and in global security. Russia has ceased to be an opponent of the West. But that is not enough. We need to work closely with the new Russian leadership, and get across our message to the Russian people that the advantages to Russia of being open to the west, attracting western investment and working together to resolve regional conflicts, vastly outweigh any claimed benefits of a chauvinist isolation. Global interest and national interest The second guiding principle which I set out was that our national interest will more and more coincide with the global interest. This is the one which might appear most strange to the world which Chatham inhabited. In his day foreign policy was a zero sum game, with advantage to one player automatically resulting in disadvantage to another. The balance of power which he pursued expressed the objective of foreign policy as an equilibrium of opposing forces in which the greatest threat to the national interest came from other nations. Today the more immediate challenges to our national interests are likely to be transnational forces - turmoil in financial markets, spread of the drugs trade, or proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. There is no greater national duty than the defence of our shoreline. But the most immediate threat to it today is the encroaching sea, rising as a result of climate change which we can manage only by global action. Some politicians still take a view of the world as a jungle in which the only guiding star is unilateral self-interest. In reality, diplomacy today meets the national interest by forging tactical alliances and building coalitions to secure joint objectives. That is why this government believes that Britain is best served by a foreign policy of enlightened self-interest. The labels of unilateralist and multilateralist have become inverted. It is the parties of the Right, still clinging hopelessly and touchingly to an outdated model of the nation state in isolation, who are the modern unilateralists. It is the parties of the Left of Centre, with their preference for collective solutions, who are better fitted to understand and operate in the modern multilateralist world. Britain has more to gain than any other single state from an orderly international framework for the global economy. We depend for our living on trade. We export more per head than either the US or Japan. In absolute terms, our trade with the wider world is twice as great as at the zenith of Empire. We have a larger portfolio of overseas investment than any other European nation. We have more to lose from instability in the international markets. It is fortunate therefore that Britain also has a broader representation than any other state on the multilateral bodies that will help shape the global economy. We are the only state which is a member of the G8, the EU, NATO, and the Commonwealth, and is a permanent member of the security council. Britain has a unique opportunity to pursue the national interest through the global interest. If Russia is the biggest challenge for critical engagement, reform of the security council is the biggest unresolved question for multilateral diplomacy. The size of the security council and its permanent membership still replicates the world as it was in 1945. The world has moved on. The UN itself has more than trebled in numbers. The security council risks losing credibility unless it more fairly represents the world as it is today. A modest increase in the numbers on the Security Council seems a small price to pay for a big gain in the Council's authority. That would enhance, not dilute, Britain's position as a permanent member. Universal values But even the strongest global institution will sound an uncertain note if it is not clear as to the values which it is meant to promote - which brings me to my third guiding principle, the need for universal values in an age of universal trade and global communications. The Cold War fostered client states whose repressive behaviour was often condoned in return for their loyalty to one or other camp. This was a particular paradox for the West. All too often it found itself in the pursuit of a proclaimed crusade for freedom shoring up regimes for whom freedom was not on the agenda. By contrast, the age of globalisation is creating more progressive pressures. Regimes which govern their citizens by fear and repression cannot expect the same people to display the creativity and innovation in the workplace which are essential for a knowledge-based economy. Respect for human rights is not a luxury of growth, but the condition of that growth. So it is not surprising that democracy has made major gains in the past decade. In Europe the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have chosen democracy. There are no military juntas left in Latin America. In 1975 only three heads of state in Africa were chosen by elections. In 1999, there were 32. The military coup in Pakistan has been so universally condemned precisely because it is out of joint with the times. We support human rights and democracy for other people because these are values we demand for ourselves. That is why the third theme of our foreign policy for the modern age is diplomacy for democracy. Click here for the rest of the speech.",

Israel has also threaten to withdraw its ambassador if Mr Haider is part of a new Austrian government. <p><b>What is his background? </b><br> Born in the upper Austrian town of Bad Goisern in 1950, <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/joerg_haider.html\" target=\"_new\">Mr Haider</a> studied law in Vienna. He became Freedom Party leader in 1986, when the party was barely securing 5% at the polls, and provincial governor of his native Carinthia in 1989. In 1991, Mr Haider was forced to resign after praising the employment policies of Nazi Germany.</p> <p><b>What did he say? </b><br> He is reported to have used \"penal camps\" to describe a concentration camp. He actually said the Romany people in Austria were being marginalised, and asked people to remember that they were almost exterminated in the penal camps of National Socialism. He also said the SS was \"a part of the German army which should be honoured\". In a TV debate last year he compared the deportation of Jews by the Nazis to the expulsion of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after the second world war. But he has described the Third Reich as a heinous criminal regime. More pointedly, he has said that Austria was as responsible as Germany for the seven terrible years of the war.</p> <p><b>What is Austria's political situation? </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.austria.gv.at/e/\" target=\"_new\">Austria</a> has been without a proper government for four months since the inconclusive election in which the Freedom Party surged into second place behind the <a href=\"http://www.spoe.at/\" target=\"_new\">Social Democrats</a>, who hold 65 seats in the <a href=\"http://www.parlinkom.gv.at/pd/doep/e-inh-vz.htm\" target=\"_new\">Austrian parliament</a>. The Freedom Party has 52 as does the People's Party. Mr Haider's success sounded the death-knell of the so-called grand coalition, the political partnership between the Social Democrats and the People's Party, which governed Austria for the last 13 years.</p> <p><b>What was Mr Haider's platform?</b><br> He ran a <a href=\"http://www.fpoe.or.at/englisch/english.htm\" target=\"_new\"> campaign </a> of stopping immigration in a country that has virtually no immigration and he ran a tough-on-crime campaign in a country that has just about the lowest crime rate in the world. Mr Haider also struck a chord with his anti-European stance. In the past he led Austria's anti-EMU campaign and fought vainly to stop Austria joining the EU in 1995. Last year, he failed to force a referendum on the single currency. Not surprisingly, he is also against EU enlargement. During Austria's six-month presidency of the EU he said: \"It is ... a declaration of war against all working and upstanding people.\" Hence the EU's unease about Mr Haider joining the Austrian government.</p> <p><b>Why was he so successful in the last election? </b><br> Although <a href=\"http://www.austria.org/\" target=\"_new\">Austria </a> is one of Europe's richest countries and its unemployment levels lower than ever, Austrians were fed up with the fractious coalition parties, their high taxes, austerity budget and two-party patronage system. Mr Haider promised to change the stagnant political climate and to create what he calls an Austria for Austrians free of immigrants feeding off the country's generous welfare state.</p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/au.html\" target=\"_new\">Austria</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Who is Joerg Haider? He leads Austria's far-right Freedom party and there is every prospect of him joining the Austrian government run by the moderate right People's Party. That possibility has caused dismay in capitals around the world because of his pro-Nazi remarks in the past, although he has issued apologies in recent months. Be that as it may, Belgium has written to the EU's Portuguese presidency to demand a special meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss the prospect of the Freedom Party joining the Austrian government. Israel has also threaten to withdraw its ambassador if Mr Haider is part of a new Austrian government. What is his background? Born in the upper Austrian town of Bad Goisern in 1950, Mr Haider studied law in Vienna. He became Freedom Party leader in 1986, when the party was barely securing 5% at the polls, and provincial governor of his native Carinthia in 1989. In 1991, Mr Haider was forced to resign after praising the employment policies of Nazi Germany. What did he say? He is reported to have used \"penal camps\" to describe a concentration camp. He actually said the Romany people in Austria were being marginalised, and asked people to remember that they were almost exterminated in the penal camps of National Socialism. He also said the SS was \"a part of the German army which should be honoured\". In a TV debate last year he compared the deportation of Jews by the Nazis to the expulsion of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after the second world war. But he has described the Third Reich as a heinous criminal regime. More pointedly, he has said that Austria was as responsible as Germany for the seven terrible years of the war. What is Austria's political situation? Austria has been without a proper government for four months since the inconclusive election in which the Freedom Party surged into second place behind the Social Democrats, who hold 65 seats in the Austrian parliament. The Freedom Party has 52 as does the People's Party. Mr Haider's success sounded the death-knell of the so-called grand coalition, the political partnership between the Social Democrats and the People's Party, which governed Austria for the last 13 years. What was Mr Haider's platform? He ran a campaign of stopping immigration in a country that has virtually no immigration and he ran a tough-on-crime campaign in a country that has just about the lowest crime rate in the world. Mr Haider also struck a chord with his anti-European stance. In the past he led Austria's anti-EMU campaign and fought vainly to stop Austria joining the EU in 1995. Last year, he failed to force a referendum on the single currency. Not surprisingly, he is also against EU enlargement. During Austria's six-month presidency of the EU he said: \"It is ... a declaration of war against all working and upstanding people.\" Hence the EU's unease about Mr Haider joining the Austrian government. Why was he so successful in the last election? Although Austria is one of Europe's richest countries and its unemployment levels lower than ever, Austrians were fed up with the fractious coalition parties, their high taxes, austerity budget and two-party patronage system. Mr Haider promised to change the stagnant political climate and to create what he calls an Austria for Austrians free of immigrants feeding off the country's generous welfare state.

      "trailText": "<p>American Beauty</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The reputation of American Beauty, the cinematic debut of the young British stage director Sam Mendes, has compounded at an extraordinary, exponential rate since its US release. Initially regarded as a witty, literate ensemble piece to be cautiously compared to Ang Lee's Ice Storm, it has become a gigantic screen achievement, now arriving here hailed as the first bang-up classic of the new decade, garlanded with Golden Globes and soon (bet your shirt on it) Oscars. </p> <p>I felt it made a stunning impact at the London film festival in November and although it does not quite withstand the scrutiny of a second viewing, containing as it does elements of redundancy and naivety, it is certainly a film of incredible flair and formal, compositional brilliance. Mendes has assembled his actors like an extremely classy theatrical cast, and, with the help of Alan Ball's terrific screenplay, conjured from them superbly modulated complementary performances, crowned by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as the unhappiest middle-aged couple in all suburbia. </p> <p>Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged ad executive who hates his job and hates his life, whose wife and daughter loathe him, and for whom jerking off in the shower is the only pleasurable experience of the day. (At night, this indulgence is covertly extended to the matrimonial bed next to his sleeping wife.) </p> <p>His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is moody, mopey, grungey and secretly saving up for breast augmentation surgery, of which she has no obvious need, as Mendes later reveals in a scene in which Jane removes her top for the benefit of Ricky, the boy next door who is obsessed with filming her with his Sony DV camera. It is one of many erotic ironies in this picture, through which voyeurism is wilfully confused with rapture. </p> <p>But the real head-case is Carolyn, a failing real-estate saleswoman and Lester's uptight wife. This is an outstanding study in unhappiness from Annette Bening, who gives her best performance since The Grifters. Bening's bright, chipper keeping-up-appearances smile causes her crow's feet to crinkle and clench almost audibly. It is a mask of dysfunction and despair; and there is a compelling scene in which she fails to sell a tatty family home because of its inadequately tropical \"lagoon-style\" pool. After the contemptuous would-be buyers have left, she bursts into hysterical, self-loathing tears, while slapping herself across the face: \"Shut up! Shut up! You're weak!\" </p> <p>They all are. Peeping, wanking, sobbing and yearning, Mendes's characters and their weirdo neighbours drift through a bright suburban moonscape. This is the arena for their hidden lives, and secret, unacknowledged longings - erotic and otherwise - which manifest themselves outwardly in little jolts of disorientation and inattention, the suburban moment when, as Nabokov put it in Lolita, one accidentally sweeps the refrigerator and defrosts the driveway. </p> <p>But all this creepy serenity is blown away when Lester uproariously flowers into a liberating mid-life crisis. He quits his job; he smokes premium-quality dope bought from Ricky and conceives an obsession with Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's unbearably blonde and sexy best friend. </p> <p>All this is managed with magnificent confidence by Mendes, who shows an awe-inspiringly precocious mastery of technique, in part due to canny reliance on his veteran cinematographer Conrad L Hall. Opinion will divide on the dream-setpieces in American Beauty which - a bit artificially - amplify the roses of Carolyn's immaculate garden into the film's central poetic motif. As visionary enactments of erotic languour, they are stagey, pedantic, and a bit soft-core, but certainly entertaining and ingenious. </p> <p>American Beauty has its limits, and its flaws. As a journey into the troubled heart of American suburbia, it has nothing like the power and conviction of, say, Todd Solondz's Happiness or Alexander Payne's Election. Actually, there is a faint trace of saccharine here. When Ricky shows us an 11-minute video he has made of a plastic bag blowing in the wind, we are apparently invited to endorse his glassy-eyed assessment of it as a wonderful epiphany of natural beauty.

      "bodyText": "The reputation of American Beauty, the cinematic debut of the young British stage director Sam Mendes, has compounded at an extraordinary, exponential rate since its US release. Initially regarded as a witty, literate ensemble piece to be cautiously compared to Ang Lee's Ice Storm, it has become a gigantic screen achievement, now arriving here hailed as the first bang-up classic of the new decade, garlanded with Golden Globes and soon (bet your shirt on it) Oscars. I felt it made a stunning impact at the London film festival in November and although it does not quite withstand the scrutiny of a second viewing, containing as it does elements of redundancy and naivety, it is certainly a film of incredible flair and formal, compositional brilliance. Mendes has assembled his actors like an extremely classy theatrical cast, and, with the help of Alan Ball's terrific screenplay, conjured from them superbly modulated complementary performances, crowned by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as the unhappiest middle-aged couple in all suburbia. Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged ad executive who hates his job and hates his life, whose wife and daughter loathe him, and for whom jerking off in the shower is the only pleasurable experience of the day. (At night, this indulgence is covertly extended to the matrimonial bed next to his sleeping wife.) His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is moody, mopey, grungey and secretly saving up for breast augmentation surgery, of which she has no obvious need, as Mendes later reveals in a scene in which Jane removes her top for the benefit of Ricky, the boy next door who is obsessed with filming her with his Sony DV camera. It is one of many erotic ironies in this picture, through which voyeurism is wilfully confused with rapture. But the real head-case is Carolyn, a failing real-estate saleswoman and Lester's uptight wife. This is an outstanding study in unhappiness from Annette Bening, who gives her best performance since The Grifters. Bening's bright, chipper keeping-up-appearances smile causes her crow's feet to crinkle and clench almost audibly. It is a mask of dysfunction and despair; and there is a compelling scene in which she fails to sell a tatty family home because of its inadequately tropical \"lagoon-style\" pool. After the contemptuous would-be buyers have left, she bursts into hysterical, self-loathing tears, while slapping herself across the face: \"Shut up! Shut up! You're weak!\" They all are. Peeping, wanking, sobbing and yearning, Mendes's characters and their weirdo neighbours drift through a bright suburban moonscape. This is the arena for their hidden lives, and secret, unacknowledged longings - erotic and otherwise - which manifest themselves outwardly in little jolts of disorientation and inattention, the suburban moment when, as Nabokov put it in Lolita, one accidentally sweeps the refrigerator and defrosts the driveway. But all this creepy serenity is blown away when Lester uproariously flowers into a liberating mid-life crisis. He quits his job; he smokes premium-quality dope bought from Ricky and conceives an obsession with Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's unbearably blonde and sexy best friend. All this is managed with magnificent confidence by Mendes, who shows an awe-inspiringly precocious mastery of technique, in part due to canny reliance on his veteran cinematographer Conrad L Hall. Opinion will divide on the dream-setpieces in American Beauty which - a bit artificially - amplify the roses of Carolyn's immaculate garden into the film's central poetic motif. As visionary enactments of erotic languour, they are stagey, pedantic, and a bit soft-core, but certainly entertaining and ingenious. American Beauty has its limits, and its flaws. As a journey into the troubled heart of American suburbia, it has nothing like the power and conviction of, say, Todd Solondz's Happiness or Alexander Payne's Election. Actually, there is a faint trace of saccharine here. When Ricky shows us an 11-minute video he has made of a plastic bag blowing in the wind, we are apparently invited to endorse his glassy-eyed assessment of it as a wonderful epiphany of natural beauty. So much beauty in the world, he says, that his heart almost collapses. Yet Ricky is, after all, supposed to be a drug dealer, who invites Jane to run away with him to New York City, where they will live on his earnings. This film makes that sound a sweetly romantic, almost bucolic existence. (I was reminded of a line in Doug Liman's underrated Go: \"Yeah, right, he's the good drug dealer...\") Moreover, there is a structural problem in the fact that a scene has been cut from the end, without which neither the pre-credit sequence, nor the denouement, really make satisfactory sense. But flaws and all, this is intelligent, exhilarating, effervescent film-making, and a remarkable debut from Sam Mendes for whom an Academy Award - along with prizes for Spacey and Bening - would now appear to be in order.",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday 25 January, David Jones' trial date for 13 charges of child abuse was set for 27 November 2000. The Club is dismayed at the decision to postpone the trial for 11 months and to consider the addition of four further charges. </p> <p>The Board is saddened that the British Judicial System appears to be unable to dispense the justice for which it has rightly been known in a swift and efficient manner. </p> <p>The Board is disappointed at the prosecuting authorities apparent practice of drip feeding charges into the system and angered at the effect that this perceived sloth has had on David and his family for the past half year and which now will continue for a further eleven months. Any family man will understand the pressure put upon David over and above that associated with the position of a Premier League Manager.</p> <p>This pressure, and the inability of David to defend himself whilst the case remains sub-judice will in the view of the Board adversely affect the Club. The allegations against David may also affect the Club's commercial relationships and should this be the case it may well be that the Club will take steps to recover any loss in the event of David's acquittal.</p> <p>The setting of a firm trial date has enabled the Board to review its requirements over this period.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday 25 January, David Jones' trial date for 13 charges of child abuse was set for 27 November 2000. The Club is dismayed at the decision to postpone the trial for 11 months and to consider the addition of four further charges. The Board is saddened that the British Judicial System appears to be unable to dispense the justice for which it has rightly been known in a swift and efficient manner. The Board is disappointed at the prosecuting authorities apparent practice of drip feeding charges into the system and angered at the effect that this perceived sloth has had on David and his family for the past half year and which now will continue for a further eleven months. Any family man will understand the pressure put upon David over and above that associated with the position of a Premier League Manager. This pressure, and the inability of David to defend himself whilst the case remains sub-judice will in the view of the Board adversely affect the Club. The allegations against David may also affect the Club's commercial relationships and should this be the case it may well be that the Club will take steps to recover any loss in the event of David's acquittal. The setting of a firm trial date has enabled the Board to review its requirements over this period. After full discussion the Board has put in place measures that will allow David to concentrate fully on his defence and the clearing of his name and at the same time allow the Club to look forward to another year in top flight football. We do not realistically believe that both these priorities can be given the best chance of success whilst David remains in sole charge of playing and training staff management. Accordingly the Board has therefore placed David on a twelve month leave of absence, during which he will continue to be paid, to allow him to concentrate fully on the preparation of his case, and trial, and support his family during what is likely to be a difficult period. His contract of employment is not terminated and no-one should confuse this situation with that of dismissal. The Board also wish to state quite clearly that there is no change in their view David is innocent until proven otherwise. We have therefore considered our management requirements during the intervening period, and are pleased to announce that Glenn Hoddle has signed a twelve month contract to manage the first team.

      "body": "<p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity - and, therefore, such a profound obligation - to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.</p> <p>We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest economic growth in more than 30 years, the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years.</p> <p>Next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. Welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years.</p> <p>My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been. As always, the credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with us to put progress above partisanship.</p> <p>Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: \"America: What went wrong?\"</p> <p>In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.</p> <p>We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our people the tools to solve their own problems.</p> <p>With the smallest federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses, and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime: with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals.</p> <p>We ended welfare as we knew it - requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We have helped parents to succeed at work and at home - with family leave, which 20 million Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one.</p> <p>We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps - while also helping them earn their way through college.</p> <p>In 1992, we had a road map. Today, we have results. More important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let our renewed confidence grow into complacency. We will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed. Because our chance to do good is so great.</p> <p>My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution - of opportunity, responsibility and community. We must be, as we were in the beginning, a new nation.</p> <p>At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight. ... It should be the growing nation with a future which takes the long look ahead.\"</p> <p>Tonight let us take our look long ahead - and set great goals for our nation. To 21st century America, let us pledge that:</p> <p>Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work - and no child will be raised in poverty.</p> <p>We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on earth.</p> <p>We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a cleaner, safer planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity, and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our founders pledged us to be so long ago - one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p> <p>These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them.</p> <p>Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot. The continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history - and the lesson of the last seven years - is that great goals are reached step by step: always building on our progress, always gaining ground.</p> <p>Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. For too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. Let's begin with them.</p> <p>I ask you again to pass a real patient's bill of rights. Pass common-sense gun-safety legislation. Pass campaign finance reform. Vote on long overdue judicial nominations and other important appointees. And, again, I ask you to raise the minimum wage.</p> <p>Two years ago, as we reached our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago: We are actually paying down the national debt. If we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in 13 years and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835.</p> <p>In 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your former colleague, my first secretary of the treasury, led that effort. He is here tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well.</p> <p>Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American - Social Security and Medicare. I ask you tonight to work with me to make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security trust fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for the next 50 years.</p> <p>But this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right steps toward reaching our great goals.</p> <p>First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every child can learn.</p> <p>Because education is more than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all our children have that key.</p> <p>That means quality preschool and after-school, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and college opportunities for all our children.</p> <p>For seven years, we have worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility: Investing more, but demanding more in return.</p> <p>Reading, math, and college entrance scores are up. And some of the most impressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods.</p> <p>All successful schools have followed the same proven formula: Higher standards, more accountability, so all children can reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds states and school districts accountable for progress, and rewards them for results. Each year, the national government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It's time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn't.</p> <p>As we demand more than ever from our schools, we should invest more than ever in our schools. Let's double our investment to help states and districts turn around their worst-performing schools - or shut them down. Let's double our investment in after-school and summer school programs - boosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and out of trouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing school in America the chance to meet high standards.</p> <p>Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight, I ask for another $1 billion to Head Start, the largest increase in the program's history. We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For two years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new, qualified teachers, to lower class sizes in the early grades.</p> <p>This year, I ask you to make it three in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative - to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need.</p> <p>We know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today there are 1,700. I ask you to help us meet our goal of 3,000 by next year.</p> <p>We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet. We're getting there. In 1994, only three percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the vice president's E-rate program, more than half of them are; and 90 percent of our schools have at least one connection to the Internet.</p> <p>But we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious disrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. Tonight, I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent repairs. And again, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms.</p> <p>We should double our bipartisan GEAR UP program to mentor 1.4 million disadvantaged young people for college. And let's offer these students a chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores.</p> <p>To make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For seven years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: Larger Pell grants, more-affordable student loans, education IRAs, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people, 67 percent of high school graduates now go on to college - up almost 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help.</p> <p>I propose a landmark dlrs30-billion college opportunity tax cut - a middle-class tax deduction for up to dlrs10,000 in college tuition costs. We've already made two years of college affordable for all. Now let's make four years of college affordable for all.</p> <p>If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed.</p> <p>We need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families - by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all - raising their children. That means making sure that every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty.</p> <p>From my first days as President, we have worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's Health Insurance Program - CHIP - so that workers who don't have health care coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we've enrolled 2 million children, and we're well on our way to our goal of 5 million.</p> <p>But there are still more than 40 million Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight, I propose that we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low-income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their kids. Together with our children's initiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured in America.</p> <p>Again, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65 - the fastest growing group of uninsured - buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. When the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens - and yet it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden. We must strengthen and modernize Medicare now.</p> <p>My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and competitive. And it dedicates nearly dlrs400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025 - and, at long last, to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs.</p> <p>Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the highest prices for them.</p> <p>In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. Last year, I proposed a dlrs1,000 tax credit for long-term care.</p> <p>Frankly, that wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to dlrs3,000 - and this year, let's pass it.</p> <p>And we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down the barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore.</p> <p>Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare - a big step toward assuring health care for all Americans, young and old.</p> <p>We must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the Earned Income Tax Credit, the EITC. The \"E\" in \"EITC\" is about earning, working, taking responsibility and being rewarded for it. In my first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this tax credit; and you did.</p> <p>As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty and toward the middle class - double the number in 1993.</p> <p>Tonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the marriage penalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as it rewards work. And we should expand the tax credit for families with more than two children to provide up to dlrs 1,100 more in tax relief.</p> <p>We can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. The female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years. Yet women still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn.</p> <p>We must do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act.</p> <p>Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, far away from many low-income families. In the past two years, I have proposed and Congress has approved 110,000 new housing vouchers - rent subsidies to help working families live closer to the workplace.</p> <p>This year, let us more than double that number. If we want people to go to work, they have to be able to get to work.</p> <p>Many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about two million children.</p> <p>My child care initiative, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children.</p> <p>For hard-pressed middle-income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And we should take the next big step. We should make that tax credit refundable for low-income families. For those making under dlrs 30,000 a year, that could mean up to dlrs 2,400 for child-care costs. We all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it.</p> <p>Tens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRAs and 401-K retirement plans. We should do more to help working families save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea behind so-called Individual Development Accounts.</p> <p>Let's take that idea to a new level, with Retirement Savings Accounts that enable every low- and moderate-income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save.</p> <p>And to give a major new tax credit for any small business that provides a meaningful pension to its workers. Nearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a father. These children are five times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home.</p> <p>Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all children out of poverty. We have doubled child support collections since 1992, and I am proposing tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. But we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children - and need help to do it.</p> <p>Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn. got that help. Now he has a good job and he supports his son Ricardo. My budget will help 40,000 fathers make the choices Carlos did. And I thank him for being here.</p> <p>If there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care, supported those who leave it when they turn 18, and dramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive homes. I thank you for that.</p> <p>Of course, I am especially grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now: My wife, Hillary.</p> <p>If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education and support for working families-and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents and reduce the marriage penalty - without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. Indeed, we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt.</p> <p>Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years - the longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws and effective prevention.</p> <p>But nobody believes America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the safest big country in the world. Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire - in addition to the 100,000 community police we have already funded - 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support.</p> <p>Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered common-sense gun safety legislation to require Brady background checks at gun shows, child safety locks for all new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips. With courage - and a tie-breaking vote by the vice president - the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit.</p> <p>We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief.</p> <p>Somehow Tom has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress to make common-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of business. Tom, thank you for being here tonight.</p> <p>We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But again, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the tools to trace every gun - and every bullet - used in a crime in America.</p> <p>Listen to this: The accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is nine times higher than in the other 25 industrialized nations - combined. Technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research in smart gun technology. I also call on responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep our children safe.</p> <p>Every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I thank the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But the ratings are too numerous, diverse and confusing to be really useful to parents.</p> <p>Therefore, I now ask the industry to accept the first lady's challenge - to develop a single, voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment, one that is easier for parents to understand and enforce. If we take all these steps, we will be well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world.</p> <p>To keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses and hire new workers right here in America - in our inner cities, poor rural areas and on Indian reservations.</p> <p>Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the last six months, I have traveled to many of them - joined by many of you, and many far-sighted business people - to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.</p> <p>Everywhere I've gone, I've met talented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. Let's put them to work. For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to it?</p> <p>I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America's new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets. Tonight, I propose a large New Markets tax credit and other incentives to spur dlrs 22 billion in private-sector capital - to create new businesses and new investments in inner cities and rural areas. Empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for five years now. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and create more of them.</p> <p>This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is an American issue. Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined me and the Rev. Jesse Jackson in your home state of Illinois, and committed to working toward our common goal, by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you.</p> <p>We must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep the Community Reinvestment Act strong so all Americans have access to the capital they need to buy homes and build businesses. We need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest rates of poverty.</p> <p>My budget includes a special dlrs 110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Mississippi Delta and dlrs 1 billion to increase economic opportunity, health care, education and law enforcement for Native American communities. In this new century, we should honor our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. I thank leaders and members from both parties who have already expressed an interest in working with us on these efforts.</p> <p>There's another part of our American community in trouble today - our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was a great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods and historically low prices have made times very bad for our farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation and create new markets by expanding our program for bio-based fuels and products.</p> <p>Today, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who have these tools and those who don't.</p> <p>Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills and creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I will invite high-tech leaders to join me on another New Markets tour - to close the digital divide and open opportunity for all our people. I thank the high-tech companies that are already doing so much in this area - and I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will encourage others to join us.</p> <p>If we take these steps, we will go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community. To realize the full possibilities of the new economy, we must reach beyond our own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals, economies and cultures: globalization. It is the central reality of our time.</p> <p>Change this profound is both liberating and threatening. But there is no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other - if we understand, and act on, the new realities of interdependence. We must be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and partner. We cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs.</p> <p>First, we must forge a new consensus on trade. Those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom on the environment and worker protection. Still, open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we know for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas.</p> <p>There is only one direction for America on trade: We must go forward.</p> <p>And we must make developing economies our partners in prosperity - which is why I ask Congress to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean basin trade initiatives. Globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring the world together around democracy, freedom and peace, and to oppose those who would tear it apart.</p> <p>Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world.</p> <p>First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, economic turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom.</p> <p>But think how much has changed in the past decade: thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons eliminated, Russian soldiers serving with ours in the Balkans, Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a thousand years. And in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before.</p> <p>No one can know for sure what direction these great countries will choose. But we must do everything in our power to increase the chance they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of the global community.</p> <p>That is why we must support those Russians struggling for a democratic, prosperous future, continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals and help Russia safeguard weapons and materials that remain.</p> <p>That is why Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations as soon as possible this year. Our markets are already open to China. This agreement will open China's markets to us. And it will advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,129807,00.html\">Continued in part two</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity - and, therefore, such a profound obligation - to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams. We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest economic growth in more than 30 years, the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years. Next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. Welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years. My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been. As always, the credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with us to put progress above partisanship. Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: \"America: What went wrong?\" In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans. We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our people the tools to solve their own problems. With the smallest federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses, and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime: with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals. We ended welfare as we knew it - requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We have helped parents to succeed at work and at home - with family leave, which 20 million Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps - while also helping them earn their way through college. In 1992, we had a road map. Today, we have results. More important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let our renewed confidence grow into complacency. We will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed. Because our chance to do good is so great. My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution - of opportunity, responsibility and community. We must be, as we were in the beginning, a new nation. At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight. ... It should be the growing nation with a future which takes the long look ahead.\" Tonight let us take our look long ahead - and set great goals for our nation. To 21st century America, let us pledge that: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work - and no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on earth. We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a cleaner, safer planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity, and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our founders pledged us to be so long ago - one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot. The continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history - and the lesson of the last seven years - is that great goals are reached step by step: always building on our progress, always gaining ground. Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. For too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. Let's begin with them. I ask you again to pass a real patient's bill of rights. Pass common-sense gun-safety legislation. Pass campaign finance reform. Vote on long overdue judicial nominations and other important appointees. And, again, I ask you to raise the minimum wage. Two years ago, as we reached our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago: We are actually paying down the national debt. If we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in 13 years and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835. In 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your former colleague, my first secretary of the treasury, led that effort. He is here tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well. Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American - Social Security and Medicare. I ask you tonight to work with me to make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security trust fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for the next 50 years. But this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right steps toward reaching our great goals. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every child can learn. Because education is more than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and after-school, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and college opportunities for all our children. For seven years, we have worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility: Investing more, but demanding more in return. Reading, math, and college entrance scores are up. And some of the most impressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods. All successful schools have followed the same proven formula: Higher standards, more accountability, so all children can reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds states and school districts accountable for progress, and rewards them for results. Each year, the national government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It's time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn't. As we demand more than ever from our schools, we should invest more than ever in our schools. Let's double our investment to help states and districts turn around their worst-performing schools - or shut them down. Let's double our investment in after-school and summer school programs - boosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and out of trouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing school in America the chance to meet high standards. Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight, I ask for another $1 billion to Head Start, the largest increase in the program's history. We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For two years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new, qualified teachers, to lower class sizes in the early grades. This year, I ask you to make it three in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative - to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need. We know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today there are 1,700. I ask you to help us meet our goal of 3,000 by next year. We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet. We're getting there. In 1994, only three percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the vice president's E-rate program, more than half of them are; and 90 percent of our schools have at least one connection to the Internet. But we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious disrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. Tonight, I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent repairs. And again, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms. We should double our bipartisan GEAR UP program to mentor 1.4 million disadvantaged young people for college. And let's offer these students a chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores. To make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For seven years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: Larger Pell grants, more-affordable student loans, education IRAs, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people, 67 percent of high school graduates now go on to college - up almost 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. I propose a landmark dlrs30-billion college opportunity tax cut - a middle-class tax deduction for up to dlrs10,000 in college tuition costs. We've already made two years of college affordable for all. Now let's make four years of college affordable for all. If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed. We need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families - by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all - raising their children. That means making sure that every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty. From my first days as President, we have worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's Health Insurance Program - CHIP - so that workers who don't have health care coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we've enrolled 2 million children, and we're well on our way to our goal of 5 million. But there are still more than 40 million Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight, I propose that we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low-income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their kids. Together with our children's initiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured in America. Again, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65 - the fastest growing group of uninsured - buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. When the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens - and yet it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden. We must strengthen and modernize Medicare now. My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and competitive. And it dedicates nearly dlrs400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025 - and, at long last, to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs. Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the highest prices for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. Last year, I proposed a dlrs1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, that wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to dlrs3,000 - and this year, let's pass it. And we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down the barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore. Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare - a big step toward assuring health care for all Americans, young and old. We must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the Earned Income Tax Credit, the EITC. The \"E\" in \"EITC\" is about earning, working, taking responsibility and being rewarded for it. In my first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this tax credit; and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty and toward the middle class - double the number in 1993. Tonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the marriage penalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as it rewards work. And we should expand the tax credit for families with more than two children to provide up to dlrs 1,100 more in tax relief. We can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. The female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years. Yet women still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, far away from many low-income families. In the past two years, I have proposed and Congress has approved 110,000 new housing vouchers - rent subsidies to help working families live closer to the workplace. This year, let us more than double that number. If we want people to go to work, they have to be able to get to work. Many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about two million children. My child care initiative, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children. For hard-pressed middle-income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And we should take the next big step. We should make that tax credit refundable for low-income families. For those making under dlrs 30,000 a year, that could mean up to dlrs 2,400 for child-care costs. We all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it. Tens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRAs and 401-K retirement plans. We should do more to help working families save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea behind so-called Individual Development Accounts. Let's take that idea to a new level, with Retirement Savings Accounts that enable every low- and moderate-income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And to give a major new tax credit for any small business that provides a meaningful pension to its workers. Nearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a father. These children are five times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all children out of poverty. We have doubled child support collections since 1992, and I am proposing tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. But we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children - and need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn. got that help. Now he has a good job and he supports his son Ricardo. My budget will help 40,000 fathers make the choices Carlos did. And I thank him for being here. If there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care, supported those who leave it when they turn 18, and dramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive homes. I thank you for that. Of course, I am especially grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now: My wife, Hillary. If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education and support for working families-and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents and reduce the marriage penalty - without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. Indeed, we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt. Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years - the longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws and effective prevention. But nobody believes America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the safest big country in the world. Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire - in addition to the 100,000 community police we have already funded - 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support. Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered common-sense gun safety legislation to require Brady background checks at gun shows, child safety locks for all new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips. With courage - and a tie-breaking vote by the vice president - the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit. We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow Tom has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress to make common-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of business. Tom, thank you for being here tonight. We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But again, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the tools to trace every gun - and every bullet - used in a crime in America. Listen to this: The accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is nine times higher than in the other 25 industrialized nations - combined. Technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research in smart gun technology. I also call on responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep our children safe. Every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I thank the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But the ratings are too numerous, diverse and confusing to be really useful to parents. Therefore, I now ask the industry to accept the first lady's challenge - to develop a single, voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment, one that is easier for parents to understand and enforce. If we take all these steps, we will be well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world. To keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses and hire new workers right here in America - in our inner cities, poor rural areas and on Indian reservations. Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the last six months, I have traveled to many of them - joined by many of you, and many far-sighted business people - to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Everywhere I've gone, I've met talented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. Let's put them to work. For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to it? I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America's new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets. Tonight, I propose a large New Markets tax credit and other incentives to spur dlrs 22 billion in private-sector capital - to create new businesses and new investments in inner cities and rural areas. Empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for five years now. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and create more of them. This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is an American issue. Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined me and the Rev. Jesse Jackson in your home state of Illinois, and committed to working toward our common goal, by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you. We must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep the Community Reinvestment Act strong so all Americans have access to the capital they need to buy homes and build businesses. We need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest rates of poverty. My budget includes a special dlrs 110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Mississippi Delta and dlrs 1 billion to increase economic opportunity, health care, education and law enforcement for Native American communities. In this new century, we should honor our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. I thank leaders and members from both parties who have already expressed an interest in working with us on these efforts. There's another part of our American community in trouble today - our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was a great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods and historically low prices have made times very bad for our farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation and create new markets by expanding our program for bio-based fuels and products. Today, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who have these tools and those who don't. Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills and creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I will invite high-tech leaders to join me on another New Markets tour - to close the digital divide and open opportunity for all our people. I thank the high-tech companies that are already doing so much in this area - and I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will encourage others to join us. If we take these steps, we will go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community. To realize the full possibilities of the new economy, we must reach beyond our own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals, economies and cultures: globalization. It is the central reality of our time. Change this profound is both liberating and threatening. But there is no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other - if we understand, and act on, the new realities of interdependence. We must be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and partner. We cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs. First, we must forge a new consensus on trade. Those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom on the environment and worker protection. Still, open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we know for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas. There is only one direction for America on trade: We must go forward. And we must make developing economies our partners in prosperity - which is why I ask Congress to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean basin trade initiatives. Globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring the world together around democracy, freedom and peace, and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world. First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, economic turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom. But think how much has changed in the past decade: thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons eliminated, Russian soldiers serving with ours in the Balkans, Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a thousand years. And in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before. No one can know for sure what direction these great countries will choose. But we must do everything in our power to increase the chance they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of the global community. That is why we must support those Russians struggling for a democratic, prosperous future, continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals and help Russia safeguard weapons and materials that remain. That is why Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations as soon as possible this year. Our markets are already open to China. This agreement will open China's markets to us. And it will advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. Continued in part two",

Colour-starved children of the war years were enchanted by the amiably optimistic, fatherly cat hero, with a coat striped like marmalade and eyes as green as gooseberries. Hale's exploitation of the techniques of colour lithography set new standards for children's illustrated books. </p> <p>She was always the observer, looking round and jotting down. Even as a child, she wrote innumerable stories, one about a double dachshund. While seeming to join in the hymns in the little church in Yorkshire, where her grandfather was vicar, she would actually be singing her own song about the adventures of a little pig. </p> <p>The idea of Orlando came to her in Italy, when she was travelling with her husband. The train had pulled into a country station, and there was a voluminous woman standing behind a table selling lemonade. She called out \"Orlando,\" rolling the Italian vowels. A small boy emerged from under the white tablecloth, with hair the colour of a Seville orange. </p> <p>Kathleen had a disorientating childhood. She was born in Lanarkshire, but brought up in Manchester. Her father died when she was five and her mother decided to take over his job as travelling salesman for Chappell's pianos. Into the Orlando saga, Hale wrote much of her own history. While Orlando is her husband, resourceful and faintly priggish, she depicts herself as Twinkle, the coal-black troublemaking kitten - unlovable, the outcast. Grace, Orlando's feminine and rather dotty wife, is the woman Kathleen would have liked to be. </p> <p>She once described herself as someone with a talent for being in the right place at the right time. Bernard Meninsky taught her at the Central School; she became an Augustus John groupie and claimed that his beautiful and taciturn wife, Dorelia, influenced her more than anyone - she remembered Dorelia with an armful of Siamese kittens, and, in her books, the kittens often come in armfuls. Augustus himself makes an appearance as the art master in Orlando's Home Life (1942). </p> <p>Kathleen Hale was part of a very English artistic tradition of mild bohemianism and modest bloodymindedness. \"I broke all the rules of decent behaviour,\" she once said. Her marriage in 1926 to Douglas Maclean, a doctor working in medical research, was unconventional in that it had been suggested by his father, Dr John Maclean, medical superintendent of the London Fever Hospital, whose treatment of Hale for suspected diptheria had led to \"a great and loving friendingship\". Maclean Sr felt that the gap in their ages was too large to marry her himself. </p> <p>Katheleen's marriage to Douglas, a brilliant but depressive man, was semi-detached. Although they had two sons, they kept their interests and friendships separate, hers tending towards the intellectual and the louche. </p> <p>In Paris, in the 1920s, she met Cedric Morris and Lett Haines. She was later a frequent visitor to their Benton End community in Essex, centre of the East Anglian school of painting, where art, gastronomy and horticulture mingled. She had a long liaison with the bisexual Haines, who called her \"Moggy\". He appears in Orlando's Silver Wedding (1944) as the cloth-capped cat napper whose feelings for the feline carry him away. </p> <p>It was Hale who nicknamed Enid Blyton \"the Pied Blighter\". She would never inflict Blyton's books on her own children, despising both the value judgments and the prose style. In the late 1930s, there were few children's books for someone of her outlook to approve of beyond Beatrix Potter, Edward Ardizzone and the Babar books of Jean de Brunhoff. </p> <p>Orlando was born of bedtime necessity. Hale took the Babar books as models. She envisaged a large format book in seven colours. Noel Carrington, of that visionary publisher Country Life, persuaded her that four would be equally effective. Indeed, looking now at the original editions of Orlando one is struck by the extraordinary quality of colour reproduction. Hale always acknowledged how much she owed to her printers, WS Cowell. </p> <p>She once told me how she wrote to reinvent a childhood, to recreate the domestic structure she had so badly lacked. During the war, when families were so dispersed, the cohesive cat clan - living normal human life - had a role to play in keeping up children's morale. David Davies used to read the Orlando books on Children's Hour. </p> <p>Orlando is, of course, a utopian cat who, disliking the world as he finds it, wants to change it. In Orlando Becomes A Doctor, there is a perfect picture of a hospital as it might be. He takes on a French chef to improve his patients' diet; he evolves the ideal cure for the rich, which is to give away half their money to the poor. When you look at him closely, he is terribly alternative. </p> <p>Oddly, however, Hale did not suffer cat lovers gladly. She had a stock response to people who wrote her sentimental letters, suggesting that they should visit a children's home one day a month. </p> <p>She was a brave and abrasive person. When I first met her, she was merely in her 70s. Her husband had died in 1967, and I remember being both awestruck and delighted by the gravel-voiced, crop-headed woman who awaited me in the Oxfordshire stone cottage down the pathway edged with her beloved country flowers. She remained intransigent into her 90s, cracking the cat jokes that became her second nature. It is sad she did not complete her anti-war book about Orlando's Furry Legion. </p> <p>When Hale was 96, her autobiography, A Slender Reputation, finally appeared. The title was taken from Cedric Morris's query, \"Do you mean to tell me Kathleen, that you have hung your slender reputation on the broad shoulders of a eunuch cat?\" Her characteristically witty memoir contains an unforgettable account of her employment as Augustus Johns's secretary at the age of 22, where her most arduous duties entailed trawling the King's Road pubs to find the artist, once his aristocratic sitters had arrived. </p> <p>She was the cat's whiskers at a time when illustration was changing its whole nature.

      "body": "<a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,129800,00.html\">Continued from part one</a> <p>A second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America cannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers. We should be proud of America's role in bringing the Middle East closer than ever to a comprehensive peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse crises between India and Pakistan, defending human rights and religious freedom. </p> <p> And we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo - enabling a million innocent people to return to their homes. When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Capt. John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed forces' skill and bravery, we prevailed without losing a single American in combat. </p> <p> Capt. Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to finish the job you began. </p> <p> A third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. The same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. </p> <p> We must meet this threat: by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals and developing a system to defend against new missile threats - while working to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. </p> <p> I hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build a consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. </p> <p> A fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is not threatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while the rest live on the bare edge of survival. We must do our part, with expanded trade, expanded aid and the expansion of freedom. </p> <p> From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people won the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. We must stand by democracies - like Colombia, fighting narco-traffickers for its people's lives, and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong two-year package to help Colombia win this fight; and I ask for your support. </p> <p> And I will propose tough new legislation to go after what drug barons value most - their money. In a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries so they can invest in education, health and economic growth - as the pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year, Congress made a down payment on America's share. And I ask for your continued support. </p> <p> And America must help more nations break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, AIDS killed 10 times as many people as war did. My budget invests dlrs 150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. Today, I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. Together, we can save millions of lives. </p> <p> Our final challenge is the most important: to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, raises salaries for our servicemen and women, protects our veterans, fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, and makes good on our commitment to pay our U.N. dues and arrears. </p> <p> I ask you to pass this budget and I thank you for the extraordinary support you have given - Republicans and Democrats alike - to our men and women in uniform. I especially want to thank Secretary Cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to our national security - and Janet Cohen, I thank you for tirelessly traveling the world to show our support for the troops. If we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization. </p> <p> I am grateful for the opportunities the vice president and I have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the notion that you can't expand the economy while protecting the environment. As our economy has grown, we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste and ensured cleaner air and water for millions of families. In the past three months alone, we have acted to preserve more than 40 million acres of roadless lands in our national forests and created three new national monuments. </p> <p> But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow as well. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore wildlife, protect coastlines and save natural treasures from California redwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment represents by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed. </p> <p> Last year, the vice president launched a new effort to help make communities more livable - so children will grow up next to parks, not parking lots, and parents can be home with their children instead of stuck in traffic. Tonight, we propose new funding for advanced transit systems - for saving precious open spaces - for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. </p> <p> The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. Scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will be flooded, economies disrupted. Many people in the United States and around the world still believe we can't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. In the Industrial Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, it isn't. </p> <p> New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth. For example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon - the fruits of a unique research partnership between government and industry. Before you know it, efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gas. </p> <p> To speed innovations in environmental technologies, I propose giving major tax incentives to businesses for the production of clean energy - and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of super-efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also call on the auto industry to use available technologies to make all new cars more fuel efficient right away. And on Congress to make more of our clean-energy technologies available to the developing world - creating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home. </p> <p> In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be the key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. </p> <p> Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome - the very blueprint of life. It is important for all Americans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this research - and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. </p> <p> For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer - and they are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty genes for good. Researchers are already using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and microchips that would directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and allow people who are now paralyzed to stand up and walk. </p> <p> Science and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology alone now accounts for a third of our economic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private sector average. </p> <p> Again, we should keep in mind: Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet and communications satellites into being. Soon, researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can speak, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight and molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest supercomputers. </p> <p> To accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of science and technology, my budget includes an unprecedented $3 billion increase in the 21st Century Research Fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. These new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most cherished values. </p> <p>First and foremost, we must safeguard our citizens' privacy. Last year, we proposed rules to protect every citizen's medical records. This year, we will finalize those rules. We have also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card statements and other financial records. Soon, I will send legislation to the Congress to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination by employers or insurers. </p> <p>These steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology - enhancing our health, environment, and economy in ways we cannot even imagine today. At a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national communities. </p> <p>No tie binds different people together like citizen service. There is a new spirit of service in America; a movement we have supported with AmeriCorps, an expanded Peace Corps, and unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, and community groups. Partnerships to enlist 12,000 companies in moving 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work. To battle drug abuse and AIDS. To teach young people to read. To save America's treasures. To strengthen the arts. To fight teen pregnancy. To prevent youth violence. To promote racial healing. </p> <p>We can do even more to help Americans help each other. We should help faith-based organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help young people get back on the right track with initiatives like second-chance homes to help unwed teen mothers. </p> <p>We should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities, but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight, I propose new tax incentives to allow low- and middle-income citizens to get that deduction. </p> <p>We should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the American community - investing more to teach them civics and English. And since everyone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone is counted in this year's census. </p> <p> Within 10 years there will be no majority race in our largest state, California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members from virtually every racial, ethnic and religious background. And America is stronger for it. </p> <p>But as we have seen, these differences all too often spark hatred and division, even here at home. We have seen a man dragged to death in Texas simply because he was black; a young man murdered in Wyoming simply because he was gay. In the last year alone, we've seen the shootings of African Americans, Asian Americans, and Jewish children simply because of who they were. This is not the American way. We must draw the line. </p> <p>Without delay, we must pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And we should reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. </p> <p>No American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. </p> <p>Tonight, I propose the largest ever investment to enforce America's civil rights laws. Protections in law must be protections in fact. </p> <p>Last February, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That's what Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as baseball's all-time homerun king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought Americans together. We're pleased he's with us tonight. </p> <p>This fall, at the White House, one of America's leading scientists said something we should all remember. He said all human beings, genetically, are 99.9 percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient faith has always taught: </p> <p>The most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity - we must honor it and celebrate it. </p> <p>My fellow Americans, each time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with great hope and expectations for our nation. But tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we see the great expanse of American achievement; before us, even grander frontiers of possibility. We should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity and progress; with awe and joy at what lies ahead; and with absolute determination to make the most of it. </p> <p>When the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the sun, low on the horizon. He said, \"I have often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it is a rising sun.\" </p> <p>Well, today, because each generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we still bask in the warmth of Mr. Franklin.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Continued from part one A second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America cannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers. We should be proud of America's role in bringing the Middle East closer than ever to a comprehensive peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse crises between India and Pakistan, defending human rights and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo - enabling a million innocent people to return to their homes. When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Capt. John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed forces' skill and bravery, we prevailed without losing a single American in combat. Capt. Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to finish the job you began. A third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. The same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. We must meet this threat: by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals and developing a system to defend against new missile threats - while working to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. I hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build a consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is not threatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while the rest live on the bare edge of survival. We must do our part, with expanded trade, expanded aid and the expansion of freedom. From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people won the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. We must stand by democracies - like Colombia, fighting narco-traffickers for its people's lives, and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong two-year package to help Colombia win this fight; and I ask for your support. And I will propose tough new legislation to go after what drug barons value most - their money. In a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries so they can invest in education, health and economic growth - as the pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year, Congress made a down payment on America's share. And I ask for your continued support. And America must help more nations break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, AIDS killed 10 times as many people as war did. My budget invests dlrs 150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. Today, I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. Together, we can save millions of lives. Our final challenge is the most important: to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, raises salaries for our servicemen and women, protects our veterans, fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, and makes good on our commitment to pay our U.N. dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget and I thank you for the extraordinary support you have given - Republicans and Democrats alike - to our men and women in uniform. I especially want to thank Secretary Cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to our national security - and Janet Cohen, I thank you for tirelessly traveling the world to show our support for the troops. If we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization. I am grateful for the opportunities the vice president and I have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the notion that you can't expand the economy while protecting the environment. As our economy has grown, we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste and ensured cleaner air and water for millions of families. In the past three months alone, we have acted to preserve more than 40 million acres of roadless lands in our national forests and created three new national monuments. But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow as well. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore wildlife, protect coastlines and save natural treasures from California redwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment represents by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed. Last year, the vice president launched a new effort to help make communities more livable - so children will grow up next to parks, not parking lots, and parents can be home with their children instead of stuck in traffic. Tonight, we propose new funding for advanced transit systems - for saving precious open spaces - for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. Scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will be flooded, economies disrupted. Many people in the United States and around the world still believe we can't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. In the Industrial Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, it isn't. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth. For example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon - the fruits of a unique research partnership between government and industry. Before you know it, efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gas. To speed innovations in environmental technologies, I propose giving major tax incentives to businesses for the production of clean energy - and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of super-efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also call on the auto industry to use available technologies to make all new cars more fuel efficient right away. And on Congress to make more of our clean-energy technologies available to the developing world - creating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home. In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be the key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome - the very blueprint of life. It is important for all Americans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this research - and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer - and they are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty genes for good. Researchers are already using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and microchips that would directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and allow people who are now paralyzed to stand up and walk. Science and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology alone now accounts for a third of our economic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we should keep in mind: Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet and communications satellites into being. Soon, researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can speak, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight and molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest supercomputers. To accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of science and technology, my budget includes an unprecedented $3 billion increase in the 21st Century Research Fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. These new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most cherished values. First and foremost, we must safeguard our citizens' privacy. Last year, we proposed rules to protect every citizen's medical records. This year, we will finalize those rules. We have also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card statements and other financial records. Soon, I will send legislation to the Congress to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination by employers or insurers. These steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology - enhancing our health, environment, and economy in ways we cannot even imagine today. At a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national communities. No tie binds different people together like citizen service. There is a new spirit of service in America; a movement we have supported with AmeriCorps, an expanded Peace Corps, and unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, and community groups. Partnerships to enlist 12,000 companies in moving 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work. To battle drug abuse and AIDS. To teach young people to read. To save America's treasures. To strengthen the arts. To fight teen pregnancy. To prevent youth violence. To promote racial healing. We can do even more to help Americans help each other. We should help faith-based organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help young people get back on the right track with initiatives like second-chance homes to help unwed teen mothers. We should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities, but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight, I propose new tax incentives to allow low- and middle-income citizens to get that deduction. We should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the American community - investing more to teach them civics and English. And since everyone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone is counted in this year's census. Within 10 years there will be no majority race in our largest state, California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members from virtually every racial, ethnic and religious background. And America is stronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all too often spark hatred and division, even here at home. We have seen a man dragged to death in Texas simply because he was black; a young man murdered in Wyoming simply because he was gay. In the last year alone, we've seen the shootings of African Americans, Asian Americans, and Jewish children simply because of who they were. This is not the American way. We must draw the line. Without delay, we must pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And we should reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. No American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Tonight, I propose the largest ever investment to enforce America's civil rights laws. Protections in law must be protections in fact. Last February, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That's what Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as baseball's all-time homerun king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought Americans together. We're pleased he's with us tonight. This fall, at the White House, one of America's leading scientists said something we should all remember. He said all human beings, genetically, are 99.9 percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient faith has always taught: The most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity - we must honor it and celebrate it. My fellow Americans, each time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with great hope and expectations for our nation. But tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we see the great expanse of American achievement; before us, even grander frontiers of possibility. We should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity and progress; with awe and joy at what lies ahead; and with absolute determination to make the most of it. When the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the sun, low on the horizon. He said, \"I have often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it is a rising sun.\" Well, today, because each generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we still bask in the warmth of Mr. Franklin.",

      "body": "<p>A young, slightly giddy man introduces Danny Boyle, John Hodge and Andrew Macdonald - the hottest movie team in Britain, the sizzlers who brought you Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. There is polite applause. We're in Dublin for the Republic's premiere of their biggest film, The Beach. \"And as an extra special surprise, welcome to Mr Leonardo Di...\" The audience shares a collective palpitation. \"...Actually, he couldn't make it tonight\". The giggly anticlimactic groan is deafening. </p> <p>The Beach cost $50m to make. Close on half the budget was spent on its star - gorgeous, pouting Leo. Actually, DiCaprio is not simply the movie's star, he is the film. A few years ago it would have seemed perfectly logical to cast DiCaprio in a BHM movie. After all, he was a fine actor who made adventurous independent movies like What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, The Basketball Diaries and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Then came Titanic, Leonardo won the world and lost his past. He was no longer an actor - simply the biggest star in the world. </p> <p>The team is now touring the movie before its official release like pop stars. Only, it's as if Boyzone had left Ronan Keating at home. \"It's funny,\" says Boyle, \"We were in Belfast the other night and the audience didn't ask us a single question. It was only afterwards that I realised the guy who'd introduced us said you can ask them anything so long as you don't ask about Leonardo.\" </p> <p>He retains the flat vowels of his Lancashire childhood, and often talks about the fantasy age when Bury were a football club to be reckoned with. Writer Hodge (who worked as a doctor until three years ago) and producer Macdonald (a grandson of the great screenwriter Emeric Pressburger) are both Scottish and in their mid-30s, a few years younger than Boyle. </p> <p>With Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, they changed the landscape of British film. They were taut, manic black comedies, the filmic equivalent of the three-minute pop song. They laugh at the notion that they had a manifesto, but actually it's not so far from the truth. They knew exactly what they wanted to do, and what they didn't want to do. Macdonald talks disparagingly about victim movies, and says it would be easier for him to name the three British movies he liked before they came along rather than the ones he hated - The Hit, The Long Good Friday and Gregory's Girl. </p> <p>\"When we started out we didn't want to make art films. The art house ghetto is an easy place to flee to,\" says Boyle. \"You know the kind of thing - you don't understand this film, do you? It's not for you, it's for other people.\" He knows what he's talking about. Boyle has a consummate arty background having spent his late childhood glued to Bu\u00f1uel and Chabrol films in dingy rep cinemas, followed by years directing at the Royal Court, home of radical theatre. </p> <p>Nor did they want to make mainstream films. They aspired to the hybrid model of Americans like Spike Lee and the Coens and Steven Soderbergh - indiestream, if you like. </p> <p>The trouble with British film-makers was that they made their films in a vacuum, argues Macdonald. \"People were incapable of understanding who the audience were... people under 25. It doesn't take a genius to understand that. Tony Blair knows who his audience is. He worked out exactly who they were, and then he went for them.\" </p> <p>As did BHM. Such ruthless branding is not surprising when you see the films, but it is when you meet them. As I walk into the room, Boyle is moaning about the macho culture of film-making, Hodge is so retiring he's invisible, and Macdonald apologises for his earnest nerdishness as he tells me of the 1,001 films he would love to have made. </p> <p>Critics suggest their work is derivative, that they are opportunists. None of the team is likely to disagree. \"I mean, Trainspotting is just nicked off GoodFellas, really,\" says Boyle. \"It's just a lift really in terms of style. But that's one thing we try to do, we try to own up to how 'indebted' we are to our predecessors.\" He scratches his recidivist post-punk spikes. \"That's a polite way of putting it.\" </p> <p>Macdonald says their best film is not as good as Scorsese's worst. </p> <p>This is crunch time for the boys. Never have they been so powerful, never so vulnerable. Their third film, A Life Less Ordinary, was a commercial and critical failure. It was backed by Rupert Murdoch's Fox, which has given them another chance with The Beach. But Murdoch is careful with his money. Success is measured strictly in terms of box office. And if it doesn't succeed in America it will have failed full stop. It's also critical because having created a niche in trendy youth movies, they already feel they're getting old, past it. And they don't really fancy becoming a Jaggeresque parody of themselves. </p> <p>Why did they cast DiCaprio? For one, they say Alex Garland's novel about a backpacker who discovers purgatory in paradise was too English, so they wanted to broaden it out. Second, says Macdonald, \"One of the things that really interests us is taking someone well known for two or three films, and playing with his image.\" It's an interesting rationale. </p> <p>But perhaps the truth lies more in what Boyle said earlier in the day: \"Essentially, you go and watch movies these days for the actors. An audience lives the film through actors, they have to believe the actors. Hence the star system. You have to have a degree of humility about that.\" </p> <p>The Beach is an unmistakable BHM film - fast, febrile and pounding with dance beats. At times the characters seem like a backdrop to the soundtrack. While Trainspotting and Shallow Grave had small casts and were perfectly formed team movies, The Beach has an enormous cast and only one actor matters. Hodge and Boyle have almost been reduced to operatives in the process. And however much they praise DiCaprio's attitude, his professionalism, the way he turned up every day, you can't help sensing they feel they've emasculated themselves. </p> <p>Macdonald says: \"Taking on Leo was the biggest decision we made. It's not known as Danny Boyle's Beach or the people who made Trainspotting's Beach, or Alex Garland's Beach. It's only known for one thing now... and that's great... but you know everything rests on that now.\" </p> <p>When interviewed as a team, they verge on the insouciant. The previous night at the movie's Dublin launch party, I spoke to them individually, and they were more open. Macdonald said it's a sticky time, that Fox is anxious about The Beach. It's no secret. This week's movie trade magazine Variety led with the headline, \"Fox brass muscles buzz: Studio hype muted as marketers hit The Beach\". The story revealed that the studio was cutting back on promotion to damp down expectation that cannot be realised. The movie will never be another Titanic - though to be fair, it was never intended to be. </p> <p>In Britain the film is rated 15, which is enough of a problem. But in the US, it is rated R (you have to be 17 to see it), which could be disastrous. Macdonald said this was their fear. \"Most of Leo's fans are young girls who won't be able to see the film. The ideal audience is young men, but they may not want to see it because it stars Leo. They may get turned off because they think of DiCaprio as a romantic star who their girlfriends fancy.\" </p> <p>All three look the part - younger than their years, trendy, the right jeans, jackets, kiddie trainers. It can create a misleading impression. At the party they stuffed themselves into the first obscured sofa. \"Where are the celebrities?\" asked Boyle with mock disappointment. \"Where are the Corrs? Where's Neil Jordan?\" He looked relieved he didn't know anyone. More opportunity to talk football, books and admire the mute action movie playing out in the background. </p> <p>\"We're not clubbers or anything,\" says Boyle understatedly. </p> <p>John Hodge quietly adds \"If you had an exciting life you wouldn't need to go out and make films about it.\" </p> <p>Boyle has three children, Macdonald one, Hodge has one on the way. \"The reason we get on is that none of us talks too much,\" says Hodge tersely. Boyle says in a way they are similar people, and their values are reflected in their films. \"The morality is old-fashioned. I don't think they're moralistic, but the morality is quite old-fashioned.\" How? \"The hedonism that is in all the films is clearly disapproved of, clearly disapproved of.\"</p> <p>In Shallow Grave, the characters steal a dead man's money and discover it doesn't buy happiness; in Trainspotting, the junkies find endless misery; in A Life Less Ordinary a romantic kidnap caper ends bloodily; in The Beach Leonardo discovers his heart of darkness. Hodge says: \"What you said before sums it up. In our films you have a few thrills, and then things go wrong.\" </p> <p>Suddenly they're into a discussion about movies that could last forever. \"There is an alarming moment when you're making a film and you think basically it's just the same one,\" says Hodge. Look at the greats, they say, again citing Scorsese - they've also made the same film all their lives. </p> <p>\"The only difference is that you tend to have a halcyon period at the beginning, 10 years if you're lucky,\" says Boyle. </p> <p>Today, Macdonald is more upbeat about The Beach. Instead of talking about his worries, he talks about the challenge of casting DiCaprio. \"A lot of people, friends and family of mine who are not in the business, say 'Ooh, why are you casting Leonardo DiCaprio? He's a girl, he's too young, he won't be right.' And they see the film and think he's fantastic.\" </p> <p>\"He's very good in it, isn't he?\" he asks, looking for confirmation. DiCaprio is pretty good in the entertaining if baggy movie. But this is not the uninhibited DiCaprio of early days. He can't afford to be. If you're paying $20m for him, he has to play to his perceived strengths - so instead of the unrequited voyeur of the novel, DiCaprio's Richard is a glistening irresistible anti-hero who gets the women. </p> <p>We are walking to the park to have photos taken. I ask Macdonald if he really meant it when he said earlier that if The Beach fails this could be the end of the team. \"Well I think you have to blame somebody in failure, and I think you end up blaming each other quite naturally. If you don't make films that are successful together then you probably won't continue making them together. Failure is the thing that nearly always splits up teams.\" </p> <p>The trio are forced into a Reservoir Dogs style strut for the photographer, and they obviously feel uneasy. \"You can't expect us to do this without shades,\" says Boyle. Hodge asks why we need photos of them at all when we could use a lovely glossy Leo. </p> <p>The experience of making The Beach has been nothing like the three other movies. Throughout its three-year gestation, it's never been far from the headlines. There were stories about Ewan McGregor, who had starred in the other movies, being peeved that his part had gone to DiCaprio.</p> <p>The strange thing is that McGregor, who was unknown when he starred in Shallow Grave, is now a big enough star to take the lead in Star Wars, but apparently not big enough to star in a BHM film. \"Ewan is not the only one who's upset that he didn't work on the film,\" says Macdonald. \"There's a brilliant cameraman, Brian Tufano, who's not very happy either, but nobody cares about him because it's nothing to do with Leo.\" </p> <p>Then there were stories about the environment - Leo wrecks paradise, that kind of thing. Not only did the press get it wrong, says Macdonald with disgust, not only did it fail to mention that Thai locals were suing the government rather than the film-makers, \"but the papers don't even care about the environment. It's just showbusiness dressed up as serious news\". </p> <p>But isn't that the way the world is going - for anything to be newsworthy, there must be a celebrity peg? \"Yes,\" says Boyle. \"It's a big problem, isn't it?\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Beach is released on February 11.</p>",

While Trainspotting and Shallow Grave had small casts and were perfectly formed team movies, The Beach has an enormous cast and only one actor matters. Hodge and Boyle have almost been reduced to operatives in the process. And however much they praise DiCaprio's attitude, his professionalism, the way he turned up every day, you can't help sensing they feel they've emasculated themselves. Macdonald says: \"Taking on Leo was the biggest decision we made. It's not known as Danny Boyle's Beach or the people who made Trainspotting's Beach, or Alex Garland's Beach. It's only known for one thing now... and that's great... but you know everything rests on that now.\" When interviewed as a team, they verge on the insouciant. The previous night at the movie's Dublin launch party, I spoke to them individually, and they were more open. Macdonald said it's a sticky time, that Fox is anxious about The Beach. It's no secret. This week's movie trade magazine Variety led with the headline, \"Fox brass muscles buzz: Studio hype muted as marketers hit The Beach\". The story revealed that the studio was cutting back on promotion to damp down expectation that cannot be realised. The movie will never be another Titanic - though to be fair, it was never intended to be. In Britain the film is rated 15, which is enough of a problem. But in the US, it is rated R (you have to be 17 to see it), which could be disastrous. Macdonald said this was their fear. \"Most of Leo's fans are young girls who won't be able to see the film. The ideal audience is young men, but they may not want to see it because it stars Leo. They may get turned off because they think of DiCaprio as a romantic star who their girlfriends fancy.\" All three look the part - younger than their years, trendy, the right jeans, jackets, kiddie trainers. It can create a misleading impression. At the party they stuffed themselves into the first obscured sofa. \"Where are the celebrities?\" asked Boyle with mock disappointment. \"Where are the Corrs? Where's Neil Jordan?\" He looked relieved he didn't know anyone. More opportunity to talk football, books and admire the mute action movie playing out in the background. \"We're not clubbers or anything,\" says Boyle understatedly. John Hodge quietly adds \"If you had an exciting life you wouldn't need to go out and make films about it.\" Boyle has three children, Macdonald one, Hodge has one on the way. \"The reason we get on is that none of us talks too much,\" says Hodge tersely. Boyle says in a way they are similar people, and their values are reflected in their films. \"The morality is old-fashioned. I don't think they're moralistic, but the morality is quite old-fashioned.\" How? \"The hedonism that is in all the films is clearly disapproved of, clearly disapproved of.\" In Shallow Grave, the characters steal a dead man's money and discover it doesn't buy happiness; in Trainspotting, the junkies find endless misery; in A Life Less Ordinary a romantic kidnap caper ends bloodily; in The Beach Leonardo discovers his heart of darkness. Hodge says: \"What you said before sums it up. In our films you have a few thrills, and then things go wrong.\" Suddenly they're into a discussion about movies that could last forever. \"There is an alarming moment when you're making a film and you think basically it's just the same one,\" says Hodge. Look at the greats, they say, again citing Scorsese - they've also made the same film all their lives. \"The only difference is that you tend to have a halcyon period at the beginning, 10 years if you're lucky,\" says Boyle. Today, Macdonald is more upbeat about The Beach. Instead of talking about his worries, he talks about the challenge of casting DiCaprio. \"A lot of people, friends and family of mine who are not in the business, say 'Ooh, why are you casting Leonardo DiCaprio? He's a girl, he's too young, he won't be right.' And they see the film and think he's fantastic.\" \"He's very good in it, isn't he?\" he asks, looking for confirmation. DiCaprio is pretty good in the entertaining if baggy movie. But this is not the uninhibited DiCaprio of early days. He can't afford to be. If you're paying $20m for him, he has to play to his perceived strengths - so instead of the unrequited voyeur of the novel, DiCaprio's Richard is a glistening irresistible anti-hero who gets the women. We are walking to the park to have photos taken. I ask Macdonald if he really meant it when he said earlier that if The Beach fails this could be the end of the team. \"Well I think you have to blame somebody in failure, and I think you end up blaming each other quite naturally. If you don't make films that are successful together then you probably won't continue making them together. Failure is the thing that nearly always splits up teams.\" The trio are forced into a Reservoir Dogs style strut for the photographer, and they obviously feel uneasy. \"You can't expect us to do this without shades,\" says Boyle. Hodge asks why we need photos of them at all when we could use a lovely glossy Leo. The experience of making The Beach has been nothing like the three other movies. Throughout its three-year gestation, it's never been far from the headlines. There were stories about Ewan McGregor, who had starred in the other movies, being peeved that his part had gone to DiCaprio. The strange thing is that McGregor, who was unknown when he starred in Shallow Grave, is now a big enough star to take the lead in Star Wars, but apparently not big enough to star in a BHM film. \"Ewan is not the only one who's upset that he didn't work on the film,\" says Macdonald. \"There's a brilliant cameraman, Brian Tufano, who's not very happy either, but nobody cares about him because it's nothing to do with Leo.\" Then there were stories about the environment - Leo wrecks paradise, that kind of thing. Not only did the press get it wrong, says Macdonald with disgust, not only did it fail to mention that Thai locals were suing the government rather than the film-makers, \"but the papers don't even care about the environment. It's just showbusiness dressed up as serious news\". But isn't that the way the world is going - for anything to be newsworthy, there must be a celebrity peg? \"Yes,\" says Boyle. \"It's a big problem, isn't it?\" \u0095 The Beach is released on February 11.",

Kerry Lauerman, Salon In a lengthy speech that included partisan gibes and conciliatory gestures, soaring rhetoric and a humorous bumble, Clinton's biggest surprise was his call for mandatory photo licenses and safety training for all handgun buyers. Charles Babington, Washington Post President Clinton, in his final state of the union speech, last night demanded licenses for new handguns - siding with vice president Al Gore in his gun duel with Bill Bradley\u0085 A smiling Gore - who was seated prominently behind Clinton in the elegant House chamber and wants to replace him in the White House - has duked it out with Bradley over how far to go in cracking down on guns. Bradley wants licenses for new and old guns. Marilyn Rauber, New York Post The president offered a long litany of initiatives, many of them sure to be rewritten or ignored by Congress. His tax cut proposals were intended primarily to promote educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care for lower- and middle-income Americans\u0085 Most of the proposals were released in advance but the White House withheld Clinton's gun licensing measure until the last minute to build suspense. Boston.com Election-year Congresses are notoriously unproductive, but tonight Mr Clinton advanced some proposals designed to win congressional backing this year and other initiatives designed to linger for the Democrats until well beyond election day. Marc Lacey, the New York Times Each year, Clinton has trotted out a similar - in some instances identical - laundry list, each year he is criticised for it, and at the end of each year very little legislation has been passed. So why do it? \u0085Ironically enough, it is this final laundry-list agenda - a sort of Clinton's greatest hits - that actually has a chance of seeing some of its disparate pieces come to fruition.

A clear distinction must be made between the two.\" </p> <p>Mr Cook will today call the EU one of the most successful economic models yet, securing immense gains for its peoples. \"Objectively, it is the Euro-sceptics who are undermining the national interest by opposing constructive engagement with Europe,\" he will say.</p>",

The Conservative leader, William Hague, who hopes that defence of the pound can be turned into a vote-winner, called the day \"a Downing Street fiasco\", adding that Mr Blair wanted to take Britain in \"as soon as he can get away with it\". Mr Byers, at a Britain in Europe conference in the City, said the opposition was questioning Britain's continued membership of the EU, but stuck to the cabinet line in a speech cleared with Downing Street and the treasury. \"We want the single currency to succeed. It is in the interests of Britain and Europe to have a successful single currency,\" he said, while stressing that the cabinet will go for the referendum only if the economic benefits of joining are clear. Although a survey this week showed Britain was the second most popular destination for inward investment after the US last year, Mr Byers is worried that the flow may dry up if the government fails to make a decision on the subject early in the next parliament. In a passage designed to steer a third way between hardliners on both sides on the euro debate, Mr Byers said: \"It would be wrong for any government to bounce the British people into a referendum on the euro in the immediate aftermath of the next general election. A clear distinction must be made between the two.\" Mr Cook will today call the EU one of the most successful economic models yet, securing immense gains for its peoples. \"Objectively, it is the Euro-sceptics who are undermining the national interest by opposing constructive engagement with Europe,\" he will say.",

Mr Putin, whose whirlwind political ascent has coincided with his prosecution of the war in Chechnya, insisted the increase in spending this year was not related to the north Caucasus campaign, and he argued that the extra funds were essential to reverse years of Russian military decline. \"The army has been underfinanced for several years, entailing negative consequences for the nation's defence potential,\" Mr Putin said. \"It has raised doubts about the very possibility for Russia to have a modern army equipped with state-of-the art weapons.\" He said spending on military procurement would increase by 50% this year. The deputy prime minister responsible for the defence industry, Ilya Klebanov, said spending on arms purchases would go up by 80%, as would funding for military research and development. As Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, arrived in Moscow to press Mr Putin to begin negotiations in Chechnya, the Council of Europe gave Russia three months to show progress towards peace or face suspension. But the council's parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg rejected a proposal for an immediate expulsion of 36 Russian legislators. Earlier Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, told the parliamentary assembly that Russian troops in Chechnya were defending Europe's common borders against \"a barbarian invasion of international terrorism\". Boosting Russian military might has rapidly become a central theme of the new Putin era in Russia. Since being appointed prime minister last August, Mr Putin, has spearheaded the Chechnya war, courted the military lobby, released extra funds for the campaign in the Caucasus and promised to expand the defence budget by 57%. Since succeeding Boris Yeltsin as president on New Year's Eve, Mr Putin has emphasised the need to stop the rot in the Russian military and also signalled that he sees the defence sector as a key to economic regeneration in Russia. \"The defence industries account for a considerable part of the whole of the national economy.

      "body": "<p>Within an hour of the Royal College of Surgeons receiving the call for help from Carmarthenshire NHS Trust, two of the top urological surgeons in the country were speeding towards Wales. </p> <p>Ever since the scandal at Bristol Royal Infirmary which did so much to undermine public confidence in hospital doctors, the college has been ready to put together rapid response teams. The Bristol tragedy - the high death rates among babies undergoing heart surgery at the hands of two surgeons - was hugely damaging and the college has been determined to prevent anything similar happening again. </p> <p>Surgeon John Roberts removed the wrong kidney of his patient Graham Reeves at the Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli on Monday. The trust called the college and the college called the top people in the field. </p> <p>Fletcher Deane, based in Glasgow, is the president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons. Keith Parsons is a consultant urologist and chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broad green University Hospital NHS trust. They dropped everything, because each time a scandal breaks, the leaders of the profession know there is potential for yet more damage to its standing. Self-regulation has been on the line since Bristol and the government's proposed reforms are already set to undermine doctors' traditional independence. </p> <p>The college launched its rapid response procedures just ahead of the government's announcement of an inspectorate called the commission for health improvement.

      "bodyText": "Within an hour of the Royal College of Surgeons receiving the call for help from Carmarthenshire NHS Trust, two of the top urological surgeons in the country were speeding towards Wales. Ever since the scandal at Bristol Royal Infirmary which did so much to undermine public confidence in hospital doctors, the college has been ready to put together rapid response teams. The Bristol tragedy - the high death rates among babies undergoing heart surgery at the hands of two surgeons - was hugely damaging and the college has been determined to prevent anything similar happening again. Surgeon John Roberts removed the wrong kidney of his patient Graham Reeves at the Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli on Monday. The trust called the college and the college called the top people in the field. Fletcher Deane, based in Glasgow, is the president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons. Keith Parsons is a consultant urologist and chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broad green University Hospital NHS trust. They dropped everything, because each time a scandal breaks, the leaders of the profession know there is potential for yet more damage to its standing. Self-regulation has been on the line since Bristol and the government's proposed reforms are already set to undermine doctors' traditional independence. The college launched its rapid response procedures just ahead of the government's announcement of an inspectorate called the commission for health improvement. If the reforms go through, it will be the commission, not the profession, that sends in the trouble-shooters. The inquiry by Mr Deane and Mr Parsons is tinvestigating the surgeon, Mr Roberts, and examining the case notes. The trust has also set in train an internal inquiry which will examine the role of the team in the operation. None of this should take long. The removal of a diseased kidney is straightforward. Mike Jones, the trust's chief executive, said: \"We are not talking about the skills of the surgical team, but something which has gone terribly wrong with the procedures, which are well tried and tested, and it's very difficult to explain it at face value.\" The position of the kidney to be removed should be well documented in the case notes, and is marked in ink on the patient's body before the operation begins. Neither inquiry is supposed to be investigating the earlier operation by Mr Roberts to remove an oversized prostate gland, after which the patient died from complications. All surgeons sometimes lose patients and this one, according to Peter Thomas, medical director of the trust, was \"very high risk\". Mr Roberts was reprimanded. \"I did have cause to speak to him and tell him to be careful... We have reason to believe he is a responsible surgeon,\" said Dr Thomas. Mr Roberts's suspension from the Ysbyty Gwynedd general hospital in Bangor, where he previously worked, \"may have been personal difficulties with management but nothing from a clinical point of view,\" said Dr Thomas. But although these matters are not under direct scrutiny, they will be considered as part of the broad picture once the inquiries have reported.

The trust could terminate his contract and the college could remove him from his fellowship which would prevent him working as a surgeon in the NHS.

After a dramatic fall in attendance figures, organisers of the dome at Greenwich, south-east London, are to ask the culture secretary Chris Smith for a loan of up to \u00a360m in lottery money to cover their losses. Takings at the dome, which is said to attract barely 5,000 visitors a day, are so low that the organisers are barely able to cover their running costs. The dome needs 20,000 visitors a day to break even. The New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the dome, said last night that it had not submitted a formal application for extra funding. But it is understood that a rescue package will be on the table when the Millennium Commission meets in London today under the chairmanship of the culture secretary. The dome desperately needs an injection of cash because the few visitors who do travel to Greenwich are not buying their tickets far in advance. Instead, they are buying them at lottery outlets a few days before visiting the dome, depriving the organisers of much-needed cash. Speculation about a rescue package was fuelled when Lord Falconer, the minister in charge of the dome, conceded at the weekend that a loan might be needed. Lord Falconer knows that he must do all in his power to protect the dome if Labour is to avoid a huge embarrassment. Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, yesterday accused ministers of refusing to answer his questions about the dome's finances. Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has made it clear that he will not bail out the project with taxpayers' money.",

The government has fought against the levying of a 17.5% VAT charge being imposed by the European commission, but the European court of justice's advocate general has now said no country should be exempt from charging a tax on tolls. Siegbert Alber, one of the court's eight advocates-general, said Britain is in breach of a 1977 directive requiring member states to charge the 17.5% tax. A final ruling will be made this summer but it is unlikely motorists using the likes of the Skye bridge and the Dartford tunnel, will escape the charges. Legal experts said last night that in 80% of cases a final decision follows the court advocates opinion. The revelation sparked anger from motoring groups. Paul Watters, head of road and transport policy at the AA, said: \"This is a further imposition on motorists who pay enough tax as it is.\" A department of transport spokesman said: \"These bridges and tunnels provide a public service and the UK government felt VAT should not be levied on the tolls.\" Tory shadow transport secretary Bernard Jenkin said: \"The government have been shirking on this issue. The court's judgment was inevitable.\" The court also said Britain owes millions for late payment of the tax as well as the costs of the long-running case, brought by the European commission. Member states are bound by treaty to pay a proportion of their VAT revenue to the EU's central budget. France is also expected to be badly hitby the ruling.

Although the European Commission has promised more than \u00a33bn for West Wales and the valleys, South Yorkshire, Cornwall and Merseyside, fears are growing that much of the aid will not come unless the government follows Brussels protocol by pledging a similar amount for the six year programmes. So far, there is no indication if -or how - the government plans to provide the additional \u00a33bn. The aim is to pull the regions, among the poorest in western Europe, up the EU wealth league with a range of industrial support, business creation and regeneration schemes. Areas with the \"objective one\" label qualify because GDP per head is at least 25% below the European average. Over the past few weeks, ministers have been criticised by Labour MPs and councillors in theold industrial heartlands who fear that tens of millions of pounds will have to be handed back to Brussels. Opposition members of the Welsh assembly are also threatening to bring down Alun Michael's minority administration in Cardiff over the issue. After a meeting in Cardiff, Liberal Democrats from the four areas have written to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, demanding an unqualified guarantee that matching funds will be available. They warn in a letter that while the European Commission requires additional public funds to match the European grants pound for pound, there is a shortfall from the government \"which means that millions of pounds of EU funds are at risk.\" The issue has now forced itself onto the agenda of the forthcoming Ceredigion byelection, where a Welsh language newspaper has put up a candidate under the \"match funding now\" banner. Opposition parties in Cardiff have said they will table a no confidence motion in Mr Michael next month unless they are satisfied that the treasury is prepared to find matching funding to trigger off a \u00a31.2m package from Europe.

Clearly attempting to cement his legacy, and Al Gore's presidential bid, his speech promised a wide-ranging package of tax cuts, health benefits and education reforms. Touching on everything from school shootings to America's role in the world, Mr Clinton's central domestic thrust was to propose a $350bn (\u00a3219bn) tax-cutting package, the main aim of which was to wrong-foot Republican presidential hopefuls and congressional leaders on their favourite campaign issue. With the crucial New Hampshire primary election only days away, Mr Clinton proposed tax breaks for retirement savings and for the spiralling cost of higher education tuition, central policy themes in the Gore campaign. On these and other big issues such as health insurance and international affairs, Mr Clinton repeatedly threw down an election year gauntlet to the Republicans, whose continuing control of both houses of congress means that few of last night's proposals are likely to reach the statute book. In the wake of last year's US-China agreement on Chinese entry into the World Trade Organisation, the president was expected to urge congress to give China permanent most-favoured-nation trading status during the new legislative session, a goal unlikely to be fulfilled in an election year in which China has emerged as a key foreign policy issue. Mr Clinton's speech underlined his consuming aspiration to be remembered more as a progressive \"third-way\" visionary than as the only elected US president to face an impeachment trial. He invoked Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt and called on America to remake itself once more as \"a new nation\" while staying true to its revolutionary origins.

When Mr Clinton took office in January 1993, the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 3,242; today it is above 11,000. The US unemployment rate was 7.3%; today it is at 4.1%, a 30-year low.

He has written three letters to relatives and friends since then in which he has described the pressure he has been under since the disappearance last November of his second wife, Sharon, 28. In one he admitted he was finding it difficult to cope. Detective Chief Inspector Lewis Benjamin, who is leading the investigation, stressed yesterday that his overriding concern was the safe return of the boys.

The minister said developers had to address reality, rather than build speculatively. \"Seventy per cent of future housing requirement is going to be for one person households and yet the vast majority of the houses we have built over the last 30 years or so have been three bedroom.\" His main grouse is that developers have failed to learn lessons from the past. \"If the density standards that currently apply had been used in the 18th century none of Georgian London would have been developed... some of the most popular (London) homes were built at four to eight times the number of homes that would typically be built on the same space today,\" he said. The Council for the Protection of Rural England has calculated that rebuilding London at the density of current housing would mean filling the entire area within the M25 - 1,000 square miles in all. It says that around England 8m people could be housed on urban derelict land if it was developed as traditional London streets and squares. Significantly, the government's urban task force, chaired by the architect Lord Rogers of Riverside, yesterday entered the debate with another strong attack on speculative house building, particularly in the south-east.",

      "bodyText": "The number of people who contracted HIV through heterosexual sex was higher than those infected through homosexual activity for the first time last year. Figures released by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) have revealed that new diagnoses of the Aids virus in 1999 were the highest for a decade. Of 2,457 people diagnosed with HIV last year, 1,070 were infected through heterosexual sex and 989 through homosexual sex. The remainder were mainly infected as a result of injecting drugs and sharing needles. The 1999 figures are not yet complete and the toll is expected to be the highest in 10 years. Angus Nicoll, head of the service's HIV and sexually transmitted diseases division, said: \"Much of this increase is the result of initiatives to encourage people to get tested, such as the government's new policy of offering universal ante-natal screening to women. \"The majority of those heterosexually-acquired infections affect people who are from or who have spent time in countries with a high prevalence of HIV, in particular, sub-Saharan Africa.\" Dr Nicoll called for better access to prevention and treatment information for ethnic minority groups, particularly those from sub-Saharan Africa. Around 30,000 people are living with HIV in the UK, of whom a third do not know they have the virus. Last year 361 died in the UK as a result of Aids, compared with 357 the previous year. Among heterosexuals with HIV, around half are estimated to be unaware of their condition A spokesman for the Health Education Authority said: \"The most recent research we have done among the heterosexual community shows that people sometimes do not appreciate that there is a very real risk of HIV transmission. \"These figures show that there is a very real risk and that there is a need to practise safe sex and to use a condom.\" The steady decline in deaths among people with HIV and Aids is also levelling off, causing experts more alarm. New combination drug therapies introduced in the mid-90s helped improve survival rates and reduce death rates to a third of what they were before 1995. But there is concern that the tough regime of the drug therapies and their unpleasant side effects are making it difficult for people to take them. And scientists are also worried that HIV sufferers may be developing resistance to the drugs. Dr Nicoll said: \"We are not yet entirely sure what this levelling out indicates. \"It may be that many of these deaths occur in people who are only diagnosed at the time they become sick with Aids, when it can be too late for them to benefit from the new drug therapies. \"Alternatively it may represent cases in which the drugs are not effective, perhaps because of the development of resistance. Further work is needed to explain this trend.\" A spokesman for the National Aids Trust said: \"These infection figures are extremely worrying. We are concerned that the UK is losing its way in HIV prevention and more needs to be done to increase awareness.\" He added: \"The drug therapies are extremely tough regimes which many people find difficult to stick to, and often have very unpleasant side effects. \"We have to give people who are taking these therapies a lot more support, and also look at new, more effective and less unpleasant treatments.\"",

Cut and bruised but alive, the husband fought with Lee in the bedroom and struggled with him down into the front garden, where Lee fled.</p> <p>Detectives were not convinced it was a burglar who had attacked Mr Jones, and within days Sandra Jones had confessed, the court was told.</p> <p>Lee denied conspiring to murder but was found guilty at the end of a two-week trial. After the verdict the court was told he had been convicted of murder in 1981 and served 17 years. Sentencing him, Judge Justice Kay said he was wicked and dangerous. \"You savagely attacked Clifford Jones. It is only fortunate that he lived. I have no doubt your only motive was money.\"</p> <p>Jones, 38, who claimed her husband was violent, pleaded guilty to the same charge, and was jailed for three years. \"Whatever the problems you had, nothing can have justified the action you took. I accept you were deeply unhappy,\" the judge told her.</p> <p>Harvey, 34, of Uttoxeter, was jailed for 18 months after admitting conspiracy. The judge said she was \"totally misguided\" to encourage her friend to hire a hitman.</p> <p>Mr Justice Kay said the women seemed to be in a \"fantasy world\" and described the plot as \"astonishing\". The pair, former schoolfriends, hatched the plot after bumping into each other while shopping. Jones said she was extremely unhappy and claimed her husband was violent, the court heard. She stood to gain \u00a396,000 in life insurance if her husband died, but police did not believe money was her primary motive.</p> <p>One attempt by Jones and Harvey to find someone to \"do Cliff over\" came to nothing, but they persisted and approached Lee, a cleaner in a Uttoxeter pub, knowing he had been convicted of murder and had settled in the town to start a new life.

      "bodyText": "A man who took on a contract killing and bungled it was jailed for life yesterday at Stafford crown court. Matthew Lee, 53, agreed on a price of \u00a35,500 to murder Clifford Jones, 35, when approached by Mr Jones's wife, Sandra, 38, and her best friend, Julie Harvey, 34. The women, old school friends described by the judge as living in a fantasy world, decided on the plot after bumping into each other while shopping, the court had heard. It failed when Lee, who had been given a key, sneaked into the semi in Uttoxeter where Mr Jones was asleep in bed and hit him over the head with a crowbar - but failed to kill him. Cut and bruised but alive, the husband fought with Lee in the bedroom and struggled with him down into the front garden, where Lee fled. Detectives were not convinced it was a burglar who had attacked Mr Jones, and within days Sandra Jones had confessed, the court was told. Lee denied conspiring to murder but was found guilty at the end of a two-week trial. After the verdict the court was told he had been convicted of murder in 1981 and served 17 years. Sentencing him, Judge Justice Kay said he was wicked and dangerous. \"You savagely attacked Clifford Jones. It is only fortunate that he lived. I have no doubt your only motive was money.\" Jones, 38, who claimed her husband was violent, pleaded guilty to the same charge, and was jailed for three years. \"Whatever the problems you had, nothing can have justified the action you took. I accept you were deeply unhappy,\" the judge told her. Harvey, 34, of Uttoxeter, was jailed for 18 months after admitting conspiracy. The judge said she was \"totally misguided\" to encourage her friend to hire a hitman. Mr Justice Kay said the women seemed to be in a \"fantasy world\" and described the plot as \"astonishing\". The pair, former schoolfriends, hatched the plot after bumping into each other while shopping. Jones said she was extremely unhappy and claimed her husband was violent, the court heard. She stood to gain \u00a396,000 in life insurance if her husband died, but police did not believe money was her primary motive. One attempt by Jones and Harvey to find someone to \"do Cliff over\" came to nothing, but they persisted and approached Lee, a cleaner in a Uttoxeter pub, knowing he had been convicted of murder and had settled in the town to start a new life. At first he thought they were joking but eventually agreed when Jones took out a \u00a36,000 loan to pay him. Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting, said: \"The trio decided they would make the murder look like a burglary. Mr Lee was given a key and they carefully hatched a plan which involved him entering the house after Sandra Jones left in the morning.

Within days they discovered Jones had been plotting with Lee. DCI Peter Hall said: \"Sandra was arrested in front of Clifford in the kitchen.

Forced to run the same bankable old reliables, they risked alienating the young and forcing the next generation of writers to look to television and film.</p> <p>Too much emphasis on balancing budgets was affecting the quality of new work, it warned. \"There is also the complex question of the artistic cost of a trading surplus. It seems reasonable that if the funding exists to support quality work then the idea of an 'artistic' deficit is as unacceptable as a trading loss.\"</p> <p>The lottery millions had been a mixed blessing, \"de-stabilising the trading environment\" by favouring the bigger city theatres over those in smaller towns, while the increased costs of running new buildings put a further strain on already straitened budgets.</p> <p>Theatres were also being asked to do educational work and projects to counter social exclusion, without sufficient cash. The report praised regional houses for the work they already do in these areas and said \"the cost of failing to build on the excellence of much current practice is potentially high\".</p> <p>\"Many theatres lack the resources they need to fulfil their potential and deliver this full range of benefits,\" it adds. \"Some of them have become fragile vessels in which to place such wide-ranging responsibilities.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, the report detects positive signs in Whitehall and Chris Smith's victory in wresting more money from the treasury for the arts last year - the first increase in 20 years - \"holds out the prospect of change\".</p> <p>The findings were widely welcomed by regional theatres. Maggie Saxon, of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which - despite huge West End success with Spend, Spend, Spend and big audiences in Leeds - is in the red, said theatres had been set up to fail. \"The case for more money is irrefutable at this stage. The report is an accurate appraisal of the current situation - it is just foolhardy not to invest in these theatres.\"</p> <p>Ludo Keston of the New Victoria in Newcastle under Lyme near Stoke, which is also running a deficit, said the report could not have been clearer that the fundamental issue was lack of money. \"It is up to the government now. Theatre has got to a crunch point. This cannot go on any longer.\"</p> <p>Even theatres which are cited by the government as paragons of virtue, such as the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, which is to launch two shows into the West End in the next few months, argue that extra funding can be put off no longer. Artistic director Simon Stokes said regional theatre was full of \"scavengers who had learned to survive on next to nothing. I challenge anyone to find more financially savvy people anywhere.\"</p> <p>But there were limits to scrimping. \"There is no room for emotion in the subsidised sector, and there never will be. We budget down to zero. We give very, very good value for money. The jury is now out on the government.\"</p> <p>Ted Craig of the Croydon Warehouse, whose very existence is threatened by property developers, said it all boiled down to more money. \"We never have seen any realistic increases in funding.

The Arts Council-commissioned Boyden report - which is likely to form the basis of the most radical shake-up in decades - blames theatres' woes not on waste or mismanagement but on being continually starved of cash. The findings are a clear challenge to government thinking that further sacrifices will have to be made and more theatres closed before the long-running policy of \"misery for all\" can be ended. When the review was first announced last year, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, called for \"unsentimental hard decisions\" and warned that \"simply because funding support has always been in place [it should not be assumed] that it must continue to be the case for ever more\". But management consultants Peter Boyden and Associates, who found that more than half the \"producing\" theatres they surveyed were in the red, said a failure to take risks for fear of further losses was cramping creativity. Their preliminary report claims that without help, loss-making theatres which clung on through the Thatcher years \"have little chance of trading their way out of trouble. The debilitating artistic impact of fragile balance sheets is a major constraint for producing theatres,\" it added. \"Boards feel exposed to personal liability, programmes tended to conservative and innovation discouraged.\" Crucially, it confirms long-held fears within the industry that over-reliance on populist playwrights like John Gobder and Alan Ayckbourn is turning some regional reps into \"museums\". Forced to run the same bankable old reliables, they risked alienating the young and forcing the next generation of writers to look to television and film. Too much emphasis on balancing budgets was affecting the quality of new work, it warned. \"There is also the complex question of the artistic cost of a trading surplus. It seems reasonable that if the funding exists to support quality work then the idea of an 'artistic' deficit is as unacceptable as a trading loss.\" The lottery millions had been a mixed blessing, \"de-stabilising the trading environment\" by favouring the bigger city theatres over those in smaller towns, while the increased costs of running new buildings put a further strain on already straitened budgets. Theatres were also being asked to do educational work and projects to counter social exclusion, without sufficient cash. The report praised regional houses for the work they already do in these areas and said \"the cost of failing to build on the excellence of much current practice is potentially high\". \"Many theatres lack the resources they need to fulfil their potential and deliver this full range of benefits,\" it adds. \"Some of them have become fragile vessels in which to place such wide-ranging responsibilities.\" Nevertheless, the report detects positive signs in Whitehall and Chris Smith's victory in wresting more money from the treasury for the arts last year - the first increase in 20 years - \"holds out the prospect of change\". The findings were widely welcomed by regional theatres. Maggie Saxon, of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which - despite huge West End success with Spend, Spend, Spend and big audiences in Leeds - is in the red, said theatres had been set up to fail. \"The case for more money is irrefutable at this stage. The report is an accurate appraisal of the current situation - it is just foolhardy not to invest in these theatres.\" Ludo Keston of the New Victoria in Newcastle under Lyme near Stoke, which is also running a deficit, said the report could not have been clearer that the fundamental issue was lack of money. \"It is up to the government now. Theatre has got to a crunch point. This cannot go on any longer.\" Even theatres which are cited by the government as paragons of virtue, such as the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, which is to launch two shows into the West End in the next few months, argue that extra funding can be put off no longer. Artistic director Simon Stokes said regional theatre was full of \"scavengers who had learned to survive on next to nothing. I challenge anyone to find more financially savvy people anywhere.\" But there were limits to scrimping. \"There is no room for emotion in the subsidised sector, and there never will be. We budget down to zero. We give very, very good value for money. The jury is now out on the government.\" Ted Craig of the Croydon Warehouse, whose very existence is threatened by property developers, said it all boiled down to more money. \"We never have seen any realistic increases in funding. Over 20 years this builds up. It's a now or never situation, I'm afraid.\" Behind the scenes: the fight for survival Croydon Warehouse (Breaking even) Artistic director Ted Craig: 'We're on the edge. Since our lottery application to build a new theatre was turned down, we could be closed down at any time by the property developer who owns the area. We will keep hammering on.' Despite their troubles, 'people are being turned away' from the theatre's second Dick Barton-based hit, The Pharaoh's Tomb, which will soon go on national tour West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds (In debt) Chief executive Maggie Saxon: 'You have to be stubborn and stand up to people who want to put you in a box.' A regional powerhouse, the Playhouse scored huge West End success with Spend, Spend, Spend, its musical based on pools winner Viv Nicholson. Also hopes to transfer its current hit, Singing in the Rain, to London Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich (Closed) The last proper rep in East Anglia went dark last year. A strong local campaign has been launched to resurrect it Theatre Royal, Plymouth (Not in debt) Artistic director Simon Stokes: 'We've pioneered a way of surviving with co- productions that others are following.' Lautrec, a musical based on the French painter, opens soon and will transfer to the West End. Adventures in Motion Pictures will open its follow-up to Swan Lake there in March New Victoria Theatre, Stoke (In debt) Manager Ludo Keston: 'There's a danger we'll all turn into museums. We want to be able to put on the best of now not the best of what was.' Mr Keston has reduced debts from \u00a3200,000 to \u00a360,000 The Gate, Notting Hill (In debt) Artistic director Mick Gordon: 'This is a passion machine. We need \u00a330,000 by March. It's mad and it's always the same every year. The whole situation is crazy.' Mr Gordon earns \u00a37,000 for running a fringe theatre with an international reputation Palace Theatre, Watford (Not in debt) Artistic director Lawrence Till:'You have no idea what has been lost because of lack of money. It doesn't bear thinking.' The Palace produced the West End hit Elton John's Glasses. The Late Middle Classes, which it commissioned, was voted play of the year last year",

Mr Quinn said: \"When I entered the room Daniel was sitting on the floor but with his back in a position against the wall.\" Daniel never regained consciousness, the court heard. Detective Sergeant Eric Malcolm confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances. He added that after two searches of the room no suicide note had been found.",

      "bodyText": "A British man shot dead by Spanish police in the holiday resort of Torremolinos yesterday was wanted in connection with a series of sexual assaults on an 11-year-old girl, Spanish authorities said. The man, identified by Spanish police as Michael Lindgen-Hornett, 49, was killed after a car chase from Malaga airport, where British police officers had gone to try to arrest him. British authorities last night refused to confirm his identity. A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that two officers from the Metropolitan police had flown to Spain to arrest a man in connection with indecency charges. Spanish police said that Mr Lindgen-Hornett had driven his British-registered car on the wrong side of the road for almost 20 miles as he tried to escape police. After crashing in a dead end street he is then said to have attempted to reverse his car over a Spanish police officer. Spanish police opened fire and shot him once in the chest. A foreign office spokesman said: \"We believe that a man shot and killed by Spanish police in Torremolinos on January 27 may have been a British national.\" A Scotland Yard spokesman said the two Met officers had travelled to Spain on Wednesday after a man failed to answer to police bail. \"They travelled to Spain in connection with the proposed arrest of a man wanted for questioning by the Met in relation to alleged indecency offences,\" he said. The spokesman added: \"I cannot confirm the whereabouts of the Met officers at the time of the shooting, but it is a Spanish police matter.\" He added that the man they were looking to interview was arrested in Britain last year and released on police bail in November.",

It is as easy to imagine the BBC's veteran biographer sweet-talking girlfriends, wives and children down the years as he has so successfully done with politicians. He's done it again, this time with Tony Blair (What Makes Tony Tick?, BBC2, Sunday, 8pm). </p> <p>For over 10 years now, the bedrock of the Cockerell family mortgage in Notting Hill has been television political portraits, all the way from Enoch Powell and Alan Clark on the Tory right through to lefties like Barbara Castle and Michael Foot. </p> <p>There have been plenty of centrists in between, the Callaghans, Healeys and Ken Clarkes. In fact, Clarke was a first: perceptively profiled while still chancellor. His little brother, a cheerful Midlands car salesman, said Ken had never acknowledged their mother's alcoholism. The poignant interview with Clarke seemed to bear out that claim. </p> <p>But on Sunday night Cockerell tackles the centrist's centrist: Blair gives what his interrogator calls the most intimate and frank answers to personal questions ever provided by an incumbent prime minister. </p> <p>\"People will see him in a way they have never seen him before,\" predicts Cockerell. It is enough to persuade Tunbridge Wells colonels to stay by the telly with their shotguns. There are shirt-sleeved Blair opinions on the death of Princess Diana, on charges that he is a control freak or the Napoleon of Downing St - a claim first made by an aide who meant it as a moderniser's compliment. As with several of Cockerell's recent films - How To Be A Foreign Secretary or Westminster's Secret Service - this is as much the portrait of an institution as an individual. </p> <p>Cockerell, a manipulative expert at pre-publicity, was cagey for this article. He dribbles out titbits around Fleet St before transmission day and knows that tomorrow's tabloids will love what he has learned about Di, and about Blair and Cherie's courtship (and recent baby). </p> <p>We usually forgive Cockerell his tricks because he delivers what he promises, Roy Jenkins's love life, for instance. Tastefully done, natch. Alan Clark's slightly less tastefully. While the TV crew was waiting for the diarist to arrive home at Saltwood Castle, his formidable wife, Jane, spilled the beans on camera while feeding the peacocks. </p> <p>Cockerell the telly spin-doctor sees this as a turning point for the boy premier - that the film will do for him what Martin Bashir's interview did for the doomed princess (\"there were three of us in the marriage\"). But serious students of the Cockerell oeuvre may find their interest focused on that perennially fascinating topic which holds up the government: the Blair-Brown relationship. Throw in \"Bobby\" Mandelson and indeed it is the nearest thing New Labour has to a marital threesome. </p> <p>Everyone knows the story, Cockerell conceded yesterday. How Tony and Gordon were inseparable, how they both assumed Gordon was the senior partner until the dreadful day of John Smith's sudden death in 1994. How Blair, backed by Mandelson, rapidly emerged as the heir and Brown gave up his claim - for now. </p> <p>\"Those few weeks were the most difficult days in my entire life. There was a lot of sorting out to do with Gordon,\" Blair tells Cockerell. But the film, some of it not previously seen, tells the story better. The two young MPs are seen chatting and joking in the 80s and early 90s - the body language is relaxed and intimate. Cut to the Blair-Brown meeting last week to back Frank Dobson's bid for London mayor. Blair praises his chancellor with evident admiration. But Mr Brown is seen scarcely to smile, let alone laugh at his friend's jokes. </p> <p>Lord Irvine, Blair's legal pupil master, now his Lord Chancellor, is seen to say: \"Tony was the right man at the right time in the right place and luck plays a crucial part in the career of every politician.\" Blair stresses how close they remain, but it is a different relationship, one with a big unresolved question at its heart. </p> <p>Labour's former general secretary, now chairman of the Notting Hill Housing Trust, Lord Tom Sawyer, gives viewers a flavour of it all. </p> <p>\"I think obviously there's lots of public comment about his relationship with Gordon. I observed them both closely at many, many meetings between '94 and '98, and I would say it was a very strong professional relationship,\" he reports. \"But you must never underestimate the tensions at the top in politics. Doors do slam, telephones do get slammed down, and people drift for a few days and don't speak. But this happens in families, never mind in politics.\" </p> <p>Doors slammed, sulks and silences, it is the stuff of cabinet government since the cabinet itself first evolved in that jerry-built terraced house in the 18th century.

I have an honest face. </p> <p>This Columbus was an Italian anatomist, who spotted the clitoris in the course of a day's routine rummaging. As Donne put it \"Oh my America! my new-found-land.\" </p> <p>Channel 4 are not familiar with the meaning of the word private, which is why the lift running up the side of their offices is made of glass and why they are showing a series called <strong> Private Parts </strong> . You have to behave very circumspectly in the lift. This is not true of the series. </p> <p>Next week, the penis. This week the clitoris. An hour is a long time in television, but I must say it grew on me. In every sense, I suppose. </p> <p>The catch about being a critic is that, while television puts out such programmes at night, the review is read in the morning. Parts of the film were plainly pornographic in a perfectly well intentioned way. A faithful account would tend to put you off your Cheerios. </p> <p>Those who persevered to the end encountered an endearing duo, Del and Svar, artists who specialise in genitalia. Rather like Steve, who makes plaster casts of the vulva for drawer handles. You put your hand in and pull, if you follow me. Del and Svar were women, but decided against it.

      "bodyText": "Columbus discovered the clitoris in the sixteenth century. Trust me. I have an honest face. This Columbus was an Italian anatomist, who spotted the clitoris in the course of a day's routine rummaging. As Donne put it \"Oh my America! my new-found-land.\" Channel 4 are not familiar with the meaning of the word private, which is why the lift running up the side of their offices is made of glass and why they are showing a series called Private Parts . You have to behave very circumspectly in the lift. This is not true of the series. Next week, the penis. This week the clitoris. An hour is a long time in television, but I must say it grew on me. In every sense, I suppose. The catch about being a critic is that, while television puts out such programmes at night, the review is read in the morning. Parts of the film were plainly pornographic in a perfectly well intentioned way. A faithful account would tend to put you off your Cheerios. Those who persevered to the end encountered an endearing duo, Del and Svar, artists who specialise in genitalia. Rather like Steve, who makes plaster casts of the vulva for drawer handles. You put your hand in and pull, if you follow me. Del and Svar were women, but decided against it. By dint of determined doses of male hormones, they achieved something between a clitoris and a penis. There was clearly room for improvement, so Del demonstrated a sort of vacuum pump. The result can be unpredictable. \"Oh! No!

Referring to the prime minister as \"his nibs\", Mr Dobson said in an interview with the New Statesman magazine that he had suffered \"more harm than anybody else\" and lost considerable support as a result of the leadership's intervention on his behalf. But as ballot papers for the Labour nomination are delivered to almost 50,000 party members in the capital, the prime minister once more endorsed him in a final push before voting begins. \"He is someone I can trust,\" Mr Blair said, adding: \"You take him as he is.\" The final stages of the nomination battle were again marked with bitter accusations and controversy.

Mr Dobson said: \"He will have alienated a lot of Afro-Carribean Labour supporters\", adding that \"people will not be very happy at this casual opportunism by Ken\".

      "bodyText": "The government moved to appease opponents of its plan to repeal section 28 yesterday, by promising to place marriage and family life at the heart of strengthened sex education guidelines. Though mainstream gay campaigners were unwilling to condemn the move publicly, privately critics fear it would amount to a reintroduction of section 28 through the back door. A commitment by the socially conservative education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, to issue new guidance follows pressure from religious leaders protesting at the planned change to the law banning the \"promotion\" of homosexuality. In a phrase which will infuriate gay campaigners, department for education sources yesterday indicated that the advice on sex and relationships education would effectively give guidance \"along the same lines\" as section 28. Although the department yesterday stressed there was \"no intention for the new guidance to be a vehicle for the deliberate promotion of any sexual orientation\", it also said the circular would cover \"the importance and nature of marriage and family life in bringing up children\". Mr Blunkett told the cabinet yesterday: \"What people do not want is proselytising\" in favour of gay lifestyles. He promised to talk to church leaders. Tony Blair argued that repeal is vital because section 28 is a \"badly drafted, discriminatory piece of legislation\". The commitment to consult widely on the guidelines is a clear attempt by ministers to defuse the row over section 28, amid attacks on the repeal plans by high profile bishops and, on Wednesday, by the chief rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks. The move has also been criticised by the right-wing media. However, the government has also made - somewhat clumsy - attempts to keep its own backbenchers on board, finally issuing a firm commitment yesterday that Labour MPs would be ordered to vote in favour of repeal of the clause, introduced under the 1988 local government act. Backbenchers had earlier expressed outrage at Downing Street suggestions that MPs - a handful of whom are opposed to the change - could be given a free vote on the issue. The planned new guidance for schools will relate to sex and relationships education, taught as part of personal, social and health education. The guidelines, last issued in 1994, are due to be updated following recommendations in a government report on teenage pregnancies before Christmas. Mr Blunkett, a supporter of the traditional family who opposes the reduction of the gay age of consent to 16, also wants to bring the guidance in line with the priorities underpinning new citizenship lessons, which will also stress the importance of marriage and stable families. The sex education guidelines will also remind schools that policy should be decided by the governing body, in consultation with parents. Downing Street hopes that, too, will reassure opponents of section 28 repeal. A DfEE source said: \"The guidance will be strong in guiding schools and authorities.

The lesbian and gay pressure group Stonewall, while accepting the current guidelines' support for stable families and marriage, last night said it sought further measures enabling teachers to address homophobic discrimination.",

It would be more than 25 years before another man, the Australian Rod Laver, equalled that feat, and in the 60-odd years since Budge's triumph, no other American male player has managed it.</p> <p>In that year Budge had surpassed himself. He not only won the men's doubles, mixed doubles and singles at Wimbledon - all for the second year running - but also became the first player ever to win Wimbledon without the loss of a set. In the final, against Britain's Bunny Austin, he lost only four games. \"Donald was unstoppable that afternoon, almost unplayable at times,\" Austin remembered. \"He was a true great. It was an honour just to be on the same court.\" Budge won 6-1, 6-0, 6-3.</p> <p>Beating John Bromwich in the 1938 Australian final, Roderick Menzel in the French, and his own doubles partner Gene Mako in the US, Budge confirmed his position as an American sporting legend. He was also heroic in refusing to play in Germany that year, in protest at the Nazis' imprisonment of his old opponent Baron Gottfried von Cramm.</p> <p>Budge's father, a printer, had played football for Glasgow Rangers but moved his family to California, where Budge was born in Oakland. He attended University High School and the University of California at Berkeley, dropping out in 1935 when offered the chance to play in the US Davis Cup team heading for England.</p> <p>As a child, he was keener on basketball and football, and played no tennis between the ages of 11 and 15. Nor did he look a potential champion. Painfully thin, red-headed, with a prominent nose, protruding ears and eyes close together, he appeared more pasty-faced Glaswegian than Californian golden boy. But, in the summer of 1930, he was persuaded to enter the state boys' tennis championships, and won the final 6-0, 6-4.</p> <p>In 1932, he won the Pacific Coast junior crown and, in 1933, the California state junior and senior championships - he was the first player for years to win both titles in the same season - as well as the Del Monte, Oakland and San Jose senior tournaments.</p> <p>On his first trip east, he beat another talented teenager, Gene Mako, who became his long-term double s partner and friend, in the process helping the gawky, six-foot Budge to overcome a near-debilitating shyness. In 1934, he retained his California state championship and, with Mako, won the Pacific Coast. On his way east he beat Frank Parker in the semi-finals of the national clay court championship in Chicago, at a time when Parker was thought invincible on clay.</p> <p>Representing the US four times (1935-38) in international team competition for the Davis Cup, Budge won 25 out of 29 matches, and in 1937 led the US team to its first victory since 1926. He effectively clinched this triumph with what is often described as the greatest match in the history of tennis, the third-day singles match in the interzone finals at Wimbledon against the German champion von Cramm. Budge lost the first two sets and, having equalised, was 2-5 down in the fifth set - but, in a match of transcendent virtuosity, he eventually triumphed 6-8, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6.</p> <p>This match was filmed, so it is still possible to witness Budge's unique talent at its height. His victory, restoring the Davis Cup to the US after its loss to France a decade earlier, was an immediate stimulus to American tennis and inspired thousands to adopt his aggressive style.</p> <p>At this point, Budge had also just become Wimbledon champion. He had reached the semi-finals at his first attempt, unseeded, in 1935, overcoming Bunny Austin in an extraordinarily lengthy quarter-finals match, before losing to von Cramm. The following year, seeded fifth, he did equally well, losing to Fred Perry, while becoming, with Mako, US doubles champion.</p> <p>In the 1937 Wimbledon clash, Budge lost only one set, and beat von Cramm 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in the finals. With Mako, he also won the men's doubles and, with Alice Marble, the mixed doubles. He was also that year's US champion, and for the third year running won the Mercedes Benz Cup. At the New York World's Fair, Babe Ruth presented him with the Sullivan Award as outstanding national athlete in any sport, the first time a tennis player had won this trophy.</p> <p>Budge's style was innovatively aggressive, with good weight of shot all round. His backhand, even stronger than his forehand, made devastating use of a heavy, 15-ounce racquet, and he developed a rolled shot that was consistently accurate and awesomely authoritative. He said that Ellsworth Vines was \"the best player in the world on his day\", while watching Fred Perry taught him the importance of commanding the net. \"I patterned my game after Vines and Perry; then I turned it up a notch\" he said. He never smoked, nor drank during his years as a player. Asked what made a champion, he replied: \"Discipline. You have to have discipline to go to bed early.\"</p> <p>The power of his strokes and his determination to win were combined with an unshakably sportsmanlike demeanour. As Laurie Pignon put it, \"he never questioned a call or raised a ginger eyebrow.\"</p> <p>Between 1933 and 1938, Budge had survived in the amateur game on tournament expense money. He always denied having been paid under the table, though he conceded that \"expenses\" could be generous. When the Australian Tennis Association paid for him and Mako to sail to Australia, for instance, the journey took three weeks each way. On the other hand, his Wimbledon prize was a Mappin &amp; Webb voucher for \u00a35.</p> <p>It couldn't go on, and after his grand slam win, Budge announced that he would turn pro at the beginning of 1939. He had turned down an offer of $50,000 the previous year; now he accepted it.</p> <p>Some 16,000 people turned out to Madison Square Garden for Budge's pro debut against his old idol, Ellsworth Vines, on the night of January 3 1939. He won. In March, he beat Fred Perry. In his first year as a pro, he recalled in the 1980s, he \"made $148,000 and paid $2,080 in taxes.

      "body": "<p>A powerful bomb blast yesterday ripped through the main post office in the northern Sri Lankan town of Vavuniya, killing at least 10 people, including three soldiers.</p> <p>The bomb, which was left on a counter inside the building, appeared to be aimed at security personnel, who made regular visits there.</p> <p>\"It was payday on Wednesday, and everyone knows that the next day the army and police go to the post office to send money orders back to their families in the south,\" said P Manikavasagam, a local journalist.</p> <p>The late-morning explosion injured more than 70 people, mostly civilians, with eight soldiers and eight policemen among the casualties.</p> <p>\"It seems that those responsible were targeting the army, but unfortunately the public was also killed,\" the army spokesman Brigadier Palitha Fernando said.</p> <p>The security forces have blamed the attack on the rebel Tamil Tigers who have been fighting a 17-year battle for a separate Tamil homeland in the country's north and east.</p> <p>The separatists attacked police and army convoys, killing nine soldiers in a mine attack just south of Vavuniya two weeks ago. A Tamil town controlled by the government, Vavuniya is an obvious target, as it lies less than 13 miles from the front lines.</p> <p>The Tigers have also been blamed for three recent suicide bombings in which more than 50 people have died. The Sri Lankan president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, sustained serious eye injuries during one attack on her final election rally in Colombo in December, and earlier this month another suicide bomber blew herself up outside the office of Ms Kumaratunga's mother, the prime minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike.</p> <p>In October the Tigers overran several army camps just north of Vavuniya, and there were fears that the town would be attacked.</p> <p>At one point, the Tigers ordered everyone to leave and residents, expecting artillery attacks, fled to nearby villages and towns until the Tigers relaxed the order.</p> <p>The government has stepped up its efforts to track down the Tigers. The police and army have carried out cordon and search operations in Tamil areas of Colombo, where thousands of people have been photographed and questioned. Hooded informants have been used to point out suspects.</p> <p>The blast followed a visit this week by a high-level delegation from Norway, which raised speculation about peace moves. The Norwegian secretary for development, co-operation and human rights, Leiv Lunde, met representatives of the Tamil parties, ministers and civil groups.</p> <p>Norwegian officials and a Tamil Tiger representative are also reported to have met in London.

      "bodyText": "A powerful bomb blast yesterday ripped through the main post office in the northern Sri Lankan town of Vavuniya, killing at least 10 people, including three soldiers. The bomb, which was left on a counter inside the building, appeared to be aimed at security personnel, who made regular visits there. \"It was payday on Wednesday, and everyone knows that the next day the army and police go to the post office to send money orders back to their families in the south,\" said P Manikavasagam, a local journalist. The late-morning explosion injured more than 70 people, mostly civilians, with eight soldiers and eight policemen among the casualties. \"It seems that those responsible were targeting the army, but unfortunately the public was also killed,\" the army spokesman Brigadier Palitha Fernando said. The security forces have blamed the attack on the rebel Tamil Tigers who have been fighting a 17-year battle for a separate Tamil homeland in the country's north and east. The separatists attacked police and army convoys, killing nine soldiers in a mine attack just south of Vavuniya two weeks ago. A Tamil town controlled by the government, Vavuniya is an obvious target, as it lies less than 13 miles from the front lines. The Tigers have also been blamed for three recent suicide bombings in which more than 50 people have died. The Sri Lankan president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, sustained serious eye injuries during one attack on her final election rally in Colombo in December, and earlier this month another suicide bomber blew herself up outside the office of Ms Kumaratunga's mother, the prime minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In October the Tigers overran several army camps just north of Vavuniya, and there were fears that the town would be attacked. At one point, the Tigers ordered everyone to leave and residents, expecting artillery attacks, fled to nearby villages and towns until the Tigers relaxed the order. The government has stepped up its efforts to track down the Tigers. The police and army have carried out cordon and search operations in Tamil areas of Colombo, where thousands of people have been photographed and questioned. Hooded informants have been used to point out suspects. The blast followed a visit this week by a high-level delegation from Norway, which raised speculation about peace moves. The Norwegian secretary for development, co-operation and human rights, Leiv Lunde, met representatives of the Tamil parties, ministers and civil groups. Norwegian officials and a Tamil Tiger representative are also reported to have met in London. The government, which previously rejected any idea of a third-party mediator in the conflict, now appears to support it. \"The Norweigans wouldn't say anything because whatever they are doing is very sensitive,\" said R Sampanthan of the Tamil United Liberation Front, who met Mr Lunde. \"But they are very interested in the prospects of peace and the need for a consensus.\" The government has already drawn up a timetable for peace. Ms Kumaratunga's hopes are pinned on a proposal to devolve power to the regions to satisfy Tamil demands for more autonomy. The government says it will negotiate with the Tigers after discussing its proposals with the other political parties. But the bomb blast in Vavuniya suggests the Tigers are not immediately giving up their armed struggle. \"On the surface, there is some positive movement and we should support that,\" said Jehan Perera of the National Peace Council. \"But the fact that the Tigers blasted this bomb probably gives out a message as well.\" General elections are due within the next seven months, and political parties are likely to wait until afterwards before committing themselves to peace plans which may end in failure.",

      "bodyText": "Thirty-five years after the Moroccan opposition leader Mehdi Ben Barka disappeared after being kidnapped in Paris, his secret burial site has been located south of the capital. His body was buried under Europe's biggest mosque, built by his bitter foe, the late King Hassan II of Morocco. The operation to silence Ben Barka, the king's former mathematics teacher who died aged 45, involved the Moroccan defence chief, General Mohammed Oufkir, the French secret service and leading gangland figures linked to the Gaullist party. The discovery of his grave follows a decision by King Mohammed VI, enthroned last year after Hassan's death, to allow Ben Barka's widow and four children to return to Morocco. The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has also lifted a secrecy ban on most of the archives documenting the affair. It appears that Hassan had known of the circumstances of Ben Barka's murder when he financed the building of the \u00a360m mosque over the secret grave. The building of the mosque, at Courcouronnes near Orly airport, started in October 1984, 19 years after Ben Barka was bundled into a car as he went to the Lipp brasserie in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s for lunch. He had flown to Paris from Geneva, where he was living in exile, supposedly to discuss a film on oppression in Morocco, where he faced arrest for leading a democracy movement. The invitation was a set-up, according to evidence given in several criminal trials that arose from the kidnapping. After being stopped by two plainclothes French policemen on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, Ben Barka was handed over to Frenchmen with long criminal records at a house at Fontenay-le-Vicomte, south of Paris, to await a meeting with Oufkir. After being seriously injured in a fight with his captors, the opposition leader was bound and gagged, then transferred to a house at nearby Ormoy, where he died in a cellar on October 30 1965. What happened to his body has now been revealed to Paris Match by a former secret serviceman, Antoine Lopez, known as \"Don Pedro\". Mr Lopez, now 75, said he had seen Ben Barka being tortured in the cellar and then helped put his body, wrapped in an army blanket, in the boot of a Mercedes. The car was driven six miles to a field, where his kidnappers dug a grave in a small copse known as the Bois de la Mare \u00e0 la Besace. Oufkir was convicted of Ben Barka's abduction and murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in his absence by a French court. He died in 1972 after leading an abortive coup against King Hassan. A French policeman and an intelligence agent were jailed for the abduction. Several senior French intelligence personnel were sacked but many details of the case remain unclear because their involvement resulted in many documents being classified. It is believed that archives may reveal that France's president at the time of Ben Barka's murder, Charles de Gaulle, knew of the burial site and had informed Hassan before the area was submerged by a building programme for the new town. Three years after Ben Barka's burial, French authorities compulsorily acquired the land and in 1977 ceded it to a Moroccan cultural association. Guided by Mr Lopez, investigators have located the site under the car park in front of the mosque, but have ruled out exhumation because it is under several feet of concrete. According to Paris Match, Mr Lopez, the last surviving member of the kidnap team living in France, traded his information against an eventual meeting with Hassan. The king was invited to the Bastille Day celebrations last year, but died 10 days later, before a meeting could be arranged. Revelations concerning the burial site have not quashed rumours that Ben Barka's head was sent to Hassan in a diplomatic bag and buried in a desert tomb. Nor has there been any progress in finding four gangsters linked to the abduction who were given refuge by Hassan after fleeing France.",

      "bodyText": "In a daring challenge to the Islamic system, female medical students in Iran are refusing to attend classes and are staging sit-ins in protest at their segregation from men in universities. The students believe they receive an inferior medical education to their male peers. One medical school in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom is for women only, and in Tehran's universities men and women must attend classes in separate rooms or sit on opposite sides of the classroom. \"We suffer because we have little interaction with our male classmates. We rarely have an exchange of ideas. There is a wall between us,\" said Homa, 24, a student at Tehran university's medical school. \"Many classes are for women only, and the best professors and facilities go to the men. We get the leftovers,\" she said. This week a group of female medical students called upon President Mohammad Khatami and the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reverse what they believe is sex discrimination. They have also complained to the health ministry. Such action may not guarantee immediate change. But their public dissent adds a significant voice to a growing demand for sexual equality. Even some reformist theologians now say that the clerical establishment has misinterpreted the Islamic texts taken as the basis for Iranian laws. Ayatollah Yusef Sanei, a reformist cleric, ruled two months ago that women were free to run for president of the republic, and to be given more rights in cases of spousal abuse and divorce. There is growing opposition to the inequality between the sexes that continues despite the significant gains women have made since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Today, there are more women than men in higher education, and women are increasingly seen in important positions of authority. Women were encouraged to attend medical school after the revolution so they could treat female patients, in line with conservative readings of Islamic teachings. But these opportunities no longer satisfy women in modern Iran. \"In theory, our government says women are equal. But in practice and in our culture this is not the case,\" said one woman, a 25-year-old medical student, who wished to remain unidentified. \"I know when I begin practising medicine, male doctors will always have more authority over me. It doesn't matter if I am smarter than they are or if I am a better physician.\" One medical professor said sex discrimination had led to her resignation from the women-only Fatimieh medical school in Qom. \"In Islam, male doctors are allowed to treat female patients. So why should the state separate men from women in medical schools?\" she asked. \"When I went to medical school 23 years ago under the shah, men and women studied together and we had no problems. To enter medical school, you have to be at the top of your class, and students are there to learn, not to flirt.\" Parliament passed a law in 1998 to segregate health services to reflect conservative MPs' interpretation of Islam. Under a pilot programme prompted by the legislation, the Fatimieh medical school in Qom, the intellectual centre for the Shi'ite Muslim clergy, dismissed all its male staff. But experts say the quality of medical education has suffered as a result, with women students deprived of the wide range of patients and teachers they need to complete their education. Taha Hashemi, a cleric and MP who sits on the school's board of trustees, told the daily Aftab-e Emrouz he had proposed hiring older male staff to bolster student training. \"I and several other members have stopped attending board meetings in protest of the existing situation,\" he said.",

According to the records, Hemings gave birth to six children, including two who died in infancy.</p> <p>The confirmation of a direct link between one of the country's founding fathers and generations of black claimants to his name symbolically affirms the central role of African-Americans in the making of the modern nation.</p> <p>\"It's about time that someone is validating what oral history has confirmed for years,\" said Shay Banks-Young, a Hemings descendant.</p> <p>Daniel Jordan, the foundation's president said that although the results were not 100% conclusive, \"the evidence is compelling and we think the evidence is persuasive... whether it was love or lust, rape or romance no one knows and it's unlikely that anyone will ever know\".</p> <p>The foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, and maintains the country's most extensive archive on Jefferson, spent almost a decade on its investigation, examining DNA evidence and appraising oral histories, plantation documents and artefacts.</p> <p>A study in the scientific journal Nature in 1998 found DNA links between Jefferson's white family and Hemings's descendants, but sceptics argued that Sally Hemings may have had a relationship with Jefferson's brother, Randolph.</p> <p>The foundation's study, however, looked through Jefferson's journal in which he recorded where he spent each day of his adult life, and found that he was in the same place as Sally Hemings, who was 30 years his junior, each time the six children were conceived.</p> <p>\"How likely is it that this could have occurred by chance if Jefferson was not the father? Not very?\" said Fraser Neiman, Monticello's director of archaeology. He ran the probabilities through four mathematical models and found there was only a 1% chance that Jefferson's presence at the time of each conception was a coincidence.</p> <p>There was no evidence that Jefferson's brother was in Monticello in the relevant periods, but Herbert Barger, who is married to one of Jefferson's descendants, called the report inconclusive and argued: \"Nobody keeps an accurate record every time they invite their brother up for a visit.\" Mr Barger, however, is one of a dwindling number of sceptics.</p> <p>The Monticello Association, a group of Jefferson's acknowledged white descendants, is due to meet in May to discuss the evidence and to consider whether Sally Hemings's descendants should be buried in the family graveyard at Monticello.</p> <p>Lucian Truscott, an association member pressing for the graveyard to be opened, said: \"This is like the civil rights act for the Hemings family.

According to the records, Hemings gave birth to six children, including two who died in infancy. The confirmation of a direct link between one of the country's founding fathers and generations of black claimants to his name symbolically affirms the central role of African-Americans in the making of the modern nation. \"It's about time that someone is validating what oral history has confirmed for years,\" said Shay Banks-Young, a Hemings descendant. Daniel Jordan, the foundation's president said that although the results were not 100% conclusive, \"the evidence is compelling and we think the evidence is persuasive... whether it was love or lust, rape or romance no one knows and it's unlikely that anyone will ever know\". The foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, and maintains the country's most extensive archive on Jefferson, spent almost a decade on its investigation, examining DNA evidence and appraising oral histories, plantation documents and artefacts. A study in the scientific journal Nature in 1998 found DNA links between Jefferson's white family and Hemings's descendants, but sceptics argued that Sally Hemings may have had a relationship with Jefferson's brother, Randolph. The foundation's study, however, looked through Jefferson's journal in which he recorded where he spent each day of his adult life, and found that he was in the same place as Sally Hemings, who was 30 years his junior, each time the six children were conceived. \"How likely is it that this could have occurred by chance if Jefferson was not the father? Not very?\" said Fraser Neiman, Monticello's director of archaeology. He ran the probabilities through four mathematical models and found there was only a 1% chance that Jefferson's presence at the time of each conception was a coincidence. There was no evidence that Jefferson's brother was in Monticello in the relevant periods, but Herbert Barger, who is married to one of Jefferson's descendants, called the report inconclusive and argued: \"Nobody keeps an accurate record every time they invite their brother up for a visit.\" Mr Barger, however, is one of a dwindling number of sceptics. The Monticello Association, a group of Jefferson's acknowledged white descendants, is due to meet in May to discuss the evidence and to consider whether Sally Hemings's descendants should be buried in the family graveyard at Monticello. Lucian Truscott, an association member pressing for the graveyard to be opened, said: \"This is like the civil rights act for the Hemings family. It's what I believe and it's what the Hemings have known for 200 years.\" Useful links: Monticello: The Home of Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson - White House NetNotes on Thomas Jefferson",

The two last such speeches were given at a time when he and the country were preoccupied with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Taking a shot at the Republicans, Clinton said they for too long have been \"standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities\" - such as campaign finance reform. He said America now has the \"confidence to dream big dreams\". \"We will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed - because our chance to do good is so great,\" he said. Senate budget committee chairman Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said Clinton has proposed $225bn in new government spending in the past 31 days and, coupled with a $118bn prescription drug benefit for seniors on Medicare, adds up to $343bn in new government spending. \"If President Clinton speaks tonight for 90 minutes, he will be spending almost $4bn a minute,\" Domenici said. Some of Clinton's agenda was warmed over from last year, including $350bn in tax breaks targeted at the middle class over 10 years. It would be offset by about $100bn in savings from closing corporate tax loopholes, for net tax breaks of $250bn. It was roughly the same as last year and an attempt to answer Republicans who say Americans deserve broad tax cuts because of the surpluses. A big-ticket tax break item was his proposal for retirement savings accounts, first offered last year. It would give an estimated 76m Americans the opportunity to save for their retirement through a progressive tax cut. It would cost $54bn over 10 years. Clinton proposed spending $110bn over 10 years to make health insurance cheaper and easier to get, expanding coverage to some 5m Americans who are now uninsured, and $28bn over 10 years to offer a $3,000 tax credit for people who need long-term health care. On education, he asked for about $5bn to expand after-school and summer school programs; give more money to Head Start, the early child development program; hire more teachers to reduce class size; offer bonuses to states that improve school performance; improve the quality of teachers, and build new schools and repair old ones. And he requested $30bn over 10 years to offer up to $2,800 in tax relief for college students or their families.",

It's good for his career, for your career.\" \"We just got so tired of this secret,\" says Etheridge, who didn't even tell the rest of her family the father's name until the couple's first child, Bailey, was a year old. \"It wears you out. And keeping this big secret goes against how we are choosing to live our lives: very openly.\" There was also the consideration that Bailey, now three, will attend school soon: \"I didn't want my kids to ever be in a position where someone could come up to them and know something they don't.\"</p> <p>\"Because Bailey was starting to ask,\" adds Cypher. \"And you know what else? It was becoming a joke, more than it should have been.\" Thus, after much discussion, the two have decided to reveal the identity of their two children's biological father. It is a man whose name, it is safe to say, has never come up on a shortlist of candidates. It is, of all people, David Crosby, founding member of The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, a rock'n'roll bad boy with a four-decade-long career, a wife of 12 years and a 35-year-old son.</p> <p>Etheridge and Cypher live in a spacious 1926 Tudor home filled with sunlight, honey-coloured wood and antiques in Los Angeles. It is a very different home from the one that the pair lived in four years ago, with its careful display of antique match strikers and its Louvre-size collection of dog photos. Now, the effluvia of children are everywhere: half-drunk glasses of juice in plastic cups, Elmo in various permutations, milk and bananas on the grocery list. The match strikers have been relegated to a glass case. As for the dog photos: \"Bruce Springsteen once gave me the best parenting advice,\" says Cypher. \"He said, 'You know, all of a sudden, your dogs are just gonna be dogs.'\"</p> <p>Cypher and Etheridge give a tour of their house, pointing out a black baby grand piano in the sitting room before moving on to the toy-strewn family room. \"This is the room we live in,\" says Cypher. Against one wall is a row of seats from the community theatre in Etheridge's hometown of Leavenworth, Kansas, that the establishment gave to her after she made a donation to help restore it. The two point out a Maori school desk they found in New Zealand. \"We love, love, love to antique-shop,\" says Cypher.</p> <p>Bailey races into the room. \"Look at me!\" she cries, hurling herself onto a beanbag chair. \"I'm just a laughing frog!\" One-year-old Beckett, meanwhile, is being fed by a nanny. The children, whose faces are sweet and apple-cheeked, could be lifted out of a Victorian postcard. \"Beckett looks just like David, doesn't he?\" says Etheridge, looking on happily, a rock-chick mom in a blue corduroy jacket with silver studs. She produces Crosby's autobiography, which contains a baby photo from back in the day. The resemblance is eerie.</p> <p>It all began in Hawaii, they say, where the two were vacationing. They dropped by to visit David Crosby and his missus, Jan, whom they had met a while back at a show. \"We'd see them every now and then at a party, stuff like that,\" says Etheridge. As the group chatted, the subject of children came up, and Etheridge and Cypher mentioned their dilemma. Eggs they had. Sperm was another matter.</p> <p>\"And Jan said, 'What about David?'\" says Etheridge. \"It came from her, which was the best, most perfect way.\" They thought it over for a year before they made the call. \"For one, he's musical, which means a lot to me, you know, and I admire his work,\" continues Etheridge. \"And he has his own life, has his own family.\"</p> <p>A few questions:</p> <p>What do the kids call you?</p> <p>\"I am Mama, Julie is Mamo,\" says Etheridge.</p> <p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but how did the fertilisation occur?</p> <p>\"It was artificial insemination, done privately,\" says Cypher.</p> <p>\"We did not use a turkey baster,\" adds Etheridge.</p> <p>\"No kitchen implements were involved,\" says Cypher.</p> <p>It was decided that she should carry the babies because of Etheridge's work. \"I was more the homebody, so to speak,\" Cypher says. \"And I'm a health nut, a fanatic, so I was really good at making babies.\"</p> <p>Are the Crosbys godparents?</p> <p>\"No, that would be our dearest friends,\" she says, pointing to a picture of a smiling man and woman. \"Beckett's role model,\" she says, pointing to the man.</p> <p>\"For people who are worried about the male role model,\" says Etheridge. \"So many people are worried about that male role model.\"</p> <p>\"Sometimes they have a hard time wrapping their head around the fact that this can work,\" says Cypher.</p> <p>Kate Capshaw - who, with her husband Steven Spielberg, has hung out with the couple for the past two years - says she thought that the news was fantastic.

Obvious danger signs to watch out for are the first sproutings of Crosby's walrus moustache on either child; and, if they start ranting Crosby-style about the evils of Richard Nixon and CIA covert action in central America, the experiment will have to be declared a catastrophic failure. But by they reach adulthood, science might be able to help. They may opt for a career in politics, and re-encode themselves with George W Bush's gene pool. Or, if they just want to be rich, they could try a genetic infusion of Bill Gates, despite the warning on the packet about developing a goofy grin and an awful haircut. They won't want to be musicians though, because Wall Street will have swallowed the music business and turned it into an internet computer game.</p>",

Her 1993 album Yes I Am established her as a star with Top 40 appeal, but proved the high point of her commercial success. However, her campaigning work for gay rights, civil rights and animal rights has sustained her as a fully paid-up member of the showbiz liberal elite. So, what future for the offspring? Obvious danger signs to watch out for are the first sproutings of Crosby's walrus moustache on either child; and, if they start ranting Crosby-style about the evils of Richard Nixon and CIA covert action in central America, the experiment will have to be declared a catastrophic failure. But by they reach adulthood, science might be able to help. They may opt for a career in politics, and re-encode themselves with George W Bush's gene pool. Or, if they just want to be rich, they could try a genetic infusion of Bill Gates, despite the warning on the packet about developing a goofy grin and an awful haircut. They won't want to be musicians though, because Wall Street will have swallowed the music business and turned it into an internet computer game.",

Talk to a food technologist and words such as \"savoury\", \"full-bodied\" and \"brothy\" will crop up frequently. Even Kikunae Ikeda, the Tokyo scientist who first isolated the source of the taste, could only think to christen it \"umami\" which - exotic though it sounds to the untrained ear - means something close to \"yummy\" in Japanese.</p> <p>Umami is the mysterious \"fifth taste\" - a flavour that has never seemed to fit into the existing categories of sweet, sour, salty and bitter. South-east Asian chefs have exploited it throughout history - it's an essential part of the taste of seaweed, among other things - and Ikeda identified it as long ago as 1908, demonstrating that the food substance usually responsible for stimulating the taste was glutamic acid; parmesan cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms and peas are loaded with it. And yet, until last week, scientists' attempts to develop Ikeda's insights - and, crucially, to find out whether or not umami really is a distinct taste - had progressed at an excruciatingly slow pace.</p> <p>\"We can't even be sure that we're having the same experience when we taste it,\" says Barham. \"We all know what 'sweet' means, because we're used to tasting sugar, and we all know what 'bitter' means if we drink gin and tonic. But there's no one thing you can put in your mouth and say 'that's umami'. Parmesan certainly has a different effect to cheddar when you put it on your pasta, but it's a combination effect - and it's virtually indescribable.\" The debate over umami has raged within the tiny global community of taste scientists for years, and, says Barham, goes to the heart of the question of what taste itself really is. He characterises the disagreements thus: \"What defines a taste? What makes something discrete and different, and what defines a taste receptor on the tongue? Does umami have a discrete receptor or not?\"</p> <p>Now, though, it seems that much of the mystery may have been solved. Writing in next month's edition of the journal Nature Neuroscience, biophysicist Dr Nirupa Chaudhari and her colleagues at the University of Miami announce a breakthrough: elaborating on their earlier investigations into the taste buds of rats, the researchers have isolated a protein molecule present on the tongue which, uniquely, enables us to taste umami foods - and thus to savour a vintage parmesan or a ripe tomato. Known as taste-mGluR4, it's a version of a protein also found in the human brain. On the tongue, though, it is truncated - which explains why glutamic acid must be present in relatively high concentrations before umami can be detected.</p> <p>In the kitchens of the Fat Duck at Bray, umami is viewed with a mixture of enthusiasm and suspicion. \"From a restaurant point of view, we're seeing something of an umami explosion - people finding all the things that have umami and chucking them all into a dish together,\" says Blumenthal. The taste is evoked more subtly in his own dishes, but reaches its fullest expression in the Fat Duck's roast scallop and caramelised cauliflower with marinated cep and jelly of Oloroso sherry. \"Caramelising the cabbage enhances the umami taste, and scallops taste of it too, but then the sherry jelly counterbalances it and brings the whole dish together.\"</p> <p>Perhaps unfortunately, though, Britain is best acquainted with umami via the ubiquitous gloopiness of monosodium glutamate (MSG), the powdered flavour enhancer on which your local Chinese takeaway almost certainly relies. It gives a concentrated umami hit, but it's a controversial additive - several studies have claimed that up to 30% of the population react adversely to it, displaying symptoms including migraines, hives, asthma attacks and cardiac irregulaties. Britain's Institute for Food Research insists that it's safe, but many of the smarter Chinese restaurants now spurn it, looking to natural sources of the same flavouring instead. Christine Yau, of the Ming restaurant on Greek Street in central London, runs a school for professional Chinese chefs at which MSG is a dirty word.</p> <p>\"A lot of cooks have misused it, and so our students are not allowed to,\" says Yau. \"MSG is not something that you need in cooking; it enhances and brings out the flavours of good foods, but if you use it with bad materials it just makes things taste worse. We do use it occasionally at Ming, for dishes such as chicken and cashew nuts, which might otherwise be a bit bland. But the same taste occurs naturally in some kinds of vegetables, such as pak-choi cabbage and green leaves. It's a unique taste; there's a hint of sweetness there, but it's not just sweet.\"</p> <p>There is certainly something strangely potent about the taste. Snack manufacturers have long been criticised for adding MSG to their products, at least partly because it seems to have the curious power to encourage further consumption, almost against the purchaser's will. It is being used experimentally to administer food to people suffering from cancer who lose their appetites entirely; Japanese studies of babies' facial expressions show marked signs of exceptional pleasure when they taste it.</p> <p>Mysterious and exotic as umami seems, though, it is actually one of the tastes about which we know a relatively large amount: the taste receptors for sweetness and bitterness are still unknown. \"It's in the west, alone, that umami has only been taken seriously in the past two or three years,\" says Barham. \"The entire eastern world has known about it for centuries.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Age: 39. Nationality: English. Restaurant: Le Champignon Sauvage, 24-26 Suffolk Road, Cheltenham, GL50. Tel: 01242 573449. Past form: \"I started at the Inn on the Park (now the Four Seasons), then went to Steamers, which specialised in fish, and to Fingal's in Fulham. I've worked with Edouard Hari and Pierre Koffmann. My wife Helen and I set up Le Champignon Sauvage 13 years ago this July. Style of cooking: French terroir - food of the earth, but with modern spicing. Signature dishes: Roasted scallops and baby squid with pumpkin pur\u00e9e and squid ink; Wiltshire pork with homemade black pudding and chou farci; feuillantine of mango and Thai-spiced cream. Bookshelf: Pierre Koffmann's Memories of Gascony is an insight into what makes, in my opinion, the best chef in Great Britain. Michel Guerard's Cuisine Gourmande is as relevant today as it was when it came out in 1978. Other favourites are Lindsey Bareham's In Praise of the Potato, and Nigella Lawson's How to Eat. If I can learn one new technique from a book, I'm very satisfied. Favourite restaurant (other than own): In London, Tante Claire, Gordon Ramsay's, and anywhere that Bruno Loubet or Eric Crouilli\u00e8re-Chavot (currently at The Capital) are cooking. Favourite food: When eating out, foie gras, scallops, sweetbreads. Eating in, it's roast chicken or liver and bacon. What's in your fridge? The bare essentials - milk, butter, margarine. We prefer to prepare what we've bought when it's as fresh as possible, so there's no point in stocking up. What did you have for breakfast? Porridge, black coffee, juice, a poached egg and roast chicken. Top tip: Cook what you like to eat, and you'll have more confidence. Biggest culinary disaster: In the Chef of the Year competition, my mixer fell off, with my egg whites for the dessert. But I still won in the end. These little things happen. Career high: Opening the restaurant, and, most recently, getting the second Michelin star. Interview by Claire Phipps",

      "body": "<p>Exactly three years ago I attended the Sundance film festival, in the ski resort of Park City, Utah, fresh off a week-long intensive stint at Robert Redford's Sundance Institute's screenwriters' lab. It was the first time a British writer-director had been invited to the lab. This year I'm returning with the same script - What's Cooking? - now finished and given the honour of opening this year's festival. </p> <p>Sitting in the audience on opening night in 1997, I would never have guessed I'd be up there on that podium introducing my film. I was numb from the lab, where my script had been heavily scrutinised by an illustrious group of Hollywood writers with often parochial comments. My co-writer and husband, Paul Mayeda Berges, and I were frustrated by the feedback we'd received. The writers at the lab wanted us to push our script in a direction I knew wasn't right for my vision of \"Americanness\". </p> <p>What's Cooking? interweaves four diverse Los Angeles families - African-American, Latino, Vietnamese, and Jewish - as they come together to celebrate Thanksgiving: Americana through British Asian eyes. I had the idea for the film while I was in LA promoting my first film, Bhaji on the Beach. The film was well received and scripts from the studios started to come in, but as I read them I kept thinking, Los Angeles is such an exciting city and what I was seeing wasn't reflected in the scripts. If you've only experienced LA through films and TV, you'd have no sense of the richness and diversity of the city: 70% of LA schools are Latino and over 200 languages are spoken. LA is the great American experiment realised. </p> <p>After the Screenwriter's Lab, we spent the next two years trying to get the film made. Most film companies loved the script, but no one knew how they would sell it. There had never been a film made with all these communities together that wasn't about \"problems\" between them. They knew the film would appeal to all these audiences, but they weren't sure how to market it to the different ethnic groups represented. </p> <p>Approaching actors was a different story. We gave the script, a video of Bhaji On the Beach and a great letter of support for the project from Robert Redford to Alfre Woodard, Julianna Margulies, Mercedes Ruehl, Joan Chen and Kyra Sedgwick. They all said the same thing: I want to be a part of it. With a great cast attached, we finally raised private equity finance and made it as a truly independent film. For my first film in America, I had a privilege most other directors never get - no editorial interference.</p> <p>We shot the film in May 1999 on location in LA over 25 days - pretty tight on a film with 42 speaking parts eating their way through 32 turkeys. I was knocked out by the generosity and professionalism of the US cast and crew. Not one person said, \"Oh no love, you don't want to do that...\" </p> <p>We completed the film in November and submitted it to Sundance. I hoped they would like it, but I was completely over the moon when they selected it to open the festival. When we flew into Salt Lake City for the film's world premiere, none of the actors, the public or anyone from the industry had seen it. As I saw industry people milling around baggage claim I began to get nervous: 2,000 people, what if they don't get it... </p> <p>We got to the hotel and there were five make-up people waiting to do Alfre Woodard and Julianna Margulies, but both of them decided to do their own make-up so they spent the next three hours working on me. Meanwhile there were 10 people in my room - someone trying to pluck my eyebrows, a woman waiting to blow-dry my hair, Paul and his friends breaking open champagne - and I still hadn't decided what to wear. Should I dress traditional Indian \"elegant\" or western \"power-dressy\"? The hair and make-up team voted Indian hands down. </p> <p>We were taken to a pre-opening night party for the governor. All the actors were there and everyone was nervous but excited to finally see the film. I grabbed a drink and some food before we were led in front of a huge line of cameras, photographers and press outside the hall. I had Alfre on one side and Julianna on the other as all the cameras clicked furiously. I saw Paul glaring at me from the side. He pointed to my tooth - blimey, I had some broccoli wedged in there. We had to hover backstage because we were on \"Bob time\" - that's 20 minutes late for the screening because we're waiting for Robert Redford to show up. </p> <p>On stage the festival director introduced me. I told the audience that when I was a young girl in London I thought \"Salt Lake City\" and \"Utah\" were very exotic places. They looked surprised. I confessed it was because my bedroom walls were covered with posters of Donny Osmond. Of course the local crowd warmed to this. Later I learnt that Donny's best friend was in the audience and Donny really wanted to come but couldn't get a ticket! Paul said this is the only town where I would be applauded for my Donny Osmond infatuation. </p> <p>The film began and I felt the buzz from the audience. Their laughter echoed throughout the enormous opera hall, sometimes over the next several lines of dialogue. I felt proud that we were able to make the film exactly as we wanted, even if it did take us five years to finish it. </p> <p>At the party everyone was beaming. A woman asked me when it's coming to Albuquerque so she can take her family to see it. Robert Redford said he loved the film but was freaking out - we actually filmed on the LA street that he grew up on. He remembered all the houses because his dad was a milkman and delivered there. </p> <p>Festival co-director Geoff Gilmore said it was the best opening night they'd ever had. He introduced me to the president of a major festival's sponsor, who told me he could arrange for me to meet Donny Osmond. I realised that no matter how well the film was received that night, it was the end of my street cred forever.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In life the novelist Patricia Highsmith habitually drew strong reactions from those around her. Like Brigitte Bardot, she appears to have reserved most of her affection for animals: when she died, in 1995, she left behind 22 novels, mostly studies of everyday psychopathy, and a lifetime's worth of sketches of cats. Her sometime publisher Otto Penzler described her as a \"mean, cruel, hard, unlovable, unloving human being\" - and he was a fan. </p> <p>Nor is Highsmith likely to find immortality as a feminist icon: her early books are notable for their negative portrayal of female characters. When questioned about her preference for male heroes, the author would reply: \"Women are tied to the home... Men can do more, jump over fences.\" </p> <p>But, as we all know, a bad character has never been a bar to creating good art, and Highsmith's claustrophobic studies of commonplace deviancy have been entertaining and appalling readers for a half-century now. In particular, they have found a receptive audience among film-makers. When Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley opens across the UK next month, it will be almost exactly 50 years since Highsmith was first adapted for the big screen. </p> <p>That initial cinematic translation was in 1951, with Strangers on a Train by Alfred Hitchcock, and it made Highsmith famous - not to say well-off - overnight. In the intervening period, many others have felt drawn to the author's gallery of literary sociopaths: Claude-Autant Lara (Le Meutrier, 1963), Claude Miller (Dites-lui que je l'aime, 1977), Michel Deville (Eaux Profondes, 1981) and Claude Chabrol (Le Cri du Hibou, 1987) have all made films based on her work.</p> <p>In addition there have been two previous attempts to adapt Highsmith's most celebrated creation, the genial psychopath Tom Ripley: Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment filmed The Talented Mr Ripley as Plein Soleil, starring a very young Alain Delon, in 1960 (reissued in 1997 by Miramax, the company behind Minghella's version), while a later volume in Highsmith's Ripley series, Ripley's Game, was the basis for Wim Wenders's 1977 The American Friend. </p> <p>But just as the foregoing list attests to Highsmith's popularity with film-makers (particularly ones called Claude), it also shows a marked bias for her work among European cin\u00e9astes. There is no real mystery about Hollywood's shyness where Highsmith is concerned, for the author - though an American - was positively opposed to the key film industry tenet that the good should be rewarded and the wicked punished. As she once said, \"I find the public passion for justice quite boring and artificial, for neither life nor nature cares if justice is ever done or not.\" </p> <p>No one who knows Highsmith only through American screen adaptations will therefore have much of a sense of the novels' characteristic moral climate. Hitchcock's version of Strangers on a Train has little in common with its source material beyond a general misogyny and an opening proposition - two men, one a psychopath, one not, meet on a train and discuss their difficulties with their respective families. Suddenly the psychopath slams his palms together and cries out euphorically: \"Hey! Cheeses. What an idea! We murder for each other, see? I kill your wife and you kill my father! We meet on a train, see, and nobody knows we know each other! Perfect alibis! Catch?\" </p> <p>Thereafter film and novel diverge significantly. In the cinema version the good guy is never allowed even to contemplate going through with his side of the bargain - at worst he risks being thought guilty by other people. In the novel, on the other hand, the honest citizen actually carries out the killing and becomes possessed by guilt; such is Highsmith's skill that the process by which he comes to commit the murder seems entirely logical, and all the more terrible for that. As Susannah Clapp observed in a recent issue of the New Yorker: \"In Highsmith, the corruption of good intentions is so insidious that it comes to seem a perfectly natural process.\" Conventional notions of justice - legal, divine, poetic - have no force in Highsmith's world. </p> <p>Highsmith does not appear to have invited discussion of her personal life, but the established biographical facts are none the less worth rehearsing. Her parents separated five months before she was born, in Fort Worth, Texas in 1921, and she was raised initially by her grandmother.</p> <p>This happy period was cut short when she was summoned to join her mother in New York, where the two women appear to have formed a lethal partnership worthy of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?; mother taunting daughter by relating how she had tried to abort her foetus during pregnancy. \"She really tried to get rid of it - she told me - I didn't mind,\" Highsmith later remembered. \"She said, 'It's funny you adore the smell of turpentine, Pat'. Because she drank turpentine before I was born trying to have a miscarriage. I didn't mind.\" </p> <p>It is an extraordinary story, not least for the way in which Highsmith tells it, managing to make a monstrous revelation seem entirely ordinary, an effect that Highsmith achieves again and again in her fiction. In the circumstances it is perhaps understandable that Highsmith hated her mother and blamed her for her own later inability to live with others. </p> <p>As a young adult, the novelist toyed with various careers, briefly pursuing writing for comic books: interested readers can still find the children's title Miranda the Panda is On the Veranda in the collection of the British Library. She almost became a painter, too. It will come as no surprise to learn that she was particularly drawn to the work of Francis Bacon: humanity vomiting into a toilet bowl struck a chord. </p> <p>But recognition as a writer was not long withheld from her. In 1945 her first short story, The Heroine, was published in Harper's Bazaar. Soon after, on a recommendation from Truman Capote, she went to stay at the Yaddo writers' colony, redrafted Strangers on a Train, found a publisher in Harper &amp; Sons and achieved international success - though, mirroring the tastes of film-makers, her books have traditionally had a larger audience in Europe than in the US. The novelist herself moved to Britain and France in the 1960s before finally settling in Switzerland. </p> <p>When it was first published in 1950, Strangers on a Train was advertised by its publishers as \"A Harper Novel of Suspense\". If you go in search of a copy today, you will discover that the label has stuck, for her works are usually kept in the specialist crime or thriller sections of bookstores rather than among general fiction. </p> <p>Although Highsmith is still thought of as a genre writer, her most obvious literary relations are rather grander than the classification would suggest. In the first place there is Henry James, another European-American puritan obsessed with the isolated consciousness and the destructive powers of the imagination: a James tale such as Maud-Evelyn shares many of the preoccupations of Highsmith's This Sweet Sickness. James's influence is hinted at explicitly in The Talented Mr Ripley when Mr Green leaf asks Tom if he has ever read The Ambassadors - in fact the plot of Ripley, in which an American is sent to Europe to try to persuade a fellow countryman to return home, is borrowed directly from James, albeit with an important twist. </p> <p>However, the literary movement that most obviously marks Highsmith's work is European existentialism, from her beloved Dostoevsky and Gide through to Camus and Sartre - it is one of the constant lessons of these tales of individuals destroying one another that hell is other people.</p> <p>Viewed in his proper postwar context, Tom Ripley is at once a psychopath and an existentialist hero. The series of books that Highsmith devoted to him - The Talented Mr Ripley (1955), Ripley Underground (1970), Ripley's Game (1974), The Boy Who Followed Ripley (1980) and Ripley Under Water (1990) - are a classic, if rather perverse, existentialist statement of the freedom of the individual to recreate him- or herself. Moreover, Ripley's murder of Dickie Greenleaf in the perfect tranquillity of San Remo is not without an echo in another seaside murder, that committed by Meursault in Camus's The Outsider. </p> <p>In the existentialist tradition, the irrationality of human behaviour is an abiding theme. As Graham Greene wrote of Highsmith: \"Her characters are irrational and they leap to life in the very lack of reason; suddenly we realise how unbelievably rational most fictional characters are.\"</p> <p>One of the principal experiences of reading the novels is frustration: the reader's terrible sense of entrapment that comes with having to follow the mental processes of a character who consistently refuses to act in his own best interests. When, in A Suspension of Mercy, the writer Sydney Bartleby sets out to behave in a way that makes him seem guilty of his wife's murder, the reader is left to despair at the terrible lucidity of a consciousness ensnaring itself in absurdist Kafkaesque traps of its own devising. </p> <p>Isolation, absurdity, irrationality: the philosophical essence of Highsmith's fiction is not obviously cinematic. As Russell Harrison points out in his monograph on the writer, it is the absence or displacement of many of the staples of realistic fiction that gives the novels their compelling, unique oddness. Politics, social observation, sex - these are all simply missing from most of Highsmith's earliest and best work. </p> <p>Sex, or the lack of it, in Highsmith is particularly intriguing. Highsmith presents a world in which her characters are cut adrift, determined neither by family nor work duties. The consequences of removing all such moral and professional props can be spectacularly disorientating. </p> <p>When Ripley is about to kill Richard Greenleaf, we are told: \"He could have hit Dickie, sprung on him, or kissed him, or thrown him overboard.\" That there is a homoerotic element in the relationships drawn by Highsmith between her male characters has not passed unremarked by critics, nor by Minghella in his screen adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley. However, in the novels, faced with the choice between killing or kissing, Highsmith's creations will almost invariably choose the former. There is one notable exception, however, for in an early work Highsmith did experiment with allowing her characters more explicit sexual existences and a conventional \"happy ending\". </p> <p>The novel in question is The Price of Salt, which was first published in 1952 under the pseudonym Claire Morgan and which rapidly became an underground lesbian classic, selling nearly a million copies. When Highsmith finally owned up to the work in 1990, her explanation for the upbeat treatment of the gay lovers had a familiarly perverse ring, although here her insistence on going against the grain will strike most readers as more humane in its motivation: she had, she said, allowed the couple to find happiness in their relationship because \"homosexuals male and female in American novels have had to pay for their deviation by cutting their wrists, drowning themselves in a swimming pool, or by switching to heterosexuality.\" </p> <p>Ironically, The Price of Salt is one of the rare occasions when Highsmith's fiction indulges the desire for poetic justice so beloved of Hollywood producers - but, given its explicit subject matter and its leading female roles, it is probably the least likely of Highsmith's novels to be adapted for big-screen presentation.</p> <p>\u0095 The Talented Mr Ripley is released on February 25.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In life the novelist Patricia Highsmith habitually drew strong reactions from those around her. Like Brigitte Bardot, she appears to have reserved most of her affection for animals: when she died, in 1995, she left behind 22 novels, mostly studies of everyday psychopathy, and a lifetime's worth of sketches of cats. Her sometime publisher Otto Penzler described her as a \"mean, cruel, hard, unlovable, unloving human being\" - and he was a fan. Nor is Highsmith likely to find immortality as a feminist icon: her early books are notable for their negative portrayal of female characters. When questioned about her preference for male heroes, the author would reply: \"Women are tied to the home... Men can do more, jump over fences.\" But, as we all know, a bad character has never been a bar to creating good art, and Highsmith's claustrophobic studies of commonplace deviancy have been entertaining and appalling readers for a half-century now. In particular, they have found a receptive audience among film-makers. When Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley opens across the UK next month, it will be almost exactly 50 years since Highsmith was first adapted for the big screen. That initial cinematic translation was in 1951, with Strangers on a Train by Alfred Hitchcock, and it made Highsmith famous - not to say well-off - overnight.

      "body": "<p>Mary Whitehouse was right. Screen violence does corrupt the young. Not even film-makers themselves are immune. Take the sorry story of Shane Meadows, one of our most ebullient directors. One summer afternoon - his mind filled with God knows what horrors after watching a TV matinee of Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales - Meadows grabbed a rifle and went out on to the streets of one of Uttoxeter's better council estates to take terrible revenge on Paul Fraser for not playing badminton with him. Fraze, his next-door neighbour and best friend since birth, was shot down like a dog. OK, so they were 11 at the time, and it was only an air rifle, but the hurt and the guilt linger. </p> <p>Meadows, a man as acquainted with shame as he is with the grooming habits of the lesser lemurs of the Outer Comores, still blushes at the memory. \"I was aiming at the wall. Honest, I was.\" Fraser pulls up his T-shirt to show where the wound was. \"It was the biggest pea-sized bruise you have ever seen... My mum always said I should stay away from you.\" </p> <p>Janet Fraser took a dim view of Shane. She knew trouble when she saw it (Meadows would later appear in court for the theft of a breast pump. We'll not mention the dodgy second-hand chopper business he ran from his back garden). Janet also had the fastest smack in the West Midlands, and vengeance was swift. \"I'd rather have faced Ali,\" says Meadows. </p> <p>It was the beginning of the end of their boyhood together. That and a bit of horseplay on a swing, which Shane got blamed for and which aggravated an injury to Fraser's back. Fraser, a quiet lad, spent nearly two years recovering in bed, living in his own head, learning magic tricks and collecting Pepsi cans. \"I don't know why, but when you're 12 you do these things.\" Janet first kept chubby, chatty Shane away, but he soon stopped calling anyway. He was getting his teenage kicks early, piggybacking on the older boys who fancied his big sister to gain entry into worlds \"no child should have been near\". </p> <p>It doesn't sound like much, but it was from such childish things that his new film came. A Room For Romeo Brass is the story of Fraser and Meadows's lifelong friendship and how their loyalty to one another was tested in that odd, dangerous and peculiarly unexplored period before the claxon bells of puberty start ringing in your pants. It neatly brings to a close Meadow's \"Nottingham trilogy\", on which Fraser also worked, the low-budget Small Time and the feature TwentyFourSeven, yet far surpasses both in scope and subtlety. </p> <p>Edinburgh in August is a city of strange sights. But even among nude Azerbijani chicken jugglers and Phill Jupitus in shorts, Shane Meadows's Midland posse turned heads on the way to the film festival awards. All dressed in flared white suits, with shaven-headed Shane giving it at that up front, it looked for all the world that Blaxpoitation had been born in Burton-on-Trent and not Burbank. You wouldn't expect less from a man who made 30 short films, and an international reputation, with a video camera borrowed from Nottingham DSS. </p> <p>Andrew Shim, the child actor who plays Romeo Brass is a ringer for Meadows both on and off screen - first to the microphone and last to leave the table. There is only one slight difference. Andrew is black. Ben Marshall, who plays the Fraser role \"Knock Knocks\", is just as fair and hangs back just like Fraze. Vicky McClure (Romeo's gobby sister Ladine) stares at her shoes, and covers her shyness by looking dead bored in that way teenagers do. The following week's Variety, the Hollywood bible, will fawn over her performance. </p> <p>Meanwhile Paddy Considine, who plays Morell, the weird estate idiot who comes between the friends, is cracking jokes in the cinema foyer. Paddy's a very good photographer. You may have seen his studies of bare-knuckle fighters. He's also funny, very funny. There are impersonations, mad, frighteningly fast improvisations, sudden dazzling changes of pace. It begins to go quiet. The room is watching him. He is better than anything I've seen in three weeks of fringe comedy. Steve Coogan couldn't live with this man. Paddy will be back on the dole in Burton come Monday. </p> <p>Back in an Edinburgh hotel too snooty to serve Irn-Bru, Fraser and Meadows are confessing their childhood crimes against a kid called Squirrel. \"He was the kid they tested things on,\" says Meadows. \"We couldn't wait to be one of the big lads, to be able to spit and play football properly. You would do anything to hang around with them. </p> <p>\"I remember them getting this big piece of ice from a pond once - it was so thick they were fish still in it - and making us lie round in the circle so they could drop it on our heads. They smashed it on poor Squirrel. He was not a well boy. When he came to, they promised to give him some of their Chinese if he put a couple of coats on and ran round a bit so they could use him for target practice for their air rifles... Later when the big lads were blooding me into their gang, they held Squirrel down so I could give him a kicking. That was the kind of things we did.\"</p> <p>It was their realisation that such cruelties were not confined to Westland Road, Uttoxeter, and prompting from Meadows's dying grandfather, that persuaded them to sit down together and write about their friendship. \"After TwentyFourSeven, I thought we should do a genre film or something. We were sitting in Stratford thinking about this Welsh western,\" says Meadows. \"But my grandfather reminded me about Fraser. When you think about it, how many guys brought up on either side of a semi-detached council house in Uttoxeter go on to make film in their mid-20s? </p> <p>\"Fraser's creative edge was always apparent. I remember him winning this big writing competition. When he was sick I got in with these pretty dodgy older blokes. You think they are great, they've got cars and all, and you don't see the dangers. I saw things a child shouldn't see. I saw a kid get a kicking from a guy who just wanted to impress me. He was stamping on his head and everything. That's when I realised I had to get out of this. I tried to be a tough guy, but when I was exposed to real violence it did my head in.\" </p> <p>After neglecting his sick mate for 18 months - several lifetimes when you're 11 - Meadows eventually skulked back up the stairs to see him. \"To be forgiven by someone when you have done nothing for them except be a pain in the arse was a big thing for me,\" he said. \"He had been cooped up in that box room going through puberty on his own, and I hadn't been there for him. I had changed a lot too, and in ways I hated Fraser because he hadn't seen what I had. I felt kind of dirty.\" </p> <p>Those were not the only things that had altered in those two years. When Fraser did emerge from his bed he had a cockney accent as well - \"I saw this cockney bloke get off with a girl at the pool; I thought it was cool,\" he said. \"I remember coming up to Shane in the corridor of the high school and saying 'Watcha mate!' Everyone was thinking 'Who is this kid?' Shane had a bit of a reputation and I think he was embarrassed by this snotty little arse.\" \"Too right,\" says Meadows, \"my credibility was at stake.\" </p> <p>\"One day he told me I had to belt this guy to prove myself,\" says Fraser. \"So I went up to this kid and whacked him, but he didn't go down. He didn't even move. Shane was behind me saying, 'Whack him again, Fraze.' I did, but he still wouldn't fight. I looked a twat and I got detention for it as well.\" </p> <p>His career as a goon over before it started, blond, blue-eyed Fraser became the second-form heart-throb instead. \"It was only later when sensitive Fraze pulled this really great girlfriend that I realised that my big masculine thing had gone right out of fashion,\" says Meadows. \"So I got wacky fast and joined the school play to get near the girls. But we still played up to the older lads. We'd do these little comedy routines for them in the arch down the town centre - nativity plays outside pubs even. They thought we were just these mad kids, but they accepted us.\" </p> <p>It is this gift for play that may explain why the pair have got so much out of their young actors. Apart from Bob Hoskins, Frank Harper and Ladene Hall, who have all been round the block, the guts of the cast was drawn from the Central Junior TV Workshop in Nottingham. They rehearsed and workshopped the script for three months. </p> <p>Meadows was determined that after TwentyFourSeven, which won prizes, was liked by critics, but wasn't seen by a huge public, he wanted to make a truly populist film. \"I would hate to make a festival circuit film about two lads... that's not what I'm about.\" What Meadows will no doubt shortly be about is big-budget films. He wants do a few TV things, and a couple of smaller DVD projects with Fraser, but it's clear he's knows a call from a studio is not far away. \"It was good to do it while I still could,\" he said. If that means his almost telepathic partnership with Fraser is put on the back burner, the loss will be even more ours than theirs.</p> <p>\u0095 A Room for Romeo Brass opens on February 4.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> The Mummy</strong><br>Rental, retail and DVD \u00a319.99<br>Universal Pictures Cert 12 <br> ***</p> <p>Loosely hung on the bones of the old Boris Karloff films started by the same studio in 1932, The Mummy is conceived much more as Indiana Jones meets the Ungrateful Dead. It chucks lots of top-of-the-range FX at the screen, often at the expense of narrative coherence. The film's plagues, for example - locusts, rats, beetles and a sort of human sandstorm - are highly impressive but come from a different story altogether. \"It's Egypt already, let's do plagues,\" seems to be the thinking here.</p> <p>The plague of ancient racial stereotyping rears its head too - don't expect to see any noble, incorruptible or even clean locals. It's set in 1926, but I don't think that's an excuse. The actors are inevitably secondary, but Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are appealing in stock roles. Fraser, already adept at goofy comedy and the subtle drama of Gods and Monsters, is also a natural for an action hero. He's got the physique and moves well enough without quite being in Banderas's league. Weisz has the best comedy scene when she brings an entire library down through the domino effect and an enjoyable drunk scene: \"I am proud of what I am.

      "bodyText": "The Mummy Rental, retail and DVD \u00a319.99 Universal Pictures Cert 12 *** Loosely hung on the bones of the old Boris Karloff films started by the same studio in 1932, The Mummy is conceived much more as Indiana Jones meets the Ungrateful Dead. It chucks lots of top-of-the-range FX at the screen, often at the expense of narrative coherence. The film's plagues, for example - locusts, rats, beetles and a sort of human sandstorm - are highly impressive but come from a different story altogether. \"It's Egypt already, let's do plagues,\" seems to be the thinking here. The plague of ancient racial stereotyping rears its head too - don't expect to see any noble, incorruptible or even clean locals. It's set in 1926, but I don't think that's an excuse. The actors are inevitably secondary, but Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are appealing in stock roles. Fraser, already adept at goofy comedy and the subtle drama of Gods and Monsters, is also a natural for an action hero. He's got the physique and moves well enough without quite being in Banderas's league. Weisz has the best comedy scene when she brings an entire library down through the domino effect and an enjoyable drunk scene: \"I am proud of what I am. I am a librarian.\" (This is actually the only line I can remember from writer-director Stephen Sommers's script). At times Fraser and the initially prissy Weisz play it as if they're doing The African Queen with sand for water. Everything here seems to come from other movies.

The row has created uncertainty for SMS's 500 employees in Northern Ireland - and 50 in France - just as Thomson is due to take control on Monday. Denis Ranque, Thomson's chairman, was savouring his coup in buying Racal for \u00a31.35bn when he received a letter from Philippe Camus, A\u00e9rospatiale's chief executive, warning that he would exercise an option to take 49% of SMS's equity. Mr Ranque, who had bought out the 50% stake in SMS held by Bombardier, Shorts' Canadian owner, retorted that A\u00e9rospatiale had no legal basis for claiming that option. French observers said yesterday that Mr Camus, whose group controls Europe's biggest missile maker, Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD), with BAE Systems, had no intention of allowing its biggest French rival to establish a substantial presence in this sector. MBD is poised to win a \u00a31bn order from the UK to supply Eurofighter with its \"smart\" missiles and is seeking to forge a pan-European rival to Raytheon, the American missiles group. A\u00e9rospatiale officials said yesterday that the 49% option over SMS dated from a 1993 agreement between itself and Thomson, and talks continued on the issue.

      "bodyText": "British defence firms stand to win orders worth at least \u00a36bn if Boeing wins the contract to build the Joint Strike Fighter, senior executives of the American planemaker said yesterday. The programme could be worth an astonishing $300bn in export orders, guaranteeing tens of thousands of UK jobs, and pits a team built around Boeing against one led by Lockheed Martin, the world's biggest defence contractor. The multi-role combat aircraft is being developed to replace fighters such as the F-16 and F-22 for the US airforce, navy and marines - and the ageing Harriers of the Royal Navy and RAF, which want 60 and 90 planes respectively. It could provide the main thrust of the rapid reaction forces being built up by the UK and its European partners, notably on the two new aircraft carriers being planned by the ministry of defence. But the overall programme could involve up to 5,000 planes, with the USAF alone ordering 1,763 aircraft so far and countries such as Norway, Canada, Israel, Turkey and Singapore joining in. Announcing plans for Boeing's two \"concept demonstrator\" aircraft to begin test flights by the end of March, Frank Statkus, vice-president of Boeing's JSF programme, said UK firms would be guaranteed 20% of the eventual value of the contract. The UK government is contributing 10% of the development costs. Among those in Boeing's team are the avionics division of BAE Systems, once part of GEC-Marconi, Rolls-Royce, which is supplying hardware for the jump-jet version, Messier-Dowty, which is providing landing-gear, and other smaller firms. But BAE Systems also stands to gain if the rival team headed by Lockheed and embracing Northrop Grumman, makers of the B2 stealth bomber, wins the JSF contract. The contract is being awarded by the Pentagon and the ministry of defence, and a decision is likely within 18 months. Production of the plane would begin in 2004 and it would enter service in 2012. Industry sources said the plane was so technologically advanced and the programme so financially weighty that there may be a decision to split it between the rival teams. They said these two were running neck and neck in terms of controlling costs, with Mr Statkus claiming the programme was a model of affordability and the lowest risk Boeing had ever undertaken. \"This plane will give the free world the technological best of the best - and guarantee that freedom for 40 years,\" he said, at a London presentation. The aircraft were rolled out last month at a ceremony in California attended by employees, contractors and US defence officials. One has conventional take-off and landing capability, the other short take-off and vertical landing abilities for carrier use. Both can be built on the same production line because of common parts.

His departure cedes control to J\u00fcrgen Schrempp, his co-chairman, and eight fellow German directors on the 13-strong board where the Americans have lost power in what was billed as a merger of equals. Both companies refused to comment but Wall Street analysts said Mr Schrempp could use a Fiat merger to extend his group's range into smaller cars. \"They have been trying to formulate a small car strategy for some time,\" said one. Another Italian paper, Il Messagero, said there had been some opposition to the rumoured deal from Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman. The founding Agnelli family still owns about 33% of Fiat. Any takeover is likely to have political ramifications as Fiat contributes almost 5% of Italy's GDP. Its automotive division provides just half its annual sales. Other interests include agricultural and construction equipment, Iveco commercial vehicles and insurance.",

There's always something.</p> <p>And when the rain clears LA is at its most beautiful. You can stand on the top of Mount Hollywood in Griffith park and see a priceless 360-degree view - from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the snow-covered peak of Mount Baldy 60 miles inland - a view that' s hidden by smog for much of the year. It' s as if Travis Bickle's apocalyptic \"real rain\" has finally come down and \"swept all the scum off the streets\".</p> <p>Actually what' s really swept all the scum off the streets is the Sundance film festival. Oh, to be in Hollywood, when all of Hollywood' s in Park City, Utah. No wonder the air feels so crisp and clear and bracing. All the agents and producers are out of town. There's no one left in Los Angeles to shout at the waitresses.</p> <p>I was asked to go at the very last minute, but after a few calls I gladly declined. One LA film writer I know, someone who, to quote the sheriff of Malibu in The Big Lebowski, \"draws a lot of water in this town\", told me that she'd reserved her accommodations in Park City a year ago, and had made two dinner reservations last October - with a $60 minimum tab per person, food only, booze extra.</p> <p>Who needs that kind of gouging? The people you' ll be fighting with over Z-list tickets, vomit-flecked crash-pads, and scraps of overpriced food will be trust-funded film school grads who can't distinguish Satyajit Ray from Nicholas Ray or even Rudy Ray Moore. And they're all fighting for the attention of Hollywood's transplanted managerial class, who can't distinguish their cocaine from the snowdrift they just dropped it into.</p> <p>That song about the rain may be a lie, but it definitely never snows in southern California, so I gladly stayed home and went to the movies.</p> <p>There were only two minor roll-outs this weekend, the romantic comedy Down to You, and Ron Shelton's new boxing flick Play It to the Bone. One was rubbish, one wasn' t. Guess which one scored at the box office?</p> <p>That would be Down to You, one of those puppy-love movies that make you feel like you' re drowning slowly as you watch it. As each rottenly written scene grimly outstayed its welcome, my hand kept reaching out for the fast- forward button on an imaginary TV remote.</p> <p>It' s the story of how Al (Freddie Prinze Jr) and Imogen (Julia Stiles) meet cute, fall in love cute, fall out of love cute and fall back in cute. Writer-director Kris Isacsson defames and traduces both his job titles in fine style. His one-draft screenplay seems to have been written straight through without stopping or looking backwards.</p> <p>Of the two wan leads, Prinze has a certain charm but he' s cast adrift by Isacsson, and Julia Stiles meanwhile exercises both her facial expressions (brow furrowed, brow unfurrowed) to create a yawning hole of boredom where a performance should be. It made $7.6m and reached number two, but it was a smash-and-grab job. By next weekend the word of mouth will have killed it dead.</p> <p>Then there was Bone, starring Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas as two washed-up boxers, best friends, given a last shot at the big time - in a fight against each other. I love Shelton' s movies. Most of his male characters are buttheaded fools determined to throw away their talent, and his women are no-bullshit smokers and brawlers straight out of Howard Hawks, equally determined to save their men from themselves.</p> <p>The formula varies a little each time out, but the main attraction is Shelton' s exceptionally literate and witty dialogue, which has drawn comparisons with that of Preston Sturges and is usually salted with one or two unattributed lines from Walt Whitman and Keats.</p> <p>Even his longtime editor, Paul Seydor, just happens to be the best living writer on Sam Peckinpah' s movies, and Shelton himself also wrote the uncommonly sophisticated political drama Under Fire. Despite his track record - which includes Bull Durham and White Men Can' t Jump - Shelton was so sick of the studio film-making process that he made Bone independently, selling the script on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and filming in six weeks, with his stars taking salary cuts and Shelton' s fianc\u008ee, the two-fisted Lolita Davidovich, as the female lead. And all this despite the massive success of his last movie Tin Cup - a studio production. His reward? Play It to the Bone only scraped to number nine, with $3.4m.</p> <p>In an ideal world, it whould have been the other way round. But this is Hollywood, where the scum - like Down to You - always rises fastest, no matter how hard the rain may try to wash it away.</p>",

Writer-director Kris Isacsson defames and traduces both his job titles in fine style. His one-draft screenplay seems to have been written straight through without stopping or looking backwards. Of the two wan leads, Prinze has a certain charm but he' s cast adrift by Isacsson, and Julia Stiles meanwhile exercises both her facial expressions (brow furrowed, brow unfurrowed) to create a yawning hole of boredom where a performance should be. It made $7.6m and reached number two, but it was a smash-and-grab job. By next weekend the word of mouth will have killed it dead. Then there was Bone, starring Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas as two washed-up boxers, best friends, given a last shot at the big time - in a fight against each other. I love Shelton' s movies. Most of his male characters are buttheaded fools determined to throw away their talent, and his women are no-bullshit smokers and brawlers straight out of Howard Hawks, equally determined to save their men from themselves. The formula varies a little each time out, but the main attraction is Shelton' s exceptionally literate and witty dialogue, which has drawn comparisons with that of Preston Sturges and is usually salted with one or two unattributed lines from Walt Whitman and Keats. Even his longtime editor, Paul Seydor, just happens to be the best living writer on Sam Peckinpah' s movies, and Shelton himself also wrote the uncommonly sophisticated political drama Under Fire. Despite his track record - which includes Bull Durham and White Men Can' t Jump - Shelton was so sick of the studio film-making process that he made Bone independently, selling the script on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and filming in six weeks, with his stars taking salary cuts and Shelton' s fianc\u008ee, the two-fisted Lolita Davidovich, as the female lead. And all this despite the massive success of his last movie Tin Cup - a studio production. His reward? Play It to the Bone only scraped to number nine, with $3.4m. In an ideal world, it whould have been the other way round. But this is Hollywood, where the scum - like Down to You - always rises fastest, no matter how hard the rain may try to wash it away.",

      "body": "<p>The reputation of American Beauty, the cinematic debut of the young British stage director Sam Mendes, has compounded at an extraordinary, exponential rate since its US release. Initially regarded as a witty, literate ensemble piece to be cautiously compared to Ang Lee's Ice Storm, it has become a gigantic screen achievement, now arriving here hailed as the first bang-up classic of the new decade, garlanded with Golden Globes and soon (bet your shirt on it) Oscars. </p> <p>I felt it made a stunning impact at the London film festival in November and although it does not quite withstand the scrutiny of a second viewing, containing as it does elements of redundancy and naivety, it is certainly a film of incredible flair and formal, compositional brilliance. Mendes has assembled his actors like an extremely classy theatrical cast, and, with the help of Alan Ball's terrific screenplay, conjured from them superbly modulated complementary performances, crowned by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as the unhappiest middle-aged couple in all suburbia. </p> <p>Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged ad executive who hates his job and hates his life, whose wife and daughter loathe him, and for whom jerking off in the shower is the only pleasurable experience of the day. (At night, this indulgence is covertly extended to the matrimonial bed next to his sleeping wife.) </p> <p>His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is moody, mopey, grungey and secretly saving up for breast augmentation surgery, of which she has no obvious need, as Mendes later reveals in a scene in which Jane removes her top for the benefit of Ricky, the boy next door who is obsessed with filming her with his Sony DV camera. It is one of many erotic ironies in this picture, through which voyeurism is wilfully confused with rapture. </p> <p>But the real head-case is Carolyn, a failing real-estate saleswoman and Lester's uptight wife. This is an outstanding study in unhappiness from Annette Bening, who gives her best performance since The Grifters. Bening's bright, chipper keeping-up-appearances smile causes her crow's feet to crinkle and clench almost audibly. It is a mask of dysfunction and despair; and there is a compelling scene in which she fails to sell a tatty family home because of its inadequately tropical \"lagoon-style\" pool. After the contemptuous would-be buyers have left, she bursts into hysterical, self-loathing tears, while slapping herself across the face: \"Shut up! Shut up! You're weak!\" </p> <p>They all are. Peeping, wanking, sobbing and yearning, Mendes's characters and their weirdo neighbours drift through a bright suburban moonscape. This is the arena for their hidden lives, and secret, unacknowledged longings - erotic and otherwise - which manifest themselves outwardly in little jolts of disorientation and inattention, the suburban moment when, as Nabokov put it in Lolita, one accidentally sweeps the refrigerator and defrosts the driveway. </p> <p>But all this creepy serenity is blown away when Lester uproariously flowers into a liberating mid-life crisis. He quits his job; he smokes premium-quality dope bought from Ricky and conceives an obsession with Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's unbearably blonde and sexy best friend. </p> <p>All this is managed with magnificent confidence by Mendes, who shows an awe-inspiringly precocious mastery of technique, in part due to canny reliance on his veteran cinematographer Conrad L Hall. Opinion will divide on the dream-setpieces in American Beauty which - a bit artificially - amplify the roses of Carolyn's immaculate garden into the film's central poetic motif. As visionary enactments of erotic languour, they are stagey, pedantic, and a bit soft-core, but certainly entertaining and ingenious. </p> <p>American Beauty has its limits, and its flaws. As a journey into the troubled heart of American suburbia, it has nothing like the power and conviction of, say, Todd Solondz's Happiness or Alexander Payne's Election. Actually, there is a faint trace of saccharine here. When Ricky shows us an 11-minute video he has made of a plastic bag blowing in the wind, we are apparently invited to endorse his glassy-eyed assessment of it as a wonderful epiphany of natural beauty. So much beauty in the world, he says, that his heart almost collapses. </p> <p>Yet Ricky is, after all, supposed to be a drug dealer, who invites Jane to run away with him to New York City, where they will live on his earnings. This film makes that sound a sweetly romantic, almost bucolic existence. (I was reminded of a line in Doug Liman's underrated Go: \"Yeah, right, he's the good drug dealer...\") Moreover, there is a structural problem in the fact that a scene has been cut from the end, without which neither the pre-credit sequence, nor the denouement, really make satisfactory sense. </p> <p>But flaws and all, this is intelligent, exhilarating, effervescent film-making, and a remarkable debut from Sam Mendes for whom an Academy Award - along with prizes for Spacey and Bening - would now appear to be in order.</p>",

Bitter Sweet Symphony, by Shyama Perera (Sceptre, \u00a310) Buy it at BOL Forsaken lovers need to learn how to tell the difference between men and women. Women are like \"engineers\" who \"test and service the nuts and bolts\" of a relationship. Men, on the other hand, \"chuck them on the floor\". Just ask Nina - her husband, Buster, deserted her. Women must unite and \"pick ourselves off the floor and party\". Suggested revenge: Teach yourself \"woman power\" - drink vodka and forget about men. Bing Banged My Lula, by Frankie Park (Orion, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Four bitterly disillusioned single mums go on the lookout for \"potential shags\", but end up forming a band, falling in and out of love in typically disastrous fashion and indulging in some \"lesbian-relationship thing\" along the way. Men, it seems, are just love-rats - you are right to remain cynical about marriage. Suggested revenge: Pretend that you are \"strong and feisty\", even if you are really \"a weak, love-needy, dope-on-a-rope\". Amanda's Wedding, by Jenny Colgan (Harper Collins, \u00a35.99) Buy it at BOL Avoid rebound relationships - they invariably involve \"smelly, over-sized accountants with juvenile tendencies\". Far better to slander your \"selfish ex-boyfriend\" and sabotage all intended marriages in your vicinity. This is what the jilted Mel tries to do when she finds out that the social climber Amanda \"has got a Scottish aristocrat by the nuptials\". Suggested revenge: Rejoice in the company of mad friends and steer clear of accountants.",

      "body": "<p>Sterling would need to fall substantially from its 11-year-high on the foreign exchanges for hard-pressed manufacturers to cope with life inside monetary union, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. </p> <p>Despite supporting membership of monetary union in principle, the employers' organisation warned that it would be a mistake to lock the UK into the euro zone at the pound's current rate. </p> <p>\"This is not the appropriate level to join the euro,\" said Nick Reilly, managing director of Vauxhall and head of the CBI's economic affairs committee. He added that the CBI's support for the euro depended on the economic conditions being met. \"One of the conditions is that we have a competitive and appropriate exchange rate. Today's rate is not the right rate.\" </p> <p>Sterling is more than 50 pfennigs higher than the level of DM2.65 to DM2.70 deemed acceptable by CBI members last summer, and Mr Reilly said the \"abnormally high\" level of the pound was acting as a brake on recovery. </p> <p>Commenting on the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, Mr Reilly added: \"Exports are stabilising but this is being driven by a rise in world demand. The strength of sterling is still holding back firms as they battle to compete.\" </p> <p>The report showed demand in manufacturing rising for the first time in two years, with a pick-up in business optimism, healthier order books and rising output. But industry is still facing stiff competitive pressures, with jobs continuing to be shed in response to the squeeze on profit margins from falling prices. </p> <p>The CBI said that concern among firms that investment would fail to yield decent profits had reached record levels and was the main factor behind the weakness of spending on plant and machinery. \"Companies are having to run much harder to stand still,\" said Mr Reilly, urging the Bank of England to hold off from further interest rate increases. \"Many firms are hanging on by their fingertips and the two-speed economy remains very much in evidence.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sterling would need to fall substantially from its 11-year-high on the foreign exchanges for hard-pressed manufacturers to cope with life inside monetary union, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Despite supporting membership of monetary union in principle, the employers' organisation warned that it would be a mistake to lock the UK into the euro zone at the pound's current rate. \"This is not the appropriate level to join the euro,\" said Nick Reilly, managing director of Vauxhall and head of the CBI's economic affairs committee. He added that the CBI's support for the euro depended on the economic conditions being met. \"One of the conditions is that we have a competitive and appropriate exchange rate. Today's rate is not the right rate.\" Sterling is more than 50 pfennigs higher than the level of DM2.65 to DM2.70 deemed acceptable by CBI members last summer, and Mr Reilly said the \"abnormally high\" level of the pound was acting as a brake on recovery. Commenting on the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, Mr Reilly added: \"Exports are stabilising but this is being driven by a rise in world demand. The strength of sterling is still holding back firms as they battle to compete.\" The report showed demand in manufacturing rising for the first time in two years, with a pick-up in business optimism, healthier order books and rising output. But industry is still facing stiff competitive pressures, with jobs continuing to be shed in response to the squeeze on profit margins from falling prices. The CBI said that concern among firms that investment would fail to yield decent profits had reached record levels and was the main factor behind the weakness of spending on plant and machinery. \"Companies are having to run much harder to stand still,\" said Mr Reilly, urging the Bank of England to hold off from further interest rate increases. \"Many firms are hanging on by their fingertips and the two-speed economy remains very much in evidence.\"",

A report yesterday by Warburg Dillon Read, the stockbroker, forecast a threefold rise in European e-commerce by consumers and business by 2002 with a market possibly worth \"no less than a quarter of a trillion dollars\". Dutch bank ABN Amro said in a separate report that where the price pressures from online retailers \"spills over into traditional retail channels the implications will be potentially serious\". The report by Warburg suggest that European retailers have been slow to enter the internet race and are unlikely to gain a competitive edge in the long term over US operators. \"European retailer valuations have barely been affected by the internet, but we believe it is only a matter of time before online shopping has a significant impact,\" it says. The report's authors did not expect that \"e-tailers will condemn traditional retailers to extinction\". They claim that internet penetration equivalent to only 10% of Europe's population is where the US was three years ago. However, this still should be sufficient use of online trade to trigger greater investor interest, particularly from corporates. ABN Amro said that while traditional retailers could be hurt by e-tailers cutting prices, price would not be the whole story for consumers beginning to shop online. It argues that privacy and security considerations remained a deterrent from buying online as well as the lack of value added service. \"The impact on retailers, however, is likely to be negative in product categories which are wholly dependent on the manufacturer-brand and entirely product driven, electricals for example,\" the ABN Amro report said. \"The retailer struggles to add much value and the retail brand is not a differentiator.

Pauline Matthews, the equality commission's solicitor who took the case, said: \"This is a highly significant legal victory: discrimination arising after the end of employment is actionable and is now covered by the sex discrimination act.\" Julie Mellor, the chairwoman of the commission, said: \"It takes courage to fight cases like this over a long period of time and I warmly congratulate Belinda for her persistence. It also sends a clear message to employers, yet again, that equality pays and discrimination costs.\" In a statement, Granada Hospitality accepted mistakes had been made, and said it fully accepted the findings of the tribunal and apologised to Mrs Coote for the \"breakdown in procedures that led to this unfortunate situation\". It went on: \"Granada seeks to be one of the UK's responsible employers, and had led the way in implementing employment measures beyond the letter of the law particularly in equal opportunities. We have taken steps to ensure that mistakes made in this case never happen again.\" The GMB union, which also backed Mrs Coote's claim, commented that references were still vital in applying for jobs. \"Most companies ask for two or three. A good reference can be all-important,\" said a spokesman. \"Many potential employers want the word of another manager who has experience of the candidate, and see it [the reference] as a failsafe. \"If they don't get a reference or a previous employer refuses to supply one, it is assumed to be a sign that there has been a problem with the person.\"",

The subtitle - Alter Egos and Personal Obsessions - is even more eye-catchingly dramatic, though quite what this ballyhoo signifies is something of a mystery. The emphasis is seemingly on an impressive line-up of soloists performing works which hitherto haven't formed a notable part of their repertoires. </p> <p>The opening concert featured the Russian-born violinist Viktoria Mullova playing and directing two Mozart concertos. We used not to associate Mullova with Mozart. After this, one suspects, her name will be firmly linked to his. </p> <p>An uncompromising artist, bent on chiselling out the dramatic content of a work rather than indulging in glitzy virtuosity, Mullova is as alluring to watch as she is to hear. She swept on looking like some goddess of antiquity (Venus with a violin, perhaps) and proceeded to sculpt the phrases of the Third Concerto with a combination of seraphic radiance and humane beauty. The Third is an essentially operatic work in which the soloist spins out a succession of wordless arias, occasionally joining the orchestra in some wryly funny ensembles that pre-empt The Marriage of Figaro. In the slow movement, Mullova is an angelic diva and the long, tear-inducing melody seems disconnected from the earth, occasionally swooping down to touch it. </p> <p>In the Fourth Concerto, she's very different. It opens in territory which suggests imperial formality, its rigidity relentlessly undercut until the work ends in the Dionysian swirl of a jubilant waltz. Galvanising the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment into action with an imperious shrug of her shoulders, Mullova is more aggressive here, an Orphic figure whose playing seems to quell the orchestra into rapt submission. The opening flares upwards in a brief blaze of anger. The double-stopped cadenza of the slow movement is inherently bucolic, as if the violinist is finally warming up to lead that last great dance. Mullova is astonishing playing this music, and the orchestra are pretty damn fine, too. </p> <p>When Mullova was absent from the platform they were put through their paces by Catherine Mackintosh, directing from the leader's chair. Salieri's overture to La Scuola De' Gelosi burbled with pleasurable glee. Haydn's Passione Symphony is a work which rewrites almost every rule in the musical book in the course of its intense meditation on the Crucifixion. It's rarely been played with such searing density and tragic grandeur as it was on this occasion. </p>",

In the Fourth Concerto, she's very different. It opens in territory which suggests imperial formality, its rigidity relentlessly undercut until the work ends in the Dionysian swirl of a jubilant waltz. Galvanising the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment into action with an imperious shrug of her shoulders, Mullova is more aggressive here, an Orphic figure whose playing seems to quell the orchestra into rapt submission. The opening flares upwards in a brief blaze of anger. The double-stopped cadenza of the slow movement is inherently bucolic, as if the violinist is finally warming up to lead that last great dance. Mullova is astonishing playing this music, and the orchestra are pretty damn fine, too. When Mullova was absent from the platform they were put through their paces by Catherine Mackintosh, directing from the leader's chair. Salieri's overture to La Scuola De' Gelosi burbled with pleasurable glee. Haydn's Passione Symphony is a work which rewrites almost every rule in the musical book in the course of its intense meditation on the Crucifixion. It's rarely been played with such searing density and tragic grandeur as it was on this occasion.",
