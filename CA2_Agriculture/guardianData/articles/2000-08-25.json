Baronworth (Investment Services), based in Ilford, Essex, which has just published its latest with-profits bonds survey, offers investors enhancements of between 4.3% and 5.1% depending on how much is being invested.

If you get it right, you'll enjoy a one-year gross return of up to 60% - more than eight times higher than current best-buy savings rates of 6%-7%. If you get it wrong, you get your original investment back with no interest. </p> <p>It's just one of a spate of savings bonds launched over the last few days. </p> <p>Birmingham Midshires says the Speculator Bond, available from this coming Friday, is a \"first-of-its-kind\" investment that will deliver a one-year gross return of between 22% and 60% if your prediction comes true. Minimum investment is \u00a31,000, and you estimate the likely growth or decline of the FTSE 100 index over the 12 months between October 1 2000 and October 1 2001. </p> <p>If you correctly predict that the FTSE will fall by 10% or more over the period, you will earn a return of 25% gross - \u00a31,250 before tax, \u00a31,200 net if you put in \u00a31,000. If you correctly predict that the FTSE will fall, but by less than 10%, you will enjoy a return of 30% gross. </p> <p>The other predictions you can choose from, plus what you get if you guess correctly, are as follows: </p> <p>\u0095 FTSE remains static or grows by less than 10% - return of 22% gross; </p> <p>\u0095 FTSE grows by at least 10% but less than 20% - return of 22% gross; </p> <p>\u0095 FTSE grows by at least 20% but less than 30% - return of 30% gross; </p> <p>\u0095 FTSE grows by at least 30% - return of 60% gross. </p> <p>So to enjoy the biggest return, the market would have to make one hell of a leap. </p> <p>You can increase your chances of winning by spreading your money across two or more \"bands\". Birmingham Midshires admits that the bond would not be a suitable place for someone to put their life savings. It's a novel way of spicing up a savings portfolio that might appeal particularly to savers who are clued-up about the stock market. </p> <p>So what's likely to happen to the FTSE in the coming months? No one can say but looking back on past 12-month growth and decline trends for the FTSE 100 since 1986, these reveal that the most common occurrence has been for the FTSE to grow by between 10% and 20%. But this is no indicator of future performance. </p> <p>So what do the experts think? Ian Millward at Chase de Vere Investments, an independent financial adviser, likes the bond, describing it as \"a clever new product\" and \"a bit of fun\". But he adds: \"Your chances of getting it right are pretty slim. Trying to call the market over 12 months is really hard.\" </p> <p>This week also saw the launch of a new FTSE 100-linked savings bond from the Woolwich, offering a potential return of up to 40% of the original investment. But it involves tying your money up for five years and isn't offering particularly stunning value once you look closely. </p> <p>Between \u00a36,000 and \u00a3500,000 can be invested in the Woolwich's guaranteed equity bond. The investment starts on October 27 this year and matures on October 27 2005. </p> <p>At the end of the term you'll get a return based on the growth of the FTSE 100 over the period, up to a maximum of 40% of the original investment, so if you put in \u00a310,000, the most you can get back is \u00a314,000. If the index falls, you are guaranteed the return of your original investment. There are no set-up or management charges. </p> <p>However, a maximum return of 40% of the original investment is equivalent to compound interest of around 7% a year, which is \"not terribly exciting\", says Mr Millward. </p> <p>There are bank and building society instant-access-style accounts offering close to this - the Halifax's internet-operated Web Saver offers 6.35% from \u00a31, Legal &amp; General's Easy Access Tracker (phone and post account) currently pays 6.28% from \u00a31, and Bristol &amp; West's Clic Direct Easy Access account (also operated by phone and post) offers 6.85% from \u00a31,000, though this includes a 1% interest bonus until December 19 2000. </p> <p>Barclays has launched a stock market-linked savings bond which provides a return linked to the performance of the FTSE 100 or Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index over a three-and-a-half year term (from next October 12 to April 13, 2004), but it's an offshore product only open to non-UK residents. </p> <p>Fixed-rate savings bonds offered by banks and building societies are widely popular and Yorkshire building society unveiled a new one this week offering an interest rate of 6.60% gross per annum. You can choose a term of one or two years. </p> <p>This one is unusual in having a minimum investment of just \u00a3100 - with many fixed-rate bonds the minimum is \u00a31,000-plus. A monthly interest option is also available. This is a good rate but it's not the best around. Northern Rock is launching a fixed-rate bond offering 7.25% for one year gross.

But there are plenty of routes to holding down the cost. </p> <p>Switching insurers is the most obvious and, on average, saves around 20%-30% on your premium. As a starting point, log on to the internet and obtain a quote from an online broker such as <a href=\"http://www.screentrade.co.uk\">screentrade.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.egg.com\">egg.com</a>. Screentrade has a panel of 15 insurers, while Egg claims it will arrange a quote in just 10 seconds from its selection of nine insurers. Both promise to beat any renewal quotes from other insurers, and if they don't, will refund you the difference. </p> <p>If you are not on the net, a good alternative is a high street or telephone-based broker such as Hill House Hammond (0845-3000443) or the AA (0800-444777). </p> <p>One drawback to the on-line sites is that they tend not to include the giant telephone-based direct insurers such as Direct Line (020-8686-2468), Admiral (0800-600800) and Churchill (0800-200300), which may offer lower quotes. But as one of the first questions from the call centre operator is: \"What's the best quote you've got so far?\", the online quotes give you a benchmark they have to beat. </p> <p>The majority of insurers are standing firm on premium increases because they have incurred steep losses in recent years. But there are always new entrants, and others trying to increase market share, who are worth trying. Two currently in this bracket are Tesco (0845-3004400) and Co-op Insurance Services (08000-282929). </p> <p>The next cost-cutting step is to decide what level of cover you need, and how you can adjust it to reduce the premium. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Increase the excess.</strong> According to Hill House Hammond, doubling the voluntary excess (typically \u00a3100) can knock about 15% off the premium. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Reduce the number of drivers.</strong> \"Any driver\" policies have soared in cost. Restricting the number of drivers on your policy to just one other named driver can cut the premium by up to 30%. Adding teenagers to a policy is particularly expensive. Whereas premiums for over 60-year-olds are up by around 15% over the last year, premiums for under 25-year-olds have jumped by more than 50%. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Improve car security.</strong> Many insurers will lop 5% off a premium if the car has an insurer-approved alarm and immobiliser. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Change your car.</strong> Smaller, older cars cost far less to insure than newer, racier models. Car magazines list the insurance group cars fall into; a \u00a340,000 BMW Z3 is in group 19, a \u00a36,500 Fiat Seicento is in group 1. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Limit your mileage.</strong> If you can limit the amount you drive to under 5,000 miles a year, most insurers will cut premiums, some by as much as 15%. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Avoid unnecessary extras.</strong> For example, if you drive abroad, look for a policy that offers free European cover rather than an add-on. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Don't lie.</strong> The most common lie is to register cars outside London or the other high-rated metropolitan areas, either at parents or at fictitious addresses. Direct Line says doing so automatically invalidates your insurance. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Grow up.</strong> There is a remarkable drop in premiums after your 20s. Hill House Hammond says the average premium quote for someone under 25 is currently \u00a31,297.86. For someone aged 25-50 it is \u00a3455.01, while for over 50-year-olds the average is \u00a3448.66. </p> <p>Female under-25s obtain premium quotes which are about 20% less than males, but the picture reverses after that, with insurers charging older female drivers slightly more than older male drivers. So a sex-change op won't do much for your premiums, then. </p> <p> This week's scare over car insurance premiums was provoked by a report from consumer analysts Mintel; it says that premium increases in 1999 were 20% and will be a further 25% in 2000. </p> <p>\"At present, premium rises are doing little more than cover the increased cost of personal injury claims. The cost of motor repairs has also become a factor, with garage 'charge out' rates rising sharply and garages no longer prepared to depress labour rates to guarantee volume business,\" says the report. It estimates that even with a 25% increase this year, most insurers will not move into profit until 2002. </p> <p>However, Direct Line and others dispute the figures. Direct Line, while refusing to disclose its average premium rates, says that its increases will come in below 25%, while Tesco says: \"We don't expect our prices to rise by anything like 25%.\" </p> <p>CIS, meanwhile, says its premium increases were around 10% last year rather than 20%, and it expects to keep increases low again this year.</p>",

According to Hill House Hammond, doubling the voluntary excess (typically \u00a3100) can knock about 15% off the premium. \u0095 Reduce the number of drivers. \"Any driver\" policies have soared in cost. Restricting the number of drivers on your policy to just one other named driver can cut the premium by up to 30%. Adding teenagers to a policy is particularly expensive. Whereas premiums for over 60-year-olds are up by around 15% over the last year, premiums for under 25-year-olds have jumped by more than 50%. \u0095 Improve car security. Many insurers will lop 5% off a premium if the car has an insurer-approved alarm and immobiliser. \u0095 Change your car. Smaller, older cars cost far less to insure than newer, racier models. Car magazines list the insurance group cars fall into; a \u00a340,000 BMW Z3 is in group 19, a \u00a36,500 Fiat Seicento is in group 1. \u0095 Limit your mileage. If you can limit the amount you drive to under 5,000 miles a year, most insurers will cut premiums, some by as much as 15%. \u0095 Avoid unnecessary extras. For example, if you drive abroad, look for a policy that offers free European cover rather than an add-on. \u0095 Don't lie. The most common lie is to register cars outside London or the other high-rated metropolitan areas, either at parents or at fictitious addresses. Direct Line says doing so automatically invalidates your insurance. \u0095 Grow up. There is a remarkable drop in premiums after your 20s. Hill House Hammond says the average premium quote for someone under 25 is currently \u00a31,297.86. For someone aged 25-50 it is \u00a3455.01, while for over 50-year-olds the average is \u00a3448.66. Female under-25s obtain premium quotes which are about 20% less than males, but the picture reverses after that, with insurers charging older female drivers slightly more than older male drivers. So a sex-change op won't do much for your premiums, then. This week's scare over car insurance premiums was provoked by a report from consumer analysts Mintel; it says that premium increases in 1999 were 20% and will be a further 25% in 2000. \"At present, premium rises are doing little more than cover the increased cost of personal injury claims. The cost of motor repairs has also become a factor, with garage 'charge out' rates rising sharply and garages no longer prepared to depress labour rates to guarantee volume business,\" says the report. It estimates that even with a 25% increase this year, most insurers will not move into profit until 2002. However, Direct Line and others dispute the figures. Direct Line, while refusing to disclose its average premium rates, says that its increases will come in below 25%, while Tesco says: \"We don't expect our prices to rise by anything like 25%.\" CIS, meanwhile, says its premium increases were around 10% last year rather than 20%, and it expects to keep increases low again this year.",

Longhurst told managers: \"In recent years you have been urged to lend as much as you can, but you have never been urged to lend on rubbish or to rubbish.\" </p> <p>He called for \"a more careful consideration of each and every new mortgage application\". C&amp;G made major changes in the way it deals with repossession properties in 1994. It says: \"Our policy is to obtain the best possible sales price. We obtain two professional valuations and a selling agent's appraisal and set an initial asking price based on their average. </p> <p>\"Selling agents are instructed <strong> not</strong> to advertise the property as a repossession as this could be in conflict with our duty of care to obtain the best price. </p> <p>\"Once an offer is accepted, we advertise the property in a local newspaper in case there are higher bids and our agents continue to market the property until contracts are exchanged. We sell 95% of repossessions through estate agents rather than auctions. But even in auctions, we set a reserve price based on our valuations.\" </p> <p>The C&amp;G was not alone in less-than-totally prudent lending in the 80s. Abbey National lent \u00a374,500 in the late 80s to a customer earning around \u00a311,000 a year - nearly seven times his annual income instead of the more normal three times. </p> <p>Terry Harborne, now 33, set up a cleaning company employing 60 part-timers in 1989. One of his contracts was to clean the Abbey National branch in West Ealing, London. </p> <p>Staff there discovered that Terry was paying \u00a3400 a month in rent. They told him this could fund a \u00a375,000 mortgage. \"I just did what they said. As I was self-employed, I should have had three years' audited accounts but they ignored that. They did the whole thing on my VAT registration and the VAT threshold was then \u00a325,000.\" </p> <p>But Abbey's staff misunderstood how VAT worked. The \u00a325,000 figure is turnover, not profit - his annual earnings were \u00a311,000. </p> <p>Harborne only lived in his \u00a374,500 Wandsworth, London house for a month. \"I gave back the keys. I was blacklisted for credit - I couldn't even get a bank account.\" </p> <p>In 1997, the Abbey sent him a bill for \u00a345,036, but after Harborne advertised his plight on his own website, Abbey settled for \u00a33,500. </p> <p>Recently, some mortgage brokers and lenders have been offering up to five times salary - rather than the more prudent 3.25 times as borrowers geared up to meet fast rising property prices. And this has led to fears that repossessions and shortfalls could all happen again to a new generation of borrowers.</p> <p><strong>Repossessed: The college lecturer </strong> <br></p> <p>The Archaeology lecturer Eleanor Scott paid \u00a318,500 for a Newcastle flat in 1991. When it was sold as a repossession, it fetched just \u00a31,300.

Two years later, on leaving the property, she realised prices had fallen, but N &amp; P would not allow her to sell privately at a loss as this would deprive it of a claim under its mortgage indemnity guarantee policy. </p> <p>She failed in an attempt to rent the property - and being in a less desirable area of Newcastle, it was damaged by substantial vandalism while it stood empty. </p> <p>In 1995, the N &amp; P wrote to her - several months after she had contacted them - with a Voluntary Possession Form. The lender assured her it \"would start to actively market the property to obtain the best market value advised by two independent estate agents.\" </p> <p>When sold at auction the flat fetched just \u00a31,300.

For example, jamjar says that it is averaging savings of \u00a3850, and adds that if we all bought our new X-reg cars from it this September then the great British car buying public would save \u00a3300m in one month alone. </p> <p>It all sounds terribly impressive, as does jamjar's statement that in just over a month's online trading it has delivered almost 100 cars, with another 500 or so on order. </p> <p>But look harder and something doesn't quite add up, because jamjar has been advertising extensively on television - with those irritating little \"models\" - and yet it has still only sold 100 cars, which is a vanishing fraction of the annual total of around 2m new car registrations. </p> <p>And jamjar's case isn't helped by the fact that its savings claims are made against the manufacturer's recommended retail prices (RRPs), which as the motor trade never ceases to remind us, are almost always rather higher than the price you'll actually pay anyway. </p> <p>So, if you're out buying a new car in the next couple of weeks you need to be aware of the reason why everyone isn't already buying online - and fundamentally it's because the price you pay for your new car is only half the financial story. </p> <p>After all, most of us have a car to sell when we go looking for a new one, so what really matters is the \"transaction cost\" or \"cost to change\" - which, of course, is the difference between the price of your new car and what you get for the old one. </p> <p>The financial implication of all this is obvious enough: because an apparently cheap new car will become altogether more expensive if you get a low offer for your old one. </p> <p>So might uncompetitive transaction costs be the reason why we aren't buying all our new motors over the web? </p> <p>As an entirely unscientific test, I decided to see what it would cost me to change my 1997 P Citroen Xantia 1.8 16v with 40,000 miles for a shiny new Ford Mondeo 1.8LX. </p> <p>Jamjar will sell me the new Ford for a very tempting sounding \u00a311,561, while their offer for my old car was \u00a33,610 - giving me a net cost to change of \u00a37,951. (And incidentally that was for a UK-sourced car, which I could have as soon as I wanted it.) </p> <p>So, could a Ford dealer do better? I called a local dealer and was told they would give me \"about \u00a34,000\" for the Citroen, while my new Mondeo would cost \u00a312,500. That meant a cost to change which was more than \u00a3500 worse than jamjar's. </p> <p>I then asked if there'd be some haggling room, and was told that I'd \"very probably\" be able to get the cost to change down from that \u00a38,500 first offer.

And jamjar's case isn't helped by the fact that its savings claims are made against the manufacturer's recommended retail prices (RRPs), which as the motor trade never ceases to remind us, are almost always rather higher than the price you'll actually pay anyway. So, if you're out buying a new car in the next couple of weeks you need to be aware of the reason why everyone isn't already buying online - and fundamentally it's because the price you pay for your new car is only half the financial story. After all, most of us have a car to sell when we go looking for a new one, so what really matters is the \"transaction cost\" or \"cost to change\" - which, of course, is the difference between the price of your new car and what you get for the old one. The financial implication of all this is obvious enough: because an apparently cheap new car will become altogether more expensive if you get a low offer for your old one. So might uncompetitive transaction costs be the reason why we aren't buying all our new motors over the web? As an entirely unscientific test, I decided to see what it would cost me to change my 1997 P Citroen Xantia 1.8 16v with 40,000 miles for a shiny new Ford Mondeo 1.8LX.

That meant a cost to change which was more than \u00a3500 worse than jamjar's. I then asked if there'd be some haggling room, and was told that I'd \"very probably\" be able to get the cost to change down from that \u00a38,500 first offer. However, the beauty of jamjar is that it's hassle - and haggle - free. Had jamjar won the day outright? Not quite, because these days many of the big car supermarkets are also selling new cars.

It's hardly a scientific test I'll grant you, but my ring-around helps to make the point that heavily promoted and strongly branded websites aren't necessarily the cheapest source of new cars. And that's hardly surprising when you realise that those of them who do offer a complete service, as jamjar does, rely on the established motor trade to deal with their part exchange cars, and to sort out those all-important test drives too. In jamjar's case, that motor trade partner is Dixon Motors plc, and it's quite hard to see how jamjar can achieve really low transaction costs when it's effectively adding a whole tier of marketing costs on to an established dealer distribution network. But let's not be too hard on jamjar, because I find that many of the other new car websites are less than enthusiastic about taking old cars in part-exchange at all, while to its credit jamjar have worked hard to make the process simple and customer-friendly. So, the best advice is to shop widely this September, both on and offline, and if you've got an old car to sell or part-exchange, then never lose sight of that cost to change figure. Because in the end it's the one figure which will tell you for certain that you've done a really good deal. And that applies whether you're buying over the internet or from the dealer round the corner.",

The decision will make it harder for pension and life assurance companies to escape liability when they do get things wrong. </p> <p>Lesley Gorham's husband was sold a pension by Standard Life in January 1992.

When Standard Life reviewed his pension in November 1992, it realised the mistake and advised him to switch to the BT scheme.

In court, Standard Life accepted that the advice it had given was negligent and that it had had a duty not to sell him one of its pensions.

      "body": "<p>Alan Shearer's retirement from international football could mark the renaissance of Andy Cole's faltering England career. The friendly against France in Paris tomorrow week may well give the 28-year-old Manchester United striker an opportunity to prove to Kevin Keegan that he is ready to take over from Shearer in the attack for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. </p> <p> Cole was left out of Keegan's squad for this summer's European championship after telling the England coach that he doubted his fitness and wanted to be ready for the new season with United. \"There are still a few who can't believe that but I keep saying it because it's the truth,\" Keegan stressed yesterday when he announced the squad for the encounter with the world and European champions. </p> <p> Now, with Cole fully fit and showing good early-season form at Old Trafford, Keegan gave every sign that he would recall him to the side against France in the hope of finding a successful goalscoring combination for the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland early in October. </p> <p> \"He deserves to have a chance,\" the coach said. \"He was an outstanding 23-year-old when I had him at Newcastle but at 28 he's in his prime.\" </p> <p> The alternative would seem to be Liverpool's Emile Heskey, still in credit with Keegan after his impressive performance in the goalless friendly against Argentina in February. Keegan's problem, however, is that memories of what might have looked promising before Euro 2000 were quickly buried by England's failures once they got there and their early return home after defeats by Portugal and Romania. </p> <p> The squad against France, which will form the basis of the teams that will face the Germans and the Finns, confirms England's present limitations, for all the coach's continued insistence that the quality is there. </p> <p> Shearer (retired), Robbie Fowler (unfit) and Richard Wright, dropped as third-choice goalkeeper in favour of David James, are missing from the squad of 22 picked for Euro 2000. </p> <p>Cole, Kieron Dyer, James and Rio Ferdinand have been recalled, along with Darren Anderton, another who announced that he wanted to spend the summer getting himself fully fit. </p> <p> Tony Adams will, as Keegan had intimated, take over the captaincy from Shearer in spite of reservations about his fitness after only one appearance in Euro 2000. </p> <p> \"Tony Adams is the most natural person to take over from Alan,\" Keegan said yesterday. \"His leadership qualities are there for all to see. People respect him.

      "bodyText": "Alan Shearer's retirement from international football could mark the renaissance of Andy Cole's faltering England career. The friendly against France in Paris tomorrow week may well give the 28-year-old Manchester United striker an opportunity to prove to Kevin Keegan that he is ready to take over from Shearer in the attack for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. Cole was left out of Keegan's squad for this summer's European championship after telling the England coach that he doubted his fitness and wanted to be ready for the new season with United. \"There are still a few who can't believe that but I keep saying it because it's the truth,\" Keegan stressed yesterday when he announced the squad for the encounter with the world and European champions. Now, with Cole fully fit and showing good early-season form at Old Trafford, Keegan gave every sign that he would recall him to the side against France in the hope of finding a successful goalscoring combination for the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland early in October. \"He deserves to have a chance,\" the coach said. \"He was an outstanding 23-year-old when I had him at Newcastle but at 28 he's in his prime.\" The alternative would seem to be Liverpool's Emile Heskey, still in credit with Keegan after his impressive performance in the goalless friendly against Argentina in February. Keegan's problem, however, is that memories of what might have looked promising before Euro 2000 were quickly buried by England's failures once they got there and their early return home after defeats by Portugal and Romania. The squad against France, which will form the basis of the teams that will face the Germans and the Finns, confirms England's present limitations, for all the coach's continued insistence that the quality is there. Shearer (retired), Robbie Fowler (unfit) and Richard Wright, dropped as third-choice goalkeeper in favour of David James, are missing from the squad of 22 picked for Euro 2000. Cole, Kieron Dyer, James and Rio Ferdinand have been recalled, along with Darren Anderton, another who announced that he wanted to spend the summer getting himself fully fit. Tony Adams will, as Keegan had intimated, take over the captaincy from Shearer in spite of reservations about his fitness after only one appearance in Euro 2000. \"Tony Adams is the most natural person to take over from Alan,\" Keegan said yesterday. \"His leadership qualities are there for all to see. People respect him. But it may be short-term and we have to be prepared for that.\" Steven Gerrard, the 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder who played impressively against Germany in Charleroi, is another likely starter in Paris and Keegan also hinted that he might use Steve McManaman as a substitute even though the Real Madrid man is short of match practice. With Dyer and Rio Ferdinand available, England look a little better equipped to produce the quality of passing and movement so badly lacking during Euro 2000. But when Keegan yet again talks fondly of recalling the 38-year-old Stuart Pearce, it is clear that in certain positions his options are still severely limited. \u0095 Seven players from the English Premiership are included in France's 22-man squad - unchanged from Euro 2000 - for the friendly. The match will be the central defender Laurent Blanc's last for his country. Goalkeepers: Barthez (Manchester United), Lama (Rennes), Rame (Bordeaux). Defenders: Blanc (Internazionale), Candela (Roma), Desailly (Chelsea), Leboeuf (Chelsea), Lizarazu (Bayern Munich), Thuram (Parma). Midfielders: Deschamps (Valencia), Djorkaeff (Kaiserslautern), Karembeu (Middlesbrough), Micoud (Parma), Petit (Barcelona), Vieira (Arsenal), Zidane (Juventus).

Celtic won this affair with a thumping aggregate score and via some abrupt shrapnel from Mark Burchill, who surely scored one of the quickest hat-tricks in British football. </p> <p>It has been a misleading week for the Old Firm. Rangers on Wednesday dusted off the challenge of Herfolge in the Champions League and Celtic treated poor Jeunesse from Luxembourg with all the respect of a tossed salad in this Uefa Cup qualifying tie. </p> <p>To add to their 4-0 lead from the first leg Celtic, who have confirmed the appointment of John Robertson as assistant manager, had already grabbed four by the 20th minute here, though the tedium of watching this match was at least relieved by a couple of maverick elements. Starting only his second competitive match for the club since arriving for \u00a35m from Brazil last season was Rafael. Martin O'Neill has been reluctant to deploy this expensive mistake thus far, and last night we had a hunch as to why. </p> <p>Rafael is a remnant from the derided John Barnes era at Celtic, as is Bobby Petta who is in danger these days of becoming a darling among the Celtic faithful. Petta drew more cheers for his slaloming runs last night, but it isn't mere fluke that his one truly mesmerising performance came in the first leg against Jeunesse. </p> <p>One player who is talented, and currently demanding a transfer from Celtic, is Burchill, whose quickfire hat-trick was reminiscent of the mayhem of Jimmy McGrory in the late 1940s. Between the 12th and 15th minutes Burchill sent a bullet header and a couple of swift prods past John van Rijswick, the Jeunesse goalkeeper who must have felt victimised. Even before the first half was out, Celtic had a fourth through Eyal Berkovic. </p> <p>The rout was completed through a further goal from Berkovic as well as strikes by Vidar Riseth and Stillian Petrov in the second half. </p> <p>\u0095 With Bohemians of Dublin holding Aberdeen to a single goal, Hearts were the only other Scottish or Welsh survivors, defeating IBV Vestmannyjar of Iceland 5-0 on aggregate thanks to strikes by Gary McSwegan, Robert Tomaschek and Kris O'Neil. </p> <p> <strong> Celtic </strong> (3-5-2): Gould; Tebily, Riseth, Scheidt; Healy, Lambert (Miller, h-t), Mjallby, Berkovic, Petta; Burchill (Boyd, h-t), Lynch (Petrov, 61). </p> <p><strong> Jeunesse Esch </strong> (4-4-2): Van Rijswick; Schaack, Wagner, Schauls, Lamborelle; Sabotic, Borbiconi, Meylender, Kurtz (Neis, 65); Betis, Anodio. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> P Leuba (Switz).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Coasting in football does not come easier than this. Celtic won this affair with a thumping aggregate score and via some abrupt shrapnel from Mark Burchill, who surely scored one of the quickest hat-tricks in British football. It has been a misleading week for the Old Firm. Rangers on Wednesday dusted off the challenge of Herfolge in the Champions League and Celtic treated poor Jeunesse from Luxembourg with all the respect of a tossed salad in this Uefa Cup qualifying tie. To add to their 4-0 lead from the first leg Celtic, who have confirmed the appointment of John Robertson as assistant manager, had already grabbed four by the 20th minute here, though the tedium of watching this match was at least relieved by a couple of maverick elements. Starting only his second competitive match for the club since arriving for \u00a35m from Brazil last season was Rafael. Martin O'Neill has been reluctant to deploy this expensive mistake thus far, and last night we had a hunch as to why. Rafael is a remnant from the derided John Barnes era at Celtic, as is Bobby Petta who is in danger these days of becoming a darling among the Celtic faithful. Petta drew more cheers for his slaloming runs last night, but it isn't mere fluke that his one truly mesmerising performance came in the first leg against Jeunesse. One player who is talented, and currently demanding a transfer from Celtic, is Burchill, whose quickfire hat-trick was reminiscent of the mayhem of Jimmy McGrory in the late 1940s. Between the 12th and 15th minutes Burchill sent a bullet header and a couple of swift prods past John van Rijswick, the Jeunesse goalkeeper who must have felt victimised. Even before the first half was out, Celtic had a fourth through Eyal Berkovic. The rout was completed through a further goal from Berkovic as well as strikes by Vidar Riseth and Stillian Petrov in the second half. \u0095 With Bohemians of Dublin holding Aberdeen to a single goal, Hearts were the only other Scottish or Welsh survivors, defeating IBV Vestmannyjar of Iceland 5-0 on aggregate thanks to strikes by Gary McSwegan, Robert Tomaschek and Kris O'Neil. Celtic (3-5-2): Gould; Tebily, Riseth, Scheidt; Healy, Lambert (Miller, h-t), Mjallby, Berkovic, Petta; Burchill (Boyd, h-t), Lynch (Petrov, 61). Jeunesse Esch (4-4-2): Van Rijswick; Schaack, Wagner, Schauls, Lamborelle; Sabotic, Borbiconi, Meylender, Kurtz (Neis, 65); Betis, Anodio. Referee: P Leuba (Switz).",

Today TRIANGULAR TOURNAMENT Singapore: South Africa v New Zealand (02.45; one day). \u0095 There are changes in the way bonus points are earned in the millennial revision of the County Championship. As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt) 250-299 (2pts) 300-349 (3pts) 350-399 (4pts) 400 or over (5pts) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4 last year) Three-five wickets (1pt) Six-eight wickets (2pts) Nine-10 wickets (3pts) The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *In a draw where the scores finish level, the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.",

      "bodyText": "A leading loyalist shot dead in Belfast was given a full paramilitary funeral amid tight security today. Huge crowds turned out for the burial of Jackie Coulter, who was gunned down along with Bobby Mahood on Monday amid bitter loyalist feuding. One of the chief mourners was John White, chairman of the Ulster Democratic Party, which represents the Ulster Freedom Fighters. He said he had appealed to the UFF to talk to its enemies but that his plea had, so far, fallen on deaf ears. \"I have been trying to encourage dialogue but I have been told there is no room for dialogue.\" Mr White is a close associate of UFF boss, Johnny Adair, sent back to prison on Tuesday on the orders of Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson. Police and troops lined the funeral route, blocking off side roads as the coffin with carried from his home in the Shankill Road area. Mr Coulter's wife Agnes, son and three daughters walked behind the coffin. The cortege stopped briefly on the spot in the Crumlin Road where Mr Coulter and Mr Mahood were shot dead by a lone Ulster Volunteer Force gunman at the beginning of the week. More than 1,000 men marched slowly behind the coffin and youths in white shirts and black ties carried floral tributes at the head of the procession. The coffin was then put into a hearse which drove down the Shankill Road and across the city to Roselawn Cemetery. During the service a wreath from the Loyalist Volunteer Force was delivered by a group of men. Marshals with black arm bands and walkie talkies controlled the crowd and kept cameramen well back. Security around the Shankill will remain tight in the days ahead as security chiefs fear the continuation of the loyalist feud between the Ulster Defence Association , the UFF and Ulster Volunteer Force. A man with links to the UVF - shot dead on Wednesday night in retaliation for the murder of Mr Coulter and Mr Mahood - will be buried tomorrow. Security chiefs are concerned there could be yet more bloodletting following the funerals. Meanwhile, six men arrested after a chase in the Shankill Road area during which six weapons were found today remained in police custody.",

      "body": "<p>\"Let me start by saying how pleased I was to be asked to deliver the MacTaggart lecture in this the 25th year of the Edinburgh International Television Festival. </p> <p> I wasn't here for the first few years but I have been coming on and off for most of the Festival's existence. </p> <p> Three things have changed fundamentally since those early days. Firstly the size and professionalism of the festival has changed beyond recognition. </p> <p> Secondly the price of hotels in Edinburgh for this particular weekend have gone through the roof. </p> <p> Finally, and the biggest change of all, my friend Gus MacDonald has gone from being a radical programme maker with strong far left credentials to become Lord MacDonald of Tradeston. </p> <p> Gus, 25 years ago the only thing less likely than me becoming Director-General of the BBC was you agreeing to become a member of the House of Lords. </p> <p> Actually I'm the first ever Director-General never to have worked for the BBC before taking on the role. I only ever applied for two jobs at the BBC - the first in 1970 as a reporter on Radio Teeside, which I failed to get, and the second nearly 30 years later as Director-General. </p> <p> I am also flattered to be the first person ever to deliver the MacTaggart lecture twice, although there is one big drawback to that. I used all my best jokes the first time. So forgive me if my lecture here tonight is unremittingly serious and I realise that as a result, some will think that I've gone completely native after less than a year at the BBC. </p> <p> In 1994, my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between Government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the Government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the Government of the day. </p> <p> I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from Government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the Government's decision to give the BBC a seven year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC Charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. </p> <p> However we all still need to be vigilant in the area of political independence and I am particularly concerned when I read of proposals for a single content regulator across the whole television industry. </p> <p> I believe we have a far better chance of resisting political pressure if, between us, we have more than one content regulator. Pluralism in regulation is as important as pluralism among broadcasters. </p> <p> But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. </p> <p> The Council Chamber in Broadcasting House at the BBC is an austere place where the windows are set so high that no one can see in or out. If you believe that is symbolic, beware - our new boardroom has no windows at all. </p> <p> As you go into the Council Chamber you will find something equally symbolic - the portraits of previous Directors-General hang on the walls around you to serve as a constant reminder of the BBC's heritage. </p> <p> In the spot above the mantelpiece, pride of place rightly goes to the BBC's founder, John Reith. The second best spot, directly opposite him, is taken by Hugh Carleton Greene. These are seen by many as the two truly great Directors-General. </p> <p> Now, the myth of the BBC is that there is a single flame, a single idea handed seamlessly from generation to generation. The flame is public service broadcasting and each generation understands its inheritance and fights not to change it but to defend it to the death. Having the previous Directors-General looking down upon you is no doubt intended to remind you that you tamper with it at your peril. </p> <p><strong>Echoes of the past</strong></p> <p> The truth, of course, is very different. John Reith - on your right as you walk into the Council Chamber - ended up disliking Greene, on the left, with an intense passion. Reith's view was that Greene had trivialised his great institution; that Greene had - dare I use the words - \"dumbed down\" the BBC. As Reith put it when talking about Greene, \"I lead, he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age\u00bf Without any reservation he gives the public what it wants; I would not, did not and said I wouldn't. I am very annoyed that I even got on to terms with him\". </p> <p> In fact, many of the changes attributed to Greene had actually been started by his predecessor Sir Ian Jacob. Reith's views of Jacob were similar to his views of Greene. When he heard Jacob's portrait was going to be hung in the Council Chamber, Reith was so angry that he demanded that his own portrait be removed. </p> <p> What had Jacob and Greene actually done to so upset the BBC's founder? The story is very illuminating. </p> <p> Under Jacob, Greene had been Director of News and Current Affairs and had set about introducing radical change. </p> <p> In the mid-fifties the great joke about BBC News was that every newsreel would begin, \"The Queen Mother yesterday\u00bf\". I do, of course, realise that I am on dangerous ground when talking of the Queen Mother, but I'll take the risk. </p> <p> Back to the joke. All newsreels started \"The Queen Mother yesterday\". The Queen Mother because everyone loved the Queen Mother; and yesterday because it took the BBC at least a day to check with the Queen Mother that she had done what she was said to have done, even though they had film of her doing it. </p> <p> Greene set about changing the whole journalistic ethos of the BBC, transforming a largely obsequious and deferential institution into a gritty news organisation that could respond swiftly and imaginatively. At the heart of the changes were two extremely controversial views, though: firstly that television not newspapers would prove to be the bedrock of news reporting in the future; and secondly that news and current affairs had to be less isolated from the rest of the BBC.</p> <p><strong>ITV on the scene</strong></p> <p> It was out of these twin beliefs that truly ground-breaking genre-defying programmes like Cathy Come Home were later to spring. </p> <p> After two years running News and Current Affairs, Greene became Director-General in 1960 at a time of real turmoil in the industry. Interestingly on becoming Director-General one of Greene's first actions was to move the nine o'clock news on the old Home Service, now Radio Four, to ten o'clock. You will not be surprised to know that the decision was ferociously attacked at the time. </p> <p> By 1960 BBC Television was in real trouble. ITV had come into existence in 1954 and after a difficult start was making life very hard for the BBC. BBC Television's share had gone from 100% to 34% in only six years, and remember this was still only a two channel world. </p> <p> With quiz programmes like Double Your Money, Take Your Pick and a raft of popular American series, ITV was stealing the hearts and minds of British viewers. Meanwhile BBC Television, obsessed with its own importance, was inward looking and hardly seemed to notice what was going on. </p> <p> Jacob and Greene set about changing this. For the first time British audiences were to be offered a diet of programming that was both challenging and popular, programmes like Play for Today, Z Cars, The Forsyte Saga, That Was the Week That Was, Til Death Us Do Part, Doctor Who, Monty Python's Flying Circus and literally dozens of others. </p> <p> It wasn't that Greene produced these programmes, of course he didn't. But he did make them possible. He gave BBC producers the ambition to make popular quality programming for the first time - programmes which both appealed to large audiences and made a difference to their lives. In rating terms, the BBC made a great recovery which left ITV with no option but to follow the BBC's lead, effectively making Greene the founder of modern day British television. </p> <p><strong>Radio reforms</strong></p> <p> And it didn't end with television either. When Radio Caroline and other pirate stations started broadcasting under a Panamanian flag of convenience in 1964 he not only argued that they should be closed down, but along with Frank Gillard, his legendary head of radio, he put in place the now familiar pattern of Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. Imagine the fuss that caused. </p> <p> Greene and Gillard's reforms of radio and television brought cries of derision. A Times leader accused the BBC of \"abandoning their role as the sponsors and protectors of quality broadcasting\". </p> <p> Even the now seemingly innocuous Z Cars received its fair share of condemnation. The Chief Constable of Lancashire, Colonel Eric St Johnstone, demanded that it be cancelled. His force, to a man, he complained, were full of disgust. </p> <p> Mary Whitehouse complained about the spate of modern plays on the BBC: \"We are told that the dramatists are portraying real life, but why concentrate on the kitchen sink when there are so many pleasant sitting rooms?\" No wonder she said of Greene: \"If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies, I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carleton Greene.\" </p> <p> Outrage from journalists, politicians, the great and the good and even some of the BBC's own staff at any mooted change in BBC radio or television is a pattern you can find throughout the history of the BBC. </p> <p> Just look at the last decade - changes within all of our memories. Remember the fuss and outrage when Matthew Bannister re-shaped and effectively re-invented Radio 1 in the mid Nineties? Yet Radio 1 is now seen as one of the great success stories of the BBC. </p> <p> Remember the fuss when the BBC created Radio Five Live with the idea of starting a radio station aimed at a younger audience and based around news and sport? Today Five Live is supreme in its field and its audience is still growing rapidly year by year. </p> <p> Remember when John Birt set up BBC Online? He was widely accused of wasting licence payers' money and yet now it is the most visited content site in Europe and widely loved by some of the very people who accused him of wasting money at the time. </p> <p><strong>Populism</strong></p> <p> Long before any of these recent examples, a few of you may remember Grace Archer's death in the Archers - which just happened to coincide with the opening night of ITV. It was greeted by Denis Pitts in the Daily Herald with the following denunciation: \"The BBC went too far on Thursday when, for the sake of a stunt, they killed off Grace Archer. The stunt was mean, callous and cold-blooded. I accuse the BBC of a shabby trick which has left an unpleasant taste in nine million mouths. I am angry. So is my wife.\" </p> <p> You have to wonder what his wife would have thought about EastEnders. </p> <p> In the sixties the opponents of change and in particular Greene's style of populism were everywhere. We now see Steptoe and Son as the great turning point in British situation comedy, a seminal series which helped pave the way for Dad's Army, 'Til Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and many others. But it wasn't always perceived as that. </p> <p> Wilfrid Brambell - the Shakespearean actor who played Steptoe senior said at the time: \"I suppose every actor has to get into dustbin drama sooner or later\". </p> <p> One wonders if anyone today would ever have heard of Brambell if he hadn't got into \"dustbin drama\" - I rather doubt it. </p> <p> None of this is new. As the BBC's Chief Archivist described it to me, \"The BBC has been accused of dumbing down from the day Reith invented it.\" Propose any significant change and the BBC is accused of betraying its heritage. </p> <p> The point is that the real genius of the BBC is that it has adapted and changed over the years. Successive generations of leaders have not simply taken the flame of public service broadcasting as a whole and passed it on unchanged. At crucial times in the BBC's history they have recognised that change was essential and have taken the bold decision to introduce it despite loud protests from all around them. </p> <p> By and large history has rewarded their courage and their detractors have been forgotten. No Director-General was more criticised than Greene and yet today his memory is revered - without Greene there would not be the BBC as we know it. Reith invented the BBC for one age. Greene re-invented it for another. </p> <p> <strong>John Birt </strong></p> <p> Of course it's pretty obvious why there are so many howls when anyone wants to change even comparatively small parts of the BBC. </p> <p> It was Machiavelli, when writing The Prince, who summed it up when he wrote: \"There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. </p> <p> \"For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who would gain by the new.\" </p> <p> Oddly when I looked up that quote in my files written on the same sheet was one which is less philosophical but equally applicable. It was from the former French President General De Gaulle who said, \"Never stand between the dog and the lamp post.\" </p> <p> So given this history, why try to change the BBC? </p> <p> Look at the venom directed at John Birt - the man who had the courage to start the modernisation process at the BBC. </p> <p> Why be radical in an age when attacks from sections of the press are more vicious and more personal than ever before; when the BBC's commercial competitors are more ruthless than they have ever been; and when some politicians and commentators seem more interested in quick headlines than in trying to understand the real issues? </p> <p> The answer, of course, is we have no option. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully and none of us joined the BBC to do that. </p> <p> <strong>Digital TV </strong></p> <p> The changes happening in technology; in the wider society; and in our competitive environment are what make this one of those times in history when change at the BBC is essential. </p> <p> Let's take technology first. Digital television, and with it as many as 160 channels in digital satellite homes, has arrived at a pace faster than any could have imagined, certainly faster than I anticipated when I gave this lecture six years ago. </p> <p> But we are only just beginning to see what digital television can really bring. Electronic programme guides are already changing viewing habits in digital homes dramatically, but the real revolution will come with the arrival of the TiVo box and similar in-home, hard disc recording technologies which will give the consumer complete freedom to watch what they want, when they want it. </p> <p> I still believe there will be a role for conventional channels by the end of this decade - at times people will still want informed selection - but the channels are likely to be more focused, and aimed either at particular audience groups or based on particular programme genres. </p> <p> <strong>Changing society </strong></p> <p> Secondly society is changing. Huge gulfs have opened up in the attitudes and values of different generations in a way not seen before.</p> <p> In recent research people from different age groups were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement, \"There is too much sex, bad language and violence on TV and in cinema today.\" Amongst the over 45's 72% said they agreed. Amongst the 25 to 34 year olds 79% disagreed. </p> <p> This dramatic polarisation of views creates real challenges for programme makers, broadcasters and regulators alike, particularly in the areas of taste and decency. </p> <p> The people brought up in the Thatcher age are the biggest challenge of all whether you're a politician, the Chief Executive of Marks and Spencer or a television executive. </p> <p> For these are the children of the multichannel age, they are used to choice and love it - whether it's shopping, music or television and they are certainly not deferential to Britain's traditional institutions like the BBC. </p> <p> This generation doesn't complain if they don't like our schedules they simply turn over. \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" is disappearing and being replaced by \"Not bothered of Newcastle\". </p> <p> And as the retiring speaker of the House of Commons reminded us recently this is also a generation with very little interest in conventional politics. </p> <p> However what we know is that they are passionate about many of the important issues of our times, they just don't think Westminster politics can provide the answers. </p> <p> <strong> Competition </strong></p> <p> I believe this will become an increasingly serious problem for broadcasters and programme-makers steeped in a tradition of reporting conventional politics. </p> <p> If the BBC is to stay relevant over this decade we have to understand this generation and meet their needs, not only because they matter, but because we are all being influenced by them. In the old days kids wanted to be like their parents. These days parents, terrified of growing old, want to be more like their kids. </p> <p> As Bob Dylan wrote \"I was so much older then I'm younger than that now.\" </p> <p> The third reason the BBC has to change is that the BBC's competitive environment has changed and will be transformed beyond recognition in the next decade. Consolidation and merger are the order of the day amongst media companies. </p> <p> Our competitors today are bigger, richer and more ruthless than at any time in the BBC's history. They are increasingly part of a global media industry which has access to vast capital funds. This is competition on a scale the BBC has never seen before. </p> <p> It's this combination of factors which mean that this is one of those periods when the BBC, and BBC Television in particular, has to go through fundamental change. In the words of Margaret Thatcher, \"there is no alternative\". </p> <p> Inside the BBC we have been discussing the changes we need to make to our television channels since I first took over, as no doubt many of you have read in Broadcast and elsewhere. </p> <p> One thing I have discovered in that time is that there is no such thing as a confidential debate in the BBC, but if a few headlines are the price you pay for an open and questioning environment it is a price worth paying. </p> <p> At the BBC we all recognise that changing anything is difficult to achieve without controversy. But no-one feels this more keenly than our new Director of Television Mark Thompson who went to make the keynote speech at the Banff festival in Canada a couple of months ago. </p> <p> Mark took the opportunity to outline some ideas about the future of our television services in an intelligent and thought provoking speech. He opened the debate. </p> <p> Within days the forces of darkness came down upon him. He was accused of being a philistine with plans to turn BBC One into an all entertainment channel, which he didn't say and is not true, and relegating all serious programming to the fringes, again which he didn't say and is not true. </p> <p> It was all familiar stuff. Predictably the retired old men of the BBC came out in force to defend yesterday as they always have done and always will. Had they read the speech? I doubt it. Did they understand the arguments? Unlikely. They just want television the way it was in their day. But that simply isn't an option. </p> <p> <strong>New plans</strong></p> <p> So what are the changes we plan to make? </p> <p> Well one of the dangers of making this speech here today is, as our Head of Press said to me, I'm bound to disappoint. He told me \"people are expecting you to be Moses coming down from the mountain with tablets of stone\". </p> <p> Of course Moses had it easy - he only had to carry the stone, someone else had already worked out the messages. </p> <p> Let me make it clear, I haven't come here today with all the answers, there are no new Ten Commandments. </p> <p> What we do have are some exciting ideas for the future of BBC Television in the first decade of a new century which also happens to be the first decade of the digital age. Like all ideas some will succeed and others won't but that doesn't matter, this is only the start of a journey, the process of change is ongoing. </p> <p> Let me explain our plans in three parts. </p> <p> First of all I want to talk about money and what the BBC can and cannot afford to do. </p> <p> Secondly I'd like to talk about our proposals for a portfolio of BBC public service channels, which will eventually be available in every home in Britain. </p> <p> And finally I want to talk about the purpose of the BBC and public service broadcasting in the digital age. </p> <p> <strong>Money matters </strong></p> <p> Starting with the money then. One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. It's not enough on its own - at some time or other most of us have spent a lot of money producing a very average programme - but trying to make fantastic programmes without the right budget is incredibly difficult. </p> <p> In fact I believe one of the problems of BBC Television today is that too many of our services have been under funded. </p> <p> BBC One certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes, programming of the quality people expect from the BBC. </p> <p> If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. Firstly we have to find the money and secondly we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. </p> <p> This year's licence fee settlement, which gave us an increase of inflation plus 1.5% every year for seven years was a fair, even generous, award. By 2007 this will produce a real increase</p>",

I wasn't here for the first few years but I have been coming on and off for most of the Festival's existence. Three things have changed fundamentally since those early days.

I am very annoyed that I even got on to terms with him\". In fact, many of the changes attributed to Greene had actually been started by his predecessor Sir Ian Jacob. Reith's views of Jacob were similar to his views of Greene. When he heard Jacob's portrait was going to be hung in the Council Chamber, Reith was so angry that he demanded that his own portrait be removed. What had Jacob and Greene actually done to so upset the BBC's founder? The story is very illuminating. Under Jacob, Greene had been Director of News and Current Affairs and had set about introducing radical change. In the mid-fifties the great joke about BBC News was that every newsreel would begin, \"The Queen Mother yesterday\u00bf\". I do, of course, realise that I am on dangerous ground when talking of the Queen Mother, but I'll take the risk. Back to the joke. All newsreels started \"The Queen Mother yesterday\". The Queen Mother because everyone loved the Queen Mother; and yesterday because it took the BBC at least a day to check with the Queen Mother that she had done what she was said to have done, even though they had film of her doing it. Greene set about changing the whole journalistic ethos of the BBC, transforming a largely obsequious and deferential institution into a gritty news organisation that could respond swiftly and imaginatively. At the heart of the changes were two extremely controversial views, though: firstly that television not newspapers would prove to be the bedrock of news reporting in the future; and secondly that news and current affairs had to be less isolated from the rest of the BBC. ITV on the scene It was out of these twin beliefs that truly ground-breaking genre-defying programmes like Cathy Come Home were later to spring. After two years running News and Current Affairs, Greene became Director-General in 1960 at a time of real turmoil in the industry. Interestingly on becoming Director-General one of Greene's first actions was to move the nine o'clock news on the old Home Service, now Radio Four, to ten o'clock. You will not be surprised to know that the decision was ferociously attacked at the time. By 1960 BBC Television was in real trouble. ITV had come into existence in 1954 and after a difficult start was making life very hard for the BBC. BBC Television's share had gone from 100% to 34% in only six years, and remember this was still only a two channel world. With quiz programmes like Double Your Money, Take Your Pick and a raft of popular American series, ITV was stealing the hearts and minds of British viewers. Meanwhile BBC Television, obsessed with its own importance, was inward looking and hardly seemed to notice what was going on. Jacob and Greene set about changing this. For the first time British audiences were to be offered a diet of programming that was both challenging and popular, programmes like Play for Today, Z Cars, The Forsyte Saga, That Was the Week That Was, Til Death Us Do Part, Doctor Who, Monty Python's Flying Circus and literally dozens of others. It wasn't that Greene produced these programmes, of course he didn't. But he did make them possible. He gave BBC producers the ambition to make popular quality programming for the first time - programmes which both appealed to large audiences and made a difference to their lives. In rating terms, the BBC made a great recovery which left ITV with no option but to follow the BBC's lead, effectively making Greene the founder of modern day British television. Radio reforms And it didn't end with television either. When Radio Caroline and other pirate stations started broadcasting under a Panamanian flag of convenience in 1964 he not only argued that they should be closed down, but along with Frank Gillard, his legendary head of radio, he put in place the now familiar pattern of Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. Imagine the fuss that caused. Greene and Gillard's reforms of radio and television brought cries of derision. A Times leader accused the BBC of \"abandoning their role as the sponsors and protectors of quality broadcasting\". Even the now seemingly innocuous Z Cars received its fair share of condemnation. The Chief Constable of Lancashire, Colonel Eric St Johnstone, demanded that it be cancelled. His force, to a man, he complained, were full of disgust. Mary Whitehouse complained about the spate of modern plays on the BBC: \"We are told that the dramatists are portraying real life, but why concentrate on the kitchen sink when there are so many pleasant sitting rooms?\" No wonder she said of Greene: \"If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies, I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carleton Greene.\" Outrage from journalists, politicians, the great and the good and even some of the BBC's own staff at any mooted change in BBC radio or television is a pattern you can find throughout the history of the BBC. Just look at the last decade - changes within all of our memories. Remember the fuss and outrage when Matthew Bannister re-shaped and effectively re-invented Radio 1 in the mid Nineties? Yet Radio 1 is now seen as one of the great success stories of the BBC. Remember the fuss when the BBC created Radio Five Live with the idea of starting a radio station aimed at a younger audience and based around news and sport? Today Five Live is supreme in its field and its audience is still growing rapidly year by year. Remember when John Birt set up BBC Online? He was widely accused of wasting licence payers' money and yet now it is the most visited content site in Europe and widely loved by some of the very people who accused him of wasting money at the time. Populism Long before any of these recent examples, a few of you may remember Grace Archer's death in the Archers - which just happened to coincide with the opening night of ITV. It was greeted by Denis Pitts in the Daily Herald with the following denunciation: \"The BBC went too far on Thursday when, for the sake of a stunt, they killed off Grace Archer. The stunt was mean, callous and cold-blooded. I accuse the BBC of a shabby trick which has left an unpleasant taste in nine million mouths. I am angry. So is my wife.\" You have to wonder what his wife would have thought about EastEnders. In the sixties the opponents of change and in particular Greene's style of populism were everywhere. We now see Steptoe and Son as the great turning point in British situation comedy, a seminal series which helped pave the way for Dad's Army, 'Til Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and many others. But it wasn't always perceived as that. Wilfrid Brambell - the Shakespearean actor who played Steptoe senior said at the time: \"I suppose every actor has to get into dustbin drama sooner or later\". One wonders if anyone today would ever have heard of Brambell if he hadn't got into \"dustbin drama\" - I rather doubt it. None of this is new. As the BBC's Chief Archivist described it to me, \"The BBC has been accused of dumbing down from the day Reith invented it.\" Propose any significant change and the BBC is accused of betraying its heritage. The point is that the real genius of the BBC is that it has adapted and changed over the years. Successive generations of leaders have not simply taken the flame of public service broadcasting as a whole and passed it on unchanged. At crucial times in the BBC's history they have recognised that change was essential and have taken the bold decision to introduce it despite loud protests from all around them. By and large history has rewarded their courage and their detractors have been forgotten. No Director-General was more criticised than Greene and yet today his memory is revered - without Greene there would not be the BBC as we know it. Reith invented the BBC for one age. Greene re-invented it for another. John Birt Of course it's pretty obvious why there are so many howls when anyone wants to change even comparatively small parts of the BBC. It was Machiavelli, when writing The Prince, who summed it up when he wrote: \"There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. \"For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who would gain by the new.\" Oddly when I looked up that quote in my files written on the same sheet was one which is less philosophical but equally applicable. It was from the former French President General De Gaulle who said, \"Never stand between the dog and the lamp post.\" So given this history, why try to change the BBC? Look at the venom directed at John Birt - the man who had the courage to start the modernisation process at the BBC. Why be radical in an age when attacks from sections of the press are more vicious and more personal than ever before; when the BBC's commercial competitors are more ruthless than they have ever been; and when some politicians and commentators seem more interested in quick headlines than in trying to understand the real issues? The answer, of course, is we have no option. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully and none of us joined the BBC to do that. Digital TV The changes happening in technology; in the wider society; and in our competitive environment are what make this one of those times in history when change at the BBC is essential. Let's take technology first. Digital television, and with it as many as 160 channels in digital satellite homes, has arrived at a pace faster than any could have imagined, certainly faster than I anticipated when I gave this lecture six years ago. But we are only just beginning to see what digital television can really bring. Electronic programme guides are already changing viewing habits in digital homes dramatically, but the real revolution will come with the arrival of the TiVo box and similar in-home, hard disc recording technologies which will give the consumer complete freedom to watch what they want, when they want it. I still believe there will be a role for conventional channels by the end of this decade - at times people will still want informed selection - but the channels are likely to be more focused, and aimed either at particular audience groups or based on particular programme genres. Changing society Secondly society is changing. Huge gulfs have opened up in the attitudes and values of different generations in a way not seen before. In recent research people from different age groups were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement, \"There is too much sex, bad language and violence on TV and in cinema today.\" Amongst the over 45's 72% said they agreed. Amongst the 25 to 34 year olds 79% disagreed. This dramatic polarisation of views creates real challenges for programme makers, broadcasters and regulators alike, particularly in the areas of taste and decency. The people brought up in the Thatcher age are the biggest challenge of all whether you're a politician, the Chief Executive of Marks and Spencer or a television executive. For these are the children of the multichannel age, they are used to choice and love it - whether it's shopping, music or television and they are certainly not deferential to Britain's traditional institutions like the BBC. This generation doesn't complain if they don't like our schedules they simply turn over. \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" is disappearing and being replaced by \"Not bothered of Newcastle\". And as the retiring speaker of the House of Commons reminded us recently this is also a generation with very little interest in conventional politics. However what we know is that they are passionate about many of the important issues of our times, they just don't think Westminster politics can provide the answers. Competition I believe this will become an increasingly serious problem for broadcasters and programme-makers steeped in a tradition of reporting conventional politics. If the BBC is to stay relevant over this decade we have to understand this generation and meet their needs, not only because they matter, but because we are all being influenced by them. In the old days kids wanted to be like their parents. These days parents, terrified of growing old, want to be more like their kids. As Bob Dylan wrote \"I was so much older then I'm younger than that now.\" The third reason the BBC has to change is that the BBC's competitive environment has changed and will be transformed beyond recognition in the next decade. Consolidation and merger are the order of the day amongst media companies. Our competitors today are bigger, richer and more ruthless than at any time in the BBC's history. They are increasingly part of a global media industry which has access to vast capital funds. This is competition on a scale the BBC has never seen before. It's this combination of factors which mean that this is one of those periods when the BBC, and BBC Television in particular, has to go through fundamental change. In the words of Margaret Thatcher, \"there is no alternative\". Inside the BBC we have been discussing the changes we need to make to our television channels since I first took over, as no doubt many of you have read in Broadcast and elsewhere. One thing I have discovered in that time is that there is no such thing as a confidential debate in the BBC, but if a few headlines are the price you pay for an open and questioning environment it is a price worth paying. At the BBC we all recognise that changing anything is difficult to achieve without controversy. But no-one feels this more keenly than our new Director of Television Mark Thompson who went to make the keynote speech at the Banff festival in Canada a couple of months ago. Mark took the opportunity to outline some ideas about the future of our television services in an intelligent and thought provoking speech. He opened the debate. Within days the forces of darkness came down upon him. He was accused of being a philistine with plans to turn BBC One into an all entertainment channel, which he didn't say and is not true, and relegating all serious programming to the fringes, again which he didn't say and is not true. It was all familiar stuff. Predictably the retired old men of the BBC came out in force to defend yesterday as they always have done and always will. Had they read the speech? I doubt it. Did they understand the arguments? Unlikely. They just want television the way it was in their day. But that simply isn't an option. New plans So what are the changes we plan to make? Well one of the dangers of making this speech here today is, as our Head of Press said to me, I'm bound to disappoint. He told me \"people are expecting you to be Moses coming down from the mountain with tablets of stone\". Of course Moses had it easy - he only had to carry the stone, someone else had already worked out the messages. Let me make it clear, I haven't come here today with all the answers, there are no new Ten Commandments. What we do have are some exciting ideas for the future of BBC Television in the first decade of a new century which also happens to be the first decade of the digital age. Like all ideas some will succeed and others won't but that doesn't matter, this is only the start of a journey, the process of change is ongoing. Let me explain our plans in three parts. First of all I want to talk about money and what the BBC can and cannot afford to do. Secondly I'd like to talk about our proposals for a portfolio of BBC public service channels, which will eventually be available in every home in Britain. And finally I want to talk about the purpose of the BBC and public service broadcasting in the digital age. Money matters Starting with the money then. One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. It's not enough on its own - at some time or other most of us have spent a lot of money producing a very average programme - but trying to make fantastic programmes without the right budget is incredibly difficult. In fact I believe one of the problems of BBC Television today is that too many of our services have been under funded. BBC One certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes, programming of the quality people expect from the BBC. If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. Firstly we have to find the money and secondly we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. This year's licence fee settlement, which gave us an increase of inflation plus 1.5% every year for seven years was a fair, even generous, award. By 2007 this will produce a real increase",

For something a little less hardcore, there's a real buzz (sorry) about Tarina Tarantino's colourful \"baby bee\" earrings (\u00a335, tel 020-77301234 for stockists), Anya Hindmarch's \"ant\" shopper (\u00a3295, 020-7838 9177) or, if you really can't face the nastier creepy crawlies, sleep easy with Debenhams' gorgeous butterfly-strewn bedlinen, designed by Lulu Guinness (from \u00a315 for a pillowcase, 020-7408 4444). Go on, have a flutter.",

Both experts concluded that Alder, who was accused by one officer on the videotape of faking and being \"as right as rain\", died because of blocked air passages that might have been cleared by emergency medical help.</p> <p>The four constables and a sergeant shown on the video as Alder lay dying on the floor of the custody suite at Queen's Gardens police station in Hull are currently suspended and face criminal charges of misconduct in public office amounting to wilful neglect. They declined to answer potentially incriminating questions at the inquest on more than 150 occasions. The inquest heard that Sgt John Dunne and PCs Nigel Dawson, Neil Blakey, Mark Ellerington and Matthew Barr all thought that Alder was play-acting or asleep until Barr suddenly noticed he had stopped breathing and a vain life-saving attempt was organised.</p> <p>Alder's sister Janet said: \"Justice has been done at last, but it has taken 28 months to get to the only true verdict which could have been given. I want to thank the jury and send them my compliments, and let's hope now we get a proper prosecution.\"</p> <p>Ms Alder's solicitor, Ruth Bundy, said the CPS should be looking at the possibility of gross negligence or manslaughter charges against the Humberside officers, after the evidence that emerged during the six-week hearing. She also criticised the Hull coroner, Geoffrey Saul, for concluding his instructions to the jury with a statement that the inquest - the longest to be held into a death in police custody - had seen no evidence that \"what happened that night had anything to do with the colour of Christopher's skin\".</p> <p>Ms Bundy, whose case was one of the first to be funded under new legislation extending legal aid to inquests of particular public interest, said: \"When is racism ever overt in these cases? The MacPherson report has taught us all about institutional racism, and that terrible image on the film of a black man left like a sack of potatoes to die on the floor speaks volumes about skin colour.\"</p> <p>The jury had been warned by Mr Saul not to allow the video to overshadow other evidence, including the fact that the police had been told by emergency staff at Hull royal infirmary that Alder was fit to go home. He was arrested after refusing to leave the hospital, where he was taken after a fight outside the Waterfront, a club in Hull city centre.</p>",

Calls for an independent body to examine all deaths in police custody, and particularly why so many involve members of ethnic minorities, were galvanised by the decision yesterday at Hull coroner's court. The jury of five men and three women - reduced by one after a member was discharged for allegedly making a racist remark - reached its decision after watching the graphic police video of the last 12 minutes of Alder's life.

Both experts concluded that Alder, who was accused by one officer on the videotape of faking and being \"as right as rain\", died because of blocked air passages that might have been cleared by emergency medical help. The four constables and a sergeant shown on the video as Alder lay dying on the floor of the custody suite at Queen's Gardens police station in Hull are currently suspended and face criminal charges of misconduct in public office amounting to wilful neglect. They declined to answer potentially incriminating questions at the inquest on more than 150 occasions. The inquest heard that Sgt John Dunne and PCs Nigel Dawson, Neil Blakey, Mark Ellerington and Matthew Barr all thought that Alder was play-acting or asleep until Barr suddenly noticed he had stopped breathing and a vain life-saving attempt was organised. Alder's sister Janet said: \"Justice has been done at last, but it has taken 28 months to get to the only true verdict which could have been given. I want to thank the jury and send them my compliments, and let's hope now we get a proper prosecution.\" Ms Alder's solicitor, Ruth Bundy, said the CPS should be looking at the possibility of gross negligence or manslaughter charges against the Humberside officers, after the evidence that emerged during the six-week hearing. She also criticised the Hull coroner, Geoffrey Saul, for concluding his instructions to the jury with a statement that the inquest - the longest to be held into a death in police custody - had seen no evidence that \"what happened that night had anything to do with the colour of Christopher's skin\". Ms Bundy, whose case was one of the first to be funded under new legislation extending legal aid to inquests of particular public interest, said: \"When is racism ever overt in these cases? The MacPherson report has taught us all about institutional racism, and that terrible image on the film of a black man left like a sack of potatoes to die on the floor speaks volumes about skin colour.\" The jury had been warned by Mr Saul not to allow the video to overshadow other evidence, including the fact that the police had been told by emergency staff at Hull royal infirmary that Alder was fit to go home. He was arrested after refusing to leave the hospital, where he was taken after a fight outside the Waterfront, a club in Hull city centre.",

We are seeking advice on how to proceed.\"</p> <p>English Heritage said its experts considered the work \"unfortunate, to say the least\". One classical architect described the effect as \"patched up\".</p> <p><b> Flamboyant</b><br></p> <p>Lord Foster's firm, Foster and Partners, was chosen as architect for the prestigious project and in 1997 tenders were invited for the construction work. Five companies bid and Easton Masonry, run by a flamboyant Dorset stonemason, Geoff Smith, won with a tender of \u00a31.75m. The museum was confident he would do a good job as his company had been behind commendable work on the Guildhall in the City, and the Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery.</p> <p>The contract stipulated that the portico had to be built in \"an oolithic limestone - Portland stone ... or similar\". Under European law it is not legal to specify that Portland stone itself should be used. Oolithic simply means \"egg-shaped\" and describes many thousands of limestones.</p> <p>Museum officials, however, claim they were led to believe that Portland stone would be used. Suzanna Taverne, managing director of the museum, claimed that the contractor always referred to it as Portland, and in the drawings the stone was labelled \"Portland\".</p> <p>Manufacture began in March 1998 and 1,000 tonnes of stone were moved on site in March 1999. The museum says that just before the stone arrived the museum received an anonymous tip-off that French stone had been used instead.</p> <p>Ms Taverne insisted that rumours about the stone had not reached the Bloomsbury museum beforehand - even though the South Dorset MP, Ian Bruce, had been corresponding since the previous summer with both the culture department and Foster and Partners about the allegations regarding the stone.</p> <p>In August 1998, the minister for the arts, Alan Howarth, wrote to Mr Bruce insisting that the stone was definitely Portland. He wrote: \"The Heritage Lottery Fund's project monitors have confirmed that 'real' Portland stone is being used for the new portico.\"</p> <p>The same month, Giles Robinson, of Foster and Partners, wrote to a rival stone quarry which had been making its own inquiries, insisting that there was \"no confusion\" about the stone. In October, he wrote again, saying: \"I would like to reassure you that Portland stone is being used.\"</p> <p>Samples of the stone had been tested throughout - but passed as Portland by the British Museum. After the rumours reached the museum, further tests were carried out which established in June last year that the stone was not Portland. Finally, it was discovered that it was the French stone Anstrude Roche Claire, an excellent stone but one not considered as fine as Portland.</p> <p>By September 1999, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, was involved. He said the Heritage Lottery Fund was \"exploring further\" why Portland stone had not been used and English Heritage was being commissioned to investigate. Later that month his officials were investigating to establish \"whether there has been an attempt at fraud\".</p> <p>The museum is furious. Ms Taverne alleged yesterday: \"We were taken in.\" Asked if the museum had been naive, she said: \"With hindsight, you wonder if you should have been more vigilant.\" The stonemason, Mr Smith, was not available for comment yesterday. A receptionist at his company said neither he nor his secretary were in the office.</p> <p>Mr Bruce said that in conversations he had had with the stonemason, Mr Smith had insisted that he had done nothing wrong, claiming that it had been known what sort of stone he was using. Experts estimate that he could have saved around \u00a3100,000 by using the French stone.</p> <p>The museum could have ordered that the French stone be removed and the work begun again - at an estimated cost of \u00a33m - or persevere and hope the end result was satisfactory. It decided on the latter course, but does not intend to pay Easton Masonry its fee of \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Critics have said pressure to finish the millennium scheme this year might have had an undue influence on the decision.</p> <p>English Heritage inspected the work last October and decided that the stone was \"adequate\", but yesterday a spokesman admitted it had been \"surprised\" by the colour of the stone when the scaffolding was recently removed. It will not make its final judgment until the project is finished in December.</p> <p>Yesterday a meeting was taking place between Camden council, the museum and English Heritage. A spokeswoman said the options were being discussed and it was possible that the stone could be treated or coloured.</p> <p>Another project designed by Lord Foster - the wobbling pedestrian Millennium Bridge over the Thames - has already caused huge controversy.</p> <p><b>It's all in the ooliths</b></p> <p><b> Portland stone</b></p> <p><b> Age</b> Dates from the Jurassic period 145m years ago</p> <p><b> Where it is found</b> Portland in Dorset</p> <p><b> How it is created</b> Dissolved carbon dioxide in shallow, tropical seas reacted with calcium and bicarbonate ions to create thick layers of lime.

Five companies bid and Easton Masonry, run by a flamboyant Dorset stonemason, Geoff Smith, won with a tender of \u00a31.75m. The museum was confident he would do a good job as his company had been behind commendable work on the Guildhall in the City, and the Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery. The contract stipulated that the portico had to be built in \"an oolithic limestone - Portland stone ... or similar\". Under European law it is not legal to specify that Portland stone itself should be used. Oolithic simply means \"egg-shaped\" and describes many thousands of limestones. Museum officials, however, claim they were led to believe that Portland stone would be used. Suzanna Taverne, managing director of the museum, claimed that the contractor always referred to it as Portland, and in the drawings the stone was labelled \"Portland\". Manufacture began in March 1998 and 1,000 tonnes of stone were moved on site in March 1999. The museum says that just before the stone arrived the museum received an anonymous tip-off that French stone had been used instead. Ms Taverne insisted that rumours about the stone had not reached the Bloomsbury museum beforehand - even though the South Dorset MP, Ian Bruce, had been corresponding since the previous summer with both the culture department and Foster and Partners about the allegations regarding the stone. In August 1998, the minister for the arts, Alan Howarth, wrote to Mr Bruce insisting that the stone was definitely Portland. He wrote: \"The Heritage Lottery Fund's project monitors have confirmed that 'real' Portland stone is being used for the new portico.\" The same month, Giles Robinson, of Foster and Partners, wrote to a rival stone quarry which had been making its own inquiries, insisting that there was \"no confusion\" about the stone. In October, he wrote again, saying: \"I would like to reassure you that Portland stone is being used.\" Samples of the stone had been tested throughout - but passed as Portland by the British Museum. After the rumours reached the museum, further tests were carried out which established in June last year that the stone was not Portland. Finally, it was discovered that it was the French stone Anstrude Roche Claire, an excellent stone but one not considered as fine as Portland. By September 1999, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, was involved. He said the Heritage Lottery Fund was \"exploring further\" why Portland stone had not been used and English Heritage was being commissioned to investigate. Later that month his officials were investigating to establish \"whether there has been an attempt at fraud\". The museum is furious. Ms Taverne alleged yesterday: \"We were taken in.\" Asked if the museum had been naive, she said: \"With hindsight, you wonder if you should have been more vigilant.\" The stonemason, Mr Smith, was not available for comment yesterday. A receptionist at his company said neither he nor his secretary were in the office. Mr Bruce said that in conversations he had had with the stonemason, Mr Smith had insisted that he had done nothing wrong, claiming that it had been known what sort of stone he was using. Experts estimate that he could have saved around \u00a3100,000 by using the French stone. The museum could have ordered that the French stone be removed and the work begun again - at an estimated cost of \u00a33m - or persevere and hope the end result was satisfactory. It decided on the latter course, but does not intend to pay Easton Masonry its fee of \u00a3250,000. Critics have said pressure to finish the millennium scheme this year might have had an undue influence on the decision. English Heritage inspected the work last October and decided that the stone was \"adequate\", but yesterday a spokesman admitted it had been \"surprised\" by the colour of the stone when the scaffolding was recently removed. It will not make its final judgment until the project is finished in December. Yesterday a meeting was taking place between Camden council, the museum and English Heritage. A spokeswoman said the options were being discussed and it was possible that the stone could be treated or coloured. Another project designed by Lord Foster - the wobbling pedestrian Millennium Bridge over the Thames - has already caused huge controversy. It's all in the ooliths Portland stone Age Dates from the Jurassic period 145m years ago Where it is found Portland in Dorset How it is created Dissolved carbon dioxide in shallow, tropical seas reacted with calcium and bicarbonate ions to create thick layers of lime. When the sea level dropped they were compressed under deposits from saline lagoons Cost A 1,000 cubic metre block costs around \u00a30.5m Qualities Considered a very 'fine' stone because it can be carved in a very straight line without the risk of crumbling. It is also very strong as the space between the grains, or ooliths, is very small. As seen at St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, Buckingham Palace, much of Whitehall Anstrude Roche Claire Age From the Jurassic age Where it is found An area north-west of Dijon in France How it is created Similar except for differences in colour and texture Cost A little cheaper - around \u00a3400,000 for 1,000 cubic metres Qualities Slightly less good for detailed carving work and not as strong As seen at The Banque de France and the Casino d'Enghien in Paris",

      "body": "<p><strong>Mike Selvey misses the big Test - and it's not the first time</strong></p> <p>It won't be long before there are at least 50,000 proud English men and women claiming to have witnessed the breathtaking victory over West Indies last Friday night. But one key figure who rarely misses anything England do wasn't at Headingley for even one minute of two days' pulsating play. Mike Selvey, The Guardian cricket correspondent who doubles up as a summariser on the BBC's Test Match Special, was taking a long-planned holiday in Turkey. David Hopps, who's Yorkshire born and bred, deputised as capably as you would expect. </p> <p>It's obviously difficult for cricket writers to take breaks during the school holidays, but Selvey - who played his first two Tests as a fast-medium bowler against the mighty Windies side of 1976, taking three wickets in his first 20 balls in international cricket - has a special case: three years ago his wife, Sarah, gave birth to triplets, two girls and a boy. </p> <p>It transpires that Selvey - who, at 52, is quite senior to father one small child, let alone triplets - has had an arrangement for the past couple of years to miss one home Test per summer in order to do the best by his family. But as one colleague puts it: \"It turned out to be a bit of a porker.\"</p> <p>There's no suggestion whatsoever that Selvey was skiving. The Guardian has few regrets about letting its cricket correspondent take this particular break. \"The arrangement is not unreasonable, especially now there are seven Tests a summer,\" says Neil Robinson, the deputy sports editor. \"We're a caring, sharing, family newspaper.\"</p> <p>There is another, much smaller, factor. Selvey, who returns home this weekend well in time to cover the Oval Test and the lead-up to it, is thought to dislike Headingley and its low, ground-level press box. Even so, he must be wondering why on earth he chose to miss the last Test rather than, say, the drawn third game at Old Trafford. That Turkish sun tan, well deserved rest and richly merited family time must seem a bit hollow after England's greatest Test victory since Botham and Willis routed the Aussies at Leeds in 1981. </p> <p>It's sort of happened before. In 1990 Selvey took a late July holiday during the Lord's Test against India, a magical affair in which Graham Gooch (333) led a blaze of run-scoring, Kapil Dev hit four successive sixes off Eddie Hemmings to save the follow-on, and England emerged victors by 247 runs. So next time you notice that Selvey's on holiday, book your seat (at the ground, that is) - and place your bets - for another England spectacular.</p> <p><strong>Shane's big secret: dreaming of that 50th wicket all the way from Melbourne to London</strong></p> <p>How did Shane Warne manage to step off a plane from Australia at 6.20am on Tuesday and go straight onto the field for Hampshire against Kent, taking a wicket by midday, and three in the day? It was not a bad day's Championship work: 28 overs, 19 of them bowled either side of tea, and 3-88, including a caught-and-bowled and another sharpish catch. </p> <p>Even in these crazy days, very few players have to play important matches at opposite ends of the world in the space of 48 hours. Surely Warne had been treated to a first-class seat, complete with bed and all manner of other luxuries, for the demanding 26-hour flight back from the three indoor one-dayers against South Africa in his native Melbourne? Bearing in mind Warne's huge earnings - his Hampshire season is worth at least \u00a3650,000 to him - maybe he even splashed out himself on first-class?</p> <p>Not so. Like nearly all internationals nowadays, Warne was flown back business class: the Australian Cricket Board has a special deal with Cathay Pacific, so will not have been charged the full return fare of \u00a32,688.</p> <p>Business class may be a lot more comfortable than economy, but Warne has a special magic in such matters. As he may reveal in his exclusive column for The Times on Saturday, this sharpest and most alert of stars can sleep just about anywhere, anytime. </p> <p>Brian Murgatroyd, the ACB's media manager, explained from Melbourne yesterday: \"Shane's probably the best sleeper on a plane of any of our players. The aircraft taxies down the runway, his head's on the pillow and he's out like a light.\" Murgatroyd added: \"Shane can sleep for Australia. He has an unenviable ability to sleep on planes. And he always emerges looking fresh as a daisy.\" And before you jump to any conclusions, remember that, with his metabolism, Warne is unlikely to have needed to resort to alcohol or even sleeping pills to get a good kip in flight.</p> <p>Even so, Warne and the other Aussie one-day players returning to their counties (Glenn McGrath, Michael Bevan and Ian Harvey) didn't have the simplest of journeys. Since Cathay always flies a decidedly indirect route - via its Hong Kong base - the trip takes several hours longer than with other leading airlines with stopovers in Bangkok or Singapore.</p> <p>Having left Melbourne on flight CX104 at 1.15pm local time (4.15am in the UK) on Monday, the players had to exit the aircraft, and kill three hours in the business-class lounge at Hong Kong. Worse, they discovered that their flight on to London (CX251) would arrive at Heathrow airport two and a half hours late - making the 11am start of play at Canterbury, a two-hour drive from Heathrow in morning traffic, a \"hard call\", as Warne would put it.</p> <p>So the quartet had to switch to an earlier Cathay flight, CX255. That landed in London on schedule at about 6.20am - but still 35 minutes after they should have touched down. </p> <p>Warne, who had no doubt been dreaming about taking his 50th championship wicket for Hampshire that day (he was to end this longest of all days on 49), was collected by Tim Tremlett, the county's director of cricket, and whisked to Canterbury.</p> <p>By 9am Warne was refuelling with a hearty breakfast in the players' dining room. He'd been to Australia for a mere 14 days, just making the ACB arrival deadline of August 7. The last of the Aussies to arrive home, Warne was of course the first back in action here. By the time he left the field, having admittedly shown signs of jet lag towards the end of the day, it was 3.30am according to his time clock. By the time he put out the light, it would have been 6am or 7am the next day, Melbourne time.</p> <p><strong>Do of the Week (the seventh in an occasional series)</strong></p> <p><strong>Occasion</strong> Wisden Cricket Monthly's 21st birthday celebration cricket match at \"the world's most beautiful cricket ground\", Sir Paul Getty's private ground at Wormsley in Oxfordshire, on Tuesday, August 15. Two teams of guests, cricketing celebrities and WCM staff squared up over 35 overs a side, in fine weather, on a typically flat Wormsley surface.</p> <p>There was drama even before things got underway. The Words were to have been led by Steven Lynch, the magazine's managing editor, but a toe injury forced him out. In stepped wisden.com's assistant editor Lawrence Booth. A shame: spectators would have enjoyed a glimpse of Lynch's celebrated leg-spinners. The Pictures were led by Colin Ackehurst, business development and advertising sales manager. \"On paper,\" said Booth in a pre-match \"interview\", \"the sides are evenly matched. We've shared out the ex-pros. We have the better batsmen - Tim O'Gorman, ex-Derbyshire and Jon Hardy, ex-Hampshire - they the better bowlers - Gladstone Small [Warwickshire and England] and the better keeper: Stuart Waterton, once of Kent.\" </p> <p><strong>Format</strong> Pre-match drinks (Pimm's and wine), plus sandwiches, at 1pm, start of play 2pm, tea (scones and cream, and more sandwiches) between innings.</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 80 including the players. Also prominent on the team sheets were WCM advertisers. Meanwhile friends of the magazine, including some of the distributors, and their relations and friends, lounged in deckchairs watching the action.</p> <p><strong>Notable absentees</strong> Sir Paul Getty, owner of the Almanack as well as the magazine, who had prior commitments elsewhere, Alvin Kallicharran, who was due to play for The Words but suddenly had to return to the Caribbean, Sir Viv Richards - still too good to be invited to play, but warmly welcomed as a spectator - and Tim de Lisle, editor of WCM and wisden.com, who'd intended to be there (as a host and spectator) but was detained by work. Maybe it was just as well: in this fixture two years ago Lynch crashed into de Lisle - yes, we're brothers - as they both went for a ball in the covers. Lynch, who has a bigger frame, was relatively unscathed; de Lisle, sadly, had a broken collarbone.</p> <p><strong>Principal entertainment</strong> The match, a relaxed affair in which the toss - but almost nothing else - was \"fixed\": the captains agreed that The Words should bat first. To give everyone a chance, and prevent the ex-pros taking over, batsmen had to retire at 50, and bowlers were limited to seven overs. Gladstone Small only managed four before pulling up, claiming a groin injury. </p> <p>O'Gorman, opening for The Words, duly reached 50, and although Hardy deliberately ran himself out on 42, the side ran up 184-4 in their 35 overs. Pick of the bowlers: Simon Briggs, who recently left WCM for The Daily Telegraph. Medium fast with a high arm action, he consistently put the ball on the right spot, finishing with 1-41 in his seven overs.</p> <p>In reply The Pictures collapsed to 24-3, before Waterton and Justin Ricketts, of Play-Sport New Media, revived them with half-centuries each. Ricketts pressed home the advantage when he drove firmly to mid-off, injuring Booth's finger and forcing him off the field for four overs. The Words had lost their second captain, and were reduced to ten men (there were no twelfth men). </p> <p>Waterton and the stylish Ricketts took severe toll on Hugh Chevallier, managing editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, whose erratic medium pace went for 0-49 in 5.5 overs. Thanks partly to some sloppy fielding, The Pictures (186-4) made it with more than three overs to spare, Sam Miller of Chase Sport hitting the winning boundary - off Chevallier, needless to say - and finishing unbeaten on 42. Winning captain Ackehurst was presented with a bottle of champagne, which was duly shared with his team-mates. Ackehurst, who originated the first in this series of matches back in 1998, wasn't just pleased about the result. \"This day is all about getting people together on an informal basis. It's a wonderful atmosphere and great fun. The ex-pros try hard and it's great for our friends to come to Wormsley and sit next to someone like Gladstone Small at tea. It's the sort of thing they can dine out on for months.\"</p> <p><strong>Main talking point</strong> Who would claim the Man of the Match award? By tradition the ex-pros are excluded from consideration. That left 18 possibilities (at least in theory). Adjudicator Steven Lynch finally plumped for Ricketts, who'd also taken 1-42 with his legspinners. General verdict?

      "bodyText": "Mike Selvey misses the big Test - and it's not the first time It won't be long before there are at least 50,000 proud English men and women claiming to have witnessed the breathtaking victory over West Indies last Friday night. But one key figure who rarely misses anything England do wasn't at Headingley for even one minute of two days' pulsating play. Mike Selvey, The Guardian cricket correspondent who doubles up as a summariser on the BBC's Test Match Special, was taking a long-planned holiday in Turkey. David Hopps, who's Yorkshire born and bred, deputised as capably as you would expect. It's obviously difficult for cricket writers to take breaks during the school holidays, but Selvey - who played his first two Tests as a fast-medium bowler against the mighty Windies side of 1976, taking three wickets in his first 20 balls in international cricket - has a special case: three years ago his wife, Sarah, gave birth to triplets, two girls and a boy. It transpires that Selvey - who, at 52, is quite senior to father one small child, let alone triplets - has had an arrangement for the past couple of years to miss one home Test per summer in order to do the best by his family. But as one colleague puts it: \"It turned out to be a bit of a porker.\" There's no suggestion whatsoever that Selvey was skiving. The Guardian has few regrets about letting its cricket correspondent take this particular break. \"The arrangement is not unreasonable, especially now there are seven Tests a summer,\" says Neil Robinson, the deputy sports editor. \"We're a caring, sharing, family newspaper.\" There is another, much smaller, factor. Selvey, who returns home this weekend well in time to cover the Oval Test and the lead-up to it, is thought to dislike Headingley and its low, ground-level press box. Even so, he must be wondering why on earth he chose to miss the last Test rather than, say, the drawn third game at Old Trafford. That Turkish sun tan, well deserved rest and richly merited family time must seem a bit hollow after England's greatest Test victory since Botham and Willis routed the Aussies at Leeds in 1981. It's sort of happened before. In 1990 Selvey took a late July holiday during the Lord's Test against India, a magical affair in which Graham Gooch (333) led a blaze of run-scoring, Kapil Dev hit four successive sixes off Eddie Hemmings to save the follow-on, and England emerged victors by 247 runs. So next time you notice that Selvey's on holiday, book your seat (at the ground, that is) - and place your bets - for another England spectacular. Shane's big secret: dreaming of that 50th wicket all the way from Melbourne to London How did Shane Warne manage to step off a plane from Australia at 6.20am on Tuesday and go straight onto the field for Hampshire against Kent, taking a wicket by midday, and three in the day? It was not a bad day's Championship work: 28 overs, 19 of them bowled either side of tea, and 3-88, including a caught-and-bowled and another sharpish catch. Even in these crazy days, very few players have to play important matches at opposite ends of the world in the space of 48 hours. Surely Warne had been treated to a first-class seat, complete with bed and all manner of other luxuries, for the demanding 26-hour flight back from the three indoor one-dayers against South Africa in his native Melbourne? Bearing in mind Warne's huge earnings - his Hampshire season is worth at least \u00a3650,000 to him - maybe he even splashed out himself on first-class? Not so. Like nearly all internationals nowadays, Warne was flown back business class: the Australian Cricket Board has a special deal with Cathay Pacific, so will not have been charged the full return fare of \u00a32,688. Business class may be a lot more comfortable than economy, but Warne has a special magic in such matters. As he may reveal in his exclusive column for The Times on Saturday, this sharpest and most alert of stars can sleep just about anywhere, anytime. Brian Murgatroyd, the ACB's media manager, explained from Melbourne yesterday: \"Shane's probably the best sleeper on a plane of any of our players. The aircraft taxies down the runway, his head's on the pillow and he's out like a light.\" Murgatroyd added: \"Shane can sleep for Australia. He has an unenviable ability to sleep on planes. And he always emerges looking fresh as a daisy.\" And before you jump to any conclusions, remember that, with his metabolism, Warne is unlikely to have needed to resort to alcohol or even sleeping pills to get a good kip in flight. Even so, Warne and the other Aussie one-day players returning to their counties (Glenn McGrath, Michael Bevan and Ian Harvey) didn't have the simplest of journeys. Since Cathay always flies a decidedly indirect route - via its Hong Kong base - the trip takes several hours longer than with other leading airlines with stopovers in Bangkok or Singapore. Having left Melbourne on flight CX104 at 1.15pm local time (4.15am in the UK) on Monday, the players had to exit the aircraft, and kill three hours in the business-class lounge at Hong Kong. Worse, they discovered that their flight on to London (CX251) would arrive at Heathrow airport two and a half hours late - making the 11am start of play at Canterbury, a two-hour drive from Heathrow in morning traffic, a \"hard call\", as Warne would put it. So the quartet had to switch to an earlier Cathay flight, CX255. That landed in London on schedule at about 6.20am - but still 35 minutes after they should have touched down. Warne, who had no doubt been dreaming about taking his 50th championship wicket for Hampshire that day (he was to end this longest of all days on 49), was collected by Tim Tremlett, the county's director of cricket, and whisked to Canterbury. By 9am Warne was refuelling with a hearty breakfast in the players' dining room. He'd been to Australia for a mere 14 days, just making the ACB arrival deadline of August 7. The last of the Aussies to arrive home, Warne was of course the first back in action here. By the time he left the field, having admittedly shown signs of jet lag towards the end of the day, it was 3.30am according to his time clock. By the time he put out the light, it would have been 6am or 7am the next day, Melbourne time. Do of the Week (the seventh in an occasional series) Occasion Wisden Cricket Monthly's 21st birthday celebration cricket match at \"the world's most beautiful cricket ground\", Sir Paul Getty's private ground at Wormsley in Oxfordshire, on Tuesday, August 15. Two teams of guests, cricketing celebrities and WCM staff squared up over 35 overs a side, in fine weather, on a typically flat Wormsley surface. There was drama even before things got underway. The Words were to have been led by Steven Lynch, the magazine's managing editor, but a toe injury forced him out. In stepped wisden.com's assistant editor Lawrence Booth. A shame: spectators would have enjoyed a glimpse of Lynch's celebrated leg-spinners. The Pictures were led by Colin Ackehurst, business development and advertising sales manager. \"On paper,\" said Booth in a pre-match \"interview\", \"the sides are evenly matched. We've shared out the ex-pros. We have the better batsmen - Tim O'Gorman, ex-Derbyshire and Jon Hardy, ex-Hampshire - they the better bowlers - Gladstone Small [Warwickshire and England] and the better keeper: Stuart Waterton, once of Kent.\" Format Pre-match drinks (Pimm's and wine), plus sandwiches, at 1pm, start of play 2pm, tea (scones and cream, and more sandwiches) between innings. Attendance 80 including the players. Also prominent on the team sheets were WCM advertisers. Meanwhile friends of the magazine, including some of the distributors, and their relations and friends, lounged in deckchairs watching the action. Notable absentees Sir Paul Getty, owner of the Almanack as well as the magazine, who had prior commitments elsewhere, Alvin Kallicharran, who was due to play for The Words but suddenly had to return to the Caribbean, Sir Viv Richards - still too good to be invited to play, but warmly welcomed as a spectator - and Tim de Lisle, editor of WCM and wisden.com, who'd intended to be there (as a host and spectator) but was detained by work. Maybe it was just as well: in this fixture two years ago Lynch crashed into de Lisle - yes, we're brothers - as they both went for a ball in the covers. Lynch, who has a bigger frame, was relatively unscathed; de Lisle, sadly, had a broken collarbone. Principal entertainment The match, a relaxed affair in which the toss - but almost nothing else - was \"fixed\": the captains agreed that The Words should bat first. To give everyone a chance, and prevent the ex-pros taking over, batsmen had to retire at 50, and bowlers were limited to seven overs. Gladstone Small only managed four before pulling up, claiming a groin injury. O'Gorman, opening for The Words, duly reached 50, and although Hardy deliberately ran himself out on 42, the side ran up 184-4 in their 35 overs. Pick of the bowlers: Simon Briggs, who recently left WCM for The Daily Telegraph. Medium fast with a high arm action, he consistently put the ball on the right spot, finishing with 1-41 in his seven overs. In reply The Pictures collapsed to 24-3, before Waterton and Justin Ricketts, of Play-Sport New Media, revived them with half-centuries each. Ricketts pressed home the advantage when he drove firmly to mid-off, injuring Booth's finger and forcing him off the field for four overs. The Words had lost their second captain, and were reduced to ten men (there were no twelfth men). Waterton and the stylish Ricketts took severe toll on Hugh Chevallier, managing editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, whose erratic medium pace went for 0-49 in 5.5 overs. Thanks partly to some sloppy fielding, The Pictures (186-4) made it with more than three overs to spare, Sam Miller of Chase Sport hitting the winning boundary - off Chevallier, needless to say - and finishing unbeaten on 42. Winning captain Ackehurst was presented with a bottle of champagne, which was duly shared with his team-mates. Ackehurst, who originated the first in this series of matches back in 1998, wasn't just pleased about the result. \"This day is all about getting people together on an informal basis. It's a wonderful atmosphere and great fun. The ex-pros try hard and it's great for our friends to come to Wormsley and sit next to someone like Gladstone Small at tea. It's the sort of thing they can dine out on for months.\" Main talking point Who would claim the Man of the Match award? By tradition the ex-pros are excluded from consideration. That left 18 possibilities (at least in theory). Adjudicator Steven Lynch finally plumped for Ricketts, who'd also taken 1-42 with his legspinners. General verdict? The Words exchanged more, well, words: Peter Johnson of Gunn &amp; Moore, batting at three, was not too happy at being out lbw for two. The Pictures probably played the prettier cricket. David Gower finally joins the establishment He's not everybody's idea of a committee man, but that's the role David Gower is about to assume for the first time. Gower, 43, joins the MCC committee - the heart of the game's establishment - on October 1 after winning the votes of no fewer than 77 per cent of club members.

As Gower may have noted wryly, Mickey Stewart (2,173), the former England manager who did him few favours in his autumn as a player, finished well down the field and wasn't elected. For the famously laid back Gower, who's still sometimes wrongly portrayed as a \"toff\", the move is a small, if surprising, step, in to line with that misleading image (both of the star one-time England batsman, and MCC). What does the role involve? A three-year term, half-a-dozen meetings a year, quite a lot of politics - and a great deal of paperwork. It's no surprise that two such high-profile former players should romp to victory. Nor is it remarkable that MCC, which is modernising faster than many people realise, should have decided that more media savvy, glamour, cricketing experience and youth should be injected at the top.

The Home Office had wanted the rules affecting email and phone surveillance by employers, under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, to come into force before October 2, when the European court's law comes into effect. The existing surveillance regime has already been successfully challenged in the European court of human rights and Jack Straw, the home secretary, is keen to avoid similar embarrassments under the court's landmark new rights act. But industry has strongly criticised the proposed rules on business monitoring of emails. The Alliance for Electronic Business, which includes the Confederation of British Industry has condemned the government's approach as \"totally impractical and indeed impossible\" to comply with. The alliance said the rules would \"deny businessmen day-to-day access to their own correspondence when conducted electronically by means of email or voice mail\". Under pressure from industry, the government has agreed to a three-week extension to the consultation period on the proposed rules, due to end today. \"Industry asked for more time to consult and we have been at pains to involve industry in the process,\" a Home Office official said. The proposed rules require companies to obtain the consent of both the sender and receiver of emails, voice mails and other messages for any monitoring. Industry wants the government to reverse the whole thrust of the proposals to allow the blanket monitoring of employees without consent. Civil liberty campaigners and unions consider that approach to be unacceptable. Useful links The alliance for electronic business",

      "body": "<p>Great literature has always been traduced and eviscerated on screen. Yet the peaks of imaginative writing seem to represent an irresistible challenge for film-makers. Now Dutch director Marleen Gorris, who previously adapted Mrs Dalloway with Vanessa Redgrave, has taken on a book by the 20th century's greatest sorcerer in prose, Vladimir Nabokov. Many film-makers have tried to mine the wily Russian, and this new attempt revives the question: can Nabokov ever be filmed successfully?</p> <p>Gorris has chosen Nabokov's novel The Luzhin Defence. The author wrote that out of all his novels written in Russian, it \"radiates the most warmth\". Alexander Luzhin is a chess player competing for the world title in a small Italian lakeside town in 1929. Staying at the same resort is an aristocratic young woman, Emilia, who becomes fascinated by the shambling, stuttering genius.</p> <p>Rejecting a more refined suitor, she falls in love with Luzhin and they decide to marry. But Luzhin is made anxious by the sudden reappearance of his old \"chess father\", Valentinov, the man who nurtured him as a prodigy but then abandoned him. As he draws closer to the final showdown with his arch-rival, Turati, Luzhin suspects that Valentinov has an interest in seeing him lose. </p> <p>All the major incidents from the novel are present in the film. As Luzhin, John Turturro gives a remarkable performance of distracted innocence and childlike trust; Emily Watson, too, is excellent as Emilia. In many ways, Gorris's film is the Nabokov adaptation that gets closest to the spirit of its source. But inevitably it pickles the butterfly of Nabokov's conception and leaves it inert, pinned under a glass screen. </p> <p>Why should this be so? A clue is to be found in Nabokov's 1943 short story, The Assistant Producer, in which the narrator draws a lugubrious parallel between cinema and life, both of which mock the unwary with fatal coincidence. \"Indeterminism is banned from the studio,\" he writes. That is precisely it: the cinema simply cannot maintain creative ambiguity. How do you preserve the master's playful indeterminism when a movie must show one thing or the other? </p> <p>In The Luzhin Defence, for instance, all the chess games are described through metaphors of labyrinths and music. (Though Nabokov himself was an accomplished composer of chess problems, it clearly would have been rebarbative to describe actual games in technical detail.) So here is the hero searching for a move, halfway through his duel for the world championship: \"A kind of musical tempest overwhelmed the board and Luzhin searched stubbornly in it for the tiny, clear note that he needed in order in his turn to swell it out into a thunderous harmony.\" </p> <p>You can't film that. Indeterminism is banned. You have to show the chess pieces moving and their dance must be credible to the chess-literate. The film-makers therefore turned to Jon Speelman, British grandmaster and chess correspondent for the Observer, who provided the sequences of the moves that Luzhin plays in his games, in particular a terrific rook sacrifice that he conceives in the climactic game. It is a splendid half-success. </p> <p>Only a half-success, note, because the film cannot do anything with the complementary way in which chess operates in Nabokov's design: as a fatal pattern creeping into Luzhin's perception of the world and life. Lampposts, bushes and bathroom floors transform into malign knights, pawns and impossible chessboards: they drive him, eventually, mad. Such things cannot be shown on celluloid with any grace. </p> <p>As Nabokov wrote it, The Luzhin Defence is a tour around the unhinging mind of a genius. The reader inhabits Luzhin's consciousness as his own. Luzhin in the film, however, is necessarily externalised, reduced to a collection of mannerisms, no matter how beautifully orchestrated by Turturro. So Gorris's film is forced to switch narrative focus: it is really about not Luzhin but Natalia. She becomes an anachronistically free-spirited modern woman, faced with a choice between two men and following her heart despite the disapproval of her parents. </p> <p>Unfortunately the role of Natalia cannot support this extra weight. Emily Watson clearly struggles to live up to being the film's emotional centre. What was a beautifully structured narrative of mental drama becomes a rather over-familiar costume romance, pillowed by a swooningly sentimental epilogue that has nothing to do with Nabokov's novel. </p> <p>Yet no film-maker approaching the Russian's work has done much better. Stanley Kubrick called his own 1962 version of Lolita, starring James Mason as Humbert Humbert, his \"one manifest failure\". Nabokov himself was hired to write the screenplay, and duly delivered a 400-page manuscript to Kubrick, almost none of which the director used - understandably, as to film a script of such length would have resulted in a six-and-a-half hour movie. (Nabokov retained, however, the sole screenwriting credit, and was nominated for an Oscar.) </p> <p>Nabokov was generous about the film in public, calling it \"charming\". He particularly admired the scene, invented by Kubrick, in which James Mason drinks whisky in the bath after the death of Lolita's mother, giggling to himself while receiving the consolation of mourners. But he remained nostalgic about his own version of the screenplay. \"The film is only a blurred, skimpy glimpse of the marvellous picture I imagined,\" he said later. \"I do not wish to imply that Kubrick's film is mediocre; in its own right, it is first-rate, but it is not what I wrote.\" </p> <p>Kubrick himself eventually acknowledged the major reason for what he saw as the film's failure. He regretted, he said, his \"timidity in translating a novel whose glory was its unique narrative voice\". Indeed, the playfully wheedling, super-refined sensuality of Humbert Humbert's prose is something that cannot be filmed. You certainly do not solve the problem by adding a voiceover, as Adrian Lyne did in his soporific 1997 Lolita: Jeremy Irons strikes one vocal attitude, of wistful, monotonous flatness, and holds it throughout the entire excruciating movie. </p> <p>Nabokov himself evoked his adapters' problem in one marvellous Russian word: \"poshlost\". The word means, as he explained, \"corny trash, vulgar cliches, philistinism in all its phases, imitations of imitations, bogus profundities\". Speaking of Kubrick's Lolita in an interview, he asserted sadly: \"A tinge of poshlost is often given by the cinema to the novel it distorts and coarsens in its crooked glass. Kubrick, I think, avoided this fault in his version, but I shall never understand why he did not follow my directions and dreams.\"</p> <p>Poshlost is also the best diagnosis for other cinematic failures such as Tony Richardson's 1969 film of Laughter in the Dark, in which the action of Nabokov's novel, set in 30s Berlin, is translated by playwright Edward Bond to 60s Swinging London, to egregious effect. Of this film, Nabokov would only say tactfully that Nicol Williamson (who played Albinus) was \"an admirable actor\", and that the sex scenes were \"commonplace\". Jerzy Skolimowski's lurid film of King, Queen, Knave (1972), starring David Niven, fared no better. In his excellent book on Kubrick's Lolita (in the BFI Film Classics series), Richard Corliss excoriates it as \"coarse\", \"inhuman\" and \"clumsy\". </p> <p>The most graphic illustration of the film-maker's impotence in the face of Nabokov's spine-tingling \"indeterminism\", however, comes in Fassbinder's 1978 film of Despair (screenplay by Tom Stoppard). My explanation of this, I'm afraid, has to give away the novel's ending, so if you haven't read it, look away until the end of the paragraph. Still here? Right. Dirk Bogarde plays Hermann Hermann, a chocolatier in prewar Berlin who is bored with his wife. On a business trip abroad, he spies his identical double, and plots to switch lives with him by killing the other man and stealing his identification. The novel's demonic brilliance lies in the fact that only right at the end do we realise that Hermann's \"double\" in fact looks nothing like him: the narrator is simply insane, and he is promptly arrested by the police. In the film, however, the \"double\" has to be shown. He is played by another actor who looks nothing like Bogarde, and we therefore know that Hermann is mad from the inception of his plot. All the story's dramatic tension is lost. </p> <p>What film-maker, indeed, could possibly have avoided all these pitfalls, brought Nabokov's butterflies intact to the screen in all their iridescent, fluttering glory? Well, perhaps there was one. It is to be filed among the great cinematic collaborations that never came to fruition: Nabokov meets Alfred Hitchcock. </p> <p>It is known that the two men admired each other's work. Nabokov commented approvingly that Hitchcock's \"humour noir\" was rather like his own. The two men corresponded, and Hitch asked Nabokov to write the screenplay for what eventually became his 1972 film Frenzy. The novelist, unfortunately, had to decline owing to his work commitments. They never did work together, and Nabokov died in 1977. The rest, as they say, is poshlost.</p> <p>\u0095 The Luzhin Defence is released on September 8.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Football pools operator Zetters yesterday entered the burgeoning spread betting market by agreeing a \u00a320.4m reverse takeover of a US firm that specialises in making markets on financial products. Zetters said it was buying US-based IFX for cash and shares and planned to target largely untapped spread-betting markets in Italy, France, Germany and Turkey. Spread betting is one of the fastest growing forms of gambling and allows punters to bet a range of subjects including share price movements, football scores and political election results. British firms City Index, Financial Spreads and IG Index have all grown to meet demand in recent years, with the latter valued at around \u00a3145m when it floated on the stock market last month. IFX was set up five years ago by Graham Wellesley, a descendent of the Duke of Wellington, and specialises in contracts for difference and spread bets on equity prices. Zetters chairman Tony Wollenberg, one of the original founders of City Index, says IFX will hasten Zetters move away from its traditional and declining business of football pools and into a growth area of online betting. \"IFX has technology that we will be able to adapt to a number of different types of gambling, a proven profits record and strong management,\" he said.",

This weekend, two million revellers are expected to turn up at the 36th Notting Hill carnival. But forget about worrying whether you'll be able to meet up with your friends or if there will be any toilets. The far more demanding issue is the sartorial one, with the revellers in the crowd adopting as much fancy dress as the masqueraders on the floats. </p> <p>The carnival is a Caribbean festival of music, dress, food, drink and dance, so to arrive in your normal conservative style would make you appear the archetypal Englishman abroad and no one wants to look like a tourist in their own home town. The mood is just what you'd expect from a balmy, rum-soaked, relaxed afternoon in west London, so who can blame anyone for immersing themselves in it through their fashion? After all, who wants to party in a pinstripe suit? (It is all too easy, mind you, to get this wrong: distressing memories of William Hague's carnival appearance are only now starting to fade from public memory.) </p> <p>Inevitably, derivatives of Jamaican-influenced fashion (baggy man-made trousers, loose cotton shirts, brown sandals) will make their presence felt along the streets of W11. But far more popular, particularly with those desirous of a little street cred, is the Ghetto Fabulous look: enormous jeans, T-shirts weighted down with logos, fantastically eye-catching trainers. Just think Ali G. </p> <p>\"During carnival, everyone becomes little ragga kids,\" says Waj Hussain, press officer of Proibito, the popular streetwear clothing store that specialises in typically Ghetto Fabulous labels such as Versace Jeans Couture, Iceberg, D&amp;G and Gianfranco Ferre. \"Two years ago, we started getting in special clothes for the carnival, like loud Moschino shirts, lots of bright colours, baggy denim. You know, real 'innit fashion'.\" </p> <p>Which is rather odd considering the Ghetto Fabulous look emerged from the ghettos of New York and Los Angeles more than two decades ago and has little to do with the carnival's Caribbean spirit. Currently experiencing a bit of a fashion renaissance, thanks to Puff Daddy and Missy Elliott, Ghetto Fabulous is characterised by excess: ostentatious labels, enormous jeans and short, tight skirts. </p> <p>Popularised by rap stars in the 80s, the Ghetto Fabulous look was a defiant statement from young, disenfranchised black Americans, demonstrating their financial power and aspirations. Like rap music, the look acquired a kind of street credibility and was quickly adopted by non-black teenagers. </p> <p>\"We definitely get more white kids coming in at carnival time,\" Hussain says. \"All sorts of people want to fit in with this ragga style image - people from across the non-black middle-class spectrum. Everyone gets into the spirit; the whole of London collaborates in this One Nation idea.\" </p> <p>Some might carp that fashion from American inner-city ghettos is not strictly \"One Nation\" with that of Caribbean countries, but this is not the point. The sight of Caucasian teenagers wearing these clothes at the Notting Hill carnival represents the potent allure of that previously marginalised and ignored social group. What was once a plea to be acknowledged has become a powerful fashion statement in its own right. </p> <p>This is particularly apt at the Notting Hill carnival. Like Ghetto Fabulous fashion, the carnival was partly born out of a feeling of ghettoisation. It originated as a reaction to the racism still endemic in Britain in the early 60s and the practical difficulties black people faced, such as lack of work and poor housing, and from the local Caribbean community's desire to bring their traditions to a new country. Hence the arrival of a Trinidad-style carnival, marching and dancing its way through streets with names such as Blenheim Road and Kensington Park Road, the masqueraders dressed up in gloriously opulent and improbably large costumes. </p> <p>In Oval House in south-east London, volunteers at South Connections Band - one of the 60-odd \"bands\" of designers working on this year's carnival costumes - are sewing patterns, shaping wires, rehearsing dance moves and occasionally relaxing over (very brief) cups of tea. Drawings of this year's wildly ornate prospective patterns surround them. </p> <p>\"There are still huge numbers of people at the carnival who remember why they are here: to present a wonderful image of themselves in what was initially a hostile community,\" explains Ros Price, administrator for South Connections Band. \"In carnivals in other parts of the world, where people feel more secure socially, they will make social comment through their clothes and wear rags. In Notting Hill, though, they want to go out looking and feeling a million dollars, which is in itself a social comment.\" </p> <p>And an expensive one at that. To take out a band costs somewhere in the region of \u00a350,000, including material costs, specialist workers, music, transport and the band's running costs. Each chooses a socially and personally significant theme (this year, South Connections Band's theme is Canboulay, a story representing regeneration), then produces around 300 costumes to fit it. </p> <p>\"I know the social situation has changed,\" Price says, \"but it is still very important to the masqueraders to be in the carnival, looking magnificent, making these statements.\" </p> <p>Like Ghetto Fabulous chic, these costumes demand acknowledgement from onlookers and the emphasis is on positivity. As South Connections Band leader Avion Mookram says simply: \"To dress up for the carnival is an expression of cultural pride.\" </p> <p>Rarely has the term \"fashion statement\" been so applicable or literal. Price believes the impact is felt throughout the city, with the success of the carnival increasing the prominence of London's Caribbean community. To see the wondrous costumes drift down Portobello Road, watched by revelling non-black teenagers, dressed to the hilt in rapper style or with dreadlocks and hemp trousers, creates a strange juxtaposition: one shows the proud assertion of cultural pride, the other the adoption into the (white) mainstream of a particular social group's fashion. Both, though, demonstrate the cultural and global diversity that was, after all, the point of the carnival in the first place. </p> <p>But this is all getting very serious. Let's not forget the true point of the carnival: to have fun. As Price says: \"The only real way to take part in the carnival is to be in it and have all of the feeling of being transformed.\" A statement that could easily apply to the masqueraders and spectators alike.

For the past few years, the most photographed outfits on the catwalks of Gucci, Prada and Chloe have been the inspiration for bestsellers in the savviest high street stores. But this season, most of the catwalk trends have been unfriendly to high street interpretation. Prada's sincere chic look, based around knee-length skirts and blouses, pleats and prints, relies on quality materials: reproduced in cheaper fabrics, it has a tendency to look distinctly Littlewoods. It is also a hard look to sell to anyone larger than a size 10 or older than 23 - yes, your bum does look big in that and yes, since you ask, it does make you look 15 years older. </p> <p>So while a few blouses were sold, to hardcore fashion victims like our soya-drinking friend above, summer's real look was something entirely different: denim. Basically, we went shopping, we tried on the blouses, they looked stupid, so we bought a pair of jeans. In every permutation - from bleached, ripped roadie drainpipes to dark, foxy, rhinestone-studded hipsters, to jeans-reincarnated-as-a-skirt, to the ubiquitous Mariah Carey no-waistband look - denim has ruled this summer. </p> <p>Denim for dressing up, rather than dressing down, has been one of the major fashion stories of the past few years.

And the good news is that while those blouses looked like old news before they were even on the sale rail, denim is set to be bigger than ever for autumn, with new ranges, by designers from Alexander McQueen to Chanel, sure to keep the fasherati in lust with denim.

In keeping with the ironic, fanzine post-Hornby idiom, supporting a faintly hopeless football team is turned into a metonym for life's uphill struggle. Manchester City is the team in question - this project evidently conceived before their triumphant re-entry into the Premiership.</p> <p>Newcomer Lewis McKenzie plays 15-year-old Jimmy Grimble, a loyal Man City fan in a school full of glory-chasing Man U prats. (The Protestant/Catholic dimension of the teams' rivalry is, incidentally, unmentioned.

In keeping with the ironic, fanzine post-Hornby idiom, supporting a faintly hopeless football team is turned into a metonym for life's uphill struggle. Manchester City is the team in question - this project evidently conceived before their triumphant re-entry into the Premiership. Newcomer Lewis McKenzie plays 15-year-old Jimmy Grimble, a loyal Man City fan in a school full of glory-chasing Man U prats. (The Protestant/Catholic dimension of the teams' rivalry is, incidentally, unmentioned. Also unmentioned, oddly, are any gags about the Gallagher brothers or Francis Lee and his toilet paper.)

      "body": "<p>As the Film Council announces the names of the professionals in charge of running their multimillion pound fund for the cinema, the industry is divided between relief and bewilderment.</p> <p>Relief to know that two independent producers, Robert Jones and Paul Trijbits, have been chosen to run the production funds for commercial and new films and that Jenny Borgars, a well-respected figure, will run the script development fund. And bewilderment about its burgeoning bureaucracy. My interview with the Film Council's chief executive officer, John Wood ward, will do little to reassure them. </p> <p><strong>Agnes Poirier: </strong>Having been director of PACT (Producers' Alliance for Cinema &amp; Television) the BFI (British Film Institute), here you are at the head of the Film Council, set up to centralise all the means of public support for film. You and your chairman, Alan Parker, recently announced your desire to finance mainly big budget films. Why? </p> <p><strong>John Woodward:</strong> Because times have changed. Because it's pointless to go on handing out thousands of small amounts of money to small films that will struggle to find a distributor and be seen in cinemas. Because there is always a bigger chance of getting a return on an investment in a higher-budget film. Big films are more likely to go wide and repay the money put into them, it's as simple as that.</p> <p>Nowadays, it no longer makes sense to marginalise public support by confining it to a small group of independent producers and directors, who will make films that no one will want or be able to see. Film-making is a business like any other, the fact that we are dealing with public money should not affect our policy towards providing assistance and finance. </p> <p> <strong>AP:</strong> So you plan to invest in films in the same way as a private sector investor would </p> <p> <strong>JW: </strong>Yes, there's no difference between the Film Council and the mini-studios that exist in Britain, such as FilmFour, Momentum, Redbus, Renaissance, Sky Pictures, Intermedia. We are not dirigistes, as you are in France. Public money should be invested prudently, just like private money. We are not prepared to take unnecessary risks.</p> <p>In recent years very few films backed by Lottery money have succeeded in repaying the Arts Council of England. It's time that changed. We shall finance fewer films, but in a more meaningful way. </p> <p> <strong>AP:</strong> You have closed down the European Co-production Fund, managed up to now by British Screen. Does this signal the end of British support for European films that are not made in English ? </p> <p> <strong>JW: </strong>The European Co-production Fund has worked well over the 15 years since its inception. But the film industry no longer works in the same way. One must learn to adapt. We are certainly not prepared, nowadays, to support small art films with a tough, social subject-matter or European foreign-language films, which won't find a distributor in Britain. We have to accept the fact that the British public goes to see, 85% of the time, American films.

      "bodyText": "As the Film Council announces the names of the professionals in charge of running their multimillion pound fund for the cinema, the industry is divided between relief and bewilderment. Relief to know that two independent producers, Robert Jones and Paul Trijbits, have been chosen to run the production funds for commercial and new films and that Jenny Borgars, a well-respected figure, will run the script development fund. And bewilderment about its burgeoning bureaucracy. My interview with the Film Council's chief executive officer, John Wood ward, will do little to reassure them. Agnes Poirier: Having been director of PACT (Producers' Alliance for Cinema &amp; Television) the BFI (British Film Institute), here you are at the head of the Film Council, set up to centralise all the means of public support for film. You and your chairman, Alan Parker, recently announced your desire to finance mainly big budget films. Why? John Woodward: Because times have changed. Because it's pointless to go on handing out thousands of small amounts of money to small films that will struggle to find a distributor and be seen in cinemas. Because there is always a bigger chance of getting a return on an investment in a higher-budget film. Big films are more likely to go wide and repay the money put into them, it's as simple as that. Nowadays, it no longer makes sense to marginalise public support by confining it to a small group of independent producers and directors, who will make films that no one will want or be able to see. Film-making is a business like any other, the fact that we are dealing with public money should not affect our policy towards providing assistance and finance. AP: So you plan to invest in films in the same way as a private sector investor would JW: Yes, there's no difference between the Film Council and the mini-studios that exist in Britain, such as FilmFour, Momentum, Redbus, Renaissance, Sky Pictures, Intermedia. We are not dirigistes, as you are in France. Public money should be invested prudently, just like private money. We are not prepared to take unnecessary risks. In recent years very few films backed by Lottery money have succeeded in repaying the Arts Council of England. It's time that changed. We shall finance fewer films, but in a more meaningful way. AP: You have closed down the European Co-production Fund, managed up to now by British Screen. Does this signal the end of British support for European films that are not made in English ? JW: The European Co-production Fund has worked well over the 15 years since its inception. But the film industry no longer works in the same way. One must learn to adapt. We are certainly not prepared, nowadays, to support small art films with a tough, social subject-matter or European foreign-language films, which won't find a distributor in Britain. We have to accept the fact that the British public goes to see, 85% of the time, American films. We have, however, set a target: 20% of each of our funds will be deployed in European co-productions. AP: Can you tell us how the 20% allocation will operate ? JW: For the moment it's simply a target. The allocation is not a fund in itself, and so for the time being, there are no specific strategies for its implementation. If the political will exists, then the target will be met. AP: A lack of political will in favour of European co-productions is precisely what the Film Council is criticised for in some quarters. How do you respond to that ? JW: Once again, times have changed. Britain stands apart from the rest of Europe, notably by virtue of its language, which it shares with the United States. This is both a blessing and a curse.

Outside the canteen of a Copenhagen film company, there's a screech of tyres and a blur of scarlet as a freshly waxed Alfa Romeo careers past the window, shuddering to a halt 50 yards from where it started. It's the kind of car teenage boys dream about, open-top, brilliant red, more-than-faintly phallic: a car for men with a sense of flash. Or joyriders. </p> <p>And out steps Lars von Trier, the 44-year-old enfant terrible of European cinema, director of such contentious landmarks as Breaking The Waves and The Idiots, \"chief rabbi\" of Dogme 5. Here he comes, with his DIY haircut and his shapeless T-shirt, scratching his stubble, beaming excitably.</p> <p>The car's new, says his vaguely weary assistant, a gift from a dealership in exchange for some publicity shots. So now Lars von Trier drives a bright red, brazenly penile Alfa Romeo convertible. The word, you feel, is incongruous. Which is also the word for his latest feature, Dancer In The Dark. Because Dancer In The Dark is hardly your average movie: in fact, it isn't even your average Lars von Trier movie. </p> <p>The story of Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker in the midwest who escapes her epic suffering though a passion for show tunes, it's a classic melodrama - an act of God here, an abject betrayal there - allied to an innovative musical, all filtered through its director's handheld video camera.</p> <p>A harrowing masterpiece with choreography by Madonna's hoofing coach, it made me - for all the best reasons - cry. It might make you cry too. Then again, it could make you sick. You may find Bj\u00f6rk's central performance heartbreaking; you may feel swindled and violated. It's possible you'll fall in love with it. There's every chance you'll really, truly hate it. </p> <p>Von Trier didn't have the Alfa Romeo when he was making it: instead, he shuttled comically around the set in his army buggy. When the time came for this year's Cannes film festival, however, he opted for civilian transport, arriving on the Riveira in his ageing camper van.</p> <p>Maybe you heard about Cannes. Maybe you heard about von Trier winning the Palme d'Or, and the movie's gala screening. Barely had the closing credits begun before the place erupted in ecstatic applause. Then it erupted in violent jeers. Then they just erupted together, a standing ovation with a side order of outrage. It's that kind of film. </p> <p>In his office, the Palme d'Or propped up against a sofa, we smalltalk before I tell him veteran critics who were there say they've never seen anything like it. His eyes light up; if anyone could ever be said to twinkle mischievously, it's Lars von Trier. \"Oh, but that is fine. I think that if people react at all, then\" - he breaks out in a smirk - \"you've reached the parts that Heineken cannot get to.\"</p> <p>So he wouldn't have preferred the applause without the catcalls? \"No, if it was only applause I would feel even more at the end of my career than I do already. Because the more everybody likes what you do, the less reason there is to do it. No, booing is fine. I'm quite happy with booing.\" </p> <p>About now you remember you're talking to someone who once suggested a film should be \"like a rock in the shoe\". \"Oh yes, I stand by that,\" he says. \"Except now it's a Prozac in the shoe.\" </p> <p>This may ring a bell. The last time this newspaper spoke to von Trier, he was raving over the wonder pill for alleviating his legion phobias. Two years on, he's still smitten. \"Ah, Prozac... when you break the capsule and you have the sweet powder, aaaah. Yes, I love to have some in my pocket, and pull my hand out and there's that sweet smell.\"</p> <p>He stares at me, suddenly weirdly earnest. \"You don't use Prozac?\" No, I don't. He gives me the look of a man who believes it's entirely my loss. \"Well, I've been taking it for several years now, and I still think it's a good drug. I mean, before I had such anxiety that I couldn't leave my room, and now I can even go to Cannes...\" The smirk returns. \"And get booed.\" </p> <p>It's true: the von Trier of old could never have handled the furore so calmly. This time he had a different obstacle: Bj\u00f6rk, who tried to have the screening cancelled over \"musical differences\" (she later won the award for best actress). In response, he called her a madwoman, a remark not untypical of their relationship. On set, so the story goes, he would cajole, she - without prior acting experience - break down; he would push, she call the lawyers. So, Lars, let's talk about Bj\u00f6rk. </p> <p>\"Bj\u00f6rk?\" he deadpans. \"Bj\u00f6rk? I know many Bj\u00f6rks. Do you have a specific one in mind?\" Yup: the singing one. The star of your film. Bj\u00f6rk Gudmundsdottir. \"Ah, good old Gudmundsdottir! Yes, I remember.\" He rubs his belly reflectively. \"You know, when we were filming, it was actually quite good. As people on our way to work and from work, we had a bad time, but with the camera running, it was the closest I have been to an actor...\" There's something else; he's trying not to laugh. \"When we were filming, I was inside her. Will you make sure to write that? I was inside her.\" </p> <p>Meet a man who knows journalists. But if they had such an affinity, why the arguments and tantrums? Arguments and tantrums, it should be noted, of reputedly biblical proportions. \"Well, it wasn't so much arguments, it was more that she felt the pain of the story very personally. It was like having some poor animal in a film that felt tortured just being there. And that was unpleasant, yes. The thing was, I could have taken her where she needed to go, and helped her get back, but... that never happened.\" </p> <p>Among the various yarns, one stands out. His eyes widen disingenuously. The costume eating? \"Ah, I wasn't there. But I understand she did harm to her costume, yes.\" With her teeth? \"I was not there. But I understand there was a problem with finding bits of a costume that Bj\u00f6rk had done harm to. Off-screen.\" By now, he's almost convulsing with the effort of keeping a straight face, the need for diplomacy. \"Well, there's no reason not to be diplomatic. I understand her pain. But I must say, if it had been me that ate a blouse, I would be quite proud. And I'm not saying that she ate a blouse...\" </p> <p>He gives in, laughing hard. \"But if she ate a blouse, I don't think she would be proud. Me, if something drove me to eat a blouse, I would tell the world.\" The mood only changes when I ask what he's learned from it all. His gaze settles on the corner of the room. \"Nothing.\" He frowns inquisitively. \"No, I think, unfortunately, both of us have walked away from this as not better human beings. I think that's what happens. You don't get better. On the other hand, I'm quite content with the results, so...\" He trails off. \"But I'm sorry if Bj\u00f6rk has scars. I have scars too.\" </p> <p>His phone rings. He takes the call, talks for less than a minute, then returns to the couch. It was his wife, asking if he wants an ISDN line \"so I can dowload filth faster\". A conversation about internet porn ensues, none of which is strictly relevant save him feigning shock at my prudery: \"Come on! You should love the internet! The English are the filthiest people in the world.\" I try to get him back on to the film. </p> <p>\"So yes, Bj\u00f6rk said I was a sadistic arsehole...\" Actually, I wanted to talk about its status as the most high-profile musical in decades, laden as it is with Selma's all-singing, all-dancing reveries. Although it works because it's played so straight, he must have seen the danger of seeming arch.</p> <p>\"Yes, yes, yes,\" he nods. \"But the genre can be so strong that you don't need to parody it. These were films I loved as a child, but that doesn't mean I have to distance myself from them...\" The phone rings again. Flapping slightly, he curses - I think - in Danish. \"So it was very important to make Selma a character people could care about,\" he gabbles, lifting the receiver, \"and where it was clear music was so important to her that it wouldn't seem artificial... Hello?\" </p> <p>There's another hiatus. Afterwards, he unplugs the phone. \"Something about the kids. As someone with four, I must tell you that if you have them one by one, it's very nice. Otherwise, you must be the policeman, which is not particularly interesting or we would have been policemen, wouldn't we?\" </p> <p>Childhood and parenting: familiar ground for von Trier. Anyone sceptical of Dancer In The Dark's ripened melodrama would surely blanch at its director's biography. First came the upbringing by stalwart communists, left wholly free of adult interference (the inspiration, he says, for most of his phobias).</p> <p>Then the clincher: his mother's deathbed confession in 1995 that her late husband was not his biological father. He met the real thing four times before the old man cut off contact. Within a year, von Trier left his first wife, converted to Catholicism (hitherto believing he was Jewish), and made Breaking The Waves, the film which began his departure from the polite sensibilities of his early career (dazzlingly unhinged hospital soap The Kingdom notwithstanding). </p> <p>Now he lives in the suburbs with his second wife and is, by all accounts - except perhaps Bj\u00f6rk's - a model of adjustment. He peers at his feet. \"You know, it's an interesting power, your upbringing. Of course, family is important, but we should also remember it is the root of conflict. We have this craving for a home, this animal urge you can't control in an intellectual way, and while you can be logical and...\" He looks up, genuinely puzzled. \"Why am I trying to be clever about this? Ask me about the film.\" </p> <p>So I do: specifically, I ask about the controversy which follows his career like a lost dog. For every viewer who found the sexual extremities of Breaking the Waves redemptive, someone else was walking out in dumbstruck horror; The Idiots, meanwhile, dealt with physical handicap and erections: enough said. And now there's Dancer In The Dark, already condemned as emotional pornography (actually, that was one of Bj\u00f6rk's). For the only time while I'm with him, he seems indifferent. \"Yeah. OK. People can say that. Of course, in truth, I'm a poor softie...\" </p> <p>Only he's not a softie to those vexed by what they see as the hallmark of his last three films: sacrificial women. His expression hovers somewhere indefinite. \"Ah, I never knew the word.\" Misogyny? \"Right. And precisely it means...?\" Hating women. \"Uh-huh. OK.\" He gives the matter what looks like serious thought. \"No, I don't think there's hatred.\" Now there's a glint in his eye. \"I mean, firstly my mother was a woman...\" And did you like your mother, Lars? I'm expecting a punchline. Instead, his brow furrows. </p> <p>\"I don't know if... I respected her very much. Liked her, yeah, I suppose. I mean, it wasn't an uncomplicated relationship. But I don't think these are representatives of real women. They're characters from my own female side. And hating or belittling women, that's not my intention. I see them as the stronger sex, because they're unpredictable.\"</p> <p>Panic spreads across his face. \"That does sound belittling.\" He holds his head in his hands. \"I'm sorry... oh, wouldn't life be better if it was just men and the internet?\" And then he smiles and says \"I think she won.\" Who? Bj\u00f6rk? \"Yes. I think she won. I remember telling someone in my family about her, and they were saying 'Oh Lars, how terrible', and then they saw the film and said 'Shame on you!' And I said what? And they said 'Shame on you! This woman is a saint. A saint!' \" </p> <p>Speaking of which, how's the Catholicism working out? He screws up his nose. \"Oh, it's not. I don't know, it seems like this God wants us to kneel. Which I don't find logical. I mean, if his creation is so great, why does he want us on our knees? I'm sure I'll be punished in the afterlife for saying that. Or no,\" - there's some hardcore twinkling going on - \"And shame on you! Of course, Bj\u00f6rk will have some studio there, with her rappers running around. And I'll say, OK, I'll take hell instead.\" </p> <p>Grinning the same artless grin he wore when he first walked in, Lars von Trier gestures through his office window, on into the outside world. \"And in the meantime, I have this fantastic car. What more could I want?\"</p> <p>\u0095 Dancer in the Dark is released on September 15.</p>",

It was like having some poor animal in a film that felt tortured just being there. And that was unpleasant, yes. The thing was, I could have taken her where she needed to go, and helped her get back, but... that never happened.\" Among the various yarns, one stands out. His eyes widen disingenuously. The costume eating? \"Ah, I wasn't there. But I understand she did harm to her costume, yes.\" With her teeth? \"I was not there. But I understand there was a problem with finding bits of a costume that Bj\u00f6rk had done harm to. Off-screen.\" By now, he's almost convulsing with the effort of keeping a straight face, the need for diplomacy. \"Well, there's no reason not to be diplomatic. I understand her pain. But I must say, if it had been me that ate a blouse, I would be quite proud. And I'm not saying that she ate a blouse...\" He gives in, laughing hard. \"But if she ate a blouse, I don't think she would be proud. Me, if something drove me to eat a blouse, I would tell the world.\" The mood only changes when I ask what he's learned from it all. His gaze settles on the corner of the room. \"Nothing.\" He frowns inquisitively. \"No, I think, unfortunately, both of us have walked away from this as not better human beings. I think that's what happens. You don't get better. On the other hand, I'm quite content with the results, so...\" He trails off. \"But I'm sorry if Bj\u00f6rk has scars. I have scars too.\" His phone rings. He takes the call, talks for less than a minute, then returns to the couch. It was his wife, asking if he wants an ISDN line \"so I can dowload filth faster\". A conversation about internet porn ensues, none of which is strictly relevant save him feigning shock at my prudery: \"Come on! You should love the internet! The English are the filthiest people in the world.\" I try to get him back on to the film. \"So yes, Bj\u00f6rk said I was a sadistic arsehole...\" Actually, I wanted to talk about its status as the most high-profile musical in decades, laden as it is with Selma's all-singing, all-dancing reveries. Although it works because it's played so straight, he must have seen the danger of seeming arch. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he nods. \"But the genre can be so strong that you don't need to parody it. These were films I loved as a child, but that doesn't mean I have to distance myself from them...\" The phone rings again. Flapping slightly, he curses - I think - in Danish. \"So it was very important to make Selma a character people could care about,\" he gabbles, lifting the receiver, \"and where it was clear music was so important to her that it wouldn't seem artificial... Hello?\" There's another hiatus. Afterwards, he unplugs the phone. \"Something about the kids. As someone with four, I must tell you that if you have them one by one, it's very nice. Otherwise, you must be the policeman, which is not particularly interesting or we would have been policemen, wouldn't we?\" Childhood and parenting: familiar ground for von Trier. Anyone sceptical of Dancer In The Dark's ripened melodrama would surely blanch at its director's biography. First came the upbringing by stalwart communists, left wholly free of adult interference (the inspiration, he says, for most of his phobias). Then the clincher: his mother's deathbed confession in 1995 that her late husband was not his biological father. He met the real thing four times before the old man cut off contact. Within a year, von Trier left his first wife, converted to Catholicism (hitherto believing he was Jewish), and made Breaking The Waves, the film which began his departure from the polite sensibilities of his early career (dazzlingly unhinged hospital soap The Kingdom notwithstanding). Now he lives in the suburbs with his second wife and is, by all accounts - except perhaps Bj\u00f6rk's - a model of adjustment. He peers at his feet. \"You know, it's an interesting power, your upbringing. Of course, family is important, but we should also remember it is the root of conflict. We have this craving for a home, this animal urge you can't control in an intellectual way, and while you can be logical and...\" He looks up, genuinely puzzled. \"Why am I trying to be clever about this? Ask me about the film.\" So I do: specifically, I ask about the controversy which follows his career like a lost dog. For every viewer who found the sexual extremities of Breaking the Waves redemptive, someone else was walking out in dumbstruck horror; The Idiots, meanwhile, dealt with physical handicap and erections: enough said. And now there's Dancer In The Dark, already condemned as emotional pornography (actually, that was one of Bj\u00f6rk's). For the only time while I'm with him, he seems indifferent. \"Yeah. OK. People can say that. Of course, in truth, I'm a poor softie...\" Only he's not a softie to those vexed by what they see as the hallmark of his last three films: sacrificial women. His expression hovers somewhere indefinite. \"Ah, I never knew the word.\" Misogyny? \"Right. And precisely it means...?\" Hating women. \"Uh-huh. OK.\" He gives the matter what looks like serious thought. \"No, I don't think there's hatred.\" Now there's a glint in his eye. \"I mean, firstly my mother was a woman...\" And did you like your mother, Lars? I'm expecting a punchline. Instead, his brow furrows. \"I don't know if... I respected her very much. Liked her, yeah, I suppose. I mean, it wasn't an uncomplicated relationship. But I don't think these are representatives of real women. They're characters from my own female side. And hating or belittling women, that's not my intention. I see them as the stronger sex, because they're unpredictable.\" Panic spreads across his face. \"That does sound belittling.\" He holds his head in his hands. \"I'm sorry... oh, wouldn't life be better if it was just men and the internet?\" And then he smiles and says \"I think she won.\" Who? Bj\u00f6rk? \"Yes. I think she won. I remember telling someone in my family about her, and they were saying 'Oh Lars, how terrible', and then they saw the film and said 'Shame on you!' And I said what? And they said 'Shame on you! This woman is a saint. A saint!' \" Speaking of which, how's the Catholicism working out? He screws up his nose. \"Oh, it's not. I don't know, it seems like this God wants us to kneel. Which I don't find logical. I mean, if his creation is so great, why does he want us on our knees? I'm sure I'll be punished in the afterlife for saying that. Or no,\" - there's some hardcore twinkling going on - \"And shame on you! Of course, Bj\u00f6rk will have some studio there, with her rappers running around. And I'll say, OK, I'll take hell instead.\" Grinning the same artless grin he wore when he first walked in, Lars von Trier gestures through his office window, on into the outside world. \"And in the meantime, I have this fantastic car. What more could I want?\" \u0095 Dancer in the Dark is released on September 15.",

      "body": "<p>Meet Mark and Michael. Mark is the one on the left in black with the ghostly face and shorter hair. Michael is the other one. I think. Michael and Mark Polish, as in the country. The Polish twins star in and have written and directed their first film, Twin Falls Idaho. Well, actually Michael did the directing, while Mark did the writing.</p> <p>The film is about a pair of twins who are inseparable, in every sense. They think alike, talk alike, share the same interests, the same body. The Siamese twins hold on tight to each other to protect themselves against a prying, cruel world. They seek refuge in a surreal hotel with twisted staircases, dropping ceilings and invisible doors. Twin Falls Idaho is a gentle and creepy love story that wouldn't look out of place in David Lynch's portfolio. </p> <p>We meet in a club that could have been modelled on the hotel. I bend my back up the stairs, am led through an invisible door and find the twins waiting for me by a warm fire. They dress almost identically. I feel as if I'm trapped in a spot-the-difference competition (Aha! Michael is wearing snazzy trainers, Mark's in black shoes.) </p> <p>Michael plays the weaker character, Francis. Funny, says Michael, in real life Mark is the weaker one. As a child, his appendix exploded, and as a young man he had a motorbike accident that left him with broken femur, tibia, fibia, wrists, ribs. Unfortunately, Michael explains, Mark was too weak to play Francis (his legs weren't up to it) so he had to play Blake, the stronger character. </p> <p>The twins, 28, start gabbling to each other, quietly and affectionately. I feel like a gooseberry. They talk about the hit-and-run accident that left Mark out of action for 18 months. \"I can't remember if I heard and I started limping or if I was limping before I heard about it,\" says Michael.</p> <p>\"But I remember seeing him in the hospital, I actually beat the ambulance to the hospital. He was coming in and I saw his leg and it was that big, like elephantiasis or something. I thought this is sick, this is bad. He couldn't see his own leg, and then my leg started going numb, and I remember thinking, 'Boy this is sick.' I can't tell you if this was being a twin or just being empathetic.\" </p> <p>The twins say that was unusual, they don't normally feel every twinge and prick the other experiences. They feel perfectly confident in their own identities and abilities. Michael is the visual artist, Mark the writer. </p> <p>\"We have different chins, and different hair, and different noses, and our eyes are different. Physically,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"Yeah, physically,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"Yeah, physically, we're different,\" says Michael. </p> <p>The twins have a slightly dysfunctional bent, an anorak quality common to many film-makers. Perhaps it comes from too much life experienced secondhand in the dark. \"I'm shyer,\" says Michael. \"I'll definitely avoid the public more. He won't seek it out, but he's more comfortable in it.\" </p> <p>As children, they would skip schools, hop on their bikes and go to the movies. They talk about great films they've seen - all sorts from Mad Max and Dr Zhivago, to Saturday Night Fever. None of them remotely like the film they've made. </p> <p>Polish by name, American by nationality, with Mexican and Austrian blood running deep in their veins, they were raised in California. After school, Michael went to LA to study art, Mark followed a year or so later to audition for acting parts he never got. What drew them to the arts? They answer in unison. </p> <p>\"Shit!\" </p> <p>\"Fuck!!\" </p> <p> \"GOD!!!\" </p> <p>\"We were bored, just retarded.\" </p> <p>\"Bored! We lived in a very small community.\" Mark says at school only one out of eight hours a day was dedicated to art, and it frustrated them. </p> <p>Michael says Twin Falls Idaho is influenced by paintings rather than film. Perhaps if Rembrandt and Max Ernst had collaborated on a movie they might have come up with something like this. The film's painterly look defies its $500,000 budget. Yes, says, Michael painterly is the word. \"Paint is an ally. It changes the mood immediately. A lot of independent films don't take the sets into consideration. I mean you paint the walls rather than keep them white. You do set decoration.\" </p> <p>\"A gallon of paint only costs $24,\" says Mark. </p> <p>Twin Falls Idaho is a complicated love story. The couple turn into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when the stronger brother, Blake, falls in love with a woman. The relationship is handled with great delicacy - they only kiss when Francis is asleep. Mark says in the end the overwheming love is between the brothers, both of whom will sacrifice everything for the other. </p> <p>The film is largely about the brothers looking out on the world, and witnessing a freak show rather than the other way round. Initially, says Michael, they weren't interested in how the world saw them. But gradually, as they were shooting the film, they realised it would fail to reflect reality if they didn't occasionally show the world staring them in the faces.</p> <p>\"We thought people were past that kind of stuff, but when we were doing a photo shoot there were a couple of dozen people just staring at us.\" When it came to the more tricky Siamese scenes - playing the guitar together, fighting, having an affair - no one involved on the set could stay away. The brothers may not have wanted to make a film about voyeurism, but in the end they realised that had to be part of the story. </p> <p>Did they feel like freaks? </p> <p>\"No,\" says Michael. </p> <p>\"No,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"But I did think shit, this is the daily thing they go through...\" </p> <p>\"And I think Francis's character started to evolve into someone who always turned from the people staring at him.\" </p> <p>They both talk about the way strangers feel they have a claim on twins; the right to know; how they ask questions they would never presume to ask of other people - how were you born, who's older, do you feel strange when you're apart? </p> <p>It can be funny, they say when people realise they are intruding but can't help themselves anyway. \"Sometimes they're nervous and they're juddering, and they start talking about their cousins or uncles who are twins and you find out they're revealing much more about themselves than they'll ever get from you.\" </p> <p>I realise I am staring at them in exactly the same way. God knows which one is speaking. </p> <p>\"Mark's chin is a little thinner,\" says Michael by way of a reminder. </p> <p>\"Yes, thinner,\" says Mark. </p> <p>They tell me about their separate lives. Both boys have long-term partners. Mark has a little girl called Jasper, Michael has a boxer called Dulcey. </p> <p>Despite their geeky diffidence, the twins know exactly what they want out of life. \"We are very passionate about making a great film,\" says Michael. Is Twin Falls Idaho the great film they are talking about? </p> <p>\"Oh no!\" exclaims an appalled Michael. </p> <p>\"Oh no!\" echoes his brother with an extra notch of anguish. \"This is a serious 12-step programme. We've got so far to go. I just see it now as flawed as hell.\" They say they don't want to tell me why they're disappointed with this fine film, but they can't resist. </p> <p>\"I think the pacing is a little slow,\" says Michael. </p> <p>\"To me why it is so flawed...\" Mark takes a deep breath and says how originally when it was first written the movie was going to have an epic sweep like Once Upon a Time in America. Not surprisingly, they didn't have the cash to make that film. </p> <p>\"In the next film, you'll see the real talent,\" says Mark. \"Michael will be behind the camera, conceiving.\" The next film is about a concrete dam that floods a town. Mark says Warner Brothers loved it, wanted to make it, but realised it didn't make financial sense - the brothers wanted to spend a maximum $3m making the movie, while Warners would spend a minimum $15m marketing it. They took the script to other studios who told them it was a bit different, a bit too different. When Mark was told there's nothing quite like that out there, he initially thought it was meant as a compliment. He pauses, baffled by Hollywood logic. \"...But then that's what they said about Twin Falls Idaho.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Twin Falls Idaho is released next Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Turning points are generally more obvious in retrospect than when they take place, but if Al Gore wins the race for the White House this November, then he is going to look back to these middle days of August as the moment when the tide turned in his favour.</p> <p>Things began looking up for Gore when he chose Joe Lieberman as his running mate. They got better when Gore exceeded expectations in his acceptance speech to the Democratic convention last week.</p> <p>That passionate kiss with his wife Tipper before the start of his speech was the most noticed event of the convention season. Now, in the week since the Los Angeles convention, Gore has taken the political contest to George W Bush for the first time, and has been rewarded both by signs of Republican vulnerability and by a healthy boost in the opinion polls. Returning to the campaign trail after the traditional pause during his opponent's convention, George W Bush has failed to find his rhythm.</p> <p>After months as the frontrunner, perhaps he has become complacent, but the contrast between Bush's light schedule this week and Gore's strong campaigning performance in the Midwest and Florida has been palpable.</p> <p>Bush did not quite seem to have his heart in it. He seemed too relaxed, talking too readily about enjoying his week off. He has fumbled his words. Worst of all, he has let Gore dictate the agenda.</p> <p>Bush had intended these last days of summer campaigning to be about education. With schools and colleges about to reassemble for the new academic year, education is on many Americans' minds.</p> <p>Gore made two solid, focused pitches on the subject this week - the first on pre-school education, the second on tax breaks for the parents of college students.</p> <p>But Bush found himself pushed off the subject, forced to defend remarks on American military readiness that suddenly seemed mean-spirited, compelled to issue repeated clarifications on his tax plans, and wrong-footed over an attack ad against Gore which was hastily withdrawn on Wednesday.</p> <p>Bush was in the quintessential middle America town of Peoria, Illinois, this week when he made what could be the most damaging mistake of the three.</p> <p>Conscious that his $1.6 trillion (\u00a31.1 trillion) tax cut continues to be seen as a rich man's charter by the Democrats - as it was in the spring by John McCain - Bush sought out a group of the travelling press corps to try to explain his plans in more favourable detail.</p> <p>The result was a spectacular own goal, full of non sequiturs and opacity, which required urgent rescue work by Bush aides as the day wore on.</p> <p>\"I've got to do a better job of making it clear,\" Bush told the reporters, \"that starting with a baseline of about $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years, the budgets will increase by about $3.3 trillion. And yet you've still got another $2.3 trillion of surplus. I think that when people understand that we've got a lot of money that we'll apply to different programmes, that the tax relief package will become even more, people will buy into the tax relief package even more.\"</p> <p>Got that? No? Well, the reporters didn't either. The whole episode triggered a distinctly unfavourable couple of days of coverage for Bush, not at all what the high command was looking for.</p> <p>Mockery has begun to edge out respect in the coverage of the Bush campaign. \"Reactive and not entirely coherent,\" reported the New York Times.</p> <p>Anyone can have a bad week, of course, but this is a bad time to have one.</p> <p>Gore is suddenly on form.

      "bodyText": "Turning points are generally more obvious in retrospect than when they take place, but if Al Gore wins the race for the White House this November, then he is going to look back to these middle days of August as the moment when the tide turned in his favour. Things began looking up for Gore when he chose Joe Lieberman as his running mate. They got better when Gore exceeded expectations in his acceptance speech to the Democratic convention last week. That passionate kiss with his wife Tipper before the start of his speech was the most noticed event of the convention season. Now, in the week since the Los Angeles convention, Gore has taken the political contest to George W Bush for the first time, and has been rewarded both by signs of Republican vulnerability and by a healthy boost in the opinion polls. Returning to the campaign trail after the traditional pause during his opponent's convention, George W Bush has failed to find his rhythm. After months as the frontrunner, perhaps he has become complacent, but the contrast between Bush's light schedule this week and Gore's strong campaigning performance in the Midwest and Florida has been palpable. Bush did not quite seem to have his heart in it. He seemed too relaxed, talking too readily about enjoying his week off. He has fumbled his words. Worst of all, he has let Gore dictate the agenda. Bush had intended these last days of summer campaigning to be about education. With schools and colleges about to reassemble for the new academic year, education is on many Americans' minds. Gore made two solid, focused pitches on the subject this week - the first on pre-school education, the second on tax breaks for the parents of college students. But Bush found himself pushed off the subject, forced to defend remarks on American military readiness that suddenly seemed mean-spirited, compelled to issue repeated clarifications on his tax plans, and wrong-footed over an attack ad against Gore which was hastily withdrawn on Wednesday. Bush was in the quintessential middle America town of Peoria, Illinois, this week when he made what could be the most damaging mistake of the three. Conscious that his $1.6 trillion (\u00a31.1 trillion) tax cut continues to be seen as a rich man's charter by the Democrats - as it was in the spring by John McCain - Bush sought out a group of the travelling press corps to try to explain his plans in more favourable detail. The result was a spectacular own goal, full of non sequiturs and opacity, which required urgent rescue work by Bush aides as the day wore on. \"I've got to do a better job of making it clear,\" Bush told the reporters, \"that starting with a baseline of about $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years, the budgets will increase by about $3.3 trillion. And yet you've still got another $2.3 trillion of surplus. I think that when people understand that we've got a lot of money that we'll apply to different programmes, that the tax relief package will become even more, people will buy into the tax relief package even more.\" Got that? No? Well, the reporters didn't either. The whole episode triggered a distinctly unfavourable couple of days of coverage for Bush, not at all what the high command was looking for. Mockery has begun to edge out respect in the coverage of the Bush campaign. \"Reactive and not entirely coherent,\" reported the New York Times. Anyone can have a bad week, of course, but this is a bad time to have one. Gore is suddenly on form. He had already taken the lead in the national polls even before Los Angeles - the Lieberman factor presumably - and he has pushed further ahead this week. Yesterday, four new polls in important states all showed Gore ahead of Bush - by two points in Michigan, by eight in Minnesota, by 12 in New Jersey, and by 13 in California. And Gore and Lieberman spent Wednesday in Florida, where the choice of Jewish Joe has ignited fierce enthusiasm among the Jewish retiree vote who make up 6% of the state's electorate. Suddenly, Bush is on the defensive. There are nearly 80 days to go, of course, so this is just the start. Nevertheless, Bush is looking rattled on two other looming issues - the presidential debates, where he is squirming to avoid traditional stand-up contests in favour of cosy chats with Larry King round a TV studio table, and the congressional budget negotiations on Capitol Hill, where Bill Clinton is quietly playing a unnoticed blinder, manoeuvring the Republican leadership into a confrontation which resurrects all the associations that Bush is desperate to keep well buried until November 7. Election day is still a long way off. But Labour Day, traditional start of the real campaign, is just 10 days distant. In all but two of the presidential contests since opinion polling began in 1936, the candidate who led on Labour Day was the candidate who won two months later on election day (the exceptions were Truman in 1948 and Kennedy in 1960). Rules are there to be broken, but right now, it looks as though Bush could be trailing on September 4 and that Al Gore will be the favourite after all.",

      "bodyText": "The distraught mother of a dead Russian sailor moved centre stage in the Kursk submarine drama yesterday as the symbol of national grief at the loss of 118 seamen and the Russian authorities' response. Local television showed the woman being involuntarily sedated by injection as she abused a deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, who heads the inquiry into the disaster. She blamed navy chiefs and the government for her son's death. Examination of the footage, said to be filmed by local television in the northern port of Murmansk, revealed that the screaming woman collapsed after a medic apparently administered a sedative. The scene increased the criticism of the handling of the tragedy as inept. Captain Vladimir Navrotsky, spokesman for the northern fleet, last night dismissed suggestions that the woman had been silenced for political reasons. \"I'd be surprised if there had been an injection purely to keep her from talking. Probably the woman was worked up because of the conditions in the crowded hall,\" he said. The incident occurred last Friday in the Kursk's home port, Vidyayevo, north of Murmansk, as Mr Klebanov was confronted by furious relatives voicing their anger at the loss of their loved-ones. Although the Kremlin has imposed an almost total media blackout, a cameraman filmed the woman telling navy officers to tear off their epaulettes. The footage appeared to expose a chilling act of arbitrary crowd control in the traditions of Soviet-era medical abuse. But while the film confirmed the views of those who see the Russian military authorities as carrying on many of the practices of the repressive Soviet authorities, others saw the furore as a yardstick of how far Russia has travelled beyond the habits of the Soviet era. Dozens of the relatives of the Kursk seamen have been on tranquillisers since the tragedy. That the film was shot at all and then shown extensively, illustrated how far Russia has advanced. If the incident reflected badly on Mr Klebanov, he endured worse on Tuesday when he was attacked by the wife of one of the dead, according to a Moscow journalist who clandestinely recorded the scene. Relatives asked Mr Klebanov when the bodies would be recovered. \"In a few months - maybe. a year. I don't know exactly,\" he replied. \"'The room erupted,\" reported Andrei Kolesnikov of the Kommersant newspaper. \"A woman shook him. 'You swine, get out there and save them.' Officers rushed to drag her away. It wasn't easy. She clung to Klebanov and shouted, 'You're nothing but scum'.\"",

      "body": "<p>It's been a tough old week for the residents, what with the exorcism of Resident Evil from their midst and everything, but that's nothing compared to the trauma that new housemate Claire's arrival has caused for the rest of us. </p> <p>It was a stroke of genius by Channel 4 not to opt for \"some mature lady\", as the housemates predicted, and plump instead for the honest-to-god tabloid charms of Busty Claire, 25. Five weeks in, the housemates have comprehensively run out of chat and have taken to reading books in the garden. </p> <p>Luckily, however, good old sexual frustration may yet save the day. Claire's been leapt on by Comedy Scouser Craig like fresh meat flung to a starving man; even Darren showed a momentary interest before retreating back into high-camp distraction and his increasingly unsettling preoccupation with Marjorie the chicken. (Tom, for whom it takes some time to broach with a lady the possibility of \"intimate moments\", has been rather eclipsed on this one). The women don't like her at all, of course - but that, as Mel pointed out, \"is what women do\". </p> <p>And viewers may yet come round to Claire and her giggling ways.

      "bodyText": "It's been a tough old week for the residents, what with the exorcism of Resident Evil from their midst and everything, but that's nothing compared to the trauma that new housemate Claire's arrival has caused for the rest of us. It was a stroke of genius by Channel 4 not to opt for \"some mature lady\", as the housemates predicted, and plump instead for the honest-to-god tabloid charms of Busty Claire, 25. Five weeks in, the housemates have comprehensively run out of chat and have taken to reading books in the garden. Luckily, however, good old sexual frustration may yet save the day. Claire's been leapt on by Comedy Scouser Craig like fresh meat flung to a starving man; even Darren showed a momentary interest before retreating back into high-camp distraction and his increasingly unsettling preoccupation with Marjorie the chicken. (Tom, for whom it takes some time to broach with a lady the possibility of \"intimate moments\", has been rather eclipsed on this one). The women don't like her at all, of course - but that, as Mel pointed out, \"is what women do\". And viewers may yet come round to Claire and her giggling ways. Because however successful the Big Brother format around the world, it does have one fundamental flaw that's only just beginning to dawn on us Brits. Namely, that as the series builds to its supposed climax, with fewer and fewer housemates remaining, it also becomes (whisper it) really quite dull to watch.

      "bodyText": "Greg Dyke will tonight stake his reputation as the BBC's director general on a seven-channel digital plan, in an important speech that will signal his intention to move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm and launch two new children's services. Warning that the BBC must transform if it is to survive the onset of mass-market digital broadcasting, he will provoke a political storm with his plans to revolutionise the corporation's television channels. In the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the start of the Guardian Edinburgh international television festival, Mr Dyke will outline a vision of the BBC in which its Reithian public service tradition is merged with the realities of the digital age. The corporation must continue to be available free to everyone, to avoid the emergence of a \"digital underclass\", he will argue. The plans will meet with strong opposition. Proposals to launch new services require the approval of the BBC's governors and the culture secretary, Chris Smith. At the moment, Mr Dyke has neither. Despite Mr Dyke conceding that the BBC \"cannot possibly afford to have a tank on every lawn\", the corporation's commercial rivals will be furious if it is allowed to expand its services in such a radical way.

      "body": "<p>How to go on holiday, in the days of wine and roses: put credit card and toothbrush in back pocket, passport down side of boot; get on motorbike; ride south.</p> <p>How to go on holiday in days of responsibility and parenthood: worry about pets.</p> <p>Recently I found myself not just hearing, not just agreeing with, but actually uttering the phrase: \"You need a holiday to get over it, don't you?\"</p> <p>We have four pets. Pet one is a dead (empty, even) tortoise that we found in a field in Italy - about as low-maintenance as you can get, and suitable for asthmatics. Perfect. Pets two, three and four are goldfish. Hardly demanding. I enter into negotiations with various neighbours, friends and the man undergoing a domestic crisis who is currently kipping under my desk, to see who will look after them.</p> <p>I have just had a cousin's rabbit for a week. It gave my daughter asthma, even though it was in the garden, and me ridiculous agricultural fantasies. But then one dawn the domestic-crisis man, coming back from an evening out, found it having a Mexican stand-off with a giant bandit cat, which would definitely have had him if we hadn't scared him off. A Zen bunny-catching scenario developed, with the man smoking, me lounging nonchalantly on the garden furniture pretending to the rabbit that I wasn't there at all and the rabbit hippitty-hopping all over the place.</p> <p>It was a fine old romantic-comedy interlude: Cary 'n' Katharine; Meg 'n' Tom - the pyjamas, you know, the tousle-headed thing. For an hour. Five till 6am. Then one successful lunge and the creature was back in the hutch. When the cousin came to fetch it she said, \"I wasn't really worried,\" in a voice that told me she had been, a bit, in a quiet, low-level way.</p> <p>Pet-care credentials established, the man living under my desk accepted care of the fish while child and I absconded to the Med. In a quiet, low-level way I was a little worried about them, but when we returned the house was pristine, the fish frilly and the man absent. How delightful!</p> <p>He reappeared on the telephone. \"There's been a domestic crisis,\" he said. (What, another one? How many wives do you have to throw you out?) \"I don't know if you've noticed.\"</p> <p>The only thing I'd noticed, I told him, was that he seemed to have cleaned out the fish, and how touched I was, and that this was really beyond the call of duty... the beeps went and the phone cut off.</p> <p>Half-an-hour later he turns up. \"How could you tell? How?\"</p> <p>Tell what? Oh the fish - well, the stones were in different places.

      "bodyText": "How to go on holiday, in the days of wine and roses: put credit card and toothbrush in back pocket, passport down side of boot; get on motorbike; ride south. How to go on holiday in days of responsibility and parenthood: worry about pets. Recently I found myself not just hearing, not just agreeing with, but actually uttering the phrase: \"You need a holiday to get over it, don't you?\" We have four pets. Pet one is a dead (empty, even) tortoise that we found in a field in Italy - about as low-maintenance as you can get, and suitable for asthmatics. Perfect. Pets two, three and four are goldfish. Hardly demanding. I enter into negotiations with various neighbours, friends and the man undergoing a domestic crisis who is currently kipping under my desk, to see who will look after them. I have just had a cousin's rabbit for a week. It gave my daughter asthma, even though it was in the garden, and me ridiculous agricultural fantasies. But then one dawn the domestic-crisis man, coming back from an evening out, found it having a Mexican stand-off with a giant bandit cat, which would definitely have had him if we hadn't scared him off. A Zen bunny-catching scenario developed, with the man smoking, me lounging nonchalantly on the garden furniture pretending to the rabbit that I wasn't there at all and the rabbit hippitty-hopping all over the place. It was a fine old romantic-comedy interlude: Cary 'n' Katharine; Meg 'n' Tom - the pyjamas, you know, the tousle-headed thing. For an hour. Five till 6am. Then one successful lunge and the creature was back in the hutch. When the cousin came to fetch it she said, \"I wasn't really worried,\" in a voice that told me she had been, a bit, in a quiet, low-level way. Pet-care credentials established, the man living under my desk accepted care of the fish while child and I absconded to the Med. In a quiet, low-level way I was a little worried about them, but when we returned the house was pristine, the fish frilly and the man absent. How delightful! He reappeared on the telephone. \"There's been a domestic crisis,\" he said. (What, another one? How many wives do you have to throw you out?) \"I don't know if you've noticed.\" The only thing I'd noticed, I told him, was that he seemed to have cleaned out the fish, and how touched I was, and that this was really beyond the call of duty... the beeps went and the phone cut off. Half-an-hour later he turns up. \"How could you tell? How?\" Tell what? Oh the fish - well, the stones were in different places. They were shovelled in a pile in the middle, whereas I arrange them in a classical landscape, falling away from the horizon (the kitchen wall) like some photogravure of a Byronic gorge, laws of proportion and perspective applied, and pond weed placed just so. Like Alan Bennett cleaning the gunk off the tip of the handcream tube, I have curious little ways of avoiding work. \"And?\" he said. And what? Later it comes out. He had indeed cleaned them out - in the gangster sense. He'd killed them. They died all three, floating one morning in fishy eternity, sleeping, as it were, with the fishes. Holding his nose, he'd garnered their smelly little bodies and taken them down to the pet shop in the market. There they were laid out and their identifying marks noted.

      "bodyText": "The former MI5 officer David Shayler appeared in court for the first time yesterday, three years to the day after making the disclosures which are the subject of the charges against him. Carmen Dowd, for the crown prosecution service, said Mr Shayler was charged under the Official Secrets Act with disclosing information in the Mail on Sunday on August 24, 1997, which was damaging to national security and to MI5's capability to carry out its work. She also said Mr Shayler had passed 62 \"sensitive\" documents to the newspaper relating to the activities of the security services. The subjects of the disclosures in the newspaper ranged from MI5's practice of keeping files on prominent Labour politicians, including Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw, as well as pop musicians - including John Lennon - to MI5's alleged incompetence in tracking Khalifa Ahmed Bazelya, a suspected Libyan intelligence officer then based in London. It is understood that as recently as last month, the prosecution was actively considering further charges including Mr Shayler's more serious and embarrassing allegations, namely MI6 involvement in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy. It is not known whether these charges were abandoned after the intervention of Lord Williams, the attorney general. Charges under the Official Se crets Act require the attorney's consent. The two offences with which Mr Shayler is charged were agreed by John Morris, Lord Williams's predecessor, at the time of the failed attempt to extradite the renegade MI5 officer from Paris in August 1998. A CPS spokeswoman said yesterday that the case papers had been reviewed and it was decided to choose two charges on the basis of the evidence. It is clear, however, that MI5 and MI6 would not welcome argument about the Gadafy plot and other sensitive allegations in open court. Much of the brief hearing at Bow Street magistrates' court in central London yesterday was taken up with discussion about Mr Shayler's bail conditions, notably whether he must stay with his brother in south London. \"He is a supporter of Middlesbrough football team, and the season has started, and he wishes to go to see Middlesbrough play this Saturday,\" said John Wadham, his lawyer, who is the director of Liberty, the civil rights group. \"Just imagine the publicity if the chief magistrate stopped him,\" replied London's chief stipendiary magistrate, Graham Parkinson. Mr Parkinson agreed to lifting of reporting restrictions. Mr Wadham told Mr Parkinson that Mr Shayler had returned voluntarily to Britain. Mr Shayler said after the hearing: \"I am glad the magistrate was sympathetic enough to let me go and see Middlesbrough play.\" He added: \"It is good to have the opportunity to appear in open court. I am glad that the legal process has begun. \"It gives us all the chance to examine the Official Secrets Act in the light of the human rights legislation.\" Useful Links MI5 Freedom of information bill",

      "body": "<p>Trends come and go in the City, almost as quickly as they do on the catwalks of Paris and Milan. Yesterday the fashionable thing to do was to rotate: sell the outperformers to buy the underperformers. So telecom shares were de rigueur and oil and banking stocks were old hat. </p> <p>The net result of the rotation was that the FTSE 100 index ended almost unchanged, down 9.2 points at 6,557, as the gains in one sector were cancelled about by losses in another. Market turnover, however, was heavy at 1.8b. </p> <p>US investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was said to have started the rotation, after it encouraged clients to pile into telecoms group <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless </strong> . </p> <p>Citing the strength of the company's balance sheet and rather cryptically \"further corporate activity\", MSDW lifted its investment recommendation on the stock to \"strong buy\" and set a \u00a314.50 price target. C&amp;W shares ended 60p higher at \u00a311.86 - the best performer in the FTSE 100. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Investec Henderson Crosthwaite was said to be out banging the drum for embattled <strong> BT </strong> . Analysts at the brokerage believe the stock is worth around \u00a314 on a sum-of-the-parts basis. At the close BT shares, which have fallen sharply this week on fears about debt levels, were 23p better 819p. </p> <p>Market heavyweight <strong> Vodafone</strong> also joined in the fun. It was lifted by news that Verizon Wireless, in which it has a 45% stake, has filed with US regulators to raise $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) in an initial public offering and that Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa has no plans to sell its 3.4% holding in the company. </p> <p>With investors looking at these factors and not the cost of third-generation mobile phone licenses, Vodafone shares rose 7.5p to 262p - equivalent to 22.5 points on the FTSE 100. </p> <p> <strong> Energis </strong> , the long-distance telecoms group, added 9p to 500p. According to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, if Richard Branson's People's Lottery takes over the running of the National Lottery, Energis, which will provide the data networking services, could see its revenues rise 3%-5%. </p> <p>And the feel-good factor even extended to the FTSE 250 index. <strong> Atlantic Telecom</strong> shares put on 32p to close at 282p helped by an ABN Amro \"buy\" note and <strong> Thus </strong> ended 2p higher at 122p. </p> <p>The flip side of the telecoms surge was of course weakness in the oil and banking sectors. </p> <p>JP Morgan spoke for many when it lowered its ratings on <strong> BP</strong> (down 10.5p to 636p) and <strong> Shell </strong> (off 19p at 591p). \"We believe the sector strength, which has taken several shares to new highs, is being driven by peak commodity pricing which is likely to prove unsustainable, rather than by fundamental valuation,\" the brokerage said in a research note. </p> <p>A touch of reality also returned to the banking sector as analysts at UBS Warburg and Deutsche Bank warned investors not to get carried away be recent gains. </p> <p>Although the sector has rallied strongly in the past month, helped by a supportive bond market and <strong> Barclays </strong> (off 41p to \u00a317.59) bid for <strong> Woolwich </strong> (6p lower at 362p), things remain tough. Analysts believe the impact of increased competition has yet to feed through to the bottom line. </p> <p> <strong> Lloyds TSB </strong> , which has risen 15% in the past week, fell 20p to 640p, while <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong> lost 4p to 596p and <strong> Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> eased 30p to \u00a313.16. </p> <p>Aero-engineer <strong> Rolls-Royce</strong> fell 49p to 169.5p after issuing a surprise profit warning, while <strong> Hilton</strong> eased 9.5p to 235.5p after disappointing interim figures. </p> <p>But <strong> ARM Holdings</strong> advanced 30p to 759p following news that industry leader Intel will be using one ARM's designs in its new XScale processor. Merrill Lynch has a \u00a310.80 price objective for the shares. </p> <p> <strong> Logica</strong> rose 45p to \u00a317.71, <strong> Sema</strong> added 21.5p to \u00a311.10 and <strong> Bookham Technology</strong> gained 89p to \u00a338.14.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trends come and go in the City, almost as quickly as they do on the catwalks of Paris and Milan. Yesterday the fashionable thing to do was to rotate: sell the outperformers to buy the underperformers. So telecom shares were de rigueur and oil and banking stocks were old hat. The net result of the rotation was that the FTSE 100 index ended almost unchanged, down 9.2 points at 6,557, as the gains in one sector were cancelled about by losses in another. Market turnover, however, was heavy at 1.8b. US investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was said to have started the rotation, after it encouraged clients to pile into telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless . Citing the strength of the company's balance sheet and rather cryptically \"further corporate activity\", MSDW lifted its investment recommendation on the stock to \"strong buy\" and set a \u00a314.50 price target. C&amp;W shares ended 60p higher at \u00a311.86 - the best performer in the FTSE 100. Meanwhile, Investec Henderson Crosthwaite was said to be out banging the drum for embattled BT . Analysts at the brokerage believe the stock is worth around \u00a314 on a sum-of-the-parts basis. At the close BT shares, which have fallen sharply this week on fears about debt levels, were 23p better 819p. Market heavyweight Vodafone also joined in the fun. It was lifted by news that Verizon Wireless, in which it has a 45% stake, has filed with US regulators to raise $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) in an initial public offering and that Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa has no plans to sell its 3.4% holding in the company. With investors looking at these factors and not the cost of third-generation mobile phone licenses, Vodafone shares rose 7.5p to 262p - equivalent to 22.5 points on the FTSE 100. Energis , the long-distance telecoms group, added 9p to 500p. According to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, if Richard Branson's People's Lottery takes over the running of the National Lottery, Energis, which will provide the data networking services, could see its revenues rise 3%-5%. And the feel-good factor even extended to the FTSE 250 index. Atlantic Telecom shares put on 32p to close at 282p helped by an ABN Amro \"buy\" note and Thus ended 2p higher at 122p. The flip side of the telecoms surge was of course weakness in the oil and banking sectors. JP Morgan spoke for many when it lowered its ratings on BP (down 10.5p to 636p) and Shell (off 19p at 591p). \"We believe the sector strength, which has taken several shares to new highs, is being driven by peak commodity pricing which is likely to prove unsustainable, rather than by fundamental valuation,\" the brokerage said in a research note. A touch of reality also returned to the banking sector as analysts at UBS Warburg and Deutsche Bank warned investors not to get carried away be recent gains. Although the sector has rallied strongly in the past month, helped by a supportive bond market and Barclays (off 41p to \u00a317.59) bid for Woolwich (6p lower at 362p), things remain tough. Analysts believe the impact of increased competition has yet to feed through to the bottom line. Lloyds TSB , which has risen 15% in the past week, fell 20p to 640p, while Bank of Scotland lost 4p to 596p and Royal Bank of Scotland eased 30p to \u00a313.16. Aero-engineer Rolls-Royce fell 49p to 169.5p after issuing a surprise profit warning, while Hilton eased 9.5p to 235.5p after disappointing interim figures. But ARM Holdings advanced 30p to 759p following news that industry leader Intel will be using one ARM's designs in its new XScale processor. Merrill Lynch has a \u00a310.80 price objective for the shares. Logica rose 45p to \u00a317.71, Sema added 21.5p to \u00a311.10 and Bookham Technology gained 89p to \u00a338.14.",

Comparisons had proved difficult in a government study into nutritional composition of organic and conventionally-grown fruit and vegetables 10 years ago. Research from Copenhagen University this year suggesting higher levels of nutrients in organic foods had only looked at one small component - polyphenols - in a few foods. There was also insufficient evidence that organic produce was likely to cause more food poisoning.

      "bodyText": "Anglian Water yesterday surprised the City by announcing plans to diversify into construction, through a \u00a3262m takeover of the Scottish family-run building firm Morrison. The move, which means a \u00a3115m fortune for the two brothers who manage the Edinburgh-based company, will allow Anglian to compete for large infrastructure projects - such as building sewage works, gas pipelines and hospitals. Anglian's managing director Chris Mellor described the deal as a \"quantum leap forward\" for the group. \"What we're up to is creating a new sort of company which really doesn't exist at the moment,\" he said. The takeover is part of Anglian's strategy of reducing its reliance on the more tightly regulated water supply business. The company wants to provide an all-round service of designing, constructing and managing facilities, both inside and outside the water industry.

Chairman Sir Fraser Morrison admitted he had held \"a number of discussion\" with other companies. Sir Fraser and his brother Gordon Morrison each have a 22% stake. The company was established by their father, a Highland joiner, in 1948. It was bought by an international mining group in 1974 but the family bought it back in 1980. Morrison was floated on the stock market five years ago, valued at \u00a375m.

A French consortium has made a 650p a share offer valuing the company - which was at the centre of the Paddington rail disaster through its Thames Trains subsidiary - at \u00a3326m. Last year Mr Ballinger was paid a salary of \u00a3175,000, and he is on a two-year contract which would have to be bought out if the French succeed in their bid. Last night City analysts said an increased offer might be needed to win control of the company, which operates some London buses as well as rail services to the capital. Go-Ahead management said it was unanimous in rejecting the offer, which \"fails to recognise the strategic value of Go-Ahead, its performance to date and future prospects.\" The Newcastle-based company is chasing the South Central rail franchise as well as the two it controls through its holdings in the Thames Trains and Thameslink operations. Go-Ahead chairman Sir Frederick Holliday said the bid by Caisse des Depots-Developpement, or C3D, and Rhone Capital was purposely timed to precede the Strategic Rail Authority's decision on South Central. The French have turned aggressive after informal appoaches were made but rebuffed last month. C3D chairman Patrice Garnier accepted the bid was politically sensitive but said: \"We remain keen to reach agreement with the Go-Ahead board.\" The French company wants to combine Go-Ahead with its Transdev subsidiary and use it as a platform to expand in Europe. Shares in Go-Ahead soared 20% after the initial approach from C3D but yesterday they dropped a 1p at 675p. The 650p a share offer represents a 50p premium over its 433.5p price on July 6, when the predators first made their approach. Go-Ahead shares had reached 920p last year before they were hit by the negative publicity surrounding the crash of a Thames train near London's Paddington station. If Go-Ahead does fall it would give French companies a tighter grip on London transport because Connex holds the franchise for South Central and South Eastern trains. The French presence is not the only other controversial aspect of the deal. Sir Patrick Brown, a civil service bureaucrat with a hand in the rail privatisation process, is on the board of Go-Ahead.",

Several of the company's biggest tenants, which manage its nursing homes, have gone out of business, leaving the group significantly short of rental income.</p> <p>Since going public five years ago, NHP has spent close to \u00a3700m on nursing homes.

      "bodyText": "Britain's largest owner of nursing homes, NHP, is to part company with its chief executive, Richard Ellert, after a tough year for the industry in which the group's market value has collapsed by 75%. NHP announced it had reached an \"amicable agreement\" under which Mr Ellert was resigning with effect from the end of the month. It is understood that Mr Ellert will receive a substantial pay-off - he is on a one-year rolling contract with a salary of close to \u00a3300,000. Insiders said Mr Ellert's departure was partly due to a proposed tie-up with Southern Cross Healthcare, which for the first time would take NHP into operating, rather than leasing out, care homes. However, he has come under growing pressure from institutional investors about NHP's difficulties in recent months. Several of the company's biggest tenants, which manage its nursing homes, have gone out of business, leaving the group significantly short of rental income. Since going public five years ago, NHP has spent close to \u00a3700m on nursing homes. Three securitisations have raised more than \u00a3550m and the company has an estate of more than 300 properties. These debts have caused concern as nursing homes have become less profitable due to a shortage of trained staff and complicated health and safety regulations. NHP made a first-half loss of \u00a37m. The collapse in NHP's shares has been accelerated by several high-profile disagreements. NHP's property consultant, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, criticised the way its valuation of the company's estate had been presented in a \u00a3194m fundraising last year. Executives from the company met the serious fraud office in March to look into allegations that a \"dirty tricks\" conspiracy by outsiders had worsened the decline in its share price. NHP yesterday denied reports that its bankers and institutional shareholders had asked for Mr Ellert's departure. The company's finance director, Bill Colvin, will run the company until the end of the year, when he is due to leave for a position at the construction firm Jarvis. It was unclear last night whether Mr Ellert's Spanish girlfriend, Marisa Hontoria, was still employed by NHP as a consultant. The company's shares were unchanged at 37.5p, against 200p a year ago.",

Others may not. \"We don't want to be heroes, but we have a responsibility to do our jobs,\" he said.</p> <p>Eta called a ceasefire after the moderate Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which governs the region, moved closer to self-determination. The return to murder has strained that alliance, but Madrid wants it completely ruptured to isolate the militants.</p> <p>Critics accuse the mainstream media of slavishly backing Madrid's wishes, rather than encouraging the PNV to repair the alliance in the hope of wooing Eta back from the gun.</p> <p>\"This is a crucial phase. The PNV is coming under massive pressure to renounce the militants. If it does, it's a disaster, we're back to square one,\" said Gorka Espiau, of Elkarri, a non-partisan peace group.</p> <p>This morning, hundreds of youths in balaclavas will assemble at the town hall to cheer the raising of the Basque flag as part of the city's annual festival.</p> <p>When the Spanish flag is also raised stones and petrol bombs will fly through the air and a riot will ensue. While Efren and Garikoitz have outgrown such frivolity, they thought they might go along to watch their successors warming up.</p>",

Banks and mansions wear the scars of past firebombs, hurled to fulfil the group's anti-capitalist ideology. \"Kids here are well educated and well off but they join for emotional reasons, to be anti-establishment, to belong,\" said a pensioner, Juan Albeniz. While few in this region are willing to openly side with Madrid, Eta has its enemies. \"They are spoilt, murderous fascists,\" said Consuela Ordonez, 40, whose brother Gregorio, a councillor in San Sebastian, was shot dead. She said Madrid's refusal to negotiate had not sunk the ceasefire. \"The sole responsibility for the violence resuming is Eta's. They're a gang of fanatics. They hate society, they don't listen to people.\" Pessimistic about a resolution, she condemned the ambivalence of moderate Basque nationalists. \"Why don't they do more to stop the attacks? I don't understand.\" In addition to soldiers, police officers, businessmen and politicians, Eta's renewed campaign has been aimed at artists, intellectuals and journalists, including the columnist Jose Luis de la Calle, shot dead in May. Some writers may be intimidated into censoring their criticism, said Jose Manuel Alonso, a director of the newspaper El Mundo. Others may not. \"We don't want to be heroes, but we have a responsibility to do our jobs,\" he said. Eta called a ceasefire after the moderate Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which governs the region, moved closer to self-determination. The return to murder has strained that alliance, but Madrid wants it completely ruptured to isolate the militants. Critics accuse the mainstream media of slavishly backing Madrid's wishes, rather than encouraging the PNV to repair the alliance in the hope of wooing Eta back from the gun. \"This is a crucial phase. The PNV is coming under massive pressure to renounce the militants. If it does, it's a disaster, we're back to square one,\" said Gorka Espiau, of Elkarri, a non-partisan peace group. This morning, hundreds of youths in balaclavas will assemble at the town hall to cheer the raising of the Basque flag as part of the city's annual festival. When the Spanish flag is also raised stones and petrol bombs will fly through the air and a riot will ensue. While Efren and Garikoitz have outgrown such frivolity, they thought they might go along to watch their successors warming up.",

Speaking to the Scottish engineering senior executive dinner in Glasgow, Ms Julius said \"we think that private spending growth may be slowing from high levels\", partly thanks to the Bank's tighter policy and sterling strength.",

Under unprecedented criticism from the Russian press for his perceived failure of leadership at a time of national tragedy, Mr Putin lashed out, threatening to punish the proprietors and fight their influence through alternative \"honest and objective\" media. His outburst came late on Tuesday at a closed and tightly controlled meeting in the northern navy port of Vidyayevo, where he spent almost three hours with the families of the 118 dead seamen of the Kursk. No outsiders are allowed near Vidyayevo and security in the two weeks since the disaster has been especially tight. Posing as relatives of the dead, two Moscow journalists from leading national newspapers, Grigori Nekhoroshev of Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Andrei Kolesnikov of Kommersant, spent several days in Vidyayevo and saw the emotional encounter between Mr Putin and 500 Kursk relatives. Howling at Mr Putin, widows and mothers who, along with the rest of Russia, had been glued to their television screens throughout the Kursk drama, demanded to know why they had received so much contradictory information. Mr Putin blamed television reporting, the journalists said, and then launched the strongest attack on the Russian media he has made since becoming president. \"They are liars. The television has people who have been destroying the state for 10 years. They have been thieving money and buying up absolutely everything,\" he said, according to Mr Nekhoroshev, a former BBC employee. \"Now they're trying to discredit the country so that the army gets even worse.\" Mr Kolesnikov believes that the Kremlin was sending a strong political signal of further pressure to come. In an interview on state television on Wednesday evening, Mr Putin made barely veiled threats against the two top television moguls, Boris Berezovsky, who controls the main state channel, ORT, and Vladimir Gusinsky, who owns the biggest private channel, NTV. Blaming the messengers while provisionally exonerating the military and political leaders for their botched handling of the Kursk disaster, Mr Putin said the media were \"unscrupulously trying to exploit this misfortune...to gain political capital\". In a clear reference to Mr Berezovsky and Mr Gusinsky, he said: \"They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then they might have to explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money.\" The Russian media have been energetically exploring the Kursk tragedy, exposing navy humbug and Kremlin cover-ups, providing the names of the dead when the authorities refused to do so, and frustrating Kremlin attempts to control the coverage. The second state channel, RTR, has been favoured with exclusive access to a navy cruiser at the site of the sinking. It was also given the interview with the president, and it provided the only sanctioned, and extremely restricted, pictures of Mr Putin's meeting in Vidyayevo. The head of RTR is Oleg Dobrodeyev, a founder of NTV in the early 90s, who broke with Mr Gusinsky earlier this year over the channel's critical coverage of the Chechen war and last year's pro-western coverage of the conflict in Kosovo.",

In a statement issued today, certain to be agreed by the full congress, the TUC General Council says it believes the legal minimum of \u00a33.70 an hour has had less impact than had been expected, and should be uprated by October next year to reflect increasing earnings and to help \"close the gap between the rich and poor\". Although the TUC has encouraged use of the \u00a35 figure as a wage bargaining target with employers, the demand to make this figure into a legally enforceable minimum is a significant advance on its previous call for \"somewhat more than \u00a34\", and was immediately criticised as \"potentially very damaging\" by the CBI, the main employers' organisation. Susan Anderson, CBI human resources director, said now was \"not the time to throw caution to the wind\", following a successful introduction in April last year. A \u00a35 statutory minimum would increase the pay of at least 2.5m part or full time workers, she said, compared to the 1.7m covered by the existing rate. Other proposals by the TUC, to get rid of the lower rate for workers under 21 and to introduce a minimum for 16 and 17-year-olds, were, she said, \"own goals\" that would result in there being fewer jobs for young people. The TUC general secretary, John Monks, described the minimum wage as being one of the government's greatest achievements, but qualified this praise by saying that the 10p per hour increase to \u00a33.70 from this October was \"welcome, but not enough\". \"Now it is clear, despite employer warnings, that the minimum wage's impact on jobs is negligible, it should be uprated to a more realistic level,\" said Mr Monks. \"Discredited employer scaremongering should not be permanently built into its level.\" The government's advisory body, the low pay commission, is due to make a recommendation next summer on whether and by how much to increase the minimum. The chancellor is blamed by union leaders for insisting on the creation of the lower youth minimum wage and for the delay in bringing in the \u00a33.70 adult rate, and also for setting this year's increase in the state pension at 75p a week. He is consequenetly expected to try to use his speech to highlight his credentials as being in reality a friend of the labour movement. The final agenda for the Glasgow congress shows the government will face pressure over its part-privatisation plans for air traffic control and the London Underground, as well as its enthusiasm for using the private finance initiative in public services. And it will come under attack over its policies towards asylum seekers, described in a Transport and General Workers' Union motion as serving to \"further alienate, stigmatise and segregate refugees\". \u0095 The Ford car company has been warned by the commission for racial equality to act on pledges it gave last year regarding treatment of its black and Asian workers, following years of allegations of racism at its Dagenham plant in Essex and a employment tribunal finding of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.

      "bodyText": "Norwegians and a Briton involved in the attempt to save the crew of the submarine Kursk went public for the first time yesterday in criticising senior Russian navy officials for hampering the rescue operation. Norwegian military commanders lined up to complain about the lack of cooperation, while the head of the country's rescue team revealed that he had threatened to pull out because of frustration. A British crew member of the rescue team also expressed bitter disappointment. But the Royal Navy, more coy than the Norwegians, distanced itself from his comments, saying he was not a member of the Royal Navy but just part of the support ship. The Norwegians and British had hinted in private at their frustration with Russia's lack of urgency in allowing them to use their sophisticated submersible technology, but until now have avoided going public. The criticism will add to the pressure from the Russian public on President Vladimir Putin, whose image was dented by his delay in seeking international help. Paddy Heron, a British member of the crew of the Norman Pioneer, told BBC Scotland that the Russians had frustrated their efforts. \"Any arrangement or proposed operation that they spoke about was rescinded, gone back on, altered or countermanded.\" He said the British team had been \"revolted\" to hear the Russians say they had done everything they could. \"We had one of the most sophisticated vessels available in Europe sitting at the wreck site with a submersible specifically designed to rescue men from submarines,\" he said. \"The Russians would not let us use that.\" The Ministry of Defence said that Mr Heron was neither in the Royal Navy nor part of the submersible team, but a junior member of the crew of the Norman Pioneer, which was chartered by the Royal Navy from a private company. Lieutenant Colonel John Espen Lien, spokesman for the Norwegian supreme defence command, said the early information from the Russians was so bad that the Norwegians were not sure that the conditions were safe for the diving team to continue. \"It would have been very difficult for us to continue if the information had not improved,\" he said. \"It took unnecessary time, to the point that we had to take it up at top levels.\" The Russians said that an escape hatch on the Kursk was badly damaged. Norwegian officials and divers said it was not. \"That was one of the areas in which there was incorrect information,\" Col Lien said. \"The Russians never explained what happened...I don't know where in the system that misinformation arose.\" He said the problems lay not with the commanders of Russia's northern fleet, but with lower ranking officers unsure how much information they could give to Britain and Norway, both members of Nato. The leader of Norway's rescue effort, Rear Admiral Einar Skorgen, said in comments to the Norwegian daily Nordlandsposten that he had threatened to call off the rescue effort out of frustration with the Russians. \"I was really angry,\" he said. Admiral Skorgen, head of the armed forces in northern Norway, said he telephoned the Russian northern fleet to say that the mission would be in jeopardy unless Russia provided correct data. \"I think this was understood as a threat from my side, yes,\" he said. \"At times there were so many wrong details and disinformation from Russia that it was close to endangering the divers,\" he said. \"We couldn't rely on the information we were getting.\"",

Despite an almost total ban on the media in Vidyayevo and at the relatives' meetings with navy and government officials, a cameraman for a local television station in the nearby port of Murmansk filmed the woman telling Mr Klebanov what she thought of him, and ordering naval officers to tear off their epaulettes.

Police divers recovered the bodies of Louise Wood, 12, and Hayleigh Hinton, eight, from Ashbyville pond, Scunthorpe, at around 1am yesterday after a four hour search. The girls, who had gone to the pond on their bikes on Wednesday evening, got into difficulties along with Louise's brother, Josh, seven, as they played on a rope swing over the water. Hayleigh's brother, Colin Laister, 12, managed to rescue Josh but lost sight of the girls and ran to a hotel to raise the alarm. Police, fire crews and a helicopter with thermal imaging equipment scanned the pond, which has dense weed below the surface, but found no sign of the girls. A Humberside police spokesman said the children's relatives were at the scene throughout the search. A witness said the parents could be heard sobbing as the bodies were eventually recovered by police divers. Flowers were left at the scene yesterday afternoon in memory of the two girls.

They lost relatives in last year's bloodletting, they saw loved ones executed before their eyes, and they were driven from their homes. Now - just as they are struggling to rebuild their lives - they are being called liars and accused of faking their grief for political gain.</p> <p>The Kosovo backlash is in full swing. The criticism of last year's Nato campaign against the Serbs - quite properly - opened a debate over \"humanitarian intervention\" and whether such intervention should involve dropping cluster bombs from high altitude.</p> <p>But the backlash has gone further, casting doubt on the scale and nature of Serb atrocities and calling into question eyewitness accounts of the killing. The allegations are serious - hinting at a conspiracy between Nato, the press, the humanitarian agencies and the refugees themselves - yet they are based on no more than partial and misconstrued evidence.</p> <p>The starting point for the wave of revisionism has been the exhumations carried out by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. As of mid-July, tribunal investigators confirmed they had recovered the remains of 2,808 bodies, believed to be victims of the Serb ethnic cleansing campaign. That routine announcement triggered reports that the total death toll had been less than 3,000 and that Nato (with the aid of its co-conspirators) had deliberately inflated the casualty figures, with estimates of 10,000 dead and more, to justify its intervention.</p> <p>No one is more bemused by these claims than their supposed source - the Hague tribunal itself. Paul Risley, the chief prosecutor's spokesman, says he is unsure how his tally of exhumations to date came to be portrayed as a final toll.</p> <p>The search for bodies is continuing. Seven forensic teams are currently probing Kosovo's tortured earth, and aim to investigate another 150 reported grave sites before winter sets in. That will leave 200 sites to go. And more are being reported all the time.</p> <p>In October, the tribunal will make a decision as to whether to continue its forensic work. If the digging is called off, it will be because the prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to mount a war crimes case against the Serb leadership in Belgrade. It will not be because there are no more bodies to find.</p> <p>According to Risley, there is a rule of thumb among those whose job it is to literally pick up the pieces after such bloody conflicts. You seldom find more than half the bodies. Kosovo is unlikely to be an exception. Returning refugees found the bodies of their friends and relatives lying in their houses or gardens, in roadside ditches, or scattered through the forests and mountains. The remains were quickly buried in individual graves, prayers spoken and word was passed about who had been found. There was no reason to seek out the Red Cross to add their names to the list of the missing. Their fate was known.</p> <p>In nearby Bosnia, five years after the war, war crimes investigators are still stumbling across more graves, still finding bones on hillsides. The search will take years in Kosovo as well, and there is reason to believe that even fewer of the bodies will be found. If there was one lesson President Milosevic took from Bosnia, it was to make more of an effort to hide the evidence.</p> <p>Several mass graves in Kosovo were systematically emptied last summer by the retreating Serb troops. In the village of Izbica, there was well-documented evidence, including videotape and satellite photographs, of the killing and burial of nearly 150 Kosovans in an open pasture. By the time Nato arrived, the field was a mass of churned earth scarred by the caterpillar tracks of heavy diggers. The same happened in Pusto Selo, near Orahovac, and the hamlet of Rezalla, north of Pristina. There is strong evidence that some of the bodies were incinerated in factories, or in some cases burnt on bonfires at the murder scene.</p> <p>Sure enough, some wild figures did fly about for a few days. The US defence secretary, William Cohen, said in May that 100,000 military-aged men were missing and \"may have been murdered\". That was clearly an exaggeration, but not much of a conspiracy. The 100,000 figure never gained wide circulation and the estimate most often quoted by Nato officials was 10,000 dead, a guess shared by many humanitarian workers on the borders at the time. Today, it still looks like a reasonable assessment.</p> <p>In the absence of complete forensic evidence, the only feasible scientific way of gauging the extent of the bloodshed is to take sample surveys of the population and extrapolate. One such epidemiological survey was published in the Lancet in July, estimating that 12,000 people had been killed by \"war-related trauma\" in Kosovo from February 1998 to June 1999.</p> <p>On one issue, human rights organisations are agreed. The testimony provided by the traumatised refugees as they arrived at the Macedonian, Albanian and Montenegrin borders last year was eventually borne out by the facts. There is no evidence of any concerted effort to deceive or exaggerate. The idea that these exhausted terrified people had time to concoct coherent, corroborated testimony is as absurd as it is offensive.</p> <p>Joanne Mariner, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who trudged across Kosovo for months checking and rechecking reports of atrocities, said: \"The refugees never cited numbers. They talked about who they had seen killed. All the reports I investigated based on what I was told - they all turned out to be true. I went to the villages and checked them out.\"</p> <p>We have been here before. There has been a campaign to deny the existence of death camps in Bosnia. There was talk that the death toll from the Srebrenica massacre had been inflated. Rumours were spread that the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo were shelling themselves. None of these claims, of course, turned out to be true.</p> <p>The west stopped the killing in Bosnia three years too late, after 100,000 or more victims were already dead. In Kosovo, an attempt was made to learn from the past, and to act sooner rather than later. It is a tough decision to take, but one that could not and should not be dodged. Or should we watch from afar as the victims wail with grief on our television screens, and then a year or so later - when the dead have long been buried and memories have blurred - decide that maybe all those screaming foreigners were just trying to fool us after all?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The allegations are serious - hinting at a conspiracy between Nato, the press, the humanitarian agencies and the refugees themselves - yet they are based on no more than partial and misconstrued evidence. The starting point for the wave of revisionism has been the exhumations carried out by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. As of mid-July, tribunal investigators confirmed they had recovered the remains of 2,808 bodies, believed to be victims of the Serb ethnic cleansing campaign. That routine announcement triggered reports that the total death toll had been less than 3,000 and that Nato (with the aid of its co-conspirators) had deliberately inflated the casualty figures, with estimates of 10,000 dead and more, to justify its intervention. No one is more bemused by these claims than their supposed source - the Hague tribunal itself. Paul Risley, the chief prosecutor's spokesman, says he is unsure how his tally of exhumations to date came to be portrayed as a final toll. The search for bodies is continuing. Seven forensic teams are currently probing Kosovo's tortured earth, and aim to investigate another 150 reported grave sites before winter sets in. That will leave 200 sites to go. And more are being reported all the time. In October, the tribunal will make a decision as to whether to continue its forensic work. If the digging is called off, it will be because the prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to mount a war crimes case against the Serb leadership in Belgrade. It will not be because there are no more bodies to find. According to Risley, there is a rule of thumb among those whose job it is to literally pick up the pieces after such bloody conflicts. You seldom find more than half the bodies. Kosovo is unlikely to be an exception. Returning refugees found the bodies of their friends and relatives lying in their houses or gardens, in roadside ditches, or scattered through the forests and mountains. The remains were quickly buried in individual graves, prayers spoken and word was passed about who had been found. There was no reason to seek out the Red Cross to add their names to the list of the missing. Their fate was known. In nearby Bosnia, five years after the war, war crimes investigators are still stumbling across more graves, still finding bones on hillsides. The search will take years in Kosovo as well, and there is reason to believe that even fewer of the bodies will be found. If there was one lesson President Milosevic took from Bosnia, it was to make more of an effort to hide the evidence. Several mass graves in Kosovo were systematically emptied last summer by the retreating Serb troops. In the village of Izbica, there was well-documented evidence, including videotape and satellite photographs, of the killing and burial of nearly 150 Kosovans in an open pasture. By the time Nato arrived, the field was a mass of churned earth scarred by the caterpillar tracks of heavy diggers. The same happened in Pusto Selo, near Orahovac, and the hamlet of Rezalla, north of Pristina. There is strong evidence that some of the bodies were incinerated in factories, or in some cases burnt on bonfires at the murder scene. Sure enough, some wild figures did fly about for a few days. The US defence secretary, William Cohen, said in May that 100,000 military-aged men were missing and \"may have been murdered\". That was clearly an exaggeration, but not much of a conspiracy. The 100,000 figure never gained wide circulation and the estimate most often quoted by Nato officials was 10,000 dead, a guess shared by many humanitarian workers on the borders at the time. Today, it still looks like a reasonable assessment. In the absence of complete forensic evidence, the only feasible scientific way of gauging the extent of the bloodshed is to take sample surveys of the population and extrapolate. One such epidemiological survey was published in the Lancet in July, estimating that 12,000 people had been killed by \"war-related trauma\" in Kosovo from February 1998 to June 1999. On one issue, human rights organisations are agreed. The testimony provided by the traumatised refugees as they arrived at the Macedonian, Albanian and Montenegrin borders last year was eventually borne out by the facts. There is no evidence of any concerted effort to deceive or exaggerate. The idea that these exhausted terrified people had time to concoct coherent, corroborated testimony is as absurd as it is offensive. Joanne Mariner, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who trudged across Kosovo for months checking and rechecking reports of atrocities, said: \"The refugees never cited numbers. They talked about who they had seen killed. All the reports I investigated based on what I was told - they all turned out to be true. I went to the villages and checked them out.\" We have been here before. There has been a campaign to deny the existence of death camps in Bosnia. There was talk that the death toll from the Srebrenica massacre had been inflated. Rumours were spread that the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo were shelling themselves. None of these claims, of course, turned out to be true. The west stopped the killing in Bosnia three years too late, after 100,000 or more victims were already dead. In Kosovo, an attempt was made to learn from the past, and to act sooner rather than later. It is a tough decision to take, but one that could not and should not be dodged. Or should we watch from afar as the victims wail with grief on our television screens, and then a year or so later - when the dead have long been buried and memories have blurred - decide that maybe all those screaming foreigners were just trying to fool us after all? julian.borger@theguardian.com",

But two further attempts failed.</p> <p>Earlier, a statement by Gulf Air said: \"Approximately one nautical mile from touchdown and at about 600ft [185 metres] above sea level the aircraft commenced a go-around.\"</p> <p>It gave no reason for the decision to make a circuit.</p> <p>David Learmount, a safety expert at Flight International magazine, said the statement indicated that the plane was flying too high and probably too fast for a normal landing; one mile from touchdown it should have been at 300 feet.</p> <p>He said: \"If the pilot was flying on purpose at 600ft, a problem with the landing gear would fit the scenario.\"</p> <p>But he said this would not lead to an attempt to ditch the plane in the sea.</p> <p>\"They would lay a carpet of foam on the runway. Landing without wheels causes surprisingly little damage - planes very often fly again within six months.\"</p> <p>Another reason for making a circuit would be that the pilot had found himself too high by accident, possibly as a result of problems with air traffic control.</p> <p>A circuit involves a lot of work for the pilot, Mr Learmount said.</p> <p>\"You have to pull the nose up, put power on, bring the gear up and adjust the flaps. It shouldn't be a problem, but there have been quite a few examples in the last 10 years of pilots getting it wrong.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I have no reason to conclude this was pilot error from the information available.\"</p> <p>The names of people killed in accidents are not normally released until their families have been informed, but the Bahrain Tribune published a full list on its website yesterday while Foreign Office officials were still trying to contact relatives of one of the two Britons who died.</p> <p>The two were later named as Aileen Woods, 28, a resident of Bahrain, and Christopher Keenan, who lived in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Relatives of the 65 Egyptians killed in the crash left Cairo for Bahrain in a chartered plane yesterday to identify the bodies and bring them home for burial.

      "bodyText": "The Gulf Air plane which crashed off Bahrain on Wednesday was unable to lower its nose wheel for landing, sources quoted by a Bahraini newspaper claimed yesterday. All 143 people on board - including two Britons - died as the Airbus A320 plunged into the sea after two attempts to land. According to the sources, Captain Ihsan Shakeeb told the control tower that he could not release the front wheel, and was told to circle the airport and try again. But two further attempts failed. Earlier, a statement by Gulf Air said: \"Approximately one nautical mile from touchdown and at about 600ft [185 metres] above sea level the aircraft commenced a go-around.\" It gave no reason for the decision to make a circuit. David Learmount, a safety expert at Flight International magazine, said the statement indicated that the plane was flying too high and probably too fast for a normal landing; one mile from touchdown it should have been at 300 feet. He said: \"If the pilot was flying on purpose at 600ft, a problem with the landing gear would fit the scenario.\" But he said this would not lead to an attempt to ditch the plane in the sea. \"They would lay a carpet of foam on the runway. Landing without wheels causes surprisingly little damage - planes very often fly again within six months.\" Another reason for making a circuit would be that the pilot had found himself too high by accident, possibly as a result of problems with air traffic control. A circuit involves a lot of work for the pilot, Mr Learmount said. \"You have to pull the nose up, put power on, bring the gear up and adjust the flaps. It shouldn't be a problem, but there have been quite a few examples in the last 10 years of pilots getting it wrong.\" But he added: \"I have no reason to conclude this was pilot error from the information available.\" The names of people killed in accidents are not normally released until their families have been informed, but the Bahrain Tribune published a full list on its website yesterday while Foreign Office officials were still trying to contact relatives of one of the two Britons who died. The two were later named as Aileen Woods, 28, a resident of Bahrain, and Christopher Keenan, who lived in Abu Dhabi. Relatives of the 65 Egyptians killed in the crash left Cairo for Bahrain in a chartered plane yesterday to identify the bodies and bring them home for burial. Dozens of doctors and nurses and five ambulances were on hand to deal with grieving relatives, many of whom fainted or became hysterical The bereaved women among the 135 relatives were all dressed in black. A few who were unable to walk the short distance to the aircraft were pushed in a wheelchair. An official said there were 38 children under 12 on the ill-fated airliner.",

The meeting, in London, was the first for the coordinating group of the G77, which represents 80% of the world's population. The group is angry at the way the developing world has been excluded from decisions taken by such organisations as the Group of Seven, which represents the wealthiest countries. The two-day meeting was the most serious attempt by the developing world to acquire political muscle since the Non-Aligned Movement lost influence. The main people involve were the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo; the president of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad; the president of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika; the prime minister of Jamaica, James Patterson; and Cheryl Carolus, the South African high commissioner in London, representing President Thabo Mbeki. They issued a statement expressing concern about globalisation, trade barriers biased against developing countries, the environment, and debt. The statement reinforced the necessity of becoming effectively organised. A source close to the discussions said: \"They are concerned about decisions taken by the rich club and then they have to pick up the tab.\" The group of 77, which was originally 77 countries but was expanded to 133, has been largely moribund through lack of organisation. I It carries little weight with the G7, the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund. More than 120 of its members attended a meeting in Havana in April to look at ways of gaining more than a toehold at meetings of the rich club. Aware that they have been hampered in the past by the unwieldyness of an organisation with so many members, they agreed that a small coordinating group should meet in London. The group is to be put on a permanent footing, and may be chaired by the former Commonwealth secretary-general, Sonny Ramphal, who attended the London talks. The source said: \"The problem in the past was that it was an amorphous group. They want a tight group to do business.\" The G77 is less political than the Non-Aligned Movement and more focused on influencing the big international economic bodies. The source added: \"They want informal influence at the WTO and IMF rather than long speeches at the UN.\" The leaders were privately infuriated that Mr Mbeki, a member of the core group though he was absent from the London meeting, was virtually ignored when he attended the G7 meeting in Okinawa last month. The London meeting, held at the Nigerian residence, was organised by Mr Obasanjo, who is emerging as one of the leaders of the developing world. President Clinton, in recognition of Mr Obasanjo's growing importance, is to visit Nigeria tomorrow. As a first test of their political strength, the members agreed to present a special report to the UN millennium summit in New York next month. The report, which will not be published until seen by all G77 leaders, deals mainly with trade and the environment.

Students might increasingly find themselves having to rely on their temporary catering and bar jobs for longer than they expected. Access to higher education will become increasingly important in the future. With wage differentials between the top and bottom rising, and with most of the training at work going to people who already have qualifications, the price of missing out will become ever higher. For those who do get in, a degree is no longer a passport to a top job, but it will at least be a way into a much-expanded range of white-collar jobs, including many that were not around when their parents left school. Nick Burkitt is researcher on the future of work at the Institute for Public Policy Research.",

      "body": "<p>An antiques dealer from Arizona is to dig in a Swansea park for treasure he knows he buried in a previous life 200 years ago but cannot remember where.</p> <p>Jim Bethe, 58, says he has discovered through regression therapy that he had been there before as a Welsh soldier who had an active military career before dying on the battlefield at Waterloo in 1815.</p> <p>He is now in Scotland having scenes from his previous existence recreated on film. But he will soon be heading for Singleton Park in Swansea, armed with a shovel and the conviction that his case is one of the best potential proofs of the possibility of reincarnation.</p> <p>\"We have been approached on the possibility of some previously buried artefacts being recovered,\" said a city council spokeswoman as if this sort of thing happened every day.</p> <p>\"The dig will cover approximately four square metres in a park of 131 acres and the site will be reinstated once the dig has concluded.\"</p> <p>Mr Bethe believes he was previously John Seaman, born somewhere in Britain in 1779. Twenty years later, he was involved in a fierce battle in India during which he raided the palace of the Sultan of Tippoo.</p> <p>He stole a casket packed with jewels. He killed two guards but was stabbed in the back. (Mr Bethe bears on his back a birthmark which conforms to a scar made by a sword.)</p> <p>Mr Seaman came home to Swansea, hid his loot, and married Mary Merton in 1804 or 1805. Mary died in childbirth and their only child was killed by lightning at the age of five.</p> <p>Seaman went back to India, was recognised in Poonah as a thief, set upon and left for dead. But he survived, went back to Europe and died in Wellington's army, says Mr Bethe.</p> <p>\"Mr Bethe first made contact with us in 1989,\" said Malcolm Ridge, chairman of the Gower Society, a local conservation and history group. \"He said someone from his family had lived in the area 200 years ago and asked whether we could help.</p> <p>\"We corresponded and then he said he had something to confess. 'This relative is me in a former life,' he said. Which was something of a surprise.\"</p> <p>With the help of a Welsh diviner, Mr Bethe located a site in Clyne Park in Swansea, began digging and found the remains of a building. It turned out to be the cesspit of a Victorian castle built some years after Seaman died.</p> <p>Undaunted, he tried to persuade Steven Spielberg to film his story, which has now been taken up by the Manchester-based production company Activmedia.</p> <p>\"I approach this from a cynical standpoint,\" said the director, Simon Westland. \"It's easy not to believe but there is some very compelling evidence to show that Jim is genuine. We are trying to pin down the historical facts to give the story more credibility.\"</p> <p>Mr Seaman was unavailable for comment last night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An antiques dealer from Arizona is to dig in a Swansea park for treasure he knows he buried in a previous life 200 years ago but cannot remember where. Jim Bethe, 58, says he has discovered through regression therapy that he had been there before as a Welsh soldier who had an active military career before dying on the battlefield at Waterloo in 1815. He is now in Scotland having scenes from his previous existence recreated on film. But he will soon be heading for Singleton Park in Swansea, armed with a shovel and the conviction that his case is one of the best potential proofs of the possibility of reincarnation. \"We have been approached on the possibility of some previously buried artefacts being recovered,\" said a city council spokeswoman as if this sort of thing happened every day. \"The dig will cover approximately four square metres in a park of 131 acres and the site will be reinstated once the dig has concluded.\" Mr Bethe believes he was previously John Seaman, born somewhere in Britain in 1779. Twenty years later, he was involved in a fierce battle in India during which he raided the palace of the Sultan of Tippoo. He stole a casket packed with jewels. He killed two guards but was stabbed in the back. (Mr Bethe bears on his back a birthmark which conforms to a scar made by a sword.) Mr Seaman came home to Swansea, hid his loot, and married Mary Merton in 1804 or 1805. Mary died in childbirth and their only child was killed by lightning at the age of five. Seaman went back to India, was recognised in Poonah as a thief, set upon and left for dead. But he survived, went back to Europe and died in Wellington's army, says Mr Bethe. \"Mr Bethe first made contact with us in 1989,\" said Malcolm Ridge, chairman of the Gower Society, a local conservation and history group. \"He said someone from his family had lived in the area 200 years ago and asked whether we could help. \"We corresponded and then he said he had something to confess. 'This relative is me in a former life,' he said. Which was something of a surprise.\" With the help of a Welsh diviner, Mr Bethe located a site in Clyne Park in Swansea, began digging and found the remains of a building. It turned out to be the cesspit of a Victorian castle built some years after Seaman died. Undaunted, he tried to persuade Steven Spielberg to film his story, which has now been taken up by the Manchester-based production company Activmedia. \"I approach this from a cynical standpoint,\" said the director, Simon Westland. \"It's easy not to believe but there is some very compelling evidence to show that Jim is genuine. We are trying to pin down the historical facts to give the story more credibility.\" Mr Seaman was unavailable for comment last night.",

They allow the militia to act with impunity and have not bothered to disarm the militias or arrest those responsible for the terror, intimidation and beatings.\"</p> <p>Two recent incidents exemplify the Indonesian army's attitude to the militia and the UNHCR. A day after seizing about a dozen semi-automatic rifles in a sweep of refugee camps around Atambua earlier this month, the army returned the weapons. The commander said he was afraid there would be a riot if he did not give them back.</p> <p>His counterpart in Kefamenanu, a town 55 miles west of Atambua, said this week that the UNHCR would only be allowed to keep vehicles on his base, as a security precaution, if they paid him rent for the parking spaces.</p> <p>The armed forces have made no concerted effort to stop the militiamen blocking the main road from Atambua to the East Timorese border.</p> <p>These barricades have been erected not only to stop the refugees sneaking back home, but also to starve the East Timorese into yielding to the militia's demands, according to a militiaman armed with a machete on one roadblock.</p> <p>\"[East Timorese leader] Xanana [Gusmao] said he would be happy to be independent even if he has to eat stones,\" he said. \"Well, let's see how they feel when we force them to really eat stones and drink their own piss.\"</p> <p>The militia's guerrilla war in East Timor began in April with short, sharp hit-and-run raids on communities just across the border. Now their its involve sending squads of well-armed and well-trained fighters deeper into the territory. At least eight are known to be operating at the moment, some as far as 60 miles into East Timor.</p> <p><b> Bitter fruit of darkness</b><br></p> <p>\"The ones in our area are like Japanese ninjas,\" UN soldier in East Timor said. \"They are dressed all in black with white neckscarves. They carry modern weapons and lots of ammunition.\"</p> <p>So far the militia squads have not singled out civilians, except for food, and have killed only two international peacekeepers. But they have caused fear in many communities.</p> <p>It is unclear who is leading the militia. Diplomatic sources in Jakarta say they have accumulated conclusive evidence that several elements of the Indonesian army,particularly the special forces, are the driving force behind the campaign.</p> <p>The UN administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieria de Mello, says he is confident that the threat will not last long. \"They are and will be made ever more irrelevant here and in Indonesia,\" he told local politicians this week. \"They belong to the past when irrational violence and force of weapons, not arguments, prevailed. They were the bitter fruit of darkness, and they shall return to it.\"</p> <p>But feelings in West Timor are more sombre. \"Unless the Indonesian government shows serious political will, the refugees could be stuck here for at least another year,\" Mr Morland said.</p> <p>The Indonesian deputy foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, admits there is a crisis but says it is very difficult to solve. \"This is not just a simple case of dealing with a few thugs,\" he said during a tour of East and West Timor this week. \"It is a complex problem involving many social issues, so what we need is a comprehensive solution.\"</p> <p>He proposes to greatly increase the number of Indonesian security troops in the border region to deal with the militia threat,close the camps, and put the refugees into transit centres for eventual return to East Timor or settlement in in Indonesia, according to their wishes.</p> <p>\"Our problem is that we do not have enough resources and so we are appealing to the international community for help,\" he said.</p> <p>But the international community is not backing the plan as it stands. \"If they close the camps forcibly, against the wishes of the refugees, it could be catastrophic,\" Mr Morland said.</p> <p>Meanwhile' tens of thousands of innocent victims like Marietta Soares continue to suffer.</p> <p>\"We aren't politicians,\" she said. \"We are just simple people who want to go home.\"</p>",

They allow the militia to act with impunity and have not bothered to disarm the militias or arrest those responsible for the terror, intimidation and beatings.\" Two recent incidents exemplify the Indonesian army's attitude to the militia and the UNHCR. A day after seizing about a dozen semi-automatic rifles in a sweep of refugee camps around Atambua earlier this month, the army returned the weapons. The commander said he was afraid there would be a riot if he did not give them back. His counterpart in Kefamenanu, a town 55 miles west of Atambua, said this week that the UNHCR would only be allowed to keep vehicles on his base, as a security precaution, if they paid him rent for the parking spaces. The armed forces have made no concerted effort to stop the militiamen blocking the main road from Atambua to the East Timorese border. These barricades have been erected not only to stop the refugees sneaking back home, but also to starve the East Timorese into yielding to the militia's demands, according to a militiaman armed with a machete on one roadblock. \"[East Timorese leader] Xanana [Gusmao] said he would be happy to be independent even if he has to eat stones,\" he said. \"Well, let's see how they feel when we force them to really eat stones and drink their own piss.\" The militia's guerrilla war in East Timor began in April with short, sharp hit-and-run raids on communities just across the border. Now their its involve sending squads of well-armed and well-trained fighters deeper into the territory. At least eight are known to be operating at the moment, some as far as 60 miles into East Timor. Bitter fruit of darkness \"The ones in our area are like Japanese ninjas,\" UN soldier in East Timor said. \"They are dressed all in black with white neckscarves. They carry modern weapons and lots of ammunition.\" So far the militia squads have not singled out civilians, except for food, and have killed only two international peacekeepers. But they have caused fear in many communities. It is unclear who is leading the militia. Diplomatic sources in Jakarta say they have accumulated conclusive evidence that several elements of the Indonesian army,particularly the special forces, are the driving force behind the campaign. The UN administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieria de Mello, says he is confident that the threat will not last long. \"They are and will be made ever more irrelevant here and in Indonesia,\" he told local politicians this week. \"They belong to the past when irrational violence and force of weapons, not arguments, prevailed. They were the bitter fruit of darkness, and they shall return to it.\" But feelings in West Timor are more sombre. \"Unless the Indonesian government shows serious political will, the refugees could be stuck here for at least another year,\" Mr Morland said. The Indonesian deputy foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, admits there is a crisis but says it is very difficult to solve. \"This is not just a simple case of dealing with a few thugs,\" he said during a tour of East and West Timor this week. \"It is a complex problem involving many social issues, so what we need is a comprehensive solution.\" He proposes to greatly increase the number of Indonesian security troops in the border region to deal with the militia threat,close the camps, and put the refugees into transit centres for eventual return to East Timor or settlement in in Indonesia, according to their wishes. \"Our problem is that we do not have enough resources and so we are appealing to the international community for help,\" he said. But the international community is not backing the plan as it stands. \"If they close the camps forcibly, against the wishes of the refugees, it could be catastrophic,\" Mr Morland said. Meanwhile' tens of thousands of innocent victims like Marietta Soares continue to suffer. \"We aren't politicians,\" she said. \"We are just simple people who want to go home.\"",

They do not understand its sacredness.

Soon afterwards, in 1961, the United Nations placed coca on schedule one, branding it one of the most dangerous and restricted drugs. Of course, this had no effect on US cocaine use, as executives snorted lines while the ghettos opted for its cheaper and more dangerous relative, crack. By the 80s, more than half the world's cocaine was being consumed by the superpower, which has just 5% of the global population. Bolivia, one of the world's poorest nations, saw an opening in the market and filled it. It was to become the world's second largest producer of coca and cocaine paste.</p> <p>Now, under the concerted eradication first initiated by Ronald Reagan in his war on drugs, it is payback time. Bolivia is being punished for its recent complicity with the destruction of its ancient culture.</p> <p>Not without a fight, however. \"Go home Yankees!\" shouts a furious Quechua woman in a bright shawl and bowler hat, marching with hundreds of others under banners calling for farmers' human rights to be respected. The helicopter keeps its distance, and the DEA officials rarely show their faces outside the confines of the nearby army base.</p> <p>Zenon Cruz denies supplying the drug barons with his coca, but admits there were plenty who did. At the height of the trade, light aircraft landed regularly on these roads to pick up consignments. \"But they are punishing us all - legal and illegal together - and everyone is struggling,\" he says.</p> <p>Coca, a hardy plant ideally suited to tired or eroded soil, could produce three or four harvests a year. Now forced to grow beans and oranges instead, as part of a US-funded \"alternative development\" plan, Zenon must feed his family on a fraction of his former income. \"You can fill a lorry with oranges and not sell any of them at market, but coca always sells like hot bread,\" he says. \"I was making 150 bolivianos [about \u00a320] a week before they cut down the coca. Now we sometimes struggle to make 20 [\u00a33]. How can you feed a family on that?\"</p> <p>Other families still risk everything for a higher income. A few miles down the road, at the military base in Chimore, a 16-year-old local girl is being paraded before the press. Alcira Marin has just cracked after three days of interrogation and admitted to smuggling coca paste inside her body. The evidence lies in 40 pellets wrapped in yellowed clingfilm, on a table beside her. \"I was paid 300 bolivianos [\u00a340] to do it,\" she mumbles. \"I didn't know I would die if one broke inside me.\" Under the country's harsh and US-influenced Law 1008, she faces between five and eight years in prison.</p> <p>Later, in thick jungle barely 10 minutes walk from the main trunk road, Captain Luis Castro, of Bolivia's elite US-funded counter-narcotics police force, Umopar, shows me a cocaine pit his patrol have discovered this morning. In a six-metre polythene trough, heaps of fresh coca leaves lie half-trodden into greenish pulp, while older, browner leaves are piled a metre high at the edge of the jungle clearing. The workers, whoever they were, have disappeared, probably warned by two-way radio. \"Burn it!\" says Castro to his khaki-clad men, who begin scooping gasoline from a plastic separation tank hung between stakes.</p> <p>\"Judging by the amount of used coca here, I'd say they were working constantly for about three months,\" he tells me. Typically, eight men would stomp around this trough for 12 hours to turn more than 350kg of leaves, mixed with kerosene, into 1kg of pastabase, the crude paste from which cocaine must in turn be refined. Most would expect to earn up to \u00a33 an hour, which is certainly tempting when you compare it with \u00a33 a week for growing oranges.</p> <p>At an order from Castro, a man pulls the pin on an incendiary bomb and tosses it into the centre of the pit, sending flames and smoke billowing upwards towards the jungle canopy. \"We use their own gasoline to put them out of business,\" says Castro, whose cohorts have destroyed 275 similar pits in the first six months of this year alone. \"We're not going to lose to the drugs people.\"</p> <p>There is no doubt that the net is tightening, but the effect may simply be to drive up prices and encourage new markets elsewhere. Anti-drugs police estimate that the little more than three tons of pastabase will leave the Chapare this year, but this alone will generate some $4m, thanks to a 300% price increase over the last three years. Critics of the eradication policy argue that it will simply drive producers further into the Bolivian Amazon region, or elsewhere in South America where an estimated 2.5m square miles lie ripe for production.</p> <p>\"It's simply the law of supply and demand,\" says Kathryn Ledebur, co-ordinator of the Andean Information Network, a human rights watchdog publicising problems with the eradication effort. \"It's pointless trying to stop production in the producer countries - the place to fight it is where the market is.\" The bigger picture is indeed discouraging. While Bolivia has fallen from second to third largest cocaine exporter behind Colombia and Peru, there has been almost no reduction in the amount of cocaine exported to the US and Europe, according to the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board. The explanation is that production has increased in Brazil and Colombia, where the governments have little control over their tropical territories.</p> <p>\"It's an obvious case of the balloon theory in operation,\" says Ledebur, who is an American. \"You squeeze it in one place and it'll just expand in another unless you tackle root demand. Instead we've got a war focused on the poor people, and it is not working.\"</p> <p>On a terraced hillside in the fertile Yungas valleys on the other side of the country, a small boy dressed in traditional poncho and woollen cap kneels to make his offering to Pachamama, or mother nature. As he unwraps a cloth full of coca leaves, lights an incense burner and sprinkles alcohol on the ground, other children come forward to sing in Quechua:</p> <p>Green coca, you are born of our land/Your fragrance makes us sing happily/In the fields among the mountains/My little coca leaf is sweet medicine/Not a drug that does damage/We suck your juices for help in our work.</p> <p>It is part celebration, part pre-emptive protest. The families of this region, the last remaining place of legal coca cultivation in Bolivia, know things could easily go the way of the Chapare for them. While Law 1008 currently provides for 12,000 hectares for traditional coca-growing and distribution in the Yungas, US officials have been arguing that less than half that is needed for chewing or ritual uses. \"There is evidence that Yungas coca is being diverted to the illicit market for conversion to cocaine products,\" says the latest US embassy report on counter-narcotics. Local people believe that if they give in now, the North Americans will simply carry on demanding more until nothing is left.</p> <p>Eradication was supposed to begin here later this year, until the country exploded in violent protests over the issue in April. Coca growers dynamited the only road into the region, and the eradicators backed off - until next year. A tense impasse continues, but nobody has any illusions that they will be back.</p> <p>\"The child in the US learns that he must buy things in order to be happy, whether it's Nike trainers or a gramme of cocaine,\" says Javier Castro, curator of the coca museum in La Paz. \"That's the root of the problem, and everyone knows if they can't get their drugs here, they will just go somewhere else. In the meantime, they want to wipe out coca completely - it's a kind of cultural genocide. It's going to be as if we have no soul, no spirit.\"</p> <p>Castro is one of many who have fought to have the coca leaf recognised as a potential health product rather than a schedule one drug. Western backpackers here drink coca tea constantly to ward off altitude sickness, and a Harvard University study found that 100g of Bolivian coca more than satisfied the recommended daily allowances of calcium, iron, phosphorus, vitamin A and riboflavin.</p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, the burst of energy it gives comes not from the 0.5 cocaine content - this is in fact destroyed by saliva in the digestive tract, which is why cocaine users must snort or inject - but from its conversion of carbohydrates into glucose, and its stimulation of the respiratory system.</p> <p>With at least 30 coca products already available in Bolivia, ranging from toothpaste to pick-me-up pastilles, campaigners argue that there is considerable potential for salvaging the livelihoods of many thousands of poor farmers by marketing the plant in the west.</p> <p>But the only company which has managed to get round the ban is the Stepan company of the US. In one of the howling ironies of the coca war, it legally imports 175,000 kilos of Chapare coca each year to manufacture, among other things, a de-cocainised flavouring for Coca-Cola.</p>",

The evidence lies in 40 pellets wrapped in yellowed clingfilm, on a table beside her. \"I was paid 300 bolivianos [\u00a340] to do it,\" she mumbles. \"I didn't know I would die if one broke inside me.\" Under the country's harsh and US-influenced Law 1008, she faces between five and eight years in prison. Later, in thick jungle barely 10 minutes walk from the main trunk road, Captain Luis Castro, of Bolivia's elite US-funded counter-narcotics police force, Umopar, shows me a cocaine pit his patrol have discovered this morning. In a six-metre polythene trough, heaps of fresh coca leaves lie half-trodden into greenish pulp, while older, browner leaves are piled a metre high at the edge of the jungle clearing. The workers, whoever they were, have disappeared, probably warned by two-way radio. \"Burn it!\" says Castro to his khaki-clad men, who begin scooping gasoline from a plastic separation tank hung between stakes. \"Judging by the amount of used coca here, I'd say they were working constantly for about three months,\" he tells me. Typically, eight men would stomp around this trough for 12 hours to turn more than 350kg of leaves, mixed with kerosene, into 1kg of pastabase, the crude paste from which cocaine must in turn be refined. Most would expect to earn up to \u00a33 an hour, which is certainly tempting when you compare it with \u00a33 a week for growing oranges. At an order from Castro, a man pulls the pin on an incendiary bomb and tosses it into the centre of the pit, sending flames and smoke billowing upwards towards the jungle canopy. \"We use their own gasoline to put them out of business,\" says Castro, whose cohorts have destroyed 275 similar pits in the first six months of this year alone. \"We're not going to lose to the drugs people.\" There is no doubt that the net is tightening, but the effect may simply be to drive up prices and encourage new markets elsewhere. Anti-drugs police estimate that the little more than three tons of pastabase will leave the Chapare this year, but this alone will generate some $4m, thanks to a 300% price increase over the last three years. Critics of the eradication policy argue that it will simply drive producers further into the Bolivian Amazon region, or elsewhere in South America where an estimated 2.5m square miles lie ripe for production. \"It's simply the law of supply and demand,\" says Kathryn Ledebur, co-ordinator of the Andean Information Network, a human rights watchdog publicising problems with the eradication effort. \"It's pointless trying to stop production in the producer countries - the place to fight it is where the market is.\" The bigger picture is indeed discouraging. While Bolivia has fallen from second to third largest cocaine exporter behind Colombia and Peru, there has been almost no reduction in the amount of cocaine exported to the US and Europe, according to the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board. The explanation is that production has increased in Brazil and Colombia, where the governments have little control over their tropical territories. \"It's an obvious case of the balloon theory in operation,\" says Ledebur, who is an American. \"You squeeze it in one place and it'll just expand in another unless you tackle root demand. Instead we've got a war focused on the poor people, and it is not working.\" On a terraced hillside in the fertile Yungas valleys on the other side of the country, a small boy dressed in traditional poncho and woollen cap kneels to make his offering to Pachamama, or mother nature. As he unwraps a cloth full of coca leaves, lights an incense burner and sprinkles alcohol on the ground, other children come forward to sing in Quechua: Green coca, you are born of our land/Your fragrance makes us sing happily/In the fields among the mountains/My little coca leaf is sweet medicine/Not a drug that does damage/We suck your juices for help in our work. It is part celebration, part pre-emptive protest. The families of this region, the last remaining place of legal coca cultivation in Bolivia, know things could easily go the way of the Chapare for them. While Law 1008 currently provides for 12,000 hectares for traditional coca-growing and distribution in the Yungas, US officials have been arguing that less than half that is needed for chewing or ritual uses. \"There is evidence that Yungas coca is being diverted to the illicit market for conversion to cocaine products,\" says the latest US embassy report on counter-narcotics. Local people believe that if they give in now, the North Americans will simply carry on demanding more until nothing is left. Eradication was supposed to begin here later this year, until the country exploded in violent protests over the issue in April. Coca growers dynamited the only road into the region, and the eradicators backed off - until next year. A tense impasse continues, but nobody has any illusions that they will be back. \"The child in the US learns that he must buy things in order to be happy, whether it's Nike trainers or a gramme of cocaine,\" says Javier Castro, curator of the coca museum in La Paz. \"That's the root of the problem, and everyone knows if they can't get their drugs here, they will just go somewhere else. In the meantime, they want to wipe out coca completely - it's a kind of cultural genocide. It's going to be as if we have no soul, no spirit.\" Castro is one of many who have fought to have the coca leaf recognised as a potential health product rather than a schedule one drug. Western backpackers here drink coca tea constantly to ward off altitude sickness, and a Harvard University study found that 100g of Bolivian coca more than satisfied the recommended daily allowances of calcium, iron, phosphorus, vitamin A and riboflavin. Contrary to popular belief, the burst of energy it gives comes not from the 0.5 cocaine content - this is in fact destroyed by saliva in the digestive tract, which is why cocaine users must snort or inject - but from its conversion of carbohydrates into glucose, and its stimulation of the respiratory system. With at least 30 coca products already available in Bolivia, ranging from toothpaste to pick-me-up pastilles, campaigners argue that there is considerable potential for salvaging the livelihoods of many thousands of poor farmers by marketing the plant in the west. But the only company which has managed to get round the ban is the Stepan company of the US. In one of the howling ironies of the coca war, it legally imports 175,000 kilos of Chapare coca each year to manufacture, among other things, a de-cocainised flavouring for Coca-Cola.",

Nor have previous similar demonstrations been \"riots\". I was in Seattle for the protest which shut down the World Trade Organisation meeting last November. It was an inspiring show of unity by trade unionists, students, peace activists, environmentalists, women's groups and pensioners against the WTO and its priorities.</p> <p>Thousands are going to Prague because they believe people should come before profit. The IMF-World Bank policies of enforcing debt repayments cause the deaths of 19,000 children in the third world every day. The protests in Seattle, Washington, Millau, Los Angeles and the one to come in Prague are a sign of a rising mood against the cruelty, injustice and violence of the world system.</p> <p>Charlie Kimber, London</p> <p>\u0095Why are there \"fears\" of a huge protest at the IMF summit in Prague, rather than hopes? Why might it be the \"worst so far\", rather than the best? Does the Guardian's world view completely exclude the possibility of massive demonstrations against global capitalism being a good thing?</p> <p>Paul Deacon, Worthing, W Sussex</p> <p>\u0095We take strong issue with Oxfam's allegation that the debt relief package for Zambia under the HIPC initiative is a \"fraud\" (Debt relief leaving the poor worse off, says Oxfam, August 21). On the contrary, the initiative will reduce Zambia's external debt by 60-65%, and debt service payments in 2001 will be cut as a result of the initiative from nearly $600m to $225m. After 2001, Zambia's debt service payments are projected to drop sharply further, to reach single digits as a percentage of exports from 2005 on.</p> <p>It is true that, despite these efforts, debt service payments next year will be higher than this year, because of repayments to the IMF, which have been zero for a number of years. But this, of course, is not a proper basis for an assessment of the impact of HIPC.</p> <p>I would note, however, that the IMF is front-loading its HIPC assistance to Zambia, providing close to 60% of all HIPC initiative assistance in 2001-02. It is also looking for additional ways to reduce the burden. And in any event, Zambia will be receiving more money from the IMF than it will be repaying.</p> <p>Moreover, Oxfam is taking an unduly narrow view by ignoring the fact that grants and new concessional lending - on top of the HIPC initiative - are expected to provide an amount more than double Zambia's debt service in 2001.</p> <p>If they are used appropriately, these funds can start to reverse some of the deterioration in human development indicators cited by Oxfam, ensuring that the poor are better off.</p> <p>Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, International Monetary Fund</p>",

      "bodyText": "The protest planned for next month in Prague is not about looking for a fight with the police or trashing McDonald's, contrary to the impression given in your report (Riots threaten Prague autumn, August 24). Nor have previous similar demonstrations been \"riots\". I was in Seattle for the protest which shut down the World Trade Organisation meeting last November. It was an inspiring show of unity by trade unionists, students, peace activists, environmentalists, women's groups and pensioners against the WTO and its priorities. Thousands are going to Prague because they believe people should come before profit. The IMF-World Bank policies of enforcing debt repayments cause the deaths of 19,000 children in the third world every day. The protests in Seattle, Washington, Millau, Los Angeles and the one to come in Prague are a sign of a rising mood against the cruelty, injustice and violence of the world system. Charlie Kimber, London \u0095Why are there \"fears\" of a huge protest at the IMF summit in Prague, rather than hopes? Why might it be the \"worst so far\", rather than the best? Does the Guardian's world view completely exclude the possibility of massive demonstrations against global capitalism being a good thing? Paul Deacon, Worthing, W Sussex \u0095We take strong issue with Oxfam's allegation that the debt relief package for Zambia under the HIPC initiative is a \"fraud\" (Debt relief leaving the poor worse off, says Oxfam, August 21). On the contrary, the initiative will reduce Zambia's external debt by 60-65%, and debt service payments in 2001 will be cut as a result of the initiative from nearly $600m to $225m. After 2001, Zambia's debt service payments are projected to drop sharply further, to reach single digits as a percentage of exports from 2005 on. It is true that, despite these efforts, debt service payments next year will be higher than this year, because of repayments to the IMF, which have been zero for a number of years. But this, of course, is not a proper basis for an assessment of the impact of HIPC. I would note, however, that the IMF is front-loading its HIPC assistance to Zambia, providing close to 60% of all HIPC initiative assistance in 2001-02. It is also looking for additional ways to reduce the burden. And in any event, Zambia will be receiving more money from the IMF than it will be repaying. Moreover, Oxfam is taking an unduly narrow view by ignoring the fact that grants and new concessional lending - on top of the HIPC initiative - are expected to provide an amount more than double Zambia's debt service in 2001. If they are used appropriately, these funds can start to reverse some of the deterioration in human development indicators cited by Oxfam, ensuring that the poor are better off.

      "body": "<p>Few men in their early 20s can afford fearsome, ferocious, and far from frugal motor cars. But the chap in the staff car park of ARM Holdings, a company that did not exist just 10 years ago yet is now a constituent of the FTSE-100 index, had every reason to be sanguine about the probable pattern of his life. 'One hopes to become a millionaire,' he says. 'I am a design engineer.' </p> <p> Corporate car parks can occasionally reveal much about the character of the bus and train dodgers who use them. The vehicles in the staff car park at ARM Holdings, on the outskirts of Cambridge, now a boom town, resemble those to be found at the nearby university, where there is a distaste for demonstrative wealth. At ARM, the resident millionaires seem to prefer scruff and dust, rather than the gleam machine of the design engineer.</p> <p> ARM, then, makes millionaires, but it makes nothing that most of us could regard as a product. ARM is an 'intellectual property' enterprise, and its business is the design of silicon chips. The company's assets are its people, patent portfolio, design methods and experience rather than physical assets. The last annual report says on the cover: 'Chances are that you have just used an ARM Powered product within the last hour, minute or second'.</p> <p> It is not an idle boast. The microchips that the company designs are found in a variety of consumer products, ranging from cars to mobile telephones and from fax machines to refrigerators. ARM is the world leader in its field and its recent elevation into the FTSE 100 index reflects the breathtaking rating that the investment community affords the company, now thought to have made millionaires of 40 per cent of its 500-strong staff.</p> <p> The company is capitalised at some \u00a37,494 million, yet pre-tax profits in 1999 were just \u00a318.8 million. But 1999 profits rose by 85 per cent on the previous year and the only unknown about this year's outcome is the extent to which profits will leave last year's total in the shade. Results for the June quarter showed a 117 per cent increase in pre-tax profits - a gain achieved on a 60 per cent rise in sales to \u00a323.1 million during the period. Both figures exceeded analysts' forecasts, but this is something the company achieves regularly.</p> <p> With its shares trading at more than 400 times last year's earnings, ARM is outrageously expensive. Yet on release of the latest profit figures last month, the company's fan club in the City gained plenty more recruits as the price moved upwards in appreciation of the outcome. Indeed, one organ, the Times, commented remarkably that the shares were worth holding 'at any price'.</p> <p> By the beginning of the August holidays, however, these new club members surely rued the taking out of their chequebooks, for the price took a sudden pounding - at one stage down 14 per cent in just two weeks. The shares are currently at 662p, having traded at between 173p and 1005p over the last 12 months. The killjoy was largely Nokia, the Finnish mobile telephone manufacturer, which not only dominates the Helsinki stock exchange but has grown to a size where it now ranks as the most valued quoted enterprise in Europe.</p> <p> Nokia wrong-footed the markets with an unexpected profits warning, and analysts scurried to retrieve their reputations by downgrading profit predictions for all manner of communications groups. The malaise was then compounded by Motorola - after Nokia, the world's second-largest mobile telephone manufacturer - which said it would slash this year's production by a prodigious 15 million units and, as a result, profit figures would be lower than the investment community had hitherto anticipated.</p> <p> One broker, Nomura Securities, says ARM earnings will have to rise by some 40 per cent a year if the current rating is to be justified. Nomura's Keith Woolcock, who has long argued that the rating is excessive, took comfort from the Nokia and Motorola figures and explains: 'ARM has one of the strongest business models out there but it is overvalued. It is a classic separation between the share price and a great company.' </p> <p> But markets are a two-way bet and, right now, Woolcock's view is far from universal, since some believe that ARM will indeed achieve annual growth of two-score or more. The company has made a habit of beating the market's expectations, and the outcome of the latest quarterly results is no exception.</p> <p> 'We can't sit here and say we have made it,' says James Urquhart, ARM's chief operating officer, an Americanism that translates as managing director. 'The biggest competition we face is ourselves. We have got to keep evolving the technology: we want to be the architects for the digital world and we have a big vision, but as Mike Dell [chairman and CEO of Dell Computer] said: \"Don't breathe your own exhaust\".' As for his view on the share price, Urquhart does not have one he will share with the rest of us.</p> <p> ARM licenses its products to some 44 manufacturers and, in addition, it receives royalties from on-going sales. The list of customers reads like a Who's Who of the wired world: Epson, IBM, Panasonic, Microsoft, Toshiba, Yamaha, Sony, Samsung and so on.</p> <p> However, only 21 of the 44 customers are now shipping products that incorporate ARM's technology. In part, this is explained by the rapid pace of technological development. Hitherto, chips for consumer appliances tended to be very simple and often made by the same firm that made the appliance. But the new generation requires much more processing power, and ARM's strengths - protected by copyright patents - are the performance of its designs plus affordability. Some 15 per cent of sales are now for so-called 'development systems'. These are software packages used by engineers who are employed by ARM's customers. They help them create integrated chip systems for products based around ARM technology. The high level of development systems sales indicates that manufacturers are preparing to ship increasing volumes of goods that will incorporate ARM products.</p> <p> Urquhart, 43, has been with ARM since the company was founded. 'There is no one hero here,' he says. 'It is teams of people that make things happen.' Originally called Advanced Risc Machines, ARM was a joint venture between Acorn, one of Britain's personal computer companies, and US companies Apple and VSLI. The idea, inspired by Hermann Hausser, a founder of Acorn and one of Britain's foremost venture capitalists, was to design Risc chips (Risc stands for reduced instruction set computing). Essentially, they are faster, cheaper and more efficient than conventional chips.</p> <p> 'Cambridge was inward-looking in those days.

      "bodyText": "Few men in their early 20s can afford fearsome, ferocious, and far from frugal motor cars. But the chap in the staff car park of ARM Holdings, a company that did not exist just 10 years ago yet is now a constituent of the FTSE-100 index, had every reason to be sanguine about the probable pattern of his life. 'One hopes to become a millionaire,' he says. 'I am a design engineer.' Corporate car parks can occasionally reveal much about the character of the bus and train dodgers who use them. The vehicles in the staff car park at ARM Holdings, on the outskirts of Cambridge, now a boom town, resemble those to be found at the nearby university, where there is a distaste for demonstrative wealth. At ARM, the resident millionaires seem to prefer scruff and dust, rather than the gleam machine of the design engineer. ARM, then, makes millionaires, but it makes nothing that most of us could regard as a product. ARM is an 'intellectual property' enterprise, and its business is the design of silicon chips. The company's assets are its people, patent portfolio, design methods and experience rather than physical assets. The last annual report says on the cover: 'Chances are that you have just used an ARM Powered product within the last hour, minute or second'. It is not an idle boast. The microchips that the company designs are found in a variety of consumer products, ranging from cars to mobile telephones and from fax machines to refrigerators. ARM is the world leader in its field and its recent elevation into the FTSE 100 index reflects the breathtaking rating that the investment community affords the company, now thought to have made millionaires of 40 per cent of its 500-strong staff. The company is capitalised at some \u00a37,494 million, yet pre-tax profits in 1999 were just \u00a318.8 million. But 1999 profits rose by 85 per cent on the previous year and the only unknown about this year's outcome is the extent to which profits will leave last year's total in the shade. Results for the June quarter showed a 117 per cent increase in pre-tax profits - a gain achieved on a 60 per cent rise in sales to \u00a323.1 million during the period. Both figures exceeded analysts' forecasts, but this is something the company achieves regularly. With its shares trading at more than 400 times last year's earnings, ARM is outrageously expensive. Yet on release of the latest profit figures last month, the company's fan club in the City gained plenty more recruits as the price moved upwards in appreciation of the outcome. Indeed, one organ, the Times, commented remarkably that the shares were worth holding 'at any price'. By the beginning of the August holidays, however, these new club members surely rued the taking out of their chequebooks, for the price took a sudden pounding - at one stage down 14 per cent in just two weeks. The shares are currently at 662p, having traded at between 173p and 1005p over the last 12 months. The killjoy was largely Nokia, the Finnish mobile telephone manufacturer, which not only dominates the Helsinki stock exchange but has grown to a size where it now ranks as the most valued quoted enterprise in Europe. Nokia wrong-footed the markets with an unexpected profits warning, and analysts scurried to retrieve their reputations by downgrading profit predictions for all manner of communications groups. The malaise was then compounded by Motorola - after Nokia, the world's second-largest mobile telephone manufacturer - which said it would slash this year's production by a prodigious 15 million units and, as a result, profit figures would be lower than the investment community had hitherto anticipated. One broker, Nomura Securities, says ARM earnings will have to rise by some 40 per cent a year if the current rating is to be justified. Nomura's Keith Woolcock, who has long argued that the rating is excessive, took comfort from the Nokia and Motorola figures and explains: 'ARM has one of the strongest business models out there but it is overvalued. It is a classic separation between the share price and a great company.' But markets are a two-way bet and, right now, Woolcock's view is far from universal, since some believe that ARM will indeed achieve annual growth of two-score or more. The company has made a habit of beating the market's expectations, and the outcome of the latest quarterly results is no exception. 'We can't sit here and say we have made it,' says James Urquhart, ARM's chief operating officer, an Americanism that translates as managing director. 'The biggest competition we face is ourselves. We have got to keep evolving the technology: we want to be the architects for the digital world and we have a big vision, but as Mike Dell [chairman and CEO of Dell Computer] said: \"Don't breathe your own exhaust\".' As for his view on the share price, Urquhart does not have one he will share with the rest of us. ARM licenses its products to some 44 manufacturers and, in addition, it receives royalties from on-going sales. The list of customers reads like a Who's Who of the wired world: Epson, IBM, Panasonic, Microsoft, Toshiba, Yamaha, Sony, Samsung and so on. However, only 21 of the 44 customers are now shipping products that incorporate ARM's technology. In part, this is explained by the rapid pace of technological development. Hitherto, chips for consumer appliances tended to be very simple and often made by the same firm that made the appliance. But the new generation requires much more processing power, and ARM's strengths - protected by copyright patents - are the performance of its designs plus affordability. Some 15 per cent of sales are now for so-called 'development systems'. These are software packages used by engineers who are employed by ARM's customers. They help them create integrated chip systems for products based around ARM technology. The high level of development systems sales indicates that manufacturers are preparing to ship increasing volumes of goods that will incorporate ARM products. Urquhart, 43, has been with ARM since the company was founded. 'There is no one hero here,' he says. 'It is teams of people that make things happen.' Originally called Advanced Risc Machines, ARM was a joint venture between Acorn, one of Britain's personal computer companies, and US companies Apple and VSLI. The idea, inspired by Hermann Hausser, a founder of Acorn and one of Britain's foremost venture capitalists, was to design Risc chips (Risc stands for reduced instruction set computing). Essentially, they are faster, cheaper and more efficient than conventional chips. 'Cambridge was inward-looking in those days. It has since become a magnet for venture capitalists and is no longer insular,' says Urquhart, a graduate of Bath University who originally intended a career as a nuclear physicist. He was sponsored at university by Plessey and went on to work for the company. 'At Plessey, the path from research to product was not easy. I left in 1983 to join Acorn, which was pretty advanced in its use of chip technology. The hardware was ambitious and that is what attracted me to the company. I still have an early Acorn computer in my study. Even my 11 year-old son plays with it.' ARM made an early decision not to make the chips it designed. 'Complex chips have a lot of different building blocks in them,' he says. 'It's like houses. We are producing a standard building block and it is for others to focus on adding value.

There are some 150 semiconductor manufacturers around the world and 44 of them are licensed to use ARM technology. Eight of the top 10 are customers, the exceptions being Intel and Motorola. 'We all have a fixed interest in making things happen,' says Urquhart. 'Our strength is our focus.' Two areas of particular interest to ARM are its emerging digital technology and the development of Bluetooth technology. Both are crucial to the company's medium-term prospects. Bluetooth is named after the 10th century Danish king, Harald Blatand (Bluetooth), whose famed communications skills united Norway and Denmark. Bluetooth is now the name of a piece of silicon that will allow billions of electronic devices to talk to each other via internet and intranets without unsightly cables. Relaxed about the competition Urquhart does not expect any one company to emerge with a grip on Bluetooth technology and is seemingly relaxed about the progress achieved so far by a rival company, ARC.
