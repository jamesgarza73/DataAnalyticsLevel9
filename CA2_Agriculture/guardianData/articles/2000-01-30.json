      "byline": "Ian Ridley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Starting today at Chelsea and continuing on Wednesday at home to Aston Villa, Leicester City close in on Wembley on two fronts. For the good of the game, those of us who nurse hopes of entertaining finals will hope they don't make it in either.</p> <p>We've tolerated them for a while now and partnered them with patronising adjectives of the plucky, spirited, never-say-die sort. We've accepted them because we've believed all the stuff about their meagre resources. No more. The midweek goalless draw against Aston Villa was final-straw evidence. They need outing.</p> <p>For all the spin they put on it, the reality is that Leicester City play ugly, parasitic football that is, at best, dreary to watch and which, at worst, insults the traditions of a club that has produced many great players and played much enjoyable pass-and-move football. Now we have Wimbledon with fewer excuses.</p> <p>It is easy to become seduced by Leicester. Their fans seem, by and large, a civilised, fair-minded crowd. In addition, going to Filbert Street as a journalist is an enduring pleasure, largely due to the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the staff and the best spread of food in the Premiership - soup, pies and guilt-inducing cream cakes.</p> <p>Then there is Martin O'Neill, his lilting Ulster tones adding charm to his plausible arguments about Leicester's underdog status and exhausted, injury-ravaged squad. Like Nottingham Forest before them, for whom he played so successfully under Brian Clough, his little club will take on the big boys, says O'Neill. Enough, though, of this canny managerial licence for low expectations.</p> <p>Post-War, Leicester have spent half their time in the top flight and reached the FA Cup final four times, the same as the League Cup, which they have won twice, once under O'Neill. It is hardly the record of johnny-come-latelies. Nor do average crowds of just under 20,000 suggest the Premiership paupers they claim.</p> <p>This, too, is the club of such a talented array as Gary Lineker, Alan Birchenall - now the club's jolly PA announcer - Keith Weller and Mike Stringfellow (though Peter Stringfellow would be more familiar to some of their players now). They played under such passing proponents as Matt Gillies, Jock Wallace and Gordon Milne and you could usually be assured at Filbert Street of a lively, crisp-passing game with some dribbling ball-players thrown in.</p> <p>Now you have a side that likes to lump it. If the defender is not under pressure, he will lump it at Emile Heskey. If under pressure, somewhere in Heskey's half of the field. It is Emile and the defectives.</p> <p>'You basically have to try and stop the service,' says the Aston Villa manager, John Gregory, of the task against them. 'They just love chucking things into the penalty area.' Parasitic? 'They live on that. They rely on Emile a lot. He has a major responsibility to pinch them something. And they are very hard to break down.'</p> <p>The current mitigation of Martin O'Neill for some tedious cup games that have made it look as if they are content just to hang on for penalties is that they are running on empty. They would like to be more expansive, honest. It ignores the evidence of the past three years, however.</p> <p>At first it was a good story when smiling, ragamuffin Steve Claridge lifted them the Worthington Cup against Middlesbrough in a replay in '97. Two hours of previous tedium at Wembley were forgotten, not to mention the grind of two semi-finals against Wimbledon.</p> <p>Leicester's style throughout the period seems to have been to absorb pressure, with a belt-and-braces defence of three big men at the back, and poach a goal or two through a muscular moment from Heskey, a rare chance for an expert taker of them in Tony Cottee, or from a set-piece via Matt Elliott.</p> <p>The sides who cope best are those who match them physically before their ability takes over - such as Manchester United and Arsenal; those who have difficulty are the passing but softer-centred such as this week's opponents, Chelsea and Aston Villa. </p> <p>There are bright spots. Schooled at Chelsea, Muzzy Izzet adds touches of class and Steve Guppy can supply a mean left-footed cross. They stand out, though, because of the preponderance of dross around them from such as the abrasive Robbie Savage, perpetrator of that horrible studs-up against Kanu. </p> <p>If Leicester go out of both cups today and on Wednesday, it could just be that Liverpool come knocking to see if they can advance the supposed gentleman's agreement to sign Heskey in the summer, given the current striking crisis at Anfield. It could be for the best all round.</p> <p>Heskey will get to go to a club where he is not expected to do so much donkey work but will have more of a chance to hone his impressive, ill-used raw material. O'Neill gets \u00a310 million to augment his squad with both personnel and quality and provide the finer fare he insists he wants. It might then be more of a pleasure going back to Filbert Street for some cream on the field rather than just in the cakes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Starting today at Chelsea and continuing on Wednesday at home to Aston Villa, Leicester City close in on Wembley on two fronts. For the good of the game, those of us who nurse hopes of entertaining finals will hope they don't make it in either. We've tolerated them for a while now and partnered them with patronising adjectives of the plucky, spirited, never-say-die sort. We've accepted them because we've believed all the stuff about their meagre resources. No more. The midweek goalless draw against Aston Villa was final-straw evidence. They need outing. For all the spin they put on it, the reality is that Leicester City play ugly, parasitic football that is, at best, dreary to watch and which, at worst, insults the traditions of a club that has produced many great players and played much enjoyable pass-and-move football. Now we have Wimbledon with fewer excuses. It is easy to become seduced by Leicester. Their fans seem, by and large, a civilised, fair-minded crowd. In addition, going to Filbert Street as a journalist is an enduring pleasure, largely due to the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the staff and the best spread of food in the Premiership - soup, pies and guilt-inducing cream cakes. Then there is Martin O'Neill, his lilting Ulster tones adding charm to his plausible arguments about Leicester's underdog status and exhausted, injury-ravaged squad. Like Nottingham Forest before them, for whom he played so successfully under Brian Clough, his little club will take on the big boys, says O'Neill. Enough, though, of this canny managerial licence for low expectations. Post-War, Leicester have spent half their time in the top flight and reached the FA Cup final four times, the same as the League Cup, which they have won twice, once under O'Neill. It is hardly the record of johnny-come-latelies. Nor do average crowds of just under 20,000 suggest the Premiership paupers they claim. This, too, is the club of such a talented array as Gary Lineker, Alan Birchenall - now the club's jolly PA announcer - Keith Weller and Mike Stringfellow (though Peter Stringfellow would be more familiar to some of their players now). They played under such passing proponents as Matt Gillies, Jock Wallace and Gordon Milne and you could usually be assured at Filbert Street of a lively, crisp-passing game with some dribbling ball-players thrown in. Now you have a side that likes to lump it. If the defender is not under pressure, he will lump it at Emile Heskey. If under pressure, somewhere in Heskey's half of the field. It is Emile and the defectives. 'You basically have to try and stop the service,' says the Aston Villa manager, John Gregory, of the task against them. 'They just love chucking things into the penalty area.' Parasitic? 'They live on that. They rely on Emile a lot. He has a major responsibility to pinch them something. And they are very hard to break down.' The current mitigation of Martin O'Neill for some tedious cup games that have made it look as if they are content just to hang on for penalties is that they are running on empty. They would like to be more expansive, honest. It ignores the evidence of the past three years, however. At first it was a good story when smiling, ragamuffin Steve Claridge lifted them the Worthington Cup against Middlesbrough in a replay in '97. Two hours of previous tedium at Wembley were forgotten, not to mention the grind of two semi-finals against Wimbledon. Leicester's style throughout the period seems to have been to absorb pressure, with a belt-and-braces defence of three big men at the back, and poach a goal or two through a muscular moment from Heskey, a rare chance for an expert taker of them in Tony Cottee, or from a set-piece via Matt Elliott. The sides who cope best are those who match them physically before their ability takes over - such as Manchester United and Arsenal; those who have difficulty are the passing but softer-centred such as this week's opponents, Chelsea and Aston Villa. There are bright spots. Schooled at Chelsea, Muzzy Izzet adds touches of class and Steve Guppy can supply a mean left-footed cross. They stand out, though, because of the preponderance of dross around them from such as the abrasive Robbie Savage, perpetrator of that horrible studs-up against Kanu. If Leicester go out of both cups today and on Wednesday, it could just be that Liverpool come knocking to see if they can advance the supposed gentleman's agreement to sign Heskey in the summer, given the current striking crisis at Anfield. It could be for the best all round. Heskey will get to go to a club where he is not expected to do so much donkey work but will have more of a chance to hone his impressive, ill-used raw material. O'Neill gets \u00a310 million to augment his squad with both personnel and quality and provide the finer fare he insists he wants. It might then be more of a pleasure going back to Filbert Street for some cream on the field rather than just in the cakes.",

      "body": "<p>The gossip about 18-year-old prospects from the Nationwide League swanning around in convertible Jaguars makes Paul Merson exhale. Deeply. Despondently. Knowingly. He worries about football's future while every trill of the till deadens the basic sporting impulse that little bit more. </p> <p>'You see a lot of players driving round in big cars to big houses who never have to work again and they won't win a thing in their careers. They won't even have a cabinet,' he scoffs, with an expression of derision that it has come to this. 'I don't think it's down to medals anymore as far as players are concerned. It's got ridiculous.'</p> <p>Merson accepts (extremely gratefully, he hastens to add) the benefits of an extremely comfortable salary but he also has the trinkets. Mounted at home are mementoes of Championships and Cups, of individual awards dating back to the days when he was acclaimed Young Player of the Year as a tearaway teenager living on a mass of talent, a few bob and a dream. </p> <p>That seems several lifetimes ago. Merson is honest enough to admit that he hasn't always been a paragon of virtue in terms of valuing corinthian spirit over twenty-first century hedonism, but right now there is no doubting what drives him. Taking into account his age and probable spells injured and off form he figures another 100 games would be a bonus. 'I have to make sure I enjoy every game I play because it soon goes,' he says, 'and I just want to play football.'</p> <p>Anyway, if money were the prime motivation he would hardly go to such extremes as to volunteer a wage cut: 'It's got to the stage where kids can't go to watch football anymore because they are paying players too much.

      "bodyText": "The gossip about 18-year-old prospects from the Nationwide League swanning around in convertible Jaguars makes Paul Merson exhale. Deeply. Despondently. Knowingly. He worries about football's future while every trill of the till deadens the basic sporting impulse that little bit more. 'You see a lot of players driving round in big cars to big houses who never have to work again and they won't win a thing in their careers. They won't even have a cabinet,' he scoffs, with an expression of derision that it has come to this. 'I don't think it's down to medals anymore as far as players are concerned. It's got ridiculous.' Merson accepts (extremely gratefully, he hastens to add) the benefits of an extremely comfortable salary but he also has the trinkets. Mounted at home are mementoes of Championships and Cups, of individual awards dating back to the days when he was acclaimed Young Player of the Year as a tearaway teenager living on a mass of talent, a few bob and a dream. That seems several lifetimes ago. Merson is honest enough to admit that he hasn't always been a paragon of virtue in terms of valuing corinthian spirit over twenty-first century hedonism, but right now there is no doubting what drives him. Taking into account his age and probable spells injured and off form he figures another 100 games would be a bonus. 'I have to make sure I enjoy every game I play because it soon goes,' he says, 'and I just want to play football.' Anyway, if money were the prime motivation he would hardly go to such extremes as to volunteer a wage cut: 'It's got to the stage where kids can't go to watch football anymore because they are paying players too much. I would be more than grateful to take \u00a31000 off my wages to knock prices down.' Pardon? Did a professional footballer really say that? The disarmingly direct stare - from eyes that have seen more than enough bullshit in the past - ensures this is not a hollow gesture. There is poignancy and irony in this offer coming from a man who frittered away \u00a335,000 in one month last winter to try to ease his anguish-addled mind as he relapsed into the haunting habits of old.

This was the first time he had seen his heroes in the flesh and Birmingham responded with a first-half display that was about as palatable as the day before yesterday's Vegemite sandwich. Stockport, who employed a five-man midfield, not only smothered what little City invention there was but created some chances of their own.

In contrast, the visitors' keeper Ian Gray was almost redundant.

As for City, Aussies might have described their performance as \"crook\". Trevor Francis is understood to have been less polite at half-time but his oratory and two changes in personnel did the trick. David Holdsworth headed home Martin Grainger's inswinging free-kick in the 62nd minute and Bryan Hughes added another 10 minutes later after good work by the on-loan striker Isaiah Rankin. Rankin and Hughes, who is now City's joint top scorer with eight goals, are seen as stop-gap solutions to the club's striker shortage, but along with the substitute Dele Adebola they made City a potent attacking force after the break. Not so County, who fortuitously reduced the deficit six minutes from time when Cooper's innocuous-looking cross glanced off Michael Johnson's head and looped over Bennett for an own-goal. That sparked a frantic finale but the Blues held out to send the man from Snowy River, or wherever, back home happy.

      "body": "<p>England must go into today's one-day international as rank outsiders. They have now lost 75 per cent of their one-day games with Zimbabwe, their worst record against any of the Test-playing countries. How much longer can this be regarded as a statistical blip? They have now played Zimbabwe, who are generally beaten by all the others, eight times and have lost on six occasions.</p> <p>Moreover, England's record in one-day internationals in South Africa is appalling. They have now played 10 matches there and have only ever won on the two occasions that they have been at Bloemfontein. Unfortunately, today's match against Zimbabwe is at Kimberley. The Zimbabweans must fret only about complacency.</p> <p>England have not been a shambles in the field. Darren Gough is rejuvenated by the one-day game; it is easier for him to excel in this version and his bubbliness has returned. Indeed it's unnerving to hear him say that he prefers this type of game to Test cricket. Andrew Caddick has demonstrated why he should have been in the World Cup squad and the 'bits and pieces' bowlers have performed manfully. The fielding has not suffered much in comparison with the South Africans and the Zimbabweans. It is the batting that terrifies us, especially if the first three depart early.</p> <p>Today England are likely to shuffle their pack even though there is little scope to bolster the batting; only Darren Maddy waits patiently in reserve. Ditching their best players still haunts England.

      "bodyText": "England must go into today's one-day international as rank outsiders. They have now lost 75 per cent of their one-day games with Zimbabwe, their worst record against any of the Test-playing countries. How much longer can this be regarded as a statistical blip? They have now played Zimbabwe, who are generally beaten by all the others, eight times and have lost on six occasions. Moreover, England's record in one-day internationals in South Africa is appalling. They have now played 10 matches there and have only ever won on the two occasions that they have been at Bloemfontein. Unfortunately, today's match against Zimbabwe is at Kimberley. The Zimbabweans must fret only about complacency. England have not been a shambles in the field. Darren Gough is rejuvenated by the one-day game; it is easier for him to excel in this version and his bubbliness has returned. Indeed it's unnerving to hear him say that he prefers this type of game to Test cricket. Andrew Caddick has demonstrated why he should have been in the World Cup squad and the 'bits and pieces' bowlers have performed manfully. The fielding has not suffered much in comparison with the South Africans and the Zimbabweans. It is the batting that terrifies us, especially if the first three depart early. Today England are likely to shuffle their pack even though there is little scope to bolster the batting; only Darren Maddy waits patiently in reserve. Ditching their best players still haunts England. Mike Atherton would have served the game better batting for 40 overs last week rather than popping up on Radio 5 Live with his doom-laden assessment of the English game. (Stewart would have been handy as well.) Atherton has a point about the shortcomings of English county cricket and it would be ridiculously heavy-handed if he were punished by the ECB for expressing his views, but his viewpoint cannot explain England's inability to score more than 107 against Zimbabwe on Friday. Those Zimbabwean bowlers are two a penny in county cricket and still England could not cope with them. If Maddy is introduced today he could take the place of Vikram Solanki.

But do you see qualities in other footballers that you would like to have? 'Yes, I think so. I used to try to be a copy of Zico, to try to achieve the calm he had on the pitch. Zidane is a very great player, a very calm player. Luis Figo as well, he's a player who has very good moves on the ball, who has very great speed.

The disarmingly direct stare - from eyes that have seen more than enough bullshit in the past - ensures this is not a hollow gesture.

Happily there is nothing but positives to report right now. He is feeling settled in the Midlands and in his most satisfying and effective spell in the claret and blue. Slotting into a three-man midfield alongside the irrepressible Ian Taylor and the increasingly influential George Boateng has been central to reviving his - and his club's - fortunes. </p> <p>One moment his Villa career was grinding to a halt as he was shackled to the bench while team-mates were stuck in a rut of nine Premiership matches without a win. The next he is earning rave reviews as an integral cog in a side undefeated in 10 in all competitions. 'I thought I was finished at Villa,' he recalls. 'We were 2-1 down at Coventry, I never even looked like getting on and I thought that's probably it now. I was inches away from going on loan to Nottingham Forest - just to play football. I was on the way home one day and a Villa fan rung up Radio 5 and said \"Merson's finished, he's over the hill\". That livened me up. I thought I'll show you.'</p> <p>So he knuckled down and showed us all. 'Sometimes it becomes difficult for me because everybody sees me as a playmaker. It's easy to be consistent when your job is to win the ball and give it simple. I have to chase back, win the ball and then make things happen. People say Matt Le Tissier blows hot and cold or Dennis Bergkamp's off the boil but it's impossible when you're that kind of player to produce constantly. The consistency I've managed recently has been very pleasing.</p> <p>'There is a nice balance about the team now... with me and Ian and George in midfield. But there's no doubt we're not as strong as we'd like to be up front. Just look at Manchester United and Arsenal - they've both got four strikers. That's the difference between them and the rest. I think Leeds have done brilliantly but if they still had Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink I think they'd be a lot further clear then then are now. And that's taking nothing away from Michael Bridges and Alan Smith, who have been fantastic.' </p> <p>Now a re-established force Villa face a crucial week of their season. Results against Leeds in the FA Cup and Leicester for a place in the Worthington Cup final will tilt the balance between a meaningful or mediocre season. 'On form we are the best team in the country at the moment,' Merson breezes bullishly. 'Recently we went to Leeds and won quite comfortably and we matched Chelsea. Playing well against top quality opposition gives you the confidence to go from strength to strength. We're probably in a better position today than we were this time last year, when we were out of both cup competitions and on a downward spiral in the league, but come Wednesday night we could be in a worse position. It's a big four days for us.'</p> <p>Merson is highly motivated for the challenge: 'I've never won anything since I came out of treatment and it would be a major pleasure for me if I won something again before I finish. That's why it really hurt me last Tuesday night when we couldn't take advantage at home to Leicester. I tried to get it through to the young lads - we're in a semi-final! How many times does that come around? Not too often. I was a prime example of that attitude at Arsenal. We used to get to semi-finals and finals and think, yeah, we'll get there again next year. It don't happen. It is very important for me to get to Wembley in one of the Cup Finals this year.'</p> <p>Doug Ellis couldn't conjure a win bonus that would mean half as much.</p>",

'Promotion has got to be our priority this season, any cup run will just be a very pleasant diversion.'</p> <p>Peacock admits he was not anticipating Nationwide League football when he signed for Blackburn two years ago. It is generally accepted that Rovers' slow decline (or rapid descent, depending which way you want to look at it) began when Shearer moved to Newcastle for \u00a315 million, but Peacock did not hear any alarm bells ringing when he moved in the opposite direction. </p> <p>'I thought it was a great move, and I certainly don't regret it,' he said. 'Blackburn had won the league just a few years previously, and they didn't have to sell themselves to me. </p> <p>'Leaving Newcastle at that stage wasn't exactly a wrench either. I had a fantastic time under Kevin Keegan, really I think we only realised how good that period was when it was over, but things do change in football and Kenny Dalglish made it fairly plain I was not in his plans.' Peacock enjoyed playing and training under Rovers' Roy Hodgson, and thought the team initially played some great football. How Rovers managed to go from sixth in the Premiership in 1997-98 to relegation in 1998-99 baffles him as much as it baffles Jack Walker, but he insists it wasn't for lack of effort on the part of either players or managers. If it was a simple matter to identify and correct what went wrong Brian Kidd might still be in a job and Rovers might still be in the Premiership, but at least Tony Parkes has the club moving in the right direction now. 'Results tell their own story,' Peacock said. 'Or at least they did until we went to Barnsley. It's hard to say how the gaffer has done it. He's changed training a bit, we get the ball out more now, we've just gone back to basics I suppose.' </p> <p>Had Keegan been able to change just a couple of results when Newcastle famously let a 12-point lead over Manchester United slip, both his and Peacock's careers might have turned out much differently. Peacock was left slightly irritated by all the claims that Keegan's chief failing was an inability to sort out his defence. </p> <p>'People look back at that Newcastle side and say: \"Great team, crap defence\", and that does tend to get on my nerves,' he said. 'We let a 12-point lead go, so perhaps we didn't deserve any prizes for ruthlessness, but if you look at the final table you will find we conceded just two goals more than Manchester United. It was just that there was an imbalance between the number of defenders in the team and the number of attackers. That's how Kevin wanted to play, it was great fun, and we came close, but ultimately we lost out.' Shearer would doubtless agree, but Peacock has talked enough about his former team-mate for one week. Here, for the record, is what Parkes believes his defence will be up against tomorrow night. 'Alan Shearer is still as effective as ever, and I think he likes playing with Duncan Ferguson,' the Blackburn manager said. 'He scored 90 goals in three seasons with us and he's the best player I've ever worked with. If you are a goalscorer and you are not scoring people will question whether you still have the ability, but it's a very dangerous thing to do that too soon.'</p>",

But premier league strugglers Aberdeen owed much to a lack of penetration by the first division leaders. Early on, Saint's Tom Brown hit a powerful shot. The ball smashed into the face of Andrew Dow who knew little about his unintentional clearance. Aberdeen did respond and Arild Stavrum was inches away from connecting with a Dow cross. Dow then delivered another great ball to Zerouali but Ian Ross was quicker than the Moroccan and cleared. Zerouali then forced a terrific save from Ludovic Roy with a 30-yard drive. Saints came close to opening the scoring when Brown found Junior Mendes on the edge of the area, but the striker flashed his shot just wide of Leighton's goal. At the other end, Mark Yardley almost scored a delightful opener after 31 minutes when Brown fouled him on the edge of the box. But the striker curled the free-kick just wide of the post. Yardley had another chance seconds later, but headed over from an Ian Nicholson cross. As the pressure mounted from the visitors, the lively Zerouali, looking dangerous again, crashed a drive against the crossbar after 35 minutes. Saints continued to dominate the possession, but failed to trouble Leighton. Early in the second half, the home fans were screaming for a penalty when Jamie McAllister appeared to handle Sergei Baltacha's cross. But referee Willie Young waved away the appeals. After 56 minutes, Saints were rewarded for their territorial dominance. A Barry McLaughlin free-kick was headed into the six-yard area by Yardley, where McGarry stretched out a leg to prod the ball at Leighton. McGarry was now in confident mood and tried his luck from 30 yards after 64 minutes but Whyte blocked the strike. Zerouali's trickery took him past three Saints players but Stavrum's eventual shot from his pass was weak.

And they deserved to win a cracking cup tie, despite a spirited performance from Fulham. </p> <p>There was a real Seventies feeling around Craven Cottage even before kick-off. It started when 'Diddy' David Hamilton, the pitchside announcer, played Viva El Fulham, the club anthem from the only time they reached the FA Cup final, in 1975. </p> <p>Then we saw a referee dressed in black, two teams composed mainly of British players, and a yellow ball. Once the game kicked off, the nostalgia continued and we were treated to a good old-fashioned bruising cup tie played in a swirling wind. </p> <p>Paul Bracewell, Fulham's manager, predicted Tranmere's major threat would come from the astonishingly long throw of Dave Challinor. The Tranmere defender can comfortably reach the penalty spot with his throws on a calm day, so it was no surprise to see him reaching the far post with the wind whipping up behind him. </p> <p>But it was a throw-in from the other side of the ground, with Challinor facing the wind that put Tranmere ahead in the 10th minute. Fulham's defence had seen the danger signs several times already, but failed to deal with another huge throw and Allison headed home inside the far post. </p> <p>At that stage, Fulham had hardly had an attack, but the goal stung them and they equalised eight minutes later. Steve Finnan was fouled on the left and from his free-kick, the ball was knocked back by Karl Heinz Riedle for Chris Coleman to volley home from close range. Coleman then set up Finnan on the half-hour but the midfielder saw his shot swerve the wrong side of the far post. </p> <p>The cut-and-thrust continued after the break, with Fulham having the better of it. One quick break started when Fulham's goalkeeper Maik Taylor caught a Challinor throw and set Bjarne Goldbaek away on the right. The former Chelsea midfielder produced the perfect pass for Paul Peschisolido who was clean through on goal, but Tranmere's keeper, John Achterberg, saved at the striker's feet. Ten minutes later, a superb cross-field pass from Lee Clark put Goldbaek away again. He crossed to Riedle but the ball was headed straight at Achterberg. </p> <p>Then, in the 70th minute, Tranmere regained the lead. An incisive through-ball from Alan Mahon beat Fulham's offside trap and gave Andy Parkinson the chance to run down the right and deliver a low cross for the substitute David Kelly to sweep home from close range. </p> <p>That only served to intensify the action as Fulham threw everything forward in search of an equaliser. And as they continued to press forward, Tranmere's defending became increasingly desperate. </p> <p>But in the end, it was too little, too late for Fulham and Tranmere go marching on.</p>",

The Tranmere defender can comfortably reach the penalty spot with his throws on a calm day, so it was no surprise to see him reaching the far post with the wind whipping up behind him. But it was a throw-in from the other side of the ground, with Challinor facing the wind that put Tranmere ahead in the 10th minute. Fulham's defence had seen the danger signs several times already, but failed to deal with another huge throw and Allison headed home inside the far post. At that stage, Fulham had hardly had an attack, but the goal stung them and they equalised eight minutes later. Steve Finnan was fouled on the left and from his free-kick, the ball was knocked back by Karl Heinz Riedle for Chris Coleman to volley home from close range. Coleman then set up Finnan on the half-hour but the midfielder saw his shot swerve the wrong side of the far post. The cut-and-thrust continued after the break, with Fulham having the better of it. One quick break started when Fulham's goalkeeper Maik Taylor caught a Challinor throw and set Bjarne Goldbaek away on the right. The former Chelsea midfielder produced the perfect pass for Paul Peschisolido who was clean through on goal, but Tranmere's keeper, John Achterberg, saved at the striker's feet. Ten minutes later, a superb cross-field pass from Lee Clark put Goldbaek away again. He crossed to Riedle but the ball was headed straight at Achterberg. Then, in the 70th minute, Tranmere regained the lead. An incisive through-ball from Alan Mahon beat Fulham's offside trap and gave Andy Parkinson the chance to run down the right and deliver a low cross for the substitute David Kelly to sweep home from close range. That only served to intensify the action as Fulham threw everything forward in search of an equaliser. And as they continued to press forward, Tranmere's defending became increasingly desperate. But in the end, it was too little, too late for Fulham and Tranmere go marching on.",

      "body": "<p>The plastic pitch is ready for a comeback with Fifa set to give its blessing to a return to synthetic turf to improve the quality of playing surfaces. </p> <p>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has told The Observer that artificial pitches could solve the problem of overuse by top European teams - including clubs such as Manchester United in the Premier League - as the playing calendar becomes evermore congested and new stadia developments render natural turf unplayable. </p> <p>The Observer can reveal that several Premiership sides - Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Manchester United among them - are already training on the pitches in the expectation that they will soon be playing on them in League and Cup. </p> <p>Plastic pitches introduced in to Britain during the 1980s in the wake of their apparently successful use at stadiums in the ill-starred North American Soccer League. Four Football League sides - Queens Park Rangers, Luton Town, Preston North End and Oldham Athletic - laid the pitches but they were later torn up after serious concerns were voiced about the condition of the carpets. A report by the old Sports Council claimed training and playing on the surfaces left large numbers of footballers suffering friction burns and serious joint damage. </p> <p>Fifa changed its rules to outlaw the plastic carpets. But now it appears that a reversal is on the cards because of the vastly improved technology and the need to cope with an expanding playing programme. </p> <p>Speaking during the African Nations Cup in Ghana, Blatter admitted that there were now no formal objections to artificial pitches being used - even at the very highest level of the game. 'As football grows, there will become less pitches available in certain countries which do not permit play every day,' he said. </p> <p>'With artificial surfaces you can play as often as you like. We have removed any objections to artificial pitches from our statutes, and that includes the World Cup. There would be absolutely no problem with a top league in Europe using modern technology to provide artificial pitches.'</p> <p>That would give the green light to the Premier League to look at 'plastic' again. And only last week, Fifa agreed to foot the bill for installing a plastic pitch at Liberia's national stadium in the country's capital, Monrovia. It will be used for international matches, just as Norway play their home games at Oslo's Ulleval Stadium on a pitch which is part traditional turf and part artificial. </p> <p>A Fifa spokesman this week admitted that the re-introduction could come sooner rather than later.

      "bodyText": "The plastic pitch is ready for a comeback with Fifa set to give its blessing to a return to synthetic turf to improve the quality of playing surfaces. Fifa president Sepp Blatter has told The Observer that artificial pitches could solve the problem of overuse by top European teams - including clubs such as Manchester United in the Premier League - as the playing calendar becomes evermore congested and new stadia developments render natural turf unplayable. The Observer can reveal that several Premiership sides - Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Manchester United among them - are already training on the pitches in the expectation that they will soon be playing on them in League and Cup. Plastic pitches introduced in to Britain during the 1980s in the wake of their apparently successful use at stadiums in the ill-starred North American Soccer League. Four Football League sides - Queens Park Rangers, Luton Town, Preston North End and Oldham Athletic - laid the pitches but they were later torn up after serious concerns were voiced about the condition of the carpets. A report by the old Sports Council claimed training and playing on the surfaces left large numbers of footballers suffering friction burns and serious joint damage. Fifa changed its rules to outlaw the plastic carpets. But now it appears that a reversal is on the cards because of the vastly improved technology and the need to cope with an expanding playing programme. Speaking during the African Nations Cup in Ghana, Blatter admitted that there were now no formal objections to artificial pitches being used - even at the very highest level of the game. 'As football grows, there will become less pitches available in certain countries which do not permit play every day,' he said. 'With artificial surfaces you can play as often as you like. We have removed any objections to artificial pitches from our statutes, and that includes the World Cup. There would be absolutely no problem with a top league in Europe using modern technology to provide artificial pitches.' That would give the green light to the Premier League to look at 'plastic' again. And only last week, Fifa agreed to foot the bill for installing a plastic pitch at Liberia's national stadium in the country's capital, Monrovia. It will be used for international matches, just as Norway play their home games at Oslo's Ulleval Stadium on a pitch which is part traditional turf and part artificial. A Fifa spokesman this week admitted that the re-introduction could come sooner rather than later. He said: 'The decision rests not just with ourselves but with organisers of the major Cup competitions. Certainly, we do not believe that there is any reason why they should not give these new technologies their blessing.' Jeff Perris, from the Sports Turf Research Institute in Bingley, West Yorkshire says the new generation of artificial surfaces are so good that they are virtually indistinguishable from grass. 'We have been contracted by several companies manufacturing the pitches to test them out and the results have been astonishing. 'They have to meet various criteria to satisfy the footballing authorities, including how the ball bounces, the give in the surface and also the grip the players get. 'One reason that the old pitches went out of favour was that they performed so badly under the tests, but these pitches have more or less the same qualities as grass.' The new artificial surfaces are made by companies in Canada, the United States and Holland. One system used by the Norwegian FA knits together natural grass and artificial fibres to create a carpet more able to withstand the football's rigours. Another design works almost like a vacuum cleaner combining an artificial top layer with a series of pipes under the surface which can suck excess water from the surface of the pitch and also be used to blow warm air through the fibres to overcome frost. A number of Premiership clubs have already installed pitches at their training grounds at a cost of \u00a3200,000 a piece.

Only the crimes change. Hunter himself has dismissed the police procedural tag for sounding too mechanical and too bureaucratic; for making it sound as if the books are too much about the nuts and bolts of crime. His subject is not the police, he has said, but the imagined city they patrol. His fans agree. 'He has challenged us to think about the precarious value of human life in a huge American city,' wrote Pete Hamill, another hard man of American letters, in a recent New Yorker profile. 'A place populated by blind beggars, youth gangs, predatory rapists, con men, blackmailers, race hustlers, kidnappers, burglars and stool pigeons.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is one sense in which the term 'procedural' applies: just as the list of his past work shows industry and commitment, so does his use of language. This, it seems, is how you go about the business - the trade, perhaps - of writing. Each word has a job to do. They describe things. They put their shoulder to the narrative and push. They give characters things to say and things to do. And when they're done the used words make way for others that are fresh.

Newcomers catch up as best they may. But McBain is a good enough writer to know that each book must stand alone and so it does.</p> <p>Fans of American cop shows like NYPD Blue or Homicide will find the fractured narrative familiar, the unwieldy job of hero foist not upon the shoulders of one character but on a whole squad, from the dogged, street-smart lapsed-Catholic Steve Carella, through the intense Jewish Meyer Meyer to Artie Brown, the only black man, and Oliver Wendell Weeks, the only overt racist.</p> <p>Plot lines cut in and out of each other. Small details, at the edge of a paragraph, turn into vital pieces of evidence. Resolution comes not in a sudden burst like a clap of thunder, but in the piling up of moment upon moment. </p> <p>The story in the fiftieth instalment, for what it's worth, (which isn't much in the great scheme of things) involves a death by natural causes that can't have been, a gangland hit in a pizza restaurant and a big showbiz opening, maybe in that order. But, as Hunter said, the theme is less the killings than the city in which they happen: there is much here on the strained race relations of a great metropolis, even though questions of colour are not vital to the final reckoning of who did what to whom. Still it is there, as indeed it should be in an America which is more obsessed with the race issue than almost any other.</p> <p>There's also a lot about drugs, most particularly Rohypnol, the so-called 'date rape' drug, which has had a secure lease on the down-page headlines in recent years. Without reading any of the others it is impossible to know, but one imagines that trends, fashions and social phenomena like this find their way into the pages of each 87th Precinct book, as McBain gives himself to the job of chronicler. In less skilled hands it could seem forced or unwelcome. McBain is better than that. </p> <p>And yet he does have his weaknesses, most obviously when he steps off home turf. A storyline out of London introduces a number of British characters who are grossly stereotyped and clumsily drawn. Did the British honorary consul really have to sport a 'bristly moustache that made him look like a cavalry colonel'?</p> <p>Likewise, a plot point turns on another character describing himself as being from 'Euston, London'. Does anybody ever describe themselves as being from Euston? Or from anywhere particular in London for that matter? But this is hardly a revelation. Ed McBain/ Evan Hunter writes best about what he knows which is the life - and death - of a city. He understands its rhythms. He knows what makes it tick. And he's been doing it so long now, it could hardly be otherwise.</p>",

Still it is there, as indeed it should be in an America which is more obsessed with the race issue than almost any other. There's also a lot about drugs, most particularly Rohypnol, the so-called 'date rape' drug, which has had a secure lease on the down-page headlines in recent years. Without reading any of the others it is impossible to know, but one imagines that trends, fashions and social phenomena like this find their way into the pages of each 87th Precinct book, as McBain gives himself to the job of chronicler. In less skilled hands it could seem forced or unwelcome. McBain is better than that. And yet he does have his weaknesses, most obviously when he steps off home turf. A storyline out of London introduces a number of British characters who are grossly stereotyped and clumsily drawn. Did the British honorary consul really have to sport a 'bristly moustache that made him look like a cavalry colonel'? Likewise, a plot point turns on another character describing himself as being from 'Euston, London'. Does anybody ever describe themselves as being from Euston? Or from anywhere particular in London for that matter? But this is hardly a revelation. Ed McBain/ Evan Hunter writes best about what he knows which is the life - and death - of a city. He understands its rhythms. He knows what makes it tick. And he's been doing it so long now, it could hardly be otherwise.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Jorge Luis Borges - The Total Library: Non-fiction 1922-86</strong></p> <p>edited by Eliot Weinberger, translated by Esther Allen, Suzanne Jill Levine and Eliot Weinberger</p> <p>Allen Lane \u00a320, pp560</p> <p> Borges's work has undergone an uneasy passage into English. With few exceptions, he has been carelessly translated and haphazardly published, so that the English-speaking reader has only been able to recognise his genius through a glass, darkly. Based on the evidence of this new volume, there doesn't seem to be much hope of reading Borges as he should be read, face to face, any time soon.</p> <p>Under the title The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922-1986 Penguin has released the third volume of its Collected Borges. Edited by Professor Eliot Weinberger, it offers yet another dismembered section of the body of work of one of the essential writers of the twentieth century.</p> <p>Throughout his almost centenary life, Borges strove to write from the point of view of the reader for whom the academic divisions into fiction, non-fiction and poetry (set down for the guidance of the faithful by Wolfgang Kayser in 1948) are merely prejudices or conventions. He used these terminological assumptions to tell essays to the tune of 'once upon a time', to disguise stories as reviews or essays and to compose poems that were essay-like explorations or stories in sonnet form.</p> <p>To what genre do texts such as 'The Wall and the Books', 'Borges and I', 'Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote', 'Ars Poetica' belong? Who would dare classify the following extraordinary lines as fiction, non-fiction or poetry? </p> <p>'Time is the substance of which I am made. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that tears me apart, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.' </p> <p>Professor Weinberger has dared. He has dauntlessly rushed in where angels fear to tread and, professorial credentials in hand, decided that these lines (the ending of 'A New Refutation of Time') are non-fiction and proper for the literary folk of England.</p> <p>In his introduction, Professor Weinberger explains with refreshing candour: 'It should also be said that this book has been edited for the English-speaking reader. The result is that a large portion of Borges's writing has been neglected here: hundreds of articles he wrote on Argentine literature and culture... These articles would have required a rich subsoil of footnotes to produce a meagre interest.'</p> <p>Having thus decided that the English-speaking reader's interest is limited to English culture (with a few generous allowances that include the Greeks and a handful of continentals), Professor Weinberger then reorganises what he considers to be Borges's non-fiction into a convenient chronological order. Mocking the French decision to publish, in the exquisitely edited Pl\u00e9iade edition, Borges's writings according to the magazines and papers in which they appeared, Professor Weinberger proceeds to pick and choose his way through the vast oeuvre.</p> <p>He decides to group, for instance, several short occasional pieces Borges wrote on the Third Reich during the war and to select a random handful of book reviews and short literary biographies that were Borges's bread-and-butter in the Thirties and Forties.</p> <p>Professor Weinberger's exclusions are equally arbitrary: he leaves out (for no clear reason) the superb speech Borges gave against dictatorships in 1942 and (probably because of its Argentine subject) the essential essay on the death of Leopoldo Lugones that closes his 1965 book on the poet.</p> <p>A cursory lecture on Shakespeare delivered in 1964 and a very minor text introducing a 1962 exhibition of Spanish books are published for the first time; in spite of their slightness, they are nevertheless to be welcomed.

      "bodyText": "Jorge Luis Borges - The Total Library: Non-fiction 1922-86 edited by Eliot Weinberger, translated by Esther Allen, Suzanne Jill Levine and Eliot Weinberger Allen Lane \u00a320, pp560 Borges's work has undergone an uneasy passage into English. With few exceptions, he has been carelessly translated and haphazardly published, so that the English-speaking reader has only been able to recognise his genius through a glass, darkly. Based on the evidence of this new volume, there doesn't seem to be much hope of reading Borges as he should be read, face to face, any time soon. Under the title The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922-1986 Penguin has released the third volume of its Collected Borges. Edited by Professor Eliot Weinberger, it offers yet another dismembered section of the body of work of one of the essential writers of the twentieth century. Throughout his almost centenary life, Borges strove to write from the point of view of the reader for whom the academic divisions into fiction, non-fiction and poetry (set down for the guidance of the faithful by Wolfgang Kayser in 1948) are merely prejudices or conventions. He used these terminological assumptions to tell essays to the tune of 'once upon a time', to disguise stories as reviews or essays and to compose poems that were essay-like explorations or stories in sonnet form. To what genre do texts such as 'The Wall and the Books', 'Borges and I', 'Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote', 'Ars Poetica' belong? Who would dare classify the following extraordinary lines as fiction, non-fiction or poetry? 'Time is the substance of which I am made. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that tears me apart, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.' Professor Weinberger has dared. He has dauntlessly rushed in where angels fear to tread and, professorial credentials in hand, decided that these lines (the ending of 'A New Refutation of Time') are non-fiction and proper for the literary folk of England. In his introduction, Professor Weinberger explains with refreshing candour: 'It should also be said that this book has been edited for the English-speaking reader. The result is that a large portion of Borges's writing has been neglected here: hundreds of articles he wrote on Argentine literature and culture... These articles would have required a rich subsoil of footnotes to produce a meagre interest.' Having thus decided that the English-speaking reader's interest is limited to English culture (with a few generous allowances that include the Greeks and a handful of continentals), Professor Weinberger then reorganises what he considers to be Borges's non-fiction into a convenient chronological order. Mocking the French decision to publish, in the exquisitely edited Pl\u00e9iade edition, Borges's writings according to the magazines and papers in which they appeared, Professor Weinberger proceeds to pick and choose his way through the vast oeuvre. He decides to group, for instance, several short occasional pieces Borges wrote on the Third Reich during the war and to select a random handful of book reviews and short literary biographies that were Borges's bread-and-butter in the Thirties and Forties. Professor Weinberger's exclusions are equally arbitrary: he leaves out (for no clear reason) the superb speech Borges gave against dictatorships in 1942 and (probably because of its Argentine subject) the essential essay on the death of Leopoldo Lugones that closes his 1965 book on the poet. A cursory lecture on Shakespeare delivered in 1964 and a very minor text introducing a 1962 exhibition of Spanish books are published for the first time; in spite of their slightness, they are nevertheless to be welcomed. More importantly, Borges's fundamental book on Dante makes here its first appearance in English. Dante's Commedia was one of Borges's key books: he read it in the early Forties in Dent's bilingual Italian-English three-volume edition on the tram that led him every day to his miserable job as municipal assistant librarian. 'I began Hell in English,' he confessed. 'By the time I reached Paradise I could follow Dante in Italian.' The earliest mention of Dante in Borges's work is from 1932; in 1983 he decided to collect several of these pieces under the title Nueve Esayos Dantesco, though it carries a slight whiff of fire and brimstone, clearly has Dante as its subject. In English, the word conjures up less the author of the Commedia than an eschatological extravagance. Professor Weinberger has concealed the credentials of his two co-translators. Suzanne Jill Levine is well-known for her excellent renditions of Manuel Puig, Severo Sarduy and Bioy Casares; Esther Allen, who signs the translation of Nine Dantesque Essays, is unknown to me and, on the basis of her version of Borges's book, will probably remain so. The grating English title should not, however, dissuade the reader from discovering these texts. They are fundamental both as a key to Borges's thought and to an understanding of literature in general, not only Dante's. In 30 perfect pages, Borges explains, convincingly, how literature can construct credible realities that translate our reality for us: with elegant simplicity, he addresses (and suggests answers for) the impossible questions regarding the creative impulse, art's ambiguous truth, the artist's understanding and compassion, literary tradition and collaboration across the ages, the transcendence of language and, finally and movingly, how love can cause a poet to build an everlasting monument for the sake of an imagined or wishful encounter. Whoever has not yet read these essays, has a wealth of wonders in store. A single example must suffice. Confronted with the problem of whether Count Ugolino did or did not devour his children in the dreadful tower to which Dante confines him in the fourth canto of the Inferno, Borges concludes: 'In real time, in history, whenever a man is confronted with several alternatives, he chooses one and eliminates and loses the others. Such is not the case in the ambiguous time of art, which is similar to that of hope and oblivion. In that time, Hamlet is sane and is mad. In the darkness of his Tower of Hunger, Ugolino devours and does not devour his beloved corpses, and this undulating imprecision, this uncertainty, is the strange matter of which he is made. Thus, with two possible deaths, did Dante dream him, and thus will the generations dream him.' Who, other than Borges, could reveal to us this seminal literary truth, a truth every reader recognises but which had never before been put into words?",

On his wrists are the grooves left by the constant use of ratchet handcuffs, employed during the 59 transfers between penal institutions he has had to endure. These are merely the physical marks left by more than a decade inside the prison system; years he has served for a conviction which he and a growing band of supporters say is a gross - and racist - miscarriage of justice. The emotional scars doubtless run much deeper.</p> <p>Ram's name may not be as familiar as that of Stephen Lawrence or Michael Menson, but to many who have followed his story it is every bit as symptomatic of an embedded racism within the criminal justice system as those more infamous cases.</p> <p>Ram was convicted 13 years ago of a killing which he has always said was an act of self-defence against a racist attack - but which the court ruled was a straightforward case of murder. Since the conviction he has been shifted around the prison system on average once every three months and has spent a total of four years in solitary confinement - simply, he says, for proclaiming his innocence and refusing to submit to inhumane treatment.</p> <p>'Racism is endemic within the prison system,' he told me when we met at Full Sutton maximum security prison outside York last week. 'Life for me revolves around trying to get through every day without becoming a statistic of another death in custody.'</p> <p>He has never before been allowed to tell his side of the story. At his trial his barrister, who had misread a pathologist's report, told him a plea of self-defence was unsustainable and advised him not to give evidence. The judge at his failed appeal in 1995 also refused him the chance to speak. It has been left to pop groups like Primal Scream and the Asian Dub Foundation, to high-profile writers and comedians like Irvine Welsh and Sean Hughes, and to a welter of MPs to put his case for him. Earlier this month an early day motion calling for Ram's release was tabled in the House of Commons.</p> <p>The Home Office would have preferred Ram to stay silent. Until recently journalists were not allowed to interview prisoners serving life sentences for murder, regardless of any claims of wrongful conviction. But last July the House of Lords ruled the policy unlawful. Accordingly this is the first time Satpal Ram has been free to speak. 'I'm finally able to give evidence on my own behalf,' he says.</p> <p>The facts of the case are deeply disturbing. Satpal was born and bred in Birmingham, where his parents settled from northern India in the early 1960s.</p> <p>In November 1986, then 20, he and two friends went for a meal at the Sky Blue Indian restaurant in the Lozells area of the city. A table of six white people also in the restaurant started hurling racist abuse at the waiters and complaining about the Asian music that was being played. Satpal responded with a call for the music to be turned up. One of the men, Stuart Pearce, then came at Satpal with a broken glass and stabbed him in the face. Satpal responded by drawing a short-bladed penknife. In the ensuing struggle, Pearce sustained a number of stab wounds and later died.</p> <p>Satpal, now 34, says that in the racially divided Birmingham of the Eighties, where attacks on Asians were commonplace, his response was understandable. He himself had been assaulted a number of times prior to the incident at the Blue Sky. 'I've never refuted that a man died as a result of my actions,' he says. 'But the circumstances have never been taken into consideration. I accept that loss of life is wrong, but if I hadn't done what I did I would be dead now.' A week after the killing he turned himself into the police.</p> <p>Prior to his trial Satpal had only one 40-minute consultation with his barrister, the late Douglas Draycott QC, who informed him that because of the number of stab wounds Pearce had sustained a plea of self-defence - which is an absolute defence - was destined to fail. This was based upon a misreading of a pathologist's report. It did list six wounds, but said that only two of them were the result of the blade. The rest were superficial and caused when Pearce fell on to broken glass.</p> <p>At the trial, a whole series of Asian witnesses, who could have supported Satpal's version of events, were never called. The evidence of the one who did take the stand was dismissed because his broken English could not readily be understood. No translator was employed. At one point the judge told the jury he would translate, even though he did not speak Bengali.</p> <p>'I put my faith in my lawyers,' Satpal says. 'They assured me they'd do everything they could but the trial was a complete farce. To be honest I didn't know what was happening. I'd spent eight months on remand in inhumane conditions.'</p> <p>Immediately after his conviction Draycott informed Satpal - wrongly - that there were no grounds for appeal. He was left to draft an application himself, which he did, citing the failure to employ interpreters. He did eventually manage to get two appeal hearings, the last in 1995. Both times the judges ruled that failings on the part of defence counsel were not good grounds upon which to quash a conviction.</p> <p>It would be bad enough if the issues raised around Satpal's case began and ended with his wrongful conviction, but they do not. His subsequent treatment within the prison system gives grave cause for concern.</p> <p>'My troubles really started three years after my conviction when my family began a campaign to gain my release,' he says. He alleges he received a beating in Nottingham prison at the hands of prison officers, though no charges have been brought. Another allegation of physical assault while at Frankland Prison in Durham last year is now under police investigation.</p> <p>He has been thrown repeatedly into solitary confinement, often stripped naked. He describes an incident - also at Frankland Prison - where, after a routine search, six prisoners were forced to strip naked and squat for anal searches. Satpal was not one of those involved but he was outraged at the way fellow inmates were being treated. 'This to me was a sexual assault,' he says. 'I made a telephone call to the Prisoners' Advice Service and requested them to provide legal intervention. The call was monitored and the next thing I know I am accused of incitement and taken to the segregation unit.' Many of the attacks and much of the intimidation he has endured have come, he says, garnished with racial abuse.</p> <p>Satpal is a fiercely articulate man who has been politicised by his experiences. He has educated himself about his rights in prison and refuses now simply to accept the rulings of authority. 'If I feel I'm being maltreated or denied my rights, I'll say so. I don't get gratification from causing problems.'</p> <p>He recognises that this is at the root of his problems. For a period he was on the Continuous Assessment Scheme, under which he was transferred from prison to prison, often in a restraining body belt, every 28 days. 'It's designed to isolate you as much as possible from your family,' he says. But this has not dissuaded him from complaining. 'I've gone past caring what they think of me. There's people in this prison, where I've been seven times, who have been responsible for torturing me and now they're all smiles as if nothing ever happened. If there's any kickback from speaking out in this article, I'll deal with it when it happens.'</p> <p>The prison service refuses to comment on individual cases, so it is impossible to verify any of Satpal's allegations. However, the last time he came up before the parole board in 1997 it recognised that he had been transferred far too many times.</p> <p>The tariff placed on him at sentencing - the minimum period he has to serve - was put at 10 years, which he has now completed. To be eligible for parole, prisoners must undertake offending behaviour courses on things like anger management and strategic thinking, but there are always long waiting lists. A prisoner moving every single month has no chance of getting a place. Despite the recommendation of the parole board he has been transferred a further nine times since it was made.</p> <p>Satpal has been at Full Sutton this time round for five months. His treatment has been better: 'It's only because of the intervention of the media and groups like Amnesty International and Asian Dub Foundation that the situation has improved. I've got a very good support group outside. They'll visit me wherever I am and if they don't hear from me by phone they get concerned,' he says.</p> <p>There's also a new set of legal initiatives under way. His case has been taken on by Gareth Pierce, the solicitor who helped to overturn the wrongful convictions of Judith Ward, the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. 'This is a forgotten case,' she says. 'It is a litany of mistakes, of things not done, of evidence not pursued. Most of it has been touched upon and then shrugged off by different courts.' She is now preparing a submission for the Criminal Cases Review Commission which will focus on the social context in which the original incident occurred.</p> <p>'Here's a young Asian man growing up in an urban environment where active racist attacks were ongoing,' she says. 'It wasn't exactly kill or be killed but it was defend or be dead.' Home Office Minister Paul Boateng has agreed to a meeting next month with Satpal's supporters to discuss the case. Last weekend Boateng was elected a vice-president of the Civil Rights Movement, founded last year out of the Stephen Lawrence campaign.</p> <p>These are promising developments, but Satpal won't speculate on what he'll do when he's released. He's been inside too long for those kinds of painful dreams.</p> <p>Instead he keeps busy, reading a lot - books by Gandhi and Mandela, Martin Luther King and George Jackson of the Black Panthers - and doing courses on calligraphy and design.</p> <p>But, he says, 'I'm optimistic that something's going to happen, not that I have any faith in the appeal process. It's just things are moving.' He knows better than to hope for quick results. He's been inside for 13 years.</p> <p>For Satpal Ram, the Asian man from Birmingham who pulled a knife in self-defence, time only ever moves slowly.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Goethe: The Poet and the Age (Volume II): Revolution and Renunciation 1790-1803 </strong><br>Nicholas Boyle</p> <p>Oxford University Press \u00a330, pp949</p> <p>Nicholas Boyle's Goethe: The Poet and the Age towers among a Victorian prodigality of massive biographies: Lord Bullock's double portraits of Hitler and Stalin, Richard Holmes's Coleridge, David Cairns's Berlioz, Michael Holroyd's Shaw, Richardson's Picasso. Some 2,000 pages and two volumes into the journey, and we have reached only 1803.</p> <p>As in no other individual existence - what do we know of Plato, of Leonardo or of Shakespeare? - the sheer range of Goethe's sovereignty fully justifies, indeed compels Boyle's amplitude. A complete edition of the works and correspondence, of the drawings and state papers, might exceed 100 volumes. These would include lyric and epic verse, drama, prose fiction, literary criticism, translations (from 28 languages), diaries, many of pre-eminent stature and influence. They would include texts, some book-length, on optics, mineralogy, comparative botany, reflections on architecture, the incomparable conversations with Eckermann.</p> <p>Often Goethe dictated in a week what would constitute very nearly the collected writings of lesser spirits. He did so while travelling, while helping to govern a duchy, while directing its theatre and opera, investigating its agricultural and mineral resources, accompanying its ruler to war, begetting a family and entering on erotic relationships almost each of which generated poetry of a classic force.</p> <p>Rightly, Napoleon hailed in Goethe the boundless measure of man; to innumerable contemporaries, the author of Werther and of Faust, Newton's opponent in the theory of the spectrum, the begetter of a pre-Darwinian morphology of species, seemed of a stature more than human. In complex ways, not immune to irony and recurrent depression, Goethe was prepared to share this estimate. </p> <p>Nicholas Boyle's second instalment covers a period of tumultuous public and private experience. In a perspective at once traditional and authoritative, Boyle retells the history of the French Revolution and of the rise of Bonaparte. In parallel, he summarises admirably the idealist revolution and counter-revolution in German philosophic thought.</p> <p>One could extract from Goethe II a handy introduction to Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Jacobi and surrounding luminaries. Goethe and his works were intimately related to these tidal motions. He was present at the battle of Valmy and may, on the spot, have recognised in that event a change in the very order of the European world. French armies were to force him and his family into vexing peregrinations.</p> <p>Boyle's treatment of Goethe's readings and uses of Kant would make for a tidy monograph in itself. As would Boyle's analysis of Goethe's studies and experiments in optics, in the meaning and structure of light. The conclusions drawn were erroneous, but it has been argued that the treatise on colours, the Farbenlehre, is a stylistic, intellectual masterpiece at the heart of Goethe's achievements. An achievement relating Goethe to Spinoza on the one hand, and to various schools of light-mysticism, of 'illuminism' in a literal vein, both Western and Oriental (Persian doctrines and literature fascinated Goethe).</p> <p>But Boyle is also a literary expositor and critic of vivacious perspicacity. His treatment of Wilhelm Meister, Goethe's didactic roman-fleuve, of the domestic epic, Hermann und Dorothea, of that enigmatic yet somehow pivotal drama, The Natural Daughter, of individual lyrics and of the gestation of Faust, already 25 years in the making and legendary prior to its publication, could be combined into a most useful guide to realms largely unknown to English literacy. In appendix, one would find Boyle's analyses of Schiller's aesthetics, dramas, historical narratives.</p> <p>The Goethe-Schiller nexus, beginning in July 1794, the collaborative rivalry and loving tension between the two men in Jena and Weimar, is like no other known to literature or art. No single thread can do justice to the intricacies of Goethe's inner evolution during these seminal years. But Boyle does trace the change in Goethe from an earlier Romantic radicalism, from a Promethean rebelliousness, to that Olympian conservatism which was to become his hallmark. A deep sense of domesticity, of familial pleasures, of emotional balance took over in 1793 and 1794 from the Sturm und Drang of an earlier sensibility.</p> <p>Having witnessed the face of the mob, having followed closely the development of the Terror in France, more and more alert to the fragile social fabric which empowered the flowering of knowledge and the arts, Goethe made his celebrated (yet still problematic) choice: where need be, injustice must be preferred to disorder. This conservatism of a man now 'bulky and in his forties' was subtly undermined by the paganism, by the scientific audacities of Goethe's passions. It never achieved the lapidary repose manifest in Burke.</p> <p>At numerous points, moreover, as Boyle admirably shows, a wealth of private, even esoteric significance underlies the high polish, the classical forms of Goethe's works. These covert depths were to find expression, itself often mysterious, in the hybrid immensities of Faust II.</p> <p>Nicholas Boyle stands beside Carlyle, Emerson and Auden in the select galaxy of those who have striven to make Goethe part of the English-language inheritance. Yet a disturbing paradox underlies this entire enterprise. These volumes could not have been written in postwar Germany. Not after the philosopher Karl Jaspers's influential dissent from Goethe-idolatry in 1948.</p> <p>Boyle seems indifferent to the courtly officiousness in Goethe's treatment of Fichte's radicalism and academic employment; there is nothing, so far, to clarify Goethe and Schiller's derision of the ailing Holderlin (the greater poet); the voluminous exposition of Wilhelm Meister leaves unanswered the question of why that opus is today virtually unreadable and unread. But the issue is a larger one: how was it that a commitment to Goethe, at every level of schooling and cultural activities, proved irrelevant in the face of political barbarism? What terrible truth lies behind the fact that Goethe's Weimar abuts on the camp at Buchenwald?</p> <p>It may be that Dr Boyle will confront these questions in the closing part of his great labour. They should not be evaded. In Germany, they are not.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Goethe: The Poet and the Age (Volume II): Revolution and Renunciation 1790-1803 Nicholas Boyle Oxford University Press \u00a330, pp949 Nicholas Boyle's Goethe: The Poet and the Age towers among a Victorian prodigality of massive biographies: Lord Bullock's double portraits of Hitler and Stalin, Richard Holmes's Coleridge, David Cairns's Berlioz, Michael Holroyd's Shaw, Richardson's Picasso. Some 2,000 pages and two volumes into the journey, and we have reached only 1803. As in no other individual existence - what do we know of Plato, of Leonardo or of Shakespeare? - the sheer range of Goethe's sovereignty fully justifies, indeed compels Boyle's amplitude. A complete edition of the works and correspondence, of the drawings and state papers, might exceed 100 volumes. These would include lyric and epic verse, drama, prose fiction, literary criticism, translations (from 28 languages), diaries, many of pre-eminent stature and influence. They would include texts, some book-length, on optics, mineralogy, comparative botany, reflections on architecture, the incomparable conversations with Eckermann. Often Goethe dictated in a week what would constitute very nearly the collected writings of lesser spirits. He did so while travelling, while helping to govern a duchy, while directing its theatre and opera, investigating its agricultural and mineral resources, accompanying its ruler to war, begetting a family and entering on erotic relationships almost each of which generated poetry of a classic force. Rightly, Napoleon hailed in Goethe the boundless measure of man; to innumerable contemporaries, the author of Werther and of Faust, Newton's opponent in the theory of the spectrum, the begetter of a pre-Darwinian morphology of species, seemed of a stature more than human. In complex ways, not immune to irony and recurrent depression, Goethe was prepared to share this estimate. Nicholas Boyle's second instalment covers a period of tumultuous public and private experience. In a perspective at once traditional and authoritative, Boyle retells the history of the French Revolution and of the rise of Bonaparte. In parallel, he summarises admirably the idealist revolution and counter-revolution in German philosophic thought. One could extract from Goethe II a handy introduction to Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Jacobi and surrounding luminaries. Goethe and his works were intimately related to these tidal motions. He was present at the battle of Valmy and may, on the spot, have recognised in that event a change in the very order of the European world. French armies were to force him and his family into vexing peregrinations. Boyle's treatment of Goethe's readings and uses of Kant would make for a tidy monograph in itself. As would Boyle's analysis of Goethe's studies and experiments in optics, in the meaning and structure of light. The conclusions drawn were erroneous, but it has been argued that the treatise on colours, the Farbenlehre, is a stylistic, intellectual masterpiece at the heart of Goethe's achievements. An achievement relating Goethe to Spinoza on the one hand, and to various schools of light-mysticism, of 'illuminism' in a literal vein, both Western and Oriental (Persian doctrines and literature fascinated Goethe). But Boyle is also a literary expositor and critic of vivacious perspicacity. His treatment of Wilhelm Meister, Goethe's didactic roman-fleuve, of the domestic epic, Hermann und Dorothea, of that enigmatic yet somehow pivotal drama, The Natural Daughter, of individual lyrics and of the gestation of Faust, already 25 years in the making and legendary prior to its publication, could be combined into a most useful guide to realms largely unknown to English literacy. In appendix, one would find Boyle's analyses of Schiller's aesthetics, dramas, historical narratives. The Goethe-Schiller nexus, beginning in July 1794, the collaborative rivalry and loving tension between the two men in Jena and Weimar, is like no other known to literature or art. No single thread can do justice to the intricacies of Goethe's inner evolution during these seminal years. But Boyle does trace the change in Goethe from an earlier Romantic radicalism, from a Promethean rebelliousness, to that Olympian conservatism which was to become his hallmark. A deep sense of domesticity, of familial pleasures, of emotional balance took over in 1793 and 1794 from the Sturm und Drang of an earlier sensibility. Having witnessed the face of the mob, having followed closely the development of the Terror in France, more and more alert to the fragile social fabric which empowered the flowering of knowledge and the arts, Goethe made his celebrated (yet still problematic) choice: where need be, injustice must be preferred to disorder. This conservatism of a man now 'bulky and in his forties' was subtly undermined by the paganism, by the scientific audacities of Goethe's passions. It never achieved the lapidary repose manifest in Burke. At numerous points, moreover, as Boyle admirably shows, a wealth of private, even esoteric significance underlies the high polish, the classical forms of Goethe's works. These covert depths were to find expression, itself often mysterious, in the hybrid immensities of Faust II. Nicholas Boyle stands beside Carlyle, Emerson and Auden in the select galaxy of those who have striven to make Goethe part of the English-language inheritance. Yet a disturbing paradox underlies this entire enterprise. These volumes could not have been written in postwar Germany. Not after the philosopher Karl Jaspers's influential dissent from Goethe-idolatry in 1948. Boyle seems indifferent to the courtly officiousness in Goethe's treatment of Fichte's radicalism and academic employment; there is nothing, so far, to clarify Goethe and Schiller's derision of the ailing Holderlin (the greater poet); the voluminous exposition of Wilhelm Meister leaves unanswered the question of why that opus is today virtually unreadable and unread. But the issue is a larger one: how was it that a commitment to Goethe, at every level of schooling and cultural activities, proved irrelevant in the face of political barbarism? What terrible truth lies behind the fact that Goethe's Weimar abuts on the camp at Buchenwald? It may be that Dr Boyle will confront these questions in the closing part of his great labour. They should not be evaded. In Germany, they are not.",

If the stories of Mr Schwab losing a third of his staff before this forum and perhaps another swathe afterwards are true, it might be as good a time as any to reassess and purify the central aims of the organisation. Attendees from previous years have remarked on the rising number of private Swiss bankers attending the conference with relatively little to contribute in the way of world debate. Indeed, we are guilty in our own way: the press sends more and more journalists, who have less and less of import to report. It's time for Davos Man to relocate - so stick that in your salopettes and take it down a black run.",

But NatWest now admits it was wrong to tell you that old accounts are no longer available. The debt recovery department was not closed; it moved to Telford, in Shropshire. </p> <p>The bank is recalling your file and sending you the information you asked for. </p> <p><strong> NHS pension: Filling the gap</strong><br> </p> <p> I have worked part-time as a GP practice nurse since 1980. Like all practice nurses, I was not permitted to join the NHS pension scheme until September 1997, but have been contributing since then. I read recently that the European Court of Justice has ruled that part-time workers are entitled to backdated pension rights. If this ruling is upheld, what effect will it have on pensions for practice nurses? </p> <p>Will it be possible for me and my colleagues to buy back missed years, and what should I do, given that I shall probably be retiring before this is settled?<br><strong>MJ, Caldy</strong></p> <p>The ruling is expected imminently on the challenge to the UK government allowing part-timers to backdate for only two years. </p> <p>However you were originally excluded from the NHS scheme not because you worked part-time but because all practice nurses, including full-timers, were excluded. So this part-time ruling is not relevant to your situation. You could claim discrimination only if, before you were able to join the NHS scheme, your practice had offered the British Medical Association pension to its full-time nurses and excluded part-timers. </p> <p>Buying 'added years' is different from being allowed to backdate your pension for longer than originally allowed. You can buy added years but, so close to retirement, this is unlikely to be worth doing. Ask the NHS Pensions Agency about this. </p> <p><strong> Lawyer's delay: My \u00a335 bill</strong><br> </p> <p>Earlier this year, I took out a further loan on my house with Abbey National, using a local solicitor. After a series of delays, Abbey released the money on 26 August. This was the date on which I started to pay interest on the loan. My solicitor did not release the money to me until 3 September, by which time I had paid \u00a337.22 interest without having the benefit of the money. </p> <p>The solicitor claims he did not receive it until 2 September, and sent me a derisory cheque for \u00a31.68 to cover overnight interest. </p> <p>I am confused as to where this money was between 26 August and 2 September. The one place I know it was not is in my account, so why should I be paying interest? <br><strong>KT, London</strong> </p> <p>Abbey National confirms that your solicitor banked the cheque on Friday 27 August. He obviously waited until it cleared before releasing the money to you. </p> <p>He can have no reason for suspecting that Abbey's cheque might bounce, so he could have released your money when he got it. In any case, he should have confirmed the completion date with you and warned that the delay would be longer than usual because it involved a bank holiday weekend. </p> <p>Using a solicitor was unavoidable because you were transferring equity with this loan. </p> <p>Ask him again why he waited for the Abbey's cheque to clear and why he did not advise you of the consequences. </p> <p> Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

NHS pension: Filling the gap I have worked part-time as a GP practice nurse since 1980. Like all practice nurses, I was not permitted to join the NHS pension scheme until September 1997, but have been contributing since then. I read recently that the European Court of Justice has ruled that part-time workers are entitled to backdated pension rights. If this ruling is upheld, what effect will it have on pensions for practice nurses? Will it be possible for me and my colleagues to buy back missed years, and what should I do, given that I shall probably be retiring before this is settled? MJ, Caldy The ruling is expected imminently on the challenge to the UK government allowing part-timers to backdate for only two years. However you were originally excluded from the NHS scheme not because you worked part-time but because all practice nurses, including full-timers, were excluded. So this part-time ruling is not relevant to your situation. You could claim discrimination only if, before you were able to join the NHS scheme, your practice had offered the British Medical Association pension to its full-time nurses and excluded part-timers. Buying 'added years' is different from being allowed to backdate your pension for longer than originally allowed. You can buy added years but, so close to retirement, this is unlikely to be worth doing. Ask the NHS Pensions Agency about this. Lawyer's delay: My \u00a335 bill Earlier this year, I took out a further loan on my house with Abbey National, using a local solicitor. After a series of delays, Abbey released the money on 26 August. This was the date on which I started to pay interest on the loan. My solicitor did not release the money to me until 3 September, by which time I had paid \u00a337.22 interest without having the benefit of the money. The solicitor claims he did not receive it until 2 September, and sent me a derisory cheque for \u00a31.68 to cover overnight interest. I am confused as to where this money was between 26 August and 2 September. The one place I know it was not is in my account, so why should I be paying interest? KT, London Abbey National confirms that your solicitor banked the cheque on Friday 27 August. He obviously waited until it cleared before releasing the money to you. He can have no reason for suspecting that Abbey's cheque might bounce, so he could have released your money when he got it. In any case, he should have confirmed the completion date with you and warned that the delay would be longer than usual because it involved a bank holiday weekend. Using a solicitor was unavoidable because you were transferring equity with this loan. Ask him again why he waited for the Abbey's cheque to clear and why he did not advise you of the consequences.

      "body": "<p>The music industry used to refer to music as 'product', implying something tangible, but the time is near when music will be called 'content' - intangible, and entirely apt for something that exists only as digital code on the Internet. </p> <p>In two quick steps, the two most risk-averse and bureaucratic of the big five music goliaths - Warner and EMI - have captured the high ground in dictating how a future Internet-based music business will look and work. They have also struck what may be a death blow to traditional music retailing and to the free-wheeling, copyright-lacking model of digital music distribution presented by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\" target=\"_new\">MP3.com</a>. </p> <p>Last week Richard Branson's Virgin chain acknowledged as much when it threatened to shut up shop unless record companies cut retailers in on the action. At the other end of the spectrum, MP3.com, the San Diego-based company that distributes music by largely unknown artists, was slapped with a copyright lawsuit from the Recording Industry Association of America that could shut it down if potential financial damages of $6.75 billion are awarded against it. </p> <p>What a digital music business will look like is still anyone's guess. An AOL-Time-Warner-EMI colossus appears to be leaning towards the 'pay-for-play' approach, under which consumers pay a subsciption and listen to music on demand. In theory, the EMI and Time-Warner catalogue (2 million songs from the Beatles to Missy Elliott) should ensure public acceptance of the music computer file as an alternative to the CD.

      "bodyText": "The music industry used to refer to music as 'product', implying something tangible, but the time is near when music will be called 'content' - intangible, and entirely apt for something that exists only as digital code on the Internet. In two quick steps, the two most risk-averse and bureaucratic of the big five music goliaths - Warner and EMI - have captured the high ground in dictating how a future Internet-based music business will look and work. They have also struck what may be a death blow to traditional music retailing and to the free-wheeling, copyright-lacking model of digital music distribution presented by the likes of MP3.com. Last week Richard Branson's Virgin chain acknowledged as much when it threatened to shut up shop unless record companies cut retailers in on the action. At the other end of the spectrum, MP3.com, the San Diego-based company that distributes music by largely unknown artists, was slapped with a copyright lawsuit from the Recording Industry Association of America that could shut it down if potential financial damages of $6.75 billion are awarded against it. What a digital music business will look like is still anyone's guess. An AOL-Time-Warner-EMI colossus appears to be leaning towards the 'pay-for-play' approach, under which consumers pay a subsciption and listen to music on demand. In theory, the EMI and Time-Warner catalogue (2 million songs from the Beatles to Missy Elliott) should ensure public acceptance of the music computer file as an alternative to the CD. The potential payoff is enormous. Last year, sales of online music amounted to roughly $1 million, according to Boston-based Forrester Research. They are expected to rise to as much as $4bn by 2003. But all this depends not only on the acceptance of common standards of transmission, copyright protection and storage, but on the adoption of 'broadband' pipes and the marriage of the hi-fi and the computer, all elements that, in theory again, the muscle of AOL can help facilitate.

Julie Urquhart, a public relations consultant in London, had no idea her card details had been stolen until she was refused credit in a furniture store. 'I wanted to buy a piece of furniture and my card was rejected. I know I had about \u00a33,000 credit available on it, so I rang the credit card company to find out what was going on.' </p> <p>Urquhart was told she had just spent \u00a32,500 on clothes in a Paris shop. When she told them she had been nowhere near Paris for some time, the credit card company, MBNA, launched an investigation, and the bill was removed from her account. </p> <p>The firm told Urquhart her card had been cloned, and asked whether she had used it for any purchases on the Internet. 'That started alarm bells ringing.

And the cost of genuine unauthorised transactions on your credit card should be picked up by the credit card company - not by you. Cardholders are legally obliged to pay the first \u00a350, but many credit card companies, including Barclaycard, waive this rule and cover the lot themselves. </p> <p>Williams points out that although credit card fraud on the Internet has received a lot of publicity, similar problems have occurred for a long time with customers making mail order or telephone purchases. Although Internet card fraud is increasing, the problem is still small compared with counterfeiting and card theft. </p> <p>Only 1 per cent of credit card losses incurred last year were caused by Internet-related fraud, says the Association for Payment Clearing Services.

      "body": "<p>After months of controversy about rip-off deals, the Government last week announced plans to clean up the mortgage industry. But the plans immediately ran into a storm of criticism because they are thought by many - lenders and consumer lobbyists alike - to amount to little more than a money-saving fudge. </p> <p>The regime outlined by Melanie Johnson, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Howard Davies, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, will cost the industry around \u00a35 million, against \u00a332m for the tougher system favoured by critics. </p> <p>Philip Telford, senior policy researcher with the Consumers' Association, describes the plan as a 'mish-mash'. </p> <p> <strong> What exactly is the Government planning?</strong> <br> Lenders will have to be authorised by the Financial Services Authority to sell homeloans. They will have to spell out the way their deals work and make clear any redemption penalties and charges. </p> <p> <strong> Sounds reasonable. What's the problem?</strong> <br> They will be under no obligation to tell you which deal is best for you: advice will not be regulated. </p> <p>That smiling bank or building society employee wearing a 'mortgage adviser' badge could, in theory, recommend an unsuitable deal. Provided there is no unfair fine print and all the paperwork is correct, you would have no comeback if you end up with a bad deal. The same will be true of mortgage brokers. </p> <p>This approach to policing mortgages - governed only by a voluntary code at present - contrasts with the system for pension and investment advisers. They are obliged to recommend the most suitable product. So if you go to an independent adviser for a financial makeover, he or she will be obliged to recommend the best pension. </p> <p>But the decision about your mortgage is, basically, up to you. </p> <p>Telford says: 'We will have even more confusion because consumers faced with apparent regulation of mortgages will go in good faith for advice which will not be regulated effectively.' </p> <p>Barbara Saunders, chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel - official consumer adviser to the FSA - said: 'The Government's partial response to public pressure will leave consumers confused, and unprotected against poor advice. The Consumer Panel is baffled. Why has the Government not addressed major concerns about the quality and suitability of advice?' </p> <p> <strong> But we all know investment advisers get it wrong and are open to being influenced by commission. So maybe this is the best way forward?</strong> <br> Howard Davies certainly argues that the risk to consumers from getting it wrong with a mortgage is not as great as getting it wrong on an investment or pension. Melanie Johnson argues that the problems in the mortgage market stem from poor or misleading information rather than poor advice. Consumers will be equipped with better information on which to base their decisions and competition in the market will be 'more meaningful'. </p> <p>But Telford argues that while there will continue to be a plethora of mortgages, consumers will be left to their own devices when it comes to making a decision. </p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it was 'surprised' that the Government had decided not to regulate advice or require mortgage brokers to be directly authorised under the FSA. </p> <p> <strong> So will the Government be banning unfair loans?</strong> <br> No. It is not attempting to control the way mortgages are constructed. There will still be loans with hefty redemption penalties and complicated terms. They hope the really poor ones will disappear because clear explanations will make consumers avoid them. </p> <p>The FSA is also trying to promote better awareness of mortgages, and has published a booklet, the FSA Guide to Repaying Your Mortgage. But its length - 46 pages - helps confirm the suspicions that choosing a homeloan can be a complicated business. </p> <p>The nagging doubt is that borrowers strapped for cash and time will still be seduced by knockdown rates, even if they face big penalties. </p> <p> <strong> But what if I feel too nervous to choose a loan from the thousands on the market?</strong> <br> The Government is planning to launch a benchmarking scheme to guide consumers. These loans will be marketed with a Catmark (standing for Charges, Access, Terms). </p> <p> <strong> How exactly will the Catmark work?</strong> <br> Lenders can choose whether they offer Catmarked loans or not. There will be two types. One will be a variable-rate loan, where interest can be no more than 2 per cent above the prevailing bank base rate, and there must be no early redemption penalties. </p> <p>Lenders may also offer a fixed or capped Catmark loan subject to precise rules including a ban on redemption penalties beyond the fixed or capped rate. </p> <p>Neither Catmarked loan should impose charges to insure the lender if it loses money through repossession. Interest must be credited daily so that borrowers are not paying interest on debt repaid, and all fees must be disclosed upfront. </p> <p> <strong> Will a Cat be the cheapest?</strong> <br> Almost certainly not. Lenders will be able to offer cheaper deals, but these won't bear a Cat mark. But the cheaper the loan, the more likely that it will carry high charges and redemption penalties. Lenders will not be compelled to offer a Catmarked product. </p> <p> <strong> And second mortgages?</strong> <br> There is some confusion but it seems that if a double glazing salesman appears on your doorstep offering a loan to finance your new windows, or you are attracted by a money lender offering to pay off other debts, it is unlikely the lenders will be policed. The new arrangements will exclude loans that are not taken out primarily for residential purposes. </p> <p>Nor will the legislation cover loans for less than \u00a325,000. If you extend an existing loan, this should be covered because it is part of your residential mortgage. But if you get a standalone, secured loan for less than \u00a325,000 from somewhere else, it won't be. Smaller secured loans are covered by the Consumer Credit Act and consumer credit licensing regulations, policed by the Office of Fair Trading. But, beware: there are longstanding concerns about the robustness of this regulatory regime. </p> <p> <strong> This is all very well but my problem is an endowment loan that I've been told may not pay off my mortgage. Will this help?</strong> <br> No, for two reasons. The legislation will not cover past transactions. And in any case you are, strictly speaking, covered already for advice on endowments under the Financial Services Act. </p> <p>You may be able to make a case for redress if you believe you were misled about an existing endowment, but you would have to prove that the policy was mis-sold. </p> <p> <strong> Actually, I've been stung twice, once by the endowment and once by a \u00a35,000 penalty to get out of my pricey fixed rate. Any luck with the new regime?</strong> <br> No. It is a pre-existing contract. The Office of Fair Trading can force lenders to unravel unfair penalty clauses. But you would have to make a strong case. The Consumers' Association also has powers to take action over unfair contracts and is in discussion at present with many lenders over penalties. But changes are more likely to apply to loans marketed in future. </p> <p><strong>Make sure it's up to scratch</strong></p> <p><strong>How the changes will help you to avoid a bad deal</strong></p> <p> \u0095 information on charges and penalties to be spelt out clearly </p> <p> \u0095 lenders required to give clear information in advertising </p> <p> \u0095 benchmarked - Catmarked - loans for people who want a straightforward deal </p> <p> \u0095 lenders to be fined, or thrown out of the business, if they don't explain their products clearly </p> <p> \u0095 complaints can go to the streamlined financial services ombudsman scheme </p> <p><strong> Why you'll still need to be on your guard</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 no policing of advisers, so no obligation on them to give advice on the best loan </p> <p> \u0095 brokers won't be regulated </p> <p>\u0095 responsibility for choosing a loan rests with the borrower, who is promised clear information to help </p> <p>\u0095 second mortgages under \u00a325,000 will not be covered. Beware secured debt-consolidation loans </p> <p> \u0095 Catmarked loans won't necessarily be the cheapest available, but the cheapest won't necessarily be the best </p>",

The regime outlined by Melanie Johnson, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Howard Davies, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, will cost the industry around \u00a35 million, against \u00a332m for the tougher system favoured by critics. Philip Telford, senior policy researcher with the Consumers' Association, describes the plan as a 'mish-mash'. What exactly is the Government planning? Lenders will have to be authorised by the Financial Services Authority to sell homeloans. They will have to spell out the way their deals work and make clear any redemption penalties and charges. Sounds reasonable. What's the problem? They will be under no obligation to tell you which deal is best for you: advice will not be regulated. That smiling bank or building society employee wearing a 'mortgage adviser' badge could, in theory, recommend an unsuitable deal. Provided there is no unfair fine print and all the paperwork is correct, you would have no comeback if you end up with a bad deal. The same will be true of mortgage brokers. This approach to policing mortgages - governed only by a voluntary code at present - contrasts with the system for pension and investment advisers. They are obliged to recommend the most suitable product. So if you go to an independent adviser for a financial makeover, he or she will be obliged to recommend the best pension. But the decision about your mortgage is, basically, up to you. Telford says: 'We will have even more confusion because consumers faced with apparent regulation of mortgages will go in good faith for advice which will not be regulated effectively.' Barbara Saunders, chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel - official consumer adviser to the FSA - said: 'The Government's partial response to public pressure will leave consumers confused, and unprotected against poor advice. The Consumer Panel is baffled. Why has the Government not addressed major concerns about the quality and suitability of advice?' But we all know investment advisers get it wrong and are open to being influenced by commission. So maybe this is the best way forward? Howard Davies certainly argues that the risk to consumers from getting it wrong with a mortgage is not as great as getting it wrong on an investment or pension. Melanie Johnson argues that the problems in the mortgage market stem from poor or misleading information rather than poor advice. Consumers will be equipped with better information on which to base their decisions and competition in the market will be 'more meaningful'. But Telford argues that while there will continue to be a plethora of mortgages, consumers will be left to their own devices when it comes to making a decision. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it was 'surprised' that the Government had decided not to regulate advice or require mortgage brokers to be directly authorised under the FSA. So will the Government be banning unfair loans? No. It is not attempting to control the way mortgages are constructed. There will still be loans with hefty redemption penalties and complicated terms. They hope the really poor ones will disappear because clear explanations will make consumers avoid them. The FSA is also trying to promote better awareness of mortgages, and has published a booklet, the FSA Guide to Repaying Your Mortgage. But its length - 46 pages - helps confirm the suspicions that choosing a homeloan can be a complicated business. The nagging doubt is that borrowers strapped for cash and time will still be seduced by knockdown rates, even if they face big penalties. But what if I feel too nervous to choose a loan from the thousands on the market? The Government is planning to launch a benchmarking scheme to guide consumers. These loans will be marketed with a Catmark (standing for Charges, Access, Terms). How exactly will the Catmark work? Lenders can choose whether they offer Catmarked loans or not. There will be two types. One will be a variable-rate loan, where interest can be no more than 2 per cent above the prevailing bank base rate, and there must be no early redemption penalties. Lenders may also offer a fixed or capped Catmark loan subject to precise rules including a ban on redemption penalties beyond the fixed or capped rate. Neither Catmarked loan should impose charges to insure the lender if it loses money through repossession. Interest must be credited daily so that borrowers are not paying interest on debt repaid, and all fees must be disclosed upfront. Will a Cat be the cheapest? Almost certainly not. Lenders will be able to offer cheaper deals, but these won't bear a Cat mark. But the cheaper the loan, the more likely that it will carry high charges and redemption penalties. Lenders will not be compelled to offer a Catmarked product. And second mortgages? There is some confusion but it seems that if a double glazing salesman appears on your doorstep offering a loan to finance your new windows, or you are attracted by a money lender offering to pay off other debts, it is unlikely the lenders will be policed. The new arrangements will exclude loans that are not taken out primarily for residential purposes. Nor will the legislation cover loans for less than \u00a325,000. If you extend an existing loan, this should be covered because it is part of your residential mortgage. But if you get a standalone, secured loan for less than \u00a325,000 from somewhere else, it won't be. Smaller secured loans are covered by the Consumer Credit Act and consumer credit licensing regulations, policed by the Office of Fair Trading. But, beware: there are longstanding concerns about the robustness of this regulatory regime. This is all very well but my problem is an endowment loan that I've been told may not pay off my mortgage. Will this help? No, for two reasons. The legislation will not cover past transactions. And in any case you are, strictly speaking, covered already for advice on endowments under the Financial Services Act. You may be able to make a case for redress if you believe you were misled about an existing endowment, but you would have to prove that the policy was mis-sold. Actually, I've been stung twice, once by the endowment and once by a \u00a35,000 penalty to get out of my pricey fixed rate. Any luck with the new regime? No. It is a pre-existing contract. The Office of Fair Trading can force lenders to unravel unfair penalty clauses. But you would have to make a strong case. The Consumers' Association also has powers to take action over unfair contracts and is in discussion at present with many lenders over penalties. But changes are more likely to apply to loans marketed in future. Make sure it's up to scratch How the changes will help you to avoid a bad deal \u0095 information on charges and penalties to be spelt out clearly \u0095 lenders required to give clear information in advertising \u0095 benchmarked - Catmarked - loans for people who want a straightforward deal \u0095 lenders to be fined, or thrown out of the business, if they don't explain their products clearly \u0095 complaints can go to the streamlined financial services ombudsman scheme Why you'll still need to be on your guard \u0095 no policing of advisers, so no obligation on them to give advice on the best loan \u0095 brokers won't be regulated \u0095 responsibility for choosing a loan rests with the borrower, who is promised clear information to help \u0095 second mortgages under \u00a325,000 will not be covered. Beware secured debt-consolidation loans \u0095 Catmarked loans won't necessarily be the cheapest available, but the cheapest won't necessarily be the best",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Starting an exercise programme may seem like the hardest part, but often the really tricky bit occurs when you've been working out for a while and you're starting to feel your enthusiasm falter. Over half the people who start an exercise programme in the New Year have quit by March because they can't summon up the motivation they need to continue. Lack of interest in exercise happens to everyone at some point, but what makes the difference between those that it causes to quit for good and those that overcome the blip is knowing how to minimise the number of times it hits you and what to do when it does.</p> <p><b>Step one</b></p> <p>Be outPUT not outCOME focused - while knowing what you want to achieve from an exercise programme is vital for success, it shouldn't be your main motivating factor when you work out day to day. For this, it's far better to think in terms of what you'll physically achieve in each session. 'People have a results-based attention span of two to three weeks and if they don't see changes like weight or inches lost in that time, they'll get demoralised and quit,' says exercise psychologist Stuart Biddle. 'Problem is, in terms of making big physical changes, exercise doesn't work that fast.' The answer is to determine your ideal outcome, work out the best exercise plan to achieve it, and then you forget it. From now on only set yourself output-focused goals looking at bettering yourself in terms of what you can achieve. Maybe you want to walk three miles in 35 minutes this session or increase all your weights by half a kilo. Choose a goal and work your session aiming for it. Next session, choose something new. Only measure your original goal after a month or six weeks. Chances are, you'll be pleasantly surprised, and from then on, results will come faster.</p> <p><b>Step two</b></p> <p>Use your ESP - exercise sensory perception. 'Many of us go through periods when training feels like a chore but if we can tap into our ESP, we'll discover the pleasure that exercise can bring,' says Michael Gerrish, author of When Working Out Isn't Working Out (available via www.amazon.co.uk). ESP is that feeling you get when you're working out and your body feels good. Knowing how to get into your ESP zone is a great motivator. It could be through the speed you work, the rhythm you get into, even the intensity you use, and it could vary from day to day - sometimes there's nothing better than a really hard fast run, other days you'll want to hill walk and feel the burn in your calves. Every time you work out, tap into what you think your body feels it needs to do (not what you think you should do) and you'll find your workout more enjoyable.</p> <p><b>Step three</b></p> <p>Vary what you do - not only does this boost fitness benefits (if you do the same workout too many times, your body gets used to it and you'll stop making gains), it's also a huge psychological boost. 'It's what we call having ownership of the exercise,' says Stuart Biddle. 'The more choice you have about what you're going to do that day, the more likely you are to enjoy it and stick to it long term.' If you can't vary your activities, vary things like speed, intensity - or even the way you progress round the gym. Doing your programme backwards can really stimulate you - mentally and physically. If you're stuck for ideas, try writing a list of activities on bits of paper and pulling one out of a hat each day, or try Matt Roberts' buddy system. 'Working out with someone else is a great motivator, but if you prefer to exercise alone, using someone else's ideas can be enough to help you. Get together with a fitness-minded pal, or someone at the gym whose look you admire. Ask them to set you an activity or a goal to incorporate into your workout that day or week - and stick to it. Next time, ask someone else. You'll end up with a huge variety of exercise moves - and you won't get bored.'</p> <p><b>Step four</b></p> <p>Use external motivators - music, reading, chatting to friends - even watching TV - can help a difficult workout go faster - for example, studies have shown that exercisers who work out to music are likely to exercise harder and for longer than those who don't. External motivators can also help you make the routine part of your life. One of the fastest growing trends in US gyms is internet access terminals attached to exercise bikes or steppers allowing people to work while they work out. 'Some people find that this not only takes their mind off what they're doing physically, it can also absolve the guilt about taking time to work out,' says Stuart Biddle. Dual-purpose timing also makes the difference between having to make the time to workout and finding it naturally in your day. 'For example, if you time a home-exercise plan with watching your favourite soap, it creates a natural time break that you can devote to exercise,' he says. 'Which can dramatically increase your chance of sticking to it.'</p> <p><b>Step five</b></p> <p>Or try an internal power boost - 'It may sound like a clich\u00e9, but using visual imagery can really encourage you on those days when you get to the gym but just don't feel like powering up,' says Elesa Argent. 'Believing you can do something is half the battle, and your body is amazingly susceptible to suggestion. If you start to think that you can run three miles, if you start to see yourself racing others, if you forget about everything that's going on around you and focus only on the good things your body is doing, you'll often find you'll work harder than you intended.'</p> <p>If you're going to use visual imagery, here's how to use it to your best advantage. Start working out at a moderate intensity for about 10 minutes - that's generally how long it takes for the endorphins in the brain to kick in and for your breathing to regulate, making the exercise a little easier. Now power-up your plan, working not flat out, but about 20 per cent harder than you wanted to work today. As you do, see every muscle working harder and harder, think about each one working and what it can achieve. Don't focus on time - visualise yourself running the marathon, cycling the route to a place you really love or something else that gives you a sense of achievement or pleasure.</p> <p><b>Step six</b></p> <p>Don't be afraid to take a rest day. 'Sometimes a day off from your programme can be an extremely powerful motivator,' says Stuart Biddle. 'You have to do exercise because you want to, not because you feel you should. So if your body really is telling you it needs a day off, take it without guilt and get back into your programme on your next scheduled day. You'll feel revived and probably work twice as hard.'</p> <p><b>Step seven</b></p> <p>But don't slack off too often. The problem with exercise is if you don't keep it up, you lose gains pretty quickly both physically and mentally. Exercise increases levels of brain chemicals called endorphins which improve mood and energy. Keeping active maintains these levels and actually encourages you to exercise. However, if you stop working out for two or three days, endorphin levels drop, reducing mood and energy and making you less inclined to work out. What's more, if you miss three or four sessions you'll actually start to lose physical fitness making the routine harder the next time you go back. Skip sessions for two weeks and you'll be about 15 per cent less fit than you were when you stopped. 'The rule is that whenever you say you're going to exercise, you try and do something,' says Matt Roberts. 'Even if it's only walking.' It's like taking exercise snack breaks. If you can't eat a big meal, at least have something to tide you over until you can. In exercise terms this might be a brisk walk, a 10-minute cycle or a swim, but it will make the difference.</p> <p><b>Step Eight</b></p> <p>Always take a benefit break. Once your workout is over, spending five minutes thinking about how you feel could get you back into that class or gym the next day. 'Studies have shown that people who recognise the positive way that exercise makes them feel and the health benefits they receive from every workout stick at the plan much longer than those who don't,' says Stuart Biddle. 'When you finish your workout, either in the shower or while you cool down, think about how you feel. The improved energy, the sense of vitality, perhaps even the slight ache in your muscles - and remember that feeling. Think about what you achieved and how far you've come - and the next time you don't want to exercise, bring this to mind. It'll get you there, I promise.'</p> <p><b>Sabotage</b> - how others can affect your workout</p> <p>Positive social support is one of the most important ways you can be motivated to work out. This doesn't necessarily mean that friends and family have to come to the gym and work out with you (although that does help). Often what's more important is the way they react to your exercise plans. 'Whether it's how they act, choose words or use the tone of their voice, the way that your family and friends relate to you can affect how you view getting fit,' says Michael Gerrish, who proclaims negative family reactions as one of his Unidentified Fitness Obstacles, or UFOs. He cites examples of friends and family making exercisers feel guilty for taking time out to go to the gym or who criticise weight loss or figures gains out of jealousy or because it causes them to reflect badly on their own bodies. He also points out that many of us stop exercising when our figures change because we're worried about how others may react to us now we're not the people they once knew. 'It's important you see these comments for what they are and deal with them so they don't hold you back,' he explains. 'Tell people if they're going to involve themselves in your workout, you'd only like pats on the back. If they can't do that, say you'd rather they didn't say anything. It may be difficult, but it'll be worth it in the long run.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>The post-Christmas, New Year weeks are notoriously bad when it comes to moods. Daylight hours are few, debt can be at its highest and the exhaustion can manifest itself as depression, in its true clinical sense, or as a milder, negative state of mind. It's not a coincidence that we feel this way after a month of unbalanced eating - how can we expect our brain to feel good if we haven't fed it the right ingredients?</p> <p>Our stomach provides the brain with the raw materials it needs to manufacture the necessary quantities of hormones, so we do indeed have the opportunity to change our moods by altering our diets. In particular, food can directly influence the production of certain neurotransmitters (chemicals that pass messages from one nerve to another), called endorphins, which help to lift us out of the doldrums and keep us in the happy zone. Food, however, can only help correct a low endorphin level and bring it back into the coping zone - it's not a question of being able to experience permanent highs if you consume vast quantities of endorphin producers. If only.</p> <p>Endorphin levels can be low any time of the year as a result of a genetic predisposition, a poor diet, excessive drinking, as a consequence of suffering from health problems such as flu or iron-deficiency anaemia. Depression can also be exaggerated by certain drugs such as diuretics, as they can cause the body to lose excessive amounts of potassium, which, when deficient, alter your mood. Food can help correct these imbalances by influencing the production of two specific endorphins called serotonin and noradrenaline.</p> <p><b>The mood-boosters</b></p> <p>Serotonin and noradrenaline are derived mainly from sugary and carbohydrate-rich foods, which is why some people feel happy after they have eaten chocolate, bowls of mashed potato, tubs of ice cream or thick slices of crusty white bread. It also explains why we crave steamed puddings or malted chocolate drinks and gravitate towards bowls of pasta during the dark and dreary months. But before reaching for these foods, you need to be aware that the sugar from sweet foods - chocolate, biscuits and sweets - is rapidly absorbed into the blood, causing an initial boost in serotonin levels in the brain. This sounds a good thing, but unfortunately the sudden rise in blood sugar brings about a rapid rise in the production of insulin, a hormone that takes sugar from the blood into the cells, where it's used as energy.</p> <p>The result being that the blood-sugar level slumps, therefore your endorphin and mood levels quickly follow suit, meaning you feel even lousier than you did before. The body tries to keep up with these sugar swings by tempting you to eat another biscuit to bring your mood back up, but this only creates a vicious circle that's impossible to break. The more sweets you eat, the more you'll need to make yourself feel happy, and your moods will swing all over the place.</p> <p>The best way to experience the highs without the lows is to ensure you have a meal as soon as possible after you eat sweets or snack food, or better still, get your endorphin boost from a more slowly absorbed carbohydrate - starch - such as pasta or mashed potato. The complexity of the starch structure makes the breakdown of the carbohydrate into sugar (which will produce the endorphins), a slower process.</p> <p>However, the most slowly absorbed carbs, and therefore the foods that will keep you happy for longest, are the ones that also contain fibre (which, in the presence of water, buffers the absorption of sugar) - an oaty flapjack, dried fruit, even fruit crumble made with a wholemeal topping - all of which can seem more appealing than a cold apple at this time of year. These are very useful foods for boosting happy hormones in gloomy children or teenagers. If you can coax them into eating citrus fruits such as oranges, kiwis and berries, these are especially good because they not only contain fibre and slow-release sugars, they also contain vitamin C which enhances endorphin production - a glass of fresh fruit juice provides a perfect start to the day; a couple of tangerines can give us an excellent afternoon mood-boost.</p> <p><b>Savouries to keep you sweet</b></p> <p>If you have more of a savoury tooth, serotonin and noradrenalin can also be made from tryptophan and l-phenyl alanine, two amino acids present in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, cheese and eggs. To ensure a good mood, aim to eat one gram of protein per kilo of your body weight every day - that equates for most people to a large chicken-breast sized piece of protein portion at your main meal, and half this quantity for your second meal. I find that vegetarians, and vegans in particular, can suffer from low-protein mood-related problems if they don't manage to balance their intake of amino acids by including generous portions of non-animal protein. A protein portion could be two eggs, about 150g/5oz cooked weight of pulses, 90g/3oz nuts (be careful with children) or 225g/8oz tofu. Since non- animal proteins don't contain the full spectrum of essential amino acids, strict vegetarians should also accompany each of their protein foods (pulses, nuts, lentils, tofu, etc) with a cereal food (such as pasta, bread or rice) in both meals. This combination will ensure the body receives the right protein balance.</p> <p>Low protein intakes also explain the diet blues which can affect people who try to coerce the body into losing weight by skimping on the amino acids. The same goes for people who cut corners when work gets hectic and end up having just a bag of chips or a chocolate bar instead of a proper meal in the evening. To boost the mood, and not the weight, choose lean roasts, fish soups or oily fish baked in sea salt, hotpots, game or chicken stuffed with lemons and herbs, lentil bakes, beany soups - if you keep the fats and sugars low, the overall calorie intake can be within healthy limits and you can still feel happy.</p> <p><b>Feeling drained?</b></p> <p>Don't overdo the caffeine or alcohol.</p> <p>Caffeine in excess of two to three cups a day and excess alcohol, especially when drunk on an empty stomach, both drain the body of much-needed mood-boosting vitamins and minerals. Excess caffeine can also make you feel hyped up and exaggerate sugar swings by dramatically increasing the quantity of insulin the pancreas produces. So treat yourself to a few cups, but make up your fluid intake by drinking two and a half litres of either water and/or herbal teas a day. Note that if you decide to dramatically reduce the amount of caffeine you drink, you may experience a caffeine-withdrawal headache. But persevere - many people suffering from low moods feel substantially better when their body isn't overloaded with caffeine.</p> <p>The vicious circle some people who are feeling low slip into is the one which plunges them into not feeling like eating - so the body is deprived of essential mood-boosting vitamins and minerals present in vegetables and fruits, such as vitamins C and B12, iron, potassium and zinc. Deficiencies in these nutrients can cause you to feel low, or aggravate depression. On top of this, there are some antidepressants which change your metabolism and cause your body to become deficient in these nutrients, depressed and off your food.</p> <p>Try to break this cycle and avoid the deficiencies by choosing something easy to prepare. It doesn't matter if it's cooked or not, ready-made meal or takeaway - something is better than nothing. The ideal, of course, is to choose fresh foods, such as stir-fries, grilled vegetables, even cheese and tomato on toast - foods which aren't loaded with additives and preservatives. Don't forget that dull and boring food will completely turn you off, whereas food that tastes, looks and smells good is much more likely to make you happy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>At the far end of my fishmonger's counter - next to the sink where his lads skin, fillet and gut - lie a handful of delicacies that tempt as much as any lobster or scallop on its shell. I think delicacy is the right word, special and old-fashioned, for the row of bronze and pink smoked trout, the copper and jet kippers and the black and golden smoked mackerel that await in rank and file. The right word, too, for the translucent lobes of cod's roe that will end up as the best taramasalata or just scraped thinly on hot toast, the sheets of ready-sliced salmon and the pale, moist sides of honey-coloured smoked haddock. Sometimes, just sometimes, there are pairs of Arbroath smokies, the baby haddocks that are sold in pairs tied up with string and look as old as time.</p> <p>I like a piece of smoked haddock for my tea. I poach it in milk and water with a bay leaf and some black pepper or pop it under the grill, then slowly rub a slice of butter over it with my knife till it melts and runs down on to the plate. For dinner, I'll make fishcakes, mashing the creamy fish with hotter flavours such as Tabasco or mustard. Occasionally, I flake the fish into a soup with dried beans of some sort and maybe some cream.</p> <p>My fishmonger smokes much of his own haddock, but originally the fish was salted and smoked so that it might last the journey from the North to London. In Victorian times, Finnan haddock, named after the village of Findon near Aberdeen, would have been smoked long enough to have taken the stagecoach to London, though nowadays we probably prefer something a mite more subtle. Even the hideous yellow dyes so popular in the Sixties and Seventies have fallen from favour, with most customers preferring something softer-hued and without any sort of colouring. I still see annatto-tinted fillets around, usually imprisoned in clingfilm on a bright blue tray in the supermarket. They must catch up.</p> <p>I know the temptation is to poach the fish in a shallow dish with milk and water, and it does produce an elegantly simple tea, but you really don't need to stop there. By swapping cream for the water, you end up with one of those dreamy smoke-and-cream sauces that seem so right for cool weather. You will need something starchy on the side, though, perhaps potatoes that you have boiled and pushed through a ricer, or some beans or lentils. Smoked haddock with slate-green Puy lentils and a spoonful of the creamy baking juices is a treat indeed. Butter beans, pre-boiled then cooked with the fish and the cream, are utter bliss.</p> <p>A lifelong dislike of eggs has taught me to be suspicious of ordering smoked haddock in restaurants - the fish inevitably arrives at table with the traditional, yet daft, accompaniment of a poached egg. Like a finicky child, I cannot even have the offending item on my plate. The egg has to go. Let them say what they like about the arrogance of chefs, the kitchen at one of Marco Pierre White's establishments once removed a soft-boiled egg from my piece of fish without so much as a raised eyebrow; the fact that it was a particularly quivering and perilously perched oeuf was even more to their credit. </p> <p>Smoked haddock makes a cracking addition to a fish pie. Use it half-and-half with a plain haddock or hake. There is just enough smokiness to add interest, yet not quite enough to intrude on the mild, creamy blandness that means so much in the cold weather. Those who have no choice but to buy the dyed variety can console themselves with the welcome flecks of colour in the filling. Smoked fish is rather nice with mashed potatoes, not just in a pie but added to fishcakes. I have even had smoked salmon fishcakes - hopefully made with the trimmings - that proved the rule. </p> <p>A smoked haddock has more friends than you could shake a fishing line at. Mushrooms, cream, tomatoes - especially grilled - and potatoes of any sort will all comfortably share a plate with it. It is just lovely with steamed runner beans. The real marriage must, I think, be smoked haddock with spinach. Washed and steamed in just the water caught in its leaves, spinach is a natural match for this fish. Try roughly chopping the steamed leaves and folding them into a classic and all-too-rarely-made parsley sauce. Cabbage should not share a plate with smoked haddock, but you will probably get away with peas. </p> <p>If you come across the rare and elusive smokies, then do snap them up. I reckon they have the best flavour of all. A West Country restaurateur I once worked with used to bake them in little cocotte dishes, the fish first flaked then mixed with local cream, Worcestershire sauce, a tiny shake of tomato ketchup and some soft flakes of grated Cheddar. We then grilled them till they bubbled, and served the creamy, smoky, fishy mess with triangles of hot toast. </p> <p><strong>Smoked haddock with butter beans and spinach</strong></p> <p>Little things count, and haddock cooked this way will improve immeasurably if you can be bothered to skin the butter beans and remember to add bay leaves and butter to the poaching milk. The parsley is important here, and should be vivid, emerald green and full of life. </p> <p>I see no reason why you can't use equally mealy cannellini beans, if that is what you have, though there is something about flat, oversized butter beans that makes them as soothing in the mouth as those golden discs of toffee you can never find enough of in a tin of Quality Street. </p> <p>A consoling dish. Serves 2</p> <p>250g butter beans <br>butter <br>400g smoked haddock <br>250ml milk, plus a little more for later <br>bay leaves <br>a good fistful of parsley leaves <br>300ml double cream <br>1 heaped tbsp grain mustard</p> <p>spinach, to serve</p> <p>Soak the beans overnight in cold water. They should plump up nicely. Drain them, then bring them to the boil in deep water and let them go at a rolling boil for a full 10 minutes. Don't salt it - it will toughen the beans.

      "bodyText": "At the far end of my fishmonger's counter - next to the sink where his lads skin, fillet and gut - lie a handful of delicacies that tempt as much as any lobster or scallop on its shell. I think delicacy is the right word, special and old-fashioned, for the row of bronze and pink smoked trout, the copper and jet kippers and the black and golden smoked mackerel that await in rank and file. The right word, too, for the translucent lobes of cod's roe that will end up as the best taramasalata or just scraped thinly on hot toast, the sheets of ready-sliced salmon and the pale, moist sides of honey-coloured smoked haddock. Sometimes, just sometimes, there are pairs of Arbroath smokies, the baby haddocks that are sold in pairs tied up with string and look as old as time. I like a piece of smoked haddock for my tea. I poach it in milk and water with a bay leaf and some black pepper or pop it under the grill, then slowly rub a slice of butter over it with my knife till it melts and runs down on to the plate. For dinner, I'll make fishcakes, mashing the creamy fish with hotter flavours such as Tabasco or mustard. Occasionally, I flake the fish into a soup with dried beans of some sort and maybe some cream. My fishmonger smokes much of his own haddock, but originally the fish was salted and smoked so that it might last the journey from the North to London. In Victorian times, Finnan haddock, named after the village of Findon near Aberdeen, would have been smoked long enough to have taken the stagecoach to London, though nowadays we probably prefer something a mite more subtle. Even the hideous yellow dyes so popular in the Sixties and Seventies have fallen from favour, with most customers preferring something softer-hued and without any sort of colouring. I still see annatto-tinted fillets around, usually imprisoned in clingfilm on a bright blue tray in the supermarket. They must catch up. I know the temptation is to poach the fish in a shallow dish with milk and water, and it does produce an elegantly simple tea, but you really don't need to stop there. By swapping cream for the water, you end up with one of those dreamy smoke-and-cream sauces that seem so right for cool weather. You will need something starchy on the side, though, perhaps potatoes that you have boiled and pushed through a ricer, or some beans or lentils. Smoked haddock with slate-green Puy lentils and a spoonful of the creamy baking juices is a treat indeed. Butter beans, pre-boiled then cooked with the fish and the cream, are utter bliss. A lifelong dislike of eggs has taught me to be suspicious of ordering smoked haddock in restaurants - the fish inevitably arrives at table with the traditional, yet daft, accompaniment of a poached egg. Like a finicky child, I cannot even have the offending item on my plate. The egg has to go. Let them say what they like about the arrogance of chefs, the kitchen at one of Marco Pierre White's establishments once removed a soft-boiled egg from my piece of fish without so much as a raised eyebrow; the fact that it was a particularly quivering and perilously perched oeuf was even more to their credit. Smoked haddock makes a cracking addition to a fish pie. Use it half-and-half with a plain haddock or hake. There is just enough smokiness to add interest, yet not quite enough to intrude on the mild, creamy blandness that means so much in the cold weather. Those who have no choice but to buy the dyed variety can console themselves with the welcome flecks of colour in the filling. Smoked fish is rather nice with mashed potatoes, not just in a pie but added to fishcakes. I have even had smoked salmon fishcakes - hopefully made with the trimmings - that proved the rule. A smoked haddock has more friends than you could shake a fishing line at. Mushrooms, cream, tomatoes - especially grilled - and potatoes of any sort will all comfortably share a plate with it. It is just lovely with steamed runner beans. The real marriage must, I think, be smoked haddock with spinach. Washed and steamed in just the water caught in its leaves, spinach is a natural match for this fish. Try roughly chopping the steamed leaves and folding them into a classic and all-too-rarely-made parsley sauce. Cabbage should not share a plate with smoked haddock, but you will probably get away with peas. If you come across the rare and elusive smokies, then do snap them up. I reckon they have the best flavour of all. A West Country restaurateur I once worked with used to bake them in little cocotte dishes, the fish first flaked then mixed with local cream, Worcestershire sauce, a tiny shake of tomato ketchup and some soft flakes of grated Cheddar. We then grilled them till they bubbled, and served the creamy, smoky, fishy mess with triangles of hot toast. Smoked haddock with butter beans and spinach Little things count, and haddock cooked this way will improve immeasurably if you can be bothered to skin the butter beans and remember to add bay leaves and butter to the poaching milk. The parsley is important here, and should be vivid, emerald green and full of life. I see no reason why you can't use equally mealy cannellini beans, if that is what you have, though there is something about flat, oversized butter beans that makes them as soothing in the mouth as those golden discs of toffee you can never find enough of in a tin of Quality Street. A consoling dish. Serves 2 250g butter beans butter 400g smoked haddock 250ml milk, plus a little more for later bay leaves a good fistful of parsley leaves 300ml double cream 1 heaped tbsp grain mustard spinach, to serve Soak the beans overnight in cold water. They should plump up nicely. Drain them, then bring them to the boil in deep water and let them go at a rolling boil for a full 10 minutes. Don't salt it - it will toughen the beans. Skim off the froth that rises, then turn down the heat so the water simmers less enthusiastically for an hour or so, till the beans are tender enough to squash between thumb and forefinger. Butter a baking dish generously, remove the skin from the haddock, and place it, rounded side up, in the buttered dish. Pour over the milk, then add enough water to almost cover the fish. Crumble in a couple of bay leaves - and I do think this is important - and grind over some black pepper. Bake at 200C/gas mark 6 for about 25 minutes or until you can pull out one of the large, fat flakes of fish with ease. Drain and discard the milk. Can you bear to skin the beans?

Meanwhile, steam or boil the spinach - a matter of two or three minutes - then drain it thoroughly and divide, with the haddock and beans, between two warmed plates. Smoked haddock cakes A soft, smoky fishcake with a little warmth from mustard and Tabasco. Enough for 4 600g potatoes 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped 30g butter 350g smoked haddock a little butter 150ml single cream 150ml milk 1 or two bay leaves several good shakes of the Tabasco bottle 2 heaped tsps Dijon mustard a little flour for shaping the cakes, and a little butter and oil for frying Cook the potatoes to tenderness, and without peeling them, in deep, salted water.

      "body": "<p>Around this time of year, inexperienced gardeners start to get the feeling that they ought to be pruning something, but are not quite sure what it is; and that while they delay, there are boats - big, important boats - being missed. All nonsense, of course. Cast your cares aside with ne'er so much as a backward glance. Pruning is not a science. It is certainly a skill and can become an art, but these are things that can be acquired and enjoyed with very little time or effort.</p> <p>The trouble is that pruning is imbued with a corrective discipline. It is very New Labour. You can see that there is a natural progression from pager to secateurs in the apotheosis of the Millbank apparatchik. Pruning is all about control and, in time, every right-thinking, sensible plant will learn that the hardest cuts are the kindest of all. In theory, that applies to all plants of any kind, including grass, and in practice there is hardly any kind of gardening that does not involve some sort of restraining, trimming or shaping. But let's agree that for the moment we are talking about cutting back woody growth. Certainly hedge-cutting is pruning, as is delicately deadheading roses.</p> <p>You prune for three distinct reasons: to restrict growth, to promote growth and to curtail or cure damage from injury or disease. Whatever the desired effect is, you are going to have to cut, and it is vital that you do this with as sharp an instrument as possible, for all the obvious reasons, not least that it is easier. What you want to avoid at all costs is tearing the bark of whatever you are cutting, leaving a ragged edge and open surface. All the sustenance for any woody plant is carried just underneath the bark, so every cut must be 'clean'. Never assume that damaged or diseased wood will 'recover'. Far better to cut back to healthy wood to provoke replacement growth.</p> <p>Pruning nearly always promotes bushier, stronger growth. The harder you cut back something, the stronger it will grow. This happens because the hormones that control a plant's growth are concentrated around the buds at the end of a shoot, especially those growing vertically. Not only do these ensure that growth is strongest at these points, but these buds produce a chemical that actively inhibits the growth of any buds below them. So if you remove the tip of a shoot or branch, the lower buds are given a chance to develop. Once you have grasped this principle, most pruning is common sense. </p> <p>So when you regularly cut a plant or hedge back because you want to restrict its growth, the result is always thicker, rather than longer growth. The growing tips are regularly removed and the buds below them branch and thicken enthusiastically. As a general rule, pruning a branch or stem back hard at this time of year will encourage the new leading bud to grow with extra vigour. This is very evident in roses that are hard-pruned, or in fruit trees. This means that where you have a shrub with lopsided growth, you should ignore your instinct to cut back the vigorous part and instead cut the weakest growth back hard to provoke it into energetic reaction. </p> <p>Summer pruning, on the other hand, tends to encourage flower and leaf buds. The best example of this is deadheading, which involves pruning back the dead flowers only as far as the next leaf bud. When you do this, you remove growth hormones that are at their strongest at the growing tip and which actively suppress growth below that point. The point that you cut to becomes the new growing tip, and it will accumulate extra growth hormones of its own as a result. Therefore, if you want to rejuvenate a hedge or shrub, it is best to prune in winter, whereas if you want to encourage fresh, all-over growth, it is better to cut in summer.</p> <p>But I guess that most pruning angst at this time of year centres on the twin horrors of roses and clematis. There is no one answer to either, but both can be simplified. All roses dislike wet weather, so the more air that gets to them the less fungal trouble they will suffer. Good pruning creates good ventilation. Always hard-prune any rose after planting, even if it is a climber and comes with 6ft of top growth. It is your best chance of establishing really strong growth from the base of the plant. Also, it is always a good idea to remove any branches that are crossing or growing back into the centre of the plant, whatever the type of rose. So, it is always best to cut back to an outward-facing bud if possible. But it often is not, so don't be obsessive about it. And remember that no rose needs pruning, so there is no urgency.</p> <p>Shrub roses of all kinds can have all the extra-long growth cut back by a third. Take out any crossing or inward-growing branches. Remove any dead or very dodgy-looking stems, cutting right back to the ground. Leave the rest alone. A light trim with a hedge-cutter is a very effective alternative. Cut back damaged wood on hybrid teas to healthy growth. Clear the centre of the plant, trying to achieve a goblet shape with an empty centre. Cut back all stems by at least half, cutting the thinnest stems hardest.</p> <p>Climbing roses are best pruned in autumn but can be done now. Remove all old growth (of more than three years) to the lowest healthy junction with new growth. Try to leave half a dozen strong new shoots fanning upwards, and tie them in. Cut off all lateral growth from these half-dozen shoots to the last pair of buds or leaves. It is the new lateral growth that will produce this year's flowers. If you have a very neglected climbing rose, it is a good idea to cut a third of it down to the ground each year so that it replaces itself over three years.</p> <p>Rambling roses can be identified by the mass of small flowers they produce once in midsummer and by their very vigorous growth. The flowers are formed on the previous season's growth, so any pruning must take place immediately after flowering. If space is restricted - and roses like 'Kiftsgate' or 'Rambling Rector' can be very sprawling indeed - cut half the canes right down to within 6in of the ground each year. Otherwise leave them be.</p> <p>The critical factor with pruning clematis is its flowering time. If it flowers before June, you do not need to prune it at all except to restrict its sprawl. Clematis that fit this bill are Clematis montana, Carmandii, 'Marie Boisselot' and 'Nelly Moser'. The flowerbuds are produced on wood that ripened the previous summer, so prune it in spring and you get no flowers. If you must cut it back, do so in June. Clematis that flower after June - like all the viticella and 'Jackmanii' cultivars - make flowerbuds on new wood, so the harder you prune them, the more flowers they will have with the added virtue of growing extra-vigorously in response to the cutting back. If you do not prune them you get the familiar sight of 6ft or more of woody stem topped by a flurry of leaf and flower. Be ruthless. Be kind. Cut all these post-June clematis to the second-to-bottom healthy bud from the ground. I do ours at the beginning of March.</p> <p>Evergreens such as yew are traditionally pruned in late August/early September, which keeps them neat all winter, and new growth, with its disreputable shagginess, will not really get underway until the following summer. But much more important than when to prune is how to prune. There is only one rule really worth being pedantic about: always cut back to something. This could be a bud, a leaf or another stem. In the greater scheme of things, it does not matter what. When clipping a dense hedge, this is bound to happen. But when hand-pruning shrubs or climbers, it has to be part of the routine of each separate snip.</p> <p><strong>Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong></p> <p>Observer readers can buy a Complete Clematis Kit for \u00a317.99, including UK p&amp;p.

      "body": "<p>Most people seeing a psychiatrist do so once a week, but I've just talked to three in a single day. No wonder I'm confused. The world of psychotherapy, like the world of mental illness, is a maelstrom of meaningless words, contradictory messages and intimidating voices - quite literally, psychobabble - which is hard to navigate even with expert help. Add to this the fine distinctions (What is therapy? What is counselling?) and the jargon (therapies that can be 'cognitive-behavioural', or 'analytical', or 'dynamic') and you have a discourse Hamlet would be proud of.</p> <p>Then there is the stigma. Despite the cheerful 'analysis culture' of American sitcoms such as Ally McBeal and Friends, most people still find it hard to admit they need to see a therapist. The no-show rate for patients referred to psychotherapists is more than a third, and one consultant estimates that, 'If you told 100 people in the street that they needed psychotherapy, probably ten would take you up.' Some people are put off by the stereotype of the twisted Freudian 'shrink' lying you down on a couch and asking about your sexual fantasies. The main fear, however, is that asking for psychiatric help is a display of weakness and failure. Men in particular find it embarrassing to talk about their feelings, which may explain why - in one psychiatric practice I visited - the ratio of women to men seeking help is two to one. 'This isn't because women are twice as vulnerable,' says Dr Martin Deahl, a consultant in psychological medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. 'If you look at referrals to alcohol clinics, that ratio is reversed. Men self-medicate with alcohol.'</p> <p>Yet the stigma is based on ignorance. Dr Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m, who specialises in anxiety and neurosis at the Charter Clinic in Chelsea, London, says therapy doesn't have to be about your relationship with your mother. 'Take cognitive therapy,' he says, 'which is practical, here-and-now, goal-directed and problem-solving. Health insurance companies will even pay for it because its effectiveness is proven.' The overriding message from Dr Deenesh Khoosal, of the Brandon Mental Health Unit at Leicester General Hospital, is that most people suffering from stress-related disorders cure themselves - by talking to friends, thrashing it out on the squash court or taking a long walk.</p> <p><b> When to seek help</b></p> <p>While depression has very clear signs (see below), knowing when you are dangerously stressed is difficult because the symptoms are so diverse and the build-up to crisis is gradual. Often, it is other people who first notice that something is wrong. 'It's time to seek help when stress takes its toll physically or mentally,' says Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m.</p> <p>Martin Deahl says the best definition of work-related stress is: 'A feeling that you are having demands put on you which you can't meet. You're chasing your own tail, trying to do more and more in a shorter space of time, until you can't function.' The difficulty of self-diagnosis is compounded by the fact that stress is both healthy and necessary. 'There is something called the performance-anxiety curve,' says Martin Deahl, sketching a parabola in the air with his finger. 'As your stress levels go up, so your ability to perform tasks improves. You get to a certain point, then you go over the top of the curve and you go to pieces. The trick is to stay at the top of the curve.' Without stress - and the accompanying adrenaline rush - no athlete, concert pianist or executive would perform well.</p> <p><b>Steps to take before therapy</b></p> <p>If you believe you are seriously stressed, there are steps you can take on your own. The first, says Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m, is to remove yourself from the situation. 'Put your mobile phone away,' he says, 'lock up your laptop. Get a sick note from your GP and don't go to work.' If the symptoms persist, take a holiday and try to set your own limits regarding sensible, reasonable working hours. Pace yourself, says Hallstr\u00f6m, by taking regular weekend breaks. Above all, talk to your boss - and broach the subject early with your partner or spouse. 'Confiding relationships are the healthiest sort,' says Martin Deahl, 'and the most protective against mental illness.' If none of this works, there are two courses of action. One is to talk to your GP, who may work with counsellors who can advise you what to do next. The other is to approach your company's human resources manager or occupational health department. 'People are reluctant to do this,' says Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m, 'because they believe weakness will get them sacked. They also worry that, if they claim on their health insurance, everyone will find out. In my experience, neither of these is true.' Martin Deahl agrees that human resource departments should play a major role in dealing with stress at work. 'When employees hear the word psychiatrist,' he says, 'they run a mile. If the onus is placed on HR managers, people won't reject treatment.'</p> <p><b>General assessment</b></p> <p>Before approaching any kind of therapist, it is vital to have a proper general assessment by a qualified psychiatrist. He or she will refer you, in turn, to the branch of psychotherapy that seems most appropriate. The main reason for the assessment, however, is to check that you are stressed as opposed to clinically depressed. 'Most types of therapy won't work if you are depressed,' says Martin Deahl, 'because you can't see your way out of the blackness.' You may need antidepressants or sleeping pills to manage the immediate crisis. 'Medication can bring you to a point where therapy will work,' says Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m.</p> <p><b>Anxiety management</b></p> <p>This treatment is offered by Deenesh Khoosal at his Leicester clinic. The day I spoke to him, he had treated a stressed QC, an overworked schoolteacher and a housewife who had been physically abused. 'People are likely to have their own views about what will help,' he says, 'and it's important to take advantage of where that particular person is in their own self-therapy. They might believe in aromatherapy, or light rays, or ginseng. By continuing with those, they can be active participants in their own stress management.' It sounds like money for old rope - but there are other aspects to Dr Khoosal's programme. Self-help books, relaxation techniques and gentle exercise such as a 30-minute walk each day (which burns up the adrenaline caused by stress) can all help to relieve anxiety, and Dr Khoosal gives practical advice about dealing with the underlying cause - not getting on with people, being in debt... If this doesn't work, it is time for more intensive therapies.</p> <p><b>Cognitive-behavioural therapy</b></p> <p>When people talk about 'seeing a therapist', they usually mean an analytical therapist - who encourages you to talk about your childhood, your parents and your relationships. This is the most familiar kind of 'dynamic' psychotherapy, which focuses on the feelings we have for other people as a result of our past experiences. Many people find this idea embarrassing, and because the course of 'analysis' is open-ended - involving weekly or twice-weekly visits for months or years - it can be expensive. Responding to these objections, therapies have been developed that are more practical, immediate and more to do with thoughts than feelings. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common, focusing on ways of changing thought processes and behaviour patterns to solve specific problems. Cosmo Hallstr\u00f6m gives the example of an executive who is working so hard he is tense, irritable, rowing with his wife and hardly ever seeing his children. On the behavioural side, he will be taught how to set limits. 'One idea might be never to work beyond 6pm,' says Hallstr\u00f6m, 'or to make a pledge that weekends are for your family only. If that is too big a change, you might say, \"Try to get home early one night a week\" and build it up gradually from there.' The client and the therapist decide when, and over what period of time, these steps will be taken. 'If the client can't take a holiday now,' says Hallstr\u00f6m, 'you might say, \"Well, at least get the brochures now.\"' As the client raises objections, the therapist will challenge them and supply encouragement and support. The same process occurs on the cognitive side, where false beliefs are challenged. 'Somebody might believe that, if they don't work late, they will be sacked,' Hallstr\u00f6m explains. 'You might ask: \"Why do you think that? Has anyone said it to you? Do you know of anyone who has lost their job for that? Does anyone in the office work harder than you? Haven't you just been promoted?\"' If alcohol is the problem, clients might be asked to keep a drink diary. Homework may be given, and the emphasis is on doing rather than talking - hence CBT's popularity with men. Between six and 12 sessions of CBT is the norm, at \u00a335-\u00a355 each if you go private. Well-known behavioural psychologists may charge \u00a3100, but the cost will often be met by health insurance companies.</p> <p><b>Brief therapy</b></p> <p>Browsing the internet, you will come across hundreds of references to Brief Therapy. This American 'self-improvement' therapy - with its emphasis on group hugs, bonding and public soul-bearing - has nothing to do with the brief therapy practised in Britain. 'What we mean by it,' says Martin Deahl, 'is something shorter than traditional analytical therapy.' Until very recently, nothing existed between the short, sharp solution of CBT and a lifetime of analysis. Brief therapy is the compromise, using dynamic techniques (discussing past experiences and traumas) within a set framework of sessions, along with practical problem-solving. 'Patients want to talk about their childhood and their parents,' says Deahl, 'but in CBT that isn't allowed. This is the answer.' A common version of brief therapy is cognitive-analytical therapy (CAT), which combines elements from both disciplines.</p> <p><b>Counselling</b></p> <p>The main difference between counselling and therapy, says Martin Deahl, is that counselling is 'a sympathetic ear' while therapy 'is more about giving people solutions'. Though he approves of the strong counselling culture in Britain, he regards it as 'a professional surrogate for friendship' in a society where cohesion is lacking. Counselling is unstructured, undefined and can be practised by anyone. A few years ago, Martin Deahl reminds me, the comedian Bernard Manning became a member of the British Association of Counselling, specialising in race discrimination and sexual abuse. 'He did it deliberately to expose the system,' says Deahl.</p> <p><b>How to find a therapist</b></p> <p>'The only way to find a good psychotherapist,' says Deahl, 'is by personal recommendation, often by your GP. No string of post-nominal letters is a guarantee.' The following organisations can help. The three experts I spoke to are members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (020 7235 2351), qualified medical doctors who specialise in the mind. They are not always psychotherapists, but do offer treatment for various types of mental illness. Acting as a 'clearing house', they may refer you to a psychotherapist. Fact sheets, available from the RCP, explain psychotherapy. Cognitive-behavioural therapists are usually clinical psychologists, with a degree plus a further training in clinical psychology. The British Psychological Society (0116 254 9568) keeps a directory of 'chartered' psychologists at its website (www.bps.org.uk) and in public reference libraries. Still, anyone can practise as a 'psychologist'. A register of 4,500 psychotherapists is kept by the UK Council for Psychotherapy (020 7436 3002). The register is voluntary, not statutory, but all members are thought to have had acceptable levels of training. Again, anyone can practise as a 'psychotherapist'.</p> <p><b>Signs that you are stressed</b></p> <p>\u0095 Lying awake worrying about work \u0095 Talking excessively about problems at work \u0095 Never talking about problems at work \u0095 Working more but achieving less \u0095 Feeling irritable, miserable or anxious \u0095 Taking your mobile phone on holiday \u0095 Phoning the office while on holiday \u0095 Drinking more alcohol to feel relaxed</p> <p><b>Signs you may be clinically depressed</b></p> <p>\u0095 Avoiding things you usually do \u0095 A heavier step as you near the office \u0095 Waking up early and worrying \u0095 Loss of weight \u0095 Loss of libido \u0095 Loss of appetite \u0095 Women's periods stop \u0095 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, churning stomach, trembling, palpitations \u0095 Tension headaches, back pain, feeling you are wound up like a spring \u0095 Feelings of guilt and self-blame \u0095 Thoughts of suicide</p>",

They reported that the pirates emerged unsteadily into the sunlight. Some sang the 'Cup of Life' World Cup theme. Others cursed the Communist Party. 'We gave the men food and hard liquor to help take away the tension of being executed,' a police official told Hong Kong's South China Morning Post .</p> <p>The men had their arms lashed behind their backs and their hands and feet were chained. Numbers were attached with sticky tape to their chests. Yang Jingtao, aged 25 and convicted of murder and robbery, was said by eyewitnesses to lead the singing with shouts of 'Go, go, go, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9.'</p> <p>He then said sarcastically to reporters: 'I just want to thank the Communist Party's judicial system and my defending counsel for giving me a fair chance.'</p> <p>The scene was reminiscent of execution parades in pre-Communist China when criminals on their way to execution were expected to sing Chinese opera. If they expressed resolve to go fearlessly to their deaths, they would be applauded by the crowd. Those who could not sing properly were booed.</p> <p>Chinese executions are no longer conducted in public, but those facing death are still taken through the streets in open trucks. They are not normally permitted alcohol and are often manhandled by their guards. Executions are more frequent in the run-up to the Chinese new year as the authorities clear the decks of convicted criminals. The Year of the Dragon begins next Saturday.</p> <p>This execution was delayed because the conviction of a foreigner - Indonesian Wei Suoni - required endorsement by the Supreme Court in Beijing. Suoni smoked a last cigarette as he sat impassively in the truck.</p> <p>The gang boarded the Changsheng cargo ship on 16 November, posing as anti-smuggling police. They blindfolded the crew then beat them to death before throwing them in the sea. Their conviction last month was greeted with relief by Asian ship owners who have been alarmed by previous cases in which Chinese courts let suspected hijackers go free.</p> <p>The Supreme Court said in its judgment that China was determined to take stern action against ship pirates.</p> <p>China regards statistics on executions as a state secret and cases are reported individually, often only in the local press.</p> <p>Amnesty International compiled information on 2,701 death sentences in 1998 and 1,769 confirmed executions. Amnesty believes the real figure was much higher.</p> <p>Chinese authorities say the number of executions should decrease following a 1997 revision of the Criminal Law, but the lack of information makes this impossible to verify.</p> <p>The gang were paraded in court on Friday to hear the judge confirm the verdicts and announce that punishment must be 'executed without delay'. They proceeded immediately to their drinking session in the courtroom before being taken away.</p> <p>Executions are carried out in China in the open air, usually on waste ground in city suburbs. Those found guilty are shot, either by a firing squad or at close range with a bullet to the head.</p> <p>The 13 were convicted in a well-publicised trial which heard that the hijacked ship had been sold to an unknown foreign buyer for about \u00a3190,000 which was divided between the gang.</p> <p>They had previously robbed two ships in 1998 without committing any murders.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A gang of Chinese pirates have been sent to their deaths in a macabre parade, reeling with drink and singing Ricky Martin's 1998 World Cup theme song to show they were not afraid. The 12 Chinese and one Indonesian were executed on Friday in the southern city of Shanwei after being convicted of a horrific hijacking in which they bludgeoned to death the entire crew of a Hong Kong-based cargo ship. Before being put into open trucks outside the courthouse, they were allowed half an hour to meet relatives, with some food - and large quantities of rice wine. Hong Kong Chinese journalists had, unusually, been allowed to cover the trial. They reported that the pirates emerged unsteadily into the sunlight. Some sang the 'Cup of Life' World Cup theme. Others cursed the Communist Party. 'We gave the men food and hard liquor to help take away the tension of being executed,' a police official told Hong Kong's South China Morning Post . The men had their arms lashed behind their backs and their hands and feet were chained. Numbers were attached with sticky tape to their chests. Yang Jingtao, aged 25 and convicted of murder and robbery, was said by eyewitnesses to lead the singing with shouts of 'Go, go, go, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9.' He then said sarcastically to reporters: 'I just want to thank the Communist Party's judicial system and my defending counsel for giving me a fair chance.' The scene was reminiscent of execution parades in pre-Communist China when criminals on their way to execution were expected to sing Chinese opera. If they expressed resolve to go fearlessly to their deaths, they would be applauded by the crowd. Those who could not sing properly were booed. Chinese executions are no longer conducted in public, but those facing death are still taken through the streets in open trucks. They are not normally permitted alcohol and are often manhandled by their guards. Executions are more frequent in the run-up to the Chinese new year as the authorities clear the decks of convicted criminals. The Year of the Dragon begins next Saturday. This execution was delayed because the conviction of a foreigner - Indonesian Wei Suoni - required endorsement by the Supreme Court in Beijing. Suoni smoked a last cigarette as he sat impassively in the truck. The gang boarded the Changsheng cargo ship on 16 November, posing as anti-smuggling police. They blindfolded the crew then beat them to death before throwing them in the sea. Their conviction last month was greeted with relief by Asian ship owners who have been alarmed by previous cases in which Chinese courts let suspected hijackers go free. The Supreme Court said in its judgment that China was determined to take stern action against ship pirates. China regards statistics on executions as a state secret and cases are reported individually, often only in the local press. Amnesty International compiled information on 2,701 death sentences in 1998 and 1,769 confirmed executions. Amnesty believes the real figure was much higher. Chinese authorities say the number of executions should decrease following a 1997 revision of the Criminal Law, but the lack of information makes this impossible to verify. The gang were paraded in court on Friday to hear the judge confirm the verdicts and announce that punishment must be 'executed without delay'. They proceeded immediately to their drinking session in the courtroom before being taken away. Executions are carried out in China in the open air, usually on waste ground in city suburbs. Those found guilty are shot, either by a firing squad or at close range with a bullet to the head. The 13 were convicted in a well-publicised trial which heard that the hijacked ship had been sold to an unknown foreign buyer for about \u00a3190,000 which was divided between the gang. They had previously robbed two ships in 1998 without committing any murders.",

A strike in the Home Counties was simply the start. Where will it end? </p> <p>Connex, the French-owned operator of the south-eastern services (mostly South London, Kent, Surrey and Sussex) which were brought to a halt last week, is reviled by its passengers for poor service and had been infamous within the industry for its tough stance on industrial relations. </p> <p>The speed with which it gave in to the workers' demands has led many to declare that drivers union Aslef has more power now than it ever did in the days of British Rail. </p> <p>George Muir, director- general of the Association of Train Operators, said: 'Before privatisation, British Rail was a single, monolithic negotiating power that was backed by the Treasury. </p> <p>'Now you have private sector operators with narrow profit margins. It is a serious concern for the industry. Aslef is a very centralised, unified union, and is almost certainly stronger now than before privatisation.' </p> <p>As one train operator's executive put it, a rail strike used to be about politics - now it is about economics. </p> <p>Connex is estimated to have lost \u00a31 million in ticket revenues on each of its two franchises (South Eastern and South Central) as a result of Tuesday's action. It will not face performance penalties from the regulatory authorities because strike action is regarded as a force beyond its control. But it has been wounded. </p> <p>Almost more important than the loss of income was the need to maintain service at a time when it is trying to win a very beneficial extension to the south-central franchise against keen rivals. One executive from another operator said: 'I am surprised Connex has agreed quite so quickly because it has always taken a very aggressive stance. But Aslef has got all the cards, and it chose a time when Connex was weaker because it is trying to win the new contract. A week or two's strike could bankrupt an operator. Aslef has already done a deal with South West Trains, who realised they were on a hiding to nothing and rolled over straight away.' </p> <p>Drivers on Merseyside have already voted for strike action. And Virgin's train drivers, who earn a basic salary of around \u00a323,000, have requested a rise to \u00a335,000. Negotiations are under way. Connex drivers typically earn around \u00a326,000 basic and many make that up to between \u00a331,000 and \u00a335,000 with overtime. </p> <p>These are among the better paid drivers - they work the heavily used commuter networks and high-speed inter-city routes - but even an average driver's pay, with average overtime, puts them above typical teachers and nurses. </p> <p>An executive with one of Connex's rivals said: 'Next they will want a four-day week. If the drivers end up breaking a few companies, they have nothing to worry about: the Strategic Rail Authority would have to take over and they would be kept on to run the services. It takes between one and two years to train a driver, so managers cannot bust a strike by simply climbing into the cab.' </p> <p>One of the union demands conceded by Connex was to make 100 per cent of the driver's basic salary pensionable; compared with the current level of about 70 per cent. (The anomaly dates from BR days.) Aslef says the next item on its agenda is reducing the retirement age to 60. </p> <p>A senior industry consultant said: 'There will be further pressure, and drivers will end up being seriously better paid than they are today. But in many ways train drivers are underpaid. They work long hours in a stressful job where they have up to 800 people travelling behind them: a moment's loss of concentration can be catastrophic.' </p> <p>The number of train drivers in the UK dropped from 17,500 in 1995 to 14,000 by the end of 1998 as older, more experienced drivers took the one-off redundancy deals on offer during privatisation. At a time when passenger traffic has been growing at an annual rate of around 8 per cent, that has meant human resources being stretched to the limit - or, many would argue, beyond it. </p> <p>There has been a net rise in driver numbers of 600 in the past year, but Aslef estimates that a further 1,400 are needed nationwide to phase out the practices of working on rest days, working 11-hour shifts a dozen days in a row and other lucrative but exhausting practices that are common in the industry. The union points out that these undermine safety as well as drivers' private lives and health. </p> <p>The union's mission is to improve basic pay and conditions, and to recruit additional numbers. </p> <p>Aslef spokesman John Richards said: 'We do not aim to use industrial action as our negotiating tool; it is the final resort. But if companies are resisting meaningful negotiation we have to use the strike wherever and whenever it is necessary.' </p> <p>The Government will be relieved that the Connex confrontation has cooled, at least for the time being.

      "body": "<p>TONY pulls on his yellow cagoule, black hat and gloves and stands shivering in a gun-metal grey January dawn. It is 9.30am outside the Millennium Dome at Greenwich last Thursday, and the time has come to begin work.</p> <p>He pulls back the white plastic ropes that block the ticket booths and turns to greet his guests. But no one comes to the party.</p> <p>The only people scurrying out of the Tube station work at the Dome. They check their watches; they are late. Not that it matters much. Inside, at the Cappuccino Bar and American Bagel Bakery, glum-looking waiters and waitresses twiddle knobs on the pretzel maker, and stare at the deserted auditorium.</p> <p>'It's our quietest week yet,' says Julie, 23, who has been working at the Dome since it opened. 'And God knows what it will be like next week. Mondays are always the worst.'</p> <p>Tomorrow the Dome is one month old. Proud parents usually celebrate with a party, but none is planned. Instead, Tony will take his place outside the ticket booths and direct a few early arrivals through turnstiles. 'Mo, in number one, is twiddling her thumbs. Go to number one,' he tells a family of four just arrived by train from Derby. A party of Spanish tourists arrives. 'Please go along the line of booths. They are doing nothing there. The farther you go, the happier they will be to see you.'</p> <p>While Tony huddles against the cold, Dome bosses pore over computer print-outs in an overheated blue office next to the deserted coach park. Each person who walks through is logged and the numbers are collected. These figures are the Dome's most closely guarded secret. Everybody wants to know how many turn up each day but no one is telling.</p> <p>The reason? The Dome, built to re-energise the nation, raise the self-esteem of its people and enhance the nation's standing, is a flop. The New Millennium Experience, the company which runs the Dome, knows it. So do most of the underwhelmed visitors. But no one wants to admit the awkward truth that if things do not pick up Greenwich will turn out to be an \u00a3800 million white elephant - which could set back Tony Blair's plans for an early general election next spring.</p> <p>Ticket sales have failed to generate enough cash to pay staff next week and caterers have begun laying off workers. After two weeks of crisis talks with Ministers, Dome chiefs have cadged up to \u00a360m extra to make ends meet - with no compulsion to repay if the project runs into yet more trouble. The Millennium Commission, which has already given the Dome \u00a3444m, approved the bail-out. A spokesman said: 'We do not use the word loan because they do not absolutely have to pay it back. But we fully expect them to.

      "bodyText": "TONY pulls on his yellow cagoule, black hat and gloves and stands shivering in a gun-metal grey January dawn. It is 9.30am outside the Millennium Dome at Greenwich last Thursday, and the time has come to begin work. He pulls back the white plastic ropes that block the ticket booths and turns to greet his guests. But no one comes to the party. The only people scurrying out of the Tube station work at the Dome. They check their watches; they are late. Not that it matters much. Inside, at the Cappuccino Bar and American Bagel Bakery, glum-looking waiters and waitresses twiddle knobs on the pretzel maker, and stare at the deserted auditorium. 'It's our quietest week yet,' says Julie, 23, who has been working at the Dome since it opened. 'And God knows what it will be like next week. Mondays are always the worst.' Tomorrow the Dome is one month old. Proud parents usually celebrate with a party, but none is planned. Instead, Tony will take his place outside the ticket booths and direct a few early arrivals through turnstiles. 'Mo, in number one, is twiddling her thumbs. Go to number one,' he tells a family of four just arrived by train from Derby. A party of Spanish tourists arrives. 'Please go along the line of booths. They are doing nothing there. The farther you go, the happier they will be to see you.' While Tony huddles against the cold, Dome bosses pore over computer print-outs in an overheated blue office next to the deserted coach park. Each person who walks through is logged and the numbers are collected. These figures are the Dome's most closely guarded secret. Everybody wants to know how many turn up each day but no one is telling. The reason? The Dome, built to re-energise the nation, raise the self-esteem of its people and enhance the nation's standing, is a flop. The New Millennium Experience, the company which runs the Dome, knows it. So do most of the underwhelmed visitors. But no one wants to admit the awkward truth that if things do not pick up Greenwich will turn out to be an \u00a3800 million white elephant - which could set back Tony Blair's plans for an early general election next spring. Ticket sales have failed to generate enough cash to pay staff next week and caterers have begun laying off workers. After two weeks of crisis talks with Ministers, Dome chiefs have cadged up to \u00a360m extra to make ends meet - with no compulsion to repay if the project runs into yet more trouble. The Millennium Commission, which has already given the Dome \u00a3444m, approved the bail-out. A spokesman said: 'We do not use the word loan because they do not absolutely have to pay it back. But we fully expect them to. It is practically impossible to speculate on total disasters happening.' Some of the Dome's biggest supporters are beginning - privately - to reveal the story behind the fiasco. All say they were 'great supporters' of the project but blame arrogance, chronic bad planning and a lack of imagination for low visitor numbers. 'No one wanted to say it beforehand because we knew we would be branded killjoys but the odds on it being a disaster were always pretty high,' said one senior adviser. One official told The Observer : 'The Millennium Commission wanted a private company to run the show but no private company of any note made a credible bid. Almost two and a half years were wasted. It was not until December 1996 that the idea of a public sector company with a vastly reduced budget was accepted. Time was getting shorter and shorter and then the whole thing went into paralysis with the general election.' It took until three months after the 1997 election to persuade the new Labour Cabinet to press ahead with the scheme. 'By the time the real work started I think we all privately knew it was already too late. The game was up,' the source said. To makes matters worse, insiders say, the structures of Government held up decision-making. 'Because the project was a Government quango everything had to go up through various committees. It was painful.' Another former senior adviser accuses the New Millennium Experience of arrogance. 'They thought they could put on the biggest exhibition in Britain's history without involving people who really know what they are doing, people like Disney or Universal Studios. They thought they could do it all themselves. But they could not.' He revealed that on one occasion more than \u00a31m was wasted on a plan to install movable banks of seats in the central auditorium. The lack of a single big creative player also made it difficult to create a coherent structure or vision. 'You have to get the content right.

So is Tony. A local man - 'I live in Charlton' - he was delighted when he got the job. 'I am in my sixties. This is the last job I may have. It is tough when people have a go at us. We are all down. But it's January, it's cold, people are paying off their credit card bills. It will pick up when the weather gets better.' His job - and a \u00a360m loan - depends on it.",

Barring an accident with a Number 10 bus driven by Alastair Campbell, even Downing Street now expects Ken Livingstone to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of London. Who should Livingstone thank first in his acceptance speech? The answer - though both men would rather swallow a live newt than hear it - is Tony Blair.</p> <p>Rewind your memory for a moment. Spool back just a couple of years. The politician formerly known as Red Ken is a failure as an MP, a witty but powerless heckler of the New Labour juggernaut, a fiftysomething had-been from the Jurassic Eighties beached in the Blairite era. His judgement (he denounces giving independence to the Bank of England) proves to be as useless as his predictions (Gordon Brown will be such a calamity as Chancellor that Tony Blair will have to sack him). His alternative careers as a quiz show contestant and B-list celebrity face for TV commercials look brighter than his prospects as a politician. Now, fast forward just a few months and freeze-frame the scene that shivers the timbers of Number 10. Ken Livingstone is one of the most prominent players in the country, wielding a larger personal mandate than any other politician in Europe apart from the President of France. His attacks on the Government are more effective, more amusing and more destructive than anything emanating from William Hague. For that miraculous comeback, all thanks will be due to one man. Tony Blair has played unlikely Christ to Livingstone's even more unexpected Lazarus.</p> <p>There would be no Mayor of London at all were it not for the Prime Minister's determination to invent the office, despite opposition from most of his party, particularly prominent among the critics being one Ken Livingstone who only stopped describing the job as 'absolutely barmy' when he started running for it.</p> <p>That he is so much the favourite to win is also thanks to Number 10. New Labour: Stalinist control-freaks? Oh, please. What is starkly apparent is that these people are capable only of machine-gunning their own limbs. Tony Blair, who was forgiveably pre-occupied with Northern Ireland, Kosovo and a million and one other things that seemed more pressing, prevaricated for months about how to stop his b te rouge . Those employed to help the Prime Minister make up his mind quarrelled among themselves. While they waited for something to turn up, Livingstone cavorted across a clear field.</p> <p>The hare had sprinted miles ahead by the time faithful old Dobbo finally saddled up. It's unfair to say that Frank Dobson had his beard twisted until he agreed to run. Downing Street had given up on him when he suddenly announced he was entering the race. But it is one of the punishments for spin that, even when New Labour tells the truth, their own activists won't believe it. Frank Dobson started his campaign having to protest that he really did want the job and has spent most of the rest of his time attacking the party machine that has tried to gerrymander it for him.</p> <p>Livingstone owes an especially large debt to the knuckle-brains of Millbank who cast him as the unfairly treated under-dog. He developed his genius for the politics of victimhood during his reign at the Greater London Council. Livingstone's London is portrayed - especially by alumni like Paul Boateng and Margaret Hodge - as the most pestilential thing to have happened to the capital since the Black Death. It was not that. Nor was it the New Jerusalem now painted by Livingstone. His own memoir of his time as GLC leader candidly admits that his adminstration became the least popular in the capital's history. What transformed him from London's most loathed leader into the loveable Cockney Rebel was Margaret Thatcher's decision to abolish him. New Labour's terrible blunder was to allow him to pose again as the people's champion fighting clean against the dirty tricks of a dictatorial Downing Street.</p> <p>The fact is that there are few more cunning practioners of the politicial arts, including the dark ones, than Livingstone. He publicly denies smearing Frank Dobson as 'clinically depressed' - yet he used the phrase in a room containing at least a dozen journalists. It was cruel and low. It was also brilliantly effective. The decent, unglamorous Dobson has never really recovered from the notion of him as a Prozac-popping candidate for a strait-jacket.</p> <p>Livingstone is undoubtedly an original. I can think of no contemporary politician whose reputation among those who know him best is at such odds with his public persona. The punters see a charismatic, likeable wise-cracker. Colleagues describe an egotistical, manipulative opportunist. It is not just Blairites who fear and despise him. Brownites, Prescottians, and Blunkettites are united in their loathing of Livingstone. Bernie Grant - no New Labour lickspittle - says Ken is 'dodgy'. Brian Sedgemore - no one's idea of a Blairite toady - calls him a 'sad and lonely' man who will make London suffer for his own thwarted ambitions to lead Labour.</p> <p>He thrives on these attacks. Like one of his reptiles, cut off his tail and it grows back stronger. The more Tony Blair declares he will be a disaster, the better Livingstone does. He is not just the boot with which to give another overpowerful, under-opposed government a kick. It is a free kick. It is possible to vote Livingstone knowing that it will hurt the spin-merchants and control-freakists, but it won't hurt you. Tony Blair made it safe to vote Livingstone by giving the mayor such limited powers. Mayor Ken will tell good jokes, but he won't be able to jack up your taxes. The lack of powers was one of the main objections Mo Mowlam used with the Prime Minister when he unsuccessfully tried to shoehorn her into the contest.</p> <p>This is the straw at which Downing Street is grasping. I think I know how they will try to spin it. The slippery salamander will be constrained by the Labour manifesto. He'll be checked by the loyalist Labour members of the Lon don Assembly.

      "bodyText": "The Prime Minister's nightmayor is coming true. Barring an accident with a Number 10 bus driven by Alastair Campbell, even Downing Street now expects Ken Livingstone to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of London. Who should Livingstone thank first in his acceptance speech? The answer - though both men would rather swallow a live newt than hear it - is Tony Blair. Rewind your memory for a moment. Spool back just a couple of years. The politician formerly known as Red Ken is a failure as an MP, a witty but powerless heckler of the New Labour juggernaut, a fiftysomething had-been from the Jurassic Eighties beached in the Blairite era. His judgement (he denounces giving independence to the Bank of England) proves to be as useless as his predictions (Gordon Brown will be such a calamity as Chancellor that Tony Blair will have to sack him). His alternative careers as a quiz show contestant and B-list celebrity face for TV commercials look brighter than his prospects as a politician. Now, fast forward just a few months and freeze-frame the scene that shivers the timbers of Number 10. Ken Livingstone is one of the most prominent players in the country, wielding a larger personal mandate than any other politician in Europe apart from the President of France. His attacks on the Government are more effective, more amusing and more destructive than anything emanating from William Hague. For that miraculous comeback, all thanks will be due to one man. Tony Blair has played unlikely Christ to Livingstone's even more unexpected Lazarus. There would be no Mayor of London at all were it not for the Prime Minister's determination to invent the office, despite opposition from most of his party, particularly prominent among the critics being one Ken Livingstone who only stopped describing the job as 'absolutely barmy' when he started running for it. That he is so much the favourite to win is also thanks to Number 10. New Labour: Stalinist control-freaks? Oh, please. What is starkly apparent is that these people are capable only of machine-gunning their own limbs. Tony Blair, who was forgiveably pre-occupied with Northern Ireland, Kosovo and a million and one other things that seemed more pressing, prevaricated for months about how to stop his b te rouge . Those employed to help the Prime Minister make up his mind quarrelled among themselves. While they waited for something to turn up, Livingstone cavorted across a clear field. The hare had sprinted miles ahead by the time faithful old Dobbo finally saddled up. It's unfair to say that Frank Dobson had his beard twisted until he agreed to run. Downing Street had given up on him when he suddenly announced he was entering the race. But it is one of the punishments for spin that, even when New Labour tells the truth, their own activists won't believe it. Frank Dobson started his campaign having to protest that he really did want the job and has spent most of the rest of his time attacking the party machine that has tried to gerrymander it for him. Livingstone owes an especially large debt to the knuckle-brains of Millbank who cast him as the unfairly treated under-dog. He developed his genius for the politics of victimhood during his reign at the Greater London Council. Livingstone's London is portrayed - especially by alumni like Paul Boateng and Margaret Hodge - as the most pestilential thing to have happened to the capital since the Black Death. It was not that. Nor was it the New Jerusalem now painted by Livingstone. His own memoir of his time as GLC leader candidly admits that his adminstration became the least popular in the capital's history. What transformed him from London's most loathed leader into the loveable Cockney Rebel was Margaret Thatcher's decision to abolish him. New Labour's terrible blunder was to allow him to pose again as the people's champion fighting clean against the dirty tricks of a dictatorial Downing Street. The fact is that there are few more cunning practioners of the politicial arts, including the dark ones, than Livingstone. He publicly denies smearing Frank Dobson as 'clinically depressed' - yet he used the phrase in a room containing at least a dozen journalists. It was cruel and low. It was also brilliantly effective. The decent, unglamorous Dobson has never really recovered from the notion of him as a Prozac-popping candidate for a strait-jacket. Livingstone is undoubtedly an original. I can think of no contemporary politician whose reputation among those who know him best is at such odds with his public persona. The punters see a charismatic, likeable wise-cracker. Colleagues describe an egotistical, manipulative opportunist. It is not just Blairites who fear and despise him. Brownites, Prescottians, and Blunkettites are united in their loathing of Livingstone. Bernie Grant - no New Labour lickspittle - says Ken is 'dodgy'. Brian Sedgemore - no one's idea of a Blairite toady - calls him a 'sad and lonely' man who will make London suffer for his own thwarted ambitions to lead Labour. He thrives on these attacks. Like one of his reptiles, cut off his tail and it grows back stronger. The more Tony Blair declares he will be a disaster, the better Livingstone does. He is not just the boot with which to give another overpowerful, under-opposed government a kick. It is a free kick. It is possible to vote Livingstone knowing that it will hurt the spin-merchants and control-freakists, but it won't hurt you. Tony Blair made it safe to vote Livingstone by giving the mayor such limited powers. Mayor Ken will tell good jokes, but he won't be able to jack up your taxes. The lack of powers was one of the main objections Mo Mowlam used with the Prime Minister when he unsuccessfully tried to shoehorn her into the contest. This is the straw at which Downing Street is grasping. I think I know how they will try to spin it. The slippery salamander will be constrained by the Labour manifesto. He'll be checked by the loyalist Labour members of the Lon don Assembly. A Livingstone victory? Maybe, so they'll say, it won't mean that much, after all. But it will; it will matter a huge deal. To voters far beyond London it will demonstrate that the hearts and minds of his party do not belong to Tony Blair as exclusively as he likes to claim.

Are there happily married men who find that, when they turn to unlock the car, they are suddenly set upon by a squad of Islington-educated librarians and ruthlessly buggered against the family Mondeo?</p> <p>Well, maybe. There are many children who, in council-run homes or family bedrooms, have been horribly abused. But we have strong laws and intense social stigmas against child abuse and no one has suggested that the outpouring of anti-gay sentiment over the repeal of Section 28 has anything to do with that. Is it that gays have just got uppity of late, blowing whistles, kissing in public and getting their own TV shows?</p> <p>This is, perhaps, nearer to the mark. Numerous clerics seem to think the country faces a tide of homosexual propaganda and the ruthless 'promotion' of gay lifestyles. Again, despite being brought up in single-sex boarding schools, going to university at the high tide of Gay Lib and living with many gay friends in a city generally considered to be Sodom-on-Thames, I have to say that no one has suggested I'd look nice in a leather collar, offered me a popper or suggested a quick encounter not approved by the Chief Rabbi. Not once. Oh, well. Perhaps it's the sticky-out ears.</p> <p>You can find gay shops and clubs, bars and magazines. But they are hardly ubiquitous; nor are nervous heterosexuals frogmarched into them. It is true that society has become vastly more open about sex, to the point of tedium - a reaction to decades of repression and puritanism. But this seems to be declining. 'Sex sells' they used to say. Now, looking at the hoardings it seems we are rather sated. Today, irony sells faster. No. I am afraid that however hard one searches for an interesting reason for homophobia, it seems there isn't one. It is just fear, hatred and prejudice as usual.</p> <p>This tale starts when Mrs Thatcher, as she then was, complained at the 1987 Conservative conference that children 'are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay'. The inescapable conclusion, that they don't have a right to be gay, formed the basis of her party's Section 28 ban on councils promoting homosexuality. (Since people can't be talked into becoming homosexual, 'promoting' seems merely to mean 'talking about'.)</p> <p>Then, 12 years later, we have Cardinal Thomas Winning: 'It pains me to use the word perverted when discussing the homosexual act but that's what it is - I will not stand for this sort of behaviour.'</p> <p>He went on in a later speech in Malta to compare gay campaigners to the fascist threat in 1940: 'In the place of the bombs of 50 years ago you find yourselves bombarded with images and ideas which are utterly alien.' Winning later denied he meant to compare gays with Nazis, though quite what else he could have meant is unclear.</p> <p>The Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, at least noted that gays as well as Jews were sent to Auschwitz but lined up with the Section 28ers nevertheless, accusing Ministers of abdicating from their moral responsibilities. Muslim leaders piled in as well. For the Anglicans, James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool, said society should test the ethics of homosexuality by applying Kant's rule and asking what would happen if it were to be the law universal: 'If homosexual practice were to become such, the species would not be in a position to recreate itself.'</p> <p>This particularly bizarre argument suggests that we should judge any minority by asking what would happen if it was not merely the majority but the absolute rule. Thus, if pious celibacy was universal, we would also die out. So Jones wants young people warned off that as well? Far from it. 'Young people in our schools need to hear from single and celibate people, gay and straight, who live fulfilled lives without any sexual intercourse.' Cant, not Kant.</p> <p>Jones continued, 'physiologically, the genitalia are manifestly designed for the opposite, and not the same, gender; in the act of gay sex, there are serious health issues.' (Of course; but these words came in the same week that we learned heterosexuals now have a greater risk of becoming HIV infected than homosexuals.)</p> <p>These are a fair representation of the cross-section of major voices against repealing Clause 28. The religious leaders are lining up against liberal, secular society in their most sustained challenge for years, based on what Jones calls 'natural theology' - that homosexuality is against nature and hence perverted and immoral. However much Sacks, Winning and the rest say that they are in favour of tolerance, they know and we know that their campaign depends on emotion - specifically, disgust at the idea of buggery. Physical distaste is what underscores their morality, and makes it feel like 'common sense'.</p> <p>Certainly, there is no other rational excuse for the word 'unnatural'. There is ample documented evidence of homosexuality in the animal world, including in the monkeys genetically nearest to us; and in primitive human societies of all kinds. Most societies we know about had homosexual groups. The more evidence we accumulate, the more sure we are that sexual orientation is a given, wired into some people, and is not something that can either be eradicated or 'promoted' to the wider population. Intellectually, the argument is moving against what Sacks called 'the world's great religions' with decisive force.</p> <p>One day, we will just let people live their lives. So what about that instinctive reaction? For most of us, the precise physical details of other people's sex lives are something we don't think about. If for some odd reason you wanted to describe heterosexual sex in words that make it sound utterly repulsive, absurd, undignified, unclean, then you could do so very easily. The insistent focus on what some gay people do in bed some of the time I would call moral voyeurism, a willed summoning of images to reinforce disgust.</p> <p>And here comes the really hard test for Winning, Sacks and the rest. This physical disgust is the absolute staple of bigotry everywhere, including anti-Catholicism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Do you know, Cardinal, how protestant anti-Catholic bigotry feels? Do you understand the mixture of intellectual revulsion at your utter obedience to a man in Rome, and physical revulsion of the bells and smells, the look and sound of the mass and its priestly adherents? Are you aware that your chosen word to attack homosexuals, 'perverted', is also the favoured word of the Paisleys of this world against you and your kind? You are safe from this only thanks to the liberal toleration you now attack.</p> <p>Or think, Rabbi, of the images summoned up by Nazism to poison Gentiles against the Jews - the films of scurrying rats, the cameras homing in on flies resting on poor children's coats, the evil mental check-list - lank hair, funny clothes. How far away is all this harping on nature, uncleanness and the gay as alien, from all that? Liberalism is not a belief system, equivalent to Islam or Darwinism, but rather a way of coping with many beliefs. It demands restraint among very different groups, organised toleration and a reluctance to generalise. But it is a tough system, even so, for it rests on the conscious suppression of 'instinctive' reactions, unless there is an immediate threat to the public good.</p> <p>That threat has not been demonstrated over the repeal of Section 28. I might as well say that, since I find aspects of all the religions mentioned in this article both absurd and offensive, I want no 'promotion', or talking about, religion in front of my children. But like most liberals, I think that accurate information and understanding of others is always good, never bad.</p> <p>In their campaign against an unused but symbolic piece of legislation, a law which essentially says that gay people are lesser, all these leaders have offended not only homosexuals but also the liberal order which is everyone's main protection in a plural Britain. They are using their enemies' sword, arguing in ways which, if turned against their own lifestyles, they would find jaw-droppingly offensive. They are silly fools.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore waxes endlessly lyrical about how he was attracted to his wife's 'integrity' and 'compassion', but actually he first spotted Tipper across the dance floor at St Alban's prep school in Washington. He made his move. Understandably: she was a vision of blondeness and a dish. Tipper, likewise, says that what she fell for that night was her future husband's 'sense of purpose' - without specifying the purpose. In those days, Al was also quite a hunk.</p> <p>Within a matter of days, they were planning to spend the rest of their lives together and calculating how many children they would have. What is not so clear, however, is when Tipper and Al first discussed tenancy of the property at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, although they have certainly had their sights on the White House since 1989. Now, at last, that well-rehearsed moment is upon them, and the blonde on the dance floor is only two electoral steps away from becoming First Lady of the USA.</p> <p>Tipper's role in her husband's current and regenerated campaign is - deceptively, perhaps - every bit as interventionist as that of the woman she hopes to replace. While Hillary Clinton has played the role of Bill's defence lawyer - convincing the electorate he was a faithful husband - Tipper is Al Gore's character witness, determined to persuade America that he is a human being. She does not take questions.</p> <p>It is Tipper's job to talk about how Al picked up a harmonica to jam with his son's rock band that day. And to tell that story about how once _ Al found his son's band rehearsing and picked up a harmonica. We'll be hearing a lot about that harmonica. Tipper is also Al's sartorial adviser.</p> <p>Hillary was clipped and precise; Tipper rambles. Hillary was criticised for being 'Sister Frigidaire'; most people wish Tipper would turn down the gushometer by a degree or two. And Tipper sure can bake cookies. Indeed, Tipper's main job is to make it clear to America that she is not Hillary. That the Gores are not the Clintons - and how.</p> <p>So much so that many people wish some of the strenuously-denied libido that brought Al and Tipper together that magic night at the high-school dance had lasted into their nuptial life. Although Americans are exasperated by the grubby soap opera of the Clinton marriage, it had a certain voltage, an entertainment value unsuitable for prime-time viewing. The Gore marriage belongs more to a toothpaste commercial or to any Christian cable channel.</p> <p>One aide recalls how Gore used to take his sun lamp on the road while out campaigning. 'Girls all over the place were swooning, but he's very na\u00efve in that area. It almost makes you wonder how they got four children.' Instead, Tipper fixes their marriage in the heartland of middle American morality - where the church and family are central. 'I want America to know he's a very good father,' she gushes. In response Al fixes her with a melting gaze and slips his hand into one of hers. It will be safe to be an intern in thong underwear under a Gore administration - he'd never know.</p> <p>Indeed, Tipper Gore was markedly absent on the day Bill Clinton was impeached and leading Democrats turned out to throw a pep rally at which Al Gore called him 'one of our greatest Presidents'. 'I must have had something to do that day,' she says. 'I may have been with my kids or something.'</p> <p>Tipper Gore was born Mary Elizabeth Acheson in Arlington, Virginia, in August 1948.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore waxes endlessly lyrical about how he was attracted to his wife's 'integrity' and 'compassion', but actually he first spotted Tipper across the dance floor at St Alban's prep school in Washington. He made his move. Understandably: she was a vision of blondeness and a dish. Tipper, likewise, says that what she fell for that night was her future husband's 'sense of purpose' - without specifying the purpose. In those days, Al was also quite a hunk. Within a matter of days, they were planning to spend the rest of their lives together and calculating how many children they would have. What is not so clear, however, is when Tipper and Al first discussed tenancy of the property at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, although they have certainly had their sights on the White House since 1989. Now, at last, that well-rehearsed moment is upon them, and the blonde on the dance floor is only two electoral steps away from becoming First Lady of the USA. Tipper's role in her husband's current and regenerated campaign is - deceptively, perhaps - every bit as interventionist as that of the woman she hopes to replace. While Hillary Clinton has played the role of Bill's defence lawyer - convincing the electorate he was a faithful husband - Tipper is Al Gore's character witness, determined to persuade America that he is a human being. She does not take questions. It is Tipper's job to talk about how Al picked up a harmonica to jam with his son's rock band that day. And to tell that story about how once _ Al found his son's band rehearsing and picked up a harmonica. We'll be hearing a lot about that harmonica. Tipper is also Al's sartorial adviser. Hillary was clipped and precise; Tipper rambles. Hillary was criticised for being 'Sister Frigidaire'; most people wish Tipper would turn down the gushometer by a degree or two. And Tipper sure can bake cookies. Indeed, Tipper's main job is to make it clear to America that she is not Hillary. That the Gores are not the Clintons - and how. So much so that many people wish some of the strenuously-denied libido that brought Al and Tipper together that magic night at the high-school dance had lasted into their nuptial life. Although Americans are exasperated by the grubby soap opera of the Clinton marriage, it had a certain voltage, an entertainment value unsuitable for prime-time viewing. The Gore marriage belongs more to a toothpaste commercial or to any Christian cable channel. One aide recalls how Gore used to take his sun lamp on the road while out campaigning. 'Girls all over the place were swooning, but he's very na\u00efve in that area. It almost makes you wonder how they got four children.' Instead, Tipper fixes their marriage in the heartland of middle American morality - where the church and family are central. 'I want America to know he's a very good father,' she gushes. In response Al fixes her with a melting gaze and slips his hand into one of hers. It will be safe to be an intern in thong underwear under a Gore administration - he'd never know. Indeed, Tipper Gore was markedly absent on the day Bill Clinton was impeached and leading Democrats turned out to throw a pep rally at which Al Gore called him 'one of our greatest Presidents'. 'I must have had something to do that day,' she says. 'I may have been with my kids or something.' Tipper Gore was born Mary Elizabeth Acheson in Arlington, Virginia, in August 1948. While baby Al was groomed for power in Washington, Tipper was only child to Margaret Widom, a war widow and divorcee hospitalised twice with depression. Tipper says she had always wanted a large family. Widom lost her first husband in the Pacific campaign and married again to John Acheson in 1947. They divorced when their daughter was two, by which time she already had her nickname, from a lullaby, 'Tippy Tippy Tin'. Tipper was a lonely child, teased by classmates for 'having no father'.

      "body": "<b> America decides</b> <p> 'MARDI GRAS without the booze,' scowls H. A. Holt, a dealer in Stars and Stripes flags and regalia, beholding the first signs of what will soon be the roller-coaster of the United States presidential election. </p> <p>The first dice in the next phase of American politics will be thrown in New Hampshire on Tuesday. The event looks like street theatre performing in Holt's picture-postcard town, where the pretty white wooden buildings are wrapped in thick snow, and long, pointed icicles hang from the eves, catching the deep, tangerine winter sun. </p> <p>There is 'Pentagon Pork', a walking two-legged pig affiliated to Republican John McCain, illustrating wastage in military spending. The 'New Hampshire Cookie Mom' (real name, Sandra Rivera) hands out biscuits iced with a pie chart of the federal budget. Eight protesters are arrested at Al Gore's headquarters for drawing rowdy attention to the Vice-President's financial stake in Occidental Petroleum - a more serious episode hinting at things to come. </p> <p>But this is not theatre. In both camps, the political gloves are off and the fighting, man to man, begins: in primary elections, running is not a team sport. Beyond Tuesday's primary, Gore - a name that no longer starts with a 'B' - will lay siege to the White House, probably without effective challenge from within his own Democratic Party. Gore is stealing a march on his Democrat challenger, Bill Bradley, and closing in on his real rival, the Republican George W. Bush. </p> <p>New Hampshire is the beginning of Clintonism without Clinton. On Friday night in Nashua, Gore used the phrase 'Bill Clinton and I', after months during which he barely acknowledged having ever met the man. </p> <p>On the Republican side, Tuesday will bring the long-awaited high noon between the national favourite, Bush and the rebel McCain, veteran of the Hanoi Hilton. McCain leads the New Hampshire polls and may wound his rival this time, Bush will no doubt fire the final bullet. </p> <p>New Hampshire is a maverick, contrarian state (motto: 'Live free or die'), which has in the past chosen such early sprinters as Democrat Paul Tsongas and Republican Pat Robertson, and it comes naturally for it to be enamoured of McCain. </p> <p>But Tsongas and Robertson later sank without trace. With astonishing rapidity, this election is crystallising into a duel between the long-haul juggernauts with enough money and raw political muscle to see it though to the end, so the way should soon clear for Gore and Bush. </p> <p>Bush has had a curious week. Flush with the biggest-ever victory in a multi-candidate Republican field, in Iowa, he has faced hesitant audiences. The applause at the Merrimack Republicans' breakfast last Thursday was muted. The number of guests at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce the previous night was 100 less than expected. There was but a small, if enthusiastic, crowd to greet him as he climbed off his bus at Laconia in the foothills of White Mountain on Friday. </p> <p>Bush himself has been keeping the volume down, finding his voice slowly and putting his feet up, literally. On the bus arriving in Nashua, the soles of the Texas governor's shoes were squashed against a window. </p> <p>But there is a mercurial - even sinister - winning quality about Bush, something apparent in the flesh but not on television. He has mastered the tactile, sensuous art of campaigning - it is in his DNA. It is in the meeting of an eye, a handshake, the embrace of a stranger, the grip of a shoulder. He picks up every baby as though it were his own (McCain cannot do so because of his disabled arms; Gore would drop them). </p> <p>Bush writes his signature like a rock star.

      "bodyText": "America decides 'MARDI GRAS without the booze,' scowls H. A. Holt, a dealer in Stars and Stripes flags and regalia, beholding the first signs of what will soon be the roller-coaster of the United States presidential election. The first dice in the next phase of American politics will be thrown in New Hampshire on Tuesday. The event looks like street theatre performing in Holt's picture-postcard town, where the pretty white wooden buildings are wrapped in thick snow, and long, pointed icicles hang from the eves, catching the deep, tangerine winter sun. There is 'Pentagon Pork', a walking two-legged pig affiliated to Republican John McCain, illustrating wastage in military spending. The 'New Hampshire Cookie Mom' (real name, Sandra Rivera) hands out biscuits iced with a pie chart of the federal budget. Eight protesters are arrested at Al Gore's headquarters for drawing rowdy attention to the Vice-President's financial stake in Occidental Petroleum - a more serious episode hinting at things to come. But this is not theatre. In both camps, the political gloves are off and the fighting, man to man, begins: in primary elections, running is not a team sport. Beyond Tuesday's primary, Gore - a name that no longer starts with a 'B' - will lay siege to the White House, probably without effective challenge from within his own Democratic Party. Gore is stealing a march on his Democrat challenger, Bill Bradley, and closing in on his real rival, the Republican George W. Bush. New Hampshire is the beginning of Clintonism without Clinton. On Friday night in Nashua, Gore used the phrase 'Bill Clinton and I', after months during which he barely acknowledged having ever met the man. On the Republican side, Tuesday will bring the long-awaited high noon between the national favourite, Bush and the rebel McCain, veteran of the Hanoi Hilton. McCain leads the New Hampshire polls and may wound his rival this time, Bush will no doubt fire the final bullet. New Hampshire is a maverick, contrarian state (motto: 'Live free or die'), which has in the past chosen such early sprinters as Democrat Paul Tsongas and Republican Pat Robertson, and it comes naturally for it to be enamoured of McCain. But Tsongas and Robertson later sank without trace. With astonishing rapidity, this election is crystallising into a duel between the long-haul juggernauts with enough money and raw political muscle to see it though to the end, so the way should soon clear for Gore and Bush. Bush has had a curious week. Flush with the biggest-ever victory in a multi-candidate Republican field, in Iowa, he has faced hesitant audiences. The applause at the Merrimack Republicans' breakfast last Thursday was muted. The number of guests at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce the previous night was 100 less than expected. There was but a small, if enthusiastic, crowd to greet him as he climbed off his bus at Laconia in the foothills of White Mountain on Friday. Bush himself has been keeping the volume down, finding his voice slowly and putting his feet up, literally. On the bus arriving in Nashua, the soles of the Texas governor's shoes were squashed against a window. But there is a mercurial - even sinister - winning quality about Bush, something apparent in the flesh but not on television. He has mastered the tactile, sensuous art of campaigning - it is in his DNA. It is in the meeting of an eye, a handshake, the embrace of a stranger, the grip of a shoulder. He picks up every baby as though it were his own (McCain cannot do so because of his disabled arms; Gore would drop them). Bush writes his signature like a rock star. He does not have Clinton's brain or passion for epic politics, but he oozes the same chemistry. Watching Bush, you understand how, with quiet charisma, he convinced tycoons to back him before he started on the voters. Bush may lose to McCain on Tuesday, more narrowly than predicted, but it will not matter in the end. This juggernaut keeps its reserve tank for when the big votes come on the 'Super' and 'Southern' Tuesdays, in March. Bush is in reality someone else's candidate: that of the party machine and its money. There is so much cash - raised through brilliant manipulation of the system - that he can afford to forswear matching federal funds, thus freeing himself of all campaign spending limits. He hopes for the best in New Hampshire, but does not depend on it. McCain, who does, remains the best show on the road, in either party, and it is fun to hang out with. His White House would constitute a second, audacious American revolution. He has an almost cult, trans-ideological following; the man himself - a childish sage but hard as steel - is usually available to chat. His audience in the snowy town of Exeter on Friday was a mix of veterans in embroidered caps and shivering students. His banter was simultaneously light and severe. 'I've been up there to Dixville Notch twice, in pursuit of those 29 eligible voters,' cracked McCain. 'There are no depths to which I will not sink. I'm a Navy man.' He attacked Clinton's 'social work' foreign policy. More scarily, he talks about 'the system', and campaign finance reform. His own party is terrified of this man. This talk may win libertarian New Hampshire for McCain, but cannot win him America. There is also a complicating factor in New Hampshire: the separate conservative (as opposed to Republican) primary and the eye-popping, apocalyptic, pulpit rhetoric of Alan Keyes, which dominated the television debate and reduced a (very white) crowd of New Hampshire-ites to tears on Thursday night. Keyes, for a brief while, can take votes from everyone . His father, he explained, gave him his middle name, Lee - after the Confederate general - 'and as you may notice, I am black'.

      "bodyText": "Seas around Britain are rising at an accelerating rate, scientists have discovered - thanks to a book of measurements made by a Liverpool pirate over 200 years ago. The observations, made by Captain William Hutchinson between 1764 and 1793, reveal that the effects of global warming, due to emission of industrial gases, may be worse than estimated. Chunks of Britain's coastline face inundation; storm surges are likely to increase; low-lying areas of most UK cities risk being swamped; while beaches, wetlands and marshes face flooding. 'We already knew that sea levels are getting higher thanks to global warming, but these new figures show that the oceans are not just rising steadily but are doing so at an accelerating rate,' said Dr Edward Hill, director of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Bidston Hill, in the Wirral. 'Unfortunately, it is probably too late now to reverse this.' The discovery and subsequent analysis of the records of Captain Hutchinson have provided a new insight into the watery crisis into which the world is now plunging. Hutchinson was born in 1715 and rose from a common sailor to privateer captain. However, his strict religious views and abhorrence of swearing suggest he was not the most successful pirate, and it was not until he was employed as Liverpool's dockmaster that he really established himself as one of the city's historical heroes. Among Hutchinson's self-appointed tasks was the measuring of the high-tide mark at the city's Old Dock twice a day for almost 30 years. In providing the nation with its first set of systematic tidal measurements, he created a scientific legacy that provided modern scientists with crucial insight into oceans. 'In Britain measurements of sea levels were not started systematically until Victorian times, by which time factories and mines had been pouring out carbon dioxide, and other pollutants, for decades,' said Dr Philip Woodworth, who analysed Hutchinson's tide records.' These gases have slowly built up, causing the globe to heat up and the oceans to warm, and swell in volume. In addition, polar ice caps may have begun to melt - both phenomena resulting in recent rises in sea levels, about a millimetre a year. But sea level rises are difficult to calculate.

      "body": "<p>Iain, a lobster fisherman, chuckled over his single malt as he watched Dr Roger Stephenson walk down to the pier on the isolated Hebridean island of Harris - pursued by hordes of soggy journalists. </p> <p>'It's like a scene from Castaway Galore,' he guffawed, rocking his salt-flecked head back in his favourite fraying wicker chair in the Harris hotel. </p> <p>The 43-year-old was watching the latest chapter in the long-running real-life BBC farce, Castaway 2000 - the Dissenters' Cut. </p> <p>It will begin again tomorrow when the last of the castaways, who fled the small island of Taransay after New Year, brave the choppy Atlantic waters and rejoin the 30 people who are crammed into the island's only house. </p> <p> Castaway 2000 was supposed to be the ideal TV experiment - the docusoap to end all docusoaps. </p> <p>The idea was hatched over an egg and cress sandwich in the BBC canteen two years ago. It fitted perfectly with plans put forward by Peter Salmon, controller of BBC1, for 'significant' television to mark the millennium and was planned as a fascinating quasi-scientific look at the way we live. </p> <p>Take 30 people to a deserted, treeless island off the Scottish coast, tell them to form a community, leave a camera crew in their midst and let them get on with it. </p> <p>Film the arguments, the discussions, the efforts to cook and clean and mend the leaking roofs. </p> <p>And then make a series of programmes about it and watch the great ratings roll in. </p> <p>But yesterday's chaotic scenes - more reminiscent of Brigadoon than Local Hero - have left the BBC at the centre of an unscheduled \u00a32.4 million farce. </p> <p>The problems began just days after shooting started. Four of the castaways lost their entire belongings for the year during a bungled airlift and within days of arrival 18 of them abandoned the island for the comforts of the Harris hotel and have so far refused to return. </p> <p>Many families said they had quit because they were furious at the producers' failure to provide the facilities they expected. They had no homes, no toilets, no bedding, no cooking facilities and no heating. </p> <p>After fleeing the island, the castaways spent much of last week holed up in the white-washed Harris hotel - watching the first few episodes of the documentary on TV, as their lives became the focus of both the documentary and the nation's press. </p> <p>The Harris hotel is at the centre of Tarbert, a one-road village in the thrall of its new-found celebrity.

      "bodyText": "Iain, a lobster fisherman, chuckled over his single malt as he watched Dr Roger Stephenson walk down to the pier on the isolated Hebridean island of Harris - pursued by hordes of soggy journalists. 'It's like a scene from Castaway Galore,' he guffawed, rocking his salt-flecked head back in his favourite fraying wicker chair in the Harris hotel. The 43-year-old was watching the latest chapter in the long-running real-life BBC farce, Castaway 2000 - the Dissenters' Cut. It will begin again tomorrow when the last of the castaways, who fled the small island of Taransay after New Year, brave the choppy Atlantic waters and rejoin the 30 people who are crammed into the island's only house. Castaway 2000 was supposed to be the ideal TV experiment - the docusoap to end all docusoaps. The idea was hatched over an egg and cress sandwich in the BBC canteen two years ago. It fitted perfectly with plans put forward by Peter Salmon, controller of BBC1, for 'significant' television to mark the millennium and was planned as a fascinating quasi-scientific look at the way we live. Take 30 people to a deserted, treeless island off the Scottish coast, tell them to form a community, leave a camera crew in their midst and let them get on with it. Film the arguments, the discussions, the efforts to cook and clean and mend the leaking roofs. And then make a series of programmes about it and watch the great ratings roll in. But yesterday's chaotic scenes - more reminiscent of Brigadoon than Local Hero - have left the BBC at the centre of an unscheduled \u00a32.4 million farce. The problems began just days after shooting started. Four of the castaways lost their entire belongings for the year during a bungled airlift and within days of arrival 18 of them abandoned the island for the comforts of the Harris hotel and have so far refused to return. Many families said they had quit because they were furious at the producers' failure to provide the facilities they expected. They had no homes, no toilets, no bedding, no cooking facilities and no heating. After fleeing the island, the castaways spent much of last week holed up in the white-washed Harris hotel - watching the first few episodes of the documentary on TV, as their lives became the focus of both the documentary and the nation's press. The Harris hotel is at the centre of Tarbert, a one-road village in the thrall of its new-found celebrity. When journalists flocked there last week, they found the castaways three deep at the bar. Tarbert used to deal in fishing, icy winds and solitude: now it trades in hire cars, mass hotel bookings and showbiz gossip. One local fisherman said: 'I think Lion TV have handled the publicity of this excellently, they have you guys eating out of their hands. And besides, the isolated life here is nothing new to us: we just get a bit of money for a while taking journalists to the island.' The hotel has been churning out its staple dish of steak and chips at a furious rate for the past week as the Highland wind batters its slate-grey roof. Inside, Fleet Street's finest sit on edge as yet another rumour surfaces of an announcement from the castaways or crew. The corridors are cluttered with camera cases and photographers kneeling before laptops, sending pictures back to London. The one pay phone is constantly in use, the hotel phone the only point of contact for the dozen odd journalists here, for whom the hotel staff act as reluctant secretaries. Mobiles do not work on Harris. In fact, the past month has been one long flurry of television and print media. 'It's been a real pain,' said one hotel worker, 'we spend so long rushing around fetching people it's hard to get along with running the hotel.' Last Friday night the bar was packed as usual but with some newcomers. The band played, the carpet was soaked in lager, but few made a fuss about the arrivals. Eventually the excitement will die down, the castaway island will collapse or the series will simply run its course. As living conditions on Taransay improve, it is becoming harder for the locals to understand what interest lies in artificially recreating the kind of isolated environment they have always known on Harris, and which thousands have fled, but instead with townies and a few cameras. They dismiss the 'landmark observational documentary' as a waste of licence-payers' money. In the hotel bar, Dr Roger Stephenson, and his wife, Rosemary yesterday tried to explain why the volunteers had mutinied. At a press conference called to satisfy the media feeding frenzy the programme has created, Stephenson confirmed that there had been 'nowhere to live on the island'. The one house had been home to up to 16 builders, as the rush to finish the accommodation continued. The Stephensons want the house gutted, its walls and floors scrubbed, before taking their children back to live there. They also revealed that the intended sanitary system, using a small hole in the ground filled with compost, had not worked. 'The island's soil was not deep enough for the design,' said Stephenson. A new system should be introduced next week. With some of the worst weather the islands have seen for years expected in the next few weeks, the local feeling is that the project will be lucky to survive three months. But now the 'ecopods' - the environmentally friendly housing the castaways expected to be ready - are complete spirits have been raised. When they arrive back on Taransay tomorrow the Stephensons acknowledge they are unlikely to receive a warm welcome. They knew, they said yesterday, that the castaways who had chosen to stick out the squalor resented their decision to decamp to the hotel. Many castaways predict it will be hard to get along following last week's media frenzy.

      "bodyText": "Britain's veterinary clinics are being swept along in an unprecedented wave of alernative medicine, offering GM-free diets for dogs, laser acupuncture for cats, homeopathy for horses, chinese herbs for hamsters, and faith-healing for gerbils. Particular triumphs are said to include a rhino cured of eczma, and a parrot cured of depression. The number of vets offering some form of complimentary medicine - at up to \u00a3100 an hour - has rocketed to more than 250 in the last year. There is one vet clinic solely for alternative medicine, but two more are to open in coming months. Courses on veterinary acupuncture and holistic medicine have proliferated in the last year. However, the development is threatening to split the profession, with orthodox vets accusing their alternative peers of 'veterinary voodoo'. 'It's been growing across the board,' said Chrissie Nicholls of the British Veterinary Association. 'As complementary medicine moved out of the ranks of the cranks, it was inevitable people want it for their pets.' Charles Papapetrou, an acupuncturist, claims particular success with dogs, and has set up a weekly clinic at a veterinary surgery in affluent Hampstead in London, charging \u00a350 for 45 minutes. He says he helped cure a golden retriever's arthritis. 'The treatment gave him an extra year of life,' said Papapetrou. 'The dog was in a lot of pain and couldn't walk. But within a few days of treatment, he was out and about. It's an injustice the longer this is kept from pets. Owners go to acupuncturists, but pets are still pumped full of drugs.' Faith healing for pets is also on the rise, according to Roy Hutchison, of the National Federation of Spiritual Healers. 'Animals react to spiritual healing. Animals are more susceptible than humans to the finer energies,' he claimed. According to Hutchison, horses and cats respond particularly well to faith healing but it works on all types of creature. 'You can do it on any animal, insects or cells or even bacteria. We take negativity or poison out of bacteria,' he said.

      "bodyText": "PETER HAIN, the one time enfant terrible of South African apartheid, will this week make a poignant return to his homeland and his former school as the Foreign Office Minister for Africa, one of the most remarkable modern-day British transformations from rebel to dignitary. Hain left South Africa with his parents for political exile when he was 14 and rose to prominence in 1969 when his 'Stop the Tour' protests in Britain led to the disruption of a South African rugby tour and the eventual cancellation of a cricket tour planned for the following year. The Minister, who travels to South Africa this weekend on a five-day visit, will be spending his final night on Robben Island, the jail in which Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Behind his desk at the Foreign Office, Hain has hung a large colour poster given to him by Mandela in 1994 with the inscription 'Mandela for President'. Hain said yesterday he did not expect to meet many of the old advocates of apartheid: 'One of the remarkable aspects of modern-day South Africa is that it is very difficult to find anyone who says they agreed with apartheid or opposed people like me.' Hain was known throughout white South Africa as Hain the Pain. Many of the Ministers he will meet joined him on anti-apartheid demonstrations outside the Foreign Office in the Seventies. During his trip, he will also visit his old school, Pretoria Boys High, and address its assembly: 'It will be very moving. I was last there just before political exile as a 14-year-old wet-behind-the- ears schoolboy in shorts.' Hain will highlight the continuing illiteracy and poor educational standards found throughout Africa, pointing to figures showing African educational standards falling when all over the rest of the world they are rising. On Wednesday, in the first of two big speeches, he will urge the British investment community not to miss the boat, claiming the economic modernisation programme of Thabo Mbeki's government mirrors that of Tony Blair's and is now embedded in South African society. 'At no little cost to itself, the South African government has held back from trying to right the ills of apartheid overnight by going on an unsustainable spending spree'. He will argue that South Africa, which represents 27 per cent of Africa's entire GDP, is well placed to become the African powerhouse for new technology. He will also try to reassure British people about the level of violence in South Africa, saying it is largely confined to Johannesburg, but will add that Britain will nevertheless step up aid to the South African police and army. In a separate speech in Durban, Hain will describe South Africa and Nigeria - which has undergone a democratic transformation under President Obasanjo - as the two countries to lead Africa into a new era. Hain yesterday chastised some protectionist European countries, especially Greece and Italy, blocking a breakthrough trade agreement signed between South Africa and the EU last October. Both Athens and Rome are demanding South Africa drops the word Ouzo or Grappa from some of its exports. He said: 'There are far too many leaders around the world who enjoyed the privilege and basked in the sunlight of being photographed alongside Nelson Mandela, who are then not backing South Africa by granting an access to European trade and export opportunities to which it is entitled.' He will also demand the South African government do more to prosecute businessmen breaking UN sanctions in Angola against Unita, the rebel force led by Jonas Savimbi. Despite accusations that the British Government is arming the repressive regime in Zimbabwe, Hain will claim South African airstrips are still being used to send fuel and munitions to Unita.",

Bullied and abused by peers for being gay, he reached suicidal despair before finding the strength to stand up to his antagonists.</p> <p>'It was scary,' he says. 'But it was the point I decided that things just couldn't get any worse, that I had to do something.' He was 13.</p> <p>James' story - and hundreds like it across Britain's schools - are the human side of the arcane, distorted, highly politicised debate raging over an unused corner of local government legislation, the notorious Section 28.</p> <p>Opponents of Section 28, which bans 'promotion' of homosexuality in schools, say the climate created by the Conservative legislation has stopped schools acting swiftly to curb homophobic bullying.</p> <p>After James's suicide attempt, he started to report bullies to teachers, who were eventually forced to act. 'People would pass in the corridor, call me queer then slam me against the wall,' he says.</p> <p>Now 15, he says life is more manageable, though the fusillade of verbal abuse continues in his 1,500-strong comprehensive in Hertfordshire. 'There is a 13-year old who comes up to me and says \"Why don't you go away, we don't want queers in our school.\" Usually I walk away.' Jamie Rennie, a former secondary school teacher and head of Stonewall Youth, which campaigns on behalf of young gay men and lesbians, said:'We have a rising rate of suicides in young people attributable to the fact that these pupils do not get the support they need from their peer group, parents or teachers. It's time this changed.'</p> <p>To an outsider, the row over Section 28 seems bizarre. (The relevant page of the statute book is actually Section 2A of the 1986 Local Government Act, but is still dubbed Section 28 after the original Clause 28 inserted in the Bill by Dame Jill Knight.) It forbids local authorities from 'intentionally promoting homosexuality' and - more importantly - from 'teaching the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship in any state school.'</p> <p>So vague is the legislation - there is no legal definition of 'promote' - that not a single prosecution has occurred.</p> <p>But just as progressive forces rallied around a Stop Clause 28 banner in the Eighties - ironically strengthening the lesbian and gay movement hugely - conservatives are rallying around a Keep the Clause campaign today. The drafting of the original section, particularly the use of the term 'promote' means that repeal seems odd to many families, who worry teachers will try and 'convert' pupils to homosexuality. Although few teachers were ever interested in any kind of promotion, one way or the other, it makes the argument for repeal harder to make.</p> <p>Sophie Peterson, 32, an IT recruitment consultant from Woking, Surrey, is one of many making the argument for abandoning this emotive stumbling block.</p> <p>'The fundamental problem is this word promotion. It leads people down a blind alley and has stifled debate in schools so that homosexuality is not discussed at all.</p> <p>'The issue is information and access to information.</p> <p>'It took me quite a while to get used to it but being part of the lesbian community is a very positive thing in my life now. At school I did not realise I was a lesbian, it was only later in life when I saw women dancing and kissing together and I realised that was what I wanted and needed to do. There were no images at school or anywhere really. We had Martina Navratilova and that was about it.'</p> <p>Retired teacher Brian Roberts lives with his partner of 43 years in Frome, Somerset. 'This is about thousands of ordinary people living ordinary lives all over the country who are treated like second-class citizens. Nobody wants homosexuality promoted, the word should be understand.' The furore has exposed cracks in the Labour and Conservative parties.

      "bodyText": "LYING ON A hospital bed, his stomach just pumped empty of dozens of paracetamol tablets, James Pointing made a decision. Bullied and abused by peers for being gay, he reached suicidal despair before finding the strength to stand up to his antagonists. 'It was scary,' he says. 'But it was the point I decided that things just couldn't get any worse, that I had to do something.' He was 13. James' story - and hundreds like it across Britain's schools - are the human side of the arcane, distorted, highly politicised debate raging over an unused corner of local government legislation, the notorious Section 28. Opponents of Section 28, which bans 'promotion' of homosexuality in schools, say the climate created by the Conservative legislation has stopped schools acting swiftly to curb homophobic bullying. After James's suicide attempt, he started to report bullies to teachers, who were eventually forced to act. 'People would pass in the corridor, call me queer then slam me against the wall,' he says. Now 15, he says life is more manageable, though the fusillade of verbal abuse continues in his 1,500-strong comprehensive in Hertfordshire. 'There is a 13-year old who comes up to me and says \"Why don't you go away, we don't want queers in our school.\" Usually I walk away.' Jamie Rennie, a former secondary school teacher and head of Stonewall Youth, which campaigns on behalf of young gay men and lesbians, said:'We have a rising rate of suicides in young people attributable to the fact that these pupils do not get the support they need from their peer group, parents or teachers. It's time this changed.' To an outsider, the row over Section 28 seems bizarre. (The relevant page of the statute book is actually Section 2A of the 1986 Local Government Act, but is still dubbed Section 28 after the original Clause 28 inserted in the Bill by Dame Jill Knight.) It forbids local authorities from 'intentionally promoting homosexuality' and - more importantly - from 'teaching the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship in any state school.' So vague is the legislation - there is no legal definition of 'promote' - that not a single prosecution has occurred. But just as progressive forces rallied around a Stop Clause 28 banner in the Eighties - ironically strengthening the lesbian and gay movement hugely - conservatives are rallying around a Keep the Clause campaign today. The drafting of the original section, particularly the use of the term 'promote' means that repeal seems odd to many families, who worry teachers will try and 'convert' pupils to homosexuality. Although few teachers were ever interested in any kind of promotion, one way or the other, it makes the argument for repeal harder to make. Sophie Peterson, 32, an IT recruitment consultant from Woking, Surrey, is one of many making the argument for abandoning this emotive stumbling block. 'The fundamental problem is this word promotion. It leads people down a blind alley and has stifled debate in schools so that homosexuality is not discussed at all. 'The issue is information and access to information. 'It took me quite a while to get used to it but being part of the lesbian community is a very positive thing in my life now. At school I did not realise I was a lesbian, it was only later in life when I saw women dancing and kissing together and I realised that was what I wanted and needed to do. There were no images at school or anywhere really. We had Martina Navratilova and that was about it.' Retired teacher Brian Roberts lives with his partner of 43 years in Frome, Somerset. 'This is about thousands of ordinary people living ordinary lives all over the country who are treated like second-class citizens. Nobody wants homosexuality promoted, the word should be understand.' The furore has exposed cracks in the Labour and Conservative parties. Throw in an increasingly conservative and united religious voice, Scottish pride at leading the charge for 'family values', businessmen throwing cash at an anti-gay crusade, and the historically poisonous relationship between central and local government, and you have a heady brew indeed. Angela Mason, director of gay rights group Stonewall, said: 'Section 28 was always political. Mrs Thatcher hated local authorities, painting them as loony left. The Poll Tax was one of her weapons - Section 28 was another. It was about politics, not sexuality.' Stoked by tabloid hysteria, the Conservatives pushed it through, probably knowing it was so badly drafted that no cases would stand up. The Daily Mail told the world that the Inner London Education Authority, a particular b\u00eate noire for Thatcherites, was spending money on a book entitled Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin ('A loving, down to earth portrayal of one kind of family' said the Guardian ) starring a gay couple with improbably flared trousers and a daughter. The fact that ILEA had one copy of the book, on the shelves of the Teachers' Resource Centre, didn't stop the storm. So the Clause become law, the Sunday Times lamenting at the time that Section 28 was a 'throwback to a more intolerant age, with no place in the new Britain.' After introduction of the Act, there was a threefold increase in queer bashing, according to helplines, and the offices of Capital Gay newspaper were burnt down. Gay rights campaigners also blame the clause, dubbed a 'bigot's charter', for allowing bullying in schools. Four in five schools admitted in a survey that homophobic taunts were rife, while a Stonewall survey last year found that of 1,000 gay men and lesbians, three out of four were bullied at school. Half of lesbians and gay men aged under 18 have experienced at least one violent attack, in or out of school, in the last five years. Only one in twenty schools have a policy on dealing with homophobic bullying. The explosion over the issue started in Scotland, where Brian Souter, bus magnate, poured half a million pounds into a Keep the Clause campaign. Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of Scotland's 750,000 Roman Catholics, weighed in too. In Edinburgh, the Blue Moon Cafe has become an unwilling focus for debate. Owner Clark, a victim of homophobic school bullies himself, is scathing about the hold that the Church of Scotland has achieved. 'We have a group of gay and lesbian Christians who meet here on a Sunday night because they have been thrown out of the church,' he said. 'The key is to educate the parents. I suppose if you can reach the children, that is the best hope for the future.' Scotland's parliament has been leading the House of Commons on the issue, while Edinburgh City Council has launched a scheme to monitor homophobic incidents in schools - with terms such as 'poof', 'lezzie' or 'faggot' landing perpetrators in trouble. Wiltshire, a typical conservative county, is unlikely to support repeal, says education committee chair Carole Soden. Life-long teacher and school governor Meg Breckon, of Lostwithiel, Cornwall, believes teachers should follow their instincts. 'There has been very little debate here because I don't think there has ever been promotion of homosexuality. Perhaps some strange things go on in London . . . but it is not really an issue here.' The Archbishop of Canterbury expressed concern, followed by Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who warned repeal would undermine morality. The Moslem Council of Britain, whose Secretary General is Iqbal Sacranie, brandished the Koran at the proposed repeal (and grabbed rare space in the Mail for its views) and Om Parkash Sharma, president of the National Council of Hindu Temples, who decried 'unnatural' gay activities. The outrage reflects the increasingly conservatism of organised religion. But Winning and others saw their chance, when it seemed the Government might budge. Afraid of upsetting religious leaders, and 'middle Britain', Blunkett's department began saying repeal would have zero impact, since guidelines on schools would promote 'marriage and traditional family life.' A senior Church of England source said this was the result of lobbying by religious leaders. 'The deal that is being done . . . is that we won't go to the wire over Section 28, in exchange for greater clarity over the guidelines.' This worries children's groups, who worked with the Government on balanced guidelines. They are bemused by Blair's spokesman saying parents could opt out of classes in personal and social development that cover sexuality. Gill Frances, of the National Children's Bureau, said: 'We have to prepare children with the world as it is today, not in the Fifties.' While the battle over the Bill rages, youngsters like James Pointing try to change attitudes one friend at a time. 'The thing that hurts most is to have lost friends because I am gay,' he says.",

      "body": "<p>TEEN TANTRUMS hit most families, prompting calls of 'act your age' followed by fiery replies of 'you just don't understand'. Cue slammed doors, parental sighs, mutual mystification.</p> <p>Now scientists have come up with an explanation for the erratic behaviour of adolescents: their brains are too big.</p> <p>Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have overturned the previous assumption that brains were fully developed by early childhood. Brain scans show a sudden surge in grey matter growth between the ages of 10 and 12, followed by a shrinking that can continue into the early twenties.</p> <p>Soon kitchens may echo to the new refrain: 'It's not my fault, my frontal and parietal lobes are still developing.' The California scientists - whose findings are backed by a separate Canadian study - say that these two lobes are the last to finish developing, with the long period of shrinking through the teens indicating a maturing process as unnecessary cells are weeded out and neural pathways cleared.</p> <p>'We were totally unprepared for what we found,' Jay Giedd, from the US National Institute of Mental Health, told New Scientist magazine. 'We were trying to make the result go away, wondering what we had done wrong. But we couldn't. The result stands.'</p> <p>The research, which tracked brain development through childhood, found that lower-level brain functions at the bottom and back of the brain - dealing with things like seeing and hearing - are complete by early childhood. But the parts that manage 'visuo-spatial' ability, planning and 'self-control' are still being perfected well into the college years.</p> <p>Advocates of a more understanding approach to teenagers were delighted with the new findings. Suzie Hayman, agony aunt for Woman's Own and author of You Just Don't Listen , a guide for parents of adolescents, said parents would have to learn to bite their tongue next time their teenager dropped a glass or crashed their car.</p> <p>'One of the most common examples is to have a go at them for clumsiness. For those of us who have argued for a long time that it is not the teenager's fault, that they are just like that, this research is very good news.</p> <p>'As an adult you can reach out to pick something up, you know where it is. Teenagers just can't do it in the same way. They can't help it.'</p> <p>The research also provides some counterweight to the current Government obsession with 'idle youths', and may help to explain increasing pressure on young people trying to cope with information overload along with a multibillion pound advertising offensive specifically targeted at them and early sexual activity.</p> <p>Suicide rates among young men are rising; a third of teenagers are suffering from depression; 12 per cent of young people will be reported by a school or other authority for delinquency.</p> <p>While the research backs the 'I can't help it' school of thought, the downside for teenagers is that the findings make it harder for them to argue that they are fully grown and able to make decisions just like adults.</p> <p>Developmental psychologists such as Barry Bogin at the University of Michigan argue that adolescence is a period of learning social skills, and that the brain may be in the process of 'hard wiring' behaviour patterns into the brain.</p> <p>Hayman said there was a danger that overzealous parents would use the fact that their teenager's grey cells are still developing as an excuse for 'hot housing', in the same way that some parents obsessively show flashcards to toddlers in the hope of turning out an Einstein.</p> <p>'I can see that some parents might get into the hot housing thing for their teenagers,' she said.</p> <p>What are currently seen as distractions from homework, such as Playstations and watching junk TV, might be seen as cementing slothful behaviour into youthful cortexes. Mandatory Dostoevsky could be the future of adolescence.</p> <p>'But the truth is that it's no use forcing them into doing something, because they won't,' said Hayman. 'In any case, the real problem for most teenagers is that they are bored out of their minds. They do need more stimulation - and more opportunities.'</p> <p>One of the reasons why adolescence is becoming so difficult, she said, is the failure of adults to give teenagers more responsibility. The new knowledge that adolescent brains are still developing should increase the desire to give them activities to get stuck into, rather than be turned into an excuse to ridicule them further.</p> <p>'If it is the case that social skills and organisation and so on are still being developed, then we should encourage more responsibility. One 15-year-old said to me that the only thing he was responsible for was his pencil.</p> <p>'Instead of just giving pocket money we should give them budgets for certain items, and let them manage it.</p> <p>'Many problems in adulthood stem from adolescence, when people were made to feel dreamy, useless, clumsy, or unreliable.'</p> <p>richard.reeves@observer.co.uk</p>",

      "bodyText": "TEEN TANTRUMS hit most families, prompting calls of 'act your age' followed by fiery replies of 'you just don't understand'. Cue slammed doors, parental sighs, mutual mystification. Now scientists have come up with an explanation for the erratic behaviour of adolescents: their brains are too big. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have overturned the previous assumption that brains were fully developed by early childhood. Brain scans show a sudden surge in grey matter growth between the ages of 10 and 12, followed by a shrinking that can continue into the early twenties. Soon kitchens may echo to the new refrain: 'It's not my fault, my frontal and parietal lobes are still developing.' The California scientists - whose findings are backed by a separate Canadian study - say that these two lobes are the last to finish developing, with the long period of shrinking through the teens indicating a maturing process as unnecessary cells are weeded out and neural pathways cleared. 'We were totally unprepared for what we found,' Jay Giedd, from the US National Institute of Mental Health, told New Scientist magazine. 'We were trying to make the result go away, wondering what we had done wrong. But we couldn't. The result stands.' The research, which tracked brain development through childhood, found that lower-level brain functions at the bottom and back of the brain - dealing with things like seeing and hearing - are complete by early childhood. But the parts that manage 'visuo-spatial' ability, planning and 'self-control' are still being perfected well into the college years. Advocates of a more understanding approach to teenagers were delighted with the new findings. Suzie Hayman, agony aunt for Woman's Own and author of You Just Don't Listen , a guide for parents of adolescents, said parents would have to learn to bite their tongue next time their teenager dropped a glass or crashed their car. 'One of the most common examples is to have a go at them for clumsiness. For those of us who have argued for a long time that it is not the teenager's fault, that they are just like that, this research is very good news. 'As an adult you can reach out to pick something up, you know where it is. Teenagers just can't do it in the same way. They can't help it.' The research also provides some counterweight to the current Government obsession with 'idle youths', and may help to explain increasing pressure on young people trying to cope with information overload along with a multibillion pound advertising offensive specifically targeted at them and early sexual activity. Suicide rates among young men are rising; a third of teenagers are suffering from depression; 12 per cent of young people will be reported by a school or other authority for delinquency. While the research backs the 'I can't help it' school of thought, the downside for teenagers is that the findings make it harder for them to argue that they are fully grown and able to make decisions just like adults. Developmental psychologists such as Barry Bogin at the University of Michigan argue that adolescence is a period of learning social skills, and that the brain may be in the process of 'hard wiring' behaviour patterns into the brain. Hayman said there was a danger that overzealous parents would use the fact that their teenager's grey cells are still developing as an excuse for 'hot housing', in the same way that some parents obsessively show flashcards to toddlers in the hope of turning out an Einstein. 'I can see that some parents might get into the hot housing thing for their teenagers,' she said. What are currently seen as distractions from homework, such as Playstations and watching junk TV, might be seen as cementing slothful behaviour into youthful cortexes. Mandatory Dostoevsky could be the future of adolescence. 'But the truth is that it's no use forcing them into doing something, because they won't,' said Hayman. 'In any case, the real problem for most teenagers is that they are bored out of their minds. They do need more stimulation - and more opportunities.' One of the reasons why adolescence is becoming so difficult, she said, is the failure of adults to give teenagers more responsibility. The new knowledge that adolescent brains are still developing should increase the desire to give them activities to get stuck into, rather than be turned into an excuse to ridicule them further. 'If it is the case that social skills and organisation and so on are still being developed, then we should encourage more responsibility. One 15-year-old said to me that the only thing he was responsible for was his pencil. 'Instead of just giving pocket money we should give them budgets for certain items, and let them manage it. 'Many problems in adulthood stem from adolescence, when people were made to feel dreamy, useless, clumsy, or unreliable.' richard.reeves@observer.co.uk",

She's sitting in a shambles of a front room in South Kensington, littered with power tools and pop-up tents and brand new billion-inch tellies, the detriti of too many builders and children and too much money.</p> <p>She's tetchy, the children are getting raw and tearful, and her eyes show the weariness of any mother of five. But seeing this woman out of high-flying mode is like seeing any other woman slumped in front of Family Fortunes in a tatty robe with a box of Black Magic, a bottle of Diamond White and 20 Superkings to hand.</p> <p>And - not that she would be so cynical - if the environment is meant to make her seem more human, it has the desired effect. As does she, when she catches herself laughing at something despite herself; as does little Antonia when she clambers between us, throws her pyjama-clad arms around my neck and gives me a huge wet kiss.</p> <p>By rights I should loathe Nicola Horlick. The writer Alexander Cockburn once advised, 'Never dilute the purity of your hatred,' and it's a tenet that has kept plenty of bitter hacks in good malicious stead since. And Horlick, on paper, seems awful. She was, you could argue, the first Thatcherite.</p> <p>A colleague who was an Oxford contemporary remembers her well from the very start of the Eighties: stridently purposeful, announcing proudly just how far she was going to go and precisely how she was going to do it. Soon, of course, everyone was at it, and the yuppie was born. But she was one of the very first. And she did make it, in the classic Eighties way, by making money out of money. By being a City high-flier through the years when industry was deliberately collapsed, Scotland and the North forced into penury and the nation's shared assets were stripped and sold and squandered - and the City made a killing out of all of it.</p> <p>And Horlick, through the Eighties and Nineties, sat at or near the top throughout, controlled and controlling, using whatever levers were available - including, rather cynically, feminism when, after being (rightly) sacked from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for planning to lead a group of defectors to a rival, she led a media posse into the building to complain that she'd been sacked because she was a woman. That was when she first hit the headlines, as the Woman Who Had It All, the modern post-feminist who Proved It Could Be Done - massive wealth, a loving husband, five children and fame. She was, declared women's magazines who had been chasing this grail, the Master Juggler.</p> <p>Except that she didn't, as we now know, have it all. As she knew herself, when she wrote her book, Can You Have It All? to which the conclusion was a stark 'no'.</p> <p>It's a little over a year since Georgie died, at Great Ormond Street hospital, a few weeks beyond her twelfth birthday. Nicola's eldest daughter fought lymphoblastic leukaemia for more than nine years, but eventually needed a bone-marrow transplant and, weakened by the accompanying treatment needed to get her into another remission, picked up a fungal infection of the lung and never recovered.</p> <p>Nicola talks willingly about the cancer, 'because I don't see why we aren't meant to talk about it. I really admire the work done by writers such as John Diamond and Ruth Picardie. I don't think cancer should be taboo.</p> <p>'Georgie, for instance, used to be stared at because of her [lack of] hair, which she hated, because all she ever wanted to be was like other people, and she never could. Now, some of the stares were compassionate, but some people just . . . gawked. Which I hated.'</p> <p>Georgie and cancer and Nicola's worki for Great Ormond Street are why she will be in the Barbican in London this afternoon, with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and noted conductor Chris Gayford - her brother - for a performance of Mozart's Thirty-Ninth. It is the first in a series of concerts this year designed to raise money for the hospital, which, Nicola notes proudly, 'now has a success rate of 90 per cent. Georgie, you see, was unlucky. But I want, I really want it to be 100 per cent. And I feel I'm able to help, and lucky to be in that position. I wondered whether I'd be as keen to work for charity after Georgie died, but I've wanted to work even harder.'</p> <p>Talk of rich people and society moves us on to her work. Did she realise, I wondered, that, while being revered by some as the epitome of having-it-all, she was reviled by others as the er-Thatcherite, as the biggest, greediest female fat cat of them all?</p> <p>'Actually, I'm not a Tory. The Tories always seem to assume I will naturally be a Conservative. But I never have been. The only time I've been involved, leafleting and the rest, was with my father, who was a Liberal. Dad used to hate the right-wing.'</p> <p>Did she inherit that dislike? 'No, not really. I really am completely apolitical.' Ahh . . . I get it. A Blairite, then.</p> <p>'And no, I don't feel like a parasite. I do think it was a mistake to let the manufacturing base of this country contract.

      "bodyText": "'SUPERWOMAN' has laddered her tights, metaphorically speaking. She is perfectly dressed, of course, but she's tired. She's sitting in a shambles of a front room in South Kensington, littered with power tools and pop-up tents and brand new billion-inch tellies, the detriti of too many builders and children and too much money. She's tetchy, the children are getting raw and tearful, and her eyes show the weariness of any mother of five. But seeing this woman out of high-flying mode is like seeing any other woman slumped in front of Family Fortunes in a tatty robe with a box of Black Magic, a bottle of Diamond White and 20 Superkings to hand. And - not that she would be so cynical - if the environment is meant to make her seem more human, it has the desired effect. As does she, when she catches herself laughing at something despite herself; as does little Antonia when she clambers between us, throws her pyjama-clad arms around my neck and gives me a huge wet kiss. By rights I should loathe Nicola Horlick. The writer Alexander Cockburn once advised, 'Never dilute the purity of your hatred,' and it's a tenet that has kept plenty of bitter hacks in good malicious stead since. And Horlick, on paper, seems awful. She was, you could argue, the first Thatcherite. A colleague who was an Oxford contemporary remembers her well from the very start of the Eighties: stridently purposeful, announcing proudly just how far she was going to go and precisely how she was going to do it. Soon, of course, everyone was at it, and the yuppie was born. But she was one of the very first. And she did make it, in the classic Eighties way, by making money out of money. By being a City high-flier through the years when industry was deliberately collapsed, Scotland and the North forced into penury and the nation's shared assets were stripped and sold and squandered - and the City made a killing out of all of it. And Horlick, through the Eighties and Nineties, sat at or near the top throughout, controlled and controlling, using whatever levers were available - including, rather cynically, feminism when, after being (rightly) sacked from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for planning to lead a group of defectors to a rival, she led a media posse into the building to complain that she'd been sacked because she was a woman. That was when she first hit the headlines, as the Woman Who Had It All, the modern post-feminist who Proved It Could Be Done - massive wealth, a loving husband, five children and fame. She was, declared women's magazines who had been chasing this grail, the Master Juggler. Except that she didn't, as we now know, have it all. As she knew herself, when she wrote her book, Can You Have It All? to which the conclusion was a stark 'no'. It's a little over a year since Georgie died, at Great Ormond Street hospital, a few weeks beyond her twelfth birthday. Nicola's eldest daughter fought lymphoblastic leukaemia for more than nine years, but eventually needed a bone-marrow transplant and, weakened by the accompanying treatment needed to get her into another remission, picked up a fungal infection of the lung and never recovered. Nicola talks willingly about the cancer, 'because I don't see why we aren't meant to talk about it. I really admire the work done by writers such as John Diamond and Ruth Picardie. I don't think cancer should be taboo. 'Georgie, for instance, used to be stared at because of her [lack of] hair, which she hated, because all she ever wanted to be was like other people, and she never could. Now, some of the stares were compassionate, but some people just . . . gawked. Which I hated.' Georgie and cancer and Nicola's worki for Great Ormond Street are why she will be in the Barbican in London this afternoon, with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and noted conductor Chris Gayford - her brother - for a performance of Mozart's Thirty-Ninth. It is the first in a series of concerts this year designed to raise money for the hospital, which, Nicola notes proudly, 'now has a success rate of 90 per cent. Georgie, you see, was unlucky. But I want, I really want it to be 100 per cent. And I feel I'm able to help, and lucky to be in that position. I wondered whether I'd be as keen to work for charity after Georgie died, but I've wanted to work even harder.' Talk of rich people and society moves us on to her work. Did she realise, I wondered, that, while being revered by some as the epitome of having-it-all, she was reviled by others as the er-Thatcherite, as the biggest, greediest female fat cat of them all? 'Actually, I'm not a Tory. The Tories always seem to assume I will naturally be a Conservative. But I never have been. The only time I've been involved, leafleting and the rest, was with my father, who was a Liberal. Dad used to hate the right-wing.' Did she inherit that dislike? 'No, not really. I really am completely apolitical.' Ahh . . . I get it. A Blairite, then. 'And no, I don't feel like a parasite. I do think it was a mistake to let the manufacturing base of this country contract. But even though I'm not actually making anything, I'm helping to take the burden off the state. The City makes a huge amount of money for the nation. Money for better roads, better hospitals. And don't forget that the money in the stock market is not just for rich people. The vast majority of the money [I deal with] is in occupational pension schemes; looking after it for ordinary people.' She denies that she's a control-freak. But she is organised, driven, controlled - last year, despite (or perhaps because of) Georgie's death, she threw herself so hard into work that her new company, SG Asset Management, was named the best performer in the City - and she must wonder what it was that kicked it all off. ' I did go to school in America for a while, and I was impressed, hugely, by that sense of can-do. All I really can remember wanting to do was make the world a better place.' Had she? 'No, not really. But I'm just one person.' And hard, cold, controlled? 'Actually, I've always been a pretty sentimental person.Particularly when it comes to music.' We talk for a while about the instruments the children are learning, and about her own most-loved music - Britten, Vaughan Williams - and her brother's musical work with children, and she talks with softness and passion and humanity, and all the other adjectives which didn't come into any of our conversations about money. And she talks, again, about Georgie. 'Other people tend to think . . . well, that was last year's story. Not for us. We talk about Georgie all the time.' Today, at the concert, there will again be five children. Nicola fell pregnant on her thirty-eighth birthday, one month after Georgie's death. Baby Ben is 20 weeks old.

Each had been shot in the head with a shotgun at point-blank range, leaving their faces so badly pulped they could be identified only by their fingerprints. All three were well-known Essex 'faces': Tucker ran security for pubs and clubs, including Raquels, where the Ecstasy tablet that killed Leah Betts had been obtained a month before the murder.

As Whomes and Steele realised Nicholls was becoming a weak link, they insisted he got more involved or faced the consequences. A few days after a particularly nasty threat, the gang were arrested by a police and customs drugs operation. Nicholls was charged with murder and knew the only way out was to tell the truth.</p> <p>'When I was giving evidence in the trial, I couldn't look at them in the dock.

The question that hangs over the deal is whether voters will view it as a mature piece of political haggling which improves the lot of some students, or a fudge which fails to cut charges from higher education. As Jim Wallace gets up from his desk, he is still talking about how good the deal is, sounding utterly convinced. Wallace has seen his party survive the novelty of coalition and negotiate the most significant piece of devolved legislation. It is Wallace gets the credit for creating the first significant policy difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Next time he bumps into Donald Dewar in the corridor, he might be the one to offer words of encouragement to the embattled Labour leader.",

      "body": "<p>We need a new England. The old one is no good. It is made up of half-remembered war stories, imperial guilt, disappeared green acres and the cringe, snobbery and xenophobia left behind from the glory days like a scummy chemical residue. The old England is the England whose nationalism makes liberals flinch. It is a fake, mis-remembered place, the Home Counties without the North, the Royals but not the radicals, the imperialism but not the passionate non-conformism. That England has lost the faith and now stands by, watching the Scots do their thing and the damned continentals do theirs. For the real English, the people of today's country, it has got in the way.</p> <p>To see the new England - a far more vigorous place, incidentally, than New England - you can start with the tale of two cities. These cities are, at first sight, entirely unalike, though they are both in London, no more than a few hundred yards apart. The first city is centred on Brick Lane, the heart of a warren of ancient streets which have been irrigated, generation after generation, by different waves of arrivals. The earliest buildings include houses and churches put up by the French Protestant Huguenots, fleeing Catholic persecution. After them have come Russian and Polish Jews, Bengalis, Somalis, Bangladeshis. As one group comes in, previous ones have tended to move on, leaving only a few inscriptions, or bagel shops behind them. So the Huguenot church became a synagogue and the synagogue became a mosque.</p> <p>Within a few hundred yards, you can journey from the old East End, with jellied eel and whelk stalls, elderly men in Fifties-style suits, junk shops stacked with shellac records and moist, moulded furniture, to the London of the 2000s, with hyper-trendy clothes stores, cutting-edge new Asian restaurants, fashionable cafes and walls covered with Indian film posters. On busy days, the air is full of American, French and Asian voices. The massive old Truman Brewery, in the middle of Brick Lane, has been bought by an Iraqi who is turning it into a set of media, film, PR, design and arts spaces, the businesses of modern London. Is it British? Is it English? The people there think so.</p> <p>One local businessman is Mukheem Ahmed, who owns, among other things, the Caf\u00e9 Naz, which has a Conran style to it and specialises in new wave Indian food. He was in Brick Lane with his wife and five-year-old daughter when the nail bomb attack happened last April. His wife was knocked over and his daughter had nightmares for weeks but, remarkably, he said the incident had made him feel more secure and more British.</p> <p>'The wider reaction really pleased me immensely. I received a lot of letters from customers and friends. We had the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, here, and William Hague here as well ... you know, the British people are all united together, and we are also British, and it made us feel good.' He personally is a different kind of person by living here: 'In physics terms, if the iron is with the magnet, it gets some of the properties of the magnet... you get infused by the surroundings and it leaves prominent marks on your personality.' He uses English and British interchangeably. He made a point of saying that, unlike the earlier generation of Bangladeshis who were sent home for burial, he would like to be buried in England.</p> <p>Brick Lane can stand for one part of the new England, the luck of post-colonialism, well caught by Dr Dass, singer for the Asian Dub Foundation: 'We say we're only here because you were there. All these communities come back to the so-called mother country and I would say that's the only good outcome of colonialism. I now have an opportunity to mix with people and cultures thousands of miles removed from where I might have been, which is India.' Is he English? Yes, partly he says, he's English. English, West Bengali and Hindu.</p> <p>The end of the empire has left us as an abnormally internationalist place with a web of overseas links, the world's prime language and a rich mix of people. Of course, as Brick Lane knows, there have been regular inundations of incomers, many of them political, ethnic or religious refugees, throughout English history. But the postwar story, from the day in June 1948 when a crammed old troopship, the Empire Windrush, arrived at Tilbury docks on the Thames with what the press called 'the 400 sons of Empire' to today, when the 'visible minorities' make up nearly six per cent of the population of England and account for some three million people, is different in size and impact.</p> <p>This poses tough questions about values: how does England balance the demands of Islam, so vivid during the Salman Rushdie fatwa affair, with the rights of secular people to criticise religion? How do the English persuade more of the best people in the Asian and Chinese communities to stay, rather than going to the US or (as many of the richest, most dynamic Hong Kong Chinese did) to Australia and Canada? All experience suggests that, over time, today's new English will slowly mingle with the old English, but the rate of intermarriage is still tiny; for the foreseeable future, we are talking about different communities with different instincts. How do we acknowledge them while maintaining a culture of individual rights and of free speech? How many of the new refugees, economic or political, should England take? Would it be fairer and better for this country to operate an open, above-board quota system, which assessed how many people from different backgrounds we could find space and education for, and let in a certain number each year? But if so, how can that be reconciled with our duties under asylum agreements?</p> <p>The second city is the City itself, the humming zone of global finance jammed right up next to Brick Lane. Its square mile-plus of glass-plate offices, marble reception areas, taxi-crammed streets, wine bars and pubs, carved from the flattened ruins of post-Blitz London, is home to no fewer than 555 foreign banks, more than any other city in the world.</p> <p>Of the 300,000 City workers who struggle in each morning by tube, bus, car and bicycle, more than 40 per cent work for foreign companies and many of the dealers, managers and lawyers themselves are American, German, Japanese and French. The London foreign exchange market is the largest in the world, with a daily turnover of $637 billion, a third of the world's total and more than twice as much as New York. London is the world's largest financial management centre, too, with $2.2 trillion under management. The London Stock Exchange is the world's largest centre for trading foreign equities, taking 63 per cent of the business in 1998. More foreign companies are quoted there than in any other stock exchange.</p> <p>Britain comes fourth in the league table of the world's biggest traders, behind the US, Japan and Germany, with 6.6 per cent of the total of world exports. When it comes to invisible trade, we are third, ahead of Germany, with 9.7 per cent. Foreign investment in the UK has grown from a little over \u00a310 billion in 1979 to \u00a3415bn in 1997, but UK investments overseas in the same period have grown from \u00a312.6bn to \u00a3574 billion, giving a net asset growth from \u00a32.2bn then to about \u00a3160bn now. These are mere figures but they represent an intertwining of economies with profound cultural and political consequences.</p> <p>This globalism infects everything that matters about the wealth and economic future of the country - the deadly moral dances in Whitehall over arms sales and international mergers; competition policy; the arm-wrestling inside the EU over deregulation of German banks and French nationalised industries; wage bargaining, the limits of taxation, monetary policy.</p> <p>This City's roots are in the colonial history of the country, from the merchant banking of the early British empire, the early development of the joint-stock company and the new forms of money-raising forced upon monarchs and parliaments by expansionary wars. Its results are not always benign for democracy: the super-earning City undermines traditional notions of fairness, injecting a plaintive note into any discussions about money in the ordinary economy; it exaggerates regional differences and it increases the hold that London has on the rest of the country. No great change is simply good or simply bad. But without London's world reach and international connections, England would be in a far grimmer economic condition.</p> <p>The two internationalisms of Brick Lane and the City are physically close. Imaginatively, they seem worlds apart - the city of the poor and the city of the rich. Yet the truth is that migration and the global economy are between them creating a new England. I have used 'England' here, not Britain, because without a self-confident and self-aware England, Britishness is doomed.</p> <p>And these two cities, the City city and the migrants' city, are colonising the English story, eating the old compact, dour, white nation away from within. The neighbouring cities may look different and smell different. They are certainly differently rewarded. But they are, in the end, part of a single great event, the penetration of these islands, the British islands which the English dominate, by world-sized powers.</p> <p>The financial City stands for the global culture that is inside the products that are inside our houses. As the designer Stephen Bayley put it, of the new Ford Ka: 'It is manufactured in Spain by an American corporation using components sourced from Basildon, Belfast, Bridgend, Dagenham, Enfield, Halewood, Leamington, Treforest, Berlin, Cologne, Saarlouis, Wulfrath, Genk, Bordeaux and Valencia. It was designed in Essex and Cologne by a team of individuals sourced from more than 20 different countries.'</p> <p>Beyond Ka, it can be found in the Net, which abolishes censorship and distance and has brought a humming throng of Americans, French, Swedes, Africans and South Americans into London to create new businesses. It can be found in the internationalisation of football, or the 'Brit art' market or the growth of what you could call the 'Atlantican' culture of US-style coffee bars, American-British star authors, TV programmes, American clothing. And in football, art, the Net, service industries of all kinds, the 'new English' of immigrant stock have been playing a vigorous and growing role. Yes, of course the 'migrant City' represented by Brick Lane in this fable has many dark corners - England's Bangladeshis are still one of the UK's poorest communities, young black men have appalling unemployment problems. But other groups of new British have been fantastically successful.</p> <p>The political implications of this new England are frankly awesome. It challenges the old social democratic dream. A tight, white, compact population which does not move very far is both readier to pay higher taxes to help 'people like us' and is also easier to tax than is a mobile, diverse population. If England's new diversity means England is becoming more like the US melting pot, then we may find America's tougher, more callous attitudes to welfare come here too. A more porous England is one that is also, unavoidably, more open to drugs, crime and tensions between communities. It won't be a fluffy multicultural playgroup of a country. It will be less stable.</p> <p>But, on the other hand, it will probably be more tolerant, less deferential and more successful. England's links to the rest of the world are now far stronger than at any time in her history. That means, too, that the Conservative anti-European crusade, the fantasy of a return to a self-contained Forties island people, is utterly doomed. English home rule, the return of English political identity, looks far less malign or threatening than it used to. The xenophobic, small-minded England is dying off, just as surely as the empire went.</p> <p>So there is an English revolution in progress, whose scale and speed eludes us only because we are living through it. The centre-left has no choice but to go with this business and cultural revolution, to exploit the liberal mood it brings and to try to ameliorate the erosion of social solidarity it also seems to mean. But there is one final thing. The new England needs new stories. She needs to remember large parts of her history and literature she has forgotten - the radicals, the cruder, ruder writers, the progressives and the internationalists - and dwell less on war, monarchy and rural fantasies. A new England is waking up. She needs a new memory.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Marr's The Day Britain Died will be shown on BBC2 tomorrow at 11.20pm, continuing on Tuesday and Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "We need a new England. The old one is no good. It is made up of half-remembered war stories, imperial guilt, disappeared green acres and the cringe, snobbery and xenophobia left behind from the glory days like a scummy chemical residue. The old England is the England whose nationalism makes liberals flinch. It is a fake, mis-remembered place, the Home Counties without the North, the Royals but not the radicals, the imperialism but not the passionate non-conformism. That England has lost the faith and now stands by, watching the Scots do their thing and the damned continentals do theirs. For the real English, the people of today's country, it has got in the way. To see the new England - a far more vigorous place, incidentally, than New England - you can start with the tale of two cities. These cities are, at first sight, entirely unalike, though they are both in London, no more than a few hundred yards apart. The first city is centred on Brick Lane, the heart of a warren of ancient streets which have been irrigated, generation after generation, by different waves of arrivals. The earliest buildings include houses and churches put up by the French Protestant Huguenots, fleeing Catholic persecution. After them have come Russian and Polish Jews, Bengalis, Somalis, Bangladeshis. As one group comes in, previous ones have tended to move on, leaving only a few inscriptions, or bagel shops behind them. So the Huguenot church became a synagogue and the synagogue became a mosque. Within a few hundred yards, you can journey from the old East End, with jellied eel and whelk stalls, elderly men in Fifties-style suits, junk shops stacked with shellac records and moist, moulded furniture, to the London of the 2000s, with hyper-trendy clothes stores, cutting-edge new Asian restaurants, fashionable cafes and walls covered with Indian film posters. On busy days, the air is full of American, French and Asian voices. The massive old Truman Brewery, in the middle of Brick Lane, has been bought by an Iraqi who is turning it into a set of media, film, PR, design and arts spaces, the businesses of modern London. Is it British? Is it English? The people there think so. One local businessman is Mukheem Ahmed, who owns, among other things, the Caf\u00e9 Naz, which has a Conran style to it and specialises in new wave Indian food. He was in Brick Lane with his wife and five-year-old daughter when the nail bomb attack happened last April. His wife was knocked over and his daughter had nightmares for weeks but, remarkably, he said the incident had made him feel more secure and more British. 'The wider reaction really pleased me immensely. I received a lot of letters from customers and friends. We had the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, here, and William Hague here as well ... you know, the British people are all united together, and we are also British, and it made us feel good.' He personally is a different kind of person by living here: 'In physics terms, if the iron is with the magnet, it gets some of the properties of the magnet... you get infused by the surroundings and it leaves prominent marks on your personality.' He uses English and British interchangeably. He made a point of saying that, unlike the earlier generation of Bangladeshis who were sent home for burial, he would like to be buried in England. Brick Lane can stand for one part of the new England, the luck of post-colonialism, well caught by Dr Dass, singer for the Asian Dub Foundation: 'We say we're only here because you were there. All these communities come back to the so-called mother country and I would say that's the only good outcome of colonialism. I now have an opportunity to mix with people and cultures thousands of miles removed from where I might have been, which is India.' Is he English? Yes, partly he says, he's English. English, West Bengali and Hindu. The end of the empire has left us as an abnormally internationalist place with a web of overseas links, the world's prime language and a rich mix of people. Of course, as Brick Lane knows, there have been regular inundations of incomers, many of them political, ethnic or religious refugees, throughout English history.

How do the English persuade more of the best people in the Asian and Chinese communities to stay, rather than going to the US or (as many of the richest, most dynamic Hong Kong Chinese did) to Australia and Canada? All experience suggests that, over time, today's new English will slowly mingle with the old English, but the rate of intermarriage is still tiny; for the foreseeable future, we are talking about different communities with different instincts.

      "body": "<p>Fat babies are less prone to depression in later life. This is good news. I conduct a mini survey, subject my youngest son's triple-tiered chin to scrutiny. Babies who listen to Mozart may turn out more intelligent. Must take note. Retune radio. Baby boys whose mothers suffered the baby blues (blue is, after all, for boys) might end up with lower IQs than the sons of mothers who have always been cheerful. Try to think back: there were bad days. How bad? Not bad enough, I think, to cause brain damage. So far, so promising. Deodorants may reduce male fertility. Fine by me. No threat (no sweat either).</p> <p>The latest research shows ... Studies suggest ... A new survey highlights ... As often as not, research is reported with no mention of its provenance. But even when we learn that findings are the result of a 'Social Trends' survey or from US NICHD, an American 'early childcare network', or the work of researchers from Harvard, we are not much the wiser.</p> <p>How the research was conducted is seldom explained. And the material itself is often remodelled like Plasticine to make a good story. To know what to believe, we would need to have been breathing down the researchers' necks ourselves, or at least to have been enlightened about their methods. So why bother to read about research at all?</p> <p>Research can be recreational. I read surveys as I might a zany horoscope, trying to fit it to my life. Some of it seems outlandish as astrology, some of it the work of a pedestrian Cassandra. I read with self-interested discrimination, ignoring what I don't want to hear, dwelling on what I do. I like this: 'Mothers who work on newspapers are twice as likely as fathers to be given more responsibility in their jobs, without this being reflected in a higher salary.' I am less taken with last week's research about young men reluctant to leave home. Apparently, one third of young men between the ages of 20 and 35 still live with their parents. I do a quick calculation. I am 42. My youngest son is one. I am never going to be free again.</p> <p>Research can be demoralising. It can be like one of those trick pictures: hold it this way and you see a beautiful curvy woman with a beckoning smile. Blink. Who is that frightening old hag who has taken her place? It can hit a nerve. Take last Monday's Panorama programme on working mothers. This was a kitchen-sink drama that will have made some women look back in anger, others look forward with fear. Panorama commissioned its 'own research' into working women and analysed 560 working mothers.</p> <p>It was discovered that, within two years, more than a third of them had given up full-time work. Seventeen per cent had become part-time workers and 19 per cent had given up work altogether. The scale of defection was on the increase and the reason for the exodus was inflexible employers with family-unfriendly policies.</p> <p>That was one piece of research. Another scrap hurled into Panorama's unpleasantly bubbling stew was the finding that mothers who work could impair their children's academic prowess. A study (of uncertain origin) to be published this Spring will explain that the children of full-time working mothers are likely to do worst at school and are less likely to achieve A-levels than other children. And it is not just educational deprivation that is on the agenda. Another survey a few months ago reported: 'Children who have less time in the care of their mothers during their first three years of life have less warm and positive relationships with them.'</p> <p>But other research last year (commissioned by Harriet Harman from the Institute of Education) flips the coin over. It found that the experience of childcare could be positive as long as it began after a child's first birthday. The children of working mothers might do better in maths and be less aggressive than those with mothers at home. A further study last year suggested that working mothers make the best managers. Being a mother, the theory goes, is an education in management. These women's lives may resemble overflowing suitcases. But they know how to fit everything in and sit on the lid.</p> <p>Working fathers can also read about themselves with interest. Research last year showed that the rise of the 10-hour working day may reduce a father's time with his children to 15 minutes a day. Another earlier study claimed that even a 'five-minute chat' with Dad every day gives children a 'far greater chance of becoming confident adults'. What should we conclude? Dads can spend 10 of their 15 minutes ignoring their children, as long as the kids get that quality five minutes?</p> <p>And then there is divorce: A rise in deaths from drink-related diseases is linked to Britain's divorce rate ... Children are unaffected by the emotional trauma of divorce if their parents split up before they are five ... Children of divorced parents are twice as likely to experience psychological, economic and social problems in adolescence and adulthood ... Children of divorced parents are 50 per cent less likely to end their own marriage in divorce than in 1973.</p> <p>What is the purpose behind research of this kind? Is there an evangelical intention? Is the idea that parents will be less inclined to part after considering the more negative of these findings? I have been puzzling, too, about the point of the research about boys becoming dimmer as a result of their Mum's postnatal depression. If true, of what use is it? It might make a mother guiltier. It couldn't make a boy brighter.</p> <p>And yet we remain obsessed with research. We live in a peculiarly rudderless society where we are not short of individual opinions but curiously unable to act on them.</p> <p>Companies cannot move without research - it is a sort of dragnet that can prevent bold, confident thinking. And we expect to hear about our personal lives through studies of the lives of strangers. We look at research as into a distorting mirror. The impulse is not straightforwardly narcissistic because what we see is not always flattering. Perhaps all we want is to have our opinions given an official stamp of approval, to have hopeful suspicions confirmed and fears allayed. Perhaps we want the companionship of knowing we fit into a general picture.</p> <p>But all research, I think, should be approached with caution. I have only to recall being on the receiving end of a market researcher's attentions last year to reinforce this view.</p> <p>She came to see me, ostensibly to find out my views about London buses. It was like taking a most puzzling exam. Her route to knowledge was longer, more circuitous and much more tedious than crossing town on the number 19 bus. Most of her questions seemed to have little to do with transport and many I found impossible to answer. Keen to oblige, I'd take a pot shot at questions I could not handle. In retrospect, I can think of only one good thing about the woman: her interest was in buses and not in my children.</p> <p>Incidentally, new research suggests that people who spend too long reading surveys become ...

      "bodyText": "Fat babies are less prone to depression in later life. This is good news. I conduct a mini survey, subject my youngest son's triple-tiered chin to scrutiny. Babies who listen to Mozart may turn out more intelligent. Must take note. Retune radio. Baby boys whose mothers suffered the baby blues (blue is, after all, for boys) might end up with lower IQs than the sons of mothers who have always been cheerful. Try to think back: there were bad days. How bad? Not bad enough, I think, to cause brain damage. So far, so promising. Deodorants may reduce male fertility. Fine by me. No threat (no sweat either). The latest research shows ... Studies suggest ... A new survey highlights ... As often as not, research is reported with no mention of its provenance. But even when we learn that findings are the result of a 'Social Trends' survey or from US NICHD, an American 'early childcare network', or the work of researchers from Harvard, we are not much the wiser. How the research was conducted is seldom explained. And the material itself is often remodelled like Plasticine to make a good story. To know what to believe, we would need to have been breathing down the researchers' necks ourselves, or at least to have been enlightened about their methods. So why bother to read about research at all? Research can be recreational. I read surveys as I might a zany horoscope, trying to fit it to my life. Some of it seems outlandish as astrology, some of it the work of a pedestrian Cassandra. I read with self-interested discrimination, ignoring what I don't want to hear, dwelling on what I do. I like this: 'Mothers who work on newspapers are twice as likely as fathers to be given more responsibility in their jobs, without this being reflected in a higher salary.' I am less taken with last week's research about young men reluctant to leave home. Apparently, one third of young men between the ages of 20 and 35 still live with their parents. I do a quick calculation. I am 42. My youngest son is one. I am never going to be free again. Research can be demoralising. It can be like one of those trick pictures: hold it this way and you see a beautiful curvy woman with a beckoning smile. Blink. Who is that frightening old hag who has taken her place? It can hit a nerve. Take last Monday's Panorama programme on working mothers. This was a kitchen-sink drama that will have made some women look back in anger, others look forward with fear. Panorama commissioned its 'own research' into working women and analysed 560 working mothers. It was discovered that, within two years, more than a third of them had given up full-time work. Seventeen per cent had become part-time workers and 19 per cent had given up work altogether. The scale of defection was on the increase and the reason for the exodus was inflexible employers with family-unfriendly policies. That was one piece of research. Another scrap hurled into Panorama's unpleasantly bubbling stew was the finding that mothers who work could impair their children's academic prowess. A study (of uncertain origin) to be published this Spring will explain that the children of full-time working mothers are likely to do worst at school and are less likely to achieve A-levels than other children. And it is not just educational deprivation that is on the agenda. Another survey a few months ago reported: 'Children who have less time in the care of their mothers during their first three years of life have less warm and positive relationships with them.' But other research last year (commissioned by Harriet Harman from the Institute of Education) flips the coin over. It found that the experience of childcare could be positive as long as it began after a child's first birthday. The children of working mothers might do better in maths and be less aggressive than those with mothers at home. A further study last year suggested that working mothers make the best managers. Being a mother, the theory goes, is an education in management. These women's lives may resemble overflowing suitcases. But they know how to fit everything in and sit on the lid. Working fathers can also read about themselves with interest. Research last year showed that the rise of the 10-hour working day may reduce a father's time with his children to 15 minutes a day. Another earlier study claimed that even a 'five-minute chat' with Dad every day gives children a 'far greater chance of becoming confident adults'. What should we conclude? Dads can spend 10 of their 15 minutes ignoring their children, as long as the kids get that quality five minutes? And then there is divorce: A rise in deaths from drink-related diseases is linked to Britain's divorce rate ... Children are unaffected by the emotional trauma of divorce if their parents split up before they are five ... Children of divorced parents are twice as likely to experience psychological, economic and social problems in adolescence and adulthood ... Children of divorced parents are 50 per cent less likely to end their own marriage in divorce than in 1973. What is the purpose behind research of this kind? Is there an evangelical intention? Is the idea that parents will be less inclined to part after considering the more negative of these findings? I have been puzzling, too, about the point of the research about boys becoming dimmer as a result of their Mum's postnatal depression. If true, of what use is it? It might make a mother guiltier. It couldn't make a boy brighter. And yet we remain obsessed with research. We live in a peculiarly rudderless society where we are not short of individual opinions but curiously unable to act on them. Companies cannot move without research - it is a sort of dragnet that can prevent bold, confident thinking. And we expect to hear about our personal lives through studies of the lives of strangers. We look at research as into a distorting mirror. The impulse is not straightforwardly narcissistic because what we see is not always flattering. Perhaps all we want is to have our opinions given an official stamp of approval, to have hopeful suspicions confirmed and fears allayed. Perhaps we want the companionship of knowing we fit into a general picture. But all research, I think, should be approached with caution. I have only to recall being on the receiving end of a market researcher's attentions last year to reinforce this view. She came to see me, ostensibly to find out my views about London buses. It was like taking a most puzzling exam. Her route to knowledge was longer, more circuitous and much more tedious than crossing town on the number 19 bus. Most of her questions seemed to have little to do with transport and many I found impossible to answer. Keen to oblige, I'd take a pot shot at questions I could not handle. In retrospect, I can think of only one good thing about the woman: her interest was in buses and not in my children. Incidentally, new research suggests that people who spend too long reading surveys become ... Please complete, as appropriate.",

Significantly, in the new play for which he is best known, The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, the heroine has an uncanny ability to make old songs sound more vibrantly authentic than when sung by their famous creators. In turning to the cinema with his directorial debut, American Beauty, Mendes manages to give individuality and distinction to some extremely familiar material. <p>Fifty years ago when McCall's carried the sub-title 'the magazine of togetherness', the term 'dysfunctional family' would have been regarded as an oxymoron; today, the term is virtually a tautology. But starting with Death of a Salesman and such influential texts of the Fifties as The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit, The Exurbanites, The Lonely Crowd and The Organisation Man, Americans were told that the national dream was a sham, the nuclear family a nightmare, the corporate existence a form of living death. In the following decade there was a revolt against convention and conformity from which the country has not fully recovered.

This is the caricatured stuff of sitcoms, and the screenwriter, Alan Ball, spent three seasons as writer-producer of Cybill.

This downward mobility is seen as admirable, as opposed to his wife's business activities which are viewed as risible and never more so than when she becomes the lover of a real-estate rival. </p> <p>Lester, with underlying hints of displaced incest, is drawn to his daughter's best friend, the self-consciously sexy high-school cheerleader Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), whose surname sounds the same as that of Dolores Haze, better known as Lolita. This dubious relationship inspires a series of surreal fantasies that relate to the film's central theme as expressed in the title. The cold, materialist Carolyn Burnham grows American Beauties, those roses noted for their large red petals, in the front garden beside the white picket fence.

      "body": "<p>After working in New York for five years, I'm finally returning to London. The ostensible reason is to live with my English girlfriend, but I probably would have come back anyway, sooner or later. My immigrant dream of finding success and happiness in the New World has turned to dust. Don't get me wrong. I'm not returning to England a bitter and disappointed man. I still love New York. The problem is, New York never loved me.</p> <p>When I first arrived here in 1995, I thought the world was my oyster - at least, it would be after I'd eaten a dozen or two. By all accounts, I'd entered a single man's paradise. I'd heard that statistic that an unmarried woman in her thirties in New York is more likely to get struck by lightning than find a husband. With all those singletons around, how hard could it be to get lucky?</p> <p>I was particularly excited because I'd landed a job at Vanity Fair, the American monthly edited by Graydon Carter. Ever since I'd published my first piece in a national newspaper - The Observer, as it happens - I'd fantasised about working for a glossy, New York magazine. Getting that phone call from Graydon Carter was the equivalent of the telegram Herman J. Mankiewicz sent Ben Hecht from Hollywood in 1926: 'Will you accept three hundred per week to work for Paramount Pictures? All expenses paid. The three hundred is peanuts. Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don't let this get around.'</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 Nast, the magazine stable of which Vanity Fair is a part, also publishes Vogue, GQ, Glamour, Allure and Mademoiselle, so I was looking forward to being surrounded by some of the most beautiful women in the world. Indeed, I made a joke about this shortly after arriving. A group of new recruits was being given a tour of Cond\u00e9 Nast's headquarters by a senior editor who told us that if we ever lost our bearings we could always examine 'the model' in the lobby. 'Which one?' I asked. Nobody laughed.</p> <p>The following morning I found a memo on my desk headed 'Policy on Harassment'. 'It has long been the policy of Cond\u00e9 Nast to maintain a professional working environment for all employees, free of any form of discrimination or harassment,' it began. The next bit was underlined in red, felt-tip pen: 'A joke considered amusing by one may be offensive to another.' It went on to list various forms of conduct that would 'result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal'. They were: Sexual remarks, advances, propositions\u0085 Touching or other physical contact \u0085 Repeated requests for dates or other social engagements \u0085 Comments about an individual's body.</p> <p>I was astonished. I pointed out to a female colleague that if Romeo had stuck to these rules he never would have ended up with Juliet. She looked at me as if I was a Neanderthal. The contrast with the ribald, bawdy atmosphere of Fleet Street couldn't have been greater. I felt like Austin Powers, the snaggle-toothed secret agent who was frozen in the Swinging Sixties and brought back to life in a more abstemious era.</p> <p>Back in my flat in Shepherd's Bush, I used to dream about what my social life would be like as a magazine editor in New York. I naively thought I'd be surrounded by members of the contemporary equivalent of the Algonquin Round Table, trading wisecracks between sips of their martinis. Instead, I found myself in a world that seemed like it had been dreamt up by members of that circle on a particularly drunken night. It goes without saying that I was cast as the rube, the out-of-town patsy who's always the butt of the joke.</p> <p>Take my efforts to book a table at Balthazar, a high-visibility restaurant that opened shortly after I arrived. During the brief period it was in fashion, the only way to get a reservation was to call a secret number that its owner, Keith McNally, had given to a few select people so they could leapfrog the waiting list. I managed to persuade an editor at Vanity Fair to give me the number and asked the man who answered the phone if I could book a table for eight the following Saturday.</p> <p>'How did you get this number?' he demanded.</p> <p>'Keith gave it to me,' I replied.</p> <p>'This is Keith speaking,' he said. 'Who is this?'</p> <p>That threw me. I hadn't expected the owner to answer the phone. I blurted out my own name which clearly meant absolutely nothing to him.</p> <p>'We don't do tables for eight,' he told me. 'Our maximum is six.'</p> <p>'Can I book a table for six then?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'Well, what's the maximum I can get?'</p> <p>'I dunno,' he replied. 'One?'</p> <p>I almost took it just to get a look at the place.</p> <p>Needless to say, I soon fell foul of Cond\u00e9 Nast's sexual harassment guidelines. One of the first friends I made at Vanity Fair was a young researcher called Chris Lawrence, largely because he was an unreconstructed frat boy. On his birthday I decided, rather rashly, to hire a strippergram. The magazine's fashion director, Elizabeth Saltzman, gamely allowed me to use her office for the festivities, and at the appointed hour we lured Chris down there on some spurious pretext. The stripper was straight from central casting - ie New Jersey - and she strutted her stuff to Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' which she played on a boogie box she'd brought along for the purpose.</p> <p>Everything was going swimmingly until we heard a faint knocking sound on Elizabeth's door followed by a plaintive, little girl's voice asking if she could come in. Elizabeth shut off the music, told us all to be quiet and cracked open the door. It was Bronwen, Graydon Carter's three-year-old daughter. In my wisdom, I'd arranged for a strippergram to come to the office on Bring Your Daughter To Work Day.</p> <p>Outside the office, my career as a single man wasn't going much better. For instance, on one memorable night in the summer of 1996 I found myself out on the town with two supermodels. Somehow, after a Vanity Fair photo shoot, I'd managed to persuade them to come with me to Hogs &amp; Heffers, a motorcycle bar in New York's meat-packing district. When we arrived there was a long line of people waiting to get in and one of the girls asked me if there was anything I could do. I boldly marched up to the front of the queue and introduced myself to the doorman, a grizzled biker in full Hell's Angel gear.</p> <p>'Do I really have to stand in line?' I asked him. 'I'm on the list.'</p> <p>He looked a little sceptical so I leant forward and, in a conspiratorial whisper, added: 'I'm with two supermodels.'</p> <p>'The only list you're on is the stupid list,' he bellowed. 'Back of the line.' Needless to say, I went home alone that night.</p> <p>Reluctantly, I concluded I might be setting my sights a little high, so I decided to pursue some 'mortals', as non-models are referred to at Cond\u00e9 Nast. It was time to hit New York's famous singles bars. I decided to approach this as systematically as possible so I got hold of a copy of How To Pick Up Girls and went through it with an attractive friend called Lorna, hoping to select the best lines. Of course, by today's standards How To Pick Up Girls is laughably unsophisticated. For instance, I can't see many modern women responding favourably to the question: 'Would you like some help parking that?' None the less, after picking Lorna's brains, I did at least manage to identify some lines that weren't instantly greeted with hoots of derisive laughter.</p> <p>My first port of call was 147, a restaurant with a lively bar scene in New York's Chelsea district. It was a Friday night so it was 'a target-rich environment' to quote Tom Cruise in Top Gun. I approached a beautiful Asian girl in her early twenties sitting at the bar.</p> <p>'Excuse me,' I ventured, 'it's my birthday today. Would you help me celebrate by joining me for a drink?'</p> <p>Lorna had identified this as the single best line in the book. I smiled at the girl, trying to appear as unthreatening as possible.</p> <p>'Is it really your birthday?' she asked.</p> <p>'Yes,' I replied confidently.</p> <p>'Prove it,' she said.</p> <p>'I'm sorry?'</p> <p>'Prove it,' she repeated. 'Show me some ID.'</p> <p>'I'm afraid I didn't bring any with me,' I said, trying not to look too flustered.</p> <p>She gave me an appraising glance. 'Sorry,' she concluded. 'Sounds like a line.' Strike one.</p> <p>Next stop was Clementine, a trendy lounge in SoHo. By now it was 10.30pm and there were plenty of single girls in groups of twos and threes at the bar. I approached a pretty brunette and hit her with a line Lorna had identified as a humdinger: 'You have one of the nicest smiles I've ever seen.'</p> <p>'How do you know?' she shot back.</p> <p>'I couldn't help noticing it from the other side of the room,' I replied, flashing her what I hoped was my sexiest, Hugh Grant grin.</p> <p>'Well you don't,' she snapped and then turned her back on me.</p> <p>Strike two.</p> <p>My third attempt took place at Moomba, a white-hot bar-restaurant in Greenwich Village that attracts a high-profile fashion crowd. I managed to weasel my way into the VIP section on the top floor where I came face to face with some of the best-looking girls I'd ever seen. I approached an outstanding blonde who was dancing by herself.</p> <p>'Are you a model?' I asked. According to How To Pick Up Girls, 'Any girl will be thrilled to have you mistake her for a model.'</p> <p>'Yes,' she replied contemptuously and went on dancing.</p> <p>Strike three.</p> <p>I decided to abandon my hunt for Mrs Goodbar. Contrary to the impression held by many of my British friends, New York women do not go home with men they meet in bars, at least not if they're clutching a copy of How To Pick Up Girls.</p> <p>I was fired from Vanity Fair in 1998, but I managed to land a job at Gear, a Loaded-like men's magazine that had just been launched by Bob Guccione Jr. He put me on the masthead as a 'Staff Writer' and talked about turning me into the next P.J. O'Rourke. Three months later he fired me. I took him out for a drink and managed to persuade him to rehire me but, sure enough, after three months had elapsed he fired me again. It seemed the world wasn't ready for another P.J. O'Rourke. Suddenly, I found myself unemployed.</p> <p>It was at this point, I'm ashamed to say, that I began to miss the British class system. I yearned for the social safety net that was provided by my membership of the educated bourgeoisie back home. In New York, where almost everyone is on the make, you're judged solely according to your value as a contact. People are interested in where you're going, not where you're from. They make no bones about this. If you're in a position to help them, they're more than happy to help you, inviting you to parties, introducing you to their friends, plugging you into their networks. But if you have nothing to offer in exchange, you might as well not exist.</p> <p>For instance, when people asked me what I did at parties, and I told them I worked for Vanity Fair, a noticeable change would come over them. They'd stop looking over my shoulder for a second and give me the once-over. They might even talk to me for five minutes. Evidently, I was someone worth cultivating.</p> <p>After I became 'a nobody', to use the standard expression, I vanished from the radar screen. Being neither rich, successful, good looking nor well-connected, I was literally not worth knowing. No sooner had the words 'I'm just a freelance hack' come out of my mouth than the person I was talking to was hastily backing off, wondering how they could politely ask for their business card back. It was a brutal reality check. I'd assumed that people liked me for who I was, not what I did, but in Manhattan you are what you do.</p> <p>I didn't even have much luck trading on my Britishness, surely the last resort of the expat scoundrel. In New York these days, being a Brit is a distinctly double-edged sword. On the one hand, there's a pronounced strain of Anglophilia running through the whole city, from Brooks Brothers to the Knickerbocker Club. On the other, the Brits are regarded with a great deal of suspicion. Could our fancy clothes and pretty manners be a cunning disguise, a way of lulling our less sophisticated cousins into a false sense of security before making off with the family silver? Oddly enough, I noticed that the more pro-British a person was, the greater their conviction that we were laughing at them behind their back. Anglophilia and Anglophobia seemed to go hand in hand.</p> <p>Perhaps the most regrettable manifestation of our declining fortunes is that the British accent no longer acts like an aphrodisiac on the opposite sex. This may have been true once, but successive generations of free-loading shits have poisoned that well. We're no longer thought of as possessing charm, discretion, gallantry, reserve, and all those other gentlemanly virtues. Rather, the term 'Englishman' conjures up an image of a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking yob who's here to fleece the locals for whatever he can get. Nowadays, we're just another ethnic minority battling for our slice of the American pie, no different from the Turks, the Armenians or the Pakistanis. It won't be long before we're driving New York cabs.</p> <p>After I lost my job at Gear, my prospects in the dating arena followed a similar trajectory. I've heard that single women outnumber single men here by a ratio of two to one, but even with those odds I didn't have much luck. When New York women complain that there's a shortage of men in this town what they mean is there's a shortage of tall, unattached, rich men who still have their own hair. As a short, bald, William Hague lookalike with no visible means of support, I wasn't considered much of a catch. Every New York woman I ever went out with had a checklist of questions she shamelessly ran through over the course of the evening. What did I do for a living? What part of town was my apartment in? What kind of car did I drive? It was less like a romantic encounter than an extremely tough job interview. By the time the bill arrived I was surprised they hadn't asked for a urine sample.</p> <p>Perhaps the solution was to get myself 'focus grouped'. I'd read an article in the New York Times that said some single men had become so desperate to improve their dating prospects they'd started seeking the help of marketing experts. The idea is to treat yourself like a product that's not doing as well as it should and get a market research company to 're-brand' you. You assemble a representative sample of the 'market' you're aiming at - in my case, single women between the ages of 18 and 35 - and hire a consultant to find out where you're going wrong.</p> <p>I approached a market research company called Focus Suites who put me in touch with a Hazel Kahan. She'd already helped one thirtysomething man 're-brand' himself and she agreed to do the same for me. When it came to the focus group, I decided to ask women I knew rather than six complete strangers. This was partly because I thought they'd offer more valuable advice, but mainly because I hoped they wouldn't be too hard on me. I also decided to tell them I'd be watching them from behind a two-way mirror, again in the hope that they wouldn't be too mean. I should have realised that your friends never need much of an excuse to be rude about you.</p> <p>It was as though a sophisticated group of consumers who were used to shopping at Harvey Nicks were being asked how they felt about some generic product from Woolworths. The low point came when Hazel Kahan asked Candace Bushnell, the author of Sex and the City, who had befriended me when I first moved to New York, if she'd ever consider going out with me.</p> <p>'I just can't imagine it at all,' she replied. 'He's just, you know, so much like someone I would be friends with and I would never, I could never\u0085'</p> <p>'You don't think of him as a sex person, is what I'm hearing?' interrupted Hazel.</p> <p>'I don't,' said Candace.</p> <p>'I don't think anybody does,' said Hazel, summing up. 'Would anyone like some more wine?'</p> <p>Forget the wine, Hazel. How about some hemlock?</p> <p>Fortunately, in the autumn of 1997 I met Caroline. She was 23 at the time and she'd just arrived in New York to work as a legal assistant at a big law firm. She was smart, sexy, ambitious: had she been American, she wouldn't have looked twice at me.</p> <p>Fortunately, she was English. Unlike the American women I'd met in New York, who tended to judge men according to whether they possessed certain desirable attributes, Caroline seemed more interested in what kind of person I was. The fact that she found me funny was a big help. American women had never laughed at my jokes.</p> <p>Naturally, the course of true love never runs smooth. Caroline dumped me for a handsome lawyer after three months but, through sheer, bloody-minded persistence, I managed to win her back. Then she dumped me again. She went back to England last summer but over Christmas she agreed to go back out with me, provided I moved to London. I didn't hesitate for a second.</p> <p>I can imagine people reading this and not feeling much sympathy for me. I went to New York hoping to trade on the fact that I'm a heterosexual, white male from a reasonably privileged background, only to find myself in a ruthless, meritocratic society in which my membership of these groups counted for very little. Well, all I can say in my defence is it worked for Alistair Cooke.</p> <p>I don't feel as though I'm defined by those labels, but as far as most New Yorkers are concerned, I probably am. Perhaps I'll be regarded in a similar light in Blair's Britain, where I gather the class system is rapidly being dismantled. Still, I hope we don't end up rewarding success and punishing failure as excessively as they do in New York. Britain is still a kinder, gentler place than America and long may it remain so.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After working in New York for five years, I'm finally returning to London. The ostensible reason is to live with my English girlfriend, but I probably would have come back anyway, sooner or later. My immigrant dream of finding success and happiness in the New World has turned to dust. Don't get me wrong. I'm not returning to England a bitter and disappointed man. I still love New York. The problem is, New York never loved me. When I first arrived here in 1995, I thought the world was my oyster - at least, it would be after I'd eaten a dozen or two. By all accounts, I'd entered a single man's paradise. I'd heard that statistic that an unmarried woman in her thirties in New York is more likely to get struck by lightning than find a husband. With all those singletons around, how hard could it be to get lucky? I was particularly excited because I'd landed a job at Vanity Fair, the American monthly edited by Graydon Carter. Ever since I'd published my first piece in a national newspaper - The Observer, as it happens - I'd fantasised about working for a glossy, New York magazine. Getting that phone call from Graydon Carter was the equivalent of the telegram Herman J. Mankiewicz sent Ben Hecht from Hollywood in 1926: 'Will you accept three hundred per week to work for Paramount Pictures? All expenses paid. The three hundred is peanuts. Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don't let this get around.' Cond\u00e9 Nast, the magazine stable of which Vanity Fair is a part, also publishes Vogue, GQ, Glamour, Allure and Mademoiselle, so I was looking forward to being surrounded by some of the most beautiful women in the world. Indeed, I made a joke about this shortly after arriving. A group of new recruits was being given a tour of Cond\u00e9 Nast's headquarters by a senior editor who told us that if we ever lost our bearings we could always examine 'the model' in the lobby. 'Which one?' I asked. Nobody laughed. The following morning I found a memo on my desk headed 'Policy on Harassment'. 'It has long been the policy of Cond\u00e9 Nast to maintain a professional working environment for all employees, free of any form of discrimination or harassment,' it began. The next bit was underlined in red, felt-tip pen: 'A joke considered amusing by one may be offensive to another.' It went on to list various forms of conduct that would 'result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal'. They were: Sexual remarks, advances, propositions\u0085 Touching or other physical contact \u0085 Repeated requests for dates or other social engagements \u0085 Comments about an individual's body. I was astonished. I pointed out to a female colleague that if Romeo had stuck to these rules he never would have ended up with Juliet. She looked at me as if I was a Neanderthal. The contrast with the ribald, bawdy atmosphere of Fleet Street couldn't have been greater. I felt like Austin Powers, the snaggle-toothed secret agent who was frozen in the Swinging Sixties and brought back to life in a more abstemious era. Back in my flat in Shepherd's Bush, I used to dream about what my social life would be like as a magazine editor in New York. I naively thought I'd be surrounded by members of the contemporary equivalent of the Algonquin Round Table, trading wisecracks between sips of their martinis. Instead, I found myself in a world that seemed like it had been dreamt up by members of that circle on a particularly drunken night. It goes without saying that I was cast as the rube, the out-of-town patsy who's always the butt of the joke. Take my efforts to book a table at Balthazar, a high-visibility restaurant that opened shortly after I arrived. During the brief period it was in fashion, the only way to get a reservation was to call a secret number that its owner, Keith McNally, had given to a few select people so they could leapfrog the waiting list. I managed to persuade an editor at Vanity Fair to give me the number and asked the man who answered the phone if I could book a table for eight the following Saturday. 'How did you get this number?' he demanded. 'Keith gave it to me,' I replied. 'This is Keith speaking,' he said. 'Who is this?' That threw me. I hadn't expected the owner to answer the phone. I blurted out my own name which clearly meant absolutely nothing to him. 'We don't do tables for eight,' he told me. 'Our maximum is six.' 'Can I book a table for six then?' 'No.' 'Well, what's the maximum I can get?' 'I dunno,' he replied. 'One?' I almost took it just to get a look at the place. Needless to say, I soon fell foul of Cond\u00e9 Nast's sexual harassment guidelines. One of the first friends I made at Vanity Fair was a young researcher called Chris Lawrence, largely because he was an unreconstructed frat boy. On his birthday I decided, rather rashly, to hire a strippergram. The magazine's fashion director, Elizabeth Saltzman, gamely allowed me to use her office for the festivities, and at the appointed hour we lured Chris down there on some spurious pretext. The stripper was straight from central casting - ie New Jersey - and she strutted her stuff to Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' which she played on a boogie box she'd brought along for the purpose. Everything was going swimmingly until we heard a faint knocking sound on Elizabeth's door followed by a plaintive, little girl's voice asking if she could come in. Elizabeth shut off the music, told us all to be quiet and cracked open the door. It was Bronwen, Graydon Carter's three-year-old daughter. In my wisdom, I'd arranged for a strippergram to come to the office on Bring Your Daughter To Work Day. Outside the office, my career as a single man wasn't going much better. For instance, on one memorable night in the summer of 1996 I found myself out on the town with two supermodels. Somehow, after a Vanity Fair photo shoot, I'd managed to persuade them to come with me to Hogs &amp; Heffers, a motorcycle bar in New York's meat-packing district. When we arrived there was a long line of people waiting to get in and one of the girls asked me if there was anything I could do. I boldly marched up to the front of the queue and introduced myself to the doorman, a grizzled biker in full Hell's Angel gear. 'Do I really have to stand in line?' I asked him. 'I'm on the list.' He looked a little sceptical so I leant forward and, in a conspiratorial whisper, added: 'I'm with two supermodels.' 'The only list you're on is the stupid list,' he bellowed. 'Back of the line.' Needless to say, I went home alone that night. Reluctantly, I concluded I might be setting my sights a little high, so I decided to pursue some 'mortals', as non-models are referred to at Cond\u00e9 Nast. It was time to hit New York's famous singles bars. I decided to approach this as systematically as possible so I got hold of a copy of How To Pick Up Girls and went through it with an attractive friend called Lorna, hoping to select the best lines. Of course, by today's standards How To Pick Up Girls is laughably unsophisticated. For instance, I can't see many modern women responding favourably to the question: 'Would you like some help parking that?' None the less, after picking Lorna's brains, I did at least manage to identify some lines that weren't instantly greeted with hoots of derisive laughter. My first port of call was 147, a restaurant with a lively bar scene in New York's Chelsea district. It was a Friday night so it was 'a target-rich environment' to quote Tom Cruise in Top Gun. I approached a beautiful Asian girl in her early twenties sitting at the bar. 'Excuse me,' I ventured, 'it's my birthday today. Would you help me celebrate by joining me for a drink?' Lorna had identified this as the single best line in the book. I smiled at the girl, trying to appear as unthreatening as possible. 'Is it really your birthday?' she asked. 'Yes,' I replied confidently. 'Prove it,' she said. 'I'm sorry?' 'Prove it,' she repeated. 'Show me some ID.' 'I'm afraid I didn't bring any with me,' I said, trying not to look too flustered. She gave me an appraising glance. 'Sorry,' she concluded. 'Sounds like a line.' Strike one. Next stop was Clementine, a trendy lounge in SoHo. By now it was 10.30pm and there were plenty of single girls in groups of twos and threes at the bar. I approached a pretty brunette and hit her with a line Lorna had identified as a humdinger: 'You have one of the nicest smiles I've ever seen.' 'How do you know?' she shot back. 'I couldn't help noticing it from the other side of the room,' I replied, flashing her what I hoped was my sexiest, Hugh Grant grin. 'Well you don't,' she snapped and then turned her back on me. Strike two. My third attempt took place at Moomba, a white-hot bar-restaurant in Greenwich Village that attracts a high-profile fashion crowd. I managed to weasel my way into the VIP section on the top floor where I came face to face with some of the best-looking girls I'd ever seen. I approached an outstanding blonde who was dancing by herself. 'Are you a model?' I asked. According to How To Pick Up Girls, 'Any girl will be thrilled to have you mistake her for a model.' 'Yes,' she replied contemptuously and went on dancing. Strike three. I decided to abandon my hunt for Mrs Goodbar. Contrary to the impression held by many of my British friends, New York women do not go home with men they meet in bars, at least not if they're clutching a copy of How To Pick Up Girls. I was fired from Vanity Fair in 1998, but I managed to land a job at Gear, a Loaded-like men's magazine that had just been launched by Bob Guccione Jr. He put me on the masthead as a 'Staff Writer' and talked about turning me into the next P.J. O'Rourke. Three months later he fired me. I took him out for a drink and managed to persuade him to rehire me but, sure enough, after three months had elapsed he fired me again. It seemed the world wasn't ready for another P.J. O'Rourke. Suddenly, I found myself unemployed. It was at this point, I'm ashamed to say, that I began to miss the British class system. I yearned for the social safety net that was provided by my membership of the educated bourgeoisie back home. In New York, where almost everyone is on the make, you're judged solely according to your value as a contact. People are interested in where you're going, not where you're from. They make no bones about this. If you're in a position to help them, they're more than happy to help you, inviting you to parties, introducing you to their friends, plugging you into their networks. But if you have nothing to offer in exchange, you might as well not exist. For instance, when people asked me what I did at parties, and I told them I worked for Vanity Fair, a noticeable change would come over them. They'd stop looking over my shoulder for a second and give me the once-over. They might even talk to me for five minutes. Evidently, I was someone worth cultivating. After I became 'a nobody', to use the standard expression, I vanished from the radar screen. Being neither rich, successful, good looking nor well-connected, I was literally not worth knowing. No sooner had the words 'I'm just a freelance hack' come out of my mouth than the person I was talking to was hastily backing off, wondering how they could politely ask for their business card back. It was a brutal reality check. I'd assumed that people liked me for who I was, not what I did, but in Manhattan you are what you do. I didn't even have much luck trading on my Britishness, surely the last resort of the expat scoundrel. In New York these days, being a Brit is a distinctly double-edged sword. On the one hand, there's a pronounced strain of Anglophilia running through the whole city, from Brooks Brothers to the Knickerbocker Club. On the other, the Brits are regarded with a great deal of suspicion. Could our fancy clothes and pretty manners be a cunning disguise, a way of lulling our less sophisticated cousins into a false sense of security before making off with the family silver? Oddly enough, I noticed that the more pro-British a person was, the greater their conviction that we were laughing at them behind their back. Anglophilia and Anglophobia seemed to go hand in hand. Perhaps the most regrettable manifestation of our declining fortunes is that the British accent no longer acts like an aphrodisiac on the opposite sex. This may have been true once, but successive generations of free-loading shits have poisoned that well. We're no longer thought of as possessing charm, discretion, gallantry, reserve, and all those other gentlemanly virtues. Rather, the term 'Englishman' conjures up an image of a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking yob who's here to fleece the locals for whatever he can get. Nowadays, we're just another ethnic minority battling for our slice of the American pie, no different from the Turks, the Armenians or the Pakistanis. It won't be long before we're driving New York cabs. After I lost my job at Gear, my prospects in the dating arena followed a similar trajectory. I've heard that single women outnumber single men here by a ratio of two to one, but even with those odds I didn't have much luck. When New York women complain that there's a shortage of men in this town what they mean is there's a shortage of tall, unattached, rich men who still have their own hair. As a short, bald, William Hague lookalike with no visible means of support, I wasn't considered much of a catch. Every New York woman I ever went out with had a checklist of questions she shamelessly ran through over the course of the evening. What did I do for a living? What part of town was my apartment in? What kind of car did I drive? It was less like a romantic encounter than an extremely tough job interview. By the time the bill arrived I was surprised they hadn't asked for a urine sample. Perhaps the solution was to get myself 'focus grouped'. I'd read an article in the New York Times that said some single men had become so desperate to improve their dating prospects they'd started seeking the help of marketing experts. The idea is to treat yourself like a product that's not doing as well as it should and get a market research company to 're-brand' you. You assemble a representative sample of the 'market' you're aiming at - in my case, single women between the ages of 18 and 35 - and hire a consultant to find out where you're going wrong. I approached a market research company called Focus Suites who put me in touch with a Hazel Kahan. She'd already helped one thirtysomething man 're-brand' himself and she agreed to do the same for me. When it came to the focus group, I decided to ask women I knew rather than six complete strangers. This was partly because I thought they'd offer more valuable advice, but mainly because I hoped they wouldn't be too hard on me. I also decided to tell them I'd be watching them from behind a two-way mirror, again in the hope that they wouldn't be too mean. I should have realised that your friends never need much of an excuse to be rude about you. It was as though a sophisticated group of consumers who were used to shopping at Harvey Nicks were being asked how they felt about some generic product from Woolworths. The low point came when Hazel Kahan asked Candace Bushnell, the author of Sex and the City, who had befriended me when I first moved to New York, if she'd ever consider going out with me. 'I just can't imagine it at all,' she replied. 'He's just, you know, so much like someone I would be friends with and I would never, I could never\u0085' 'You don't think of him as a sex person, is what I'm hearing?' interrupted Hazel. 'I don't,' said Candace. 'I don't think anybody does,' said Hazel, summing up. 'Would anyone like some more wine?' Forget the wine, Hazel. How about some hemlock? Fortunately, in the autumn of 1997 I met Caroline. She was 23 at the time and she'd just arrived in New York to work as a legal assistant at a big law firm. She was smart, sexy, ambitious: had she been American, she wouldn't have looked twice at me. Fortunately, she was English. Unlike the American women I'd met in New York, who tended to judge men according to whether they possessed certain desirable attributes, Caroline seemed more interested in what kind of person I was. The fact that she found me funny was a big help. American women had never laughed at my jokes. Naturally, the course of true love never runs smooth. Caroline dumped me for a handsome lawyer after three months but, through sheer, bloody-minded persistence, I managed to win her back. Then she dumped me again. She went back to England last summer but over Christmas she agreed to go back out with me, provided I moved to London. I didn't hesitate for a second. I can imagine people reading this and not feeling much sympathy for me. I went to New York hoping to trade on the fact that I'm a heterosexual, white male from a reasonably privileged background, only to find myself in a ruthless, meritocratic society in which my membership of these groups counted for very little. Well, all I can say in my defence is it worked for Alistair Cooke. I don't feel as though I'm defined by those labels, but as far as most New Yorkers are concerned, I probably am. Perhaps I'll be regarded in a similar light in Blair's Britain, where I gather the class system is rapidly being dismantled. Still, I hope we don't end up rewarding success and punishing failure as excessively as they do in New York. Britain is still a kinder, gentler place than America and long may it remain so.",

      "body": "<p>'Right now, I'm sorta hot,' said William H. Macy, and shivered. We were crossing a gritty street in the meat-packing district of Manhattan, lashed by polar gales; the temperature, factoring in the wind chill, was minus 15. 'You've gotta seize the day,' Macy added, as a refrigerated blast hit us.</p> <p>Macy was referring to his career, not the weather. Perhaps he does not enjoy name recognition. His name, in fact, was already spoken for when he got his Equity card. He had a homonym, a now-forgotten sitcom actor, so he had to differentiate himself by coughing a middle initial. But you will certainly recognise the face, which resembles a careworn potato with doggily doleful, liquid eyes. It has been visible, on and off, in some of the best films of recent years.</p> <p>He specialises in anonymity. He played a catastrophically ineffectual car salesman in the Coen brothers' Fargo, and earned an Oscar nomination; in Barry Levinson's Wag the Dog he was a bland but sinister CIA functionary. He took the Martin Balsam role, as the private eye with the punctured forehead, in Gus van Sant's pastiche of Psycho. ('Boy, was that a bad idea!' he now remarks of the po-mo concept.)</p> <p>His is a retro face which looks at home in the past, whether as a Fifties grey man in Gary Ross's Pleasantville or a cuckolded porn director from the psychedelic Sixties in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights. He has a winning line in losers: in Anderson's forthcoming Magnolia, he is a washed-up quiz kid, alcoholically soliloquising in a bar.</p> <p>Nevertheless, these are all roles which the business tactfully qualifies as 'supporting'. 'I would love to be the guy,' Macy told me. 'You know, the guy who gets the girl.' On film, it seems unlikely, but in his current project Macy has finally secured the lead. At the Donmar Warehouse, he is playing the historic hood Teach in David Mamet's American Buffalo, a volcanically voluble three-hander about a muddled heist; the production is imported from the Atlantic Theatre Company in New York, jointly founded by Macy and his mentor Mamet. 'Teach,' Macy says with shy self-satisfaction, 'is the show-off part.' Even so, in this brutally male world there is no girl to get, only - to quote Teach - 'a Southern bulldyke asshole ingrate of a vicious nowhere c--,' who remains offstage.</p> <p>Macy has risen through the ranks to claim the lead in American Buffalo for himself. In Chicago in 1975, he played the dopey gofer Bobby, abused and finally bludgeoned by the ranting Teach. He already knew Mamet, who was his drama tutor at college in Vermont. 'Dave brought this script in and just kinda tossed it down and said, \"You might want to take a look at this.\" The moment I opened it, I absolutely, totally knew. I desperately wanted that role, and it was my first professional job. I joined the union on Buffalo. Ah,' he sighed, 'Bobby - the kid's so sweet, honest, guileless.' These are emotions which Macy does inimitably well. Whether he can pull off Teach's bravura tantrums remains to be seen.</p> <p>He admitted his intimidation. The role has been played on stage by Robert Duvall (icily glowering) and Al Pacino (operatically rabid), and on film by Dustin Hoffman, whose Teach is a crazed fusspot. 'Sure, I got some ghosts,' shrugged Macy. 'I got some heavy hitters dukin' it about in my head.' The idiom is revealing: after 30 years spent working with Mamet, Macy's natural lingo is the street-smart jive talk which the dramatist has perfected. 'Dave,' as he said, 'writes profanities in iambic pentameter.' Macy has the same wacky eloquence. 'Teach is a poisonous worm,' he told me as he ate a tuna sandwich. 'Mother Teresa could read Teach and she'd come out fulla shit.'</p> <p>Though Macy may lack Pacino's decibels and his demonic fury, he promises a Buffalo which will be 'more humorous than other productions, and more intellectual. Yeah, and it will be whiter.' Macy speaks with Mametesque smudged consonants, and I thought he had said wider. When I queried this, he punctiliously dotted the t for me and pointed to the ethnic origins he shares with Philip Baker Hall, who plays Don, the owner of a junk shop intent on fencing a stolen coin with a buffalo head on it. 'The two of us as WASPy as the day is long.'</p> <p>Buffalo, I gather, is to be taken back from the Italian stallions and Jewish nebbishes who have commandeered it. Otherwise, Macy's instincts are collaborative not competitive. He feels he is joining a fraternity of famous Teaches. 'When you meet another actor who's done Buffalo, the two of you just start riffin' the lines, goin' through the routines. I know no other play where that happens. It's so funny, so true, and so exquisitely wrought. It's like humming a tune both of you know and love.' He illustrated with one of Teach's cadenzas: ' \"Fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie.\" That's the voice of the poet!'</p> <p>Not the least of the challenges posed by Teach is the actor's need to time such repetitive outbursts, and to calibrate sputtering interjections in his squabbles with Bobby and Don. Gregory Mosher, who directed the Chicago premiere and the recent film, remembers Dustin Hoffman rehearsing with a video replay and plaintively asking the script girl: 'Christine, is it, \"Fuck you. Pause. Fuck. Pause. Fuck you?\" or, \"Fuck you. Fuck. Pause. Fuck?\" '</p> <p>Macy is more nonchalant, less of a maniacal perfectionist. 'Dave always says to ignore the language, it's just gibberish. You can't act the language, you've gotta act what's behind it. Action talks, character walks - that's his motto. Besides, Buffalo isn't Dave's hardest play to memorise. I thought I'd put a gun in my mouth when I started to learn Oleanna.'</p> <p>Macy created the role of the enraged academic accused of sexual harassment in this play, and at the end of every performance beat up Mamet's wife, who was his accuser. At a time when political correctness was epidemic, Oleanna excited frenzies of indignation. Macy relished its ideological pugilism. 'We opened in Boston, in a theatre with a really low stage. I could eyeball the audience, and I could also see when they were rarin' to come at us. I told myself that if they were gonna come after anyone, it had to be the broad - surely she was the villain. But how could I let them get at Dave's wife? So every night I got ready to drop-kick someone off the edge of the stage when it looked like we were gonna have a visitor.'</p> <p>Asked about the rights and wrongs of Oleanna, Macy shrewdly coupled the character and the dramatist. 'Hey, what can I tell you? Dave's a paternalistic bombastic asshole himself - plus he's a certified genius. He's so brilliant, he just kills me. Smartest man I ever knew. Taught me every goddam thing I know. Teach, after all, is a teacher, a demented pedagogue whose educational methods are radical. \"Only way to teach these people is to kill them,\" he says at the beginning of the play.'</p> <p>Macy, remembering his early drama lessons with Mamet, offered me a small exclusive footnote to the history of modern American theatre: 'Yeah, Dave was Teach. I knew that guy back when he was hockin' his watch every two weeks to pay his poker debts. He used to play with some guy called Henry the Fence up on 12th Street in Chicago, and these card-sharps really loved it when they found out Dave was a professor, teaching classes at the university - so they gave him the nickname.'</p> <p>As one of Mamet's buddies, Macy is guaranteed more or less permanent employment. One of his forthcoming films is State and Main, written and directed by Mamet and set in Vermont, where they met. 'It's about a huge Hollywood movie that goes on location to New England and just totally trashes this small town. Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are the stars of the movie they're making, and I'm the director - a real megalomaniac. Lots of Dave's pals are in it.'</p> <p>Meanwhile Macy is glad to be back in the theatre, devoting three conscientious months to Mamet's iambic expletives, rather than lucratively busking for a few days on a movie set. 'Some nights, a weird thing happens in the theatre. You get into such a zone, kinda outta body. I'm just standin' there, watchin' myself act. It never happens in a movie, because you never get the time. But on stage you sometimes say, \"Right, go boy, take it man, keep rockin', I don't know what's goin' on.\" All I can tell you is that the muse descends.'</p> <p>Is it the muse or perhaps Mamet, muttering dictation while holding a cigar clamped between his vituperative lips? At the beginning of his career, the forename Macy registered with Equity was W.H., which has recently morphed into William H. Mr W.H., as it happens, is the shadowy actor gratefully acknowledged by Shakespeare as the 'only begetter' of his sonnets. I hope Macy's admiration for Mamet is reciprocated.</p> <p>\u0095 American Buffalo opens at the Donmar Warehouse, 3 February. Magnolia opens 3 March.</p>",

He has a winning line in losers: in Anderson's forthcoming Magnolia, he is a washed-up quiz kid, alcoholically soliloquising in a bar. Nevertheless, these are all roles which the business tactfully qualifies as 'supporting'. 'I would love to be the guy,' Macy told me. 'You know, the guy who gets the girl.' On film, it seems unlikely, but in his current project Macy has finally secured the lead. At the Donmar Warehouse, he is playing the historic hood Teach in David Mamet's American Buffalo, a volcanically voluble three-hander about a muddled heist; the production is imported from the Atlantic Theatre Company in New York, jointly founded by Macy and his mentor Mamet. 'Teach,' Macy says with shy self-satisfaction, 'is the show-off part.' Even so, in this brutally male world there is no girl to get, only - to quote Teach - 'a Southern bulldyke asshole ingrate of a vicious nowhere c--,' who remains offstage. Macy has risen through the ranks to claim the lead in American Buffalo for himself. In Chicago in 1975, he played the dopey gofer Bobby, abused and finally bludgeoned by the ranting Teach. He already knew Mamet, who was his drama tutor at college in Vermont. 'Dave brought this script in and just kinda tossed it down and said, \"You might want to take a look at this.\" The moment I opened it, I absolutely, totally knew. I desperately wanted that role, and it was my first professional job. I joined the union on Buffalo. Ah,' he sighed, 'Bobby - the kid's so sweet, honest, guileless.' These are emotions which Macy does inimitably well. Whether he can pull off Teach's bravura tantrums remains to be seen. He admitted his intimidation. The role has been played on stage by Robert Duvall (icily glowering) and Al Pacino (operatically rabid), and on film by Dustin Hoffman, whose Teach is a crazed fusspot. 'Sure, I got some ghosts,' shrugged Macy. 'I got some heavy hitters dukin' it about in my head.' The idiom is revealing: after 30 years spent working with Mamet, Macy's natural lingo is the street-smart jive talk which the dramatist has perfected. 'Dave,' as he said, 'writes profanities in iambic pentameter.' Macy has the same wacky eloquence. 'Teach is a poisonous worm,' he told me as he ate a tuna sandwich. 'Mother Teresa could read Teach and she'd come out fulla shit.' Though Macy may lack Pacino's decibels and his demonic fury, he promises a Buffalo which will be 'more humorous than other productions, and more intellectual. Yeah, and it will be whiter.' Macy speaks with Mametesque smudged consonants, and I thought he had said wider. When I queried this, he punctiliously dotted the t for me and pointed to the ethnic origins he shares with Philip Baker Hall, who plays Don, the owner of a junk shop intent on fencing a stolen coin with a buffalo head on it. 'The two of us as WASPy as the day is long.' Buffalo, I gather, is to be taken back from the Italian stallions and Jewish nebbishes who have commandeered it. Otherwise, Macy's instincts are collaborative not competitive. He feels he is joining a fraternity of famous Teaches. 'When you meet another actor who's done Buffalo, the two of you just start riffin' the lines, goin' through the routines. I know no other play where that happens. It's so funny, so true, and so exquisitely wrought. It's like humming a tune both of you know and love.' He illustrated with one of Teach's cadenzas: ' \"Fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie, fuckin' Ruthie.\" That's the voice of the poet!' Not the least of the challenges posed by Teach is the actor's need to time such repetitive outbursts, and to calibrate sputtering interjections in his squabbles with Bobby and Don. Gregory Mosher, who directed the Chicago premiere and the recent film, remembers Dustin Hoffman rehearsing with a video replay and plaintively asking the script girl: 'Christine, is it, \"Fuck you. Pause. Fuck. Pause. Fuck you?\" or, \"Fuck you. Fuck. Pause. Fuck?\" ' Macy is more nonchalant, less of a maniacal perfectionist. 'Dave always says to ignore the language, it's just gibberish. You can't act the language, you've gotta act what's behind it. Action talks, character walks - that's his motto. Besides, Buffalo isn't Dave's hardest play to memorise. I thought I'd put a gun in my mouth when I started to learn Oleanna.' Macy created the role of the enraged academic accused of sexual harassment in this play, and at the end of every performance beat up Mamet's wife, who was his accuser. At a time when political correctness was epidemic, Oleanna excited frenzies of indignation. Macy relished its ideological pugilism. 'We opened in Boston, in a theatre with a really low stage. I could eyeball the audience, and I could also see when they were rarin' to come at us. I told myself that if they were gonna come after anyone, it had to be the broad - surely she was the villain. But how could I let them get at Dave's wife? So every night I got ready to drop-kick someone off the edge of the stage when it looked like we were gonna have a visitor.' Asked about the rights and wrongs of Oleanna, Macy shrewdly coupled the character and the dramatist. 'Hey, what can I tell you? Dave's a paternalistic bombastic asshole himself - plus he's a certified genius. He's so brilliant, he just kills me. Smartest man I ever knew. Taught me every goddam thing I know. Teach, after all, is a teacher, a demented pedagogue whose educational methods are radical. \"Only way to teach these people is to kill them,\" he says at the beginning of the play.' Macy, remembering his early drama lessons with Mamet, offered me a small exclusive footnote to the history of modern American theatre: 'Yeah, Dave was Teach. I knew that guy back when he was hockin' his watch every two weeks to pay his poker debts. He used to play with some guy called Henry the Fence up on 12th Street in Chicago, and these card-sharps really loved it when they found out Dave was a professor, teaching classes at the university - so they gave him the nickname.' As one of Mamet's buddies, Macy is guaranteed more or less permanent employment. One of his forthcoming films is State and Main, written and directed by Mamet and set in Vermont, where they met. 'It's about a huge Hollywood movie that goes on location to New England and just totally trashes this small town. Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are the stars of the movie they're making, and I'm the director - a real megalomaniac. Lots of Dave's pals are in it.' Meanwhile Macy is glad to be back in the theatre, devoting three conscientious months to Mamet's iambic expletives, rather than lucratively busking for a few days on a movie set. 'Some nights, a weird thing happens in the theatre. You get into such a zone, kinda outta body. I'm just standin' there, watchin' myself act. It never happens in a movie, because you never get the time. But on stage you sometimes say, \"Right, go boy, take it man, keep rockin', I don't know what's goin' on.\" All I can tell you is that the muse descends.' Is it the muse or perhaps Mamet, muttering dictation while holding a cigar clamped between his vituperative lips? At the beginning of his career, the forename Macy registered with Equity was W.H., which has recently morphed into William H. Mr W.H., as it happens, is the shadowy actor gratefully acknowledged by Shakespeare as the 'only begetter' of his sonnets. I hope Macy's admiration for Mamet is reciprocated. \u0095 American Buffalo opens at the Donmar Warehouse, 3 February. Magnolia opens 3 March.",

      "body": "<b>This Is Your Life</b> BBC1 <br> <b>The White Tribe Debate</b> Channel 4 <p>Last Tuesday so many people were talking about Ian Wright's This Is Your Life - one of the proverbial office water-cooler TV moments - that when the tape finally turned up I had made sure there was a box of Kleenex to hand. I'd been warned: 'I don't want to oversell it to you, but it was like...' and here a colleague dabbed cartoonishly at his eyes and mimed an exaggeratedly sad-clown expression - male shorthand for the process of feeling emotions. (Wondering if small boys really do learn their communication skills from clowns is almost as disturbing as imagining that little girls define their adult body image courtesy of ballerinas.) 'And it also made you realise, with a bit of a shock, that you never get to see that many black people on prime-time TV.' </p> <p>'You talking about Ian Wright?' interjected another male colleague. 'Oh! Amazing! I mean, I cried!' Later that day, in a newsagents, I overheard the proprietor talking to a male customer about 'that Ian Wright on That's Life [sic]. Fantastic. I tell you, it made me a little bit moist-eyed. And I'm a Spurs fan, nahwotamean?' Something was definitely going on, but what precisely? And was it a male thing?</p> <p>'Don't suppose you saw Ian Wright on This Is Your Life on Monday?' I inquired of my very female, twentysomething neighbour the following day. 'Oh yeah! I cried!' she said. 'And when Paul Ince came on! And Maxi Priest! Oh it was wonderful.' Right. So not just a male thing, then. Later, on the phone to a girlfriend who had once worked on a TV commercial alongside Gary Lineker without knowing who he was, I said, tentatively: 'I don't suppose you saw Ian Wright\u0085?' </p> <p>'Oh! Don't! I even wrote something in my diary about it. It was the most brilliant programme and I'm so glad I watched it. It was life-affirming!' </p> <p>'Life-affirming? And I thought you'd say \"Who's Ian Wright?\" What on earth did you put in your diary?' </p> <p>'I thought it was great that even though Ian Wright has buns of steel he is married to such a lovely\u0085 big girl who obviously hasn't! And did you see the bit with Paul Ince? They were just so sweet together\u0085' </p> <p>And on and on. So, eventually, I got the tape. At the beginning, when he caught sight of Michael Aspel walking on to the set of his own chat show, Wright's handsome, wide-eyed face broke into a predictably surprised-but-happy grin and then, just as quickly, it crumpled into the sort of overwhelmed and teary expression you might see on the face of a small boy who has just opened a yearned-for present on Christmas Day and discovered that it contains whatever it is a small boy most wants on Christmas Day. Head in hands, Wright was visibly moved as his audience whooped and hollered, their fists punching the air in circles - 'Awwwwright!' - before he was led to the studio next door and a second audience. By this time, he was clutching a balled-up handkerchief. He wasn't the only one.</p> <p>'Big up!' said Lennox Lewis - probably the only black British sportsman who calls football 'soccer' - on his filmed message. And was that Clive Anderson, the famously acerbic and not obviously very soppy chat show host, wiping away a tear? And 'he's got me all emotional, man!' said old schoolfriend, a sniffling Maxi Priest. While, for the record, this critic cried because during last week's This Is Your Life - yes, that silly old time-warped, crushingly banal charade, a TV retirement home for old golfers and last-gasp comedians - you got the sense that these people really cared for Wright and he really cared for them and that he was an awful nice guy. </p> <p>And while there was a complete lack of fashionable metropolitan cyncism about the proceedings, there was no icky sentimentality either - just a big, warm celebration featuring an awful lot of very un-white, un-middle-class touchy-feeliness. Suddenly, in living colour, England looked like another country, and it was good.</p> <p>'I tell you why it got to me,' admitted a (thirtysomething white, male, middle-class, not knowingly sporty) friend a couple of days after he had surprised himself by blubbing on the sofa. 'I was jealous of Wright. Not of his footballing skills, but of' - big pause, small sigh - 'of his intense-looking friendships and his family and the way he talked so proudly about his adopted son, the one who plays for Manchester City, and the way that boy is so obviously proud of him, too, and...' But I knew exactly what he meant. All that demonstrative love. 'Don't get me started,' I said.</p> <p>'Do English people know who they are any more?' asked Jon Snow, a man with the whitest of white English names, at the top of The White Tribe Debate, a late-night 'live' spin-off from Darcus Howe's three-part Channel 4 documentary about the state of Englishness, and apparently capitalising on the series's 'controversy'. </p> <p>The controversy passed me by, I'm afraid. Black writer travels around England looking for Modern Englishness and decides that 'New England lies just below the surface of the old'; that when he first came to Britain, 'every stereotype was true, [but now] it is more spicy, less dependable, less English than it was then'; that England is a country of 'French wine, German cars and Italian coffee'. Is this controversial? Still, Howe had a few of his own preconceptions turned on their head. </p> <p>He was, for example, surprised by how much he liked and got on with Mary 'I know who I am!' Benson, who was landed gentry from Northumberland and a keen rider to hounds ('The bloodsport is the central ritual of her Englishness,' said Howe eloquently and possibly even accurately). Howe admitted he'd assumed that, being 'an upper-class white', Mary would also be racist - but she wasn't, of course, because she was far too no-nonsense and secure in her own identity. The real surprise was how surprised Howe seemed by this - but surely he must have noticed that racism is the preserve of those whose identity is out of focus, whose sense of self is fuzzily illogical, who constantly feel threatened by extinction?</p> <p>Howe told us that he thought a bunch of politely waltzing pensioners from Yorkshire reminded him of the people he'd met when he first came to England 40 years ago, 'people full of confidence and dignity, whom I held in high regard'. These were, apparently, 'the last of the good England, the best of it...' Was the man blind?</p> <p>Well, enough to be hurt and surprised to learn that these same people confided their bigotry easily to the camera - lamenting 'multiculture... the ethnic problem, you know what I mean...' and describing the English as 'a superior race' - as soon as Howe's back was turned. But it came as no surprise to this viewer to learn that this lot were a bunch of ignorant racists because they all had the kind of dull, scared, bovine eyes that told us they'd see the existence of French mustard in the supermarket as a dangerous threat to their Englishness. Elsewhere, Howe was baffled by the ghastly, gated private estate in Essex with its faux village pond and terrifying, middle-aged inhabitants ('We have a train interest and do bus photography as a hobby'); and was 'nervous of being a black man wandering around a white ghetto' (Cleveland's grim Grangetown estate, all CCTV cameras and Taking Without Owner's Consent, 'bunches of urchins babbling inanities' on its streets and shelves of dried peas in the windowless, armour-plated local shop). But the residents had bigger things to be bothered about than Howe, like the sheer bloody pointlessness of their dismal lives.</p> <p>The White Tribe Debate was scheduled late on Thursday night. I'm afraid I only lasted about 15 minutes because, for the most part, we were talking 'debate' in the slaveringly Pavlovian, synapse-snappingly histrionic style of The Jerry Springer Show, which will put anyone with half a brain in touch with their dark side, the secret inner place where we are all capable of running amok with an AK47. I mean, how many stupid, bigoted, boring, angry, disaffected, privileged, white, English people arguing about not being able to celebrate St George's Day can you really stomach at midnight?</p> <p>Do English people know who they are any more? Well, I think Ian Wright probably has a good idea who he is, and some of the rest of us might just have a hunch who we're not - and that's got to be a start.</p>",

      "byline": "by Antony Barnett and Paul Farrelly",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>LABOUR'S former paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson wrote to the late Robert Maxwell's son Kevin, hatching a secret plan to win European grants for a company that was not eligible for them.</p> <p>In May 1990 Robinson wrote a confidential memo on House of Commons paper asking Kevin Maxwell if the structure of a Maxwell company could be changed to make it eligible for a grant. Experts say such a ploy would not have been illegal but was likely to have been in breach of the spirit of the grant rules.</p> <p>The grants were mainly aimed at helping smaller companies, and to bar large corporations from abusing the system the rules insist that firms applying are standalone companies and not merely part of a larger organisation.</p> <p>Robinson's memo to Kevin Maxwell, dated 23 May, states: 'In order for Lock to qualify for a number of these schemes as a small-medium-size enterprise [SME] it must fall within the agreed definition, ie. an independent company with less than 500 employees. I have spoken with Mike Stoney [Robert Maxwell's accountant] and I gather that AML [also known as Lock] is owned by Pergamon. Would there be a way of having it not owned by a large company?! We are going for ... grants in Europe; and it would be very helpful to qualify as an SME.'</p> <p>It is unclear whether this plan was put into practice, but the contents of the memo will turn the heat back on Robinson's past business activities. Last week Robinson's former chief accountant at TransTec, the failed West Midlands engineering company once chaired by Robinson, accused the Labour MP of misleading the DTI over grants - allegations Robinson categorically denies. The DTI, which is examining accounting irregularities at TransTec, has now widened its inquiry into all grants the company received. Maurice Fitzpatrick of accountancy firm Chantrey Vellacott DFK said: 'It appears that Robinson was aware that the ownership of Lock would have to be transferred out of Pergamon so that as a standalone firm it might qualify for the grants. There is nothing illegal about this but questions will be asked whether this would have been within the spirit of the grant rules.'</p> <p>Robinson's note to Kevin Maxwell first emerged nearly two years ago when links between the former paymaster general and the Maxwell empire were being investigated. But the contents of the letter received little attention. Now, with the grants that Robinson's firms received coming under close scrutiny, the memo will give further fuel to his critics.</p> <p>The Tories will tomorrow table further questions in the House of Commons for trade secretary Stephen Byers, demanding information on grants involving other companies linked to Robinson. Trade and industry spokes woman Angela Browning said: 'These revelations mean it is absolutely essential that questions over significant sums of public money are answered quickly and transparently.'</p> <p>Inquiries by The Observer have raised questions this weekend over a \u00a3175,000 government grant paid to a subsidiary of TransTec. Since 1987 the group had received a total of \u00a31.3 million in grants through the DTI. One of the biggest of these was for \u00a3175,000, awarded to car components maker BSK Aluminium which it received in January 1997.</p> <p>BSK is one of the firms at the centre of the DTI inspectors' investigation into alleged false accounting at TransTec over an \u00a311m compensation claim by Ford which was not disclosed to shareholders.</p> <p>Although BSK had previously referred to grants it had received in its balance sheet under the heading 'amortisation of grants', there is no mention of it in BSK's accounts for 1997 or 1998. There is no suggestion anything illegal has taken place.</p> <p>Robinson, who did not return calls from The Observer last week, was never on the board of BSK, which was acquired by TransTec in 1996. Last week Robinson came out fiercely rebutting all claims that he had acted improperly and welcoming the DTI inquiry into TransTec.</p> <p>Two former directors of TransTec also came out defending Robinson. Kevin Maxwell could not be contacted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "LABOUR'S former paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson wrote to the late Robert Maxwell's son Kevin, hatching a secret plan to win European grants for a company that was not eligible for them. In May 1990 Robinson wrote a confidential memo on House of Commons paper asking Kevin Maxwell if the structure of a Maxwell company could be changed to make it eligible for a grant. Experts say such a ploy would not have been illegal but was likely to have been in breach of the spirit of the grant rules. The grants were mainly aimed at helping smaller companies, and to bar large corporations from abusing the system the rules insist that firms applying are standalone companies and not merely part of a larger organisation. Robinson's memo to Kevin Maxwell, dated 23 May, states: 'In order for Lock to qualify for a number of these schemes as a small-medium-size enterprise [SME] it must fall within the agreed definition, ie. an independent company with less than 500 employees. I have spoken with Mike Stoney [Robert Maxwell's accountant] and I gather that AML [also known as Lock] is owned by Pergamon. Would there be a way of having it not owned by a large company?! We are going for ... grants in Europe; and it would be very helpful to qualify as an SME.' It is unclear whether this plan was put into practice, but the contents of the memo will turn the heat back on Robinson's past business activities. Last week Robinson's former chief accountant at TransTec, the failed West Midlands engineering company once chaired by Robinson, accused the Labour MP of misleading the DTI over grants - allegations Robinson categorically denies. The DTI, which is examining accounting irregularities at TransTec, has now widened its inquiry into all grants the company received. Maurice Fitzpatrick of accountancy firm Chantrey Vellacott DFK said: 'It appears that Robinson was aware that the ownership of Lock would have to be transferred out of Pergamon so that as a standalone firm it might qualify for the grants. There is nothing illegal about this but questions will be asked whether this would have been within the spirit of the grant rules.' Robinson's note to Kevin Maxwell first emerged nearly two years ago when links between the former paymaster general and the Maxwell empire were being investigated. But the contents of the letter received little attention. Now, with the grants that Robinson's firms received coming under close scrutiny, the memo will give further fuel to his critics. The Tories will tomorrow table further questions in the House of Commons for trade secretary Stephen Byers, demanding information on grants involving other companies linked to Robinson. Trade and industry spokes woman Angela Browning said: 'These revelations mean it is absolutely essential that questions over significant sums of public money are answered quickly and transparently.' Inquiries by The Observer have raised questions this weekend over a \u00a3175,000 government grant paid to a subsidiary of TransTec. Since 1987 the group had received a total of \u00a31.3 million in grants through the DTI. One of the biggest of these was for \u00a3175,000, awarded to car components maker BSK Aluminium which it received in January 1997. BSK is one of the firms at the centre of the DTI inspectors' investigation into alleged false accounting at TransTec over an \u00a311m compensation claim by Ford which was not disclosed to shareholders. Although BSK had previously referred to grants it had received in its balance sheet under the heading 'amortisation of grants', there is no mention of it in BSK's accounts for 1997 or 1998. There is no suggestion anything illegal has taken place. Robinson, who did not return calls from The Observer last week, was never on the board of BSK, which was acquired by TransTec in 1996. Last week Robinson came out fiercely rebutting all claims that he had acted improperly and welcoming the DTI inquiry into TransTec. Two former directors of TransTec also came out defending Robinson. Kevin Maxwell could not be contacted.",

We don't like the basement flats either - doors that creak, the feeling that there might be someone there still.'</p> <p>'And I hate the bluebottles,' adds Debbie. 'Big, fat, buzzing bluebottles. I've got a thing about them.'</p> <p>'She has; Debbie has a real thing about them.'</p> <p>'Especially in the summer, when it's hot. They're everywhere. I don't know how I coped with them all through my pregnancy.'</p> <p>'Some of the smells get to you. When they've laid there for a week.'</p> <p>'That's worse in summer, too.'</p> <p>'Summer's bad. The stench. You can taste it in your mouth for the whole day.'</p> <p>'You smell of death. Death is in your clothes, in your hair.'</p> <p>'And then the buckets of urine that are often there, pails of shit - you mustn't disturb the buckets or it gets much worse. The first time, I asked Alice if they'd been making home-brewed beer. \"Is it beer?\" I asked. One man kept all his in paper carrier bags. I don't mind looking at the bodies, though. Alice doesn't look, but it doesn't bother me, really. I look. I look at them.'</p> <p>'I don't like the body fluids much, I have to say. Maggots come up from them and they crystallise. They crunch when you walk on them. Crunch crunch crunch.'</p> <p>'Crunch,' adds Debbie absent-mindedly, filling out her forms.</p> <p>What about the sadness? I ask. Do they mind the sadness of their job, the loneliness they witness, the grief and the guilt and the pity of it all? Are they never winded by the terror of it, what it means about life? They look at me calmly, quite kindly. 'No. We don't dwell on that. We don't have time. Anyway, there's nothing we can do. These people are dead. Their lives are over. We deal with the dead.'</p> <p>Alice and Debbie work for Hackney Council, and they deal with bodies, with the corpses of people who die alone, and who have no obvious next of kin to take care of their properties, their wills, their funerals and their last rites. For most people, death has about it the consolation of passing on your memories and your possessions to the next generation - life as a link in a great chain - but for the people that Debbie and Alice help to bury, death is often a bleaker kind of terminus, and their possessions are the detritus of a life which must be tidied away: what they have loved becomes rubbish; those they have loved have disappeared and may never even know they have died.</p> <p>'This is Rose,' says Debbie, dismantling a bus pass found in the flat where an elderly woman was recently found. 'I look at their photographs, if we find photographs among their belongings, and I think I can tell something of their characters. Some of them look grumpy and some of them look rather pleasant, and I say to Alice, \"They would have been nice to know.\" Rose looks pleasant, I think.' She picks up a pair of long-bladed scissors and snips the plastic away from the photograph. The square-inch of Rose's face stares at us from the form-littered desk - a sweet, uncertain face under a short mop of greying hair. No family has claimed her yet. Who is it who cares that she has died? There is something peculiarly melancholy about a life that ends as a bad smell coming from the flat above, about a burial in a communal grave with a council providing the flowers and a parish priest as the lone mourner.</p> <p>About two people a week - sometimes many more - die alone in Hackney, with no obvious next of kin to claim them. They sometimes die on the street or in hospital, but usually they are in their own home. They may not be discovered for days, weeks, even months. Nobody notices they are gone. They have drifted out of their own lives, and nobody has even noticed their absence. Debbie and Alice go to their homes, often while the coroner is there with the body. They sift through all the possessions, read every letter and diary; all the evidence of their lives.</p> <p>Sometimes, next of kin are traced - estranged children, indifferent or tormented parents, siblings who have drifted apart, nephews or nieces who haven't seen them for years. They have to tell them about the death - often they get the relatives' outpourings of grief and guilt and defensive anger. If no relatives are found, then Alice and Debbie deal with the funeral: they contact the undertakers, the cemetery, the florists (Hackney is the only council that puts flowers on the coffin, and it was Alice who ensured this was done: 'A body is never just a body,' she says). If the dead person has left any money, expenses are deducted from this. They deal, too, with the property and the possessions that are left behind.</p> <p>They always keep the photographs, handing them to neighbours or friends if no family is found. 'Everything else,' says Alice ruefully, 'has to go. The whole lot. What would we do with it all?' So they act as untrained detectives, bereavement counsellors, house clearers and clerks. They do not, as they constantly tell me, dwell on the misery that their job is forever uncovering. They never go to the funerals. They do not have the time for curiosity. Once a file is closed, put away inside those large metal cabinets, then it is closed. 'I forget all my cases quite quickly, I put them away and move on to the next one,' says Debbie.</p> <p>Has no case especially got to you? I ask, as Debbie tosses a plastic folder containing a worn-thin ring on to her busy desk. They consider for a moment. Then Alice tells me about a French man ('Mr Frenchman,' she calls him) who died in a bedsit in Hackney.</p> <p>'It was a blitz, his room,' she says, wrinkling her nose. 'An absolute blitz. Infested, everything. We did a lot of detective work. We found out quite a lot about him, because it turned out that although he was an old man, he had a brother who was still alive in France, who came over. They'd drifted apart, hadn't contacted each other for years. But we found out that this old Mr Frenchman had his own house, a nice big house, just down the road from where he died in his nasty, filthy room that looked like the blitz. It made me curious, how that happened. His life, you know?'</p> <p>Debbie tells me about a young man who had hung himself in his Hackney flat on a New Year's Eve two years ago. His body, surrounded by sex toys and instruments of bondage, hadn't been found until February. 'He was unemployed. Nobody had missed him.' The young man had left a suicide note. Apparently he had killed himself because his gay lover had left him. Debbie and Alice tried to find his parents, but failed.</p> <p>'A lot of people wipe out their lives, you know,' says Debbie. 'They get rid of evidence of their lives. Their flats can be empty of everything like that - no photos, no letters, no diaries, no nothing.' They did manage to contact his boyfriend. 'He was very upset about the cat that had starved to death in the flat. I remember that: him being upset about the cat.'</p> <p>They pull out a fat folder which tells the partial story of a woman of 78 who died leaving behind two thirtysomething daughters, both of whom were in care with learning difficulties. 'The daughters couldn't be brought together, because if they ever saw each other they would fight, physically fight, just go at each other. We had to tell them separately; bring them to the flat separately to collect possessions, take them to the funeral separately. They were pretty matter-of-fact about their mother's death, I must say. Just kind of accepted it. It was a funny kind of case - a family who weren't a family.'</p> <p>Only one case has Debbie found herself unable to deal with - 'every time I picked up the phone, I just had to put it down again, until in the end I passed it over to Alice' - and that was the case of a little girl who died in Great Ormond Street. She can't remember why she died, only that her parents, who were African, wouldn't bury her. 'Apparently it was in their religion that children must bury their parents. Parents aren't supposed to bury their children. They just left her at the hospital. They wouldn't do anything with her, so we were called in. She was a little girl - not a baby, but quite a young girl. We contacted the parents to tell them about the funeral, but I don't know if they went to it.' But for the most part, it is old people whose bodies they bury, whose possessions they sort out, whose families they try to trace, whose coffins they buy, whose graves they decorate with flowers. A lot of old people die alone. Often, Alice says, when she discovers the kind of life an old woman or man has led, she thinks: 'At least they are at peace now, after everything they have gone through. At last they are at rest.' All those files, stacked in a sliding drawer in a metal cabinet: the bureaucracy of dying.</p> <p>And all those unclaimed lives. All that loneliness on all our doorsteps. When I left the council office, I walked along the streets, looking up at the high windows and basement windows, where people live and people die, and we don't notice when they go, and sometimes it is left to two kind women to be their final witnesses.</p> <p>\u0095 More cases featuring the women from Hackney's Protection of Property unit can be seen on Everyman, 'Dying Alone', on Sunday, 6 February, at 10.35pm on BBC1</p>",

      "body": "<b> Race sport book scores own goal </b> <br> <p> Contrary to the impression given by Denis Campbell's article on John Entine's book Taboo (News, last week), scientists have not discovered a link between skin colour and sports performance and are never likely to. Entine's argument is a rehash of the pseudo-scientific arguments that have been promoted since the 1920s and 1930s. </p> <p>Do people really believe that Andy Cole or Shaka Hislop possess special biological qualities under their skin that give them an advantage over Michael Owen or David Seaman? </p> <p>Explanations have to start with the disproportionate participation rates which channel so many black youngsters into particular sports, and the limited opportunities available to working-class youth, white and black, that make a career in sports seem like a realistic goal. </p> <p>As for the suggestion that scientists have 'proved' that white men cannot run or jump, presumably Entine believes that Jonathan Edwards is a black man. <br><b> Ben Carrington</b><br>Education and Sport faculty<br>University of Brighton<br> Eastbourne<br><br><b> Sky scraper </b><br> </p> <p> In only two years the BBC's continuous television news service, News 24, has scored a remarkable success by comparison with its rivals, CNN and Sky News. The latest figures, for audiences in December, indicate that 6.5 million people watch News 24, compared with only 4.2 million for Sky. We are very proud of this success. </p> <p>We are not surprised, though, by the media campaign, spearheaded by the Murdoch group with its major interest in Sky News, to persuade the Government to force the closure of News 24. The Sun has been the loudest in this attack, but somehow it forgot to tell its readers there might be a link between its campaign and commercial interests of the group it belongs to. </p> <p>It is quite wrong for the Murdoch group to try to talk the Government into getting rid of Sky's only competitor in the UK. It would be equally wrong for the Government to take any notice. We believe that a great many people would be appalled if the BBC were penalised because it was competing too well with Murdoch's media empire. <br><b> John Simpson</b>, World Affairs Editor <br><b>Brian Hanrahan</b>, Diplomatic Correspondent<br><b>Allan Little</b>, Moscow correspondent<br><b>Jeremy Bowen</b>, Middle East Correspondent<br><b>George Alagiah</b>, Presenter <br><b>Tom Carver</b>, Washington Correspondent<br><b>James Robbins</b>, Diplomatic Correspondent<br><b> Gavin Hewitt</b>, Special Correspondent <br><b>David Loyn</b>, World Affairs Correspondent<br><b>Philippa Thomas</b>, Washington Correspondent <br><b>Rageh Omaar</b>, Developing World Correspondent <br><br></p> <p><b> Offensive words </b><br> </p> <p> While I support Stephen Bayley's argument that urban design is more important than often appreciated (Comment, last week), was it really necessary for him to use phrases such as 'limp-wristed faggot'? I found this upsetting and unacceptable. Would The Observer tolerate the racial equivalents of 'pooftah' and 'faggot'?<br><b> Mark Griffiths</b><br>London<br><br> </p> <p><b> Control freakery </b><br> </p> <p> You are right to highlight the anti-democratic consequences of New Labour's ruthless attempts to suppress any voice that deviates from Downing Street's Regime of Truth (Leader comment, last week). Tony Blair's shameless recent attack on Ken Livingstone for creating his own inner circle, and for 'gesture politics', not only takes political hypocrisy to new levels of bare-faced cynicism, but betrays a power junkie's greatest fear. <br><b> Dr Richard House</b><br>Norwich <br><br> </p> <p><b> All political hues </b><br> </p> <p> Andy McSmith's article (News, last week) wrongly accuses the Democracy Movement of involvement with a 'plot' in the Conservative Party. The Democracy Movement has no involvement in internal processes of the parties. We are a non-party organisation sup ported by people from all political allegiances. Surely the Euro-lobby should accept that with their miserable 17 per cent of public support, not everyone who believes we should keep a national currency is a Conservative. <br><b> Russell Walters</b><br>London SW6 <br><br> </p> <p><b> Out of court </b><br> </p> <p> As a long-time reader and admirer of The Observer , it pained me to read a piece that apparently represented me as a wilful perjurer (Interview, last week). The article states that I '_admitted lying in court'. Totally untrue. Having had no connection with or involvement in the controversial libel case, I neither admitted to or ever appeared in court. Indeed at the time of agreeing to Jeffrey Archer's request to alibi him for having dinner with Andrina Colquhoun, I warned him that under no circumstances would I be prepared to repeat the alibi under oath in the event of the divorce proceedings he implied could result from his continued relationship with Miss Colquhoun. <br><b> Ted Francis</b><br>Surrey<br><br>Apologies to Mr Francis for this mistake, introduced in the editing process. <br><br><b> Minister replies </b><br> </p> <p> John Sweeney's remarks (Comment, last week) about the state of the NHS would have had greater impact if he had checked a few facts. He suggested that one solution for improving services in hospitals and GPs' surgeries was to establish an independent inspector. That is precisely what we have done. </p> <p>The Commission for Health Improvement was launched last November. During the next four years it will have a key role in helping to modernise the NHS by reviewing every hospital and primary care group in the country. </p> <p>I am also concerned that too many patients have suffered due to unacceptable variations in standards of care throughout the NHS. The CHI and the new National Institute for Clinical Excellence will help to address the standards and availability of care across the NHS. <br><b> Alan Milburn</b><br>Secretary of State for Health,Whitehall<br> London SW1</p>",

      "bodyText": "Race sport book scores own goal Contrary to the impression given by Denis Campbell's article on John Entine's book Taboo (News, last week), scientists have not discovered a link between skin colour and sports performance and are never likely to. Entine's argument is a rehash of the pseudo-scientific arguments that have been promoted since the 1920s and 1930s. Do people really believe that Andy Cole or Shaka Hislop possess special biological qualities under their skin that give them an advantage over Michael Owen or David Seaman? Explanations have to start with the disproportionate participation rates which channel so many black youngsters into particular sports, and the limited opportunities available to working-class youth, white and black, that make a career in sports seem like a realistic goal. As for the suggestion that scientists have 'proved' that white men cannot run or jump, presumably Entine believes that Jonathan Edwards is a black man. Ben Carrington Education and Sport faculty University of Brighton Eastbourne Sky scraper In only two years the BBC's continuous television news service, News 24, has scored a remarkable success by comparison with its rivals, CNN and Sky News. The latest figures, for audiences in December, indicate that 6.5 million people watch News 24, compared with only 4.2 million for Sky. We are very proud of this success. We are not surprised, though, by the media campaign, spearheaded by the Murdoch group with its major interest in Sky News, to persuade the Government to force the closure of News 24. The Sun has been the loudest in this attack, but somehow it forgot to tell its readers there might be a link between its campaign and commercial interests of the group it belongs to. It is quite wrong for the Murdoch group to try to talk the Government into getting rid of Sky's only competitor in the UK. It would be equally wrong for the Government to take any notice. We believe that a great many people would be appalled if the BBC were penalised because it was competing too well with Murdoch's media empire. John Simpson, World Affairs Editor Brian Hanrahan, Diplomatic Correspondent Allan Little, Moscow correspondent Jeremy Bowen, Middle East Correspondent George Alagiah, Presenter Tom Carver, Washington Correspondent James Robbins, Diplomatic Correspondent Gavin Hewitt, Special Correspondent David Loyn, World Affairs Correspondent Philippa Thomas, Washington Correspondent Rageh Omaar, Developing World Correspondent Offensive words While I support Stephen Bayley's argument that urban design is more important than often appreciated (Comment, last week), was it really necessary for him to use phrases such as 'limp-wristed faggot'? I found this upsetting and unacceptable. Would The Observer tolerate the racial equivalents of 'pooftah' and 'faggot'? Mark Griffiths London Control freakery You are right to highlight the anti-democratic consequences of New Labour's ruthless attempts to suppress any voice that deviates from Downing Street's Regime of Truth (Leader comment, last week). Tony Blair's shameless recent attack on Ken Livingstone for creating his own inner circle, and for 'gesture politics', not only takes political hypocrisy to new levels of bare-faced cynicism, but betrays a power junkie's greatest fear. Dr Richard House Norwich All political hues Andy McSmith's article (News, last week) wrongly accuses the Democracy Movement of involvement with a 'plot' in the Conservative Party. The Democracy Movement has no involvement in internal processes of the parties. We are a non-party organisation sup ported by people from all political allegiances. Surely the Euro-lobby should accept that with their miserable 17 per cent of public support, not everyone who believes we should keep a national currency is a Conservative. Russell Walters London SW6 Out of court As a long-time reader and admirer of The Observer , it pained me to read a piece that apparently represented me as a wilful perjurer (Interview, last week). The article states that I '_admitted lying in court'. Totally untrue. Having had no connection with or involvement in the controversial libel case, I neither admitted to or ever appeared in court. Indeed at the time of agreeing to Jeffrey Archer's request to alibi him for having dinner with Andrina Colquhoun, I warned him that under no circumstances would I be prepared to repeat the alibi under oath in the event of the divorce proceedings he implied could result from his continued relationship with Miss Colquhoun. Ted Francis Surrey Apologies to Mr Francis for this mistake, introduced in the editing process. Minister replies John Sweeney's remarks (Comment, last week) about the state of the NHS would have had greater impact if he had checked a few facts. He suggested that one solution for improving services in hospitals and GPs' surgeries was to establish an independent inspector. That is precisely what we have done. The Commission for Health Improvement was launched last November. During the next four years it will have a key role in helping to modernise the NHS by reviewing every hospital and primary care group in the country. I am also concerned that too many patients have suffered due to unacceptable variations in standards of care throughout the NHS. The CHI and the new National Institute for Clinical Excellence will help to address the standards and availability of care across the NHS.

But, although just four coaches long, when viewed next to Chiltern's battered, old British Rail suburban mules, the 168 looks, well, classy. Go-faster skirts, generous doors, restrained colour scheme and grey-tinted windows stretch the length of the carriage - all of a piece with the Mercedes diesel unit.

I ended up having to make my first call to him from a late non-168 Chiltern train, because the Clubman I'd planned to catch had broken down, throwing out the line's complete morning schedule for nearly three hours. Fine as the 168s are, their introduction has helped spoil Chiltern's record as one of the most punctual operators.</p> <p>So who's to blame? Well, not just Chiltern, which, like other operators, is suffering heavily from rising passenger numbers - up 65 per cent in five years. The 168 is based on a previous design, built originally by British Rail at Derby. After several owners and name changes, the company is now called Adtranz and owned by DaimlerChrysler. Chiltern's trains were the first of any kind ordered in Britain for three years and so were effectively prototypes. And prototypes never work properly - that's why they're called prototypes. Also, while the old trains had electrical switches and relays, the 168 is software-driven. Ask anyone who works in a computerised office - new software never works properly, either.</p> <p>Such is the scale of the problem, Andy tells me, that Chiltern's five 168s are all taking their turns to be fixed up back at Derby. The sweetness of privatisation, though, is that the cost for this is borne not by the passenger, nor by Chiltern, but by Adtranz. Which means Chiltern had enough money left over to order another five trains - though Andy admits they could probably do with four times that number. And Chiltern won't order those unless its franchise is extended.</p> <p>Oh well. As Lenin said, two steps back, three steps forward. Or was it two steps forward, three steps back?</p>",

French controllers, who are at the centre of a network of overflying services between Britain, Spain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, reported a 50 per cent rise in near misses last year involving civil airliners, reaching a peak of nearly one a day in the summer. One of the most dangerous routes was between Britain and Spain, where French controllers handled an average of 370 flights a day in 1999, an increase of 36 per cent from 1998. The rise in traffic was even sharper between Germany and Spain where 340 flights a day crossed France, a 38 per cent increase. Registered near misses doubled between June and October, rising from about 40 in 1998 to about 80 a year later. A full comparison for 1999 is not yet available, but the risk dropped to about five a month in the off-season of both years. Guillaume Blandel, national secretary of the French controllers union, SNCTA, which presented a report to 36 European aviation Ministers in Brussels this weekend, predicted that the number of flights crossing France would double from 2.4 million to 4.8m over the next 15 years. Aviation Ministers were in Brussels to discuss the growing problem of late flights and to update the co-ordinated programme called Eurocontrol which was devised in 1960. Closer co-operation was reinforced in 1995, but protesting air traffic controllers from several European Union countries said that airlines and Eurocontrol were more interested in economics than security. 'As far as we are concerned, Eurocontrol is a vast organisation of 2,000 people which spends more time justifying its existence than working on technical matters,' Blandel said. 'They are cut off from reality and subject to airline lobby groups.' Unions also complained about Eurocontrol's inability to persuade military authorities to give up airspace above 8,000 metres.

Tired, she wants a little 'lift' to get her through the Manhattan weekend's busy social calendar - tonight a private bash for a semi-famous friend at a trendy Martini bar in the West Village. She won't have to venture to a seedy apartment or dark street corner. Or even leave home. An eighth of an ounce of cocaine is just a phone call away.</p> <p>A half-hour later, a sleek black limousine pulls up outside an exclusive Park Avenue address on Manhattan's Upper East Side. A well-dressed man gets out of the passenger door carrying what appear to be business files and introduces himself to the doorman. Upstairs, an insistent intercom: 'Buzz him up, will you,' says Kristina, zipping up her new evening Prada, and reaching for her wallet.</p> <p>The limo has long since sped away, but it is back five minutes later to pick up the delivery man with his $150 and move on to the next address on the list. 'Kristina', a wealthy, hip and socially connected young businesswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity, is one of thousands of Manhattan socialites, executives and professionals who regularly use New York City's many drug home-delivery services.</p> <p>But for her and others like her, the past week and a half has not been fun: news of a big drug bust came a little too close to home. Federal prosecutors claimed to have broken up a massive Manhattan cocaine home-delivery ring that, they said, made the illegal drug 'as easy to order as a pizza'. They also seized a notebook detailing the names, addresses and phone numbers of more than 2,000 well-to-do customers.</p> <p>'Yeah, I'm a little nervous,' one anxious SoHo art dealer told me, after seeking assurances he would not be identified in print. He says he had learnt about the service from a friend and had used it 'more than a few times' in the past six months. 'It's so convenient, well, until now, I guess.'</p> <p>A hairdresser who had cocaine delivered to his exclusive Fifth Avenue salon says he cannot be sure whether the service he used was the one that got busted. 'It's torment. I'm afraid to call now, and a lot of people in the salon are pissed off that no one's answering their pagers. Everyone's a little jumpy, but hey, we're all having a healthier January,' he told me.</p> <p>No customers have been charged; at least not yet. The conspiracy case is the largest ever brought by the US Drug Enforcement Administration - in terms of number of customers and frequency of deliveries - involving a cocaine home-delivery ring, says federal prosecutor Marc Mukasey.</p> <p>The indictment alleges a 10-man ring made as much as $11,000 a day, delivering packets of the illicit white powder to individuals all over Manhattan: at major financial institutions, law firms, colleges, restaurants and bars - and ritzy private addresses on the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, newly fashionable Chelsea and the increasingly 'faux-Bohemian' SoHo.</p> <p>The investigation is reliant on hidden video cameras and mobile phone taps, and federal prosecutors have yet to release the names of any specific delivery spots, where no doubt other operators have filled the vacuum. 'There were thousands of customers - mostly yuppies. They must be sweating now,' said one DEA source, adding: 'There was style to it, it was definitely not a slipshod operation. They could deliver - within a half hour - all over New York City.'</p> <p>Run most recently from an apartment in College Point, Queens, the ring used more than 100 cellular phones and pagers to take orders, and six cars to deliver cocaine in Manhattan at prices ranging from $25 to $150.</p> <p>In an impatient and pampered city where anyone can order anything anytime and expect it on the doorstep within minutes, it was probably to be expected.

Now Jose Fernandez and Rafael Felipe, who allegedly operated the ring, are being held without bail, charged with conspiracy. Fernandez's defence attorney, Vincent Scalla, says the DEA found 'not one iota of drugs' in their investigation. Two alleged delivery men have also been arrested. Only two customers have been named directly in documents filed at the Federal District Court in Manhattan: Music executive Russell Calabrese, who runs a production company from his home on West 19th Street, and another man, Isuro Rivera, apparently known as 'Zorro', who allegedly ordered a delivery on 30 November. Calabrese was caught on video last August allegedly buying drugs in a Lincoln as the dealer drove him around the block. 'I have nothing to say about this, I don't want to talk about it,' he said, insisting he had 'no idea' if he would be called as a witness. Possession of even a small amount of cocaine - even half a gram - is a felony, and in New York State, that means a mandatory jail term of a year or more.

An old university friend recalls the day her new boyfriend at the time, trying to impress her, phoned 'his service' one Friday. 'He gave some kind of code name, and hung up. Twenty minutes later, this well-dressed guy is in the front hall opening up a big briefcase. 'I couldn't believe my eyes. He just sort of droned through it: ecstasy tablets for $10 apiece; coke in small bags for $50 and big bags for $150; little coloured boxes of three grades of marijuana; a whole load of other stuff, you know, pills, even smokable heroin.' It was she says, just a little too easy.",

Last Friday White, a former life sentence prisoner and one of the founders of the UFF in 1973, called on some of those young loyalists who had given him a hero's welcome back then at the height of their terror campaign to take a new leap of faith. White, the leader of the UFF-aligned Ulster Democratic Party, urged the largest loyalist terrorist group in Northern Ireland unilaterally to decommission some arms before the IRA begins to disarm.

This would be music to David Trimble's ears given the First Minister's insistence that the IRA and loyalists start to decommission, otherwise his Ulster Unionist Party will quit the power-sharing executive. White has almost sold the idea of decommissioning to the UFF leadership but one thing stands in the way: the inquiry into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. While White was giving interviews to the media inside the UDP's fortified office on the Shankill Road last week, a UFF leader spoke exclusively to The Observer in the backroom of a house in loyalist west Belfast. One of the most senior UFF commanders in Northern Ireland outlined why the organisation was not ready, yet, to disarm and why an investigation into a murder 11 years ago could still destabilise its ceasefire. Last week it emerged that English police officers investigating Finucane's murder and the subsequent allegations of security force collusion in the killing have identified six loyalists from west Belfast as the main suspects.

Don't blame the post: the Revenue will say you should have sent the return earlier. </p> <p>But some people will find a reprieve in the Steeden v Carver case, a court ruling made last November but given no publicity until this month. It means the strict 31 January deadline is being interpreted in practice as 7.30am on Wednesday. </p> <p>Many tax offices are open today to help with queries.

This means unit trust tracker funds are in danger of breaching rules that require them to hold no more than 10 per cent of a stock because they must mimic the index they follow. </p> <p>Discussions are under way between the industry and the regulator, the Financial Services Authority, over how to address this problem. Investors need not take any action, although some investment advisers are alerting investors to the fact that the increasing concentration of some companies and industries - such as technology - mean that tracker funds carry a higher risk than investors may realise. </p> <p>Jason Hollands of Best Investment and some other commentators want a review of the way the UK's main indices are constructed. </p> <p><strong> Under endowed</strong></p> <p>Insurance company CGU is promising the 600,000 people relying on its endowments to repay their homeloans that it will make good any shortfalls. </p> <p>There is a caveat; CGU will not cough up if average annual returns on its investments work out at less than 6 per cent. However, the company has produced returns well in excess of 6 per cent in the past, so the risk to policyholders now looks small. </p> <p>In another move that should help homeowners, the Council of Mortgage Lenders announced that from 11 February its members will no longer pursue repossessed borrowers for unpaid debts beyond six years, except in cases where proceedings have started. </p> <p><strong> Cars feel the heat</strong></p> <p>Cars are three times more likely to be set on fire and burnt out than they were a decade ago, warns Abbey National's insurance wing. </p> <p>The bank urges people to report abandoned cars to the police since they are easy tar gets for arson and to avoid letting rubbish build up, as it is often set ablaze. </p> <p>Fifty-six per cent of fires in Greater Manchester, Cleveland and West Yorkshire are started deliberately, according to the Home Office. </p> <p><strong> Inching up</strong></p> <p>National Savings is raising some of its interest rates - but not enough to win expert recommendation as a home for savers' money. </p> <p>The cash Isa rate goes up 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent from Tuesday, but is still 1 per cent behind the best, says researcher MoneyFacts.</p> <p><strong> Net advice</strong><br> </p> <p>Internet trading is covered in a new edition of The Which?

Anyone who receives a return is obliged to complete and return it. However, some people who miss the deadline will escape penalty because the fine is linked to the amount of tax owed. If you owe nothing, your fine is nil. A smaller number of people will escape because they have a 'reasonable excuse'. But this has to be serious and outside your control - losing your records in a fire this weekend, for example. Don't blame the post: the Revenue will say you should have sent the return earlier. But some people will find a reprieve in the Steeden v Carver case, a court ruling made last November but given no publicity until this month. It means the strict 31 January deadline is being interpreted in practice as 7.30am on Wednesday. Many tax offices are open today to help with queries. If you want to visit yours, check the opening hours by ringing your office (look under Inland Revenue in the phone book) or by calling the Revenue helpline, on 0645 000 444. Most offices are open tomorrow from 9am to 6pm. Hidden risk A row is brewing over the future make-up of index-tracking unit trusts, which have become hugely popular with small investors. Mega-mergers are creating companies that account for disproportionately large chunks of share indices, particularly the FTSE 100. This means unit trust tracker funds are in danger of breaching rules that require them to hold no more than 10 per cent of a stock because they must mimic the index they follow. Discussions are under way between the industry and the regulator, the Financial Services Authority, over how to address this problem. Investors need not take any action, although some investment advisers are alerting investors to the fact that the increasing concentration of some companies and industries - such as technology - mean that tracker funds carry a higher risk than investors may realise. Jason Hollands of Best Investment and some other commentators want a review of the way the UK's main indices are constructed. Under endowed Insurance company CGU is promising the 600,000 people relying on its endowments to repay their homeloans that it will make good any shortfalls. There is a caveat; CGU will not cough up if average annual returns on its investments work out at less than 6 per cent. However, the company has produced returns well in excess of 6 per cent in the past, so the risk to policyholders now looks small. In another move that should help homeowners, the Council of Mortgage Lenders announced that from 11 February its members will no longer pursue repossessed borrowers for unpaid debts beyond six years, except in cases where proceedings have started. Cars feel the heat Cars are three times more likely to be set on fire and burnt out than they were a decade ago, warns Abbey National's insurance wing. The bank urges people to report abandoned cars to the police since they are easy tar gets for arson and to avoid letting rubbish build up, as it is often set ablaze. Fifty-six per cent of fires in Greater Manchester, Cleveland and West Yorkshire are started deliberately, according to the Home Office. Inching up National Savings is raising some of its interest rates - but not enough to win expert recommendation as a home for savers' money. The cash Isa rate goes up 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent from Tuesday, but is still 1 per cent behind the best, says researcher MoneyFacts.

But he is not going to put his feet up. </p> <p>'On retirement my wife Judith and I plan to visit family in Australia and friends in South Africa,' he says. 'We expect that trip to last three to four months.

But more detailed financial planning is needed for the time after that. Fortunately, Barry has been a member of his present employer's pension scheme since 1984 and when he retires in October, he estimates he will receive a pension of around 42 per cent of his final salary. </p> <p>He was advised to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) which have been his main form of saving. By the time he retires, he expects to have built up an AVC fund of around \u00a360,000. However, he has been given conflicting advice on whether he will be able to take all or part of this amount as his tax-free lump sum at retirement. </p> <p>He is hoping this money will give him enough to buy the narrowboat costing up to \u00a340,000. Running costs will be around \u00a375 per week, excluding other living costs. But he will have other on going financial commitments, including a mortgage linked to an endowment with Scottish Widows that pays out in 10 years' time and a personal loan which has another three years to run. He also has a \u00a31,800 bank overdraft. </p> <p>He hopes to receive a windfall of around \u00a32,500 this summer from the demutualisation of Scottish Widows. He wonders whether to use this money to pay off his personal loan or part of the mortgage.

In deciding which part of his pension provision to commute, key criteria include the level of guaranteed and discretionary increases applying to the main pension. It is likely that he should commute as much of his AVC fund as possible. </p> <p>As to how much tax-free cash he can take, the calculations will depend on whether age 60 is now regarded as his pension scheme's normal retirement age, or whether it is looked upon as early retirement. If it is the latter, he will be able to take tax-free cash of only about \u00a324,000. Even in the best-case scenario, it would be approximately \u00a332,000. </p> <p>As Barry estimates that the narrowboat will cost up to \u00a340,000, I'm not sure that his resources would be sufficient. Maybe he should consider renting a boat rather than buying. </p> <p>Another option would be to remortgage his house to purchase the boat and possibly repay his other loans, as this is relatively low-cost borrowing. But this is a high-risk option. It is a matter of concern that the present mortgage is not due to be repaid until 2010, more than 10 years after his retirement and five years after the state retirement age. </p> <p>In addition, if the house is let to his daughter and she sublets, the income will be hers for tax purposes even if it is paid into Barry's account.

Other people had already asked whether there was a campaign that they could join, and I told Dawn that, if she was serious, we would run another article the following week, including her telephone number. She said she was serious, but now admits: 'I didn't have a clue, but I thought it had to be done.' Now that the campaign has achieved its target, Dawn has to decide what happens next.",

Prices in Marlow, Bucks, have nearly trebled since the M40 brought new employers and commuters in to the area in the early 1990s. </p> <p>These are two examples of places were prices have soared in the past. But is it possible to tell where the hotspots will be in, say, five years' time? The Portman Building Society tips Bournemouth, Falmouth and Cullompton, an old market town in Devon, as three areas on the rise. FPDSavills, the upmarket estate agent, suggests Cambridge, the M4 and M40 corridors, Leeds, Harrogate, Solihull and Edgbaston among others. </p> <p>The main cause of rising property prices is usually local employment. Richard Donnell of FPDSavills says: 'The property market is really a whole series of smaller markets which are driven by their local economies. For the next few years, it will be markets with strong local economies that will do best.' Property prices nationally went up an average of 13 per cent in 1999, according to the Nationwide building society. Leeds, for instance, has been successful in attracting call centres and other kinds of new industry; Cambridge has built itself another hugely successful local jobs market. Both cities are highlighted by the Nationwide Building Society as areas where property price inflation (18 and 27 per cent respectively) is well above the average. </p> <p>Transport links, successful local schools and an Islingtonesque cachet are the other influential factors, says Martin Ellis of the Halifax Bank. 'Access to roads, motorways, airports and stations is very important,' he says. 'And people want to be in a good catchment area for schools. </p> <p>'But the safest bet is an area with a good mix of employers and industry sectors. There is a risk in an area which is dependent on just one big employer, especially if there are difficulties in that industry.' </p> <p>A huge blow would be dealt to the economy of East Kent, for instance, if Pfizer manufacturer of Viagra, decided to pull out of Sandwich. Given the realignments currently taking place in the drugs industry, this kind of move would not be completely surprising. </p> <p>Another factor in the future will be government house-building plans. Figures from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) show that 3.8 million new households need to be constructed by 2021. The location of these new properties will clearly have an effect on supply and demand. The Government is looking closely at encouraging new housing developments along the north Kent coast between London and Faversham, for example. </p> <p>But for these planned properties to be desirable, the government will need to stimulate employment opportunities in economically depressed areas. Similarly, the Government is considering the creation of a 'Millennium Town' for 50,000 inhabitants - a new but different version of Milton Keynes: sites under consideration are near Stansted, Essex, and Ashford, Kent. </p> <p>However, many of the new homes will be in areas that are currently urban - as part of architect Lord Rodgers' planned 'urban renaissance'. The crucial fact here is that 80 per cent of the 3.8 million new homes are expected to be used by single people, according to the DETR. These single people are more likely to want flats in lively locations than the detached and semi-detached houses bought by families. </p> <p>As a consequence, says Donnell: 'We are looking at more high-density urban developments. Big development booms in flats have already started in places such as Bristol, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Most cities are looking at urban regeneration, often by the waterside.' He also predicts a growth in demand for one-person accommodation in towns. </p> <p>Over the past five-, 10- and 15-year periods, property prices have risen faster in Greater London than anywhere else in the country - not least because there is a fixed amount of land and therefore of supply in that area. London prices have risen an average of 83 per cent since 1995, according to the Halifax, compared with a 7 per cent growth in Yorkshire and Humberside, the slowest-moving area. </p> <p> But some smaller areas have seen even faster growth. Banbury in Oxfordshire, for example, which has seen growth of 176 per cent since 1992, has changed from being a small market town with mediocre transport connections to a magnet for a wide range of employers and a favourite with London commuters who find it now takes just over an hour to get to Paddington station. </p> <p>So why did the Portman Building Society pick Falmouth, Bournemouth, and Cullompton as three to watch. Against the background of a buoyant economy and a greater emphasis on leisure, Falmouth is a place that may do well as 'an ideal place for those wanting a second home or seeking to retire in a beautiful area...' and just 10 miles away form the shops of Truro. </p> <p>Bournemouth is also possibly on the up, with its good transport links - including Bournemouth International Airport. Cullompton is typical of many smaller towns which are becoming popular because of the quality of transport, the character of the town, access to shopping and countryside location. </p> <p>Other factors that will increasingly come into play over the next five years include the speeding up of rail connections, allowing a greater commuter hinterland; technological developments which will allow more people to work from home; a greater ability to buy a second home or to live in a beauty spot if you do not need to work in the office; and the growth of short-term contracts, which could see more movement of workers around the country.</p>",

Divisions remained so marked that Andrew Pople of Abbey predicted the possible break-up of the network. He said he could not rule out new restrictions on access to machines. </p> <p>Large banks, such as Abbey and Barclays, argue that they have invested heavily in setting up large networks which are now being exploited by smaller rivals. </p> <p>Nationwide says Barclays is inefficient and stands to draw revenue of \u00a375 million a year from a \u00a31 charge. </p> <p>Pople says the large banks are subsidising new entrants to the market such as the Internet banks. He said: 'The top half a dozen [operators] account for 75 per cent of the network. Each month that passes, the major providers are cross-subsidising the new entrants.' </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, the former telecommunications watchdog who is leading a government inquiry into bank charges, is expected to announce next month that he supports the principle of charges, on condition that they are made clear at the time of withdrawals and capped at 30p. </p> <p>Banks say it would be almost impossible to warn customers on screen of fees to be levied by their own banks, so they favour the host banks taking the charges at the time of the withdrawals instead of the present system in which the money is taken later by a client's own bank. </p> <p>If the banks stick to this position, it appears that in order to fall in line with Cruickshank's proposals all banks and building societies will be forced to come to a new agreement about charges, levying them at machines. </p> <p>Those who want to avoid fees for using that handy machine next to the office belonging to a bank other than their own, will have to stick to their own banks' machines. </p> <p>Nationwide broadly agreed with Cruickshank's line. It would prefer to keep the status quo but if its customers were forced to pay, say, 30p to use a machine outside its network, it would probably refund the money. </p> <p>Abbey's Pople said 30p was too low, and a cap would be anti-competitive. </p> <p>Neil Walkling, principal money researcher at the Consumers' Association doubted the need for charges, and said organisations willing to absorb the fees imposed by other banks should be free to do so. </p> <p>'It's all very well for Barclays to tell us the real cost is more than 30p.

Divisions remained so marked that Andrew Pople of Abbey predicted the possible break-up of the network. He said he could not rule out new restrictions on access to machines. Large banks, such as Abbey and Barclays, argue that they have invested heavily in setting up large networks which are now being exploited by smaller rivals. Nationwide says Barclays is inefficient and stands to draw revenue of \u00a375 million a year from a \u00a31 charge. Pople says the large banks are subsidising new entrants to the market such as the Internet banks. He said: 'The top half a dozen [operators] account for 75 per cent of the network. Each month that passes, the major providers are cross-subsidising the new entrants.' Don Cruickshank, the former telecommunications watchdog who is leading a government inquiry into bank charges, is expected to announce next month that he supports the principle of charges, on condition that they are made clear at the time of withdrawals and capped at 30p. Banks say it would be almost impossible to warn customers on screen of fees to be levied by their own banks, so they favour the host banks taking the charges at the time of the withdrawals instead of the present system in which the money is taken later by a client's own bank. If the banks stick to this position, it appears that in order to fall in line with Cruickshank's proposals all banks and building societies will be forced to come to a new agreement about charges, levying them at machines. Those who want to avoid fees for using that handy machine next to the office belonging to a bank other than their own, will have to stick to their own banks' machines. Nationwide broadly agreed with Cruickshank's line. It would prefer to keep the status quo but if its customers were forced to pay, say, 30p to use a machine outside its network, it would probably refund the money. Abbey's Pople said 30p was too low, and a cap would be anti-competitive. Neil Walkling, principal money researcher at the Consumers' Association doubted the need for charges, and said organisations willing to absorb the fees imposed by other banks should be free to do so. 'It's all very well for Barclays to tell us the real cost is more than 30p. But when Nationwide is saying exactly the opposite, Link must publish independent evidence.'",

      "body": "<p>Thanks to Daewoo, I've a simple answer for when people look at me, baffled, and say: 'What is it you do exactly?' From now on, the rest of the conversation will go like this: </p> <p>'I do social marketing.' </p> <p>'Really? What the hell is that - organising parties?' </p> <p>'No. It's like the new commercial for Daewoo cars. Have you seen it? There's film of a car driving along, and then the voice-over says: \"Because 90 per cent of road accidents are caused by driver error, Daewoo have introduced an important new safety feature in their cars: a free Institute of Advanced Motorists driving course with every car\".' </p> <p>That's social marketing: Daewoo benefits because the promotion will help sell more cars and help differentiate its brand; individual customers benefit because they get free driving lessons; and society benefits because better drivers mean fewer accidents. </p> <p>This new Daewoo initiative works well because it's not overdone. There's not a hint of preaching, or holier-than-thou posturing: the offer of free driving lessons is presented as just another element in the customer package - albeit one that could make a real difference in soci ety. Dorian Leroy, Daewoo's head of marketing, emphasises that the idea for the tie-up with the institute arose from internal discussions about how to add value for customers, rather than any soul-searching about how the company could help make the world a better place. Many Daewoo staff have taken advantage of the offer, so they can talk knowledgeably to customers about the benefits of the lessons, strengthening the overall message and showing that it isn't a one-off marketing scam. </p> <p>For years, we've been used to major car brands assaulting us with their conventional weapons: big-budget brand advertising, and small-scale dealer promotions. So it's refreshing to see a brand such as Daewoo break with the pattern - not only with its safe driving promotion, but with its overall campaign promoting fair prices. </p> <p>In recent days, newspapers have been full of optimistic millennial talk about the ways in which our social values are changing - how it's increasingly all about 'us', not 'me'. </p> <p>The Daewoo campaign, with its neat alignment of individual and collective benefits, is a small but practical example of how the market ing world could help make such grandiose talk a reality. But don't hold your breath. Are we about to witness a flood of campaigns that make use of social solutions to meet marketing objectives? That'll be the Daewoo. </p> <p><strong> Irony sells, Mac</strong><br> There's no way Ted Rodgers is funnier than Nicholas Parsons. No, this isn't the first line of a sub-Tarantino script that's winging its hopeful way round London's more obscure film production companies: I express this (potentially controversial) view about the relative comedic merits of these two game show giants because if you walk down any high street, you'll see each of them pressed into service as a salesman for two of our most famous brands - respectively, McDonald's and Woolworths. </p> <p>But while I maintain that Rodgers is inherently no more amusing than Parsons (if anything, Parsons has the edge), the McDonald's ads, starring the one-time host of 3-2-1 , make me laugh every time. By contrast, Woolworths' campaign, which features Parsons fronting the stores' 'sale of the century', leaves me cold. </p> <p>What's the difference? Both campaigns promote price cuts, both are aimed at a mass market audience, and both rely on has-been celebrities. The answer, as the career of Angus Deayton testifies, is irony - and its use says a lot about the brands behind the two campaigns. Everyone I know who's seen this McDonald's advertising loves it. </p> <p>Appalling TV commercials by DFS and Courts are as much a part of a British New Year as hatred of new in-laws and guilt about elderly relatives.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to Daewoo, I've a simple answer for when people look at me, baffled, and say: 'What is it you do exactly?' From now on, the rest of the conversation will go like this: 'I do social marketing.' 'Really? What the hell is that - organising parties?' 'No. It's like the new commercial for Daewoo cars. Have you seen it? There's film of a car driving along, and then the voice-over says: \"Because 90 per cent of road accidents are caused by driver error, Daewoo have introduced an important new safety feature in their cars: a free Institute of Advanced Motorists driving course with every car\".' That's social marketing: Daewoo benefits because the promotion will help sell more cars and help differentiate its brand; individual customers benefit because they get free driving lessons; and society benefits because better drivers mean fewer accidents. This new Daewoo initiative works well because it's not overdone. There's not a hint of preaching, or holier-than-thou posturing: the offer of free driving lessons is presented as just another element in the customer package - albeit one that could make a real difference in soci ety. Dorian Leroy, Daewoo's head of marketing, emphasises that the idea for the tie-up with the institute arose from internal discussions about how to add value for customers, rather than any soul-searching about how the company could help make the world a better place. Many Daewoo staff have taken advantage of the offer, so they can talk knowledgeably to customers about the benefits of the lessons, strengthening the overall message and showing that it isn't a one-off marketing scam. For years, we've been used to major car brands assaulting us with their conventional weapons: big-budget brand advertising, and small-scale dealer promotions. So it's refreshing to see a brand such as Daewoo break with the pattern - not only with its safe driving promotion, but with its overall campaign promoting fair prices. In recent days, newspapers have been full of optimistic millennial talk about the ways in which our social values are changing - how it's increasingly all about 'us', not 'me'. The Daewoo campaign, with its neat alignment of individual and collective benefits, is a small but practical example of how the market ing world could help make such grandiose talk a reality. But don't hold your breath. Are we about to witness a flood of campaigns that make use of social solutions to meet marketing objectives? That'll be the Daewoo. Irony sells, Mac There's no way Ted Rodgers is funnier than Nicholas Parsons. No, this isn't the first line of a sub-Tarantino script that's winging its hopeful way round London's more obscure film production companies: I express this (potentially controversial) view about the relative comedic merits of these two game show giants because if you walk down any high street, you'll see each of them pressed into service as a salesman for two of our most famous brands - respectively, McDonald's and Woolworths. But while I maintain that Rodgers is inherently no more amusing than Parsons (if anything, Parsons has the edge), the McDonald's ads, starring the one-time host of 3-2-1 , make me laugh every time. By contrast, Woolworths' campaign, which features Parsons fronting the stores' 'sale of the century', leaves me cold. What's the difference? Both campaigns promote price cuts, both are aimed at a mass market audience, and both rely on has-been celebrities. The answer, as the career of Angus Deayton testifies, is irony - and its use says a lot about the brands behind the two campaigns. Everyone I know who's seen this McDonald's advertising loves it. Appalling TV commercials by DFS and Courts are as much a part of a British New Year as hatred of new in-laws and guilt about elderly relatives. So it's a joy to see McDonald's creating an entire national marketing campaign around a spoof January sale. Woolworths' limp and irony-free use of Nicholas Parsons pales by comparison. Of course, you may say: 'Steve, you and your friends are fancy Soho types, media-savvy, marketing-literate and on a different planet from the real world. The ironic McDonald's ads go right over the head of my Nan in Aldershot.' But McDonald's is not a niche brand. In its sector, it's as mass market as Woolworths. And that's why the McDonald's campaign is so brilliant. Even if you don't realise that the ads are a spoof, you're left with the powerful message that McDonald's burgers are cheaper in January. But in the process, McDonald's will have made a whole bunch of new friends. Taken together with their fantastic millennium ad, portraying the delight of a teenager that in a world of change, the hated gherkins in his Big Mac have stayed the same, the marketing chiefs at McDonald's have started the year on a serious high.

      "body": "<p>The idea would have been laughed out of court only a couple of months ago. Yes, Marks &amp; Spencer was in trouble. And yes, there had been a few vague - and largely improbable - suggestions that it might merge with someone else or be taken over. (One fanciful story that did the rounds at M&amp;S's Baker Street head office was that the company was about to merge with Sainsburys). But the notion that the grand old lady of the high street might fall into the clutches of someone such as Philip Green? That was ridiculous. </p> <p>Certainly, Green had a brilliant 1999. Backed by money from the Barclay brothers, he bought the sad remains of the Sears empire for just under \u00a3550 million, and set about taking the company apart and selling its constituent parts. The upshot was that he managed to recover virtually all of his outlay - and keep the \u00a3130m property division. It was a model of how to make money from dismembering a company. </p> <p>But at the heart of the idea that Green could do something similar with M&amp;S lies a huge misconception. There is the small matter of scale, of course: even with its share price languishing at less than \u00a33, M&amp;S is still worth the thick end of \u00a38 billion, which makes it a very different proposition from Sears. There is also the point that trying to buy M&amp;S would be rather like bidding for the Royal Family or saying the Archers might be taken off the air - we might find the company flawed and sometimes exasperating, but it is still something for which the chattering classes feel an enduring affection. </p> <p>But much more fundamentally, Green's record as a retailer is pretty chequered. Certainly, he has made money out of buying and selling retailers and parts of them. But dealing in companies is not the same as running them. </p> <p>Green cannot speak publicly for himself now. For the past six weeks, since he was forced to make a formal Stock Exchange announcement that he was looking at the possibility of bidding for M&amp;S, he has had to keep quiet. But even Green's allies admit that, were M&amp;S to be taken over, no bidder could hope to show a profit simply by breaking up the company. Its assets need to be made to yield a better return, certainly. But they are assets which, even with the chain struggling, are probably worth more under the M&amp;S name than they would be under someone else's. Remember: other retailers scramble to be near an M&amp;S store because it is a magnet for shoppers; take away that magnet, and the value of all retail properties in the area - including the one previously trading as an M&amp;S - will fall. </p> <p>So any bidder would have to think about how better to run M&amp;S, not how to sell its assets. And running retailers is exactly where Green has struggled in the past. He is thought to have approached people such as Allan Leighton of Asda, Terry Green of Debenhams and Richard North of Bass to help tackle M&amp;S - were he to make a bid. But Green's personal history as a retailer is bound to weigh heavily in the minds of any investor being asked to hand control of M&amp;S to the maverick from Monaco. </p> <p>First, look at his successes. In 1985, he paid \u00a365,000 for an option to buy a company called Jean Jeannie. After a few months, the option was sold for \u00a33m. He paid Sears \u00a320m for Olympus Sports in 1995. The business was sold on, yielding a profit of \u00a338m. Green did a further deal with Sears, buying nearly 200 Shoe Express outlets, which he sold later at a hefty, but unquantified profit. Most spectacularly came last year's takeover of Sears itself. </p> <p>But look what has happened when Green has tried to run businesses himself. His very first ventures, set up with his mother, Alma, after Green left Carmel College with no O-levels, were generally flops. One, Cupcraft, went bust in 1982. A clothing importer and wholesaler, Tarbrook, was wound up the following year with debts of more than \u00a3230,000. He was a director of a women's clothing manufacturer, Buzzville, which was half-owned by his mother. It went into voluntary liquidation owing more than \u00a3100,000. And Green was a director of Joan Collins Jeans, formed in 1981. It went under a year later. </p> <p>More recently, Green bought the Owen Owen department store group. The latest accounts, for the year to January 1999, suggest exactly the picture one would associate with him: the company did little more than break even at the operating level; but selling off parts of the operation brought a fat surplus. Overall, pre-tax profits were \u00a31.3m. </p> <p>His fans suggest this is unfair: Olympus was sold on at a profit because its performance improved under Green's control. And Mark One, the clothes retailer he bought after it went bust, is showing like-for-like sales rises of around 20 per cent. </p> <p>But Green's one stint as head of a quoted company, Amber Day, ended with his being ousted after the company failed to meet a profit forecast. His time there started well enough - he joined in 1988, backed with a loan of \u00a3300,000 from Tony Berry of Blue Arrow fame, and using more than \u00a34m of his own. And in 1990 - the year Amber Day moved into discount retailing with the \u00a347m purchase of the What Everyone Wants chain - the company's shares were the market's second-best performer. </p> <p>But there were complaints that Green was running Amber Day as though it was his private concern rather than a listed company. He was mistrusted by the City establishment, and Green went through five firms of stockbrokers in four years. Despite Green's tireless efforts to talk up Amber Day's prospects, the share price fell by two-thirds and he was pushed out in 1992. He was still only 40. </p> <p>Green said the experience had taught him to stick to private companies, and keep out of public ones. 'I was badly bitten on the leg,' he said of the Amber Day episode. 'The scars have finally healed, but I will certainly never be tempted into that world again.' </p> <p> His supporters in the press and in the City felt that he and the company had been the subject of an unpleasant whispering campaign. </p> <p>Suggestions that all wasn't as it seemed at Amber Day were the work of bear raiders, said Green's backers. Certainly, parts of the press were spattered with bearish stories about the company, although these were more than offset by others which supported its performance. </p> <p>But one thing was established as fact: What Everyone Wants (WEW) had bought shares in its parent, Amber Day, in breach of the Companies Act. A firm has to ask shareholders' permission before it buys shares in itself and it must disclose any purchases. Amber Day had done neither. </p> <p>Green's initial explanation was that WEW had bought the shares after Amber Day had first made an approach because it wanted more information on this potential suitor. In fact, WEW continued to buy Amber Day shares after the takeover. Indeed, Companies House documents showed that WEW more than doubled its Amber Day holding after the deal in June 1990. </p> <p>Green said he was unaware of the shareholding. Interest in the share deals evaporated, and no official action was taken. </p> <p>In 1997 Green had to fend off the threat of further bad publicity. He was linked with Helene, the collapsed textiles group, the subject of a Department of Trade investigation. The investigators obtained telephone records showing a number of calls in spring 1997 between Helene's offices and Green's numbers. This was no evidence of any business dealings, said Green; it was just that he was friends with Michael Harris, Helene's former chief. Harris is currently the subject of proceedings to disqualify him as a director. </p> <p>Of course, association with people involved in operations which have proved less than above board is not evidence of wrongdoing. But Green has been unfortunate in his choice of friends. They have included convicted fraudster Roger Levitt and Ted Ball, who headed Landhurst Leasing before it collapsed. Ball was jailed for corruption. In neither case were the convictions anything to do with activities involving Green. </p> <p>None of these friendships should be held against Green. None disqualifies him from being involved in a venture which might bid for M&amp;S. But it is understood that he acknowledges that any bid vehicle he assembles would have to chaired by someone else. The City would seek the reassurance of a well-known worthy at the helm. </p> <p>Even then, could Green put together a successful consortium? He would have to assemble the financing. The Barclay brothers, who bankrolled him for the Sears project, have very publicly declared they will not be involved in any assault on M&amp;S. Given the meagre projections for M&amp;S's operating profits, it is hard to see how even the most optimistic of backers would finance an all-cash deal. </p> <p>An alternative would be an offer which gave M&amp;S shareholders some cash plus a 'stub' of equity, giving them the right to share in any profits from selling off any M&amp;S assets plus a stake in the core business. The perception of how much that core business might be worth, of course, would depend on how much faith investors put in a Green-assembled team. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the phoney war drags on. Green has tried unsuccessfully to have the Takeover Panel demand a statement from Tesco about whether it is interested in bidding for the chain, or would want to buy any M&amp;S stores if they were for sale. Tesco is remaining silent, but there are strong signs that it has very little interest in M&amp;S. . </p> <p>M&amp;S would like Green to be forced either to launch a bid or declare he has dropped the idea. It is hampered in what it can say because it is under threat of a potential offer. It is thought unlikely that M&amp;S will be able to force the issue for at least a further week. </p> <p>Green is apparently keeping the pot boiling by telling friends he thinks he could find the backing for a deal. </p> <p>But as time drags on, his credibility as a potential bidder is starting to diminish. And if a bid does come, it will be the record of Green the retailer, rather than Green the dealmaker that is scrutinised. </p> <p>It is not a great record.</p>",

Green said he was unaware of the shareholding. Interest in the share deals evaporated, and no official action was taken. In 1997 Green had to fend off the threat of further bad publicity. He was linked with Helene, the collapsed textiles group, the subject of a Department of Trade investigation. The investigators obtained telephone records showing a number of calls in spring 1997 between Helene's offices and Green's numbers. This was no evidence of any business dealings, said Green; it was just that he was friends with Michael Harris, Helene's former chief. Harris is currently the subject of proceedings to disqualify him as a director. Of course, association with people involved in operations which have proved less than above board is not evidence of wrongdoing. But Green has been unfortunate in his choice of friends. They have included convicted fraudster Roger Levitt and Ted Ball, who headed Landhurst Leasing before it collapsed. Ball was jailed for corruption. In neither case were the convictions anything to do with activities involving Green. None of these friendships should be held against Green. None disqualifies him from being involved in a venture which might bid for M&amp;S. But it is understood that he acknowledges that any bid vehicle he assembles would have to chaired by someone else. The City would seek the reassurance of a well-known worthy at the helm. Even then, could Green put together a successful consortium? He would have to assemble the financing. The Barclay brothers, who bankrolled him for the Sears project, have very publicly declared they will not be involved in any assault on M&amp;S. Given the meagre projections for M&amp;S's operating profits, it is hard to see how even the most optimistic of backers would finance an all-cash deal. An alternative would be an offer which gave M&amp;S shareholders some cash plus a 'stub' of equity, giving them the right to share in any profits from selling off any M&amp;S assets plus a stake in the core business. The perception of how much that core business might be worth, of course, would depend on how much faith investors put in a Green-assembled team. Meanwhile, the phoney war drags on. Green has tried unsuccessfully to have the Takeover Panel demand a statement from Tesco about whether it is interested in bidding for the chain, or would want to buy any M&amp;S stores if they were for sale. Tesco is remaining silent, but there are strong signs that it has very little interest in M&amp;S. . M&amp;S would like Green to be forced either to launch a bid or declare he has dropped the idea. It is hampered in what it can say because it is under threat of a potential offer. It is thought unlikely that M&amp;S will be able to force the issue for at least a further week. Green is apparently keeping the pot boiling by telling friends he thinks he could find the backing for a deal. But as time drags on, his credibility as a potential bidder is starting to diminish. And if a bid does come, it will be the record of Green the retailer, rather than Green the dealmaker that is scrutinised. It is not a great record.",

The good news from last week's announcement was that the group has got more than expected for the 45 stores it has sold.

      "body": "<p><strong> Sign of the Times for Tory Boy </strong><br> </p> <p> Much excitement at the Times: an internal reshuffle this week saw news editor Ben Preston promoted to deputy editor, and deputy editor John Bryant leave the newspaper. Michael Gove - a dead ringer for Tory Boy - moves from the 'Pop Ed' pages into the news editor's seat. </p> <p>A Times insider said: 'This is clearly the start of the race for an heir apparent.' The strength of the Times ' s news operation in the past year - it broke stories such as Glen Hoddle's howler on disabled people and Michael Portillo's boyish experimentation, pursued Michael Ashcroft and maintained a scatter-gun attack on the interests of new BBC DG Greg Dyke - means that if it doesn't win Newspaper of the Year at the What the Papers Say awards, Media Diary will eat its own shoes. (Call that informed speculation if you like.) </p> <p>What will be intriguing is how Gove will cope with transferring into the world of hard news. Having spent time rehabilitating himself with not only a stint on the Thunderer but also a spell at the Beeb, the skeleton that may yet come back to haunt Gove is his alternative 'debate' show on Channel 4 - A Stab in the Dark . This was an excruciating exercise in making 'yoof' TV relevant, but Gove at least had the good grace to look embarrassed while appearing on The Worst TV Show Ever Made . </p> <p>At the Times his major contribution has been as the man who coaxed Michael Portillo out of the closet and back into politics, but his comment pages have not exactly set the world on fire, and he now has it all to prove. </p> <p>Stand by for 'Portillo helps old lady over road' scoops - and plenty of euro bashing. </p> <p><strong> So farewell then, tipsy Auntie ... </strong><br> </p> <p> It was out with the old at the BBC as Will Wyatt said his farewells last week. He conjured up a charming image of the 'old' BBC, where any meeting at management level after 11am apparently required alcoholic accompaniment. </p> <p>One of the Thatcherite reforms introduced by Duke Hussey was the removal of the drinks trollies from senior editorial staff offices because he, most unreasonably, thought that staff should not be drunk before lunch. </p> <p>Which lead to the punchline 'to prove that in the land of the legless, even the one-legged man is king'. Hussey, of course, having a wooden leg. </p> <p><strong> ...and hello Greg's sad castaways</strong><br> </p> <p> News of the most ambitious 'living television' project to date is leaking from the BBC. Overseen personally by DG Greg Dyke, operation 'Cast Off' will for the first time test the survival skills of TV executives. A handful of specially selected schedulers, commissioners and producers will be cut adrift on the tiny Hebridean island of Talentfree for a year (initially), where they will have to eke out an existence with only an old bender and a sheep to shelter under. The gruelling selection process has already seen BBC1 controller Peter Salmon successfully burn an effigy of Noel Edmonds in a reconstruction of the final scene of The Wicker Man , while news controller Tony Hall and Alan Yentob were last seen bickering about which path to take in the team relay Elsan-emptying exercise. Already booked on the Talentfree trip is the director of Gormenghast, who used four planks and an oil drum to construct a gilded minaret, complete with sinister jackdaws and a malign dwarf. </p> <p><strong> Warm welcome to our hot seat</strong><br> </p> <p> And over at Observer Towers, the Guardian Media Group (owner of this esteemed organ) has a new chairman, Ian Myners, former executive director of NatWest Bank, head of Gartmore Investments, and deputy chairman of PowerGen. </p> <p>We welcome him and are pleased to see, from a cursory sweep of past Observer business pages, that he has not been on the receiving end of a character assassination or indeed a corporate drubbing. </p> <p>In fact, we've always rather liked him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sign of the Times for Tory Boy Much excitement at the Times: an internal reshuffle this week saw news editor Ben Preston promoted to deputy editor, and deputy editor John Bryant leave the newspaper. Michael Gove - a dead ringer for Tory Boy - moves from the 'Pop Ed' pages into the news editor's seat. A Times insider said: 'This is clearly the start of the race for an heir apparent.' The strength of the Times ' s news operation in the past year - it broke stories such as Glen Hoddle's howler on disabled people and Michael Portillo's boyish experimentation, pursued Michael Ashcroft and maintained a scatter-gun attack on the interests of new BBC DG Greg Dyke - means that if it doesn't win Newspaper of the Year at the What the Papers Say awards, Media Diary will eat its own shoes. (Call that informed speculation if you like.) What will be intriguing is how Gove will cope with transferring into the world of hard news. Having spent time rehabilitating himself with not only a stint on the Thunderer but also a spell at the Beeb, the skeleton that may yet come back to haunt Gove is his alternative 'debate' show on Channel 4 - A Stab in the Dark . This was an excruciating exercise in making 'yoof' TV relevant, but Gove at least had the good grace to look embarrassed while appearing on The Worst TV Show Ever Made . At the Times his major contribution has been as the man who coaxed Michael Portillo out of the closet and back into politics, but his comment pages have not exactly set the world on fire, and he now has it all to prove. Stand by for 'Portillo helps old lady over road' scoops - and plenty of euro bashing. So farewell then, tipsy Auntie ... It was out with the old at the BBC as Will Wyatt said his farewells last week. He conjured up a charming image of the 'old' BBC, where any meeting at management level after 11am apparently required alcoholic accompaniment. One of the Thatcherite reforms introduced by Duke Hussey was the removal of the drinks trollies from senior editorial staff offices because he, most unreasonably, thought that staff should not be drunk before lunch. Which lead to the punchline 'to prove that in the land of the legless, even the one-legged man is king'. Hussey, of course, having a wooden leg. ...and hello Greg's sad castaways News of the most ambitious 'living television' project to date is leaking from the BBC. Overseen personally by DG Greg Dyke, operation 'Cast Off' will for the first time test the survival skills of TV executives. A handful of specially selected schedulers, commissioners and producers will be cut adrift on the tiny Hebridean island of Talentfree for a year (initially), where they will have to eke out an existence with only an old bender and a sheep to shelter under. The gruelling selection process has already seen BBC1 controller Peter Salmon successfully burn an effigy of Noel Edmonds in a reconstruction of the final scene of The Wicker Man , while news controller Tony Hall and Alan Yentob were last seen bickering about which path to take in the team relay Elsan-emptying exercise. Already booked on the Talentfree trip is the director of Gormenghast, who used four planks and an oil drum to construct a gilded minaret, complete with sinister jackdaws and a malign dwarf. Warm welcome to our hot seat And over at Observer Towers, the Guardian Media Group (owner of this esteemed organ) has a new chairman, Ian Myners, former executive director of NatWest Bank, head of Gartmore Investments, and deputy chairman of PowerGen. We welcome him and are pleased to see, from a cursory sweep of past Observer business pages, that he has not been on the receiving end of a character assassination or indeed a corporate drubbing. In fact, we've always rather liked him.",

Alex Allan is the UK's first e-envoy, the man charged with transforming Britain into a techno-literate society that is the envy of the world. </p> <p>The tie in question was a mess of blue and vivid red surrounding the Australian flag. Allan was wearing it last week to celebrate Australia Day and to show his affiliation with a country which has become his second home and from which he has only just returned. </p> <p>So, what made a man who rose through the Civil Service ranks to become British High Commissioner to Australia, who previously worked as a computer consultant down under and is married to an Australian artist, want to return to Britain? </p> <p>'I was very keen to do this job. I can't pretend that I didn't experience a pang of regret, but I really believe it's a key job and that I can make a difference. It's a new job and I'm not coming into a role where have to pick up the pieces. What's happening in e-commerce is a key part of the economy. It's hard for the Government to keep pace with the private sector.' </p> <p>This measured response - blending New Labour's evangelism about modernity with a Whitehall mandarin's aversion to verbal pyrotechnics - could be a perfect grade-A answer for anyone sitting Civil Service exams. Asking Allan how he sees his role elicits a similar response: 'The overall theme is pulling all the work the Government's doing in this area together. It's about co-ordinating and focusing everything.' </p> <p>Allan, 48, cites the need to foster the right environment to allow e-commerce to flourish. This encompasses successful implementation of the electronic communications bill, guaranteeing that the UK has the employees to cope with the IT revolution and nurturing talent in schools. Oh yes, and modernising the Government and working with other countries to create international frameworks. </p> <p>Within this daunting remit one area that will command a lot of his time is the taxation of e-commerce transactions. However, he does have some experience in difficult taxation systems. One of his first jobs in the Civil Service was working out how to tax prostitutes and professional safebreakers. </p> <p>He is particularly keen on using new technology to improve cultural links with Europe. 'I think the benefits that can be gained from wiring up schools across Europe - creating more common projects - speak for themselves. One of the crucial areas we need to look at if we are to create an e-Europe is to be found in schools.' </p> <p>Talking about these goals is one thing; achieving them is another. The question is: what powers does Allan have to meet these objectives? Critics of his role wonder whether he has the armoury to cut through bureaucratic red tape and departmental intransigence to ensure that initiatives advance at the pace of commercial change. </p> <p>Allan replies: 'The authority comes ultimately from the fact that Tony Blair has appointed Ian McCartney [the Cabinet Office Minister], Patricia Hewitt [the e-commerce Minister] and me to see that things get done. On the one hand, that means we're going to have a pretty uncomfortable time with Number 10 if things don't get done. On the other hand, it means that if we believe something needs doing and the departments need to work together and that's not being done, he will back us on that.' </p> <p>The Government, Allan says, has 'big ambitions' when it comes to modernising itself. 'It's a very difficult issue. The Government has a lot of work to do to try to take advantage of the new technologies.' </p> <p>Allan's caution is understandable. He has been in the job only three weeks and admits that he has a lot to discover. 'It is about learning. Seeing how other countries do things. But it is also about using my role to get better co-ordination of some government policies.' </p> <p>As part of the learning curve, Allan is keen to talk to the IT community as often as possible. 'This is definitely not a job where I can say I believe I know all the answers. It's a job where you need lots of interaction and feedback.' </p> <p>What does he think about Britain's technological standing? 'There really is a feeling now that this is beginning to take off. I'm quite optimistic that we can get to be the best placed to do e-commerce. We have an economy that's going very well, and we have a good record in adopting some of the new technologies such as mobile phones. We're well positioned as the Internet becomes more diverse.' </p> <p>Allan, who read mathematics at Cambridge and has an MSc in statistics from University College London, is not without high-tech experience. At the Australian High Commission he introduced electronic kiosks to speed up visa and passport applications. His spell as a computer consultant in the Eighties has given him a fresh perspective on the IT world. </p> <p>'I'm a strong believer in it being a bad idea to stay in the same department and not get out at all. I learned a lot from working in the private sector.' Initially, he was with a software consultancy in Sydney and then went to Perth to build telemetry systems for yachts competing in the Americas Cup. He brought his love for sailing back to Britain. His personal website at <a href=\"http://www.whitegum.com\">www.whitegum.com</a> has photographs of Allan windsurfing along the Thames to Whitehall dressed in a pinstripe suit and bowler hat. </p> <p>So the former Under Secretary International Finance (1989-90), Principal Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1986-89), and Principal Private Secretary to John Major (1992-97) is - whisper it quietly in Whitehall's corridors - something of a cybergeek. </p> <p>And not just any old cybergeek, but one with the passion common to those who spend large amounts of time surfing the Net. His mission: to help Internet users learn everything they need to know about US rock band The Grateful Dead. Allan's website has a sophisticated search engine that allows users to type in the names of Grateful Dead songs and learn everything they need to know about the band. Why? </p> <p>'My wife will tell you that it's the most amazing waste of time. I would say that as well as being enjoyable it's actually a good way of learning a bit about things. What you can and can't do. It's quite educative.' </p> <p>Now here's something for the conspiracy theorists. One of the Dead's albums is called Ugly Rumours. That is also the name of the band in which Tony Blair once strutted his stuff. And the Prime Minister heralded Allan's arrival with the recommendation: 'He's one of the few senior civil servants with his own website and he's certainly the only one with a website which has a comprehensive guide to Grateful Dead lyrics.' </p> <p>Grateful Dead fans, incidentally, are called Deadheads.

But on any other scale that's still a fair old stack of crinkling greenies, particularly if it is to be crammed into the pockets of one pair of trousers. </p> <p>Who is the owner of the overstuffed garment in question? Step forward Gerald Levin, head of Time-Warner. This is the amount by which his already well-upholstered Armanis will have to expand if, as he is entitled to do, he chooses to head for the Hamptons when the AOL deal closes, cashing in his 7.5 million (at latest count) share options. Alongside this largesse the full pay he is also entitled to for his contract term is a rounding-up error added to a rounding-up error. </p> <p>The AOL/Time-Warner feeding frenzy is perhaps the most startling manifestation yet of how stock options are changing the way big US companies are managed. Fifteen years ago, points out US compensation expert Graef Crystal, executives fought tooth and nail to prevent takeovers. Today, 'with CEOs owning ... tons of stock option shares, we find your typical CEO walking up and down outside company's headquarters carrying a sandwich board with Company for Sale, Inquire Within on both sides.' </p> <p>Why should an executive stay on if there's that kind of money on a platter? What's more, why should he strive to hoist his company's stock price by years of hard work when by listening to the siren song of Wall Street he can nigh on double it in a day? Expect many more massive mergers, counsels Graef, some making business sense, others not - but all enriching their managers beyond the dreams of Croesus. </p> <p>Mergers aren't the only ploy in the locker of avaricious CEOs. At a time when US share prices are in the clouds and real interest rates are high, firms would normally sell shares to raise cash. Instead, they are borrowing to buy back their shares so that employees can exercise their options. So they puff more air into the over-inflated stock market and increase their vulnerability when the bubble finally bursts. </p> <p>Stock options - which give the beneficiary the right to buy shares in the future at today's prices - were devised to tempt new recruits to start-up firms which couldn't afford high salaries, and to align the interests of the executives who received them with those of shareholders in general. </p> <p>In the first aim they have been a spectacular success. In Silicon Valley, stock options have become a currency with which to pay suppliers and advisers as well as employees. More controversial is their role in large established firms, where the biggest risk these days seems to be not doing a lucrative deal. </p> <p>So enthusiastically have executives rushed to align themselves with shareholders that the average CEO of a large US firm was last year sitting on unrealised stock option profits of $50 million. That's not counting salary, the $8m he (and the occasional she) made by exercising options during the year. According to compensation consultancy Pearl Meyer and Partners, US executives now hold more than 13 per cent (that's $1 trillion) of all outstanding shares and options. </p> <p>But isn't this just the alignment that options were supposed to achieve? Well, as the stock option tail begins to wag the corporate dog, there is now at least prima facie evidence, as in the AOL/TW case above, of conflict of interest. For, as London research unit Smithers points out, the interests of stock- and option-holders are not identical, those of option-holders being typically far more short-term. For proof, look at the alacrity with which companies reduce the purchase price for their executives' share options when the market flinches. Repricing makes nonsense of the alignment claim: ordinary investors don't benefit. </p> <p>The reason stock options loom so large in US pay packets is an accounting cop-out that makes them appear cost-free. Firms do not have to charge the cost of options against profits, as they would with ordinary pay - unless, perversely, there is a performance element to them - but they get tax relief when they are exercised. As investor Warren Buffett has said: 'Accounting principles offer management a choice: pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder that options mushroomed.' </p> <p>The costs that are being ignored are stunning. According to Smithers, if options were treated on a full cost accounting basis, the net profits of 167 of the 200 largest US firms would have been just over a third of what they actually declared in 1998. In the IT sector, this would have turned healthy declared profits into massive losses. The red ink at Microsoft spreads to a mind-blowing $17bn, and at our old friends AOL and Time-Warner it amounts to more than $9bn between them. </p> <p>And do share options incentivise executives to do better? Let's take a look at Apple's Steve Jobs. Since he arrived back at the company in July 1997 he has done an astounding job. The company turned loss into profit and its share price has trebled, yielding a performance at the very top of the US league. </p> <p>So how much was needed to motivate Jobs? He is paid nothing, and he has one share. Said Jobs: 'I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I don't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.' </p> <p>Jobs may not win applause from colleagues for this unusual common sense. But even he has found it impossible to break with custom for ever. This month a grateful Apple board announced it was taking a special charge of $110m against profits - to present Jobs with a jet and a stack of share options. </p> <p>Apple supporters will be hoping this doesn't backfire and motivate him to follow Time-Warner's Levin and seek a partner. </p> <p> simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</p>",

The world lies prostrate before him; endless prosperity and not a cloud in sight, grinned one tanned investment banker. The protests in Seattle and in the City of London are already dismissed as the reaction of 'globophobes' and unrepresentative pressure groups who are trying to deny economic growth to the world's poor. They have no substantial following. The globe is safe for the executive jet and the executive share option in the foreseeable future. It is a degree of self-congratulation that badly needs to be punctured; and almost surely will. Wealth brings an accompanying demand for rights and justice, to hold the powerful to account. The more far-seeing of the thousand or more chief executives here know it; so do the organisers, lamely inviting one or two representatives of Seattle Woman to put their case.

Government guidelines say no one should be left on a trolley for more than four hours. </p> <p>The hospital - which probably has the worst A&amp;E department in Britain - also left a 73-year-old woman with a broken leg on a trolley for 45 hours, and a 56-year-old man with a pulmonary oedema on a trolley for 32 hours. </p> <p>Dr Sam Biggart, a retired GP who checked the hospital, said: 'It was extremely crowded. The sister was very harassed. Staff were really upset there wasn't anything they could do about it.' </p> <p>The checks - carried out by community health councils - reveal similar scenes in many hospitals, although those in the South-East and the outskirts of London are reckoned to be the worst. </p> <p>In King George Hospital in Redbridge, Essex, a 60-year-old man with 'unstable angina' was left on a trolley for 30 hours, and Royal Surrey County Hospital left a 92- year-old man with a head injury on a trolley for 34 hours.

When you have a huge influx of people, you do sometimes get these jams in the A&amp;E department, and we'd had a really, really busy weekend. But it's just not the case that people were lying in corridors not being cared for - they were in cubicles, being attended by nurses and doctors.' The spot check was carried out on 20 December - before the worst of the flu crisis - and Gowan admits the week after was even worse. </p> <p>Gowan blames an acute shortage of staff, which has forced her to close 30 hospital beds. Low pay has left the hospital with a shortage of 350 nurses. </p> <p>The Royal London Hospital, in the East End, boasts it has one of the best A&amp;E departments in the country, but even there people regularly wait more than four hours. Last Thursday it was unusually quiet, but the two dozen patients with minor complaints had to wait for two hours to be seen. An elderly woman in distress - with a suspected heart problem or possibly suffering a stroke - lay on a trolley in the corridor because there was no cubicle free. A middle-aged woman breathing through an oxygen mask had to sit in a chair. At busy times, patients waiting to be seen have to sit on the floor, with sicker ones lying down on the cold lino. Frank Caira, a 62-year-old man with his foot broken in two places, had to wait two hours for treatment last Thursday, but was stoical about it. 'There are people worse than me. You take your turn and wait. It's painful, but it's just pain,' he said. </p> <p>'The waits are abhorrent to us,' insisted Garreth Davies, consultant in charge. ' If you were in a bank or Sains bury's, you'd go mental, but we can't squeeze more out of it without more cash or heavily hitting staff morale.' The nursing staff have to face the brunt of patient anger.Verbal abuse and even physical violence is common. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'Many people strictly defined as waiting are being looked after. We have invested \u00a3115m modernising and rebuilding A&amp;E departments in England, and that's paying dividends.

She longed for what she calls, in this autobiography, 'dry land parts'. She envied Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner the roles they were offered, but most of all, she wanted to do Shakespeare.</p> <p>She found a serious Russian drama coach and showed him the script to a musical she was about to start shooting, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The Russian looked at it with some bemusement. 'How can you sing while you're underwater?' he asked. 'I don't,' Williams replied, 'I sing when I'm on top of the water... But what I want to learn from you is how to perform Portia's speech from The Merchant of Venice.' The man looked at her blankly and sent her away: 'Anyone can do Portia,' he said, 'but I don't know anyone except you who can sing and swim at the same time.'</p> <p>Poor Esther. She was doomed from the moment of her very first screen test, when she was dismissed with the line, 'Get back in the pool'. She claims to regret having told a journalist: 'I know I can't act; I know I can't dance. And I can't sing.' But she needn't feel guilty - audiences would have cottoned on to that even without her own admission. What can't be diminished is her contribution to postwar filmic fantasy, and her endurance as a kitsch icon ever since. While the wounded returned, she emerged from a tank adorned with pink seahorses - smiling, tanned, and perfectly synchronised.</p> <p>Williams came to Tinseltown via the LA Athletic Club. She was a national sprint champion, and blames her ambition on two childhood tragedies: the death of her brother, and her rape by a boy who came to live with the family. From then on, she went through life toughened and undaunted. She was hired to swim alongside Tarzan hero Johnny Weissmuller at San Francisco's World Fair, and was later courted assiduously by MGM studios. 20th Century Fox had made a fortune by using Olympic figure skater Sonja Henie in their movies, and Louis B. Mayer was not to be outdone: 'Melt the ice, get a swimmer, make it pretty!' he is reported to have said.</p> <p>MGM built a $250,000 pool for Williams on Sound Stage 30 ('never had plumbing been put to more glamorous use'), and their efforts paid off. Bathing Beauty, the first movie they shot there, made more money internationally than any film except Gone With the Wind.</p> <p>From then on, the formula was set. All her films had the same plot (geeky boy meets wholesome swimming instructor, and reality gives way to a grand Technicolor finale involving balletic dives, hydraulic seashells, and underwater smiles). Many of them had the same co-star (Van Johnson). And all of them required her to wear the same attire. 'Wait a minute!' Williams thought upon receiving a new script, 'Haven't I already made this movie at least once?'</p> <p>But there was a purpose behind this: by being predictably All-American when to be Un-American was considered a serious crime, Esther Williams fought the Cold War. It was who she was: for Skirts Ahoy! in 1951 she got the US Navy to redesign their official swimsuits so she could star in uniform; when asked what colour scheme she would like for her dressing room she replied, 'red, white and blue'. But even a formula can be infected with hysteria: as time wore on, the stakes in the swimming numbers got higher. Busby Berkeley was enlisted to orchestrate the spectaculars: he had her jumping from trapezes through multicoloured smoke, singing on waterskis and diving from a helicopter.</p> <p>One of the great pleasures of this book is reading about the secrets behind the scenes. Williams (or her co-author, Digby Diehl) has a camp and bitchy twinkle in her turn of phrase.

      "bodyText": "The Million Dollar Mermaid: An Autobiography Esther Williams with Digby Diehl Simon and Schuster \u00a317.99, pp416 Buy it at BOL A few years after she'd made her name as the glamorous swimming star of Hollywood musicals, Esther Williams began to get sick of being typecast. She longed for what she calls, in this autobiography, 'dry land parts'. She envied Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner the roles they were offered, but most of all, she wanted to do Shakespeare. She found a serious Russian drama coach and showed him the script to a musical she was about to start shooting, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The Russian looked at it with some bemusement. 'How can you sing while you're underwater?' he asked. 'I don't,' Williams replied, 'I sing when I'm on top of the water... But what I want to learn from you is how to perform Portia's speech from The Merchant of Venice.' The man looked at her blankly and sent her away: 'Anyone can do Portia,' he said, 'but I don't know anyone except you who can sing and swim at the same time.' Poor Esther. She was doomed from the moment of her very first screen test, when she was dismissed with the line, 'Get back in the pool'. She claims to regret having told a journalist: 'I know I can't act; I know I can't dance. And I can't sing.' But she needn't feel guilty - audiences would have cottoned on to that even without her own admission. What can't be diminished is her contribution to postwar filmic fantasy, and her endurance as a kitsch icon ever since. While the wounded returned, she emerged from a tank adorned with pink seahorses - smiling, tanned, and perfectly synchronised. Williams came to Tinseltown via the LA Athletic Club. She was a national sprint champion, and blames her ambition on two childhood tragedies: the death of her brother, and her rape by a boy who came to live with the family. From then on, she went through life toughened and undaunted. She was hired to swim alongside Tarzan hero Johnny Weissmuller at San Francisco's World Fair, and was later courted assiduously by MGM studios. 20th Century Fox had made a fortune by using Olympic figure skater Sonja Henie in their movies, and Louis B. Mayer was not to be outdone: 'Melt the ice, get a swimmer, make it pretty!' he is reported to have said. MGM built a $250,000 pool for Williams on Sound Stage 30 ('never had plumbing been put to more glamorous use'), and their efforts paid off. Bathing Beauty, the first movie they shot there, made more money internationally than any film except Gone With the Wind. From then on, the formula was set. All her films had the same plot (geeky boy meets wholesome swimming instructor, and reality gives way to a grand Technicolor finale involving balletic dives, hydraulic seashells, and underwater smiles). Many of them had the same co-star (Van Johnson). And all of them required her to wear the same attire. 'Wait a minute!' Williams thought upon receiving a new script, 'Haven't I already made this movie at least once?' But there was a purpose behind this: by being predictably All-American when to be Un-American was considered a serious crime, Esther Williams fought the Cold War. It was who she was: for Skirts Ahoy! in 1951 she got the US Navy to redesign their official swimsuits so she could star in uniform; when asked what colour scheme she would like for her dressing room she replied, 'red, white and blue'. But even a formula can be infected with hysteria: as time wore on, the stakes in the swimming numbers got higher. Busby Berkeley was enlisted to orchestrate the spectaculars: he had her jumping from trapezes through multicoloured smoke, singing on waterskis and diving from a helicopter. One of the great pleasures of this book is reading about the secrets behind the scenes. Williams (or her co-author, Digby Diehl) has a camp and bitchy twinkle in her turn of phrase. The Million Dollar Mermaid is pacily written, and full of good stories too lengthy to retell here - Joan Crawford in a bird outfit, weeping to an imaginary audience; Clark Gable showing up for a screen test, kissing Williams repeatedly and dubbing her a 'mermaid'. Williams reveals the scaffolding behind the glitz: for her underwater scenes her hair had to be drenched in a newly devised concoction of warm baby oil and Vaseline, with false plaits and interlocking hairpins that kept it in place. The usual make-up washed off and floated in the pool, so her entire body was caked in coloured waterproof cream. And one day Esther learned how the studios dealt with older stars.

It turned out that he was covered in little rubber bands which met at the top of his head and were masked by thick foundation: it was an instant face-lift.

She reveals that Johnny Weissmuller had 'remarkable genitalia which he loved to exhibit'. He would 'splash and grunt' as he chased her.

But what is Virago's 100-piece quilt intended to show? Not brilliant careers. </p> <p>The title is as ironic as the novel from which it is taken. In 1901 Stella Maria Sarah Miles Hamilton, under the name of Miles Hamilton, wrote of an unruly Australian tomboy whose mother thought she should have been a boy but whose father said 'the rubbishing conventionalities which are the curse of her sex will bother her soon enough'.</p> <p>If the editors of this collection of a century of women's writing wished to illustrate incipient rebellion against these conventionalities, their extracts for the first decade serve them well. The little girls in E. Nesbit's The Railway Children make flags of their red petticoats to stop a train. Edith Wharton's New York heroine Lily Bart in The House of Mirth coolly contemplates marrying for money. Trembling, the quiet young Scot in Jane and Mary Findlater's novel, Crossriggs, whose brothers and sisters are starving, asks for a man's job (reading to an elderly gentleman) because 'I very much want to earn a little money'.</p> <p>Then the pattern blurs. In these 100 excerpts tweezered from novels and stories published by Virago, are we supposed to be seeing the best of women's writing of the past century? Or fictional illustrations of the social forces ranged against women in each decade? The principle of selection is unclear, the notes inconsistent in their information. Some offer date of first publication, others give no clue.</p> <p>The chronology is particularly puzzling. It is hard to see why a passage has been assigned to a particular year.

      "bodyText": "Brilliant Careers: The Virago Book of Twentieth Century Fiction edited by Ali Smith, Kasia Boddy and Sarah Wood Virago \u00a318.99, pp507 Patchwork is a women's craft in which what matters is not the individual snippets but the pattern that emerges from the ragbag. But what is Virago's 100-piece quilt intended to show? Not brilliant careers. The title is as ironic as the novel from which it is taken. In 1901 Stella Maria Sarah Miles Hamilton, under the name of Miles Hamilton, wrote of an unruly Australian tomboy whose mother thought she should have been a boy but whose father said 'the rubbishing conventionalities which are the curse of her sex will bother her soon enough'. If the editors of this collection of a century of women's writing wished to illustrate incipient rebellion against these conventionalities, their extracts for the first decade serve them well. The little girls in E. Nesbit's The Railway Children make flags of their red petticoats to stop a train. Edith Wharton's New York heroine Lily Bart in The House of Mirth coolly contemplates marrying for money. Trembling, the quiet young Scot in Jane and Mary Findlater's novel, Crossriggs, whose brothers and sisters are starving, asks for a man's job (reading to an elderly gentleman) because 'I very much want to earn a little money'. Then the pattern blurs. In these 100 excerpts tweezered from novels and stories published by Virago, are we supposed to be seeing the best of women's writing of the past century? Or fictional illustrations of the social forces ranged against women in each decade? The principle of selection is unclear, the notes inconsistent in their information. Some offer date of first publication, others give no clue. The chronology is particularly puzzling. It is hard to see why a passage has been assigned to a particular year. Eudora Welty's portrayal of a deaf black orphan boy in Tennessee in 1807 provides a welcome change of focus away from the female, but tells us little about 1943, the year it is slotted to represent. Does Naomi Mitchison's dreadful novel, The Corn King and the Spring Queen, with its pre-Christian earth goddess - 'she ran like a hare, screaming and doubling like a hare' - really illustrate something about the individual and the masses in 1931? Or simply the fertility-rite fantasies of the British left-wing agnostic that ran rampant for decades after Marie Stopes gentrified birth control? Because of the collection's self-limitation - that the extracts come from work published or republished by Virago - many famous names are absent: Mary McCarthy, Alison Lurie and Nadime Gordimer, for example. Even so, it is remarkable how few deal with the massive forces that governed women's lives during the twentieth century. At least Rebecca West's The Return of the Soldier, slotted into 1918, deals with the First World War and Rose Macaulay's Told By An Idiot, assigned to 1923, explicitly talks about women's suffrage and Irish Home Rule. Taken together, however, the selections form a consistent pattern of discontent within the sex cursed or blessed with the double-X chromosome. Worries about marriage, loneliness, joblessness, attractiveness, jealousy of other women, are there, first to last, and above all: 'And then it hit me. He doesn't love me.' (Nora Ephron, 'Heartburn', 1983.) Over the years the smell of antiseptic is never far away, nor is the greed of the abortionist, whether of Rosamond Lehmann's 1936 Harley Street variety or Nell Dunn's 1983 South London backstreets. One fresh new motif - race - does emerge from this collection drawn from examples of women's writing in English around the world. Black women's writing was waiting to be discovered. A memorable contribution from Rosa Guy, a founder of the Harlem Writers' Guild, shows two little Harlem boys forcibly thrown out of Manhattan's Little Italy for trying to shine shoes.

This time, it was a routine meeting which he holds every week with senior MPs on the views of his backbenchers.</p> <p>He was startled to learn that he was facing a Commons revolt, not on this occasion led by the despised 'forces of conservatism' but by a number of New Labour MPs who share Blair's own tolerant views on homosexuality.</p> <p>Blair knew what the forces of conservatism were up to on this issue, and he knew that there were talks taking place through the usual channels to see if the Government could defuse the chorus of outrage from church leaders, the Daily Mail, the Tory frontbench, and a few Labour MPs.</p> <p>Until 2pm on Wednesday, he did not think that any concession to the pro-Section 28 lobby might be seen by his own supporters as an unnecessary surrender to bigotry.</p> <p>The message was reinforced when the Prime Minister made a rare visit to the Lords to address Labour peers, and received a scolding from Baroness Gould, a party veteran.</p> <p>She reminded him that Labour had opposed Section 28 since its introduction, and insisted that peers and MPs should be instructed to vote against it now.</p> <p>The Government's twists and turns began before Christmas, when Education Secretary David Blunkett received a letter from Canon John Hall, secretary of the Board of Education of the Archbishop's Council, warning against 'those powerful groups in our society who are seeking to have homosexual relationships based on exactly the same footing as marriage and family life'.</p> <p>The letter forecast 'profound unease within and beyond the Church of England and Catholic communities' if Section 28 was repealed without being replaced by 'equivalent and robust safeguards' to protect schoolchildren from being taught 'the acceptability of homosexuality'.</p> <p>Blunkett - who once wrote of his 'revulsion' at the thought of sexual contact between men - assured Hall of the Government's 'strong support for marriage and the family.'</p> <p>He had already instructed officials to begin redrafting the Sex and Relationships Circular, which contains the Government's advice to teachers on how to handle sex education.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair must have felt a weight lift from his shoulders when he learnt that last Tuesday night's Commons sittings had gone on so long that Wednesday's business was cancelled, sparing him his gruelling ritual of Prime Minister's Questions. But it is in the nature of his job that as soon as one problem vanishes, another leaps up from whence it is least expected. This time, it was a routine meeting which he holds every week with senior MPs on the views of his backbenchers. He was startled to learn that he was facing a Commons revolt, not on this occasion led by the despised 'forces of conservatism' but by a number of New Labour MPs who share Blair's own tolerant views on homosexuality. Blair knew what the forces of conservatism were up to on this issue, and he knew that there were talks taking place through the usual channels to see if the Government could defuse the chorus of outrage from church leaders, the Daily Mail, the Tory frontbench, and a few Labour MPs. Until 2pm on Wednesday, he did not think that any concession to the pro-Section 28 lobby might be seen by his own supporters as an unnecessary surrender to bigotry. The message was reinforced when the Prime Minister made a rare visit to the Lords to address Labour peers, and received a scolding from Baroness Gould, a party veteran. She reminded him that Labour had opposed Section 28 since its introduction, and insisted that peers and MPs should be instructed to vote against it now. The Government's twists and turns began before Christmas, when Education Secretary David Blunkett received a letter from Canon John Hall, secretary of the Board of Education of the Archbishop's Council, warning against 'those powerful groups in our society who are seeking to have homosexual relationships based on exactly the same footing as marriage and family life'. The letter forecast 'profound unease within and beyond the Church of England and Catholic communities' if Section 28 was repealed without being replaced by 'equivalent and robust safeguards' to protect schoolchildren from being taught 'the acceptability of homosexuality'. Blunkett - who once wrote of his 'revulsion' at the thought of sexual contact between men - assured Hall of the Government's 'strong support for marriage and the family.' He had already instructed officials to begin redrafting the Sex and Relationships Circular, which contains the Government's advice to teachers on how to handle sex education. However, he had also been persuaded that pupils fear being taunted about their sexuality, so the circular will tell teachers that they have an obligation to prevent 'homophobic bullying'. His confidential letter added: 'At the same time, it is imperative that we ensure that no group seeks to proselytise in favour of any particular sexual orientation, using their position to press a particular view on young or vulnerable people.' When the Archbishop of Canterbury issued his warning a week ago about the danger of repealing Section 28, he knew that the Church had a sympathetic listener in the Education Secretary. Last Monday evening, Labour MP Stuart Bell, who represents the General Synod in the Commons, warned that up to 40 Labour MPs agreed with the Archbishop. Faced with questions from lobby journalists, Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell asked Ann Taylor for the view from the whips' office. Based on what she said, he hinted that MPs would be allowed a free vote. The move may have seemed sensible, because the Government was sure of a majority, but by Tuesday opponents of Section 28 began to rally, letting their opinions be known at the weekly MPs' meeting the following day. By Wednesday evening, Section 28's opponents seemed to have won, with Local Government Minister Hilary Armstrong announcing that Campbell had got it wrong. But when the Cabinet met on Thursday, Blunkett quoted his letter to Canon Hall and insisted that his promise to the church leaders must be kept. The week ended in an untidy draw: MPs will be told by the whips to support the Government, but those who disobey are likely to escape unpunished, while teachers will get instructions that this Government believes in marriage and the family.",

      "body": "<p>The departure of gorgeous George Clooney from ER left millions of US viewers under the weather last year. As Clooney moved to a different part of the Warner Bros studio lot to make movies, his loss was keenly felt on the show, ratings even dipped slightly towards the end of last season in the states. </p> <p>The arrival of Goran Visnjic (pronounced Vish-nick), however, has set pulses racing again. Predictably, he's a mysterious, darkly handsome medic; skilled at mending cracked bones and breaking hearts. As Dr Luka Kovic, a Croatian survivor of the Bosnian war, his first few episodes saw him enter Cook County's A&amp;E department with aplomb. </p> <p>In the first episode of the new series on Wednesday, he strides into the ER bearing an injured small girl in his arms. Over the next few weeks viewers will see him inciting a wife-batterer to hit him so the man gets a psychiatric referral; pretending to be a priest to comfort a dying patient and making Nurse Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), last seen lamenting the loss of Clooney, swoon with girlie infatuation. </p> <p>Marguiles knows better than anyone if Visnjic is capable of taking over the heartthrob mantle for which he was obviously hired. 'I have never seen Goran as filling in George Clooney's shoes. Goran fills in his own shoes quite nicely,' she told People magazine. Inspired, the listening journalist later waxed lyrical about his 'Heathcliffian visage'.</p> <p>The six-foot-four Croatian caught the eye of Hollywood after his performance in Michael Winterbottom's Welcome to Sarajevo. He played the war correspondent Stephen Dillane's driver. Director Griffin Dunne spotted him the 1997 US premiere of the film and asked him to audition for the witch comedy Practical Magic. The role of Nicole Kidman's redneck was rewritten for Visnjic as an Eastern European. Back home in Croatia, Visnjic has already enjoyed national fame. He is one of the country's most popular actors, mainly due to his long-running performance as Hamlet at the annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival. His performances won him three national Best Actor Awards. </p> <p>Visnjic's popularity was helped by his pre-fame decision voluntarily to join the Croatian Army in 1991 for a three-month stint -'I felt I had to defend my country, that's normal.' He left to take up his place at Zagreb's Academy of Dramatic Arts. His older brother replaced him. (The army discouraged siblings from serving simultaneously).</p> <p>Visnjic probably holds the unique distinction among putative Hollywood stars of having served in a conflict.

      "bodyText": "The departure of gorgeous George Clooney from ER left millions of US viewers under the weather last year. As Clooney moved to a different part of the Warner Bros studio lot to make movies, his loss was keenly felt on the show, ratings even dipped slightly towards the end of last season in the states. The arrival of Goran Visnjic (pronounced Vish-nick), however, has set pulses racing again. Predictably, he's a mysterious, darkly handsome medic; skilled at mending cracked bones and breaking hearts. As Dr Luka Kovic, a Croatian survivor of the Bosnian war, his first few episodes saw him enter Cook County's A&amp;E department with aplomb. In the first episode of the new series on Wednesday, he strides into the ER bearing an injured small girl in his arms. Over the next few weeks viewers will see him inciting a wife-batterer to hit him so the man gets a psychiatric referral; pretending to be a priest to comfort a dying patient and making Nurse Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), last seen lamenting the loss of Clooney, swoon with girlie infatuation. Marguiles knows better than anyone if Visnjic is capable of taking over the heartthrob mantle for which he was obviously hired. 'I have never seen Goran as filling in George Clooney's shoes. Goran fills in his own shoes quite nicely,' she told People magazine. Inspired, the listening journalist later waxed lyrical about his 'Heathcliffian visage'. The six-foot-four Croatian caught the eye of Hollywood after his performance in Michael Winterbottom's Welcome to Sarajevo. He played the war correspondent Stephen Dillane's driver. Director Griffin Dunne spotted him the 1997 US premiere of the film and asked him to audition for the witch comedy Practical Magic. The role of Nicole Kidman's redneck was rewritten for Visnjic as an Eastern European. Back home in Croatia, Visnjic has already enjoyed national fame. He is one of the country's most popular actors, mainly due to his long-running performance as Hamlet at the annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival. His performances won him three national Best Actor Awards. Visnjic's popularity was helped by his pre-fame decision voluntarily to join the Croatian Army in 1991 for a three-month stint -'I felt I had to defend my country, that's normal.' He left to take up his place at Zagreb's Academy of Dramatic Arts. His older brother replaced him. (The army discouraged siblings from serving simultaneously). Visnjic probably holds the unique distinction among putative Hollywood stars of having served in a conflict. His widely heralded role during the Bosnian war has apparently seeped into the consciousness of ER writers. He's become the M\u008edecin Sans Fronti\u008fres representative at the hospital, charging into wards armed only with his stethoscope and a smile. George couldn't do that, but Gorgeous Goran can. Five things you should know about Goran Visnjic 1 US Vogue magazine recently called him 'the Tom Cruise of Croatia'. 2 Of fame, he says: 'Lots of people want to be movie stars, but they don't realise that to be a celebrity is not that beautiful if you can't go the store and buy toothpaste.' 3 He grew up in a small town on the Adriatic Sea on a heavy diet of American movies. 4 He lives in Los Angeles with his sculptor wife, Ivana. 5 His hobbies are fencing, swimming and diving.",

      "body": "<p>When Eric Nicoli's mobile phone rang on 10 January he was walking down New Bond Street towards his office at EMI. 'I thought you should know,' said his secretary, 'that AOL and Time Warner are merging'.
