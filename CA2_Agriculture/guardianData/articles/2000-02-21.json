The owner hopes it will not be in that order. </p> <p>Financial independence and top-flight football are the priorities in Al Fayed's five-year plan, and the millions he is investing will be wasted if the weekends of entertaining the likes of Walsall are not put behind them quickly. </p> <p>Expectations are running high in SW6, and retaining the loyalties of the home fans, whose number slipped to 9,994 on Saturday, will require a hike in the entertainment on offer. Filling the new 30,000 stadium would be considerably easier in the Premiership. </p> <p>Terry Phelan's 53rd-minute opener was the first goal Fulham have scored in open play for more than 17 hours, and murmurings of discontent at the style of Paul Bracewell's side have come from players and fans alike. Al Fayed's promise yesterday to offer both groups share options when the club are floated may keep them sweet for a little while longer. </p> <p>Fulham remain in the hunt for the play-offs and Bracewell will hope that a final push can prove successful; indeed his job may depend on it. Yet such was Fulham's laboured progression in the first half that Walsall merely had to get men behind the ball to nullify the threat. Darren Wrack missed the visitors' clearest chance when he shot wide when unmarked seven yards out. Bracewell, a softly spoken man, must have put something in the players' half-time cuppa as they came out firing in the second half. Their pressure finally told when Phelan volleyed home Lee Clark's cross. </p> <p>Walsall, whose manager Ray Graydon rightly felt they deserved a point, pressed hard for an equaliser to ease their relegation woes but the substitute Andy Rammell's miss from one yard with his first touch was as close as they came. Clark, having skipped two challenges, stroked home on 84 minutes to keep the Al Fayed masterplan on track.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fulham's grand ambition, overseen by Mohamed Al Fayed, will be manifested in a revamped stadium, a flotation and a place in the Premiership. The owner hopes it will not be in that order. Financial independence and top-flight football are the priorities in Al Fayed's five-year plan, and the millions he is investing will be wasted if the weekends of entertaining the likes of Walsall are not put behind them quickly. Expectations are running high in SW6, and retaining the loyalties of the home fans, whose number slipped to 9,994 on Saturday, will require a hike in the entertainment on offer. Filling the new 30,000 stadium would be considerably easier in the Premiership. Terry Phelan's 53rd-minute opener was the first goal Fulham have scored in open play for more than 17 hours, and murmurings of discontent at the style of Paul Bracewell's side have come from players and fans alike. Al Fayed's promise yesterday to offer both groups share options when the club are floated may keep them sweet for a little while longer. Fulham remain in the hunt for the play-offs and Bracewell will hope that a final push can prove successful; indeed his job may depend on it. Yet such was Fulham's laboured progression in the first half that Walsall merely had to get men behind the ball to nullify the threat. Darren Wrack missed the visitors' clearest chance when he shot wide when unmarked seven yards out. Bracewell, a softly spoken man, must have put something in the players' half-time cuppa as they came out firing in the second half. Their pressure finally told when Phelan volleyed home Lee Clark's cross. Walsall, whose manager Ray Graydon rightly felt they deserved a point, pressed hard for an equaliser to ease their relegation woes but the substitute Andy Rammell's miss from one yard with his first touch was as close as they came. Clark, having skipped two challenges, stroked home on 84 minutes to keep the Al Fayed masterplan on track.",

      "body": "<p>Some three months after his detractors had gleefully pronounced his managerial career at Aston Villa to be over, John Gregory was yesterday sporting the satisfied smile of a vindicated man. </p> <p>Gregory will take nothing for granted but with only Bolton Wanderers of the First Division blocking Villa's route to a first FA Cup final appearance since they won the trophy 43 years ago, the omens are good. The long wait may soon be over. </p> <p>It was close, and Everton's wounds were largely self- inflicted, but Villa deserved to finish on top for they came seeking not a replay but a win and such ambition is worthy of generous reward. </p> <p>\"This is a tremendous result - if hardly a tremendous performance,\" said Gregory. \"The result will kick in over the next 24 hours and only then will we realise what we have achieved. I'm happy with the semi-final draw because if Bobby Robson and Gianluca Vialli had had a choice they, too, would have picked Bolton.\" </p> <p>Perplexingly, in view of Villa's somewhat less that statuesque strike force of Benito Carbone and Julian Joachim, the Everton manager Walter Smith opted to place his faith in a triple centre-back system which in the past has actually served to dilute his side's potential for expansive football. Faced by this unyielding wall of heaving flesh, Villa, rather wisely, kept the ball on the deck and relied upon guile not strength. </p> <p>If the game was always too frantic to paint itself as anything other than fractious, it managed to hold its appeal simply because the devilish pace ensured that the centre of action was constantly on the move. </p> <p>There was a general paucity of chances but then, from nowhere, a goal - followed swiftly by another. </p> <p>Villa struck first. Paul Merson's first contribution proved important as he whipped over a cross from the left after his corner had been played back to him by Carbone. </p> <p>Ugo Ehiogu, standing in splendid isolation at the far post, turned the ball back across goal for Steve Stone to apply the final touch with a diving header, one which bounced and reared up awkwardly in front of Thomas Myhre and found the net off the goalkeeper's body. </p> <p>Everton had lost their way and yet, perversely, at the pre cise moment Villa shaped as if to claim a second goal, they dragged themselves back into the match. </p> <p>Gareth Barry's failure to clear the ball was crucial, permitting Joe-Max Moore to step in and then step forwards. The American's chip-shot from an unsympathetic angle was delicate enough, just, to find its way up and over Peter Enckelman in the Villa goal. </p> <p>Stone did marvellously well to hook the ball away but it was too late; it had crossed the line, a tight decision which Villa took without recourse to histrionics. </p> <p>The first half was living on borrowed time when Villa struck the decisive blow. Having been smartly released by Joachim, Merson ran purposefully forwards before turning right and cutting across the perimeter of the penalty area. His deliberately placed shot was saved but, crucially, not held by Myhre and Carbone could have done a jig of joy before nudging home had he so wished. </p> <p>Thereafter the game sank rather tamely to its knees and declined all invitations to return to its feet.

      "bodyText": "Some three months after his detractors had gleefully pronounced his managerial career at Aston Villa to be over, John Gregory was yesterday sporting the satisfied smile of a vindicated man. Gregory will take nothing for granted but with only Bolton Wanderers of the First Division blocking Villa's route to a first FA Cup final appearance since they won the trophy 43 years ago, the omens are good. The long wait may soon be over. It was close, and Everton's wounds were largely self- inflicted, but Villa deserved to finish on top for they came seeking not a replay but a win and such ambition is worthy of generous reward. \"This is a tremendous result - if hardly a tremendous performance,\" said Gregory. \"The result will kick in over the next 24 hours and only then will we realise what we have achieved. I'm happy with the semi-final draw because if Bobby Robson and Gianluca Vialli had had a choice they, too, would have picked Bolton.\" Perplexingly, in view of Villa's somewhat less that statuesque strike force of Benito Carbone and Julian Joachim, the Everton manager Walter Smith opted to place his faith in a triple centre-back system which in the past has actually served to dilute his side's potential for expansive football. Faced by this unyielding wall of heaving flesh, Villa, rather wisely, kept the ball on the deck and relied upon guile not strength. If the game was always too frantic to paint itself as anything other than fractious, it managed to hold its appeal simply because the devilish pace ensured that the centre of action was constantly on the move. There was a general paucity of chances but then, from nowhere, a goal - followed swiftly by another. Villa struck first. Paul Merson's first contribution proved important as he whipped over a cross from the left after his corner had been played back to him by Carbone. Ugo Ehiogu, standing in splendid isolation at the far post, turned the ball back across goal for Steve Stone to apply the final touch with a diving header, one which bounced and reared up awkwardly in front of Thomas Myhre and found the net off the goalkeeper's body. Everton had lost their way and yet, perversely, at the pre cise moment Villa shaped as if to claim a second goal, they dragged themselves back into the match. Gareth Barry's failure to clear the ball was crucial, permitting Joe-Max Moore to step in and then step forwards. The American's chip-shot from an unsympathetic angle was delicate enough, just, to find its way up and over Peter Enckelman in the Villa goal. Stone did marvellously well to hook the ball away but it was too late; it had crossed the line, a tight decision which Villa took without recourse to histrionics. The first half was living on borrowed time when Villa struck the decisive blow. Having been smartly released by Joachim, Merson ran purposefully forwards before turning right and cutting across the perimeter of the penalty area. His deliberately placed shot was saved but, crucially, not held by Myhre and Carbone could have done a jig of joy before nudging home had he so wished. Thereafter the game sank rather tamely to its knees and declined all invitations to return to its feet. As the skies blackened the better of the openings fell to Villa, although Richard Gough did almost salvage Everton's sea son in the 85th minute with a sweetly driven shot which hit the foot of a post. It was over, but there was still time for Carbone to embroider a deserved reputation for pettiness when he was sent off for a second caution in the last minute, foolishly encroaching at a free-kick after earlier being booked for dissent. \"I think the referee failed to engage his brain - he just reached for a yellow card when he really should have waited a few seconds,\" said Gregory, clearly seeking another appearance before the Football Association's disciplinary panel.",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone was last night holding out against intense pressure to throw his weight behind Frank Dobson's candidacy for elected mayor of London amid widespread dismay at the former health secretary's wafer-thin victory in Labour's electoral college. As Mr Dobson floated the prospect of a job for the former Greater London council leader and some pro-Livingstone unions and activists warned him against the gamble of an independent candidacy, Mr Livingstone denounced the result as \"tainted\" - and kept his options open. With intense support from Tony Blair and the Millbank party machine, Mr Dobson scraped home with 51.53% of the three-sided electoral college against Mr Livingstone's 48.47%, but only after the votes of the third candidate, Glenda Jackson - who won 4.21% of the initial votes - had been redistributed between the frontrunners. The narrowest result in the bitterest internal Labour election since the Tony Benn-Denis Healey deputy leadership fight of 1981 allowed Mr Dobson to demand the support of his beaten rivals in the coming battle against the Tory candidate, Steve Norris, on May 4. \"I stand by the result and I expect other candidates to do what they said they would do,\" Mr Dobson said. Ms Jackson did so even before the ballot results were announced. Mr Livingstone, who stayed at home, renewed his campaign for Mr Dobson to do the \"honourable\" thing and accept that he is too unpopular - and too close to Downing Street - to beat Mr Norris. \"In the interests of uniting the Labour party, I hope Frank Dobson will consider his position over the next few days. He must decide whether he is willing to accept this tainted result or stand down in the interests of Labour and London,\" Mr Livingstone said. But he also urged his supporters - who helped him win the trade union and constituency sections of the electoral college, but not MPs - to \"stay inside the Labour party and fight to ensure this does not happen again\". Some MPs and cabinet ministers took that as a sign that the Brent East MP will draw back from an independent candidacy which some polls say he would win, but which would be bloody and divisive. Last night there were few signs that any prominent figures or unions would court expulsion by endorsing such a run. Geoff Martin, London convenor of Unison - whose members voted by four to one for Mr Livingstone - called for talks to \"salvage\" a dream result for the Tories. \"It would be an absolute disaster if Millbank just continued to plough on regardless and ignored the clear wishes of the vast majority of rank-and-file trade unionists and party members who have given such a clear and ringing endorsement to Ken Livingstone,\" he said. Downing Street, widely blamed for trying to control devolved government yet again, after the battle for Welsh first secretary this time last year, stayed out of the public row, although speculation that Tony Blair will offer Mr Livingstone, 54, a ministerial job is misplaced. Instead, party officials warned that \"the entire party would turn against him\" if he runs, contrary to his promise to abide by the contest's rules. That claim is disputed because of the way some affiliated organisations - the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the south London co-op, in particular, with 8% of the electoral college between them - failed to ballot members. Feeling ran strong that Mr Livingstone had been denied the victory he deserved by the party machine. \"We had to do what we had to do to block him, but from his point of view he won all the votes that could not be fixed,\" one former ally on the left conceded. In the event, Mr Livingstone won both the members' and affiliated union sections, but was beaten by the votes of MPs, MEPs and Greater London assembly candidates. The Brent East MP polled an estimated total of 74,646 votes in all three sections, compared to 22,275 for Mr Dobson and 11,185 for Ms Jackson. In the members' section, the former GLC leader won 19,548 first preference votes to Mr Dobson's 12,559, giving him 59.9% to 40.1% after Ms Jackson's second preferences had been shared out. Mr Livingstone appears to be hoping that the Dobson campaign will quickly flounder amid popular indignation and allow him to step into the breach - much as Rhodri Morgan took over from the hapless Alun Michael as Welsh first secretary.

      "body": "<p>The worst outcome of Labour's London mayoral selection battle, one of Tony Blair's most trusted advisers said privately earlier this month, would be if Frank Dobson won the party's electoral college by less than 5%.</p> <p>Such a result, he suggested, would be a \"political disaster\", because it would put the spotlight on the least heroic aspects of the selection process and give Ken Livingstone the most favourable ground to launch an independent campaign - and potentially split Labour's mayoral vote.</p> <p>The narrowness of the former health secretary's victory yesterday - combined with convincing Livingstone wins in both members' and union ballots - will have realised that aide's worst fears. Mr Dobson's 3% margin leaves the prime minister's nominee vulnerable to accusations of being an illegitimate, \"second choice\" candidate, while the opposition parties crow about \"Alun Michael with a beard\".</p> <p>Even the most committed New Labour enthusiasts find it hard to explain how such a predictable fiasco could have been allowed to happen, in effect in slow motion. Mr Blair was championing an executive mayor for London and other big cities four years ago, and Mr Livingstone's name was floated in the immediate aftermath of Labour's 1997 general election victory.</p> <p>An elementary rule of political management is never to create a post before you have a credible candidate to fill it. Remarkably, in view of the prime minister's reputation as a ruthless control freak, the problem of who should head the Blairite advance guard in London for his brave new world of executive mayors was repeatedly and fatally postponed, while the Livingstone bandwagon gathered speed.</p> <p>A year ago, with London opinion polls giving the former Greater London council leader convincing leads and Mr Livingstone pledging in an open letter to the Guardian to \"work with your government, not against it\", Mr Blair faced an urgent choice: he could take Mr Livingstone at face value and try to come to some accommodation with him, or he could lay the ground to block his candidacy with a determined political onslaught.</p> <p>In fact, Mr Blair did neither. One senior Blair ally insisted yesterday that the prime minister had never regarded it as \"practical or appropriate\" to stop Mr Livingstone from standing. But lower down the hierarchy, it appeared that the Labour leader was incapable of making up his mind. Throughout last year decisions were postponed on who should carry Mr Blair's standard and how and when to run Labour's London selection. More important calls on Mr Blair's attention - Kosovo, Ireland, Iraq - put the looming crisis on the back-burner.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson and the prime minister's political secretary, Sally Morgan, all argued for the Brent East MP to be barred from Labour's official selection process.</p> <p>John Prescott and Philip Gould, Mr Blair's polling adviser, feared a voter and party backlash and pressed for him to be allowed to run - as did Margaret McDonagh, who correctly predicted that Mr Livingstone could be defeated through an electoral college.</p> <p>The decision, when it came, was Mr Blair's. But months of mixed messages helped produce the chaos of November's selection panel meetings, the last-minute catapulting of Mr Dobson into the mayoral fray and the ensuing bitter and divisive campaign.</p> <p>Piling the blame on Millbank may be politically expedient, but as one cabinet minister said yesterday: \"Millbank doesn't take those kind of political decisions.\"</p> <p>The intense campaigning by Mr Dobson's team, backed by Mr Blair and cabinet and parliamentary loyalists, pulled away just enough of Mr Livingstone's lead among party members to do the trick.</p> <p>But the damage to Labour has arguably been worse than in Wales, where Mr Blair's candidate, Alun Michael, was beaten by Rhodri Morgan this time last year in the members' ballot for Welsh first secretary, but won in the MPs' and union sections. Mr Dobson was beaten in both members' and union sections - and almost wherever there was a ballot.</p> <p>Mr Blair's indecision has left him with an open wound in the London Labour party and an increased risk of a Labour defeat in the mayoral poll in May. The party's internal selection process has implicitly come under fire from the Council of Europe, and Mr Blair has been seen to have had to rely on Tammany Hall fixes to get his man selected.</p> <p>But perhaps most dangerous in the long run for Mr Blair's grip on his party may have been the message that it is possible to to be popular without being New Labour. Mr Dobson's victory is likely to prove to have been a Pyrrhic one for the prime minister.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you think Labour's mayoral selection process was fair?

      "bodyText": "The worst outcome of Labour's London mayoral selection battle, one of Tony Blair's most trusted advisers said privately earlier this month, would be if Frank Dobson won the party's electoral college by less than 5%. Such a result, he suggested, would be a \"political disaster\", because it would put the spotlight on the least heroic aspects of the selection process and give Ken Livingstone the most favourable ground to launch an independent campaign - and potentially split Labour's mayoral vote. The narrowness of the former health secretary's victory yesterday - combined with convincing Livingstone wins in both members' and union ballots - will have realised that aide's worst fears. Mr Dobson's 3% margin leaves the prime minister's nominee vulnerable to accusations of being an illegitimate, \"second choice\" candidate, while the opposition parties crow about \"Alun Michael with a beard\". Even the most committed New Labour enthusiasts find it hard to explain how such a predictable fiasco could have been allowed to happen, in effect in slow motion. Mr Blair was championing an executive mayor for London and other big cities four years ago, and Mr Livingstone's name was floated in the immediate aftermath of Labour's 1997 general election victory. An elementary rule of political management is never to create a post before you have a credible candidate to fill it. Remarkably, in view of the prime minister's reputation as a ruthless control freak, the problem of who should head the Blairite advance guard in London for his brave new world of executive mayors was repeatedly and fatally postponed, while the Livingstone bandwagon gathered speed. A year ago, with London opinion polls giving the former Greater London council leader convincing leads and Mr Livingstone pledging in an open letter to the Guardian to \"work with your government, not against it\", Mr Blair faced an urgent choice: he could take Mr Livingstone at face value and try to come to some accommodation with him, or he could lay the ground to block his candidacy with a determined political onslaught. In fact, Mr Blair did neither. One senior Blair ally insisted yesterday that the prime minister had never regarded it as \"practical or appropriate\" to stop Mr Livingstone from standing. But lower down the hierarchy, it appeared that the Labour leader was incapable of making up his mind. Throughout last year decisions were postponed on who should carry Mr Blair's standard and how and when to run Labour's London selection. More important calls on Mr Blair's attention - Kosovo, Ireland, Iraq - put the looming crisis on the back-burner. Gordon Brown, Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson and the prime minister's political secretary, Sally Morgan, all argued for the Brent East MP to be barred from Labour's official selection process. John Prescott and Philip Gould, Mr Blair's polling adviser, feared a voter and party backlash and pressed for him to be allowed to run - as did Margaret McDonagh, who correctly predicted that Mr Livingstone could be defeated through an electoral college. The decision, when it came, was Mr Blair's. But months of mixed messages helped produce the chaos of November's selection panel meetings, the last-minute catapulting of Mr Dobson into the mayoral fray and the ensuing bitter and divisive campaign. Piling the blame on Millbank may be politically expedient, but as one cabinet minister said yesterday: \"Millbank doesn't take those kind of political decisions.\" The intense campaigning by Mr Dobson's team, backed by Mr Blair and cabinet and parliamentary loyalists, pulled away just enough of Mr Livingstone's lead among party members to do the trick. But the damage to Labour has arguably been worse than in Wales, where Mr Blair's candidate, Alun Michael, was beaten by Rhodri Morgan this time last year in the members' ballot for Welsh first secretary, but won in the MPs' and union sections. Mr Dobson was beaten in both members' and union sections - and almost wherever there was a ballot. Mr Blair's indecision has left him with an open wound in the London Labour party and an increased risk of a Labour defeat in the mayoral poll in May. The party's internal selection process has implicitly come under fire from the Council of Europe, and Mr Blair has been seen to have had to rely on Tammany Hall fixes to get his man selected. But perhaps most dangerous in the long run for Mr Blair's grip on his party may have been the message that it is possible to to be popular without being New Labour. Mr Dobson's victory is likely to prove to have been a Pyrrhic one for the prime minister. \u0095 Do you think Labour's mayoral selection process was fair?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement setting out the Government's decisions on the future funding of the BBC. This is a matter that has generated considerable interest, because the BBC is an institution which is central to the United Kingdom's view of itself, and of the world. I want to leave the House in no doubt about the Government's commitment to public service broadcasting and to retaining the BBC at its hub. </p> <p>The BBC is the UK's most important cultural institution, and we have a duty to ensure that it can continue to play a central place in the nation's life. Specifically, the BBC should provide a strong and distinctive schedule of benchmark quality programmes on all its services and should drive the take up of new digital and on-line services.</p> <p>A strong BBC is crucial in ensuring that everyone can have access to information, news, education and current affairs using efficient modern methods, so that we can build a society for the 21st Century on the solid foundations set down for us in the 20th. </p> <p>We welcome the fact that the BBC's main priorities for the next seven years are: improving established services; expanding education work; developing interactive services; and devolution in national and regional broadcasting. We particularly welcome the BBC's intention to re-establish BBC 1 as the Corporation's flagship; its commitment to education, in particular learning support for schools and for life-long learning, and the exploitation of new learning possibilities opened up by interactivity. </p> <p>We also welcome the BBC's plans for enhancing services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, together with a greater regional emphasis within England. It is in order to enable the BBC to deliver these priorities that I am prepared to offer the BBC more support. We shall be keeping the BBC's implementation of these plans closely under review - and ensuring that they keep the commitments that they make in return for that additional support. The BBC must understand the basis of our decision and continue to satisfy Parliament that it can and will deliver. </p> <p>I want to leave you in no doubt that to achieve this vision and to improve its services, the BBC needs to raise its game; it must become even more cost effective and quality conscious. That is why we are not going to allow the BBC the massive injection of funds it has sought from the licence fee - an increase reaching more than \u00a3700m a year by 2006. We are setting it a number of challenges, in terms of sources of finance and in operations. </p> <p>In our consideration of these issues we have been enormously assisted by the work of the Independent Review Panel into the Future Funding of the BBC chaired by Gavyn Davies, which reported last summer. We asked the panel to examine options for providing the BBC with additional funding, assuming that the licence fee remains the principal source of revenue during the current Charter period. </p> <p>The panel was also requested to consider the arrangements under which the BBC achieves a proper balance between its public and commercial services, and the concessionary scheme for pensioners. Broadly speaking, I am today accepting the Panel's analysis, though not, in every respect, the detailed solutions it proposed. </p> <p>The report was published in July 1999 for public consultation. Over 2,000 responses were received. In reaching our decisions, we have taken account of these. I shall shortly be placing a summary of responses in the House Library, and - provided respondents have given permission - the representations by organisations will be made available by my Department's Information Centre, shortly. </p> <p>I have also paid close attention to the Report of the Culture Media and Sport Committee, and, now that I have taken these decisions on the way forward, I will be publishing the Government's response as quickly as possible. </p> <p>I am today placing in the House Library the report of independent consultants, Pannell Kerr Forster, entitled Review of the BBC's Financial Projections, which provided a key input into my decisions on finance, together with my Department's Chief Economist's analysis, and a copy of my letter to the Chairman of the BBC which will set out the detail of this settlement. </p> <p>I shall now deal with the Government's decisions under 4 headings - finance, programming, transparency and licence fee concessions. They provide a balanced package of measures which I hope can be widely welcomed. </p> <p>We accept the judgement of the Davies Panel that our vision for the BBC cannot be realised within the existing funding framework. We agree with them that without the BBC's provision of high quality free-to-air digital services, the penetration of digital TV could end up being capped at around 50-60% of the population. The first place to look for new funding should be self-help by the BBC. </p> <p>New licence fee funding should be secondary. We are therefore providing for an increase in licence fee funding which will raise on average around \u00a3200 million per year between now and 2006. In addition, however, we are challenging the BBC to help themselves by increased efficiency savings, and raising more revenue from their subsidiaries, to the tune of \u00a3490m million by 2006/7, over and above the \u00a3600m which they themselves estimated. </p> <p>This figure presents them with a higher target than that envisaged by the Davies panel - and is in line with the conclusions of the independent analysis of BBC finances which I commissioned. It means that we are demanding over the period of this settlement, that the BBC generates over \u00a31 billion from self-help. As envisaged by the Davies panel, a proportion of the proceeds should be re-invested in the commercial businesses. </p> <p>We will leave it to the BBC how they meet the challenge, but we are leaving the BBC in no doubt that we expect them to achieve the figures set out here - by efficiency savings, partnerships, joint ventures, reductions in bureaucracy, and other means. We believe that the licence fee settlement together with self help should yield enough to ensure that the BBC enhances established services and develops a significant foothold in the digital world. </p> <p>There has been considerable debate on the method of raising additional funding for the BBC. The Review Panel put forward the alternatives of a digital licence fee set at \u00a324, which would fade away' as the normal licence fee rose to meet it; or an increase in the general licence fee payable by all. I have decided not to adopt the new mechanism of a digital supplement payable only by those households with digital TV. Though I accept that there are good arguments for such a solution, on balance, I believe that the benefits of the increased funding will be available to all through improvements in the BBC core services, and, in the case of educational programming also through schools. </p> <p>Furthermore, it is my view that switchover to digital will take place in this decade, so the time has now come to recognise that digital television will soon be the norm. Following my announcement in September, it is now clear that digital switchover can happen sooner than was envisaged by the Davies panel. Against my belief that digital TV brings benefits to all, it would be wrong to signal that it is something special and only for the few. </p> <p>I am therefore going for the general licence fee option, and an increase of 1.5% over RPI in each year, starting in April of this year. This means an increase of 3 pence per week above inflation each year. On 1st April this year the licence fee will rise by \u00a33. It also means that for each \u00a3 the BBC receives from the licence fee, they are expected to generate almost the equivalent through self-help. I will shortly be laying Regulations before the House in relation to the licence fee from 1 April. </p> <p>The Davies panel proposed a package of reforms in the areas of transparency, fair trading and accountability. We support the thrust of the panel's recommendations. In particular, we intend to open up the process by which I approve new BBC proposals and we will also make the BBC's commitment to fair trading more transparent. </p> <p>We are making it clear that we do not expect the licence fee to fund strands of the market, such as dedicated film and sport channels, to which the distinctive role of public service broadcasting has little extra to offer and, more generally, we will institute new procedures for the introduction of new services. This will include an opportunity for public consultation before I reach decisions on proposed new services. We also propose to carry out a programme of reviews of all the current BBC digital services (News 24, Choice, Knowledge and Parliament) to ensure that services are achieving what the BBC assured me they would achieve when I gave approval to them. We propose that a priority for such scrutiny should be News 24. </p> <p>We are going to open the BBC to more external scrutiny. It has, hitherto, been too much the judge and jury in its own cause. I am requiring independent scrutinies of the BBC's fair trading policies and its financial reporting and will publish both scrutiny reports. I shall in addition expect the BBC to have their regular fair trading and financial audits carried out by different auditors in future. </p> <p>The fair trading auditor's full report on compliance and risk will in future be published by the BBC. I will also appoint independent consultants to carry out periodic examinations of the systems and controls in place to ensure fair trading and the nature and extent of financial systems in place. These reports will also be published. </p> <p>All these scrutiny and audit reports will, of course, be available for consideration and questioning by the Select Committee of this House. Finally, we will also be reviewing the public service role and governance of the BBC in the forthcoming Broadcasting and Communications White Paper. </p> <p>This means in essence: <br>\u0095 a review of the governance of the BBC in the forthcoming White Paper; <br>\u0095 clear separation of BBC fair trading and financial audits; <br>\u0095 regular measurement of the BBC's performance against their promises on all new services; <br>\u0095 independent scrutiny of the BBC's financial and fair trading systems and controls; and <br>\u0095 regular reviews of progress in achieving efficiency savings and commercial targets. </p> <p>Turning to concessions, we have already gone beyond the Davies panel's recommendation on assistance for pensioners with the announcement of free licences for the over 75s. I can now announce that we expect the scheme to start on 1 November, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation. From 1 April, those who will be over 75 on 1 November, or who turn 75 after that date, but before their licence would expire, will be able to buy a short term licence, lasting till 1 November. </p> <p>From 1 November, refunds will be available in respect of licences already paid for. I have also asked that the BBC will take steps to ensure that all those reaching their 75th birthday know they are entitled to a free licence, and how to apply. </p> <p>We accept the Davies panel's other recommendations for achieving fairness, and will therefore ensure that there is a half price television licence for blind people; that subtitling of programmes is further developed; and that the Cash Easy Entry easy payment scheme is simplified and made more equitable. </p> <p>There remains the issue of what to do about the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary scheme, which is the main focus of current concessions. Though the majority of the current beneficiaries are over 75 and will receive free licences, there will be about 130,000 pensioners and mentally and physically disabled people left in the scheme. Notwithstanding the drop in the number of people benefiting from the scheme, we propose to keep the existing arrangements for concessionary licences. </p> <p>On concessions, therefore, we are: <br>\u0095 introducing free television licences for the over 75s from 1 November; <br>\u0095 introducing half price television licences for blind people from 1 April; <br>\u0095 setting new targets for subtitling for new BBC digital services; <br>\u0095 simplifying and making more equitable one of the key easy payment schemes; and <br>\u0095 retaining the current Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary scheme. </p> <p>Our key aims throughout have been to ensure accountability, choice, quality, and value for money. I hope the House will agree with me that this is a package from which our constituents will benefit. In return for 3p a week extra on top of the RPI, they will be assured good programming, and good value for money from a BBC that will be able to continue to deliver the quality we expect as the new digital world increasingly becomes a reality. </p> <p>This settlement will, I believe, help to ensure the BBC's position and role as our primary public service broadcaster into the new century. If we are serious about valuing the BBC at its best, and about wanting to keep it at its best, and about ensuring that we all have programmes of real quality to watch in the future, then we must give it the support it needs. This statement will, I hope, give it precisely that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement setting out the Government's decisions on the future funding of the BBC. This is a matter that has generated considerable interest, because the BBC is an institution which is central to the United Kingdom's view of itself, and of the world. I want to leave the House in no doubt about the Government's commitment to public service broadcasting and to retaining the BBC at its hub. The BBC is the UK's most important cultural institution, and we have a duty to ensure that it can continue to play a central place in the nation's life. Specifically, the BBC should provide a strong and distinctive schedule of benchmark quality programmes on all its services and should drive the take up of new digital and on-line services. A strong BBC is crucial in ensuring that everyone can have access to information, news, education and current affairs using efficient modern methods, so that we can build a society for the 21st Century on the solid foundations set down for us in the 20th. We welcome the fact that the BBC's main priorities for the next seven years are: improving established services; expanding education work; developing interactive services; and devolution in national and regional broadcasting. We particularly welcome the BBC's intention to re-establish BBC 1 as the Corporation's flagship; its commitment to education, in particular learning support for schools and for life-long learning, and the exploitation of new learning possibilities opened up by interactivity. We also welcome the BBC's plans for enhancing services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, together with a greater regional emphasis within England. It is in order to enable the BBC to deliver these priorities that I am prepared to offer the BBC more support. We shall be keeping the BBC's implementation of these plans closely under review - and ensuring that they keep the commitments that they make in return for that additional support. The BBC must understand the basis of our decision and continue to satisfy Parliament that it can and will deliver. I want to leave you in no doubt that to achieve this vision and to improve its services, the BBC needs to raise its game; it must become even more cost effective and quality conscious. That is why we are not going to allow the BBC the massive injection of funds it has sought from the licence fee - an increase reaching more than \u00a3700m a year by 2006. We are setting it a number of challenges, in terms of sources of finance and in operations. In our consideration of these issues we have been enormously assisted by the work of the Independent Review Panel into the Future Funding of the BBC chaired by Gavyn Davies, which reported last summer. We asked the panel to examine options for providing the BBC with additional funding, assuming that the licence fee remains the principal source of revenue during the current Charter period. The panel was also requested to consider the arrangements under which the BBC achieves a proper balance between its public and commercial services, and the concessionary scheme for pensioners. Broadly speaking, I am today accepting the Panel's analysis, though not, in every respect, the detailed solutions it proposed. The report was published in July 1999 for public consultation. Over 2,000 responses were received. In reaching our decisions, we have taken account of these. I shall shortly be placing a summary of responses in the House Library, and - provided respondents have given permission - the representations by organisations will be made available by my Department's Information Centre, shortly. I have also paid close attention to the Report of the Culture Media and Sport Committee, and, now that I have taken these decisions on the way forward, I will be publishing the Government's response as quickly as possible. I am today placing in the House Library the report of independent consultants, Pannell Kerr Forster, entitled Review of the BBC's Financial Projections, which provided a key input into my decisions on finance, together with my Department's Chief Economist's analysis, and a copy of my letter to the Chairman of the BBC which will set out the detail of this settlement. I shall now deal with the Government's decisions under 4 headings - finance, programming, transparency and licence fee concessions. They provide a balanced package of measures which I hope can be widely welcomed. We accept the judgement of the Davies Panel that our vision for the BBC cannot be realised within the existing funding framework. We agree with them that without the BBC's provision of high quality free-to-air digital services, the penetration of digital TV could end up being capped at around 50-60% of the population. The first place to look for new funding should be self-help by the BBC. New licence fee funding should be secondary. We are therefore providing for an increase in licence fee funding which will raise on average around \u00a3200 million per year between now and 2006. In addition, however, we are challenging the BBC to help themselves by increased efficiency savings, and raising more revenue from their subsidiaries, to the tune of \u00a3490m million by 2006/7, over and above the \u00a3600m which they themselves estimated. This figure presents them with a higher target than that envisaged by the Davies panel - and is in line with the conclusions of the independent analysis of BBC finances which I commissioned. It means that we are demanding over the period of this settlement, that the BBC generates over \u00a31 billion from self-help. As envisaged by the Davies panel, a proportion of the proceeds should be re-invested in the commercial businesses. We will leave it to the BBC how they meet the challenge, but we are leaving the BBC in no doubt that we expect them to achieve the figures set out here - by efficiency savings, partnerships, joint ventures, reductions in bureaucracy, and other means. We believe that the licence fee settlement together with self help should yield enough to ensure that the BBC enhances established services and develops a significant foothold in the digital world. There has been considerable debate on the method of raising additional funding for the BBC. The Review Panel put forward the alternatives of a digital licence fee set at \u00a324, which would fade away' as the normal licence fee rose to meet it; or an increase in the general licence fee payable by all. I have decided not to adopt the new mechanism of a digital supplement payable only by those households with digital TV. Though I accept that there are good arguments for such a solution, on balance, I believe that the benefits of the increased funding will be available to all through improvements in the BBC core services, and, in the case of educational programming also through schools.

      "body": "<p>A fundamental shift in social attitudes towards race has taken place in the last five years according to an exclusive Guardian/ICM opinion poll published today.</p> <p>The results suggest that the undercurrent of 1960s Powellite racism in British public opinion is finally disappearing. It also provides evidence - even if it is only in what people are willing to tell the pollsters - that the Stephen Lawrence case is proving a watershed in British attitudes towards racism.</p> <p>The poll shows that 53% say most whites would not mind if a close relative married a black or Asian and only 36% say they would mind \"a little or a lot\".</p> <p>In a similar survey in1995, 21% said they \"would not mind\" and 73% said they would mind \"a little or a lot\". Repeated surveys by British Social Attitudes throughout the 1980s and 1990s showed similar large majorities uncomfortable about inter-racial marriage. In 1995, 53% felt most white people would mind having a black or Asian boss at work, against 27% now. Some 63% say that most would not mind compared with 41% five years ago.</p> <p>The poll shows that a year after the publication of the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation, some 75% believe that the police are learning from their mistakes in investigating the death of the black teenager. There is also growing confidence that most officers are not racist, but one in three of the public still believe that the way the police operate, institutional racism leads them to discriminate against blacks and Asians.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview for the Guardian today, home secretary Jack Straw says he regards tackling racism as \"the most important part of my job\". He believes that of all the things he has done while home secretary, setting up the Lawrence inquiry will make the greatest difference. He wants the progress of its implementation to be \"one of the key things I want to be judged on\". He welcomed the poll's results showing that Britain is becoming more relaxed about race but added there was still a long way to go, particularly in employment practices.</p> <p>Surveys by British Social Attitudes in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s repeatedly showed that 75% of the public believed most white people did \"mind a lot or a little\" if a black or Asian person married into their family. That figure is now 36%.</p> <p>The change has also occurred across all age groups - the figure for the over 65s is 34% who thought most white people would object - and social classes, with similar responses among both men and women and Labour and Conservative voters.</p> <p>The commission for racial equality last night welcomed the poll as confirming a decisive change in public opinion . \"There is this sense of a significant and overwhelming shift in public opinion in favour of a diverse society,\" said a CRE spokesman.</p> <p>He said the results represented \"a decisive shift away from the Powellite influence of the 1960s. The cathartic experience of Lawrence has enabled white people to come to terms with living in a multi-racial society. The danger figure is shifting from being a young, black man to the white racist\".</p> <p>ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,205 adults aged over 18 by telephone between February 11-13 2000. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fundamental shift in social attitudes towards race has taken place in the last five years according to an exclusive Guardian/ICM opinion poll published today. The results suggest that the undercurrent of 1960s Powellite racism in British public opinion is finally disappearing. It also provides evidence - even if it is only in what people are willing to tell the pollsters - that the Stephen Lawrence case is proving a watershed in British attitudes towards racism. The poll shows that 53% say most whites would not mind if a close relative married a black or Asian and only 36% say they would mind \"a little or a lot\". In a similar survey in1995, 21% said they \"would not mind\" and 73% said they would mind \"a little or a lot\". Repeated surveys by British Social Attitudes throughout the 1980s and 1990s showed similar large majorities uncomfortable about inter-racial marriage. In 1995, 53% felt most white people would mind having a black or Asian boss at work, against 27% now. Some 63% say that most would not mind compared with 41% five years ago. The poll shows that a year after the publication of the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation, some 75% believe that the police are learning from their mistakes in investigating the death of the black teenager. There is also growing confidence that most officers are not racist, but one in three of the public still believe that the way the police operate, institutional racism leads them to discriminate against blacks and Asians. In an exclusive interview for the Guardian today, home secretary Jack Straw says he regards tackling racism as \"the most important part of my job\". He believes that of all the things he has done while home secretary, setting up the Lawrence inquiry will make the greatest difference. He wants the progress of its implementation to be \"one of the key things I want to be judged on\". He welcomed the poll's results showing that Britain is becoming more relaxed about race but added there was still a long way to go, particularly in employment practices. Surveys by British Social Attitudes in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s repeatedly showed that 75% of the public believed most white people did \"mind a lot or a little\" if a black or Asian person married into their family. That figure is now 36%. The change has also occurred across all age groups - the figure for the over 65s is 34% who thought most white people would object - and social classes, with similar responses among both men and women and Labour and Conservative voters. The commission for racial equality last night welcomed the poll as confirming a decisive change in public opinion . \"There is this sense of a significant and overwhelming shift in public opinion in favour of a diverse society,\" said a CRE spokesman. He said the results represented \"a decisive shift away from the Powellite influence of the 1960s. The cathartic experience of Lawrence has enabled white people to come to terms with living in a multi-racial society. The danger figure is shifting from being a young, black man to the white racist\". ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,205 adults aged over 18 by telephone between February 11-13 2000. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

Then director general Lord Birt lobbied for around two years about the inadequacy of its funding arrangements from 2000 before Mr Smith announced in October 1998 a committee inquiry with the remit of investigating alternative ways of funding the BBC on top of its \u00a32.1bn licence fee revenue.</p> <p>He pledged that the committee would consider all possible methods of boosting the corporation's revenue even as far as the previously unthinkable selling of advertising on its channels, aside from BBC1 and BBC2.

Mr Davies, who had previously floated the idea of a digital licence fee, was a controversial choice to lead the blue sky thinking. As a friend of chancellor Gordon Brown he was dismissed as too close to the government; the commercial broadcasters, vehemently against a digital supplement, argued his mind was already made up. Sure enough, his report recommended a \u00a324 digital supplement for the few million digital households on top of the licence fee, plus the privatisation of the BBC's resources business and the sale of a 49% stake in its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.</p> <p>It was not enough for Lord Birt. He declared Davies' recommendations insufficient to protect the BBC in the new world of global media and claimed it needed an extra \u00a33bn to see its expansion plans through to 2007 - three times the amount budgeted by the Davies panel. Declarations such as these from the BBC served only to rile the department of culture, media and sport, making the job of the alliance of commercial broadcasters to oppose the plans.</p> <p>The subsequent select committee investigating the question, led by Gerald Kaufman was blistering about the BBC's proposals.

His tough prescription of self help for the corporation in over \u00a31bn of enforced savings, which will be regularly checked, has been regarded as long overdue by the BBC's critics. Mr Dyke said: \"We will have tough decisions to make on priorities and on self help. It will be more important than ever to make sure that we are spending our money on the things that really matter - programmes and services for the licence payer.\" There were a few clues for him today in Mr Smith's statement: the BBC is not funded to compete with the commercial broadcasters on sport and films, he said in words which Rupert Murdoch's Sky might have written for him. The BBC must instead focus on its core services, the two main channels and the radio stations, and reinstate BBC1 as the centre of British cultural life. A significant slug of the new cash must be spent on such old-fashioned things as improved programmes for BBC1, BBC2 and the radio stations. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, while cutting \u00a31bn worth of fat from the organisation, will have to open the BBC's strategy to greater scrutiny. Its current digital services, BBC Knowledge, Parliament, Choice and the News 24 will be subject to an immediate review to gauge their success against the public service model of providing something distinctive to the public.

Transport police detective superintendent Nicholas Bracken told the inquest at Westminster Council House in central London that diesel tanks burst into flames when the trains collided, causing the blaze that raged for nearly 40 minutes. Detective Bracken told the nine person jury: \"The collision had a combined speed of 100 mph.\" Fire spread from the front engine car of the Great Western service and from fuel tanks on the Thames train. Britain's worst train disaster in a decade occurred at 8.10am, approximately two miles outside Paddington station, at the Ladbroke Grove junction in west London. The 6.03am Great Western train from Cheltenham, which consisted of an engine car at the front, eight passenger carriages and another power car at the rear, was heading towards London.

As Mr Bracken gave evidence he stood at a specially constructed model of the crash scene, assembled from photographs taken at the time, to explain where the damage had occurred and the directions of the trains. Westminster coroner, Paul Knapman, briefly adjourned the hearing so that relatives of the bereaved could examine the model. They gathered in silence around the model pointing at the different carriages and spoke quietly to each other about what they saw. Earlier, Dr Knapman had warned jurors that they would hear distressing evidence about the tragedy 31 times as each case represented an individual person. Transport police last month said they might scale down their inquiry into the crash because it was unlikely that any individual or company would be charged. The move came after state prosecutors said anyone giving evidence to the inquest would be offered broad immunity from prosecution - except in the case of giving false evidence The October 5 collision - in which 244 were injured - occurred after the driver of the Thames train went through a red light. PC Gavin Cerasale, the first policeman on the scene, said he made for the crash site after seeing a plume of black smoke. \"I jumped out of (my) vehicle and could see the flames and smoke through the security gates in front of me\" at the trackside, he said.

Along with the plethora of awards, one entrant will receive an extended placement on the Guardian, plus \u00a31,000. </p> <p>The judges are as impressive as the winners, including Channel 4 news presenter Jon Snow, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, Mirror editor Piers Morgan, Mark Frith, editor of Heat, Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of lastminute.com, James Brown, founder of Loaded, Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's former adviser, now a sports columnist for the Observer, and comedian Mark Thomas. </p> <p><strong> Andrew Rawnsley</strong><br> <strong> Won:</strong> Student Reporter of Year 82<br> <strong> Now: </strong> political columnist, Observer; presenter, Radio 4 </p> <p><strong> Emily Barr</strong><br> <strong> Won:</strong> Student Reporter of Year 93 <br> <strong> Now:</strong> travel writer, Guardian; writing first book </p> <p><strong> Emily Sheffield</strong><br> <strong> Won:</strong> Student Reporter of Year 95 <br> <strong> Now:</strong> feature writer, Evening Standard </p> <p><strong>Jon Snow introduces the awards:</strong></p> <p>There is no more improbable interface than that between the naturally wayward student and the unrelenting printers' deadline.

Is someone tipping off Mandy's minions? Or, as senior executives fear, is the system being hacked into? Dozens of them are able to access the news machine from home, after all, using security passwords. </p> <p>*Never the best of friends, the Mail and Telegraph spent last week handbagging each other in a spat over who understands women best. Corinna Honan, formerly the Mail's showbiz editor, now the Telegraph's assistant editor, fired the first salvo at \"The Daily Male\" for a spate of articles blaming women for every social ill under the sun and for scoffing at the \"improbable\" relationship between Ralph Fiennes and (50-plus) Francesca Annis. Honan pointed out that the average age of the Mail's women readers is, ahem, 50. The Mail replied with a front page strapline boasting that it's the paper \"that knows what really matters to women\". And it was thrilled to reveal the average age of women Telegraph readers ... 53. </p> <p>*Age is whispered to be very much on the mind of 32-year-old Daily Mail proprietor Viscount (Jonathan) Rothermere, who has discreetly pointed out that those of the paper's key pundits who are not already eligible for a bus-pass soon will be. Keith Waterhouse was 71 last week; the over-55 club also includes Lynda Lee-Potter, Ian Wooldridge, Nigel Dempster, John Edwards and Ann Leslie. The paper's glaring lack of young stars in line to replace them suggests energetic poaching is on the cards. </p> <p>*Naughty Gerald Kaufman. The chairman of the Culture, Media &amp; Sports Select Committee is to hold a one-day hearing provocatively titled Whatever Happened To News At Ten - on March 7, precisely a year after it was axed - and has invited ITV, ITN and the ITC to attend. The growing consensus is that the ITC acted too hastily and will pay in the white paper on communications due this autumn, reallocating regulatory duties. Meanwhile betting at ITN is that the late news will be brought forward, to 10.30pm, up against Newsnight. </p> <p>*Relations between BSkyB and Channel 4 are at rock bottom since the latter niftily trounced Sky for the rights to ER, Friends and the top racecourses. Negotiations have now broken down over the terms for distributing C4's new E4 entertainment network, which will screen ER and Friends when it launches in November, as part of the various Sky subscription packages. The rate per household sought by C4 was about 10 times more than Sky was prepared to pay and was turned down point blank. \"E4 is a basic channel, not a premium one, it's not going to be something that drives subscriptions for us,\" says a Sky insider. And where would it come on the electronic programme guide section listing entertainment networks? \"At the bottom.\" </p> <p>*Preliminary interviews for controller of Radio 4 have just taken place and the smart money appears to be on Anna Carragher, head of broadcasting in Northern Ireland, who has a track record of driving up audiences on Radio Ulster. Interestingly, she has just commissioned a media show for the area, raising hopes that, if she gets the R4 job, the much missed Medium Wave, which was hated by James Boyle, will be reinstated. There is also a push to claim back an extra 15 minutes for The World at One, to be followed at 1.45pm by a news quiz devised by its stalwart presenter, Nick Clarke. </p> <p>*More exclusive news about Robot Wars, BBC2's top-rated programme and the diary's favourite. The BBC has just organised a merchandising deal, so remote control versions of the house robots, Sir Killalot, Sergeant Bash, Mathilda and Shunt, will be ready for Christmas. Is this the show that launched thousands of living room battles?</p> <p>\u0095You can email Maggie Brown at maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com</p>",

Corinna Honan, formerly the Mail's showbiz editor, now the Telegraph's assistant editor, fired the first salvo at \"The Daily Male\" for a spate of articles blaming women for every social ill under the sun and for scoffing at the \"improbable\" relationship between Ralph Fiennes and (50-plus) Francesca Annis. Honan pointed out that the average age of the Mail's women readers is, ahem, 50. The Mail replied with a front page strapline boasting that it's the paper \"that knows what really matters to women\". And it was thrilled to reveal the average age of women Telegraph readers ... 53. *Age is whispered to be very much on the mind of 32-year-old Daily Mail proprietor Viscount (Jonathan) Rothermere, who has discreetly pointed out that those of the paper's key pundits who are not already eligible for a bus-pass soon will be. Keith Waterhouse was 71 last week; the over-55 club also includes Lynda Lee-Potter, Ian Wooldridge, Nigel Dempster, John Edwards and Ann Leslie. The paper's glaring lack of young stars in line to replace them suggests energetic poaching is on the cards. *Naughty Gerald Kaufman. The chairman of the Culture, Media &amp; Sports Select Committee is to hold a one-day hearing provocatively titled Whatever Happened To News At Ten - on March 7, precisely a year after it was axed - and has invited ITV, ITN and the ITC to attend. The growing consensus is that the ITC acted too hastily and will pay in the white paper on communications due this autumn, reallocating regulatory duties. Meanwhile betting at ITN is that the late news will be brought forward, to 10.30pm, up against Newsnight. *Relations between BSkyB and Channel 4 are at rock bottom since the latter niftily trounced Sky for the rights to ER, Friends and the top racecourses. Negotiations have now broken down over the terms for distributing C4's new E4 entertainment network, which will screen ER and Friends when it launches in November, as part of the various Sky subscription packages. The rate per household sought by C4 was about 10 times more than Sky was prepared to pay and was turned down point blank. \"E4 is a basic channel, not a premium one, it's not going to be something that drives subscriptions for us,\" says a Sky insider. And where would it come on the electronic programme guide section listing entertainment networks? \"At the bottom.\" *Preliminary interviews for controller of Radio 4 have just taken place and the smart money appears to be on Anna Carragher, head of broadcasting in Northern Ireland, who has a track record of driving up audiences on Radio Ulster. Interestingly, she has just commissioned a media show for the area, raising hopes that, if she gets the R4 job, the much missed Medium Wave, which was hated by James Boyle, will be reinstated. There is also a push to claim back an extra 15 minutes for The World at One, to be followed at 1.45pm by a news quiz devised by its stalwart presenter, Nick Clarke. *More exclusive news about Robot Wars, BBC2's top-rated programme and the diary's favourite. The BBC has just organised a merchandising deal, so remote control versions of the house robots, Sir Killalot, Sergeant Bash, Mathilda and Shunt, will be ready for Christmas. Is this the show that launched thousands of living room battles? \u0095You can email Maggie Brown at maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com",

      "body": "<p>The story behind the Daily Mail's two-page feature on the mysterious death of film star Natalie Wood in 1981 raises the kind of ethical questions which journalists too rarely ask themselves. Is a journalist ever off-duty? Are the roles of private citizen and journalist compatible? If years pass, can anyone remember what they learned on the record or off? Should journalists really expect to enjoy the same privileges afforded writers of fiction, drawing at will from real-life incidents? </p> <p>The latest Natalie Wood saga began, as so many stories begin, with media hype. The March issue of Vanity Fair magazine boasted that a lengthy article on her death contained \"new clues\" which supposedly cast the tragedy in a very different light from previous accounts. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent accepted the article at face value and filed a news story which repeated claims that Wood had drowned after a \"jealous, drunken row\" with her husband, actor Robert Wagner. Claiming to be based on \"previously unreleased police files and witness statements\", it suggested that the argument was due to Wood flirting with a guest, the actor Christopher Walken. </p> <p>None of this tittle-tattle is novel, as the cuttings files show. Similar allegations surfaced within weeks of Wood's body being fished from the sea off Catalina Island, California, a mile away from the Wagners' yacht. No matter. The \"new evidence\" was justification for the Daily Mail to offer its own retrospective. The day after the Telegraph story, it published a story headlined \"Did booze and jealous rage kill Natalie?\" Written by Glenys Roberts, it had its own gimmick.

      "bodyText": "The story behind the Daily Mail's two-page feature on the mysterious death of film star Natalie Wood in 1981 raises the kind of ethical questions which journalists too rarely ask themselves. Is a journalist ever off-duty? Are the roles of private citizen and journalist compatible? If years pass, can anyone remember what they learned on the record or off? Should journalists really expect to enjoy the same privileges afforded writers of fiction, drawing at will from real-life incidents? The latest Natalie Wood saga began, as so many stories begin, with media hype. The March issue of Vanity Fair magazine boasted that a lengthy article on her death contained \"new clues\" which supposedly cast the tragedy in a very different light from previous accounts. The Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent accepted the article at face value and filed a news story which repeated claims that Wood had drowned after a \"jealous, drunken row\" with her husband, actor Robert Wagner. Claiming to be based on \"previously unreleased police files and witness statements\", it suggested that the argument was due to Wood flirting with a guest, the actor Christopher Walken. None of this tittle-tattle is novel, as the cuttings files show. Similar allegations surfaced within weeks of Wood's body being fished from the sea off Catalina Island, California, a mile away from the Wagners' yacht. No matter. The \"new evidence\" was justification for the Daily Mail to offer its own retrospective. The day after the Telegraph story, it published a story headlined \"Did booze and jealous rage kill Natalie?\" Written by Glenys Roberts, it had its own gimmick. As \"someone who knew her and many of her friends\" in Hollywood 30 years ago, Roberts was able to offer personal insights into Wood's character. It is the nature of this \"inside knowledge\", its provenance and its use, which is so interesting. One of the people Roberts mentioned was Richard Gregson, a film producer and agent, who was married to Wood, and with whom she had a daughter, Natasha. After their divorce, Wood married Wagner for the second time, and Gregson stayed on friendly terms with both. Gregson was outraged by Roberts' article, calling it \"inaccurate and scurrilous\". He felt that she had taken advantage of their \"private\" friendship. She had been indiscreet about \"shared secrets\". He contested her view of Wood as a persistent drunk, and was particularly upset about a key factual omission in one particular anecdote. In her article, Roberts claimed that if Wagner showed even \"polite interest in another woman\", Wood would launch into \"near-suicidal drinking sessions\". Roberts wrote: \"One evening she drank herself into oblivion because another woman was seated next to [Wagner] at a Hollywood dinner. 'He was just being his usual charming self, but she could not bear him talking to anyone else,' the girl told me.' She started drinking and did not know when to stop. 'When she got up from the table to leave, she made a dramatic show of saying goodbye, tripped over and passed out. RJ [Wagner] had to save her from injuring herself.'\" According to Gregson, \"the girl\" was Roberts herself. Not only had she concealed her central role, he claimed, but also failed to mention that she was flirting with Wagner, giving Wood reason to be annoyed. Gregson is convinced that Roberts's piece \"was a pretext for Glenys to unleash personal abuse\" and that she has been guilty of \"talking up 'unknown factors' surrounding Natalie's death because that's what sells newspapers and magazines\". Roberts argues that she was trying to do just the opposite.

Rumours about the brutal nature of the camps the Bosnian Serbs ran had flourished but the ITN story was the first independent evidence of the treatment of inmates. </p> <p>The libel trial will test the credibility of TV news and current affairs, dented by recent scandals. The case will also provide another rallying point for those who believe that Britain's libel laws need reform, amid claims that ITN is trying to use its financial clout to snuff out dissent from a small magazine. Others claim LM's alleged pro-Serbian sympathies led it to attack ITN's veracity. </p> <p>Today, lawyers for ITN and LM will be at the high court for a pre-trial hearing, ahead of next week's trial. The evening before it starts there will be a comedy benefit for LM, cementing the case's status as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The trial will see star correspondents on the stand, with LM having subpoenaed the BBC's world affairs editor John Simpson as a defence witness. </p> <p>The path to the high court started on August 5, 1992. ITN journalists Penny Marshall and Ian Williams went to two camps in northern Bosnia. </p> <p>At the second they filmed the report, transmitted the next day, which featured the image of a starved Alic. The shocking quality of the image was immediately apparent. The Mirror ran the headline \"Belsen '92\". The pictures were shown around the world. In the US, its then most watched evening news broadcast, ABC World News Tonight, introduced ITN's footage by saying: \"The debate over the war in Bosnia Herzegovina today is focusing on those pictures which gave the world its first look at a Serbian-run detention centre.\" </p> <p>Its report said: \"But it was not until words like 'concentration camp' were used that the world's attention was captured and world leaders felt obliged to say something, though not necessarily take action.\" </p> <p>President Bush talked tough about taking action as that one image stoked anxiety about the extent of the horrors in a complex Balkan war few could understand. </p> <p>In 1997 LM ran an article attacking ITN's report under the headline \"the picture that fooled the world\". It was written by Thomas Deichmann, a German freelance. </p> <p>ITN's lawyers have set out what was so objectionable about LM's report. LM, said ITN, claimed that the image was created by \"camera angles and editing\" and \"that there was no barbed wire fence surrounding the camp nor were the refugees in the picture surrounded by barbed wire. It said the camp was a collection centre for refugees, not a prison.\" </p> <p>ITN demanded that the offending issue of LM be pulped and when it was not decided to sue. </p> <p>LM sells around 10-15,000 copies per edition.

Second, it will claim that, whether the article was right or wrong, ITN is wrong to use its commercial might to try and silence a small maverick magazine. LM sees itself as a mouthy David under attack from a broadcasting Goliath. </p> <p>The freedom of speech argument has won support from a host of writers, including Will Self, Margaret Drabble and Doris Lessing. A letter to the Spectator said ITN was \"a major news broadcaster using libel laws to thwart an open press and this has serious implications for journalists\". It was signed by Guardian columnists Roy Greenslade and Charlotte Raven, as well as Auberon Waugh. A letter to the Times deplored ITN's libel suit, saying it was \"yet another example of libel law's chilling effect on free speech\". </p> <p>A signatory to both was the distinguished American linguist and critic of the mass media, Noam Chomsky. He said: \"I supported the right of freedom of speech, not LM. </p> <p>\"If LM's reporting 'dishonoured the suffering of those in the Bosnian war', that's evil.

His master company, News Corporation, was created out of a parochial chain of Australian newspapers inherited from his father and now lays legitimate claim to being one of the world's dominant media enterprises. </p> <p>Yet despite the huge increase in the value of publicly quoted media companies in recent months - boosted initially by the excitement surrounding the merger of AOL and Time Warner and then by the sudden re-rating on the stock exchange of any company with significant control over content - his share price has languished. </p> <p>It must seem so unfair. After all, Murdoch's empire stretches from books to magazines to newspapers to a Hollywood studio. He has 40% of BSkyB, now worth nearly \u00a330bn. His share alone is about \u00a312bn, now a significant proportion of News Corp's total market capitalisation. That seems to suggest that the rest - Fox Studios, Fox Television, satellite companies, control of publisher HarperCollins, etc - isn't worth very much. </p> <p>So many of his separately quoted enterprises - BSkyB and Fox Kids for a start - have seen their share prices soar. BSkyB has seen its share price double since the beginning of the year. And yet the master company is, relatively speaking, treading water. </p> <p>Why? The answer might be that the market is not paying attention to a simple fact: Murdoch has a major network (satellite) through which to pump his considerable content. He has Sky in the UK, a stake in Primestar in the US, Star TV in Asia and Stream in Italy. He also controls a version of the technology that allows satellite signals to be encrypted for the purposes of delivering pay television. </p> <p>The attraction of all this is clear. If you are a major creator of content, whether it be Hollywood films or television series, it is profitable to also control the distribution platforms that ensure the content makes it into homes. Even with the digital revolution, which is meant to make distribution cheaper and content more valuable, it is still a terrific business to own both the content and the distribution. </p> <p>Ask CBS/Viacom, major broadcasters and cable operators, or AOL/Time Warner, which between them will control huge amounts of content, an extensive cable network and a ubiquitous internet portal. Or ask BSkyB, which recently saw its share price soar partly because it decided to embrace new platform potential: by agreeing a joint venture with Kingston Communications to deliver Sky programming via telephone lines in the UK. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Murdoch was convinced that satellite was the right distribution platform. Since then, the received wisdom has evolved: now, satellite is viewed as too clunky, unable to deliver two-way broadband interactivity, and will always be a poor cousin to two-way systems such as cable, high-capacity telephone lines or even wireless. </p> <p>All the same, satellite has taken off. Today in the UK, the biggest digital distribution system is satellite based. Sky has 2.3m satellite subscribers, while digital cable has just 105,000 and ONdigital, the terrestrial rival, is probably in 600,000 homes. Direct-to-home satellite is also big business in Italy, France, Germany, Portugal and Scandinavia, not to mention North America, Asia and India. So if owning content and distribution is important, and if satellite is a worthy distribution platform in its own right, then shouldn't big satellite-owning companies be fully rated by the stock market? Murdoch evidently thinks so. That is why News Corporation confirmed newspaper reports this past week that it was intending to create a new entity that would group all of Murdoch's satellite holdings. The idea is to concentrate the minds of investors: to show them that News Corporation has significant network operations in the form of leading satellite companies. You like strong distribution and content plays, Mr Murdoch seemed to say - then have a look at mine! </p> <p>This underlines the crucial point in News Corp's announcement. Nothing has changed about Murdoch's businesses. Whether the Murdoch empire is structured as a series of partly owned companies, joint ventures, minority stakes or as regrouped publicly listed entities makes no earthly difference to the money he makes. But Murdoch understands that appearances matter. Announce an internet strategy, as radio company GWR did last week, and your share price goes up. Announce that you are going to be a major internet player, as Reed, Reuters and BSkyB have done in recent weeks, and you are rewarded with a huge increase in your share price. Announce that you are a major network operator, as News Corp did by suggesting it would regroup its disparate satellite operations into one entity, and your share price should respond. </p> <p>It makes a rather awkward point about the stock market just now. There is a tendency among corporations to restructure their operations just for show, hoping for the approbation of investors. And, so far, investors are playing along. </p> <p>Look! You hadn't noticed that my company is really an internet play! (So said Reed). Up go the shares. </p> <p>Look! I'm a major content provider, not a provider of commodity financial information! (So said Reuters). Up go the shares. </p> <p>Look!

The great shakeout is not yet upon us. Lastminute.com, a company with no unique market position, is likely to be able to command a flotation price of \u00a3400m. Freeserve, with no ability, as yet, to keep its users captive to its own web pages, can be worth \u00a37bn on the stock market. Companies can still get away with a knee-jerk share price hike when they announce a refocusing on the internet, a new corporate structure, a joint venture with a new media company, a supply deal with a \"dot com\" upstart. </p> <p>But eventually, one day, we will again ask: does it make any money? News Corporation's fiddling of corporate structure is simply a \"me too\" reaction - an effort to attract the market's attention at a time when the market is looking for simple answers. More important will be whether satellite delivery can survive the onslaught of telephony and wireless, and whether News Corporation's control of direct-to-home distribution systems and its own huge stable of content providers (Fox, HarperCollins, the Sun, etc) can see off the competition from behemoths such as Time Warner-AOL or Disney ABC. </p> <p>You can understand Murdoch's frustration, as News Corporation failed to keep up with the re-rating of other companies on the frontier of the new media.

      "bodyText": "It is rare for anyone to feel sorry for Rupert Murdoch. His master company, News Corporation, was created out of a parochial chain of Australian newspapers inherited from his father and now lays legitimate claim to being one of the world's dominant media enterprises. Yet despite the huge increase in the value of publicly quoted media companies in recent months - boosted initially by the excitement surrounding the merger of AOL and Time Warner and then by the sudden re-rating on the stock exchange of any company with significant control over content - his share price has languished. It must seem so unfair. After all, Murdoch's empire stretches from books to magazines to newspapers to a Hollywood studio. He has 40% of BSkyB, now worth nearly \u00a330bn. His share alone is about \u00a312bn, now a significant proportion of News Corp's total market capitalisation. That seems to suggest that the rest - Fox Studios, Fox Television, satellite companies, control of publisher HarperCollins, etc - isn't worth very much. So many of his separately quoted enterprises - BSkyB and Fox Kids for a start - have seen their share prices soar. BSkyB has seen its share price double since the beginning of the year. And yet the master company is, relatively speaking, treading water. Why? The answer might be that the market is not paying attention to a simple fact: Murdoch has a major network (satellite) through which to pump his considerable content. He has Sky in the UK, a stake in Primestar in the US, Star TV in Asia and Stream in Italy.

      "body": "<p>Are the days of the loud-mouthed shock jocks and safe, computerised playlists numbered? Well, commercial radio is certainly looking at itself with an unusually critical eye. It has suddenly realised that unless it broadens listener choice, adds some civilised voices alongside the lads and ladettes, and tones down the drum 'n' bass, it will hand over dominance to the BBC for years to come. A great big niche, the over-44s, has opened up - at the same time as commercial radio is busy concentrating all its fire-power on the under-44s, especially young men. After all, that's what the advertisers dictated during the 1990s. </p> <p>And it is the BBC, with its broad range of output, which is serving this growing over-44 market best, and recruiting them fastest, points out the Radio Advertising Bureau. </p> <p>Demographic change, and a failure to adapt to a greying population, could leave the commercial sector stranded, shrinking rather than expanding. The debate has been focused by the latest Rajar quarterly listening figures, which showed that the BBC has pushed up its audience share convincingly in the October/December period with a 51.3% share compared to 46.7% for commercial radio. This ends the deadlock of the past six years, when the two rivals were level-pegging. </p> <p>The BBC's own predictions five years ago, that its share would fall to around 30%, just haven't come about. And, separately, the Radio Authority, which hands out licences, is concerned that the commercial sector, despite 242 local and regional stations, three national channels and a switch into digital, is out of kilter with the population. It is about to start a major consultation and study covering taste and decency standards, after cracking down hard on offensive broadcasts by London's Xfm and Hallam FM in Yorkshire. </p> <p>\"Older listeners,\" says Jason Bryant, TalkSport's managing director in charge of new development, \"like a more grown-up style of presentation. They want quality news and information, not inane banter, or lists of who's shagging who around the world. There's no doubt that there's a strong market opportunity among the 45-plus age group. Commercial radio doesn't serve that audience.\" </p> <p>This explains why a number of digital radio projects, including those from GWR, Scottish Media Group and Talk's parent, The Wireless Company, are wooing Saga, the company which caters for the over-50s but which failed to win a single commercial radio licence during the 1990s. </p> <p>Last week, Capital Radio launched a new softer national radio format called Life, aimed at women, while One Word Radio (part-owned by the Guardian Media Group) is backing a (commercial) speech network, challenging Radio 4. </p> <p>Ron Coles, heading the Saga Radio push says: \"There's a sense in the last 12 months that there's been a shift in attitude. The over-44s market is so large, it will comprise more than 40% of audiences in 10 years. Traditionally, no one has targeted them, even Classic FM has tried to move towards younger listeners. Yet I get stacks of letters from people objecting to crude speech.\" </p> <p>The key to Saga's format is melodic music: Nat King Cole, Cliff Richard, Elvis, Dr Hook, even Boyzone. \"Not time-warped radio, that's very important. But they just don't want to listen to drum 'n' bass.\" </p> <p>To be fair, the picture is complicated by other factors. Rival stations heap blame for commercial radio's lack of growth on Atlantic 252, the long-wave rock service beamed from Ireland, whose audience has halved in the past five years. Some regional stations with strong local news perform well. </p> <p>And the sparkling exception in this tale of missed opportunities is GWR's Classic FM, which stormed to an audience of more than 6m listeners last year for the first time and has picked up an extra 1.3m regulars in the past four years by smart management and continually adjusting its output. </p> <p>John Pearson, chief executive of Virgin Radio - and a newly minted millionaire thanks to the takeover deal with the Scottish Media Group - argues that the sector is constrained: the BBC, he points out, has the lion's share of best FM frequencies, and it can promote its networks on national television for free. The Radio Authority imposes too tight content restrictions, preventing shifts in tune with audiences - while the BBC can and does change its mix without recourse to anyone: Radio 2 is actually trying to attract younger listeners, Radio 1 is becoming more mainstream, Radio 5 Live outspending Talk Radio for sports rights. </p> <p>But commercial operators have been stuck in a groove, other insiders argue. \"They are totally research-driven and unambitious. They've been unable to come up with fresh, interesting programming to extend their appeal,\" says a senior industry figure. Playlists tend to be restricted to music thought least likely to cause people to switch off. Many of the \"gold\" services, such as Capital Gold, on outmoded AM frequencies, are networked across a number of stations. Some perform weakly. </p> <p>Last year the Radio Authority allowed the greatest relaxation ever: it changed from harnessing companies to promises of performance to a far looser concept of formats. Talk Radio changed with a minimum of fuss to TalkSport, and demonstrated one key problem. </p> <p>For his own business reasons Kelvin MacKenzie decided to appeal almost exclusively to young, sports- mad males. His audience is now two-thirds male, as is Radio 5 Live's. In other words, he kissed goodbye to the middle-aged women who tuned in for broadcasters like Anna Raeburn. Where did those listeners go? Not to commercial radio. Probably to Radio 2 and local BBC radio.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For the Russian authorities, Radio Liberty war correspondent Andrei Babitsky was an irritant they could do without. And so they removed him - in accordance with the old Stalinist dictum: \"No person, no problem.\" Except that in Babitsky's case, the problem refused to disappear along with the person. Instead, the irritant has developed into an international scandal, with the disturbing fate of Babitsky symbolising the worst of Russia's crackdown on media coverage of the war in Chechnya. </p> <p>It has been 37 days since Babitsky last telephoned his wife; since then his voice has only been heard on two sinister videos, of uncertain origin, broadcast on national television. The Russians say he is being held by Chechen guerrillas. His friends, family and employers insist that if he is not already dead, he is in the hands of the FSB - the reorganised KGB. In the space of a few weeks, this man has been transformed from an ordinary news reporter into a dissident martyr, the victim of Russia's new drive to stifle press freedom. </p> <p>Babitsky spent weeks reporting from inside the besieged Chechen capital Grozny for the US-owned radio station, repeatedly contradicting the official Kremlin line on the war. His dispatches gave details of civilian casualties, when Russian officials said that only terrorist bases were being targeted; he reported serious losses among the Russian army, as the military insisted their casualties were minimal; he depicted the plight of thousands of Chechen refugees, while Russia said that there was no humanitarian crisis. </p> <p>With access to the war zone severely restricted, and with most Russian correspondents simply regurgitating official statements from the military headquarters, Babitsky's work soon became dangerously conspicuous. Then, on Jan uary 16, he went missing. For 12 days, Russian authorities said they knew nothing about what had happened to him, before suddenly admitting that he was being held by them in a detention centre in northern Chechnya. </p> <p>At this point, the Russian version of events began to look fuzzy. Some officials said he had been detained because he did not have the correct military accreditation to work in the war zone. Others said it was because he had been working with the rebel enemy. But his alarmed employers at Radio Liberty were reassured by soothing government representatives that a swift release would be organised. </p> <p>This never happened. Instead, the FSB released a video showing a painfully nervous-looking Babitsky being exchanged for two Russian soldiers in a bizarre prisoner swap. The cameras followed the journalist as he walked along a deserted Chechen road towards some masked gunmen, who grabbed him by the shoulder; the film cut off as they began to lead him away. Despite having filmed the transaction, the FSB denied responsibility for it. </p> <p>More alarming still for Babitsky's family was the official response to the exchange - which had the ring of a death sentence. Sergei Yastrzhemsky, the spin doctor newly employed by the Kremlin to \"co-ordinate\" information from the war zone, declared: \"From now on, all federal authorities bear no responsibility for the correspondent's fate.\" </p> <p>Ten days ago, a second video emerged, showing the journalist looking exhausted and frightened. He told the camera that he simply wanted to go home. His family and colleagues regard both pieces of film with supreme scepticism and refuse to take them as evidence that Babitsky is still alive. They say that the prisoner swap was a crude fake, a badly acted piece of theatre designed to shift responsibility for Babitsky's fate onto the Chechens, so that if he were ever found dead, Russia would not be blamed. </p> <p>Chechen warlords have repeatedly denied any involvement in the swap, and Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov has insisted that Babitsky is not in Chechen hands. Even taken at face value, the exchange presents cause for concern. Although they brandished a letter in which Babitsky appeared to give his consent, military officials have never explained the reasoning behind their apparent decision to hand a non-combatant journalist to the enemy. </p> <p>Working in an environment where much is often left unexplained, the Russian press corps has become adept at dreaming up conspiracy theories and there has been no shortage of explanations for what happened to Babitsky. But there is one version which has gained widespread acceptance among those who knew the journalist. </p> <p>They believe that Babitsky knew too much about one aspect of the Russian campaign, and as a consequence became the victim of a bungled silencing attempt by the Russian military - undertaken initially by local officials without sanction from Moscow. As the outcry about his disappearance gained strength, senior officials stepped in to orchestrate an urgent damage-limitation exercise - the apparent prisoner exchange - which in turn backfired disastrously. </p> <p>This is the scenario advocated by Mario Corti, Radio Liberty's representative in Russia. \"Someone didn't like what he was writing and decided to put a stop to it. We don't know if the decision to detain him was taken locally or not, but certainly when it became public knowledge that he was in detention, the central author ities stepped in. I think at this point it was already too late for him to be released.\" </p> <p>Reports have recently emerged that suggest that the journalist was badly beaten at the Chernokosovo detention camp, where he was held for several days in the north of Chechnya. Accounts of the brutal regime within this prison are only gradually emerging, but human rights groups have expressed extreme concern about the conditions in which hundreds of young Chechen men are being held there. \"If Babitsky had been beaten in the prison, it would have been difficult for the military to release him in case he spoke about his treatment and about the conditions there. So they started lying,\" Corti says. </p> <p>He dismisses new reports which emerged last week - from FSB sources - suggesting that Chechen warlords were holding Babitsky prisoner. \"I don't think that the Russians handed him to the Chechens; I think they delivered him to themselves. I'm quite sure that if he is not already dead then he is in the hands of the Russian agencies,\" he says. </p> <p>Maria Eismont, another Russian journalist who reported alongside Babitsky in Grozny but who managed to leave the region safely some weeks earlier, says that if he had really been handed to Chechen rebels he would have telephoned his wife to tell her that he was all right. \"The fighters have access to telephones. At the very least he could have ensured that a message got through to her,\" she says. </p> <p>Babitsky's mysterious disappearance is an extreme example of a strengthening trend of media repression in Russia, but it is not a unique case. Earlier this month, another leading Moscow journalist, Alexander Khinshtein - an investigative reporter who specialised in reporting on Kremlin sleaze - narrowly escaped being consigned to a mental asylum by officials. This throwback to the favoured Stalinist silencing tactic of locking unwanted voices in psychiatric clinics precipitated new waves of alarm. </p> <p>The enormous energy spent by government officials on controlling the flow of news from Chechnya is also symbolic of Russia's new repressive ethos. Negative media coverage of Russia's last war in Chechnya was immensely damaging to the then president Boris Yeltsin. This time, Russia's new premier Vladimir Putin - the former FSB chief who was appointed just before the war broke out - was determined to get it right. Putin has built his presidential ambitions on his tough approach to the war, and has courted supportive coverage of the army's basic mission. At the same time, he has been keen to avoid focus on the campaign's messy details: the casualties and the destruction. </p> <p>From the start, severe restrictions on access to Chechnya were imposed. Journalists were only permitted to visit Russian-controlled areas of the separatist state, and only if they had special military accreditation from the defence ministry. This accreditation was given only to favoured Russian journalists. With one or two exceptions, foreign journalists were excluded from the system. Occasional excursions into the war zone for selected reporters have been set up, but organisers have been so determined to promote the official version of events that these trips have usually been completely surreal. </p> <p>One recent trip saw a group of foreign reporters escorted by the military on a five-day tour of Russian-occupied Chechnya, days after Grozny fell to the Russians after two months of brutal bombardment. On the first day, villagers were brought out to perform traditional Chechen folk dances for the visitors. On day two, journalists were encouraged to inspect and write about the saunas built by Russian soldiers behind the front line. At no point were they allowed to talk freely with civilians, instead they were warned that villagers were under pressure to lie to visiting journalists. </p> <p>\"Finally we were taken to Grozny for a few hours on the last day of the trip, where we managed to talk briefly to some residents about their experiences. As we left the city, our escorts told us that these people had all been paid by the rebels to lie to us. The military seriously expected us to believe this, it was extraordinary,\" says one television reporter. </p> <p>At the beginning of this month, new accreditation was widely distributed as a conciliatory gesture, but access has become no easier. The press officer at Russia's military headquarters in the region, a Colonel Astafiyev, reacts with surprised indignation when foreign journalists suggest a visit to the war zone. \"What's going on here is simply none of your business,\" he says. \"Chechnya is Russia's intimate affair. You wouldn't like it if we demanded to see what you get up to in your bedroom. We don't like you demanding to see what we're doing here.\" </p> <p>Reporters interested in seeing a different side to the campaign have been forced by Russia's strict regulations to seek illicit ways of getting into Chechnya. For some this has involved bypassing the Russian border controls by travelling on foot along dangerous, remote footpaths. Some have resolved the problem by bribing soldiers at checkpoints with a combination of cigarettes, beer, vodka and dollars - distributed according to seniority. Others have resorted to disguise, procuring Chechen-style outfits and travelling with refugees, hoping that their documents will not be scrutinised. </p> <p>Like Babitsky, journalists who travel independently risk immediate arrest if they run into Russian officials within Chechnya. Anne Nivat, a French correspondent, had her satellite telephone, notebooks and documents confiscated when the military found her working in a Chechen village. She was subjected to 12 hours of interrogation by the FSB before being sent back to Moscow. \"The Russians don't want anyone to witness what they are doing there,\" she says. \"They have done everything they can to repress news about this very nasty war.\" </p> <p>But recently, despite this determination to get it right, Russia's heavy-handed propaganda campaign has begun to backfire. News of massacres and widespread human rights abuses has filtered out of the country despite the restrictions; international criticism of Russia's campaign has strengthened. The government is starting to lose the information war. The Kremlin's new Chechnya spokesman, Yastrzhemsky - the former spin doctor to Boris Yeltsin, who built his career on his ability to invent plausible excuses for the former president's frequently bizarre behaviour - now has an even tougher task. At his regular press briefings on the war, he has become reluctant even to discuss the Babitsky question. </p> <p>Friends believe that if the reporter is alive, there is little likelihood of him being released before Russia's presidential elections on March 26. Corti's prognosis for Babitsky's future is bleak. \"Babitsky is the only person who can explain what happened to him. I think the Russians are frightened of what he might tell us. He will only be released when the people who detained him feel certain that he will not speak. That can only be done by returning a Babitsky who is no longer Babitsky.\"</p>",

Corti's prognosis for Babitsky's future is bleak. \"Babitsky is the only person who can explain what happened to him. I think the Russians are frightened of what he might tell us. He will only be released when the people who detained him feel certain that he will not speak. That can only be done by returning a Babitsky who is no longer Babitsky.\"",

The study, produced on behalf of the government's women's unit, has forensically examined pay structures and concluded that sex discrimination is alive and well in the hearts of British managers. This finding overturns the popular view that women are doing as well or better than their male counterparts and only lagging in the pay race because of their \"weakness for children\". At the highest skill level, a woman will earn \u00a3143,000 less than a comparable man in her lifetime even if she has no children. Indeed the having of children (according to the research) will only handicap her by a further \u00a319,000. Further down the skill pecking order, childless women are even more disadvantaged in relation to their male peers and at the same time, the cost of having children, in terms of lifetime earnings, mounts higher. According to Equal Opportunities Commission research, the problem lies with the attitudes of managers who still see men as breadwinners and women as secondary earners who go out to work just to get out of the house. Even those who don't have children will suffer from the expectation that they might become pregnant. So at every stage and age women are tied up in assumptions about the fact that as one manager put it: \"Men are seen as more committed because they don't have a child to go back to.\" Children and caring haunt our employment prospects whatever we do. But it isn't just that. Surveys on families and work show just how much the male identity and ego is focussed on earning. Even a recent study on men as parents showed that they could only identify their contribution to the family in terms of income.

      "body": "<b> The panel:</b> <br> Gary Younge (chair); John Grieve, deputy assistant commissioner, metropolitan police force; Paul Charlton, race and violent crimes task force, metropolitan police; Cristina Odone, deputy editor, New Statesman; Lola Young, school of humanities and cultural studies, Middlesex University; Stephen Thompson, author; Faisal Bodi, news editor of UK Muslim magazine, Q news; Indhu Rubasingham, associate director, Birmingham Rep <p> <b> Gary Younge:</b><br> It seems like it's been quite a difficult year for the police, balancing some of the recommendations Macpherson report with what you would call effective policing. Is that a fair assessment? </p> <p> <b> John Grieve:</b><br> No, that wouldn't be my position. The debate in the police is about effectiveness, about how you get stop-and-search better, what is an acceptable hit rate, what does proportionality mean out on the streets? We must get better at it if we want to keep the power. </p> <p> <b> GY: </b><br> When the crime figures came out it was hinted that one of the reasons certain crimes were not being detected was because there is a sense of self-consciousness among the police when they stop-and-search. </p> <p> <b> JG:</b><br> There are issues about how the police feel about being convicted of institutional racism. But it has never been part of the strategy to have stop-and-search as a tactic. </p> <p> <b> Cristina Odone:</b><br> But the feeling was much more verbalised than that wasn't it? I remember a piece by Tom Utlee saying that Macpherson had blood on his hands because they had demoralised the police force to such an extent that stop-and-search had decreased and the logical consequence of that decrease was an increase in street crime. </p> <p> <b> JG: </b><br> That's an outrageous thing for anybody to say about Sir William Macpherson. </p> <p> <b> Lola Young:</b><br> But there seemed to be a concerted campaign after the report to make a causal link between the diminution of the amount of stop-and-search going on with fears of being accused of racism, and black people being implicated in the majority of street crime. What do you feel about the extent to which that kind of media frenzy plus public awareness folds back into how the police feel about themselves and their role? </p> <p> <b> JG: </b><br> What people expect has shifted quite substantially and the police didn't keep up with that. Is that a reasonable and non-defensive answer to the point you were making? </p> <p> <b> LY:</b><br> Yes, sort of. There is an interesting relationship between how different groups of people see themselves, the way they perceive how other people perceive them and how all that gets played out through the media. </p> <p> <b> Stephen Thompson:</b><br> It's a myth that the black community closes ranks when it comes to stop-and-search. We want to catch criminals like everybody else, but at the same time we don't want a disproportionate level of stopping and searching. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Is there anyone here who would challenge the right of the police to stop someone in the street and ask them questions? </p> <p> <b> LY: </b><br> I wouldn't - but there's an assumption that black youths are up to no good, which is bad. </p> <p> <b> CO:</b><br> Black men are five times as likely to be stopped and searched. In that context, where is the Asian community? </p> <p> <b> Faisal Bodi:</b><br> I don't belong to the Asian community as such. I classify myself as a Muslim; it just happens that the majority of Muslims in this country are of an Asian background. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Is it your feeling that by dwelling on young black men, Macpherson pushes other experiences to the margins? </p> <p> <b> Indhu Rubisingham:</b><br> The report was in specific relation to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, so in that sense I didn't feel marginalised. But there are lots of other issues that other communities experience that are different from the the Afro-Caribbean community. </p> <p> <b> ST: </b><br> I think it's important to put things in an historical context. One of the perceptions of the police is that they're unaccountable, and when it's time for them to be held to account they close ranks. I don't think Macpherson dealt with that. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> One of the solutions that was suggested in the first report was recruitment of more non-white officers. Why do you think young black and Asian people have not gone into the police in the past and what would have to be done to turn that around? </p> <p> <b> LY: </b><br> It's seen as a hostile environment. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Black people generally are twice as likely to be unemployed. There are jobs there, one wonders why they're not taking them. What's stopping them? Perception? Paul, as a black police officer, what do you think? </p> <p> <b> Paul Charlton:</b><br> It's either perception or what they've heard from other people, it's not necessarily something they've experienced themselves. The police have got to be seen by their own actions to be a non-racist service. </p> <p> <b> LY: </b><br> What we have to realise is all services will benefit from equal opportunities. These policies are for everybody, so it's not just about benefits that accrue to black people. We want a police service that solves crime, we want an education system that educates people. You talk about employment, but what employment prospects are there for black boys who are excluded from classrooms across the country? </p> <p> <b> ST: </b><br> The thing is, positive discrimination doesn't work in the end because we become stigmatised as not worthy and are told we are only there because of the colour of our skin. There's a lot of tokenism involved that only serves to make those people who implement those policies feel better about themselves. </p> <p> <b> LY:</b><br> Somebody has to open the door for you slightly, but once you're in it comes down to merit. But we must recognise that there are glass ceilings. </p> <p> <b> FB:</b><br> Yes, but we've got to be wary about playing the colours game. Having the right colours in the relevant place in the higher positions doesn't achieve anything. All you're going to get is recriminations and a possible backlash. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Yes, but black people do want jobs and they aren't getting them in larger numbers than white people, which would suggest that there is some mismatch between aspiration and attainment. </p> <p> <b> LY:</b><br> It's very easy for us to make generalisations, but we need to think about these things not only in terms of race but class and gender as well. Let's not also forget about the dire performance in schools of white working class boys. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> One of the ways in which current debates on race are interestingly skewed is that black people talk about their experiences of being black, white people never talk about their experiences of being white. </p> <p> <b> JG: </b><br> In terms of being a white, middle class, middle aged cop, Macpherson was a deeply shocking and shaming experience. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Paul, were you shocked when they came up with institutional racism? </p> <p> <b> PC: </b><br> No, I can't say I was. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> So what have your experiences been in the police service? </p> <p> <b> PC: </b><br> You do have things happen to you from time to time, but it's not a huge catalogue. I've been stopped in my own station before and asked for ID in uniform. I've been stopped driving an unmarked police car and had the keys taken out of the ignition by a police officer who asked me to get out of the car, knowing that no radio check had been done on the car. One of the most embarrassing incidents was when I went to Wormwood Scrubs to take a prisoner out to an ID parade. I was driving an unmarked police car, with a white colleague in the back who was handcuffed to a black prisoner. We drove into the back of the station and all of a sudden a rapid response car drove right across my path. A WPC got out and banged on the window shouting, \"Do you mind telling me who you are?\" </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Did you complain about any of these things? </p> <p> <b> PC: </b><br> No. I've dealt with these things myself, approaching people on a one-to-one basis. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Lets talk about the differences within races and also between communities. Faizal, is this is an issue? </p> <p> <b> FB: </b><br> We've got to accept that there are people who perhaps don't want to be labelled in ethnic or racial terms. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> What would you call yourself? </p> <p> <b> FB: </b><br> British Muslim. My roots are here, I was born here. My parents come from the subcontinent but my connections are very tenuous. I've never been there, but at the same time I have an identity that transcends race or anything else, something that comes from within, and that's Muslim. </p> <p> <b> GY: </b><br> We're all several things at the same time and different identities will come to the fore at different moments. The issue is whether there is ever a time when Asian is a relevant thing to call someone whose ancestors come from the subcontinent. </p> <p> <b> CO:</b><br> Absolutely. I think one of the reasons we're all so exercised about this particular issue is because it is visible. It is like gender - the kind of prejudice that we all know about because it is worn outside. The fact that you're Muslim may be the most important thing to you, but to somebody from the outside it is not the most evident. </p> <p> <b> IR:</b><br> The only useful terminology is the phrase British Asian. That's the only thing that actually connects this Asian community. Faizal and my parents would have nothing in common with each other culturally. But in the context of being British Asian they would. </p> <p> <b> LY: </b><br> The historical thing is important and interesting if we think about naming and categorising people. We describe black people as black and very often we don't describe white people as white, which shows the necessity to develop a more sophisticated language, understanding and analysis of what is going on. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> But because of the tension between a sense of race and a sense of place this is something that ethnic minorities have to think about and deal with on a daily basis. And now, for the first time, white people are engaged in it as well. </p> <p> <b> CO:</b><br> But I don't think John would even have announced the fact that he was a white middle-class man 10 years ago. People weren't doing that. There has been a raising of consciousness about how white people are perceived. </p> <p> <b> GY:</b><br> Is there a crisis in Englishness and whiteness?

He said, however, that while the main thrust of their search was complete, he would still reserve the right to carry out additional searches if necessary. This was the second day of weapons searches in Mitrovice following outbursts of aggression on Sunday in which US and German troops were attacked with stones and bottles by angry crowds objecting to the search of Serb owned buildings. The searches continued as Nato secretary general, George Robertson, denied that Kosovo Albanian charges of pro-Serb bias had forced other nationalities to join French troops in the town. French troops managed to cordon off the area yesterday to prevent any further incidents between Serb protesters and K-For, the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The arms search, which took place in both Serbian and Albanian sectors, resumed this morning and is said to have been the largest operation of its kind since NATO-led troops entered the province last June. Approximately 2,300 peacekeepers have been involved in the search and weapons had been retrieved. In total, seven Albanians and one Serb were arrested on Sunday for illegal weapons possession and two Albanians remained in custody today. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians on a 40 km (25 miles) unity march from Pristina to Mitrovice have been told they will not be allowed to enter the city for fear of fuelling ethnic tensions. Carrying banners which read \"No to Partition of Kosovo\" and \"Without Mitrovice there is no Kosovo\", only a small delegation will be allowed to enter the town which is divided along Serbian and Albanian ethnic lines. \"We had to reach a compromise as we didn't wish to inflame the situation,\" said Neville Clayton, a K-For spokesman.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We need a far more radical reform of the public sector, to make it more able to engage in the entrepreneurship and innovation which drives the private sector. What would that mean? We should create a venture capital or innovation fund - perhaps worth \u00a3150 million to begin with - within the public sector to invest systematically in the creation of new services and the dissemination of new ideas, especially those which combine different departments.</p> <p> Venture capital-style investment in the public sector should match that of the private sector, as a proportion of GDP. We need to create a much more active market for money to flow to people with talent and ideas in the public sector, regardless of their rank and standing. So, for example, it should be a requirement that people going into the senior civil service should have been involved in at least one public sector start-up, that is an attempt to create a new form of organization. The public sector needs to learn from large private sector organizations which have innovated by creating 'skunk works' to come up with new ideas, internal venture capital markets, ideas fairs and smaller sub-brands and spin-offs, with a more innovative culture.</p> <p> And finally we need to create new rewards to recognize the role of civic entrepreneurs, not necessarily in money, but through time off for study, for example. The entire welfare system should be broken up and operated by a group of competing mutuals and social enterprises. They would be mandated to meet minimum national standards of service, but they would compete in terms of their effectiveness in getting people back to work or providing quality of service. Only through creating more competition within the public sector will taxpayers be in a position to compare the relative cost and effectiveness of different ways of delivering welfare. That in turn will drive up performance. And within the next few years we should start to make more of the public sector's vast intangible assets. </p> <p>The privatisation programme of the 1980s focused on the industrial economy: steel, cars, oil, gas, electricity, water. In the next ten years we could raise hundreds of millions of pounds to be ploughed back into education by seeking to extract more value from the public sector's vast stock of largely dormant intangible assets.</p> <p>This New Economy privatisation programme would in turn depend on the creation of public-private partnerships to exploit these assets. As a simple example take the BBC's Top Gear website. Top Gear is an outstanding brand name. Its website gets thousands of hits from fans both of cars and of the programme's former presenter, Jeremy Clarkson. At the moment the TopGear site just sells merchandise related to the programme. However, it could become Europe's leading motoring website, allowing people to trade cars, buy accessories, search for insurance deals, upgrade their in-car navigation software and the like. That would take TopGear beyond the realm of the BBC and into the much larger marketplace for e-commerce. </p> <p>But to do that the BBC would have to sell say 49 per cent of the TopGear Web-business to a private partner with e-commerce expertise. As a purely BBC website TopGear will be marginal to the emerging e-commerce marketplace for cars. In a public-private partnership it could be a huge commercial success. This recipe could be followed with a string of BBC websites covering food, travel, home decoration and the like. The BBC has done a brilliant job in creating some of the best websites in Europe. Even at today's depressed stock-market valuations for Internet companies, the BBC's online assets are probably worth about \u00a38bn. If the BBC realized half of that by selling minority stakes in its online businesses to private partners, it could fund a massive expansion of its education activities.</p> <p>The political process and the character of the state could, in theory, change dramatically. Over the next few years an electronic and online political world will develop alongside the physical one we inherited from the Victorians. How long will it be before we have our first online election? The technology to make online voting possible is readily available.

      "bodyText": "We need a far more radical reform of the public sector, to make it more able to engage in the entrepreneurship and innovation which drives the private sector. What would that mean? We should create a venture capital or innovation fund - perhaps worth \u00a3150 million to begin with - within the public sector to invest systematically in the creation of new services and the dissemination of new ideas, especially those which combine different departments. Venture capital-style investment in the public sector should match that of the private sector, as a proportion of GDP. We need to create a much more active market for money to flow to people with talent and ideas in the public sector, regardless of their rank and standing. So, for example, it should be a requirement that people going into the senior civil service should have been involved in at least one public sector start-up, that is an attempt to create a new form of organization. The public sector needs to learn from large private sector organizations which have innovated by creating 'skunk works' to come up with new ideas, internal venture capital markets, ideas fairs and smaller sub-brands and spin-offs, with a more innovative culture. And finally we need to create new rewards to recognize the role of civic entrepreneurs, not necessarily in money, but through time off for study, for example. The entire welfare system should be broken up and operated by a group of competing mutuals and social enterprises. They would be mandated to meet minimum national standards of service, but they would compete in terms of their effectiveness in getting people back to work or providing quality of service. Only through creating more competition within the public sector will taxpayers be in a position to compare the relative cost and effectiveness of different ways of delivering welfare. That in turn will drive up performance. And within the next few years we should start to make more of the public sector's vast intangible assets. The privatisation programme of the 1980s focused on the industrial economy: steel, cars, oil, gas, electricity, water. In the next ten years we could raise hundreds of millions of pounds to be ploughed back into education by seeking to extract more value from the public sector's vast stock of largely dormant intangible assets. This New Economy privatisation programme would in turn depend on the creation of public-private partnerships to exploit these assets. As a simple example take the BBC's Top Gear website. Top Gear is an outstanding brand name. Its website gets thousands of hits from fans both of cars and of the programme's former presenter, Jeremy Clarkson. At the moment the TopGear site just sells merchandise related to the programme. However, it could become Europe's leading motoring website, allowing people to trade cars, buy accessories, search for insurance deals, upgrade their in-car navigation software and the like. That would take TopGear beyond the realm of the BBC and into the much larger marketplace for e-commerce. But to do that the BBC would have to sell say 49 per cent of the TopGear Web-business to a private partner with e-commerce expertise. As a purely BBC website TopGear will be marginal to the emerging e-commerce marketplace for cars. In a public-private partnership it could be a huge commercial success. This recipe could be followed with a string of BBC websites covering food, travel, home decoration and the like. The BBC has done a brilliant job in creating some of the best websites in Europe. Even at today's depressed stock-market valuations for Internet companies, the BBC's online assets are probably worth about \u00a38bn. If the BBC realized half of that by selling minority stakes in its online businesses to private partners, it could fund a massive expansion of its education activities. The political process and the character of the state could, in theory, change dramatically. Over the next few years an electronic and online political world will develop alongside the physical one we inherited from the Victorians. How long will it be before we have our first online election? The technology to make online voting possible is readily available. We should set ourselves the target to make the election after next - 2007 - the first one in which people can vote electronically. And if we can vote electronically once, then we could do so over and over again, not once every five years but on legislation as it passes through the House of Commons. The House of Commons, rather like other intermediary bodies, is designed to represent large groups of people. But when technology allows people to plug into the political process directly, then Members of Parliament, like other intermediaries, such as insurance brokers and travel agents, may find themselves looking for a new role in life. When people can buy, sell, trade and invest directly using the internet and its successors, as they will in the next five years, they will want to know why they cannot interact with the political system in the same direct way. The Commons itself would continue to exist, perhaps mainly as a tourist attraction and symbolic font of parliamentary democracy, but much of the business of government, the largest paper-processing business in the country, could be conducted electronically. Just to give you one example of what that might mean, think about what happens when you get your next prescription from your doctor. First your doctor types into her computer and prints out a piece of paper. Then you take the paper to the chemist, who writes into her computer and prints out a label for your- bottle of pills and another piece of paper which goes off to a central paper-processing unit in Newcastle.

The comeback of GW Bush in South Carolina's Saturday primary against the in-your-face insurgent John McCain was a relief to the party bosses, who have staked all on GW - but they should have seen the smiles on the faces of Al Gore's men in the Democratic encampments.</p> <p>The Democrats reckon that McCain, a maverick with a chest full of medals, a wise-cracking mouth and an appeal to the independent voters proven once again, would have been harder to beat in the general election. The latest poll suggests they are right. In presidential trial heats just conducted by CNN/USA Today/Gallup, Al Gore is at 45% and Bush at 50% but McCain romps away with 55% against Gore's 39%. The most recent ABC/Washington Post poll, taken between February 3 and 6 shows that with Pat Buchanan taking 5% for the Reform party - and he looks set to be the nominee - Bush and Gore are at a statistical dead heat.</p> <p>Of course, the Republican scrap is not over yet. McCain will almost surely win his native state of Arizona next Tuesday and he has the edge the same day in Michigan where Bush will not be able to play Onward Christian Soldiers at the volume he did in South Carolina, where the rightwing Christian Coalition is well organised. But even if McCain wins in Michigan he faces another blitz of negative advertising and the superior resources of the Bush campaign in getting out the Republican vote on a succession of Super Tuesdays in March when many states votes.</p> <p>While the Republican leaders have been sticking needles in models of John McCain, something else has been going on. Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, has been gaining in popularity. It is a safe bet that he has squashed the challenge from Bill Bradley, a clever and likable man who has somehow come over as a patronising whiner: folks, how privileged you are to be able to vote for me.</p> <p>And now a Gore presidency is not the chimera it was thought a few months ago. The polls vary, but all agree that Gore has gained from three to five points in the last month. What is going on? Gore is coming over as a man who knows his stuff - and is less stuffy. The Bradley challenge has roused him to fight. The common wisdom has been that his experience and decency won't count because reference to eight years in the White House will remind everyone that he stood loyally by a liar. The Republicans have been playing this \"Clinton fatigue\" hard. Bush and McCain have been competing over who is the most unlike Clinton. Most commenta tors have bought into this leprosy theory.</p> <p>I wonder.</p> <p>Just as during the impeachment crisis, the public does not parrot what it is told it is supposed to be thinking. A little publicised poll by Gallup/CNN/USA Today, taken between February 2 and 15, finds Clinton's job approval rate at 62%; Fox News/Opinion Dynamics has it at a phenomenal 66%. Bill Clinton has been a very successful president: but for the 22nd amendment he might well have run and won a third term.</p> <p>The good times are the principal reason for this, but there has also been a deepening realisation that there was indeed a rightwing plot to bring him down. A majority wants to forgive and forget Clinton's lapses and that was before the publication of a best selling book by the non-partisan journalist and lawyer Jeffrey Toobin. In A Vast Conspiracy, Toobin has coolly unravelled how extremists of the political right tried to use the legal system to undo Clinton's election. Clinton certainly had a less than fair press which constantly had its ear cocked, and its critical faculties suspended, for any leak from Ken Starr's prosecutorial team. There were big headlines for the purported scandals of Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, and others, but when they all evaporated the acquittals got nothing like the same play, even in the better papers like the New York Times and Washington Post, a shaming fact which gives a little glow of martyrdom to the departing president.</p> <p>\"The astonishing fact,\" writes Toobin, \"may be this one: in spite of his consistently reprehensible behaviour, Clinton was, by comparison, the good guy in this struggle.\" He looked it when he stood up to give his state of the union address, full of good news and high promise, and the Republicans sat on their hands like so many thwarted bullies.</p> <p>Clinton has kept away from the campaign while Gore has established his independence. But come the fall expect an ebullient president to emerge. He is eager to do that, refreshed and confident again. And he is by far and away the best campaigner of them all, as good as Harold Macmillan whose \"Supermac\" battle cry he could echo. \"You've never had it so good. Why risk it with the untried Daddy's boy from Texas?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ranks of the loyalist Republicans should scarce forbear to cheer. The comeback of GW Bush in South Carolina's Saturday primary against the in-your-face insurgent John McCain was a relief to the party bosses, who have staked all on GW - but they should have seen the smiles on the faces of Al Gore's men in the Democratic encampments. The Democrats reckon that McCain, a maverick with a chest full of medals, a wise-cracking mouth and an appeal to the independent voters proven once again, would have been harder to beat in the general election. The latest poll suggests they are right. In presidential trial heats just conducted by CNN/USA Today/Gallup, Al Gore is at 45% and Bush at 50% but McCain romps away with 55% against Gore's 39%. The most recent ABC/Washington Post poll, taken between February 3 and 6 shows that with Pat Buchanan taking 5% for the Reform party - and he looks set to be the nominee - Bush and Gore are at a statistical dead heat. Of course, the Republican scrap is not over yet. McCain will almost surely win his native state of Arizona next Tuesday and he has the edge the same day in Michigan where Bush will not be able to play Onward Christian Soldiers at the volume he did in South Carolina, where the rightwing Christian Coalition is well organised. But even if McCain wins in Michigan he faces another blitz of negative advertising and the superior resources of the Bush campaign in getting out the Republican vote on a succession of Super Tuesdays in March when many states votes. While the Republican leaders have been sticking needles in models of John McCain, something else has been going on. Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, has been gaining in popularity. It is a safe bet that he has squashed the challenge from Bill Bradley, a clever and likable man who has somehow come over as a patronising whiner: folks, how privileged you are to be able to vote for me. And now a Gore presidency is not the chimera it was thought a few months ago. The polls vary, but all agree that Gore has gained from three to five points in the last month. What is going on? Gore is coming over as a man who knows his stuff - and is less stuffy. The Bradley challenge has roused him to fight. The common wisdom has been that his experience and decency won't count because reference to eight years in the White House will remind everyone that he stood loyally by a liar. The Republicans have been playing this \"Clinton fatigue\" hard. Bush and McCain have been competing over who is the most unlike Clinton. Most commenta tors have bought into this leprosy theory. I wonder. Just as during the impeachment crisis, the public does not parrot what it is told it is supposed to be thinking. A little publicised poll by Gallup/CNN/USA Today, taken between February 2 and 15, finds Clinton's job approval rate at 62%; Fox News/Opinion Dynamics has it at a phenomenal 66%. Bill Clinton has been a very successful president: but for the 22nd amendment he might well have run and won a third term. The good times are the principal reason for this, but there has also been a deepening realisation that there was indeed a rightwing plot to bring him down. A majority wants to forgive and forget Clinton's lapses and that was before the publication of a best selling book by the non-partisan journalist and lawyer Jeffrey Toobin. In A Vast Conspiracy, Toobin has coolly unravelled how extremists of the political right tried to use the legal system to undo Clinton's election. Clinton certainly had a less than fair press which constantly had its ear cocked, and its critical faculties suspended, for any leak from Ken Starr's prosecutorial team. There were big headlines for the purported scandals of Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, and others, but when they all evaporated the acquittals got nothing like the same play, even in the better papers like the New York Times and Washington Post, a shaming fact which gives a little glow of martyrdom to the departing president. \"The astonishing fact,\" writes Toobin, \"may be this one: in spite of his consistently reprehensible behaviour, Clinton was, by comparison, the good guy in this struggle.\" He looked it when he stood up to give his state of the union address, full of good news and high promise, and the Republicans sat on their hands like so many thwarted bullies. Clinton has kept away from the campaign while Gore has established his independence. But come the fall expect an ebullient president to emerge. He is eager to do that, refreshed and confident again. And he is by far and away the best campaigner of them all, as good as Harold Macmillan whose \"Supermac\" battle cry he could echo. \"You've never had it so good. Why risk it with the untried Daddy's boy from Texas?\"",

And I think it's something that will improve. When I was a kid I was the only Asian in school and some teachers were racist. Now my kids' schools are very mixed and that isn't tolerated. The whole country has become more liberal. </p> <p>I feel much more optimistic than before. That's partly because racist attitudes, which will always continue, are considered to be anathema. You can't get away with it. Even if you continue to think it in private, you can't get away with it in public. It's not tolerated in institutions and that's the most important thing.</p> <p> <strong>Ahdaf Soueif</strong><br> I should think that in terms of awareness, race is a more high profile issue. How that filters through to how people feel about race is a different question. </p> <p>There have been big reports before, like the Scott inquiry, and before that the Warnock inquiry. Every time it's as if this is some amazing revelation which creates a change in the national psyche, and things can never be the same again. </p> <p>I don't know how true that is. But a hunch would be that where you have a situation like we are seeing in Britain now - where there is a sizeable underclass even compared to 10 years ago, where you have a whole mass of people who are poor, who have never held down a job, who are desocialised and disenfranchised - it's extremely unlikely that you're going to find a general shift in attitudes towards tolerance. </p> <p>While maybe there is a change in public awareness and a position that the elite and the educated and the upper middle classes take, whether things like that filter all the way throughout society I would very much doubt. </p> <p>The media try, on the whole, to do the fair thing, and this is going to become more of an issue as you see more Asian faces in the media. You see so many names now from the sub-continent, that this on its own is going to change things. </p> <p>But the Afro-Caribbean and black African community is far less represented. There's a perception that Asian people work hard and do well, but black people don't. </p> <p>For instance, a great deal was made of the fact that Stephen Lawrence was an A-level student, as if he was not just like all those other black kids you see hanging around the streets. </p> <p>The Macpherson report brought the problem centre stage. People have paid attention to it. But what happens next?</p> <p>\u0095 Interviews by Esther Addley</p>",

Even if you continue to think it in private, you can't get away with it in public. It's not tolerated in institutions and that's the most important thing. Ahdaf Soueif I should think that in terms of awareness, race is a more high profile issue. How that filters through to how people feel about race is a different question. There have been big reports before, like the Scott inquiry, and before that the Warnock inquiry. Every time it's as if this is some amazing revelation which creates a change in the national psyche, and things can never be the same again. I don't know how true that is. But a hunch would be that where you have a situation like we are seeing in Britain now - where there is a sizeable underclass even compared to 10 years ago, where you have a whole mass of people who are poor, who have never held down a job, who are desocialised and disenfranchised - it's extremely unlikely that you're going to find a general shift in attitudes towards tolerance. While maybe there is a change in public awareness and a position that the elite and the educated and the upper middle classes take, whether things like that filter all the way throughout society I would very much doubt. The media try, on the whole, to do the fair thing, and this is going to become more of an issue as you see more Asian faces in the media. You see so many names now from the sub-continent, that this on its own is going to change things. But the Afro-Caribbean and black African community is far less represented. There's a perception that Asian people work hard and do well, but black people don't. For instance, a great deal was made of the fact that Stephen Lawrence was an A-level student, as if he was not just like all those other black kids you see hanging around the streets. The Macpherson report brought the problem centre stage. People have paid attention to it. But what happens next? \u0095 Interviews by Esther Addley",

In an ideal world, you might even have met your date through the online singles service.</p> <p> The potential for brand extensions in the digital entertainment age is boundless. In June, Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4, announced his intention of turning it into a fully realised multi-media company and to double online spending. The interactive department was launched in January, with \u00a310m and six new businesses, under the control of Andy Anson, who had previously worked at Disney. The prize project is E4, a multi-tiered interactive entertainment platform.</p> <p> The offices of strategic planning on the third floor of Channel 4's headquarters at Horseferry Road in London have been the site of much blue-sky brainstorming in recent months. First, the future was broadband (interactive cable and satellite), then ADSL (high speed video access via telephone lines), then WAP (wireless application protocol); now it's a combination of all three and the medium is no longer relevant. The sky is the limit: except that was so last year. \"Sky got Open up and running first and opened up people's minds to the potential of interactive TV,\" says Anson, who hopes to overtake BSkyB's interactive service when E4 launches in November. Anson will also be up against BBC Online and ONdigital, which will launch an interactive TV-internet package in June. Channel 5 also wants to join the race. </p> <p> E4 will cover all the traditional ground - music, film, education, comedy, clubbing, shopping and fashion - while remaining true, Anson insists, to Channel 4's core values. \"The slogan for E4 is 'Friday night every night',\" he says (although this phrase has already been taken by the rival Paramount Comedy Channel). In other words, your favourite American sitcom and the usual after-hours music and clubbing fare will be available \"on demand\". E4 will be the window to watch Friends (which it has just outbid Sky to win), Dawson's Creek, Ally McBeal and ER. Before the envelope-lickers out there start firing off letters about the Mickey Mouse-ification of their trusty public service channel, it should be pointed out that Anson, who was head of consumer products at Disney, is British and understands Channel 4's rather quirky audience. \"The idea is to use the web as a breeding ground for new talent, ideas and innovation - we're looking for the next Ali G,\" Anson says. \"Four used to be renowned for that, but since it's got a little more established, it's lost some of that edge.\" On the way back to that edge, Anson says he will take risks and \"not be scared to screw up\". </p> <p> Increased commercialisation, as e-commerce becomes a major revenue stream, will mean a bespoke service for the viewer. \"People are consuming media in a more niched fashion, getting music through a music channel, for example.\" </p> <p> E4 will build up a profile of each customer so that it can target programmes and even adverts. \"When you start mixing entertainment and service, then you have a pretty potent mix . . . you get closer to individuals than a broadcaster can ever get.\" </p> <p> Personal TV, which is what this adds up to, is already a familiar concept in the US, where companies such as TiVo and Replay offer video downloads on a pay-per-storage-time model. When E4 develops into broadband on the internet, viewers could be issued with a smart card that works on a pay-per-view basis, at a rate of, say, 50p for each programme. </p> <p> Channel 4's tireless pursuit of the consumer (\"We have to be where-ever the consumer is consuming the things we offer,\" Anson says), and its desire to be the very spout of innovation, have prompted this move into an untried market. WebTV has only just been unveiled by Microsoft, so Britain is ahead of the US in large-scale interactive thinking. In the US, the combined audience share of the networks has plummeted, due to the fragmentation of the market and people forsaking the box for the net. \"It's not happening as quickly over here because people still have that four channel mentality, but it's when the next generation of kids, the Sony addicts, grow up that the pressure will hit traditional broadcasters,\" says Anson. With Channel 4's audience share down 1% in the past five years, Anson shares Jackson's \"adapt to survive\" attitude. \"I think the erosion of our share is inevitable. We just have to make sure that if anyone is eating into our market share, it's us.\" </p> <p> In the interactive arena, the competition includes BBC Online (which has a clear lead on news) and Channel 5 (which, with a 5% terrestrial market share and \"the three Fs\" - football, films and fucking - is eyeing a substantial chunk of Channel 4's share), as well as smaller companies such as Paramount and Atom films, a US company which can already stream short movies to your PC. </p> <p> To take these on will require outside resources. \"We can't do it on our own - partnering is absolutely key. This is going to be a new experience for Four, which has always been one company, one channel in the public sector.\" Anson has been talking to everyone, from Warner Bros to Sony, to Emap, to Bob Geldof's mobile company and ISPs such as Yahoo and AOL. The challenge to keep the brand intact during all these changes will be greater than ever. Channel 4 has built customer loyalty by providing high-quality, ready-packaged broadcasting. Video-on-demand would be equivalent to an upmarket confectioner going pick 'n' mix. But Anson is adamant they have to \"embrace the future rather than run away. My guess is you'll still havelinear TV channels, but you'll have to offer video-on-demand as well - with Channel 4 packages on the menu.\" </p> <p> It is Anson's responsibility to ensure that all the programmes and talent are \"in the C4 world\". This might lead to alliances with smaller production companies and individual talent; and a desire to stick to the niches it knows best. Comedy will be represented by the faces of Dominic Jolly, Ali G and Smack the Pony, drama by the cast of Queer as Folk, sport by cricket and racing. </p> <p> A betting channel and a lesbian and gay network out4life.com will appear before E4. The February launch of out4life, for the Queer as Folk mindset, has been postponed a couple of months \"to get it right\". And Anson is pleased that Channel 4 has just beaten Sky to the horse racing rights. \"It's a no brainer,\" he says, but very lucrative. </p> <p> Film 4 interactive and an education channel (a tricky area because the Discovery Channel has such a strong foothold) will be next, introducing radical new schemes such as a tutorial for 16- to 24-year-olds who want to learn how to be a movie director or record producer. </p> <p> With replay TV at the touch of a button, will that Friday-night institution Friends ever be the same again? \"I think the social side of TV, what the Americans call the watercooler effect, is going to make linear [broadcasting through channels] stick around,\" says Anson. \"The value of Friends will actually go up as the value of good content becomes more and more important.\" Soaps and pop drama series could become even more vicariously addictive as audiences start to get interactive with plot lines. One proposed serialisation of the movie Human Traffic might run with a competition where viewers can submit MP3 mixes for next week's jingle. She's Gotta Have It, the fashion show in which contestants are given a budget to buy whatever they like, could turn into a very expensive night in with credit card interfaces. </p> <p> But while life will be easier for the viewers, with a million more reasons to stay on the sofa, advertisers will have to totally rethink their modes of communication.

Job cuts are expected to be highest in Perth, CGU's current base, and Norwich, where NU is a major employer. CGNU's head office will be in London. Its life insurance division will be based in York and UK general insurance operations, such as household and motor cover, will be centred on Norwich. Operations will be retained in other parts of the UK, including Perth and Sheffield. A further 1,000 jobs will go worldwide. The move comes as further grim news for workers in the insurance industry, which has seen tens of thousands of redundancies in the past five years, since the merger of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance in 1996. CGU chief executive Bob Scott, who will continue in the same role at the combined group, said: \"The merger of CGU and Norwich Union will create the UK's largest insurance group with strong positions in a number of European and international markets.\" NU chief executive Richard Harvey, who will become deputy chief executive in the combined group, said the deal would create significant value for both sets of shareholders.",

      "body": "<p>Even Sir Alex Ferguson did not have the chutzpah to suggest that his decision to drop David Beckham yesterday was intended purely as a masterful tactical stroke, wrongfooting not just the Leeds team but the Elland Road fans who had been looking forward to chanting obscenely at their favourite victim. </p> <p>It was, though, a remarkable gamble by Ferguson because he would have calculated the effect of Beckham's exclusion and what it intimated about the state of team affairs at Manchester United. And had his team lost, Ferguson would have been left with several dozen boxes of free-range trickling down his face. </p> <p>That he was prepared to take the gamble is proof that the relationship between manager and player is at breaking point. And this one cannot so easily be filed away among the other all-too-familiar cases of manager-star player-power battles which have always been part of football's colourful backdrop. </p> <p>Bobby Robson survived physical punch-ups with a couple of senior players at Ipswich before establishing control; Dave Sexton is said to have offered Peter Osgood a one-on-one confrontation in a locked room; and only a few months ago Ruud Gullit left Newcastle after losing the beauty contest with Alan Shearer.

      "bodyText": "Even Sir Alex Ferguson did not have the chutzpah to suggest that his decision to drop David Beckham yesterday was intended purely as a masterful tactical stroke, wrongfooting not just the Leeds team but the Elland Road fans who had been looking forward to chanting obscenely at their favourite victim. It was, though, a remarkable gamble by Ferguson because he would have calculated the effect of Beckham's exclusion and what it intimated about the state of team affairs at Manchester United. And had his team lost, Ferguson would have been left with several dozen boxes of free-range trickling down his face. That he was prepared to take the gamble is proof that the relationship between manager and player is at breaking point. And this one cannot so easily be filed away among the other all-too-familiar cases of manager-star player-power battles which have always been part of football's colourful backdrop. Bobby Robson survived physical punch-ups with a couple of senior players at Ipswich before establishing control; Dave Sexton is said to have offered Peter Osgood a one-on-one confrontation in a locked room; and only a few months ago Ruud Gullit left Newcastle after losing the beauty contest with Alan Shearer. Brian Clough, the ultimate manager as egotist, did not feel he was doing his job if he was not metaphorically, and sometimes physically, experiencing hand-on-throat relations with the likes of Kenny Burns and Larry Lloyd. Nor, given George Best's frequent disputes with Sir Matt Busby, is it new for the twin demands of football and celebrity to cause problems at Old Trafford.

      "body": "<p>An office the size of a golf course, a hat-trick of minders in tow and the ready ear of anyone he fancies entertaining. It must be wonderful being home secretary. Jack Straw has agreed to talk to the Guardian about race. It's not so surprising - this is his subject.</p> <p>Race is home turf, where he feels confident. After all, it was Straw who demanded an inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence following years of Tory indifference, Straw who masterminded the new race relations act and Straw who finally agreed to make indirect racism an offence. All notable achievements.</p> <p>There is barely time to register the camp pastel walls and family photographs before Straw is shaking my hand, apologising for being short of time. How important is race to his job? \"It is the most important part of my job. If there's one thing I feel I've made the greatest difference in, it's setting up the Lawrence inquiry. It's one of the key things on which I want to be judged because you can't have a safe, just and tolerant society unless you've got a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society.\" He doesn't even gasp for breath.</p> <p>Straw calls racism \"a kind of madness\" and says it is his job to change attitudes as well as policies. He is MP for Blackburn, a town with a large Asian population and an infamous racist heritage. He says it has been crucial in shaping his attitude to race, and sweeps back to pre-parliamentary life in 1976 when the British National Party fielded two candidates in Blackburn. \"We had to work very hard to improve race relations.\"</p> <p>Today, Blackburn is hardly renowned for its racial harmony. What happens when he goes home and Johnny Racist tell him that \"pakis\" have destroyed their once great town? \"On the whole, people don't.\" But when they do? \"I ask them to describe their family and where they come from, and almost inevitably they come from somewhere else at some stage. I'll say, 'How d'you think Asian people turned up in this town?' Then I explain that there was a labour shortage in the 50s and Conservative mill owners were advertising in the Gujarat and the Punjab. Normally they go away thinking differently.\"</p> <p>He smiles at the happy result. But this is where Straw's race politics become confusing. While he talks with pride of the riches provided by previous generations of economic immigrants, he shows contempt for those seeking economic or political asylum today. He believes many asylum seekers are operating a \"racket,\" he has labelled travellers \"thieves\". Last week the Wall Street Journal said that his unsympathetic response to the Afghan hostages mirrored the attitude of the Taliban.</p> <p>It's as if \"Black Britain\" and \"asylum seekers\" are mutually exclusive issues. Yes, we can be an all-embracing, multi-cultural society and yes, we can also turn our back on any number of people fleeing from persecution or poverty. Perhaps he feels, as many do, that the way of achieving racial harmony here is by keeping a balance.</p> <p>He recoils in his chair. \"Well, not racially balanced. I wouldn't use that phrase. I want a society that provides equality between people of different races but also celebrates their diversity, and I think it's terrific that we are such a mixed society these days. But there is a limited capacity of any country to take in unlimited numbers.</p> <p>\"Interestingly, I find some of the strongest support for our approach - a fair application to the 1951 convention on asylum which we apply very firmly to those who have unfounded claims - among my Asian constituents or other people's Afro-Caribbean constituents.\"</p> <p>He has a point. The last batch of immigrants are often the first to pull up the ladder. But surely the fact that black and Asian and Jewish people can be selfish and bigoted themselves is a shabby justification for an unforgiving asylum policy.</p> <p>When Straw was in Opposition, he criticised the Tory asylum package that included the voucher system. Now, of course, he is very much in favour of the vouchers which force asylum-seekers to shop at expensive supermarkets. Is it a deterrent? \"Sometimes there are genuine asylum-seekers whose applications are not well founded. I had a chap from Kenya in my constituency who had a genuine fear of persecution, but it wasn't a well-founded fear. In the end he went back and he's been OK. But his fear was genuine because of what happened to him.\" It's a disturbing, open-ended story.</p> <p>I tell Straw of the survey in today's Guardian which shows that 53% of white people would not mind if a close relative married a black or Asian person. It's a massive step forward from five years ago. \"Good. Great !\" he says. And he does look delighted.</p> <p>So where were did these complex views of race develop? He talks about the all-white world he grew up in. \"I think there was one black lad in secondary school. I remember my father bringing home an Iraqi and being slightly surprised at his different features. In primary school a quarter of the globe was pink, run by British men.</p> <p>\"I remember being shown a film strip of natives, and we were told that they were 'the niggers' I thought it was odd at the time.\"</p> <p>He moves on to 1964 and the first election with which he was involved. \"We had the Smethwick defeat of Patrick Gordon Walker with the slogan 'If you want a nigger for your neighbour vote Liberal or Labour.' We had Enoch Powell in the late 60s . . .\"</p> <p>What would his mother have said if he had told her he was marrying a black woman? \"She would have been fine. No question.\" Unusual attitude for the time? \"Yes, she was a very unusual woman.\" And his father? \"Ditto.\" And his grandparents? \"Not sure about grandparents . . . not sure.\"</p> <p>Does he think we have become more racially relaxed? \"Oh, yes. But there's still a long way to go, particuarly in employment practices. Take this place, the home office. Decent, liberally minded people running it for years and yet, when we surveyed the staff about 18 months ago, black and Asian people were very angry at how they had been treated. Although, in theory, the procedures were fair because there was no direct discrimination. In practice, black and Asian people who were talented were being held back.\"</p> <p>Incredible progress. Only, we still have the the racist killing of Michael Menson; at least 30 other inadequately investigated black deaths in 90s Britain; the disproportionate numbers of black deaths in custody; the fact that young black men are twice as likely to be unemployed as white, four times as likely to end up in jail; the fact that we can stop Neville Lawrence as a suspected robber, the fact that we can stop and search Duwayne Brooks, the friend of Stephen Lawrence who was with him when he died, any number of times; the fact that 47% of white people would still be distraught if close family married someone black.</p> <p>Progress is one thing. A fair society another. Can black people have confidence in the police now? \"They can have greater confidence in the police. I mean, the police service has been through a cultural shock as a result of Macpherson.\"</p> <p>At times Straw sounds a similar note to the police chiefs who complain their officers have been traumatised. In what ways should we not feel confident? \"I'm obviously concerned about the disproportionate number of stop and searches of black people who appear to be wholly innocent.\"</p> <p>If we acknowledge that there is institutionalised racism in the police, why haven't the institutionalised racists been kicked out?</p> <p>\"Let me finish,\" Straw says, before he has even begun to answer. \"I've changed the disciplinary process for the police service so now the burden of proof is a civil burden of proof, not the criminal burden of proof, and where explicit racism is proved against police officers they are then the subject of a disciplinary process. And we've changed the criminal law as well. And there have been over 100 prosecutions since that part of the crime and disorder bill came into force.\"</p> <p>Perhaps unintentionally, he has given a classic politician's answer. Merging two distinct issues into one fug. The 100 prosecutions have been against members of the public for racially motivated crimes, not against police officers. When I later ask the home office how many officers have been disciplined for racism since Macpherson, it cannot provide an answer. The police complaints authority has no figures either. One can't help but suspect the figure would be similar to the number of officers disciplined in the Lawrence case - none.</p> <p>Straw returns to a favourite caveat. \"Unwitting racism is much more difficult to prove because it is by definition people who themselves feel they are behaving perfectly decently . . . it is not about kicking people out, it is about changing people's attitudes.\" Many people believe the best way of changing attitudes is by showing racists zero tolerance.</p> <p>If race is the most important part of his job how important is it to keep in touch with black culture? \"Black and Asian culture,\" he corrects me. \"I do my best.\" What is the last black film he saw? \" Bl-aaack . . . fiillm ? What was the last film I saw would be a bigger question. I mean, given the nature of my job . . . I read the Voice. . .\"</p> <p>I apologise for the vague nature of the question. What is the last Spike Lee movie he saw? \"The last who ? Who's he talking about?\" he pleads of the minders. \"I didn't . . . I've not seen a Spike Lee film, but I don't think I'm therefore disqualified from all this. Because if you go through a long list of pop stars . . . I was given an award the other day for spotting . . . It's not that I'm an old fogey, but I mean, you know, I'm busy. I have as much contact with black and Asian people and white people on the street, citizens, as I can. I happen to do a strange job in which I have to struggle hard to meet people in relaxed circumstances.\"</p> <p>Who'd be a home secretary?</p>",

Only, we still have the the racist killing of Michael Menson; at least 30 other inadequately investigated black deaths in 90s Britain; the disproportionate numbers of black deaths in custody; the fact that young black men are twice as likely to be unemployed as white, four times as likely to end up in jail; the fact that we can stop Neville Lawrence as a suspected robber, the fact that we can stop and search Duwayne Brooks, the friend of Stephen Lawrence who was with him when he died, any number of times; the fact that 47% of white people would still be distraught if close family married someone black. Progress is one thing. A fair society another. Can black people have confidence in the police now? \"They can have greater confidence in the police. I mean, the police service has been through a cultural shock as a result of Macpherson.\" At times Straw sounds a similar note to the police chiefs who complain their officers have been traumatised. In what ways should we not feel confident? \"I'm obviously concerned about the disproportionate number of stop and searches of black people who appear to be wholly innocent.\" If we acknowledge that there is institutionalised racism in the police, why haven't the institutionalised racists been kicked out? \"Let me finish,\" Straw says, before he has even begun to answer. \"I've changed the disciplinary process for the police service so now the burden of proof is a civil burden of proof, not the criminal burden of proof, and where explicit racism is proved against police officers they are then the subject of a disciplinary process. And we've changed the criminal law as well. And there have been over 100 prosecutions since that part of the crime and disorder bill came into force.\" Perhaps unintentionally, he has given a classic politician's answer. Merging two distinct issues into one fug. The 100 prosecutions have been against members of the public for racially motivated crimes, not against police officers. When I later ask the home office how many officers have been disciplined for racism since Macpherson, it cannot provide an answer. The police complaints authority has no figures either. One can't help but suspect the figure would be similar to the number of officers disciplined in the Lawrence case - none. Straw returns to a favourite caveat. \"Unwitting racism is much more difficult to prove because it is by definition people who themselves feel they are behaving perfectly decently . . . it is not about kicking people out, it is about changing people's attitudes.\" Many people believe the best way of changing attitudes is by showing racists zero tolerance. If race is the most important part of his job how important is it to keep in touch with black culture? \"Black and Asian culture,\" he corrects me. \"I do my best.\" What is the last black film he saw? \" Bl-aaack . . . fiillm ? What was the last film I saw would be a bigger question. I mean, given the nature of my job . . . I read the Voice. . .\" I apologise for the vague nature of the question. What is the last Spike Lee movie he saw? \"The last who ? Who's he talking about?\" he pleads of the minders. \"I didn't . . . I've not seen a Spike Lee film, but I don't think I'm therefore disqualified from all this. Because if you go through a long list of pop stars . . . I was given an award the other day for spotting . . . It's not that I'm an old fogey, but I mean, you know, I'm busy. I have as much contact with black and Asian people and white people on the street, citizens, as I can. I happen to do a strange job in which I have to struggle hard to meet people in relaxed circumstances.\" Who'd be a home secretary?",

At the stroke of 1pm there are as many as 200 people here, all men. They stand in three long lines at the front of the room, alternately bowing, bending and kneeling, according to the lead set by the imam. To the uninitiated this probably looks like a scene off the news, from Tehran or Kabul. The men are barefoot, many in the traditional kurta - a knee-length tunic worn over trousers. Some wear the safa, the trademark headgear of the mujaheddin. But look closer. One of the younger men is obeying the Muslim command to cover his head by wearing a balaclava, complete with Nike swoosh. Another is wearing a jellaba - over a Tommy Hilfiger fleece.</p> <p>Watching over it all, shushing and shepherding the flock, is the mosque's treasurer Ahmed Kazi. Born in South Africa, he's lived in Birmingham for 32 years. At 53 he qualifies as an elder of the community. I ask him about the young men in jeans and shellsuits. They were born here in Britain - they speak English with a Brummie accent - and yet they are also expected to come no fewer than five times a day, between shifts at the factory or the Post Office, to chant in Arabic. How do they live like that, in two worlds?</p> <p>\"We try to teach them that this is the host country and they have to live in it,\" he says, but he acknowledges the tension. Those who do well long to move out of the traditionally Asian areas; the younger generation tries to fit in with white culture. I ask him about East is East, the film about a Pakistani father in Salford trying to keep his errant sons within the communal fold. He hasn't seen it but grins in recognition of the plotline about a young man called Tariq who tries to become Tony. \"Oh yes, we have Mohammeds who become Mo or Suleimans who want to be Solly.\"</p> <p>I'm still chewing over that phrase Kazi had used, \"the host country\". What did he mean? \"In the old days we thought we would come here, send some money back and eventually go home.\" But the new generation don't see it that way. \"A lot of people don't consider it the host country, they consider it their home.\"</p> <p>And yet, he says, the old country is still home, too. \"Sometimes when people say 'home' you have to ask which home they're talking about,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>Later a Sikh woman will put her finger on it. \"I'm not an Indian, I'm not a British,\" she will say. \"I live in between.\" She is Hardip Kaur, who, along with her husband Inderjit Singh, runs a newsagent and convenience store on the Soho Road in Handsworth. Inderjit is a former lawyer who edits the Panjabi Guardian, a weekly digest of news from both the Handsworth community and the Punjab. Like Hardip, the newspaper lives \"in between\". Their office is above the shop, on the Soho Road - Birmingham's Little India. Cramped into a tiny office, with half an eye on a closed-circuit TV set monitoring the shop, I ask them what I'd asked Ahmed. Where's home?</p> <p>\"That's a difficult question, I wouldn't have a direct answer to that,\" says Hardip. Both were born in the Punjab, but she has lived in Britain since she was nine. \"I've got a British passport, but I wouldn't say I'm British. I'm Indian because at the end of the day, that's all that people notice about me.\"</p> <p>What about \"British-Asian?\" Would that label fit? Perhaps, she says. But no one ever calls her that. People tell her all the time that she's Asian; it's not often people point out she's British. Her two-year-old son, Gurbir, is on her knee, pressing the buttons on a mobile phone. Hardip has clear ambitions for him: \"Not to be shopkeepers! Not to work like we do, 12 hours every day. I want them to have a better education and a better life.\"</p> <p>I find myself liking Hardip and Inderjit very much; I feel comfortable with them and their kids. I can't quite work out what the source of this warm feeling is until an unexpected word suggests itself: nostalgia. It strikes me that if a reporter for the Manchester Guardian had gone to Luton 50 or so years ago to write about the Jews of Britain, and had bumped into David and Lily Freedland, he might well have had the same conversation I was having with the Singhs. My grandparents would have spoken in the same way about their deepest wishes for their children (education), their dreams of success (a profession) - and their fears if those wishes were granted. \"There are clashes over religion, customs, ways of living, ways of eating,\" says Inderjit, scaring himself with images of his children out in the big, wide, \"English\" world. \"You will lose your roots if the kids venture out.\"</p> <p>There is a shadow over every immigrant's story, and so it is for the Singhs. Ask them directly about racism and they - like every Asian I spoke to - will initially wave it aside, as if to say \"we can cope\". But press harder and everyone has a stomach-curdling experience to relate. For the Singhs it's been personal, like the time some white lads forced open Inderjit's car window and started beating him. It's been professional - the threats from customers to burn down the shop, or the taunts at \"you Indian bastards\". And it's been institutional - the council's failure to install CCTV along Soho Road, for example, despite collecting \u00a3500 from each trader more than a year ago.</p> <p>Stop teenagers in the street and they'll tell you the same story. Shabab Ali, 19, tells how a white lad fired an air gun at him while he worked as a night cashier at a petrol station. He's still glad his parents came to Britain: \"It's a better life here. More freedom, more modernised, more westernised.\" And will he find his place in it? \"It's a mixed country now,\" he says. The politicians are still English, \"but the rest is all mixed.\"</p>",

Watching over it all, shushing and shepherding the flock, is the mosque's treasurer Ahmed Kazi. Born in South Africa, he's lived in Birmingham for 32 years. At 53 he qualifies as an elder of the community. I ask him about the young men in jeans and shellsuits. They were born here in Britain - they speak English with a Brummie accent - and yet they are also expected to come no fewer than five times a day, between shifts at the factory or the Post Office, to chant in Arabic. How do they live like that, in two worlds? \"We try to teach them that this is the host country and they have to live in it,\" he says, but he acknowledges the tension. Those who do well long to move out of the traditionally Asian areas; the younger generation tries to fit in with white culture. I ask him about East is East, the film about a Pakistani father in Salford trying to keep his errant sons within the communal fold. He hasn't seen it but grins in recognition of the plotline about a young man called Tariq who tries to become Tony. \"Oh yes, we have Mohammeds who become Mo or Suleimans who want to be Solly.\" I'm still chewing over that phrase Kazi had used, \"the host country\". What did he mean? \"In the old days we thought we would come here, send some money back and eventually go home.\" But the new generation don't see it that way. \"A lot of people don't consider it the host country, they consider it their home.\" And yet, he says, the old country is still home, too. \"Sometimes when people say 'home' you have to ask which home they're talking about,\" he chuckles. Later a Sikh woman will put her finger on it. \"I'm not an Indian, I'm not a British,\" she will say. \"I live in between.\" She is Hardip Kaur, who, along with her husband Inderjit Singh, runs a newsagent and convenience store on the Soho Road in Handsworth. Inderjit is a former lawyer who edits the Panjabi Guardian, a weekly digest of news from both the Handsworth community and the Punjab. Like Hardip, the newspaper lives \"in between\". Their office is above the shop, on the Soho Road - Birmingham's Little India. Cramped into a tiny office, with half an eye on a closed-circuit TV set monitoring the shop, I ask them what I'd asked Ahmed. Where's home? \"That's a difficult question, I wouldn't have a direct answer to that,\" says Hardip. Both were born in the Punjab, but she has lived in Britain since she was nine. \"I've got a British passport, but I wouldn't say I'm British. I'm Indian because at the end of the day, that's all that people notice about me.\" What about \"British-Asian?\" Would that label fit? Perhaps, she says. But no one ever calls her that. People tell her all the time that she's Asian; it's not often people point out she's British. Her two-year-old son, Gurbir, is on her knee, pressing the buttons on a mobile phone. Hardip has clear ambitions for him: \"Not to be shopkeepers! Not to work like we do, 12 hours every day. I want them to have a better education and a better life.\" I find myself liking Hardip and Inderjit very much; I feel comfortable with them and their kids. I can't quite work out what the source of this warm feeling is until an unexpected word suggests itself: nostalgia. It strikes me that if a reporter for the Manchester Guardian had gone to Luton 50 or so years ago to write about the Jews of Britain, and had bumped into David and Lily Freedland, he might well have had the same conversation I was having with the Singhs. My grandparents would have spoken in the same way about their deepest wishes for their children (education), their dreams of success (a profession) - and their fears if those wishes were granted. \"There are clashes over religion, customs, ways of living, ways of eating,\" says Inderjit, scaring himself with images of his children out in the big, wide, \"English\" world. \"You will lose your roots if the kids venture out.\" There is a shadow over every immigrant's story, and so it is for the Singhs. Ask them directly about racism and they - like every Asian I spoke to - will initially wave it aside, as if to say \"we can cope\". But press harder and everyone has a stomach-curdling experience to relate. For the Singhs it's been personal, like the time some white lads forced open Inderjit's car window and started beating him. It's been professional - the threats from customers to burn down the shop, or the taunts at \"you Indian bastards\". And it's been institutional - the council's failure to install CCTV along Soho Road, for example, despite collecting \u00a3500 from each trader more than a year ago. Stop teenagers in the street and they'll tell you the same story. Shabab Ali, 19, tells how a white lad fired an air gun at him while he worked as a night cashier at a petrol station. He's still glad his parents came to Britain: \"It's a better life here. More freedom, more modernised, more westernised.\" And will he find his place in it? \"It's a mixed country now,\" he says. The politicians are still English, \"but the rest is all mixed.\"",

      "body": "<b>Claire Gorham, TV broadcaster</b> <br> The significant thing is Jack Straw calling a public inquiry in the first place. It's the first time anyone has taken the issue seriously. He has really disproved himself since, but I will always respect and admire him for doing that at least. It needed a change of government. The Tories don't give a shit about black people. That's not what they stand for. They are \"patriots\" first and foremost. It might be true to say that for a lot of them repatriation would be quite a good option. <p>It still really surprises me how few black people there are of any profile on TV, apart from Trevor Macdonald, who is a white man with boot polish on his face as far as I'm concerned. I have had things said to me by people in TV that really goes to the heart of it. Like, \"putting a black face on TV means they are going to lose viewers\", or \"people don't know where to place you Claire, because you are black and intelligent\", as if black and intelligent don't go together in most viewers' minds. </p> <p>In London what sets us apart from other cities is that the fastest growing number of kids under the age of five are mixed-race. We don't have the whole segregation approach to black and white. When I go abroad and I'm with a white person I'm very conscious of that, you don't see people mixing as much. In London you see a lot of black and white couples, and it really heartens me when I see it. I suppose we are a nation of individuals, there's a kind of unilateral cultural experience elsewhere in Europe that we don't share, we are an island and set apart. We're a nation of eccentrics. </p> <p>However, people do often try to lump black people together, and think that we think, feel and act the same. It never ceases to amaze me how little understanding white people have of the diversity of black experience.</p> <p> <b>Hanif Kureishi - writer</b><br> It's deplorable that Stephen Lawrence's murder happened - I was brought up in that part of south London and it's very monocultural, very masculinist and rough. On the other hand, the fact that Labour came to power probably had a great effect on the attitudes of the police, in that they had to pursue racism with more seriousness. The main reason the institutions have changed - they have begun to - is down to the Labour government, much as one hates to admit it. So it isn't that racism has diminished, it's that it isn't allowed. </p> <p>It's quite interesting that the Daily Mail took up the Stephen Lawrence case and that middle England is more tolerant; or at least the penny has dropped that we're not going to go away. </p> <p>The papers have reverted to type over the Afghan hijack refugees - it's Middle English hysteria. Though if you really ask people about that they are probably much more tolerant about it than the papers. It was interesting that far from complaining, the Tory MP for the area where the refugees were sent temporarily welcomed them. </p> <p>I certainly think Britain is more liberal than many European countries - in France, for instance, there's far more xenophobia. And I think it's something that will improve. When I was a kid I was the only Asian in school and some teachers were racist. Now my kids' schools are very mixed and that isn't tolerated. The whole country has become more liberal. </p> <p>I feel much more optimistic than before. That's partly because racist attitudes, which will always continue, are considered to be anathema. You can't get away with it. Even if you continue to think it in private, you can't get away with it in public. It's not tolerated in institutions and that's the most important thing.</p> <p> <b>Ahdaf Soueif, novelist</b><br> I should think that in terms of awareness, race is a more high profile issue. How that filters through to how people feel about race is a different question. </p> <p>There have been big reports before, like the Scott inquiry, and before that the Warnock inquiry. Every time it's as if this is some amazing revelation which creates a change in the national psyche, and things can never be the same again. </p> <p>I don't know how true that is. But a hunch would be that where you have a situation like we are seeing in Britain now - where there is a sizeable underclass even compared to 10 years ago, where you have a whole mass of people who are poor, who have never held down a job, who are desocialised and disenfranchised - it's extremely unlikely that you're going to find a general shift in attitudes towards tolerance. </p> <p>While maybe there is a change in public awareness and a position that the elite and the educated and the upper middle classes take, whether things like that filter all the way throughout society I would very much doubt. </p> <p>The media try, on the whole, to do the fair thing, and this is going to become more of an issue as you see more Asian faces in the media. You see so many names now from the sub-continent, that this on its own is going to change things. </p> <p>But the Afro-Caribbean and black African community is far less represented. There's a perception that Asian people work hard and do well, but black people don't. </p> <p>For instance, a great deal was made of the fact that Stephen Lawrence was an A-level student, as if he was not just like all those other black kids you see hanging around the streets. </p> <p>The Macpherson report brought the problem centre stage. People have paid attention to it. But what happens next?</p> <p> <b>Rabbi Julia Neuberger</b><br> The murder was horrible, but it's not in that sense a landmark. What has been really important is that the Macpherson report has brought about a change of culture. It takes a generation to change a culture, the question of sexual equality, for example, took a generation to percolate through. But the Macpherson report, importantly, has had a great effect and you can discern it only a year on. It was designed specifically as a very deliberate consciousness-raising thing which is why, perhaps, it will raise awareness more quickly. It has been almost like a punch in the face. </p> <p>I would say that the issue about racism within institutions has come to the top of the agenda. So the fact that Macpherson talks about institutionalised racism has made people aware that they need to look at their organisation in a way that, however fair-minded they were trying to be, they had not done before. I don't think we are seeing the effects yet, but we are seeing a change. </p> <p>It is more than just senior management thinking about the issue; it has brought people up short in some way. People in the health service are very aware about how few black faces there are in senior management. I would say the positive effects extend to a wider cultural awareness of other ethnic groups, such as Jewish people, and to an extent about the Irish. </p> <p>It is very difficult for governments to respond to this kind of thing, but I think they have to add to the consciousness-raising stuff. It's a question of whether the race relations legislation is strong enough. I wouldn't criticise or praise the government at this stage; they are right to continue to work on this but need to consult widely. Government shouldn't just rely on focus groups, especially with the majority that this one has. Sometimes it can take a lead.</p> <p> <b>Max Clifford, publicist</b><br> Newspaper editors are always looking to build circulation so they pay lip service to race relations, but I don't think things have really changed. Look at the percentage of black staff at most newspapers. Knowing journalists as I do, I read some of the things they write and think, my God, how can they say that? The media are hypocritical about a number of things, it's a case of what suits at the time. </p> <p>The police have suffered terrible publicity as a result of the Steven Lawrence case. I know from speaking to police officers that their morale was at an all-time low. But there's a backlash. The police have abandoned the stop-and-search policy and as a result crime has increased, so now the public are saying they should bring it back. </p> <p>I gave the Lawrence suspects free advice because I knew they'd been found guilty by the media. I didn't know whether they were innocent, but I believe that in a healthy democracy both sides of the picture are shown. You saw all the footage of them at the tribunal behaving like five thugs, but you didn't see it when they had bottles chucked at them by the crowds. </p> <p>I said, \"if you want to change the public's perception, do an interview on television and answer all the questions, but make sure it's live. Then, maybe people will change their minds.\" I introduced them to Martin Bashir. But the interview wasn't live and it was edited so that a lot of the stuff they wanted to get across wasn't in it. If they were clients I would have taken better care of them. </p> <p>The irony is that as a result of the free advice I gave I was accused of being racist. I even received death threats from black groups. How can you accuse a man who represented Mohammed Ali and stood up for OJ Simpson when everyone else was against him of being racist?</p>",

You saw all the footage of them at the tribunal behaving like five thugs, but you didn't see it when they had bottles chucked at them by the crowds. I said, \"if you want to change the public's perception, do an interview on television and answer all the questions, but make sure it's live. Then, maybe people will change their minds.\" I introduced them to Martin Bashir. But the interview wasn't live and it was edited so that a lot of the stuff they wanted to get across wasn't in it. If they were clients I would have taken better care of them. The irony is that as a result of the free advice I gave I was accused of being racist. I even received death threats from black groups. How can you accuse a man who represented Mohammed Ali and stood up for OJ Simpson when everyone else was against him of being racist?",

      "body": "<p>Now that the dust has settled and the rubble has been cleared, it is time to check the foundations. The Macpherson report fell like a bombshell on the British political and cultural landscape. Into what had appeared to be a fairly simple narrative between good (the Lawrence family) and evil (the five young men suspected of killing their son), William Macpherson introduced a new and far more complex character: institutional racism. Suddenly a term that most of England had never heard before was all over the nation's breakfast tables.</p> <p>Although the specific recommendations of the report were aimed principally at the Metropolitan police, the ramifications were far-reaching. But the inquiry's most radical contribution lay not so much in its content as in its tone and the very process by which it came about.</p> <p>In the past, to get a report written about the state of race relations in Britain, black people either had to take on the police (the Scarman report) or defend themselves against white thugs (the Salmon report). But Macpherson emerged from an incident prompted by a group of white racist louts, bungled by an overwhelmingly white police force, which sparked an investigation presided over by a white lord. This in itself was a seminal moment in British race relations. This was no longer a debate about how to contain the problems that black people cause by their very presence. This was white people talking to other white people about the problems engendered by their racism.</p> <p>All black people did was, literally and metaphorically, die for it. Stephen Lawrence died for it. Rohit Duggal, Rolan Adams, Michael Menson and many others died for it. The Lawrence family, in their tireless campaigning through the dog years when the mainstream press had lost interest, were dying for it. And the black community at large were dying for it. This was our Rodney King. At last, here was proof of what black people had been saying for years. That they have been falling foul not just of the law of the land, but of the law of probabilities; evidence that there is a persistent and consistent propensity to shove ethnic minorities to the bottom of every available pile and not only leave them there but blame them for being there as well.</p> <p>And it had the same effect on white opinion in Britain as the videotape of King's beating had on white America. In the face of incontrovertible evidence, white people were no longer able to ignore the deep-rooted and widespread nature of racism in British society even if they wanted to.</p> <p>Those who lived in most of the urban centres were confronted with the fact that, while they lived in a multicultural society, they had been experiencing a completely different reality from black people, with whom they may have been mixing every day. Suddenly they had to learn a new language. In the immediate aftermath of the report's release there was no escape. Its message and the saturation coverage it received in the media brought race into the living room, newsagent, boardroom and canteen.</p> <p>There were two general responses to this. Among some, it triggered a process of introspection; white people suddenly realised they were white in a way that they had not considered before. And they were confronted with the fact that this whiteness conferred power, privilege and responsibility. Others reacted aggressively, annoyed at the assumption (which nobody actually made) that they were condemned by virtue of their whiteness. Either way they were forced into an acute awareness of a matter that had only fluttered on the periphery of their consciousness. If the results of the Guardian/ICM poll in today's paper are anything to go by, then the outcome of this introspection has been broadly positive. The large increase in the number of those who would not mind if one of their relatives married a black person or had a black boss suggests that the most nefarious aspects of casual racism are in irreversible and rapid decline. The considerable number who would mind indicates the existence of a stubborn, racist rump.</p> <p>So Macpherson raised the potential of racial debate in this country at a crucial moment, bringing both perception and understanding of discrimination more closely in line with the reality of the black British experience. Previously, the predominant view in Britain had been that racism was a question of not being nice to certain people who happen to be black; that racists are impolite, nasty, poorly educated and badly brought up and that combating racism was just about treating everyone the same. Anti-racism, it followed, was therefore about denying difference rather than embracing it; its key determinant was not political but behavioural.</p> <p>Macpherson dealt a severe blow to that misconception. By placing institutional racism at the heart of his report he drew a direct link between the racist boot boys and the complacent pen-pushers; between the black shirts and the blue helmets. It charted a path from the crudest forms of racism to the most well concealed. In short, it exposed the way in which racism affects all areas of black people's lives and infects the institutions we are all part of. It shifted the focus of the debate from the individual to the institutional; it encompassed not just the obvious but the abstruse as well. It showed that racism does not have one face but many, and sometimes no face at all.</p> <p>But while it raised the potential of debate, not everyone has risen to the challenge. From the media, it is evident that some are still desperate to tap a popular vein of prejudice. The coverage of the \u00a350,000 damages Winston Silcott received for malicious prosecution in the Blakelock murder case (\"Silcott should rot in prison\" - Daily Mail); the Tyson visit (\"I watched tots flee in terror\" - the Sun); the Afghan hijacking (\"Oh no! They all want to stay. And we'll have to pay\" - the Star). A core of white opinion remains in denial.</p> <p>On the home affairs select committee, Conservative MP Gerald Howarth bemoaned the dispiriting effect the report had on the white psyche. \"Native Englishmen have been encouraged to get involved in a collective exercise of self-flagellation about their inadequacies with regard to race relations,\" he said. In the Telegraph an editorial accused Macpherson of having such an intimidating effect on the Met that they had scaled down their stop-and-searches on black people. \"What is racist,\" said the paper in April, \"is reducing action on the street for fear that the colour of the person involved leads to condemnation. That is a climate encouraged by the report.\" When crime figures emerged last year revealing an increase in street crime, Macpherson's influence was blamed again. Steven Norris, the Conservative mayoral candidate, wants to get rid of \"politically correct\" policing - he doesn't care that a disproportionate number of black men are stopped so long as the police are polite, he says.</p> <p>This, so far, is what has passed for a backlash: evidence of how little the right wing has been able to contribute on an intellectual level and how little there was to lash back against. Since the facts of the matter in relation to the Lawrence inquiry are not in dispute, there can only be any integrity in attacking its recommendations if you can come up with alternative suggestions of how to make sure no other family has to go through what the Lawrences went through. Failing to do so is tantamount to arguing for bad policing and inequality.</p> <p>For in all of this, Macpherson is little more than a metaphor. The battle lines are drawn far more deeply than simply those who support its findings and those who do not. It is not even just about those who feel it is time to develop a new conceptual framework for Britain's race debate and those who want to keep it where it is - although that has a lot to do with it. It has been a discussion between those who are already aware, or at least are prepared to accept, that Britain has changed and those who would or could not. The latter have either failed or refused to grasp that, even though this country will always be predominantly white, it is now impossible to imagine it without black people. Two-thirds of those of Caribbean descent, a third of those of Chinese descent, and the majority of children in every minority community were born in Britain. Indian restaurants do not only make the country's most popular dish; they employ more people than shipbuilding, steel and mining put together.</p> <p>What used to be a slogan among black protestors - \"Come what may we're here to stay,\" is now an undeniable reality. On the whole, black people no longer have to defend their right to be here because, on the whole, white people are no longer questioning it. A sense of race is no longer in conflict with a sense of place.</p> <p>So a sizeable minority is stuck in the paradigm of immigration-integration-repatriation - desperate to maintain a seamless link between Britishness and whiteness. And the rest have moved on to equal rights, economic opportunities and educational advancement. Some are still asking: \"What are we going to do about these blacks?\" Others wonder: \"What are we going to do about the racism in our institutions?\"</p> <p>But just because we are asking the right questions does not mean that we are getting the right answers. Young black people are still more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their white peers; two thirds of the Pakistani/Bangladeshi community still live among the poorest 20% of the country; graduates of African descent in their 20s are seven times as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts. The statistics go on for ever, but the grim reality they describe cannot. Macpherson has provided us with sound foundations; we must wait and see what lasting structures will be built on them.</p>",

In the Telegraph an editorial accused Macpherson of having such an intimidating effect on the Met that they had scaled down their stop-and-searches on black people. \"What is racist,\" said the paper in April, \"is reducing action on the street for fear that the colour of the person involved leads to condemnation. That is a climate encouraged by the report.\" When crime figures emerged last year revealing an increase in street crime, Macpherson's influence was blamed again. Steven Norris, the Conservative mayoral candidate, wants to get rid of \"politically correct\" policing - he doesn't care that a disproportionate number of black men are stopped so long as the police are polite, he says. This, so far, is what has passed for a backlash: evidence of how little the right wing has been able to contribute on an intellectual level and how little there was to lash back against. Since the facts of the matter in relation to the Lawrence inquiry are not in dispute, there can only be any integrity in attacking its recommendations if you can come up with alternative suggestions of how to make sure no other family has to go through what the Lawrences went through. Failing to do so is tantamount to arguing for bad policing and inequality. For in all of this, Macpherson is little more than a metaphor. The battle lines are drawn far more deeply than simply those who support its findings and those who do not. It is not even just about those who feel it is time to develop a new conceptual framework for Britain's race debate and those who want to keep it where it is - although that has a lot to do with it. It has been a discussion between those who are already aware, or at least are prepared to accept, that Britain has changed and those who would or could not. The latter have either failed or refused to grasp that, even though this country will always be predominantly white, it is now impossible to imagine it without black people. Two-thirds of those of Caribbean descent, a third of those of Chinese descent, and the majority of children in every minority community were born in Britain. Indian restaurants do not only make the country's most popular dish; they employ more people than shipbuilding, steel and mining put together. What used to be a slogan among black protestors - \"Come what may we're here to stay,\" is now an undeniable reality. On the whole, black people no longer have to defend their right to be here because, on the whole, white people are no longer questioning it. A sense of race is no longer in conflict with a sense of place. So a sizeable minority is stuck in the paradigm of immigration-integration-repatriation - desperate to maintain a seamless link between Britishness and whiteness. And the rest have moved on to equal rights, economic opportunities and educational advancement. Some are still asking: \"What are we going to do about these blacks?\" Others wonder: \"What are we going to do about the racism in our institutions?\" But just because we are asking the right questions does not mean that we are getting the right answers. Young black people are still more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their white peers; two thirds of the Pakistani/Bangladeshi community still live among the poorest 20% of the country; graduates of African descent in their 20s are seven times as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts. The statistics go on for ever, but the grim reality they describe cannot. Macpherson has provided us with sound foundations; we must wait and see what lasting structures will be built on them.",

      "body": "<p>\"We taught Macpherson and Macpherson taught the world,\" was the way a black activist who had given evidence to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry greeted its findings. For her, it was not just the report's conclusions that mattered - ordinary black people, who had borne the brunt of institutional racism knew all about it - but the fact that, due to the unrelenting campaign of the Lawrence family, they were able to get their voices heard at last.</p> <p>Little by little, as the inquiry went on and the evidence piled up, the public became aware of the level of racial violence in society; of how a police force, by virtue of its own racism, compounded the problem; of the routine miscarriages of justice to which working-class black people were subjected; of the increasing confidence, consequently, of white racists that they could do anything to black people and get away with it. Macpherson, in that sense, was not just a result. It was a learning process for the country at large and, in the course of it, the gravitational centre of race-relations discourse was shifted from individual prejudice and ethnic need to systemic racial inequality and injustice.</p> <p>Personal prejudice is not a matter of central concern to black people. They are not bothered whether a particular white person likes them or not; that is the problem of the individual concerned. But when such prejudice is acted out in socially discriminatory ways so as to become racial discrimination, it does concern them that they cannot get their child into the school of their choice or that they cannot buy the house they can afford. And it is when such discrimination becomes embodied in the apparatuses of the state that racism becomes institutionalised.</p> <p>Institutional racism had never before been acknowledged by government or by official inquiry. In fact, Lord Scarman, appointed by the Thatcher government to look into the causes of the Brixton riots of 1981, had declared that there was no such thing as institutional racism, only personal prejudice, which \"does manifest itself occasionally in the behaviour of a few police officers on the street\".</p> <p>Macpherson, however, was unequivocal: the Metropolitan police force was institutionally racist - as were other institutions in society. Ways had to be found to police racist crimes more effectively. Here was a significant new codification of racism, even a significant new tone of (muted) outrage - and a call to the government to bring the \"full force of the race relations legislation\" to bear on \"all police officers\". Clearly, what Macpherson had intended was that the provisions of the race relations act of 1976, which related to both direct (overt) discrimination as well as indirect (institutional) discrimination and from which the police had been exempted, should now be extended to cover them. And, in the first flush of acclaim for setting up the inquiry, the home secretary agreed to extend the race relations act not just to the police force but to all public bodies too. The prime minister declared his commitment to \"drive home a programme of change\". Institutional racism, it appeared, was an issue that the government was determined to pursue.</p> <p>But in the Queen's speech in November, it was announced that the race relations act would be extended to the police and other public bodies only in relation to direct discrimination - thereby leaving institutional racism in crucial areas. Only the public outcry that ensued forced the home secretary to retreat and accept that indirect discrimination should be targeted in government bodies as well.</p> <p>The auguries, however, are that any such legislation would be made ineffectual by operational conceits and caveats on the one hand. And on the other, it would be undermined by the way the government is indirectly bringing discrimination into other areas of public life - through the bills on freedom of information, jury trial and terrorism.</p> <p>But that is New Labour for you. It faces both ways at once. Inevitably, because it has no principles, only policies; no ideology, only programmes. Everything it does is ad hoc, majoritarian, opportunist. To shift something as ingrained as racism is in British society requires commitment, passion, a visceral hatred of injustice.</p> <p>Take the matter of police operations. Although \"performance indicators\" - for specialist training and targets on ethnic recruitment to the force - may be in place, the performance on the ground for the black community is racism as usual. Nothing has been done to dismantle stop-and-search, in which young black men are six times more likely than their white counterparts to be picked up. Except that, if the recent \"stops\" of Neville Lawrence, Bishop Sentamu and Lord Taylor are anything to go by, the practice has been extended to cover middle-aged, middle-class blacks as well. (To the copper on the street, colour is classless.)</p> <p>Nor does the policing of racial violence - to which almost half of the 70 recommendations in the Macpherson report is devoted - show much change in the areas that matter. The families of Michael Menson, Ricky Reel and Kofi Hodasi have all had to go through the same travail of police prevarication, fobbings-off and denial, and bring their cause before the public, as the Lawrences had, before the police would even acknowledge the possibility of racially motivated murder and investigate the case as such.</p> <p>The freedom of information bill institutionalises such indifference by exempting the police from having to make full disclosure of their actions in all areas of policing, as recommended by Macpherson. Worse, it has shut the door once more on police accountability. If the Lawrences' long struggle highlighted anything, it was the way the police withheld vital information, covered up for one another, closed ranks, and took no responsibility for their mistakes. But still it continues, with the Mensons, Reels, McGowans, and Chhokars having to go through the same humiliating confrontations.</p> <p>The withholding of information, however, does not stop at deaths involving racial violence; it extends to deaths in custody. At least five black people have lost their lives in suspicious circumstances in police custody in the last year. But for the families of those who die in police or prison, the quest to find out how someone died has become near impossible. The lesson is clear. Without freedom of information, there is no accountability; without accountability, no justice.</p> <p>Similarly, the bill (thrown out by the Lords but due to be reintroduced) to abolish the right of defendants to elect to be tried by a jury for offences such as minor theft, assault and criminal damage, will have a greater impact on black people since they are overrepresented in these areas If passed, it will further institutionalise racism in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>So too with the proposal in the new prevention of terrorism bill to extend its remit to domestic groups which threaten violence to advance \"a political, religious or ideological cause\". This will impact more heavily on refugees fighting the tyrannies they have fled and black groups fighting organised racism. And the asylum and immigration act, with its \"commonsense\" arguments for treating asylum-seekers as a species apart and enclosing them in a cordon sanitaire , dissolves racism into xenophobia and makes it appear reasonable.</p> <p>If the government has shown little earnest about dismantling institutional racism, non-governmental agencies have seized the opportunity to tackle racism in their organisations. For 20 years, through Thatcher's onslaught on left-wing local authorities which were beginning to address issues of racial justice, these organisations floundered in a morass of Scarmanite ethnic programmes, all too readily promoted by an emerging ethnic middle class.</p> <p>In the process, the fight against racism was transformed into a fight for culture, the fight against a system into a fight for the individual. Smash-and-grab ethnic politics came to replace community self-reliance and inward-looking preoccupations with the self became elevated to a politics of identity. Ethnic programmes, with their skin counts and internecine rivalries, debased equal opportunity into equal opportunism. Meanwhile, identity politics descended into the politics of victimisation - from \"who you are is what you do\" to \"who you are is what is done to you\". People pulled rank in a hierarchy of oppressions.</p> <p>But now Macpherson had put anti-racism back on the agenda - and in the year since the report there has been a flurry of activity on tackling racism. Sadly, though, most organisations keep falling back on old established palliatives as an off-the-peg blue-print for every problem and every occasion.</p> <p>The point, however, is not to look to Macpherson for a solution. It is enough that it has put institutional racism on the map and drawn attention to its prevalence in society. The challenge for such organisations, then, is to examine their particular roles, the context in which they work and the way in which racism has developed in their fields. Racism has become ingrained in different ways in different institutions - and has therefore to be fought specifically, in terms of the specific policies, practices and procedures of a specific institution.</p> <p>But the non-governmental sector does not operate in a vacuum. It is influenced and guided by the political culture around it. And it is the state which - through its laws and its edicts, its administration of the public services - sets the tone and tenor, the climate, of race relations in society. By refusing, therefore, to examine and outlaw the racism in its own structures, the state gives a fillip to popular racism and embeds it in popular culture. Since public officers such as the police are drawn from that society and culture, the virus of racism is carried back into the body politic. State racism contaminates civil society.</p> <p>Hence the fight against institutional racism is a fight against state racism - against asylum laws, against deportations, against stop-and-search, against deaths in custody, against school exclusions, against miscarriages of justice. Which, in turn, calls into question the larger issues of accountability, freedom of information and judicial impartiality that constitute the fundamentals of democracy. In the final analysis, institutional racism is the litmus test of a society's democracy.</p> <p>Ambalavaner Sivanandan is director of the Institute of Race Relations.</p>",

But when such prejudice is acted out in socially discriminatory ways so as to become racial discrimination, it does concern them that they cannot get their child into the school of their choice or that they cannot buy the house they can afford. And it is when such discrimination becomes embodied in the apparatuses of the state that racism becomes institutionalised. Institutional racism had never before been acknowledged by government or by official inquiry. In fact, Lord Scarman, appointed by the Thatcher government to look into the causes of the Brixton riots of 1981, had declared that there was no such thing as institutional racism, only personal prejudice, which \"does manifest itself occasionally in the behaviour of a few police officers on the street\". Macpherson, however, was unequivocal: the Metropolitan police force was institutionally racist - as were other institutions in society. Ways had to be found to police racist crimes more effectively. Here was a significant new codification of racism, even a significant new tone of (muted) outrage - and a call to the government to bring the \"full force of the race relations legislation\" to bear on \"all police officers\". Clearly, what Macpherson had intended was that the provisions of the race relations act of 1976, which related to both direct (overt) discrimination as well as indirect (institutional) discrimination and from which the police had been exempted, should now be extended to cover them. And, in the first flush of acclaim for setting up the inquiry, the home secretary agreed to extend the race relations act not just to the police force but to all public bodies too. The prime minister declared his commitment to \"drive home a programme of change\". Institutional racism, it appeared, was an issue that the government was determined to pursue. But in the Queen's speech in November, it was announced that the race relations act would be extended to the police and other public bodies only in relation to direct discrimination - thereby leaving institutional racism in crucial areas. Only the public outcry that ensued forced the home secretary to retreat and accept that indirect discrimination should be targeted in government bodies as well. The auguries, however, are that any such legislation would be made ineffectual by operational conceits and caveats on the one hand. And on the other, it would be undermined by the way the government is indirectly bringing discrimination into other areas of public life - through the bills on freedom of information, jury trial and terrorism. But that is New Labour for you. It faces both ways at once. Inevitably, because it has no principles, only policies; no ideology, only programmes. Everything it does is ad hoc, majoritarian, opportunist. To shift something as ingrained as racism is in British society requires commitment, passion, a visceral hatred of injustice. Take the matter of police operations. Although \"performance indicators\" - for specialist training and targets on ethnic recruitment to the force - may be in place, the performance on the ground for the black community is racism as usual. Nothing has been done to dismantle stop-and-search, in which young black men are six times more likely than their white counterparts to be picked up. Except that, if the recent \"stops\" of Neville Lawrence, Bishop Sentamu and Lord Taylor are anything to go by, the practice has been extended to cover middle-aged, middle-class blacks as well. (To the copper on the street, colour is classless.) Nor does the policing of racial violence - to which almost half of the 70 recommendations in the Macpherson report is devoted - show much change in the areas that matter. The families of Michael Menson, Ricky Reel and Kofi Hodasi have all had to go through the same travail of police prevarication, fobbings-off and denial, and bring their cause before the public, as the Lawrences had, before the police would even acknowledge the possibility of racially motivated murder and investigate the case as such. The freedom of information bill institutionalises such indifference by exempting the police from having to make full disclosure of their actions in all areas of policing, as recommended by Macpherson. Worse, it has shut the door once more on police accountability. If the Lawrences' long struggle highlighted anything, it was the way the police withheld vital information, covered up for one another, closed ranks, and took no responsibility for their mistakes. But still it continues, with the Mensons, Reels, McGowans, and Chhokars having to go through the same humiliating confrontations. The withholding of information, however, does not stop at deaths involving racial violence; it extends to deaths in custody. At least five black people have lost their lives in suspicious circumstances in police custody in the last year. But for the families of those who die in police or prison, the quest to find out how someone died has become near impossible. The lesson is clear. Without freedom of information, there is no accountability; without accountability, no justice. Similarly, the bill (thrown out by the Lords but due to be reintroduced) to abolish the right of defendants to elect to be tried by a jury for offences such as minor theft, assault and criminal damage, will have a greater impact on black people since they are overrepresented in these areas If passed, it will further institutionalise racism in the criminal justice system. So too with the proposal in the new prevention of terrorism bill to extend its remit to domestic groups which threaten violence to advance \"a political, religious or ideological cause\". This will impact more heavily on refugees fighting the tyrannies they have fled and black groups fighting organised racism. And the asylum and immigration act, with its \"commonsense\" arguments for treating asylum-seekers as a species apart and enclosing them in a cordon sanitaire , dissolves racism into xenophobia and makes it appear reasonable. If the government has shown little earnest about dismantling institutional racism, non-governmental agencies have seized the opportunity to tackle racism in their organisations. For 20 years, through Thatcher's onslaught on left-wing local authorities which were beginning to address issues of racial justice, these organisations floundered in a morass of Scarmanite ethnic programmes, all too readily promoted by an emerging ethnic middle class. In the process, the fight against racism was transformed into a fight for culture, the fight against a system into a fight for the individual. Smash-and-grab ethnic politics came to replace community self-reliance and inward-looking preoccupations with the self became elevated to a politics of identity. Ethnic programmes, with their skin counts and internecine rivalries, debased equal opportunity into equal opportunism. Meanwhile, identity politics descended into the politics of victimisation - from \"who you are is what you do\" to \"who you are is what is done to you\". People pulled rank in a hierarchy of oppressions. But now Macpherson had put anti-racism back on the agenda - and in the year since the report there has been a flurry of activity on tackling racism. Sadly, though, most organisations keep falling back on old established palliatives as an off-the-peg blue-print for every problem and every occasion. The point, however, is not to look to Macpherson for a solution. It is enough that it has put institutional racism on the map and drawn attention to its prevalence in society. The challenge for such organisations, then, is to examine their particular roles, the context in which they work and the way in which racism has developed in their fields. Racism has become ingrained in different ways in different institutions - and has therefore to be fought specifically, in terms of the specific policies, practices and procedures of a specific institution. But the non-governmental sector does not operate in a vacuum. It is influenced and guided by the political culture around it. And it is the state which - through its laws and its edicts, its administration of the public services - sets the tone and tenor, the climate, of race relations in society. By refusing, therefore, to examine and outlaw the racism in its own structures, the state gives a fillip to popular racism and embeds it in popular culture. Since public officers such as the police are drawn from that society and culture, the virus of racism is carried back into the body politic. State racism contaminates civil society. Hence the fight against institutional racism is a fight against state racism - against asylum laws, against deportations, against stop-and-search, against deaths in custody, against school exclusions, against miscarriages of justice. Which, in turn, calls into question the larger issues of accountability, freedom of information and judicial impartiality that constitute the fundamentals of democracy. In the final analysis, institutional racism is the litmus test of a society's democracy. Ambalavaner Sivanandan is director of the Institute of Race Relations.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has identified two new suspects whom detectives believe may have been involved in the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The two are believed to be associates of the five prime suspects in the unsolved racist stabbing of the black teenager at a south London bus stop in April 1993. The development comes as detectives led by the Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner, John Grieve, grow increasingly confident of being able to bring charges over the murder. The case is being handled by CO24, the race and violent crimes task force that was set up by the Met after it was branded institutionally racist by Sir William Macpherson in a public inquiry into why the force's murder investigation had been so flawed. One of the two new suspects is the \"fair haired\" attacker identified by some witnesses. Both suspects have never been interviewed over the murder by police. The development comes days before the first anniversary of the publication of Sir William's findings, which rocked Scotland Yard. Doreen Lawrence, mother of the dead teenager, told a meeting on Saturday marking the anniversary that she did not believe the police when they promised they had learned the lessons of the scandal. She said: \"I have concerns as to how and when any of the recommendations are going to be implemented.\" According to a Guardian/ICM opinion poll published today, a majority of the public believes the police are learning from the mistakes they made during the murder investigation. A total of 75% of those polled believe the police are making progress, and only 12% disagree. This large vote of confidence in the police approach to racial attacks comes after a weekend in which the Lawrence family's solicitor, Imran Khan, said that the police had not changed. \"For the Lawrences, there appears to be too much talk and too little action. Committees and advisory groups are all well and good, but they end up as talking shops. What is most galling for the Lawrences is they see police forces up and down the country not changing, not learning lessons. \"It is the same old story of officers criminalising the black victim, not taking race crime seriously,\" Mr Khan told the meeting in central London. But the Guardian/ICM poll results show that fewer people believe the police are racist than did a year ago. A clear majority, 57%, believes that most officers \"tend not to be racist\" or are \"not racist at all\". Those who believe the majority of police officers are not racist at all has jumped 10 points from 20% to 30%, as compared with a similar Guardian/ICM poll in February 1999. Only 18% believe that most police officers \"tend to be racist\". A significant minority - nearly one in three - shares the analysis of the official inquiry report that the police do have a problem with institutional racism. Although 49% disagree, some 30% do believe that, whatever their intentions, the way that the police operate leads them to discriminate unfairly against black and Asian people. Although this is a slight fall compared with 12 months ago, it shows that a significant section of the public believes that the police have not yet tackled the problem of indirect or institutional racism. ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,205 adults aged over 18 by telephone between February 11 and 13, 2000.

The centre right went from 54.7% to 55.5% across the same 50 years.</p> <p>But if the overall balance between left and centre right has remained stable, the two camps have reshuffled. On the left, support for social democratic parties has fallen from 33.6% to just less than 30%, while support for communist parties has fallen from almost 8% to just 3.5%. The balance has been made up by various new left parties, such as the socialist left parties in Scandinavia, as well as by the pervasive green parties, which polled an average of almost 5% across western Europe as a whole in the 90s. But while the left has become more fragmented over time, strategically it is now in a stronger position. As the left coalitions in Germany and Italy prove, it is a lot easier to transform this new balance of forces into a winning coalition than was the case when leftwing support was simply divided between socialists and communists.</p> <p>Reshuffling on the centre right has proved less advantageous. Electoral support for christian democratic parties has been cut by a third - the most dramatic decline experienced by any of the party families. Support for the extreme right had jumped to an average of more than 6% in the 90s. This is the western Europe average; it was already far more than this in the 90s in Austria, as well as in Belgium, France, Italy and Norway.

So far, only Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel in Austria and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy have bitten the bullet and opted for the first solution. But the ball may already have fallen in the pariahs' court.

Many newspapers and magazines in 2000, especially those in the US, look decidedly different from a decade ago. </p> <p>Some of the changes wrought by the internet are superficial. Magazine typography now commonly includes underscored and/or coloured words, bringing a notion of \"click here\" in a non-interactive medium, notes Roger Black, the celebrated American publication designer, who works on print publications and websites as chief creative director for Circle.com.

The success of online media is also changing the content of newspapers and magazines. </p> <p>Black says that print publishers are coming to understand that most consumers don't spend the time that they used to with any printed publication. Much as publishers may wish it, consumers rarely curl up in a comfy chair and read lengthy stories. There's too much other stuff demanding their attention. So it's essential to have summaries of articles for quick information hits.

He means that the typical newspaper is adding more and more elements to its pages - especially front pages. </p> <p>The newspaper of yore might have offered three to five stories on the front page, presented as the most important news of the day. But today, newspapers can't get away with that approach. Instead, they offer more alternatives for readers; shorter stories; more graphics; more sidebars; more navigation devices to direct readers to inside-the-paper content; more stuff to appease readers' short attention spans. </p> <p>Just like a web page, newspaper and magazine pages are offering more \"external links\" to content. Print publications are offering more snippets of information that instruct the reader to dial a phone number, send an email, or go online to get related information. The be-all and end-all news story is a thing of the past, says Meyer. Today's savvy publisher realises that when the world is a web of information, the printed page is just one site. </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant change for print is that it is no longer a dominant medium where consumers get breaking news. When the daily paper reports on a train crash, the majority of its readers have already seen it reported on TV - and a fast-growing number have gone online to get the news in greater depth. </p> <p>What that means, say the publication design gurus, is that newspapers and magazines must get better at providing analysis and context, because their readers won't care if all that's offered is what was reported by digital media yesterday. Once, television influenced newspapers in this way, but the common refrain was that broadcast news could offer only headlines but no depth. For depth, you had to wait for tomorrow's newspaper. But with online media, you get both headlines and depth. </p> <p> What does the savvy print publication look like today then, and what will it look like in the future? \"A printed newspaper, where there has traditionally been a beginning and an end, a sense of closure, may only publish several inches of an interview, but the editor will refer readers to the website, where the entire interview may appear,\" says Garcia. The newspaper of tomorrow will be an assortment of news snippets and referrals to content elsewhere, plus insightful analysis and commentary that online media does not provide. It won't be your father's newspaper. </p> <p>And the consumers of the future may consume multiple media in a constant effort to keep up with the news.

The newspaper of tomorrow will be an assortment of news snippets and referrals to content elsewhere, plus insightful analysis and commentary that online media does not provide. It won't be your father's newspaper. And the consumers of the future may consume multiple media in a constant effort to keep up with the news. The sole newspaper or magazine will not be enough - publications will encourage their readers to look beyond the printed page. \u0095 Steve Outing is a Colorado-based journalist and columnist who covers internet media trends for Editor &amp; Publisher and Writer's Digest.

      "body": "<p>Internet surfers trying to log on last week to the San Francisco-based internet magazine Salon.com were in for a surprise. They found themselves at Slate, its Microsoft-owned rival based several hundred miles north in Redmond, Washington. A mistake? In the suspicious world of web magazines some are saying not. The two duelling webzines are locked in competition as acrimonious as any afflicting their terrestrial, print-and-paper cousins. Maybe the Salon/ Slate confusion for people logging on was more than just an internet blip. But then again, maybe it wasn't. </p> <p>In recent weeks, Slate's editor, Michael Kinsley, has accused Salon of inflating readership in the battle to get advertising and of stooping to low reporting methods in search of a story. Generally they were \"whoring\" around for buzz. Hitting back, Salon's editor, David Talbot, accused Slate of being dull and sexless, of merely dissecting news without breaking stories. Kinsley was accused of being \"Bill Gates' house pet\". </p> <p>Of course, the duel is not just a confrontation between two organisations with differing ideas about how an internet magazine should be (Salon - sassy, independent, anti-establisment; Slate - steadier, more business orientated, always wary of what investors might think). There is also the big play for the wider public attention that both crave. </p> <p>The substance of the feud lies in Salon's claim that it's now getting 3.4m readers a month, a 433% gain over December 1998, and a figure Slate says is dubious and probably generated by multiple visits by the same readers. \"I'll say categorically that Salon did not have 3.4m people reading their website in December,\" says Slate's publisher, Scott Moore. \"I don't question that Salon had 3.4m browsers connected to their network but there's no way they could know how many people that represents.\" </p> <p>Salon's vice-president, Patrick Hurley, responded that Slate was suffering from sour grapes: \"When was the last time you heard someone talk about Slate?\" Kinsley, former editor of Harper's and the New Republic, retorted that Slate got plenty of buzz \"without whoring after it\". Talbot, former editor of the San Francisco Examiner's arts section, shot back that perhaps Kinsley could use a bit of whoring. The battle has gone backwards and forwards. </p> <p>According to Slate's figures, the number of visitors to Salon surpassed Slate's for the first time only in December (Slate's numbers, audited Mediamatrix, were around 1m; Salon's, 1.4m). \"All I can tell you is that these 3.4m were unique IDs,\" says Andrew Ross, Salon's executive vice-president of strategic development. \"As much as Michael Kinsley might like to think we're fudging figures, we don't and we can't because we're a public company.\" </p> <p>The bad blood stems not just from the disputed figures but from a number of Salon's recent escapades that have gained national attention. But it was a story by Dan Savage, a gay writer who writes an explicit sex column on such subjects as genital cosmetic surgery for transsexuals, that drew Kinsley's accusations of whoring. For the story, Savage went to Iowa to work as a volunteer on the campaign for far-right presidential candidate Gary Bauer. In \"Stalking Gary Bauer\", Savage wrote that while having flu, he licked doorknobs and cups at Bauer's campaign headquarters and handed the candidate [who has since abandoned the race] a pen covered in saliva to try to infect him. </p> <p>Though Savage now claims the story of his exploits was a joke, he is being investigated for voter fraud after casting a vote in the Iowa caucuses. Savage's playful attempt to derail Bauer highlights the editorial difference in approach between Salon and Slate. </p> <p>Slate has always billed itself as a place of refuge in a whirlwind of content. The site features more political punditry and informed analysis of the news - what Kinsley calls \"meta-features\" - than its rival and in many ways acts more like a salon than Salon, posting email discourses between contributors and offering summaries of current events. Salon, by contrast, is more active in breaking stories. And although some of Salon's stories don't quite stand up - the recent \"scandal\" over the White House drug policy office lacing network sitcoms with anti-drug messages, for instance - it has managed to carve itself a reputation for breaking stories and providing sexier, more irreverent fare than Slate. </p> <p>As a funded child of the Microsoft Network, Slate is not under the same financial pressures as Salon. With a staff of 35 to Salon's 100, it's 90% funded by ad revenue, says Moore. Since dropping a plan to charge subscription a year ago, advertising revenue has risen sixfold on the previous fiscal year. \"If it doubles again Slate will be profitable,\" he says. </p> <p>Since its inception in 1995, Salon has begun to build what looks like a network. It currently comprises 10 subject-specific, demographically targeted sites within its main portal and a variety of online communities designed to attract premium internet advertisers and e-commerce partners. </p> <p>For the three months ending in December, revenue from 150 advertisers (including major brands such as Lexus, IBM, Microsoft) was $3m (\u00a32m), up 193% from a year ago. It has entered into content-for-carriage deals with AOL, Lycos, Looksmart, TheStreet.com, Reuters, CNN.com and Cnet. This year it will launch a TV show on the Bravo cable channel. According to executive vice-president Ross, Salon is just over a year away from profitability. </p> <p>As the technology evolves, both Salon and Slate are looking to stream video and radio, as well as to transmit to a new generation of magazine-sized tablet hand-held PCs. At that point they will begin to compete directly with old media, looking to establish themselves as digital content providers. Slate and Salon already have higher online readerships than Time and Newsweek and both see themselves competing more and more with old media. \"It remains to be seen whether putting an old brand on a new platform is going to work,\" says Ross. \"They all think that but it's not necessarily so. An internet audience is looking for something new . . . and if they weren't I don't know that we'd have 3.4m users.\" </p> <p>Moore echoes this: \"The beauty of where we are is that we already have an interactive sensibility so as these new devices and formats proliferate we're better positioned to take advantage than traditional media companies that haven't done particularly well on the internet yet.\" </p> <p>Competition among internet-only publications is also growing, but neither Slate nor Salon voice any concern. They are, perhaps, too involved in their own rivalry, which Moore concedes has got Slate's \"competitive juices flowing. \"December was a blip and we expect to be back on top when the January numbers come in.\"</p>",

Ofsted's reaction yesterday was churlish. It is a rare honour to become a librettist's inspiration in your own lifetime.

      "bodyText": "The trouble with critics who lay into \"popular culture\" - such as schools chief Chris Woodhead the other day - is that classic culture is not exactly replete with uplift and correct behaviour. Take opera. The canon revels in blasphemy (Tannh\u00e4user), incest (Valkyrie), torture (Turandot) and child abuse (Peter Grimes); there is devil worship (Mefistofele), sex with ghosts (Flying Dutchman), fairies (Rusalka) and goddesses (Pearl Fishers). By comparison modern opera - aliens, fellatio and the murder of disabled people - is tame. But now, it seems, a truly offensive scenario is being adapted in which a teacher makes love to a pupil. This is the subject of a Glyndebourne collaboration in a series designed to appeal to a young audience. Could the plot have been inspired by the suggestion that once upon a time the chief inspector of schools himself was involved in a not dissimilar set of events? Ofsted's reaction yesterday was churlish. It is a rare honour to become a librettist's inspiration in your own lifetime. To that illustrious roster Bluebeard, King Herod, Don Giovanni, Count Almaviva, Fafner and Pinkerton may now be added the name... Woodhead.",

The fear of a nation wondering - in a week where their indicted leader sought to extend his iron grip - who will be gunned down next. People can't quite believe that their swaggering capital has been turned into Dodge City; that after Arkan, Belgrade's warlord king, it would only be a matter of weeks before Pavle Bulatovic, the defence minister, was assassinated as well. Who, for God's sake, is safe anymore?</p> <p>Are gangland-style murders now the order of the day? Is lawless Serbia being shoved, as the opposition so frequently predicts, into all-out civil war?</p> <p>None of my Serbian friends are keen to broach the subject openly. Even the news that the west is about to renew air links with the Balkan state has failed to cheer them up. But over family meals these are the questions they have begun to ask.</p> <p>\"Things are getting really spooky,\" says Sonja, yet another Belgrader who dreams of department stores, discotheques, bottled perfumes and bright lights. \"Big Daddy's made sure that everyone's on the look-out. They say opposition politicians are now sleeping with pistols under their pillows.\"</p> <p>Not that you'd believe it. Turn on the state-run RTS, (for most Serbs the only alternative to the white fuzz that creeps over independent channels at news-time) and you'd think you were in a theme park of happy nation builders. Serbia may be a shadow of its former self but as Slobodan Milosevic pronounced in a rare public appearance last week, it is on the mend.</p> <p>Heroic reconstruction, the line goes, is putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. Almost one year after the Nato bombing campaign - and with the aid of black market funds - bridges, factories and military installations are being fixed, Milosevic says, \"at the same speed with which the Nato missiles destroyed them.\" The financial apocalypse that many fear is, officials argue, just a figment of the imagination.</p> <p>B ut patience is wearing thin. The queues for visas at foreign embassies are getting longer. Lucky Serbs take home \u00a325 a month -not enough to enjoy a joint of meat or bowl of fruit. The mafiosi who run the state-controlled black market may live in conspicuous wealth but over half of the population is below poverty level. In Belgrade young Serbs spend entire days in public libraries and cyber-cafes to keep warm.</p> <p>Despite fears of renewed repression, the criticism of the regime can be as biting as the cold winds that cut through the capital. \"Every day is a battle for survival,\" says Milan Petrovic, a screenwriter who regards it as one of life's daily rituals to stand on his balcony bellowing \"Milosevic you bastard go!\" \"We live in a sick, criminal society,\" he laments. \"You try to laugh but it's hard to stay normal.\"</p> <p>It is in the name of normality that EU foreign ministers last week debated continuing sanctions against Serbia. Apart from exterminating the middle class (hence no revolution), enriching Milosevic's men and pauperising the masses, the embargo has enabled the president to tap into the wall of resentment that now encases his people.</p> <p>In spite of the west's move to hit the ruling elite with yet more sanctions, few think change will come soon. Worse, many have come to fear it.</p> <p>Milosevic may be the most hated politician - polls show that over 80% of the population would like the \"invisible man\" to go. And in their dreams many Serbs may wish on him a Ceausescu-style demise. The reality, however, is that in the absence of a strong, viable alternative, Serbia looks likely to be lumbered with Slobo for some time yet.</p>",

None of my Serbian friends are keen to broach the subject openly. Even the news that the west is about to renew air links with the Balkan state has failed to cheer them up. But over family meals these are the questions they have begun to ask. \"Things are getting really spooky,\" says Sonja, yet another Belgrader who dreams of department stores, discotheques, bottled perfumes and bright lights. \"Big Daddy's made sure that everyone's on the look-out. They say opposition politicians are now sleeping with pistols under their pillows.\" Not that you'd believe it. Turn on the state-run RTS, (for most Serbs the only alternative to the white fuzz that creeps over independent channels at news-time) and you'd think you were in a theme park of happy nation builders. Serbia may be a shadow of its former self but as Slobodan Milosevic pronounced in a rare public appearance last week, it is on the mend. Heroic reconstruction, the line goes, is putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. Almost one year after the Nato bombing campaign - and with the aid of black market funds - bridges, factories and military installations are being fixed, Milosevic says, \"at the same speed with which the Nato missiles destroyed them.\" The financial apocalypse that many fear is, officials argue, just a figment of the imagination. B ut patience is wearing thin. The queues for visas at foreign embassies are getting longer. Lucky Serbs take home \u00a325 a month -not enough to enjoy a joint of meat or bowl of fruit. The mafiosi who run the state-controlled black market may live in conspicuous wealth but over half of the population is below poverty level. In Belgrade young Serbs spend entire days in public libraries and cyber-cafes to keep warm. Despite fears of renewed repression, the criticism of the regime can be as biting as the cold winds that cut through the capital. \"Every day is a battle for survival,\" says Milan Petrovic, a screenwriter who regards it as one of life's daily rituals to stand on his balcony bellowing \"Milosevic you bastard go!\" \"We live in a sick, criminal society,\" he laments. \"You try to laugh but it's hard to stay normal.\" It is in the name of normality that EU foreign ministers last week debated continuing sanctions against Serbia. Apart from exterminating the middle class (hence no revolution), enriching Milosevic's men and pauperising the masses, the embargo has enabled the president to tap into the wall of resentment that now encases his people. In spite of the west's move to hit the ruling elite with yet more sanctions, few think change will come soon. Worse, many have come to fear it. Milosevic may be the most hated politician - polls show that over 80% of the population would like the \"invisible man\" to go. And in their dreams many Serbs may wish on him a Ceausescu-style demise. The reality, however, is that in the absence of a strong, viable alternative, Serbia looks likely to be lumbered with Slobo for some time yet.",

I can't believe I have been sacked for that. It's a nightmare for me as it was a dream job. Now I don't know what I'm going to do.\" The newspaper reported that Ms Traub, originally from Germany, was involved in preparing food at Sandringham. It said that when she speculated about the ease of poisoning the Queen to another kitchen hand it was passed off as an offhand comment. But when she repeated it a few days later, and asked where cyanide could be obtained, she was reported to senior staff. No police action was taken against Ms Traub, who was escorted from the Sandringham estate after her dismissal. Buckingham Palace confirmed the sacking but would not give any further details. Ms Traub, who is staying with friends in Addlestone, Surrey, told the newspaper: \"I've been in trouble before but nothing like this. I can't believe this has happened to me. I think people have been deliberately nasty, so I have lost my job. \"I've hardly slept since this thing happened. I wanted this job to last and last. It is the best job I've ever had, and now I'm left with nothing.\"",

The Nixon administration wanted ammunition to deport Lennon, who moved to the US in the early 1970s and campaigned against the Vietnam war The MI5 file is believed to contain claims that Lennon helped to fund the Workers Revolutionary Party in Britain, paying \u00a346,000 to the Trotskyist group whose supporters included the actress Vanessa Redgrave, and also gave money to Red Mole, a Marxist magazine edited by Tariq Ali, the former leftwing student leader. Mr Ali has denied receiving money from Lennon. The disclosure follows a US court order at the weekend ordering the FBI to release two letters and notes from a phone conversation. The order could trigger the release of other secret papers on the musician. The release was prompted by a 17-year campaign by the author and historian John Wiener, who tabled a legal request three years after Lennon's murder in 1980 for all US government documents on him. \"We don't think that the national security is really at stake here,\" Mr Wiener said outside court. \"We think this is 30-year-old, trivial information about the activities of a dead rock star.\" Mr Wiener said the order, by Judge Brian Robbins, for the release of the three documents was \"one step towards the eventual release of the 10 remaining documents of the John Lennon FBI file\". MI5 is believed to have had a mole in the WRP but it is unlikely that he or she could be identified by the MI5 file passed to the FBI. It was reported yesterday that MI5 held back some information from the FBI, fearing - rightly - that it would eventually be made public under the US freedom of information act. According to the former MI5 officer, David Shayler, the British security service files also say that Lennon gave money to the official IRA, before it split in the early 1970s, when the Provisional IRA - responsible for the subsequent terrorist campaign - was formed. The official IRA was a marxist organisation infliltrated in MI5's view, according to files recently released at the public record office, by communists. After it received the MI5 documents, the FBI stepped up its surveillance of Lennon and Yoko Ono in New York, with its agents even transcribing the lyrics of songs Lennon sang at demonstrations. Lennon participated in Troops Out marches in Britain. After Bloody Sunday on January 30 1972, Lennon said: \"If it's a choice between the IRA and the British army, I am with the IRA.\" Shortly afterwards at a rally organised by the US Transport Workers Union attended by members of the IRA, Lennon issued a statement saying he was protesting \"against the killing of Irish people in the civil rights movement\". Later that year he wrote the song, The Luck Of The Irish, dedicated to the victims of Bloody Sunday. The song appeared on the album Sometime in New York City, and proceeds were donated to the Irish civil rights movement. Mr Shayler has written a statement to support attempts by Mr Wiener, a history professor in California, to get the US court to release the MI5 documents.

Whereas Michael Apted's sample in Seven Up shared the same background, Winston's set is carefully weighted on the basis of wages, race, domestic arrangements and - most crucially - DNA.

Will the offspring of the rich family or the poor do best at school and in the workplace? </p> <p>The first episode suggests that this is a highly promising project which nicely balances ah-diddums moments with laboratory knowledge.

The quantity of X-years-ago-shows is one of the most common complaints to viewer and listener access series. But at least those programmes marked external events: wars, elections, the fall of walls. It's even more irritating when executives stick a birthday cake in their own navel. </p> <p>But celebrations of an entirely internal anniversary - the passing of 15 years since BBC1 first screened EastEnders - enter their second week today: a level of commemoration which even the Second World War merits only for the larger landmark decades. In the next five days, the standard weekly 90 minutes of the show will be screened, but there will be five hours of Happy Birthday EastEnders (11am, daily, BBC1), live from the set of the soap opera. Ex-cast members will \"drop by\" and viewers can vote in a series of polls including the programme's \"top bombshells\". </p> <p>EastEnders is important. One of my own favourite theories - delivered at the end of long shoots when conditions of rest and refreshment have not been ideal - is that the residents of Albert Square may have saved the BBC from Thatcher at the mid-80s peak of her power. Lacking popular shows, the BBC struggled to maintain the case for the universal licence fee. The huge audiences delivered by EastEnders probably got the Corporation sorted (as the Fowlers, Watts and Mitchells taught us to say) in the eyes of the Tories. </p> <p>Even so, this jamboree across the schedules feels as forced and self-glorifying as the celebrations of a dictator's birthday. Most shockingly, the series is co-hosted by Jeremy Spake, the camp Aeroflot official from the docusoap Airport, who the BBC is trying to turn into a presenter.

      "bodyText": "I once worked with a TV producer who - at the end of a long shoot, when they had not perhaps achieved the ideal balance of rest and refreshment - became obsessed with discovering the first programme ever made to mark an anniversary and producing a series to mark the birthday of that broadcast. The quantity of X-years-ago-shows is one of the most common complaints to viewer and listener access series. But at least those programmes marked external events: wars, elections, the fall of walls. It's even more irritating when executives stick a birthday cake in their own navel. But celebrations of an entirely internal anniversary - the passing of 15 years since BBC1 first screened EastEnders - enter their second week today: a level of commemoration which even the Second World War merits only for the larger landmark decades. In the next five days, the standard weekly 90 minutes of the show will be screened, but there will be five hours of Happy Birthday EastEnders (11am, daily, BBC1), live from the set of the soap opera. Ex-cast members will \"drop by\" and viewers can vote in a series of polls including the programme's \"top bombshells\". EastEnders is important. One of my own favourite theories - delivered at the end of long shoots when conditions of rest and refreshment have not been ideal - is that the residents of Albert Square may have saved the BBC from Thatcher at the mid-80s peak of her power. Lacking popular shows, the BBC struggled to maintain the case for the universal licence fee. The huge audiences delivered by EastEnders probably got the Corporation sorted (as the Fowlers, Watts and Mitchells taught us to say) in the eyes of the Tories. Even so, this jamboree across the schedules feels as forced and self-glorifying as the celebrations of a dictator's birthday. Most shockingly, the series is co-hosted by Jeremy Spake, the camp Aeroflot official from the docusoap Airport, who the BBC is trying to turn into a presenter. Many had assumed that the embarrassment of the millennium eve show - when, on the day of Yeltsin's resignation, the BBC's reporter in Moscow was Spake talking about how cold it was - had ended this experiment. But here he is, live on-air for five days running from Albert Square, although he has absolutely no connection with EastEnders beyond watching it with 16.99 million others.

London Underground would continue day to day running of service, while private sector would ensure that track, signals and stations were modernised and upgraded, take the risk and meet the cost of any over-runs. Once the improvements are made, they would return to public control. Would use money raised from enforcement of bus lanes and red routes to provide under-18s with free bus passes. Regeneration Supports inward investment and an \"innovation partnership\" between government, London Development Agency and private sector to invest in businesses. Would develop partnerships between schools and businesses. Would set targets for reducing poverty as criteria for evaluating regeneration bids, aim to extend access to IT for all Londoners. Policing Would give all Londoners a named police officer. Foster intensive policing, work with communities and make better use of bylaws to take the heat out of crime hotspots. Appoint Trevor Phillips to oversee Metropolitan police authority. www.frank-dobson.org.uk Steve Norris, Conservative Transport Supports privatisation of the tube. Promises investment in infrastructure but no increase in fares above inflation. Would extend the Travelcard, insist on better information, ticketing and better night services, more use of technology to improve bus services and free up bus lanes. Would remove union \"stranglehold\" on London Transport, and support pressing ahead with new lines, extending the Docklands Light Railway and developing the Woolwich tunnel link.

Sobchak, who called himself a \"radical realist\" and said he was inspired by the speeches of Martin Luther King, was most renowned for his starring role in the perestroika drama under Mikhail Gorbachev at the end of the 80s, for his cool and courageous defiance of the old guard putschists in the summer of 1991, and for the early promise of his governance of Leningrad.</p> <p>A gifted public speaker in a political culture known for long-winded bores, Sobchak, handsome and nattily dressed, flourished in the democratic upheavals of 1989. He was particularly unusual in that he had never been a member of the communist party. He finally joined it in the dying days of the Soviet Union (he left it two years later accusing it of a failure \"to offer the country a real programme for moving to a new society\") and sat in the Congress of People's Deputies, the last Soviet parliament, elected in 1989.</p> <p>It was the high point of the Gorbachev era. The nation was glued to its television sets, absorbed in the raucous and thrilling debates that dominated congress. Sobchak became a star, a Gorbachev ally and one of the congress's most effective performers, his legal training helping him to cut through the weighty parliamentary procedure.</p> <p>A canny politician, he also became close to Boris Yeltsin, running the Russian presidential election campaign for Yeltsin in Leningrad in 1991 and delivering the vote. By then, he was the second most popular politician in Russia and a potential president.</p> <p>He instinctively rushed to Yeltsin's side in Moscow, in August 1991, supporting the Russian president in his finest hour against the communist putsch. Sobchak then risked arrest by going to Moscow airport, flying home to Leningrad and confidently confronting the regional military commander, who was poised to order the troops out into the streets in support of the coup.</p> <p>In Leningrad, the troops stayed in their barracks. Sobchak went on television that evening to denounce the plotters. The next day he appeared before a huge pro-democracy demonstration in the city, perhaps the biggest since the 1917 revolution, and was acclaimed as a hero.</p> <p>Sobchak was born at the height of Stalin's great terror in the Siberian railway town of Chita, near the Chinese border. His grandfather was an old Bolshevik who died after being incarcerated by Stalin. Sobchak was good at school and got a place to study law at the university of Leningrad, the city he would later make his home and power base. But he notably eschewed any communist party career.</p> <p>On graduation, he practised law in Stavropol, Gorbachev's home turf in southern Russia, before taking up a law teaching career in Leningrad in the 70s. An early sign of his radicalism was a pro-capitalist doctoral work submitted, and rejected, in 1973. He specialised in economic law, later writing several books on the subject. By 1981, he had been appointed Leningrad university's first professor of economics law.</p> <p>After starring in the congress in Moscow in 1989, Sobchak moved home to head the city council; in 1991 was elected mayor, following a month of paralysis in the Leningrad parliament. He held the post until 1996, when he narrowly lost his bid for a second term amid mudslinging and allegations of sleaze and nepotism. (Declaring his loyalty to Sobchak, Putin also left St Petersburg politics when his boss lost in 1996 and moved to Moscow, into the Kremlin administration of Boris Yeltsin.)</p> <p>In November 1997, Sobchak fled to France fearing arrest on corruption charges. He had been summoned to give evidence over a municipal scandal for allegedly arranging to have his flat upgraded and accepting another apartment as a gift for his niece. He returned home from France to practise law last summer after the corruption case was closed, a move credited to Putin who was then head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB.</p> <p>Since Putin succeeded Yeltsin on New Year's eve, Sobchak had been constant in his support for the new leader, stressing Putin's democratic convictions amid growing fears of the leader's authoritarian inclinations. Sobchak died in Kaliningrad while campaigning as Putin's envoy, seeking regional support for the presidential election on March 26.</p> <p>His autobiography, For a New Russia (1992), is an insider's account of the struggles within the fledgling democratic movement to break the power of the communist party.</p> <p>He leaves his wife and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Anatoly Sobchak, lawyer and politician, born August 10 1937; died February 20 2000</p>",

Sobchak then risked arrest by going to Moscow airport, flying home to Leningrad and confidently confronting the regional military commander, who was poised to order the troops out into the streets in support of the coup. In Leningrad, the troops stayed in their barracks. Sobchak went on television that evening to denounce the plotters. The next day he appeared before a huge pro-democracy demonstration in the city, perhaps the biggest since the 1917 revolution, and was acclaimed as a hero. Sobchak was born at the height of Stalin's great terror in the Siberian railway town of Chita, near the Chinese border. His grandfather was an old Bolshevik who died after being incarcerated by Stalin. Sobchak was good at school and got a place to study law at the university of Leningrad, the city he would later make his home and power base. But he notably eschewed any communist party career. On graduation, he practised law in Stavropol, Gorbachev's home turf in southern Russia, before taking up a law teaching career in Leningrad in the 70s. An early sign of his radicalism was a pro-capitalist doctoral work submitted, and rejected, in 1973. He specialised in economic law, later writing several books on the subject. By 1981, he had been appointed Leningrad university's first professor of economics law. After starring in the congress in Moscow in 1989, Sobchak moved home to head the city council; in 1991 was elected mayor, following a month of paralysis in the Leningrad parliament. He held the post until 1996, when he narrowly lost his bid for a second term amid mudslinging and allegations of sleaze and nepotism. (Declaring his loyalty to Sobchak, Putin also left St Petersburg politics when his boss lost in 1996 and moved to Moscow, into the Kremlin administration of Boris Yeltsin.) In November 1997, Sobchak fled to France fearing arrest on corruption charges. He had been summoned to give evidence over a municipal scandal for allegedly arranging to have his flat upgraded and accepting another apartment as a gift for his niece. He returned home from France to practise law last summer after the corruption case was closed, a move credited to Putin who was then head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB. Since Putin succeeded Yeltsin on New Year's eve, Sobchak had been constant in his support for the new leader, stressing Putin's democratic convictions amid growing fears of the leader's authoritarian inclinations. Sobchak died in Kaliningrad while campaigning as Putin's envoy, seeking regional support for the presidential election on March 26. His autobiography, For a New Russia (1992), is an insider's account of the struggles within the fledgling democratic movement to break the power of the communist party. He leaves his wife and two daughters. \u0095 Anatoly Sobchak, lawyer and politician, born August 10 1937; died February 20 2000",

      "bodyText": "Brazil boasts more plastic surgeons per capita than any other country in the world, according to the industry's trade association, and these past few weeks their scalpels have been working overtime. Aspiring young models are increasingly seeking last-minute plastic surgery fixes to secure the most sought-after positions in Rio de Janeiro's carnival parade next month. Hundreds of women, many in their early 20s, believe that having breast implants and liposuction in the weeks before the carnival is the only way to guarantee a place on the most prestigious, and prominent floats. As Rio's carnival is screened live on Brazilian television, it gives instant exposure, and sometimes celebrity, to the most beautiful women appearing in its spotlight. As such, the run up to the carnival sees the samba schools' social directors, who choose the women appearing on their floats, inundated with requests for positions. While competition among aspiring starlets has always been intense, young women are going to increasing lengths to \"improve\" their bodies because they see the event as the best way to launch a modelling career. In an extreme case, one model spoke of having a rib removed this week to reduce her waist two inches from 72cm (28in) to 66cm. \"The girls who are doing this are already very beautiful. But they want to be more beautiful,\" says plastic surgeon Edmar da Fontoura. \"They realise that carnival is a showcase for the world. It can start a career.\" Farid Hakme, whose Inter plastica clinic employs 53 plastic surgeons, says work doubles just before carnival. \"Normally, the first thing that the woman asks when she walks through the door is: 'Will it be ready for the parade?'\" Mr Hakme says. \"They come in for breast implants and usually take advantage of the operation to have liposculpture done around their buttocks. There has been a huge upsurge in the last two years.\" \"Large breasts never used to be fashionable in Brazil, but now they are the latest thing,\" he said. Most of the operations require as little as a two-week recovery period, so the clinics often remain fully booked until a fortnight before the pre-Lent carnival, which is taking place this year between March 4-7. And patients don't shy away from talking about which operations they have had, or who has done their work; the wife of Rio's state governor recently revealed that she had had li posuction for the festivities. Denise Braga, 26, who works as a body double for Brazilian soap opera's shower scenes, has had breast implants and a liposculpture. \"There are so many beautiful women that you need to have it done to catch the camera's attention,\" she says. Ms Braga has landed positions on four samba school floats during the parade's two main nights; once she has finished the parade with one school, she will have to run to ride with another. \"This shouldn't be too difficult - it's not as if I'll be wearing many clothes,\" she says. \"For one school, I'll just be wearing a cover of paint.\" It will be a long evening for Ms Braga, but she is more than willing to participate for a chance meeting with fame. However, not everyone likes the carnival's new, plastic direction. Monique Evans, who paraded for 10 years, said: \"It's not fun any more. There's too much of a fight.

      "body": "<p>Iranian voters have handed reformers a solid victory over their conservative rivals in nationwide elections for parliament, giving President Mohammed Khatami a major weapon through which to implement political and social reforms.</p> <p>With most votes counted yesterday, reform candidates had won in virtually all the main cities - some of which had been conservative strongholds. In the capital, Tehran, final results were yet to be posted but preliminary returns showed candidates from Mr Khatami's political faction poised for a big win.</p> <p>First place looked like going to the president's brother, Mohammed Reza Khatami. If so, he would be a strong contender for parliamentary speaker.</p> <p>The election, held on Friday, was seen as a referendum on Mr Khatami's programme for a government accountable to the people, a civil society based on the rule of law and a political system with true separation of powers.</p> <p>About 80% of the electorate voted. In Tehran, they queued for hours before polling stations opened.</p> <p>Results released yesterday showed reformers leading with approximately 104 of the 290 parliamentary seats so far, while about 43 seats went to conservative candidates and 37 to independents. At least 57 contests will require second-round run-offs.</p> <p>The political persuasions of the independent candidates, who could have a decisive impact on the reformists' strength in the new parliament, will not be known until parliament gets under way. Some ran as \"independents\" in order to disguise their political affiliations.</p> <p>In largely conservative Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, all five seats went to reformers from the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the Khatami ticket. The president himself was not up for election.

      "bodyText": "Iranian voters have handed reformers a solid victory over their conservative rivals in nationwide elections for parliament, giving President Mohammed Khatami a major weapon through which to implement political and social reforms. With most votes counted yesterday, reform candidates had won in virtually all the main cities - some of which had been conservative strongholds. In the capital, Tehran, final results were yet to be posted but preliminary returns showed candidates from Mr Khatami's political faction poised for a big win. First place looked like going to the president's brother, Mohammed Reza Khatami. If so, he would be a strong contender for parliamentary speaker. The election, held on Friday, was seen as a referendum on Mr Khatami's programme for a government accountable to the people, a civil society based on the rule of law and a political system with true separation of powers. About 80% of the electorate voted. In Tehran, they queued for hours before polling stations opened. Results released yesterday showed reformers leading with approximately 104 of the 290 parliamentary seats so far, while about 43 seats went to conservative candidates and 37 to independents. At least 57 contests will require second-round run-offs. The political persuasions of the independent candidates, who could have a decisive impact on the reformists' strength in the new parliament, will not be known until parliament gets under way. Some ran as \"independents\" in order to disguise their political affiliations. In largely conservative Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, all five seats went to reformers from the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the Khatami ticket. The president himself was not up for election. The group also won all five seats in Isfahan, Iran's most politically polarised city. Definitive results for Tehran will not be known for a few days, but reformers have captured at least the first five of the capital's 30 seats. The head of the leading conservative coalition, Mohammed Reza Bahonar, conceded defeat there. One reformer who appeared to have won easily was Alireza Nouri, brother of the jailed dissident cleric Abdullah Nouri. A conservative-dominated clerical court sentenced Abdullah Nouri, one of Iran's most popular politicians, to five years in prison in November primarily to keep him out of the election; at the weekend he was allowed home from prison for a few days. Jamileh Kadivar, a former adviser to President Khatami and the sister of a jailed reformist theologian, was also thought to have finished in the first five places for Tehran. The voters' message of change included a lukewarm vote for the former two-term president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was the conservatives' leading candidate for a Tehran seat. Preliminary results showed he could finish as low as 25th. His generation of leaders advocated economic liberalisation but resisted social reform. Results so far Preliminary results released by Iran's interior ministry Out of 290 seats: Reformers 104 Conservatives 43 Independents 37 At least 57contests require second-round run-offs",

Reuters, Vienna Jack Lang bids to run Paris France's former cultural minister, Jack Lang, has stated his intention to become the left's candidate for mayor of Paris in the election next year. His campaign got off to an unofficial start this weekend when he put his name forward for a party ballot next month. \"I am ready to take over Paris if the party is prepared to get behind an exhilarating project run by an enthusiastic team,\" he said.

For the moment these planes are very cheap and Britain and Europe can help the Ukraine and Russia [which supplies components] by giving them some business.\" </p> <p>Mr Bird said the two giant transporters, capable of carrying 120 tonnes of equipment or twice that of the Boeing C-17 on offer, would be acquired by the consortium, operated and crewed by British teams and released to the MoD for the 500 flying hours it requires. </p> <p>Each of them, he said, is capable of delivering a regiment of 40 Challenger II tanks, 100 tonnes of ammunition and 100 tonnes of spares to a battlefield such as Kosovo within five days days. </p> <p>The planes - and a further six available at commercial rates - would be deployed on civil freight charter work when not required by the MoD so the consortium could raise enough revenue to sustain the operation. </p> <p>The MoD is keen, after a series of problems in the Kosovo crisis, to deploy the transporters from next year until 2007 before a more permanent transporter, known as the future transport aircraft, is brought into service. </p> <p>The later competition puts Boeing, which is offering four C-17s in the short-term, up against a European Airbus consortium building a new A400M and Lockheed Martin's smaller C130-J. The MoD said it would decide its short-term and long-term solutions at the same time. </p> <p>Mr Bird admitted that the military favoured the C-17 but Boeing had been unable to meet the \u00a3500m budget ceiling - and, politically, the cabinet preferred the Airbus transporter, still on the drawing board, in the longer term. </p> <p>\"Ministers need time, within tight budgets, to clarify the problems and options but, in the short term, they have no time,\" he said. </p> <p>Ultimately, he added, the best solution for Europe's proposed common army would be to acquire both Antonovs and the smaller A400Ms.</p>",

For the moment these planes are very cheap and Britain and Europe can help the Ukraine and Russia [which supplies components] by giving them some business.\" Mr Bird said the two giant transporters, capable of carrying 120 tonnes of equipment or twice that of the Boeing C-17 on offer, would be acquired by the consortium, operated and crewed by British teams and released to the MoD for the 500 flying hours it requires. Each of them, he said, is capable of delivering a regiment of 40 Challenger II tanks, 100 tonnes of ammunition and 100 tonnes of spares to a battlefield such as Kosovo within five days days. The planes - and a further six available at commercial rates - would be deployed on civil freight charter work when not required by the MoD so the consortium could raise enough revenue to sustain the operation. The MoD is keen, after a series of problems in the Kosovo crisis, to deploy the transporters from next year until 2007 before a more permanent transporter, known as the future transport aircraft, is brought into service. The later competition puts Boeing, which is offering four C-17s in the short-term, up against a European Airbus consortium building a new A400M and Lockheed Martin's smaller C130-J. The MoD said it would decide its short-term and long-term solutions at the same time. Mr Bird admitted that the military favoured the C-17 but Boeing had been unable to meet the \u00a3500m budget ceiling - and, politically, the cabinet preferred the Airbus transporter, still on the drawing board, in the longer term. \"Ministers need time, within tight budgets, to clarify the problems and options but, in the short term, they have no time,\" he said. Ultimately, he added, the best solution for Europe's proposed common army would be to acquire both Antonovs and the smaller A400Ms.",

In 1965 Britain was a relatively high tax country, ranking seventh of the 24 OECD countries; in 1997 it ranked 14th. </p> <p>Britain was a high tax country throughout the 1960s because of the Butskell consensus. This may have been influenced by the belief that Gaitskell's promise not to increase taxes was one of the causes of Labour's defeat in 1959. Ironically it was John Smith's threat in 1992 to increase taxes, probably one cause of Labour's defeat then, that was responsible for the apparent consensus of the 1990s between the leaders of Conservative and Labour. </p> <p>Since Gordon Brown and William Hague are two of its main proponents and the consensus is based on an illusion, we should call it Bragueness. </p> <p>The illusion is that greater productivity, deregulation and privatisation will enable the government to increase expenditure to balance the budget and simultaneously to reduce the TTR. </p> <p>Bragueness is evidently part of the political struggle to capture the votes of the low-tax lobby, who when employed, have never had it so good. In the 1990s, whichever party was in power was attacked for breaking its promises not to raise taxes and replied that TTRs would decline and welfare targets would be met. </p> <p>There is a tacit consensus between government and opposition not to attribute unachieved welfare targets to Bragueness. It is never suggested that one reason why there is little poverty in Sweden or no hospital queues in France is that in 1997, the Swedish TTR was 51.9, the French 45.1. and the British 35.4; or more generally that the low UK TTR is not unconnected to the fact that government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is well below that of every other EU country save Ireland, Portugal and Spain. It is also rarely suggested that Britain's low TTR is likely to be partially responsible for its low position in the wealth indicators. </p> <p>There are valid arguments for adopting a low TTR approach as consistently preferred in Australia, Japan, Switzerland and the US, where the private sector takes on commitments adopted by the state in highly taxed north Europe. It is less easy to justify Bragueness that would pretend it is possible to sustain increased spending with a balanced budget and reduced TTR. </p> <p>Despite its increase in TTRs, the present government continues to use the Brague rhetoric that TTRs will soon be falling again as the safer way of winning the next election. </p> <p>Britain's strong economy renders such a strategy plausible. But it seems unlikely that the government will abandon the vagueness of Bragueness to point out with the aid of TTR statistics and welfare indicators that higher TTRs are a necessary condition of improved state provided welfare and infrastructure. </p> <p>Perhaps it might do so after the next election. </p> <p>\u0095 Ken Messere was head of the OECD fiscal affairs, 1971-91</p>",

Since Gordon Brown and William Hague are two of its main proponents and the consensus is based on an illusion, we should call it Bragueness. The illusion is that greater productivity, deregulation and privatisation will enable the government to increase expenditure to balance the budget and simultaneously to reduce the TTR. Bragueness is evidently part of the political struggle to capture the votes of the low-tax lobby, who when employed, have never had it so good. In the 1990s, whichever party was in power was attacked for breaking its promises not to raise taxes and replied that TTRs would decline and welfare targets would be met. There is a tacit consensus between government and opposition not to attribute unachieved welfare targets to Bragueness. It is never suggested that one reason why there is little poverty in Sweden or no hospital queues in France is that in 1997, the Swedish TTR was 51.9, the French 45.1. and the British 35.4; or more generally that the low UK TTR is not unconnected to the fact that government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is well below that of every other EU country save Ireland, Portugal and Spain. It is also rarely suggested that Britain's low TTR is likely to be partially responsible for its low position in the wealth indicators. There are valid arguments for adopting a low TTR approach as consistently preferred in Australia, Japan, Switzerland and the US, where the private sector takes on commitments adopted by the state in highly taxed north Europe. It is less easy to justify Bragueness that would pretend it is possible to sustain increased spending with a balanced budget and reduced TTR. Despite its increase in TTRs, the present government continues to use the Brague rhetoric that TTRs will soon be falling again as the safer way of winning the next election. Britain's strong economy renders such a strategy plausible. But it seems unlikely that the government will abandon the vagueness of Bragueness to point out with the aid of TTR statistics and welfare indicators that higher TTRs are a necessary condition of improved state provided welfare and infrastructure. Perhaps it might do so after the next election. \u0095 Ken Messere was head of the OECD fiscal affairs, 1971-91",

      "body": "<p>A woman will on average earn almost \u00a3250,000 less than a man during her lifetime, with women who have middle level qualifications paying a higher price than those who have none at all. </p> <p>Contrary to general belief, the prime cause of the gender income gap is not earnings lost by time off having children, an analysis published today concludes. </p> <p>Being a mother can add dramatically to the loss, the analysis shows, but the reasons for what is termed the \"female forfeit\" are women being concentrated in lower paid sectors of the job market, and discrimination in pay against those doing the same work as men - 25 years after the equal pay act. </p> <p>Occupations such as primary school teachers, nurses, care assistants, secretaries, cleaners and clerks, where 80% of the workforce is female, are affected. </p> <p>In a surprise finding that will alarm ministers seeking to encourage teenage girls to stay on at school, the study shows that a woman who leaves school with GCSEs will \"lose\" \u00a350,000 more over a lifetime than a woman with none. Women in clerical jobs lose more than shop assistants, though unskilled women lose significantly more than those with qualifications if the former have children. </p> <p>The research, conducted by the London School of Economics on behalf of the government's women's unit, will put pressure on the government to act.

Contrary to general belief, the prime cause of the gender income gap is not earnings lost by time off having children, an analysis published today concludes. Being a mother can add dramatically to the loss, the analysis shows, but the reasons for what is termed the \"female forfeit\" are women being concentrated in lower paid sectors of the job market, and discrimination in pay against those doing the same work as men - 25 years after the equal pay act. Occupations such as primary school teachers, nurses, care assistants, secretaries, cleaners and clerks, where 80% of the workforce is female, are affected. In a surprise finding that will alarm ministers seeking to encourage teenage girls to stay on at school, the study shows that a woman who leaves school with GCSEs will \"lose\" \u00a350,000 more over a lifetime than a woman with none. Women in clerical jobs lose more than shop assistants, though unskilled women lose significantly more than those with qualifications if the former have children. The research, conducted by the London School of Economics on behalf of the government's women's unit, will put pressure on the government to act. Ministers have stressed they will not legislate to enforce gender parity, but instead will urge employers to review pay structures.

      "body": "<p>Georgina Galanis lasted only nine days as PA to supermodel Naomi Campbell. During a stay in Canada, Galanis claimed, her celebrated boss lost her temper and hit her over the head with a mobile phone, shook her by the throat and punched her. It was the end of a promising working relationship. </p> <p>Working as a personal service PA (PSPA for short) is a labour of love. Secretarial skills are a requirement, but more important are flexibility and patience by the bucketful. Nine-to-fivers need not apply. </p> <p>It's not only celebrities who need an assistant-cum-secretary. \"Perhaps it's a single businessman whose home and company are in different parts of the country,\" says Mike Dark, partner of the British Employment Agency, which specialises in recruiting private service staff. \"Or a disabled person who needs someone to help them work from home.\" </p> <p>But the majority in this niche market are working in an environment far removed from the typical workplace. \"The employer can be anything from the royal family to pop stars. Lady-this and Countess-that. Majors, lords and chairmen of global conglomerates.\" Not for PSPAs the daily grind of office life, battling with the photocopier and taking endless calls from the supplier. Their challenges and frustrations can be as diverse as the moods of their employer. </p> <p>PSPAs usually live with their employer and are responsible for juggling both their business and private affairs. The clients of private service agency Serena Le Maistre &amp; Associates in London's Belgrave Street are usually wives of corporate chairmen. \"They have to organise everything on the social front - dinner parties or grouse-shooting weekends,\" says Le Maistre. \"Confidentiality and discretion are essential - and if the nanny is off sick, the PA does the school run too.\" </p> <p>So why do secretaries choose to ignore the corporate ladder for a job where walking the employer's beloved dogs is as important as opening the mail? Perplexed PA professionals need only look at the perks. Caroline Travis, PSPA to one of the country's 50 richest men, has a self-contained apartment, a car and all her expenses paid. Salaries are also much higher than the commercial sector. \"It's at least \u00a3300 a week, cash in hand. Without accommodation or expenses that's worth \u00a330,000 a year in London,\" she says. </p> <p>The job may be unusual, but snobbish stereotypes about personal secretaries apply. More than half of PSPAs are part of a couple where the husband is the gardener or butler and the wife is the secretary/housekeeper. Of the remainder, 30% are women, the majority in their 40s, either single or divorced. \"They are not going to move anywhere and have nowhere to go,\" says Dark, \"which is probably a callous way of putting it.\" </p> <p>Callous, but fair, concedes Travis, 50, who is divorced. \"I've always been an independent woman but you can't have a private life in the week because you could be called at any time.\" </p> <p>So why did Naomi Campbell admit this month to assaulting the very person employed to look after her? Whether her PA wasn't up to the job, or Campbell's rage was a celebrity tantrum too far, the root cause lies in the very nature of this peculiar job, says Marjorie Mair, head of secretarial and administrative development for the Industrial Society. \"Where do you draw the line when the personal is also the professional?\" she asks. </p> <p>The relationship between a PSPA and her employee is rarely like that of a boss and secretary in an office set-up, she says. For a start the majority of PSPAs do not work from a recognisable office. Employees are expected to improvise in the boss's home, drafting letters and taking telephone calls from the comfort of a silk-covered sofa where even a little coffee spill may be a major faux pas. You also have to be prepared to do anything your boss thinks is important, even if it's just collecting his dry-cleaning. </p> <p>Sara Ford, 35, is PA/housekeeper to an employer with a 14-bedroom mansion in a 22-acre forest on his estate in West Sussex. She says that on occasions she has to threaten to resign to get her employers to see how busy she is. \"Sometimes it's the only way to make them listen, especially if they have been away all week.\" </p> <p>Agencies such as the British Employment Agency claim to attract \"discerning employers and employees\", but although the PA's CV is checked thoroughly, the potential employer is never submitted to the same level of scrutiny. Dark recognises that this is far from ideal, but says the relationship between boss and PA is difficult to police. \"It all comes down to chemistry. Until the candidate sees the accommodation, the family and the property, it's hard to tell how it's going to work. And if you're not prepared to do what the employer wants, they'll just find somebody else who will.\" </p> <p>PSPAs are also in danger of missing out on basic employment rights. Travis was never given a formal contract by her boss and says that at her interview \"carrots were dangled that were never going to materialise\". </p> <p>\"I wasn't told my employer was estranged from his wife. He's just bought an estate in Germany and I was told there would be trips abroad to help the family. Instead I'm a very disillusioned kennel maid. </p> <p>\"At Christmas I was ordered to give up my New Year with less than a week's notice to look after their four dogs, who all have behavioural problems, while they went on holiday to the Caribbean. I started every day cleaning up the mess and spent New Year's Eve in tears. I was the only person on this 30-acre estate for most of the time and it got very isolating. </p> <p>\"I believe my employers brought me here under false pretences. They know they've got someone trust- worthy and reliable to look after the house but my main responsibility is dog-sitting. The PA side to the job never materialised.\" </p> <p>Agencies have little influence over errant employers if basic employment rights are not met. PSPAs are advised to draw up a contract setting out pay and conditions but Dark has no idea how often this is met. Travis has learnt this to her cost. \"At least in the commercial sector you have some kind of warning system to go through. I don't even know what a sackable offence is.\" </p> <p>It might seem astonishing that this experienced administrator, who has worked in catering and local government, would be prepared to tolerate such unhappy working conditions. Travis explains that, coming originally from the Channel islands, she had hoped to find a secure post in mainland Britain. \"I wanted to work in the UK in an environment where one has privacy and protection of an established family who need someone on call.\" </p> <p>Employers are not always honest, she says, about the facilities they are offering. \"They seem to think that because they are offering you a flat and the use of a car as part of the deal, you should feel really grateful to them. Then you find out your room is actually in an attic within the main body of the house, which is not so private and not such an incentive after all.\" </p> <p>Victoria Phillips, employment solicitor for trade union law firm Thompson's, says private service staff are entitled to nearly all the same rights as ordinary workers - a statement of terms and conditions of employment, pension scheme, sick pay, an itemised pay slip and recent EU directives such as the 48-hour week. However a private service employer can refuse a candidate on race or sex grounds without legal redress and tax and national insurance payments are often fudged. \"Without an itemised pay slip you don't know if you're working to a legal contract,\" she says. \"Go into private service and you're simply more vulnerable.\"</p>",

Whether her PA wasn't up to the job, or Campbell's rage was a celebrity tantrum too far, the root cause lies in the very nature of this peculiar job, says Marjorie Mair, head of secretarial and administrative development for the Industrial Society. \"Where do you draw the line when the personal is also the professional?\" she asks. The relationship between a PSPA and her employee is rarely like that of a boss and secretary in an office set-up, she says. For a start the majority of PSPAs do not work from a recognisable office. Employees are expected to improvise in the boss's home, drafting letters and taking telephone calls from the comfort of a silk-covered sofa where even a little coffee spill may be a major faux pas. You also have to be prepared to do anything your boss thinks is important, even if it's just collecting his dry-cleaning. Sara Ford, 35, is PA/housekeeper to an employer with a 14-bedroom mansion in a 22-acre forest on his estate in West Sussex. She says that on occasions she has to threaten to resign to get her employers to see how busy she is. \"Sometimes it's the only way to make them listen, especially if they have been away all week.\" Agencies such as the British Employment Agency claim to attract \"discerning employers and employees\", but although the PA's CV is checked thoroughly, the potential employer is never submitted to the same level of scrutiny. Dark recognises that this is far from ideal, but says the relationship between boss and PA is difficult to police. \"It all comes down to chemistry. Until the candidate sees the accommodation, the family and the property, it's hard to tell how it's going to work. And if you're not prepared to do what the employer wants, they'll just find somebody else who will.\" PSPAs are also in danger of missing out on basic employment rights. Travis was never given a formal contract by her boss and says that at her interview \"carrots were dangled that were never going to materialise\". \"I wasn't told my employer was estranged from his wife. He's just bought an estate in Germany and I was told there would be trips abroad to help the family. Instead I'm a very disillusioned kennel maid. \"At Christmas I was ordered to give up my New Year with less than a week's notice to look after their four dogs, who all have behavioural problems, while they went on holiday to the Caribbean. I started every day cleaning up the mess and spent New Year's Eve in tears. I was the only person on this 30-acre estate for most of the time and it got very isolating. \"I believe my employers brought me here under false pretences. They know they've got someone trust- worthy and reliable to look after the house but my main responsibility is dog-sitting. The PA side to the job never materialised.\" Agencies have little influence over errant employers if basic employment rights are not met. PSPAs are advised to draw up a contract setting out pay and conditions but Dark has no idea how often this is met. Travis has learnt this to her cost. \"At least in the commercial sector you have some kind of warning system to go through. I don't even know what a sackable offence is.\" It might seem astonishing that this experienced administrator, who has worked in catering and local government, would be prepared to tolerate such unhappy working conditions. Travis explains that, coming originally from the Channel islands, she had hoped to find a secure post in mainland Britain. \"I wanted to work in the UK in an environment where one has privacy and protection of an established family who need someone on call.\" Employers are not always honest, she says, about the facilities they are offering. \"They seem to think that because they are offering you a flat and the use of a car as part of the deal, you should feel really grateful to them. Then you find out your room is actually in an attic within the main body of the house, which is not so private and not such an incentive after all.\" Victoria Phillips, employment solicitor for trade union law firm Thompson's, says private service staff are entitled to nearly all the same rights as ordinary workers - a statement of terms and conditions of employment, pension scheme, sick pay, an itemised pay slip and recent EU directives such as the 48-hour week. However a private service employer can refuse a candidate on race or sex grounds without legal redress and tax and national insurance payments are often fudged. \"Without an itemised pay slip you don't know if you're working to a legal contract,\" she says. \"Go into private service and you're simply more vulnerable.\"",

      "body": "<p>Discovering at a job interview that your handwriting might be analysed is unconventional although not uncommon, but what if you were asked whether you'd mind under-going a test for possible \"substance abuse\"? It could happen, and it's perfectly legal. </p> <p>According to John Courtis, of recruitment specialists Courtis and Partners, screening potential employees for alcohol or illegal drugs is on the increase. \"Interview questions are designed to provoke greater disclosure, and 'Would you permit us to arrange a test for possible substance abuse?' is a killer question. After all, it might be crucial to the firm's security, and abuse could seriously affect your performance.\" </p> <p>Workplace drugs testing originated in America about 15 years ago. Whether you will be tested, usually by means of a urine sample, depends very much on the ethos of the company. In a typical workforce of 1,000 it's quite possible that 200 people are using illegal drugs, so it's perhaps not surprising that many companies will want to test candidates before employing them. </p> <p>For anyone who may have indulged in something a little naughty, there is no point in abstaining for a few days before a possible test. \"We can detect traces of some substances from over a week before the test,\" says Ian Dick, a corporate pathologist. Companies should always declare what they are testing for, he says, but they may merely tell you that you've failed.

      "bodyText": "Discovering at a job interview that your handwriting might be analysed is unconventional although not uncommon, but what if you were asked whether you'd mind under-going a test for possible \"substance abuse\"? It could happen, and it's perfectly legal. According to John Courtis, of recruitment specialists Courtis and Partners, screening potential employees for alcohol or illegal drugs is on the increase. \"Interview questions are designed to provoke greater disclosure, and 'Would you permit us to arrange a test for possible substance abuse?' is a killer question. After all, it might be crucial to the firm's security, and abuse could seriously affect your performance.\" Workplace drugs testing originated in America about 15 years ago. Whether you will be tested, usually by means of a urine sample, depends very much on the ethos of the company. In a typical workforce of 1,000 it's quite possible that 200 people are using illegal drugs, so it's perhaps not surprising that many companies will want to test candidates before employing them. For anyone who may have indulged in something a little naughty, there is no point in abstaining for a few days before a possible test. \"We can detect traces of some substances from over a week before the test,\" says Ian Dick, a corporate pathologist. Companies should always declare what they are testing for, he says, but they may merely tell you that you've failed. You're within your rights to have access to more detailed results, but it may take some time to see them. It might all sound like an invasion of privacy, if not an abuse of your civil rights, but there is a strong legal basis to such testing.

Elsewhere, the Duke's courtier Le Beau becomes a twitching, unctuous faggot; and Phoebe, just to provide some colour, is a lumpen hippie, rolling her own ciggies. The biggest groan is the Duke's wrestler, like something from a Dublinised version of Bouncers. </p> <p>As the Duke, Gerard McSorley gives an urgent, menacing performance, while as Touchstone, Pat Kinevane cuts a strange and vivid figure. </p> <p>Despite these gems, and the polish of the production, this is a good-humoured old snooze with no rhyme or reason to it. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p> <p> Until April 1.

Under Jonathan Miller's direction, the dappled glade is pared back to a big, white-cube set, with felled trees strewn across the stage. The costume is 20th century, from the pin-striped mafiosi of the Duke's courtiers, to the hunting gear and shepherd's rags of the woodland inhabitants. Miller aims for jocular punch and panache, with touches of lewdness. Thus Touchstone, philosophising to his fat shepherdess, grips his crotch a lot. Fair Rosalind (played with the usual twinkling warmth by Donna Dent) remains pure as driven snow, tinged with emotional sado-masochism in her cross-dressed deception of Orlando. Elsewhere, the Duke's courtier Le Beau becomes a twitching, unctuous faggot; and Phoebe, just to provide some colour, is a lumpen hippie, rolling her own ciggies. The biggest groan is the Duke's wrestler, like something from a Dublinised version of Bouncers. As the Duke, Gerard McSorley gives an urgent, menacing performance, while as Touchstone, Pat Kinevane cuts a strange and vivid figure. Despite these gems, and the polish of the production, this is a good-humoured old snooze with no rhyme or reason to it. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible Until April 1.
