It was the angled flight-deck on aircraft carriers, which saved many lives and millions of pounds.</p> <p>At that time Cambell was in an administrative backwater at the Ministry of Supply, as a naval air liaison officer. Previously, carriers had to launch and land aircraft with catapults and arrester wires, while other planes waited at the end of the only deck. The damage when an aircraft failed to take off or land properly, as often happened, and ploughed into waiting planes, was very high.

      "bodyText": "In 1951, Rear-Admiral Dennis Cambell, who has died aged 92, came up with one of those many British inventions that had to be taken up abroad before their value was appreciated at home. It was the angled flight-deck on aircraft carriers, which saved many lives and millions of pounds. At that time Cambell was in an administrative backwater at the Ministry of Supply, as a naval air liaison officer. Previously, carriers had to launch and land aircraft with catapults and arrester wires, while other planes waited at the end of the only deck. The damage when an aircraft failed to take off or land properly, as often happened, and ploughed into waiting planes, was very high. The Admiralty ignored him until US Navy officers showed keen interest in 1952. The first British experiments were made, with painted white lines, on the carrier HMS Triumph.

Peter Smith warned his members of the danger of them being left in the wings \"while the real drama of policy-making occurs somewhere else\". He spoke of his \"persistent concern that teacher organisations are busy writing themselves out of the script\". There was a need for all six teacher unions to find more effective ways of tapping the true feelings of all their members, rather than just the activists.

      "bodyText": "The best text for the opening day of the biggest teaching union's conference is the closing speech by the leader of the third biggest union on Thursday. Peter Smith warned his members of the danger of them being left in the wings \"while the real drama of policy-making occurs somewhere else\". He spoke of his \"persistent concern that teacher organisations are busy writing themselves out of the script\". There was a need for all six teacher unions to find more effective ways of tapping the true feelings of all their members, rather than just the activists. How was the profession going to attract the new blood that it needed if every Easter, in a succession of teacher conferences extensively covered by the media, all that emerged was a negative picture of whinge and protest?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> I had a nine-hour flight back from the US, on a packed 747. It wasn't bad; the food was almost edible, one of the 11 TV channels in my economy seatback showed the excellent Being John Malkovich, and I find that if you speak to the stewards firmly but politely, you can be awash with booze from an early stage. </p> <p>The problem was my fellow-passengers. I was behind the world's tallest Dad, who I knew would tip his seat back as far and as fast as it would go, which of course he did, almost spilling Bloody Mary, red wine and chicken in salsa on to my lap. </p> <p>He was accompanied by the world's tallest mum, a woman who spent much of the flight shouting at her children in an upper-class English rasp, waking me up at one point with the cry: \"Oh, do you want your fleece or your gilet, Daisy? And no you can't have Larry, please don't be so stupid!\" </p> <p>On my right was an American working a laptop so massive that, for him to use the mouse, it had to overhang the tray table by a foot or so. He was evidently using the time between Denver and Gatwick to design a baseball stadium. The temptation to lean an inch over and say: \"That looks an interesting key, mind if I press it?\" was great but resisted. </p> <p>The nice Scottish woman on my left could apparently only get to sleep by listening to very loud rock CDs on her Walkman. So she snoozed happily through the Chucka-choo-choo, chucka-choo-choo\" while I squirmed with repressed rage, especially when she actually woke up to put a new CD in. </p> <p>None of these people were thoughtless yobs. I'm sure that if I'd met any of them at a party I'd have liked them, with the exception of the shouting mum. </p> <p>They probably loathed me for the way I glowered at them, and left my reading light on throughout most of the night. </p> <p>My only consolation was that, the first time I crossed the Atlantic by myself, in 1973, the return air ticket cost six weeks' wages. Through shopping around early, my ticket to Denver cost less than two days' pay. </p> <p>\u0095 While I was waiting to speak in Colorado at one of the ferocious panels on Ireland which I mentioned last week, there was a short delay and I thought I'd fill in with one or two of the jokes I'd heard at a dinner the previous night. The dinner is hosted each year by Roger Ebert - probably the best-known American film critic these days - and traditionally ends with the telling at length of dirty jokes to the mixed company. </p> <p>As I launched into the only one I could possibly re-tell, I realised with horror that it was an Irish joke.

      "bodyText": "I had a nine-hour flight back from the US, on a packed 747. It wasn't bad; the food was almost edible, one of the 11 TV channels in my economy seatback showed the excellent Being John Malkovich, and I find that if you speak to the stewards firmly but politely, you can be awash with booze from an early stage. The problem was my fellow-passengers. I was behind the world's tallest Dad, who I knew would tip his seat back as far and as fast as it would go, which of course he did, almost spilling Bloody Mary, red wine and chicken in salsa on to my lap. He was accompanied by the world's tallest mum, a woman who spent much of the flight shouting at her children in an upper-class English rasp, waking me up at one point with the cry: \"Oh, do you want your fleece or your gilet, Daisy? And no you can't have Larry, please don't be so stupid!\" On my right was an American working a laptop so massive that, for him to use the mouse, it had to overhang the tray table by a foot or so. He was evidently using the time between Denver and Gatwick to design a baseball stadium. The temptation to lean an inch over and say: \"That looks an interesting key, mind if I press it?\" was great but resisted. The nice Scottish woman on my left could apparently only get to sleep by listening to very loud rock CDs on her Walkman. So she snoozed happily through the Chucka-choo-choo, chucka-choo-choo\" while I squirmed with repressed rage, especially when she actually woke up to put a new CD in. None of these people were thoughtless yobs. I'm sure that if I'd met any of them at a party I'd have liked them, with the exception of the shouting mum. They probably loathed me for the way I glowered at them, and left my reading light on throughout most of the night. My only consolation was that, the first time I crossed the Atlantic by myself, in 1973, the return air ticket cost six weeks' wages. Through shopping around early, my ticket to Denver cost less than two days' pay. \u0095 While I was waiting to speak in Colorado at one of the ferocious panels on Ireland which I mentioned last week, there was a short delay and I thought I'd fill in with one or two of the jokes I'd heard at a dinner the previous night. The dinner is hosted each year by Roger Ebert - probably the best-known American film critic these days - and traditionally ends with the telling at length of dirty jokes to the mixed company. As I launched into the only one I could possibly re-tell, I realised with horror that it was an Irish joke. So I rapidly flipped the nationalities round. A Frenchman, an Irishman and an Englishman are boasting about which country is the best to drink in. The Frenchman says he knows a cafe where if you buy a glass of wine, you get a second glass free. \"That's nothing,\" says the Irishman, \"I know a bar where if you buy a pint of Guinness, you get two pints free.\" \"My dear chaps.\" says the Englishman, \"I know a pub where you get your first drink free, your second free and your third drink free. Then you get laid.\" \"Zut!\" says the Frenchman. \"And 'ave you been to thees place?\" \"No,\" says the Englishman, \"but my sister has.\" Doesn't quite work, does it?

The winner must remain anonymous, to comply with strict US gaming regulations, despite being Robert Miller, economics editor of the Express. But, as the man from Blackfriars Bridge pocketed his 45 bucks, the Treasury's hit squad was paying out the winner of its own little wager, that on which word the newsmen would pick for their Brown bet.

Although I am embarking on my seventh decade of life, I am still in pretty good health and churning out stuff for the newspapers. If I happen to get ill and go to hospital, there should still be a sporting chance that I won't be designated \"not for resuscitation\" - a phrase which, according to Age Concern (an organisation with which I increasingly empathise), the National Health Service has been writing on the hospital notes of a number of elderly patients lately. </p> <p>But it is unfortunate that reports of such callousness in the NHS should have appeared in the media on the same day as reports that the government has written off pensioners as not worth cultivating politically because they tend to be Conservative and \"racist\". One begins to tremble slightly. The likelihood of being labelled \"not for resuscitation\" must surely increase if the government doesn't consider one to be of any value as electoral fodder. If we all promise to vote for New Labour at the next election, do you think we may be spared? </p> <p>According to the Sunday Times, New Labour's disillusionment with the old stems from the fact that they didn't play their part in the party's landslide victory of 1997. In fact, only 34% of pensioners voted Labour in that election, while 44% voted Tory. This was hardly an improvement on the 1992 election, when the equivalent figures were 36% Labour and 47% Tory. Pensioners either didn't notice, didn't care about, or didn't like the Labour Party's efforts to re-invent itself as a party dedicated to free-market principles. </p> <p>The view that pensioners are \"predominantly Conservative\" and \"often racist\" was attributed by the Sunday Times to Clive Soley, the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, though he has subsequently \"clarified\" the remark. Peter Mandelson has also denied saying at an election strategy meeting that there was \"no mileage\" to be had from pensioners, and that Labour instead should be targeting \"aspirational\" voters. But the impression remains that Labour considers pensioners a bit of a lost cause - people who whine about their pensions, blame the government for giving money to asylum seekers instead of them, and resolutely refuse to be grateful for all the help they are given. </p> <p>But how can 10 million people possibly be stereotyped in this way? Everybody has just one seamless life that cannot be split into segments. Most people are much the same at the end of their lives as they were at the beginning. Their characters may change with experience, but usually not much. Most idealists in youth remain idealists until they die. Most cynics remain cynics. If some people who used to vote Labour have stopped doing so in old age, this is as likely to be because the party has changed as because they have. </p> <p>When New Labour talks about \"aspirational\" voters, it doesn't mean people with higher aspirations for their country or for the good of the world, but people young enough to have higher aspirations for themselves - to become dot.com millionaires, for example. The old, in my experience, are no less concerned about the environment, genetically-modified foods, globalisation, education and other contemporary issues than the young are, and they are probably (though in this case for selfish reasons) much more concerned about health care. If Tony Blair cannot get them to vote for his party, it is probably because they don't think he is doing enough about these things. </p> <p>My mother-in-law, at 85, is no less a campaigner on the environment, and especially against nuclear power, than she ever was. Her elder sister is still campaigning against the export of live animals to Europe. My late mother was in her 90s before she stopped writing letters to General Pinochet asking him to stop killing and torturing people. </p> <p> Of course, some people become bitter in old age, usually because they resent being old. But others remain \"aspirational\" until they die. Obviously, the culture of youth is not very appealing to pensioners because it is specifically designed to exclude them. One wonders, for example, what older readers of the Daily Telegraph will have thought when they opened their paper this week to find an entire page devoted to a \"boob job\", a detailed personal account of a breast-implant operation. They must have felt that it was their paper, not they, that had changed. </p> <p>But it is also an error to stereotype the young by assuming that they all share the same values and are interested in the same things. There are, alas, plenty of racists among the young. There are also plenty of young people who reject trendiness. The 8,000 Christian evangelists who gave a rapturous reception to William Hague last Sunday when he spoke about family values at their \"Spring Harvest\" festival included few pensioners. Young, old, and middle-aged, we are all as varied as can be.</p>",

One wonders, for example, what older readers of the Daily Telegraph will have thought when they opened their paper this week to find an entire page devoted to a \"boob job\", a detailed personal account of a breast-implant operation. They must have felt that it was their paper, not they, that had changed. But it is also an error to stereotype the young by assuming that they all share the same values and are interested in the same things. There are, alas, plenty of racists among the young. There are also plenty of young people who reject trendiness. The 8,000 Christian evangelists who gave a rapturous reception to William Hague last Sunday when he spoke about family values at their \"Spring Harvest\" festival included few pensioners. Young, old, and middle-aged, we are all as varied as can be.",

Some 7.2 million tax returns have just been issued, mostly to the self-employed, company directors, higher paid employees, and others with untaxed income such as rents from property.

The first \u00a34,335 of her total income fell within her personal allowance, and the balance of \u00a31,136 should be taxed at 10%, giving a tax bill of \u00a3113.60. However, the building society will have deducted \u00a3400 tax from her interest (\u00a32,000 at 20%), and so she is entitled to a refund of \u00a3286.40. </p> <p>You can obtain a tax reclaim form (R40) from any tax office. It is fairly straightforward and should be sent to one of five reclaim offices listed in Revenue booklet IR 110 - A Guide For People With Savings. Refunds should be made within about four weeks, although things can take a bit longer at this time of year. </p> <p>For those who must file the full-blown tax return, my immediate advice is not to panic.

We normally send out a leaflet setting out the position under the Consumer Credit Act.\" A copy of the leaflet was produced, but it contained nothing that suggested people were entitled to claim for consequential loss. The spokesman said consideration would be given to altering it. Here, as in most battles between consumers and banks, it was determination that won the day. It is cheaper for a bank to pay the odd extra \u00a3100 to the customer who does not give up, than to evaluate each claim individually. However, for every person who takes a claim as far as this reader did, there may be a dozen who accept a bank's misleading statements about its legal liability at face value. One can't say whether Barclays has been guilty of anything worse than gross inefficiency, but customers' passivity undoubtedly contributes to the profits that enable the Matthew Barretts of this world the chance to award themselves \u00a330m. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

Two male strippers in one show is more than coincidence. Their styles, however, were very different. Phelim McDermott's solo for Ben Wright was a strip in reverse, beginning with a pair of pants and embroidering the act of dressing with a series of sweet- natured, if slight, comic routines. </p> <p>David Waring, in Gary Carter's fan dance, waggled his sequinned jock strap far more aggressively in our faces. As he artfully wielded a pair of ostrich plumes Waring ran the whole gamut of sexual tease - from coy Swan Princess to bump-and-grind male stripper. The timing was brilliant and the gestures so sharply observed that Waring's performance never toppled into indulgence. Its mordant eroticism was, however, familiar dance-theatre territory, unlike La Ribot's bizarre little number for Anna Williams. </p> <p>This opened on a stage littered with random objects and it transpired that Williams's task was to get all of them stuck on her flesh. Some were pre-glued, so that she had to press her exquisitely articulate limbs into contortions that allowed parts of her body to make contact with them. Bulkier objects she had to bind with sticky tape. The more encumbered Williams became, the harder her task and the more strangely she had to move. Given her skills as a dancer, it was a curiously beautiful process to watch - a wacky comment on the nature of virtuosity. </p> <p>Kate Gowar, another fine performer, was less flattered in Neil Greenberg's solo, which looked as if it wanted to launch into flights of dance but was embarrassed to do so. Ironically Gowar found a much better showcase in the group work, Russell Maliphant's Cut. Maliphant's style is inward and thoughtful, but it has a singing clarity of line that makes the dancers look like virtuosos even when they're performing simple moves (particularly in the burnished atmosphere of Michael Hull's lighting). But the tick-tock pulse of Matteo Fargion's music for Cut also inspires Maliphant to a series of tiny, complex interactions, so that the stage becomes a kind of sculpture garden - an intriguing showcase of sensuous lines, statuesque forms and grown-up clockwork toys. </p> <p>Spring Loaded continues until June 4.

As he artfully wielded a pair of ostrich plumes Waring ran the whole gamut of sexual tease - from coy Swan Princess to bump-and-grind male stripper. The timing was brilliant and the gestures so sharply observed that Waring's performance never toppled into indulgence. Its mordant eroticism was, however, familiar dance-theatre territory, unlike La Ribot's bizarre little number for Anna Williams. This opened on a stage littered with random objects and it transpired that Williams's task was to get all of them stuck on her flesh. Some were pre-glued, so that she had to press her exquisitely articulate limbs into contortions that allowed parts of her body to make contact with them. Bulkier objects she had to bind with sticky tape. The more encumbered Williams became, the harder her task and the more strangely she had to move. Given her skills as a dancer, it was a curiously beautiful process to watch - a wacky comment on the nature of virtuosity. Kate Gowar, another fine performer, was less flattered in Neil Greenberg's solo, which looked as if it wanted to launch into flights of dance but was embarrassed to do so. Ironically Gowar found a much better showcase in the group work, Russell Maliphant's Cut. Maliphant's style is inward and thoughtful, but it has a singing clarity of line that makes the dancers look like virtuosos even when they're performing simple moves (particularly in the burnished atmosphere of Michael Hull's lighting). But the tick-tock pulse of Matteo Fargion's music for Cut also inspires Maliphant to a series of tiny, complex interactions, so that the stage becomes a kind of sculpture garden - an intriguing showcase of sensuous lines, statuesque forms and grown-up clockwork toys. Spring Loaded continues until June 4. Details: 020-7387 0031. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

      "body": "<p>Financial consumers fail to shop around, have difficulty understanding the information they get, and often find it hard to identify products to match their needs, according to a new report from the Financial Services Authority published today. </p> <p>The watchdog found that three out of 10 failed to shop around - with the highest and lowest social classes the most likely to ignore this basic step in financial self-defence. Oddly enough, the retired are less likely to comparison shop than those in full-time employment. </p> <p>And independent advice does not rate highly either. A greater number are likely to look at products from companies where they were already customers, than the number of people who would consider going to an Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) or other companies put together. </p> <p>The research has worried the FSA and could have an effect on how companies present information to prospective customers. </p> <p>\"Many consumers do not know they have information needs,\" says Victoria Raffe, the FSA head of consumer policy and research. \"It is all too easy to make sweeping generalisations which assume a customer level of understanding that does not exist for most people buying financial services.\" </p> <p>After 12 years of financial services regulation, the FSA concludes that many potential customers do not know what products are available or appropriate for their needs; are overwhelmed with information and do not know which leaflets to read; are surprised or shocked by the small print when they find out what it means; and are unaware of how to access comparative information. </p> <p>As consumer advocates including Jobs &amp; Money have long argued, merely producing information which complies with regulatory requirements is of little help to customers with no legal, investment or actuarial knowledge - and that is most people. </p> <p>One solution, says the FSA, is to teach financial matters at school. Primary school materials will be sent out for September with secondary resources published a year after that. </p> <p>More immediately, the FSA plans to publicise its local call rate helpline (0845-606-1234) which has not yet been promoted. It currently attracts just 10,000 calls a month. There is also an e-mail facility at consumerhelp@fsa.gov.uk The FSA also publishes a number of consumer guides ranging from financial advice in general to how to make a complaint. The advice is mostly generic - the planned league tables which name individual companies have still to see the light of day. </p> <p>Meanwhile with world equity markets looking shakier than at any time since the Russian crisis two years ago, a new free web-based education service on shares was opened this week by the Lord Mayor of London.

      "bodyText": "Financial consumers fail to shop around, have difficulty understanding the information they get, and often find it hard to identify products to match their needs, according to a new report from the Financial Services Authority published today. The watchdog found that three out of 10 failed to shop around - with the highest and lowest social classes the most likely to ignore this basic step in financial self-defence. Oddly enough, the retired are less likely to comparison shop than those in full-time employment. And independent advice does not rate highly either. A greater number are likely to look at products from companies where they were already customers, than the number of people who would consider going to an Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) or other companies put together. The research has worried the FSA and could have an effect on how companies present information to prospective customers. \"Many consumers do not know they have information needs,\" says Victoria Raffe, the FSA head of consumer policy and research. \"It is all too easy to make sweeping generalisations which assume a customer level of understanding that does not exist for most people buying financial services.\" After 12 years of financial services regulation, the FSA concludes that many potential customers do not know what products are available or appropriate for their needs; are overwhelmed with information and do not know which leaflets to read; are surprised or shocked by the small print when they find out what it means; and are unaware of how to access comparative information. As consumer advocates including Jobs &amp; Money have long argued, merely producing information which complies with regulatory requirements is of little help to customers with no legal, investment or actuarial knowledge - and that is most people. One solution, says the FSA, is to teach financial matters at school. Primary school materials will be sent out for September with secondary resources published a year after that. More immediately, the FSA plans to publicise its local call rate helpline (0845-606-1234) which has not yet been promoted. It currently attracts just 10,000 calls a month. There is also an e-mail facility at consumerhelp@fsa.gov.uk The FSA also publishes a number of consumer guides ranging from financial advice in general to how to make a complaint. The advice is mostly generic - the planned league tables which name individual companies have still to see the light of day. Meanwhile with world equity markets looking shakier than at any time since the Russian crisis two years ago, a new free web-based education service on shares was opened this week by the Lord Mayor of London. Equity Education - www.equityeducation.com - is aimed at those who want to try to make some money, but don't want to take the risks of giving up their job and taking on the day trader task. But while there are risk and wealth warnings, do not expect to see alternatives to equities receiving a major billing. The course is backed by the City Corporation, the London Stock Exchange, Merrill Lynch, Halifax, which has a stockbroking arm, NatWest Stockbrokers and Share people.com. And most of these have a commercial interest in increasing private investor numbers. The no cost service aims to take beginners and more experienced investors through a course in the basics of stocks and shares, from what a share is through using a broker to managing a portfolio of shares. There will be three levels on the course - beginners, intermediate and advanced. Only the beginners course has so far been posted on the net - the intermediate work should come later this year with an advanced level early next year. Each step is backed up by an exam which you cannot take until you have perused the material in the section. The course consists of basic information - there is little on the dangers of taking big positions in volatile stocks.",

We get joke suitcases, shadow monsters, stand-up routines and funny merchants, all leading towards a frenzied Keystone Cops-style chase in which the permutated twins and their creditors are joined, for no apparent reason, by a knight in clanking armour and a lumbering dromedary. </p> <p>It's all very jolly but Parker underplays both the Syracusan twins' bewilderment at finding themselves in a dream-like Ephesus where they are constantly recognised, and the emotional dilemma of the luckless Luciana, wooed by the man she takes to be her brother-in-law. What you get instead is a considerable display of physical skill. David Tennant's Antipholus of Syracuse at one point does a slide down a staircase-rail and across the stage that Barrault might have envied.

He once turned up late for a one-day international, pleading a puncture but omitting to warn England in advance that he would be delayed. He has been temperamental, a highly strung talent whom many have wished to see highly strung. </p> <p>None of that remotely justifies his treatment.

The captain was one of three changes from the first leg, the others seeing Henry return after suspension and Fredrik Ljungberg preferred to Marc Overmars. </p> <p>Despite enjoying the bulk of possession in the first 20 minutes, Lens forced David Seaman into action only once when he dived to smother a low cross-cum-shot from Lamine Sakho. </p> <p>Arsenal's goalkeeper had watched in alarm only seconds earlier, though, when the Senegalese striker, helped by Ray Parlour's loss of balance, strode on to Charles-Edouard Coridon's astute pass down the middle. But Sakho hesitated, enabling Martin Keown to clear the danger. </p> <p>Henry's pace forced the game's first corner and the French striker produced his side's first shot after 21 minutes, when Parlour's persistence produced an opening on the right. But Henry's drive passed harmlessly wide of the far post. </p> <p>The French team's initial confidence and neatness started to drain away as Arsenal imposed themselves. Yet another Parlour run saw the lunging Henry again fail to connect before Arsenal fashioned the best movement of the opening period, one carving through the Lens' ranks. </p> <p>Silvinho found Henry with an intelligent pass down the left that was flicked instantly and cleverly into Dennis Bergkamp's path. The Dutchman strode through the middle and took aim but his deliberate 25-yard shot curled just wide of the far post. </p> <p>The goal that Arsenal had been threatening arrived two minutes before the interval. Ljungberg and Silvinho were involved in an exchange on the left side of the penalty area before the Brazilian supplied Henry, who turned away from his marker, cleverly dragging the ball as he did so, before unleashing a superb right-foot blast into the far corner. </p> <p>Arsenal came out after the interval to create, and miss, two glorious chances to make the tie safe. First Bergkamp, doggedly hunting down Franck Queudrue, forced the defender into error, the ball finding its way to Emmanuel Petit. Lens looked in vain for the offside flag but Petit was permitted to advance, only to deliberate about his shot and saw Jose Pierre-Fanfan clear. </p> <p>Three minutes later, an incisive ball from Petit found Henry in space down the left. The striker, like Bergkamp before, bore down on goal before carefully curling his shot. This time it rebounded from the far post and Parlour, following up, was thwarted by Guillaume Warmuz's desperate save. </p> <p> <strong> Lens </strong> (4-1-3-2): Warmuz; Sikora, Ismael, Pierre-Fanfan, Queudrue; Nyarko; Coridon, Dacourt, Brunel; Sakho, Nouma. </p> <p><strong> Arsenal</strong> (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Adams, Silvinho; Parlour, Vieira, Petit, Ljungberg; Bergkamp, Henry. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : J M Garcia-Aranda (Spain).</p>",

But Sakho hesitated, enabling Martin Keown to clear the danger. Henry's pace forced the game's first corner and the French striker produced his side's first shot after 21 minutes, when Parlour's persistence produced an opening on the right. But Henry's drive passed harmlessly wide of the far post. The French team's initial confidence and neatness started to drain away as Arsenal imposed themselves. Yet another Parlour run saw the lunging Henry again fail to connect before Arsenal fashioned the best movement of the opening period, one carving through the Lens' ranks. Silvinho found Henry with an intelligent pass down the left that was flicked instantly and cleverly into Dennis Bergkamp's path. The Dutchman strode through the middle and took aim but his deliberate 25-yard shot curled just wide of the far post. The goal that Arsenal had been threatening arrived two minutes before the interval. Ljungberg and Silvinho were involved in an exchange on the left side of the penalty area before the Brazilian supplied Henry, who turned away from his marker, cleverly dragging the ball as he did so, before unleashing a superb right-foot blast into the far corner. Arsenal came out after the interval to create, and miss, two glorious chances to make the tie safe. First Bergkamp, doggedly hunting down Franck Queudrue, forced the defender into error, the ball finding its way to Emmanuel Petit. Lens looked in vain for the offside flag but Petit was permitted to advance, only to deliberate about his shot and saw Jose Pierre-Fanfan clear. Three minutes later, an incisive ball from Petit found Henry in space down the left. The striker, like Bergkamp before, bore down on goal before carefully curling his shot. This time it rebounded from the far post and Parlour, following up, was thwarted by Guillaume Warmuz's desperate save. Lens (4-1-3-2): Warmuz; Sikora, Ismael, Pierre-Fanfan, Queudrue; Nyarko; Coridon, Dacourt, Brunel; Sakho, Nouma. Arsenal (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Adams, Silvinho; Parlour, Vieira, Petit, Ljungberg; Bergkamp, Henry. Referee : J M Garcia-Aranda (Spain).",

      "bodyText": "Angry scenes marred the match between Leeds United and Galatasaray last night, with a missile smashing a window of one of the coaches carrying Turkish executives and journalists to the return leg of a tie that had seen two English supporters killed before the first game in Istanbul. Police outriders failed to stop the ambush between the city centre and Elland Road, Leeds' stadium, as an object was thrown at the front coach. Coins were also thrown at the convoy as it turned into the stadium forecourt, where Galatasaray's team coach had arrived safely an hour earlier after a police decoy operation, before the Uefa Cup semi-final second leg. The tie, won by the Turkish side last night, has been overshadowed by the murders of two Leeds fans in Istanbul two weeks ago on the eve of the first leg, which the Premiership side lost 2-0. A police spokesman said a dozen arrests had been made, mainly for public order offences. The BBC said four of its journalists had been attacked by angry Leeds supporters. Chants from hundreds of fans of \"We are Leeds\" turned to \"Scum\", with a few men drawing fingers across their throats in a threatening gesture, allegedly after a Turk on one of the buses made an obscene gesture. The throat-cutting gesture was similar to that given by Turkish fans towards United supporters in Istanbul. The kick-off was delayed by 10 minutes as stewards and police searched every fan amid scuffles outside the ground. The Turkish players were applauded when they took bouquets of flowers and laid them round the pitch. Galatasaray joined Leeds in wearing black armbands but then there was a muddled attempt at a minute's silence - in reality 20 seconds punctuated by shouts and shushes - as players and officials stood still to remember the murdered fans. The centre of Leeds was very quiet as fans streamed the two miles to the club's ground, with mounted police stationed outside a number of pubs close to the main railway station but otherwise keeping a low profile.",

Hughes, Hutchison. <br>Substitutes: Ball, Jeffers, Jevons, Ward, Simonsen. <br></p> <p> <strong>Liverpool:</strong> Westerveld, Carragher, Henchoz, Hyypia, Matteo, Thompson, Hamann, Gerrard, Berger, Owen, Heskey.<br>Substitutes: Smicer, Fowler, Heggem, Murphy, Nielsen. <br></p> <p> <strong>Referee:</strong> G Poll (Tring) </p> <p> <strong>1 min</strong> Liverpool kick off at Goodison Park, historically a venue that has been a difficult place for the Reds to get a result. This Liverpool side has grown in confidence in recent months and will fancy their chances tonight.<br><strong>2</strong> David Thompson gets an elbow in the throat from Don Hutchison. Play continues and Thompson jogs down the touchline, rubbing his neck.<br><strong>5</strong> Heskey is the target for the ball over the top from the Liverpool midfield. For the third time in the first five minutes the long ball just reaches Gerrard in the Everton goal before the arrival of Emile.<br><strong>6</strong> Thompson is the first player to be <strong>booked</strong> as an over-enthusiastic tackle on Barmby leaves the Everton man poleaxed.<br><strong>8</strong> Mark Hughes feeds a great ball through the middle for Barmby to latch on to. His left-foot shot across the goal lacks pace and Westerveld makes the save with ease.<br><strong>10</strong> Mark Hughes penalised for backing into Henchoz. How many more times will that happen tonight?<br><strong>12</strong> Berger pounces on a loose clearance from Gerrard and plays in a delightful through-ball for Owen. The Liverpool striker advances on the Everton keeper, but Gerrard does everything right and makes the save to his right. Owen will rue not hitting it with his left foot, opting to scuff it in with his right.<br><strong>13</strong> Mark Hughes breaks upfield for the Toffees and tries his luck from 25 yards on the right. his effort is weak and straight at Westerveld.<br><strong>15</strong> Mark Hughes, with his back to goal (surprise) lays the ball back to his namesake Stephen. The former Arsenal man's rising shot is never going to trouble the Liverpool keeper, and sails harmlessly out of play. Goal kick. Early encouragement for Hughes and Everton.<br><strong>18</strong> Everton playing all of their creative attacking play through Mark Hughes. The Welsh firebrand feeds Stephen Hughes on the left. His snap shot skids across the face of the goal, and Unsworth cannot keep it in play.<br><strong>21</strong> A corner to Everton, from the left, taken deep to Mark Hughes at the far post. His scissor-kick/volley is ambitious even by his standards, and the ball balloons off his left foot for a goal kick.<br><strong>24</strong> Again, Gerrard has to sprint of his line as another slide-rule through-ball from Berger for Heskey to chase bisects the Everton defence. One of these is going to get through tonight.<br><strong>26</strong> It's all a bit scrappy as the soggy conditions underfoot make it difficult to set off on any long, mazy runs. Both sides swap possession in midfield four, five times and eventually it trickles out for a throw. The match needs some quality.<br><strong>30</strong> Chaos and mayhem in the Everton area as Heskey feeds a diagonal ball to Thompson on the right, who in turn feeds a first-time cross met by Owen at the far post. His shot is directed downwards and the bounce fools Gerrard, who spills the save. Heskey seems to hesitate as the ball falls to him, and Dunne has just enough time to clear. A great chance and Heskey will be kicking himself.<br><strong>35</strong> Liverpool continue to press during their best spell of the match so far. Berger is getting more of the ball, and that is reflecting in the increase the overall quality and imagination of the Liverpool attack.<br><strong>39</strong> Heskey injured as he challenges for an aerial ball. He lands awkwardly, twisting his back on impact, and is receiving lengthy treatment from the Liverpool physio.<br><strong>40</strong> Heskey back on the pitch, smiling away. Good news for Liverpool and England.<br><strong>43</strong> David Unsworth clatters into Thompson. X-rated Merseyside derby stuff - the pace of the game hasn't wavered during this frantic first half.<br><strong>44</strong> Hamann raises his boot into John Collins' face and is <strong>booked</strong>.<br><strong>45</strong> Heskey, on defensive duty, challenges Xavier on a cross at Westerveld's left-hand post. He immediately indicates to the Liverpool bench that his back is still bothering him, and again the physio works his magic. Anxious moments for Gerard Houllier.<br><strong>47</strong> Liverpool have a free kick on the left, 40 yards from goal. The cross is poorly directed and Everton can clear.<br><strong>48</strong> A high-octane half comes to an end. Hopefully there will be more quality on display in the second half.<br></p> <p><strong>45 Liverpool substitution:</strong> Robbie Fowler for Emile Heskey. A great striker joins the match.<br><strong>47</strong> Berger almost latches on to an excellent lofted through-ball from Hamann, but for once his first touch is poor and Gerrard can collect.<br><strong>48</strong> Gerard denied by Gerrard on the left. A good shooting chance from 15 yards and the Everton keeper does well to parry the effort away. Liverpool have started really brightly, buoyed by Fowler's return.<br><strong>50</strong> Nicky Barmby drives a low shot from the left to Westerveld's near post, after Mark Hughes' tenacity pays dividends on the left touchline. The Dutch keeper saves well - Everton's first chance of the half.<br><strong>53</strong> Michael Owen beats two Everton defenders with pace and change of direction on the left. His low, skidding shot beats Gerrard, but shaves the outside of the upright.<br><strong>56 Liverpool substitution:</strong> Heggem for Thompson.<br><strong>57</strong> Mark Hughes, looking suspiciously offside, is deemed to be onside and breaks through the middle. Gerrard narrows the angle but Hughes' shot from the right slides across the Liverpool goal. Their best chance of the night goes begging and the veteran Welshman knows he should have done better.<br><strong>59</strong> Henchoz saves Liverpool's bacon with an athletic clearance just as Mark Hughes' lofted pass looked to be landing at Hutchison's feet with only Westerveld to beat.<br><strong>62</strong> The challenges are flying in thick and fast. Matteo on Collins, then Gerard on Xavier. The ref keeps his cards close to his chest.<br><strong>64</strong> Pembridge snatches at a chance on the right from 20 yards and misses the target. This is after Mark Hughes demolishes Dominic Matteo for a 50-50 ball. Matteo, somewhat understandably, is slow to rise to his feet.<br><strong>66</strong> John Collins makes space for a shot from the left, from 25 yards out. The rising drive is a powerful one, but straight at the Liverpool keeper.<br><strong>68</strong> It seems impossible, but the action seems to have gone up a gear. This frantic match is only pausing for fouls.<br><strong>70</strong> A cross from the right is cleared for an Everton corner. The centre is aimed at the near post, and is cleared easily. Another corner results, and another poor delivery follows. Set pieces may be Everton's best chance of taking anything from this game, and they cannot afford to waste them like this.<br><strong>72</strong> Pembridge almost manages to squeeze his shot between Westerveld and his near post, but his effort smacks into the side netting on the right.<br><strong>75</strong> A free kick to Liverpool in a central position, 25 yards out. Fowler takes it quickly, but his shot cannons off the wall and into the arms of Gerrard. Meanwhile, Francis Jeffers starts to peel off layers of tracksuit...<br><strong>80</strong> Hamann almost finds Owen with a low cross-shot from the right that eludes everyone in the Everton box. Looks like one goal will decide this.<br><strong>81</strong> Another corner to Everton, from a deflected shot off Steven Gerard. A melee ensues and Weir drives his shot straight into Hutchison. The ricochet falls to Westerveld with Mark Hughes in close attendance. It turns out to be his last contribution, because...<br><strong>82 Everton substitution:</strong> Jeffers for Mark Hughes.<br><strong>83</strong> Patrik Berger screams a rising drive at Gerrard from 20 yards centre-right. The Everton keeper can only parry to shot, and Gerard cannot control the follow-up shot, which balloons out for a goal kick.<br><strong>84</strong> Jeffers his welcomed to the game by Henchoz, with a sliding tackle worth a <strong>booking</strong>, according to referee Poll.<br><strong>85 Everton substitution:</strong> Ball for Pembridge.<br><strong>88</strong> Berger breaks a tackle on the right of the Everton area. His pull-back is for Heggem, who can only scuff the ball into Gerrard's hands. A great chance made a little trickier than it should have been as the ball from Berger was played slightly behind his teammate.<br><strong>90 Everton substitution:</strong> Ward for Barmby.<br><strong>91</strong> Two minutes of added time for a winner to appear.<br><strong>92</strong> Farce at the end of the match as Westerveld takes a free kick just outside his own area and drives the ball straight into Don Hutchison's back. The ball rolls into the net and Everton players start to celebrate, but the referee does not allow the goal to stand, presumably because Hutchison wasn't 10 yards away. Referee Poll then draws the game to a close to a cacophony of whistles and jeers. The upshot of all this is that Manchester United will retain the Premiership title if they win tomorrow.<br></p>",

And in doing so, has given us the first big star of the new decade: Christian Bale, an actor who gives a smart and sensuously physical performance.</p> <p>He is Patrick Bateman, a smirking, self-important young man working for a Wall Street merchant bank in the 1980s. Grotesquely overpaid, he lounges in his hi-tech, spotlessly clean bachelor pad; he broods over the latest restaurants, the hippest clubs; he works out; he is casually, heartlessly unfaithful to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), his \"supposed fianc\u00e9e\".</p> <p>At the office, he competes ruthlessly with the other Ivy League fellows, and never seems to have to do any work - which is, incidentally, the one period error Harron commits: no financial institution, certainly no American institution of that time would let an employee get away with skiving in their office, listening to a chunky Sony Walkman. But there is something else about Bateman. He has a taste for slashingly, murdering violence - and the odd acte gratuit against tramps escalates into a raging secret addiction to killing, mainly women and prostitutes he lures to his apartment. Or is it all happening in his head?</p> <p>Fans of the novel routinely claim the stomach-turning violence that once made it so controversial is a brilliant metaphor for the 1980s culture of consumerism and self-gratification. I am agnostic about these claims to moral seriousness, and that violence/materialism link has always looked a bit specious and glib.</p> <p>But, either way, violence raises a distinctively generic problem in a commercial movie that it doesn't in a literary novel, and Harron adroitly solves this problem or, at any rate, bypasses it, by having most of the slicing and dicing happen off-camera. So it is saved from looking like a slasher movie with pretensions, or a sub-Joe Eszterhas chiller.</p> <p>Harron and Guinevere Turner's adaptation is very funny when Bateman and his buddies compete for who has the most stylish business card, or when Bateman calls the smartest restaurant in Manhattan, asks them for a table for two at 8.30 that evening and is rewarded by the maitre d' simply laughing uncontrollably until Bateman is forced, disconsolately, to hang up.</p> <p>When Bateman and one of his pseudo-friends have crowded into a night spot lavatory stall, and started arguing about something, someone pops their head over the top of the one next door and says: \"Hey, will you keep the noise down, I'm trying to do drugs in here!\" All the strange banality and gentility of upscale partying habits are summed up in the line.</p> <p>Ellis's set-piece ruminations about 1980s recording giants Phil Collins, Genesis and Huey Lewis and the News are put into Bateman's mouth as supercilious speeches to the wary, resentful women who have entered his lair. These arias of drollness, juxtaposed as they are with the promise of imminent horror, are very funny, and it is at these moments you realise the script has a higher IQ than almost anything else around. But they are also replete with the inverted-commas, post-modern irony that was actually the last word in intellectual modishness in the 90s - and is now itself a bit dated.</p> <p>Despite the notional 80s setting, Ronald Reagan on TV etc, everything looks and feels more or less contemporary, particularly the burnished chrome of Bateman's spiffy apartment. This is a digitally remastered, remixed 1980s, suitable for \u00fcber-cool satire, without any of the low-comic tackiness or bad haircuts of, say, The Wedding Singer.</p> <p>Bale is really excellent, and it is odd to think how close Leonardo DiCaprio came to being monumentally miscast in the part. Especially at the top of the film, performing his morning facial defoliation scrub routine, Bale is a massively threatening, preening, narcissistic figure, all abs and pecs. His large, impassive face attains the almost creepy handsomeness of a young Schwarzenegger. (It would be interesting to see Bale in a leading Shakespearian role of martial aggression - is anyone making Coriolanus?)</p> <p>Harron defers the moments of horrid revelation until the end, and this restraint pays off as she lets rip with some really nasty Tobe Hooper unpleasantness, and then, with Bateman's final, hideous voice-over about his mission simply to perpetuate and spread pain for all eternity, a little of Abel Ferrara.

As a pictorial logo, it is in the same league as Nike's seminal swoosh, but unlike the swoosh, the bunny has a distinctly retro flavour, firmly lodged in the 60s and 70s heyday of Hugh Hefner's empire. Nonetheless, this is one bunny that is about to come bouncing back. </p> <p>Eagle-eyed couch potatoes may have noticed Carrie Bradshaw, aka Sarah Jessica Parker, wearing a Playboy bunny pendant in the massively successful Sex In The City series. Which might not sound like very strong evidence, but bear in mind that the fashion-forward, urban-glamour Carrie Bradshaw \"look\" has whipped America's style press into a frenzy not seen since Jennifer Aniston spawned a million \"Rachel\" haircuts. </p> <p>On this side of the Atlantic, Stella McCartney got into trouble when she included a sharp-toothed, skeletal version of the bunny in her spring/ summer 2000 collection for Chloe. (The designs were withdrawn when Playboy got wind of them, though Helen Isaacson, president of product marketing for Playboy Inc. in New York, told American Vogue: \"No one is defining what is trendy, unique, or desirable for young people more than Stella McCartney. What she represents in the fashion world is exactly where we're going.\") Meanwhile Gail Porter, best known as the bottom that lit up the Houses of Parliament, sported a bunny necklace on Top of the Pops and Pippa Brooks, the terrifyingly hip co-owner of fashion emporium Shop in London's Soho, wore a 70s gold Playboy bunny necklace when she was photographed for Jane, America's wittiest and most stylish women's magazine. </p> <p>It was Brooks' soft spot for the bunny that caught Isaacson's attention and last year Playboy approached Brooks and her Shop partner Max Carie with a proposal to licence the bunny motif to their Shopgirl label. The result is a Playboy range within Shopgirl, including jewellery and bunny logo underwear, which will be launched at the Playboy building in New York in June and go on sale later in the summer. </p> <p>There's no doubt the Playboy bunny has hopped back into fashion focus first and foremost because it fits with current trends (rule one: never underestimate the shallowness of the fashion world). Logos are this season's biggest story and the bunny is undeniably cuter than most monograms, after all. And on catwalks from Paris to New York, the message was: sex sells. Alongside skintight jeans and rhinestones, hotpants and lipgloss, the bunny fits right in. \"It's quite Fiorucci,\" Carie muses. \"Cute and sophisticated at the same time.\" </p> <p>Cute it might be, but the question remains: why would a girl as cool as Brooks want to be associated with Playboy? Isn't the bunny a symbol of degrading, unequal gender relationships, better left to gather dust with the cottontails? The writer Joan Smith, who has interviewed former bunnies, sees the bunny as representing \"a middle-aged man's sex fantasy, and not a very interesting one at that\". </p> <p>But somehow the Playboy image seems harmless in this day and age. Now that every other music video features gyrating G-stringed bottoms, the days when girls in full-cut pants and sturdy black tights were considered the height of erotic decadence seem almost charmingly naive. </p> <p>Playboy bunnies look about as rude as Victorian ladies lifting their petticoats to show a glimpse of ankle. And it is even harder to see 74-year-old Hugh Hefner, looking increasingly infantile with his pyjamas and kid-in-a-sweetie-shop grin, surrounded by \"special friends\" Sandy, Mandy and Brande, as anything other than laughable. Even the renaissance of the Playboy Mansion as fantasy sex-Disneyland seems curiously harmless, with stories of security guards on hand to make sure no one gets drunk or takes drugs, and Hef's much-trumpeted new best friend being baby-faced prepubescent favourite Leonardo diCaprio. </p> <p>\"Women feel they are switching things round, wearing the bunny logo,\" Carie says. Playboy is a magazine for men: \"But men can't wear the logo, only women can. Women are saying, I'm choosing to wear this.\" </p> <p>To Smith, this is a phoney liberation. \"It's like saying it's time we reclaimed footbinding. Certain things were tacky when they happened and they're still tacky. One can laugh at Hefner now, but there is still something vampiric about an old man's lust for young female flesh.\" </p> <p>Smith believes the adoption of the bunny by a new generation of women shows how little has changed since the Playboy heyday. \"It's still hard for women to find an authentic way to express themselves sexually; they are still searching for a way to be sexual. These organisations [like Playboy] enable women to express that in a way that's safe and socially acceptable. But it's sad women don't have the confidence to be sexual in another way.\" </p> <p>Brooks sees it differently. \"It's a gut thing with girls: as soon as they see the bunny T-shirts, they love them. Japanese girls especially are obsessed with the Playboy bunny in the same way they're obsessed with Hello Kitty. Girls have taken it over and it's become cute. Most have probably forgotten it comes from a porno magazine.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "This bunny is more famous than the Easter bunny. The Playboy rabbit head is one of the most recognisable images of our time, instantly resonant of martini glasses and silk pyjamas, jacuzzis and curves. Vladimir Nabokov, a respected butterfly enthusiast in his spare time, was once moved to write to Hugh Hefner to point out how the carefully positioned wings and eyespot of a butterfly can be made to look like the Playboy bunny motif. As a pictorial logo, it is in the same league as Nike's seminal swoosh, but unlike the swoosh, the bunny has a distinctly retro flavour, firmly lodged in the 60s and 70s heyday of Hugh Hefner's empire. Nonetheless, this is one bunny that is about to come bouncing back. Eagle-eyed couch potatoes may have noticed Carrie Bradshaw, aka Sarah Jessica Parker, wearing a Playboy bunny pendant in the massively successful Sex In The City series. Which might not sound like very strong evidence, but bear in mind that the fashion-forward, urban-glamour Carrie Bradshaw \"look\" has whipped America's style press into a frenzy not seen since Jennifer Aniston spawned a million \"Rachel\" haircuts. On this side of the Atlantic, Stella McCartney got into trouble when she included a sharp-toothed, skeletal version of the bunny in her spring/ summer 2000 collection for Chloe. (The designs were withdrawn when Playboy got wind of them, though Helen Isaacson, president of product marketing for Playboy Inc. in New York, told American Vogue: \"No one is defining what is trendy, unique, or desirable for young people more than Stella McCartney. What she represents in the fashion world is exactly where we're going.\") Meanwhile Gail Porter, best known as the bottom that lit up the Houses of Parliament, sported a bunny necklace on Top of the Pops and Pippa Brooks, the terrifyingly hip co-owner of fashion emporium Shop in London's Soho, wore a 70s gold Playboy bunny necklace when she was photographed for Jane, America's wittiest and most stylish women's magazine. It was Brooks' soft spot for the bunny that caught Isaacson's attention and last year Playboy approached Brooks and her Shop partner Max Carie with a proposal to licence the bunny motif to their Shopgirl label. The result is a Playboy range within Shopgirl, including jewellery and bunny logo underwear, which will be launched at the Playboy building in New York in June and go on sale later in the summer. There's no doubt the Playboy bunny has hopped back into fashion focus first and foremost because it fits with current trends (rule one: never underestimate the shallowness of the fashion world). Logos are this season's biggest story and the bunny is undeniably cuter than most monograms, after all. And on catwalks from Paris to New York, the message was: sex sells. Alongside skintight jeans and rhinestones, hotpants and lipgloss, the bunny fits right in. \"It's quite Fiorucci,\" Carie muses. \"Cute and sophisticated at the same time.\" Cute it might be, but the question remains: why would a girl as cool as Brooks want to be associated with Playboy? Isn't the bunny a symbol of degrading, unequal gender relationships, better left to gather dust with the cottontails? The writer Joan Smith, who has interviewed former bunnies, sees the bunny as representing \"a middle-aged man's sex fantasy, and not a very interesting one at that\". But somehow the Playboy image seems harmless in this day and age. Now that every other music video features gyrating G-stringed bottoms, the days when girls in full-cut pants and sturdy black tights were considered the height of erotic decadence seem almost charmingly naive. Playboy bunnies look about as rude as Victorian ladies lifting their petticoats to show a glimpse of ankle. And it is even harder to see 74-year-old Hugh Hefner, looking increasingly infantile with his pyjamas and kid-in-a-sweetie-shop grin, surrounded by \"special friends\" Sandy, Mandy and Brande, as anything other than laughable. Even the renaissance of the Playboy Mansion as fantasy sex-Disneyland seems curiously harmless, with stories of security guards on hand to make sure no one gets drunk or takes drugs, and Hef's much-trumpeted new best friend being baby-faced prepubescent favourite Leonardo diCaprio. \"Women feel they are switching things round, wearing the bunny logo,\" Carie says. Playboy is a magazine for men: \"But men can't wear the logo, only women can. Women are saying, I'm choosing to wear this.\" To Smith, this is a phoney liberation. \"It's like saying it's time we reclaimed footbinding. Certain things were tacky when they happened and they're still tacky. One can laugh at Hefner now, but there is still something vampiric about an old man's lust for young female flesh.\" Smith believes the adoption of the bunny by a new generation of women shows how little has changed since the Playboy heyday. \"It's still hard for women to find an authentic way to express themselves sexually; they are still searching for a way to be sexual. These organisations [like Playboy] enable women to express that in a way that's safe and socially acceptable. But it's sad women don't have the confidence to be sexual in another way.\" Brooks sees it differently. \"It's a gut thing with girls: as soon as they see the bunny T-shirts, they love them. Japanese girls especially are obsessed with the Playboy bunny in the same way they're obsessed with Hello Kitty. Girls have taken it over and it's become cute. Most have probably forgotten it comes from a porno magazine.\"",

Instead of having \u00a311bn left in the kitty at the end of the financial year, as he predicted in last month's budget, he has a bumper \u00a315bn. If it were anyone but Gordon, the question would be how quickly can he spend it. </p> <p>However, we are in safe hands with Mr Brown. Having already pledged to use his \u00a320bn windfall from the auction of new generation mobile phone licenses for paying down debt, Mr Brown is likely to be similarly hair-shirted about locking his latest bonus. </p> <p>Above all the Treasury fears repeating the mistakes made by the previous government in the late 80s when it mistook a temporary surplus in the government's finances as a result of an unheathily booming economy, for a structural shift out of deficit. This time, however, most commentators agree that improvement in the fiscal position is real. </p> <p>Mr Brown's team faces a dilemma. At this stage in the economic cycle, the chancellor cannot spend either the mobile phone windfall or run down his structural surplus without provoking the Bank of England into offsetting the boost to demand with higher borrowing costs. </p> <p>But the sight of the Treasury revelling in loads of money does not fit well alongside the shabby state of Britain's public services. After decades of underinvestment - in everything from roads to public transport to schools and hospitals - even increases likely to be unveiled in this summer's second comprehensive spending review will not repair the tattered fabric of the public sector. </p> <p>The one-off bonus of the mobile phone windfall should not be squandered on tax cuts or spending at the expense of higher interest rates. What is needed is some creative thinking about long-term investment ideas which will not immediately flood the economy with cash and force the Bank to retaliate with higher borrowing costs. </p> <p>The \u00a320bn is a serious amount of money. How to spend it deserves some serious consideration. </p> <p><strong> Top dogs </strong></p> <p>The latest set of figures by Caps, the fund performance measuring firm, are an intriguing read. For one thing, name and brand awareness, the speak of the market executives counts for little. </p> <p>Fuji-Lord Abbett and Orbitex are not household names, but they vie for the top two slots with a return of close to 15% return during the first three months of the year. Languishing at the other end of the much-watched league table are better known firms such as Abbey Life, Britannic, Standard Life and more tellingly Phillips &amp; Drew and Prudential, all of which produced negative returns for their investors. </p> <p>True, it was a difficult period for many of the so-called \"pooled mixed with property funds\" with the median return for the sector at minus 0.4%, the slowest start to an investment year since 1994. </p> <p>To be fair, this is better than the minus 3.4% return of the FTSE All Share index - often used as a benchmark by the major pension fund trustees - during the three month period. But it might be a source of alarm for the trustees, who make the crucial decision about which of the fund management firms should be entrusted with their precious assets, before the recent stock market rout which occurred outside the period of this latest table. </p> <p>The list makes slightly better reading for the giant Mercury Asset Management, which is creeping back up the honours list, as is Schroders which last quarter got to within a whisker of its 10-year ranking of 16th. </p> <p>About 65 funds are included in the rankings which show that it is the smallest funds which have produced the best returns. Nine out of the top 10 are investing less than \u00a3200m, peanuts in comparison with the \u00a35bn or so the likes of Mercury has to handle. Orbitex, second last quarter but first over the past 12 months, claims to manage just \u00a31m while Fuji, first last quarter, has \u00a367m. For these funds, the telling time could come if the pension fund consultants start to recommend their funds because, as the old names found out to their peril five years ago, this is when the performance is hard to maintain. </p> <p><strong> Name calling </strong> </p> <p>The embarrassing leak of a stock exchange memo, outlining how blame for a possible collapse in merger discussions with Deutsche B\u00f6rse might be off-loaded on to the Germans has revived memories of a competition to find a name for the earlier plan to create a simple alliance between the two. </p> <p>Two years ago when talks first got going, staff at the bourse in Frankfurt were offered the chance to win a weekend in London if they managed to think up the winning name. Likewise, staff in London were offered the chance to win a weekend in Frankfurt. And yes... no one in London bothered to enter the competition.</p>",

Having already pledged to use his \u00a320bn windfall from the auction of new generation mobile phone licenses for paying down debt, Mr Brown is likely to be similarly hair-shirted about locking his latest bonus. Above all the Treasury fears repeating the mistakes made by the previous government in the late 80s when it mistook a temporary surplus in the government's finances as a result of an unheathily booming economy, for a structural shift out of deficit. This time, however, most commentators agree that improvement in the fiscal position is real. Mr Brown's team faces a dilemma. At this stage in the economic cycle, the chancellor cannot spend either the mobile phone windfall or run down his structural surplus without provoking the Bank of England into offsetting the boost to demand with higher borrowing costs. But the sight of the Treasury revelling in loads of money does not fit well alongside the shabby state of Britain's public services. After decades of underinvestment - in everything from roads to public transport to schools and hospitals - even increases likely to be unveiled in this summer's second comprehensive spending review will not repair the tattered fabric of the public sector. The one-off bonus of the mobile phone windfall should not be squandered on tax cuts or spending at the expense of higher interest rates. What is needed is some creative thinking about long-term investment ideas which will not immediately flood the economy with cash and force the Bank to retaliate with higher borrowing costs. The \u00a320bn is a serious amount of money. How to spend it deserves some serious consideration. Top dogs The latest set of figures by Caps, the fund performance measuring firm, are an intriguing read. For one thing, name and brand awareness, the speak of the market executives counts for little. Fuji-Lord Abbett and Orbitex are not household names, but they vie for the top two slots with a return of close to 15% return during the first three months of the year. Languishing at the other end of the much-watched league table are better known firms such as Abbey Life, Britannic, Standard Life and more tellingly Phillips &amp; Drew and Prudential, all of which produced negative returns for their investors. True, it was a difficult period for many of the so-called \"pooled mixed with property funds\" with the median return for the sector at minus 0.4%, the slowest start to an investment year since 1994. To be fair, this is better than the minus 3.4% return of the FTSE All Share index - often used as a benchmark by the major pension fund trustees - during the three month period. But it might be a source of alarm for the trustees, who make the crucial decision about which of the fund management firms should be entrusted with their precious assets, before the recent stock market rout which occurred outside the period of this latest table. The list makes slightly better reading for the giant Mercury Asset Management, which is creeping back up the honours list, as is Schroders which last quarter got to within a whisker of its 10-year ranking of 16th. About 65 funds are included in the rankings which show that it is the smallest funds which have produced the best returns. Nine out of the top 10 are investing less than \u00a3200m, peanuts in comparison with the \u00a35bn or so the likes of Mercury has to handle. Orbitex, second last quarter but first over the past 12 months, claims to manage just \u00a31m while Fuji, first last quarter, has \u00a367m. For these funds, the telling time could come if the pension fund consultants start to recommend their funds because, as the old names found out to their peril five years ago, this is when the performance is hard to maintain. Name calling The embarrassing leak of a stock exchange memo, outlining how blame for a possible collapse in merger discussions with Deutsche B\u00f6rse might be off-loaded on to the Germans has revived memories of a competition to find a name for the earlier plan to create a simple alliance between the two. Two years ago when talks first got going, staff at the bourse in Frankfurt were offered the chance to win a weekend in London if they managed to think up the winning name. Likewise, staff in London were offered the chance to win a weekend in Frankfurt. And yes... no one in London bothered to enter the competition.",

      "body": "<b>A </b> is for asylum seeker. Individuals who claim to be refugees who are waiting for a decision from the Home Office (HO) on their case. <p><b>B</b> is for bogus. A word banned two years ago by former immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, for being pejorative. It prejudged applications when put before the phrase \"asylum seeker\". \"Abusive\" now used instead. </p> <p><b>C</b> is for Campsfield House, near Oxford, the largest immigration detention centre. It is run by Group 4 and has been the scene of hunger strikes and disturbances. About 1,000 asylum seekers are detained because there is evidence they will abscond or because they face imminent removal. About half are held in Haslar and Rochester jails. </p> <p><b>D</b> is for deportations. More than 7,400 failed asylum seekers were removed or departed voluntarily in the year to June 1999. An unknown number left without telling the HO. Those who are deported are not allowed to return while the order is in force. Those removed rather than deported (such as illegal entrants) may come back if they satisfy the immigration rules. </p> <p><b>E</b> is for \"exceptional leave to remain\". This is granted someone who does not qualify as a refugee but has genuine humanitarian reasons for staying in the UK. About 11% of applicants were given ELR last year. </p> <p><b>F</b> is for \"failed asylum seeker\". This is the official term for someone whose application has been rejected after an initial decision and after appeal. </p> <p><b>G</b> is for the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees to which the UK is signatory; it guarantees the right to asylum. It obliges states to consider all applications for asylum by people claiming to be fleeing from persecution. It provides that lawfully resident refugees should enjoy treatment at least as favourable as that given the indigenous population. </p> <p><b>I</b> is for \"illegal immigrant\". This generic term describes those who are in the UK without authority, for example in breach of a deportation order or by evading immigration control or by deceiving officials on arrival. The HO refuses to estimate the number of illegal immigrants on grounds that it is impossible to know how many are here. If they did they would take enforcement action against them. But see migration. </p> <p><b>J</b> is for Lord Justice Simon Brown, the appeal court judge who ruled illegal Peter Lilley's 1996 \"uncompromisingly draconian\" attempt to remove all welfare benefits from asylum seekers on the grounds that it \"contemplates a life so destitute that to my mind no civilised nation can tolerate it\". He ruled that under the 1948 National Assistance Act there was a duty to provide care to and accommodation for asylum seekers. </p> <p><b>K</b> is for the 3,000 Kosovans who now face removal over the next two months as their 12-month temporary permission to remain runs out. </p> <p><b>L</b> is for lorry drivers who now face a \u00a32,000 fine for each illegal entrant discovered travelling in the back of their vehicles. </p> <p><b>M</b> is for migration. In 1997 the total inflow of people intending to stay in the UK for one year or more was 285,000. The outflow leaving to live abroad was 225,000, a net increase of 60,000. </p> <p><b>N</b> is for the national asylum support service which started work on April 3. It is responsible for the programme of dispersal and support for asylum seekers while their claims are decided. It makes asylum seekers a \"no-choice\" offer of accommodation and has sent asylum seekers to Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester. </p> <p><b>O</b> is for overstayer, someone who remains in the UK beyond the permitted time. The HO recognises some may have overstayed without realising it; they will lose their right to appeal against removal from October. </p> <p><b>P</b> is for pre-entry controls which prevent passengers with no claim to enter the UK from travelling in the first place. They include the use of visas to stop those who are not entitled or do not have the necessary documents getting on the plane. Airlines are now routinely fined if they take passengers without proper papers. Airline liaison officers now work abroad to prevent such passengers coming. </p> <p><b>Q</b> is for the queue of asylum seekers waiting for a decision on their case. The backlog stands at 103,000. There is an average wait of 13 months - as a result of the complete breakdown on asylum casework in December 1998 when the bungled introduction of a new computer project reduced the number of decisions to just 800 a month. At that time the backlog stood at 64,000. The asylum process has only just managed to recover with 10,000 decisions being made last month. A special exercise is under way to clear the backlog of people who have been waiting since before 1996. </p> <p><b>R</b> is for refugee. This is someone recognised to have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or holding a political opinion. Some 37% of applicants were recognised as full refugees in 1999. </p> <p><b>S</b> is for the safe third country rule, under which about 10% of asylum seekers find their claims rejected without any consideration of their individual case. This applies where they passed through another country deemed to be safe en route. </p> <p><b>T</b> is for the trend in asylum applications. The record 71,000 asylum applications last year was triggered by the crisis in Kosovo but numbers also surged to record levels in 1993 when Bosnia exploded. It is impossible to predict what next year's overall figures bring as it depends on complex \"push\" and \"pull factors\" including the state of the world. </p> <p><b>U</b> is for unaccompanied children. Last year there were a total of 3,349 new asylum applications from children and young people under 18. </p> <p><b>V</b> is for vouchers which are now being issued to 40% of all asylum seekers instead of benefits. Shops are forbidden from giving cash as change. </p> <p><b>W</b> is for the white list of countries from which the HO assumes that asylum applications are unfounded. The list has included Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ghana, Poland, Romania, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Tanzania. It is to be scrapped in October. </p> <p><b>X</b> is for xenophobia. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \"deep antipathy towards foreigners\". </p> <p><b>Y</b> is for Yugoslavia, the break-up of which has led to the biggest European crisis in asylum in the past 10 years. </p> <p><b>Z</b> is for Zimbabwe, which has 20,000 people who have the right to flee to Britain without the need to go through this asylum system, because they have or had a relative who was born in Britain. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:alan.travis@theguardian.com\">alan.travis@theguardian.com</a></p>",

C is for Campsfield House, near Oxford, the largest immigration detention centre. It is run by Group 4 and has been the scene of hunger strikes and disturbances. About 1,000 asylum seekers are detained because there is evidence they will abscond or because they face imminent removal. About half are held in Haslar and Rochester jails. D is for deportations. More than 7,400 failed asylum seekers were removed or departed voluntarily in the year to June 1999. An unknown number left without telling the HO. Those who are deported are not allowed to return while the order is in force. Those removed rather than deported (such as illegal entrants) may come back if they satisfy the immigration rules. E is for \"exceptional leave to remain\". This is granted someone who does not qualify as a refugee but has genuine humanitarian reasons for staying in the UK. About 11% of applicants were given ELR last year. F is for \"failed asylum seeker\". This is the official term for someone whose application has been rejected after an initial decision and after appeal. G is for the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees to which the UK is signatory; it guarantees the right to asylum. It obliges states to consider all applications for asylum by people claiming to be fleeing from persecution. It provides that lawfully resident refugees should enjoy treatment at least as favourable as that given the indigenous population. I is for \"illegal immigrant\". This generic term describes those who are in the UK without authority, for example in breach of a deportation order or by evading immigration control or by deceiving officials on arrival. The HO refuses to estimate the number of illegal immigrants on grounds that it is impossible to know how many are here. If they did they would take enforcement action against them. But see migration. J is for Lord Justice Simon Brown, the appeal court judge who ruled illegal Peter Lilley's 1996 \"uncompromisingly draconian\" attempt to remove all welfare benefits from asylum seekers on the grounds that it \"contemplates a life so destitute that to my mind no civilised nation can tolerate it\". He ruled that under the 1948 National Assistance Act there was a duty to provide care to and accommodation for asylum seekers. K is for the 3,000 Kosovans who now face removal over the next two months as their 12-month temporary permission to remain runs out. L is for lorry drivers who now face a \u00a32,000 fine for each illegal entrant discovered travelling in the back of their vehicles. M is for migration. In 1997 the total inflow of people intending to stay in the UK for one year or more was 285,000. The outflow leaving to live abroad was 225,000, a net increase of 60,000. N is for the national asylum support service which started work on April 3. It is responsible for the programme of dispersal and support for asylum seekers while their claims are decided. It makes asylum seekers a \"no-choice\" offer of accommodation and has sent asylum seekers to Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester. O is for overstayer, someone who remains in the UK beyond the permitted time. The HO recognises some may have overstayed without realising it; they will lose their right to appeal against removal from October. P is for pre-entry controls which prevent passengers with no claim to enter the UK from travelling in the first place. They include the use of visas to stop those who are not entitled or do not have the necessary documents getting on the plane. Airlines are now routinely fined if they take passengers without proper papers. Airline liaison officers now work abroad to prevent such passengers coming. Q is for the queue of asylum seekers waiting for a decision on their case. The backlog stands at 103,000. There is an average wait of 13 months - as a result of the complete breakdown on asylum casework in December 1998 when the bungled introduction of a new computer project reduced the number of decisions to just 800 a month. At that time the backlog stood at 64,000. The asylum process has only just managed to recover with 10,000 decisions being made last month. A special exercise is under way to clear the backlog of people who have been waiting since before 1996. R is for refugee. This is someone recognised to have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or holding a political opinion. Some 37% of applicants were recognised as full refugees in 1999. S is for the safe third country rule, under which about 10% of asylum seekers find their claims rejected without any consideration of their individual case. This applies where they passed through another country deemed to be safe en route. T is for the trend in asylum applications. The record 71,000 asylum applications last year was triggered by the crisis in Kosovo but numbers also surged to record levels in 1993 when Bosnia exploded. It is impossible to predict what next year's overall figures bring as it depends on complex \"push\" and \"pull factors\" including the state of the world. U is for unaccompanied children. Last year there were a total of 3,349 new asylum applications from children and young people under 18. V is for vouchers which are now being issued to 40% of all asylum seekers instead of benefits. Shops are forbidden from giving cash as change. W is for the white list of countries from which the HO assumes that asylum applications are unfounded. The list has included Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ghana, Poland, Romania, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Tanzania. It is to be scrapped in October. X is for xenophobia. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \"deep antipathy towards foreigners\". Y is for Yugoslavia, the break-up of which has led to the biggest European crisis in asylum in the past 10 years. Z is for Zimbabwe, which has 20,000 people who have the right to flee to Britain without the need to go through this asylum system, because they have or had a relative who was born in Britain. \u00b7 Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor. \u00b7 alan.travis@theguardian.com",

The outside world sees Mr Mbeki as the one person that Mr Mugabe will listen to as South Africa has the economic and political clout to influence the Zimbabwean leader. Mr Mbeki is expected to focus on Britain's obligation to support land redistribution, so as not to antagonise Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>The problem lies in the term of that assistance. Harare insists Britain must compensate white farmers for land confiscated by the government. But Britain argues that the sales must be voluntary and that redistribution must be transparent to ensure the land does not simply end up in the hands of Mr Mugabe's cronies. Britain contributed \u00a344m to land reallocation before suspending the scheme in 1988.</p> <p>The British government insists occupied farms must be vacated before negotiations begin. The increasingly violent occupation of white-owned farms has drawn international condemnation and have forced farmers off their lands when they should be harvesting tobacco, a crucial foreign exchange earner for Zimbabwe's ailing economy.</p> <p>The leaders will also be discussing the war in the Congo, where Zimbabwean and Namibian troops are involved on the side of Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, who has been fighting rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda since August 1998. The war is unpopular in Zimbabwe and has cost the government millions of dollars it can ill afford. Mr Hunzvi and the 4,500-strong Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) are also expected to attend the meeting.</p>",

Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which poses the biggest challenge to Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF in parliamentary elections due in May, called on the summit leaders to put pressure on Mr Mugabe to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe. \"I hope that they will utilise the... meeting in Victoria Falls to put pressure on president Mugabe, [and tell him] that he is pursuing a suicidal path,\" Mr Tsvangirai said. Much is expected of South Africa, although Mr Mbeki has maintained a deafening silence on Zimbabwe's turmoil. The outside world sees Mr Mbeki as the one person that Mr Mugabe will listen to as South Africa has the economic and political clout to influence the Zimbabwean leader. Mr Mbeki is expected to focus on Britain's obligation to support land redistribution, so as not to antagonise Mr Mugabe. The problem lies in the term of that assistance. Harare insists Britain must compensate white farmers for land confiscated by the government. But Britain argues that the sales must be voluntary and that redistribution must be transparent to ensure the land does not simply end up in the hands of Mr Mugabe's cronies. Britain contributed \u00a344m to land reallocation before suspending the scheme in 1988. The British government insists occupied farms must be vacated before negotiations begin. The increasingly violent occupation of white-owned farms has drawn international condemnation and have forced farmers off their lands when they should be harvesting tobacco, a crucial foreign exchange earner for Zimbabwe's ailing economy. The leaders will also be discussing the war in the Congo, where Zimbabwean and Namibian troops are involved on the side of Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, who has been fighting rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda since August 1998. The war is unpopular in Zimbabwe and has cost the government millions of dollars it can ill afford. Mr Hunzvi and the 4,500-strong Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) are also expected to attend the meeting.",

      "bodyText": "The uncle of the teenager shot dead by farmer Tony Martin today dismissed claims that anybody connected with his family had intimidated jurors as \"absolute rubbish\". Martin, 55, was jailed for life at Norwich crown court on Wednesday after being found guilty of murdering 16-year-old Fred Barras, a market trader from a Gypsy travelling family based in Newark, Nottinghamshire. But yesterday it was claimed a juror in the case made allegations during a radio phone-in which could lead to the conviction being thrown out. Mr Barras's uncle, Tony Joines, today denied any members of the young market trader's family had attempted to threaten jurors and rejected reports that the family felt Martin should not have been sentenced to life. Asked by the Today programme if there was any truth in claims of intimidation, he said: \"I find that basically absolute rubbish. How could anybody intimidate them? There was only his mother and his two sisters there, and his dad. How could they intimidate that juror? I don't believe it.\" He said he had never heard anyone connected to the family discussing any plan to intimidate jurors. Mr Joines also said that when his mother-in-law had said to reporters that Martin should not be in prison for life, she had meant that he should not spend the rest of his life in jail. The family felt that the 10-15 years that Martin would probably serve was appropriate to his crime, he said. The conviction of the 55-year-old could be quashed and a re-trial ordered if the claims of jury tampering are proved by court officials after an investigation. Martin's solicitor Nick Makin, who has appealed for anyone who knew of intimidation or harassment of jurors to come forward, said his inquiries about jury tampering were not solely based on the anonymous call made to a breakfast DJ at a Norfolk radio station yesterday. His firm had asked the crown prosecution service to investigate and was also in touch with lawyers from Norwich-based Radio Broadland for a transcript of the conversation, which was not broadcast. The anonymous caller is understood to have indicated she was one of 10 jurors who voted to convict Martin of murder and to have told the presenter: \"This is a decision I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life.\" Later Broadland 102FM issued a transcript of what presenter Rob Chandler said on air. Mr Chandler, who received the telephone call at 7.45am during a phone-in about the Martin trial, said: \"During that song we have just spoken to one of the jurors and they do not wish to be named or come on air but we can report some of the things this person said. \"I think the most powerful thing that this person said was that the last eight days had changed their life. This person now actually feels frightened to leave their house having heard some of the things they heard. They never actually wanted to be on the jury in the first place but did not have any choice over it. \"The most poignant thing that I think they said was that in Tony Martin's situation they would have done the same thing and paid the consequences.\" A spokeswoman for Broadland 102FM said the station had taken the decision to release the details in order to clarify the situation. \"We want to clarify what was said because we feel that it has been misreported in some respects and want to set the record straight.\" She added: \"I have read the transcript of what the alleged juror actually said and what was reported on air and at no point was the word intimidation or pressure or nobbled mentioned at all.\" The spokeswoman said the tape recording of what the alleged juror said was in a safe place and would be handed over to police if requested. The Martin case was conducted under high security and jurors were given numbers so their names would not be revealed in open court. The judge told the jurors that if they were approached last weekend about the case, they should immediately dial 999. The court also heard that a \u00a360,000 price had been put on Martin's head.",

They are on their own. Do not be surprised when someone goes too far. <br><b>Tony Wilcox</b><br> Northwich, Cheshire</p> <p>\u0095 One hopes the jury can sleep sound in their beds with clear consciences after finding a man protecting his home, property and life guilty of murder. Their verdict was yet further evidence that there is no justice in Britain. As for the comments of Norfolk chief crown prose cutor Peter Tidey (\"Action such as taken by Tony Martin can never be tolerated in a civilised society\") and the family of criminal Fred Barrass (\"a loveable rogue\"), they just beggar belief. <br><b>Bradley Roberts</b><br>Grimsby, Lincs</p> <p>\u0095 I regard the conviction as both right and justified. What signal would it have sent out if he had been acquitted: that anybody can take the law into their own hands? The last thing this country needs is to go down the route of America, where people are largely responsible for their own security. Do we want mob rule and vigilante groups? We pay taxes to fund the police force and however slow they may or may not react to burglaries, it is their job to deal with crime not the public's. It is all too easy to take the populist Daily Mail view of \"he got what he deserved\" (the victim), but in this case it is the farmer who got what he deserved, however wrong the actions of the victim were. <br><b>Tim Harvey</b><br>Northwich, Cheshire</p> <p>\u0095 Your story (Farmer jailed for life for murder of teenage intruder, Guardian Unlimited) shocks and amazes me.

      "bodyText": "When are we going to realise that burglary is not a property crime (Life for farmer who shot burglar, April 20)? It is a crime against people and is the worst thing you can do to someone without physically attacking them. It ruins lives, particularly in the case of elderly people and those who live alone. In this proper context, the actions of Tony Martin do not seem so unreasonable or excessive. It was not his property he was defending, but his right to security and peace of mind, without which our lives are worthless. What other protection is there for those in his position? They are on their own. Do not be surprised when someone goes too far. Tony Wilcox Northwich, Cheshire \u0095 One hopes the jury can sleep sound in their beds with clear consciences after finding a man protecting his home, property and life guilty of murder. Their verdict was yet further evidence that there is no justice in Britain. As for the comments of Norfolk chief crown prose cutor Peter Tidey (\"Action such as taken by Tony Martin can never be tolerated in a civilised society\") and the family of criminal Fred Barrass (\"a loveable rogue\"), they just beggar belief. Bradley Roberts Grimsby, Lincs \u0095 I regard the conviction as both right and justified. What signal would it have sent out if he had been acquitted: that anybody can take the law into their own hands? The last thing this country needs is to go down the route of America, where people are largely responsible for their own security. Do we want mob rule and vigilante groups? We pay taxes to fund the police force and however slow they may or may not react to burglaries, it is their job to deal with crime not the public's. It is all too easy to take the populist Daily Mail view of \"he got what he deserved\" (the victim), but in this case it is the farmer who got what he deserved, however wrong the actions of the victim were. Tim Harvey Northwich, Cheshire \u0095 Your story (Farmer jailed for life for murder of teenage intruder, Guardian Unlimited) shocks and amazes me. If a man may not defend his home against invasion, has he any rights at all? Here in Texas, the law recognises a man's fundamental right to defend his home and his property and to have arms for that purpose. If this incident had occurred in Texas, a bleeding-heart liberal prosecutor might have referred Tony Martin's case to a grand jury, but Martin would never have been indicted, much less convicted.

If the housebreaker wishes to commit sodomy on the homeowner, or his wife, or his child, or his dog, must the homeowner submit meekly? One can only suspect that, in Britain, the answer to all of these questions is yes. Michael W Johnson Houston, Texas, USA reddogmike1@excite.com \u0095 To expect a householder to act in a moderate, restrained way in these circumstances is totally unreasonable.

I mean, there I am, the out-of-it-not-really-It girl trying to snort some coke in the back seat, when the cab veers to the left and dumps my stash all over my suede boots. I guess that makes them even more expensive. </p> <p>I'm on my way to my fifth funeral this summer, but the first one for someone I killed. Yeah, that surprised you, didn't it. I murdered my boyfriend, Jeff, but I haven't told anyone. The temple's full. There's the Upper East Side crowd, the Upper West Side crowd, the Eurotrash and the media wannabes. And then there's me, 19-year old Miranda Woke, the girl who might have murdered her boyfriend (did I mention that before?). And all I'm thinking is that I could really do with another bump of coke. </p> <p>Ah, there's Janice. She's a stick-thin ex-model. She's stick-thin 'cos she's a junky; she hardly has a vein left in her body and she's started to eye up her neck. She's also my best friend. Or as close to best friends as junkies get. Not that I'm a junkie. Sure I do a load of coke, dope, Valium and vodka martinis but I don't do heroin. Janice passes me a syringe in the bathroom. OK. So I do do the odd bit of junk now and again. So what? </p> <p>God, I do wish Brett would get out of my life. Brett's the ex that just won't accept he's an ex. \"Hi,\" he says, \"I've been thinking about you a lot.\" </p> <p>\"Well don't strain that brain,\" I reply, because even though I'm always out of it, I'm pretty cool and sassy with a one-liner for every occasion. </p> <p>Oh, shit. I've just remembered Jeff's dead. I think I murdered him by shooting him up with an air bubble. Did I mention that before? I need some more drugs. I'm off to party with Janice. </p> <p>My mum's a rich socialite who had her tucks done in Mexico. She pretty much ignores me. My dad's very rich and is on his fifth wife, a girl three years older than me. He invites me out when he's in town, but then he stands me up. </p> <p>I've just OD'd really badly, but now I've come round I need some more coke, pills, booze, anything. \"You need help,\" Brett and my mum say. \"Here's an airline ticket to Minnesota.\" </p> <p>I spend a week in detox at Hazelford. That's something of a record and makes me pretty cool. There's a lot of losers in rehab; oddly, I feel like I'm in the right place. </p> <p>I also meet an old friend of Jeff's. \"I think I murdered him,\" I confess. </p> <p>\"Well you didn't,\" she says kindly. \"He OD'd.\" That clears that one up, then. </p> <p>\"But he did have AIDS, though.\" </p> <p>I won't bore you with the rest of rehab. The details get lost in translation. My mum said she wanted me to stay with her when I got out, but she was in Europe when I returned. I ignore Janice and decide I quite like Brett really. Now I just pig out on food, read lots of Fay Weldon and go to AA meetings, and from time to time I worry that I've got Aids.

      "bodyText": "You really can't find a decent cab driver in New York these days. I mean, there I am, the out-of-it-not-really-It girl trying to snort some coke in the back seat, when the cab veers to the left and dumps my stash all over my suede boots. I guess that makes them even more expensive. I'm on my way to my fifth funeral this summer, but the first one for someone I killed. Yeah, that surprised you, didn't it. I murdered my boyfriend, Jeff, but I haven't told anyone. The temple's full. There's the Upper East Side crowd, the Upper West Side crowd, the Eurotrash and the media wannabes. And then there's me, 19-year old Miranda Woke, the girl who might have murdered her boyfriend (did I mention that before?). And all I'm thinking is that I could really do with another bump of coke. Ah, there's Janice. She's a stick-thin ex-model. She's stick-thin 'cos she's a junky; she hardly has a vein left in her body and she's started to eye up her neck. She's also my best friend. Or as close to best friends as junkies get. Not that I'm a junkie. Sure I do a load of coke, dope, Valium and vodka martinis but I don't do heroin. Janice passes me a syringe in the bathroom. OK. So I do do the odd bit of junk now and again. So what? God, I do wish Brett would get out of my life. Brett's the ex that just won't accept he's an ex. \"Hi,\" he says, \"I've been thinking about you a lot.\" \"Well don't strain that brain,\" I reply, because even though I'm always out of it, I'm pretty cool and sassy with a one-liner for every occasion. Oh, shit. I've just remembered Jeff's dead. I think I murdered him by shooting him up with an air bubble. Did I mention that before? I need some more drugs. I'm off to party with Janice. My mum's a rich socialite who had her tucks done in Mexico. She pretty much ignores me. My dad's very rich and is on his fifth wife, a girl three years older than me. He invites me out when he's in town, but then he stands me up. I've just OD'd really badly, but now I've come round I need some more coke, pills, booze, anything. \"You need help,\" Brett and my mum say. \"Here's an airline ticket to Minnesota.\" I spend a week in detox at Hazelford. That's something of a record and makes me pretty cool. There's a lot of losers in rehab; oddly, I feel like I'm in the right place. I also meet an old friend of Jeff's. \"I think I murdered him,\" I confess. \"Well you didn't,\" she says kindly. \"He OD'd.\" That clears that one up, then. \"But he did have AIDS, though.\" I won't bore you with the rest of rehab. The details get lost in translation. My mum said she wanted me to stay with her when I got out, but she was in Europe when I returned. I ignore Janice and decide I quite like Brett really. Now I just pig out on food, read lots of Fay Weldon and go to AA meetings, and from time to time I worry that I've got Aids. It's great to be back in the real world. And if you really are pressed - the digested read, digested: Rich daughter of even richer New York socialite takes drugs, goes into rehab, stops taking drugs, writes book about rich daughter of even richer socialite who takes a lot of drugs, goes into rehab and stops taking drugs.",

In Nigeria it's 90%. I used to own the tin mines there until I flooded them in the early 1980s.\" Ever since he began his business career with a valuable stamp collection from his father, Mr Hoogstraten has courted controversy. He now owns large chunks of freehold in Brighton and homes in Cannes, Monte Carlo, Maryland and Florida. In a recent interview he described women as \"chattels\", and admitted to having a mistress in each of his houses. He also has an extensive collection of memorabilia from the slave trade. Mr Hoogstraten's unconventional approach to business was demonstrated in the mid-1960s when he fell out with his partner, threw a grenade at his house, and ended up in prison. He made it into the Guinness Book of Records by having the highest disclosed UK personal tax demand in 1981: \u00a35.3m. More recently he was locked in combat with the Ramblers Association after he blocked a footpath across his estate. The \"great unwashed\", as he called them, won.",

In an interview in today's edition of the Moscow newspaper Kommersant, Mr Maskhadov says his truce order has already resulted in a lull in the fighting, and that he has instructed his forces to release all their Russian captives and anyone being held hostage. The Kremlin, pouring reinforcements into the rebel territory, crowed at what it characterised as a Chechen surrender. \"The current initiative, if it really takes place, shows the deep demoralisation in the ranks of the Chechen fighters,\" said the government's Chechnya spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky. After months of calling the democratically elected Mr Maskhadov an illegitimate leader and war criminal, Moscow recently opened channels of communications with him and said publicly that he could be pardoned for any alleged crimes. One of the main reasons it has previously refused to negotiate with him is the prevailing view that he does not control the warlords running parts of Chechnya and that he could not deliver a peace deal. That suspicion persists, and it is not clear if the ceasefire will be observed by guerrilla leaders radicalised by the brutal war fought by Mr Putin's forces.

The women and children were detained in houses, flats, a sports hall and a secondary school, which were used as military brothels.</p> <p>The indictment says witness 95 and \"HB\" were taken by Serb soldiers to the town's stadium. \"There a large group of soldiers, among them Montenegrins and soldiers from Serbia, stood waiting. That night, countless soldiers gang-raped witness 95 and HB on the benches in the stadium.\"</p> <p>Paul Risley, spokesman for the UN's chief prosecutor at the tribunal, Carla Del Ponte, said many of the victims were children, some as young as 12.</p> <p>Although the witnesses are screened from the public, they face the court officials and the accused standing in the dock.</p> <p>\"It takes a lot of courage to testify, especially with something such as rape,\" Mr Risley said. \"But the rights of the accused are the rights to see [the witness].\"</p> <p>Yesterday witness 78 told the court that she had hidden at her parents' house until August that year. Her father was repeatedly asked by the paramilitaries where she was.</p> <p>Serb soldiers then announced that the Muslim and Croat population would be deported by bus in August. She went with her parents, hoping to leave the town.

      "bodyText": "Her identity reduced for the second time in her young life, witness number 78 delivered heartbreaking testimony at the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague yesterday. The young Bosnian woman's evidence, delivered in short painful sentences from behind a screen, is part of a trial which could overturn centuries of legal precedent by elevating rape and sexual enslavement from violations of the customs of war to the most serious war crimes category of all - crimes against humanity. The outcome of the trial of eight Bosnian Serbs accused of running rape camps in the Bosnian town of Foca in the summer of 1992 will have implications for war crimes trials in Kosovo, Rwanda and East Timor, and for the remaining survivors of the 200,000 \"comfort women\" enslaved by Japanese forces during the second world war. But the release this week of two Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects, Miroslav Tadic and Simo Zaric, for being \"too long\" in pre-trial detention, poses a threat to the hearing, legal experts in the Hague said yesterday. Only three of the eight accused of running rape camps are in court: Dragoljub Kunarac, 39, a paramilitary leader; Radomir Kovac, 39, a military police commander; and Zoran Vukovic, a paramilitary. Two of the others are dead - one killed by French peacekeeping troops while trying to escape arrest - and three remain at large. The tribunal's indictment says Foca was surrounded and overrun by Serbian government and Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces in April 1992. The Bosnian Serb forces then rounded up the majority Muslim population, separating the men, women and children. The women and children were detained in houses, flats, a sports hall and a secondary school, which were used as military brothels. The indictment says witness 95 and \"HB\" were taken by Serb soldiers to the town's stadium. \"There a large group of soldiers, among them Montenegrins and soldiers from Serbia, stood waiting. That night, countless soldiers gang-raped witness 95 and HB on the benches in the stadium.\" Paul Risley, spokesman for the UN's chief prosecutor at the tribunal, Carla Del Ponte, said many of the victims were children, some as young as 12. Although the witnesses are screened from the public, they face the court officials and the accused standing in the dock. \"It takes a lot of courage to testify, especially with something such as rape,\" Mr Risley said. \"But the rights of the accused are the rights to see [the witness].\" Yesterday witness 78 told the court that she had hidden at her parents' house until August that year. Her father was repeatedly asked by the paramilitaries where she was. Serb soldiers then announced that the Muslim and Croat population would be deported by bus in August. She went with her parents, hoping to leave the town. But her weeks of hiding were in vain. They separated her from her father and mother, she said, and told her that she had to \"testify\" to a Serb commander. She was taken to a house used by some of the irregulars to rape women, and was herself immediately raped by two or three soldiers. She could not recall how many - \"I was in a state of shock\". The prosecution asked: \"What did they do specifically?\" There was a pause before she replied: \"They destroyed everything in me.\" Heather Ryan, an observer at the Hague from the Washington legal group Coalition for International Justice, and an expert in witness protection, said the release of the two Bosnian Serb suspects was worrying, because witnesses might not turn up or could be intimidated as a consequence. \"There have been cases of intimidation of witnesses,\" she said. The indictment says that one suspect, Dragan Gagovic, threateded witness 48 after he had raped her that he would \"find her in five different countries if she told anyone that he had raped her\". Ms Del Ponte, was quick to criticise the release, saying in a statement: \"The prosecutor is concerned that the provisional release of these accused will have a very negative impact on the victims and witnesses in this case.\" The two, Miroslav Tadic and Simo Zaric, handed themselves over in 1998. But Ms Del Ponte said that if they did not turn themselves in again, they would never be handed over by the authorities in the Serb half of Bosnia, where war crimes suspects are largely regarded as heroes. The court would probably have to ask Nato peacekeeping troops to arrest them. Last week Ms Del Ponte once again pressed Nato and the west to snatch the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, his army commander, General Ratko Mladic, and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. All are wanted by the court on war crimes charges. A Sarajevo weekly, Slobodna Bosna, reported yesterday that Mr Karadzic hides with about 80 bodyguards at Celebici, a village near Foca. If there are rumours of a Nato raid he moves to a Bosnian Serb army barracks near Visegrad. His wife and children visit twice a month. His right hand man, Momcilo Krajisnik, was arrested last month. Gen Mladic has been seen at football matches in Belgrade, and Mr Milosevic is trying hard to win back international respectability.",

It is an enormous testament to the skills and quality of our workforce. \"Scotland needs to ensure that it has a strong foothold in this dynamic industry.\" He added that the original investment made by Scottish Enterprise in the Dunfermline site and the surrounding infrastructure had also paid off. \"One of Motorola's key requirements was to get this project off the ground as quickly as possible. The fact that we had a facility ready and waiting, with scope for expansion, was a major advantage.\" Christine May, the Fife council leader, said the investment would have a strong effect on the local economy which in recent years had suffered significant job losses in defence related work.",

For the past month he has refused police demands to answer questions in an investigation into the 1995 kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr, the son of his arch-rival Michal Kovac, who was president of Slovakia between 1993 and 1998. Mr Meciar was taken to the capital, Bratislava, and charged with abuse of power and the illegal payment of bonuses to his ministers, amounting to more than $300,000 (\u00a3190,000). He was also fined for refusing to answer police questions. The charges did not relate to the kidnapping. By noon he was released, to the cheers of supporters who had gathered outside the police station. A former boxer turned lawyer, Mr Meciar emerged from the 1989 Velvet Revolution which overthrew the Communist authorities. He founded his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) from one wing of Public Against Violence. He led Slovakia to its independence in 1993. HZDS officials yesterday accused the current government, led by Mikulas Dzurinda, of state terrorism and vowed to hold public protests. The HZDS, which leads in the opinion polls with more than 25%, is pushing for an early election. The government survived an opposition vote of no confidence a week ago. Mr Meciar dominated Slovak politics for most of the 1990s, winning consecutive terms in office before being narrowly defeated by a coalition of four centre parties in 1998. His years of power were marred by growing international condemnation and isolation, and a series of scandals which peaked with the kidnapping affair. On August 31 1995 Michal Kovac Jr was found bruised and dazed in the back of his car just across the Austrian border. He said he had been attacked by masked men on his way to work, beaten up, and forced to drink a bottle of whisky. Mr Kovac was arrested by the Austrian police, as he was wanted for fraud, which he claims was an attempt to frame him. At his trial in Austria in 1996, an agent of the Slovak Secret Service, Oszkar Fegyveres, who claimed he had taken part in the kidnapping, gave evidence in Mr Kovac's defence, and the judge ruled that Mr Kovac was \"kidnapped to Austria against his will\", and set him free. A subsequent police in vestigation in Slovakia ended when a key witness, a former policeman called Robert Remias, died when his car exploded in April 1996. At the same time, another police official, Peter Vacok, accused the government of blocking the investigation. The current government has always accused Mr Meciar and his secret service chief, Ivan Lexa, of ordering the kidnapping to embarrass President Kovac. In March 1998 Mr Meciar ordered an amnesty for all those responsible for the kidnapping, but the case was reopened when the opposition won power. Mr Lexa was later detained but released on bail. No date has been given for the trial of Mr Meciar and Mr Lexa.",

They are going to have a \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn better starting point for next year which means that, other things being equal, Mr Brown will be able to stand up in a year's time and give that much away.\" </p> <p>Government departments underspent their budgets by \u00a33.9bn, while tax receipts were \u00a31.3bn higher than in the Budget forecast. </p> <p>But some analysts warned that if departments carried out the planned spending in the next financial year there would be a substantial loosening of the fiscal stance which could prompt the Bank of England to rein back the economy with higher borrowing costs. </p> <p>\"If \u00a33bn of public spending is carried forward, the fiscal stance will now ease by a substantial 1.2% of GDP in 2000-01,\" warned David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs. \"Public spending could grow by as much as 6.5% in real terms between 1999-00 and 2000-01, further complicating the task of the monetary policy committee.\" </p> <p>The robust health of the public finances will exacerbate the problems facing pension funds which must hold a minimum proportion of blue chip government debt in their investment portfolios. As the government's finances have moved into surplus, the supply of long-dated government borrowing has dried up, forcing up prices. </p> <p>Analysts said the Treasury target of issuing \u00a312bn worth of ten-year gilts next year was out of reach.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Whitehall underspending and buoyant tax revenues have boosted the Treasury's coffers by an extra \u00a34bn in the financial year just ended, leaving the chancellor plenty of room for pre-election tax cuts, official figures showed yesterday. Spending outstripped revenues by \u00a31.4bn in March, the last month of the financial year, but this did not stop the public sector from chalking up a \u00a315bn net surplus for the year as a whole - \u00a34bn more than the chancellor predicted in last month's Budget. \"Money seems to stick to this government,\" said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC markets. \"Once again they've been a bit cautious with their Budget figures. They are going to have a \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn better starting point for next year which means that, other things being equal, Mr Brown will be able to stand up in a year's time and give that much away.\" Government departments underspent their budgets by \u00a33.9bn, while tax receipts were \u00a31.3bn higher than in the Budget forecast. But some analysts warned that if departments carried out the planned spending in the next financial year there would be a substantial loosening of the fiscal stance which could prompt the Bank of England to rein back the economy with higher borrowing costs. \"If \u00a33bn of public spending is carried forward, the fiscal stance will now ease by a substantial 1.2% of GDP in 2000-01,\" warned David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs. \"Public spending could grow by as much as 6.5% in real terms between 1999-00 and 2000-01, further complicating the task of the monetary policy committee.\" The robust health of the public finances will exacerbate the problems facing pension funds which must hold a minimum proportion of blue chip government debt in their investment portfolios. As the government's finances have moved into surplus, the supply of long-dated government borrowing has dried up, forcing up prices. Analysts said the Treasury target of issuing \u00a312bn worth of ten-year gilts next year was out of reach.",

As the prime minister tucked into his breakfast yesterday a formal summons popped through the letterbox demanding that one Anthony C Blair, of 11 Downing Street, present himself for jury service at Southwark crown court. What a chance, he probably muttered to himself over his cornflakes, to demonstrate at first hand the core Blair belief of being \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". As images of a stern prime minister marching up the court steps flashed in front of Mr Blair's eyes, reality struck home, no doubt with the help of his wife Cherie, who sits as a part-time judge. His status as an MP and a barrister means that the prime minister is a member of a select group, including the insane and the clergy, who are barred from jury service. When the prime minister broke the news to Alastair Campbell of how close he had been to a public relations triumph, his spokesman decided that all was not lost. Why not release the letter to the press to show what an ordinary guy Tony is? He may have a grand residence in Downing Street, but as far as the court service computer is concerned he is just a random name on the electoral roll. At yesterday's lobby briefing Mr Campbell produced the letter with a great flourish. Addressed to Mr Blair at 11 Downing Street - the Blairs pinched the chancellor's flat to have enough room for their family - the letter demanded that he turn up at Southwark crown court at 9.15am on June 12. Informing the prime minister that he had been given juror number T60409, the letter issued a stern warning. \"You may have to pay a fine if you do not attend the court service without good reason.\" Thankfully, Mr Blair will not find himself hauled up before the court for failing to turn up. The Lord Chancellor's Department, which is run by his old friend Derry Irvine, noted the mistake, which was believed to be the first time that a prime minister has received a jury summons.

Though the Lords gave the bill an unopposed second reading, peers in all main parties renewed criticisms made by MPs. The minister in charge, Lord Falconer, promised \"a fair hearing\" to any amendments which improveed the bill, much as Jack Straw made conciliatory retreats in the Commons. \"We believe that we have got the balance about right,\" Lord Falconer told peers as he commended the home secretary's \"broad consensus\". Lord Armstrong's rare intervention took the shape of broad support for greater openness in British public life, combined with a mandarin's warning that advice given to ministers by officials like himself - a crucial point of controversy in the bill - must be protected from disclosure. \"I do not believe that those processes can be conducted in a goldfish bowl,\" he told fellow peers. It was impractical to try and divide official advice between that which could be disclosed and that which could not, Lord Armstrong insisted. He also backed protection for traditional collective cabinet responsibility. Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory peers promised to probe key weaknesses in the bill at committee stage. But Lord Armstrong warned that \"it will always be possible for governments to find means by which they can avoid the disclosure of information which they really do not want or think it right to disclose without technically failing to comply with the legislation\". The search for evasive techniques would mean that information could be recorded improperly, passed by word of mouth or on the \"backs of envelopes\", he said.",

There are more awards this year in the innovation and environmental achievement categories but fewer for international trade. </p> <p>Among the 116 successful companies are well-known brand names such as Jaguar, which has picked up an international trade award for the sixth time, and Marks &amp; Spencer's womenswear group - which won an innovation award for its Secret Support vest and bodysuit liner. </p> <p>Other winners include Glasgow-based Traditional Weatherwear, which specialises in mackintoshes and exports them to Europe, the United States and the Far East. </p> <p>Another fashion retailer in the awards line-up is George J Cox of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, which manufactures footwear. </p> <p>The company's biggest line is its retro-style creeper, of which it sells more than 50,000 pairs a year to Japan. </p> <p>One of the companies to be given an innovation award is Marconi Applied Technologies' safety and security group based in Chelmsford, Essex, which makes thermal imaging cameras used by emergency and rescue services. </p> <p>Graseby Dynamics of Watford has won an award for the first time. It manufactures chemical warfare agent detection systems, and its exports have increased fourfold during the past three years. </p> <p>Optare Group of Leeds has been given an innovation award for its Solo low-floor bus, which allows elderly passengers and mothers with pushchairs to get aboard the vehicle more easily. </p> <p>A company which has developed a breast pump to help working mothers has won awards for both innovation and trade. </p> <p>The pump - which is made by the baby products division of the Cannon Avent Group, in Glemsford, Suffolk - is designed to help mothers combine breast and bottle feeding by expressing milk, allowing babies to benefit from breast milk for longer. </p> <p>London-based Mathmos - which makes objects for the home including the lava lamp - has won its second international trade award. </p> <p>One of the organisations to receive an environmental award is Strattons Hotel in Swaffham, Norfolk, which has reduced its energy consumption by 19%. </p> <p>The hotel has introduced a range of energy efficiency projects - including collecting rainwater in an old underground tank. </p> <p>Another is Tesco Distribution, which has been given the award jointly with the Paxton Division of McKechnie Components for developing a reusable transport packaging system which means vehicles have to make fewer journeys. </p> <p>Successful organisations are entitled to fly the award flag and display the emblem on their letterheads, the goods they produce and articles used by employees. </p> <p>This year there is a new award emblem, designed by students Christine Munch and Kjerstin Keller from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, who won a national redesign competition. A Queen's Awards office spokesman said: \"We are delighted with the new emblem. It is simple and elegant and will quickly become an easily recognised symbol of the prestige which a Queen's Award confers.\" </p> <p><strong>The winners</strong></p> <p><strong>\u0095 Queen's Awards for International Trade: </strong></p> <p><strong>AES Engineering</strong>, Rotherham - Sealing systems </p> <p><strong> Abercrombie &amp;

      "bodyText": "Firms making products ranging from buses to lava lamps are among those today granted the Queen's Award for Enterprise 2000. The Queen announced 77 awards for international trade, 32 for innovation and seven for environmental achievement. There are more awards this year in the innovation and environmental achievement categories but fewer for international trade. Among the 116 successful companies are well-known brand names such as Jaguar, which has picked up an international trade award for the sixth time, and Marks &amp; Spencer's womenswear group - which won an innovation award for its Secret Support vest and bodysuit liner. Other winners include Glasgow-based Traditional Weatherwear, which specialises in mackintoshes and exports them to Europe, the United States and the Far East. Another fashion retailer in the awards line-up is George J Cox of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, which manufactures footwear. The company's biggest line is its retro-style creeper, of which it sells more than 50,000 pairs a year to Japan. One of the companies to be given an innovation award is Marconi Applied Technologies' safety and security group based in Chelmsford, Essex, which makes thermal imaging cameras used by emergency and rescue services. Graseby Dynamics of Watford has won an award for the first time. It manufactures chemical warfare agent detection systems, and its exports have increased fourfold during the past three years. Optare Group of Leeds has been given an innovation award for its Solo low-floor bus, which allows elderly passengers and mothers with pushchairs to get aboard the vehicle more easily. A company which has developed a breast pump to help working mothers has won awards for both innovation and trade. The pump - which is made by the baby products division of the Cannon Avent Group, in Glemsford, Suffolk - is designed to help mothers combine breast and bottle feeding by expressing milk, allowing babies to benefit from breast milk for longer. London-based Mathmos - which makes objects for the home including the lava lamp - has won its second international trade award. One of the organisations to receive an environmental award is Strattons Hotel in Swaffham, Norfolk, which has reduced its energy consumption by 19%. The hotel has introduced a range of energy efficiency projects - including collecting rainwater in an old underground tank. Another is Tesco Distribution, which has been given the award jointly with the Paxton Division of McKechnie Components for developing a reusable transport packaging system which means vehicles have to make fewer journeys. Successful organisations are entitled to fly the award flag and display the emblem on their letterheads, the goods they produce and articles used by employees. This year there is a new award emblem, designed by students Christine Munch and Kjerstin Keller from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, who won a national redesign competition. A Queen's Awards office spokesman said: \"We are delighted with the new emblem. It is simple and elegant and will quickly become an easily recognised symbol of the prestige which a Queen's Award confers.\" The winners \u0095 Queen's Awards for International Trade: AES Engineering, Rotherham - Sealing systems Abercrombie &amp;

      "bodyText": "A coroner has written to Jack Straw, the home secretary, seeking permission to open inquests into the deaths of 23 women who could be victims of the serial killer Harold Shipman. John Pollard, the south Manchester coroner, said he was unable to proceed without Mr Straw's approval because the bodies had all been cremated. Shipman, a former GP from Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, was convicted in January of murdering 15 of his women patients with lethal injections of diamorphine. After the trial ended at Preston crown court, the crown prosecution service decided not to proceed with criminal charges against Shipman relating to the 23 patients because he could not be guaranteed a fair hearing. Mr Pollard will also reopen the inquests into the deaths of Sarah Ashworth, Alice Kitchen and Elizabeth Mellor, which were adjourned at the end of 1998 pending further investigation. He is now satisfied that there will be no criminal proceedings following from the deaths of the three women and the in quests will be held as soon as possible. Shipman, who is in Frankland prison, Co Durham, will be informed of the inquests by the coroner and notified of his right to attend the hearings. Mr Pollard has also decided that in all the other deaths which he investigated that there is either no evidence or insufficient evidence to justify him asking Mr Straw to make exhumation orders. Greater Manchester police investigated a total of 150 deaths of Shipman's former patients. \"I have taken this course of action based upon the evidence which is presently before me and particularly based upon the fact that it is my understanding that the families and relatives of the deceased are anxious for the evidence relating to their deaths to be heard and tested by way of inquest,\" Mr Pollard said. \"I would take this opportunity to reiterate that any coroner's inquest is a court of inquiry and not one of determining blame or liability, be that either criminal or civil.\" He said there would be a considerable amount of work involved in the investigation and inquests. The families of some of the 23 women named by Mr Pollard welcomed his letter. Sue McAlpine, whose mother Irene Heathcote is one of the suspected victims, said: \"There are an awful lot of questions surrounding this that need to be answered. Due to the fact that the inquiry is going to be held in private, the only way I can get these answers is through an inquest.\" Helen Blackwell, whose mother Bertha Moss died in Shipman's surgery, said: \"It's a crumb of comfort.

For true aficionados of robot warfare, it is a satisfaction substantially increased by the sight of the creators of the humiliated pieces of machinery being obliged to witness the destruction of their work, their faces a rictus of good-sportsmanship, wearing thin smiles which fail to disguise their pain at the monumental waste of time. </p> <p>Oddly, research suggests that the demographics of the huge audience of BBC2's most-watched show take in virtually every strata of society. It is not just adolescent boys spending a rare few minutes away from their joysticks. Small children love it, grown men can't get enough, women watch in droves. Ah, the unspeakable joy of watching nerds suffer. </p> <p>The brilliance of Robot Wars is that it has the feel of a show that has been waiting to happen for ever. In essence, it is gladiatorial combat to the death, using the only performers whose televised demise is deemed acceptable in these civilised times: machines. The idea, apparently, came when a television executive saw a robot battle at an American trade fair.

Everything about it is a joy, everything charged with nuance. As the commentator, for instance, Jonathan Pearce's breathless hyperbole is perfect. The presenter Craig Charles, with his surly swagger and Red Dwarf cult background, brings a touch of malevolence to the role so much more satisfying than the superior sneer of the original host, Jeremy Clarkson. </p> <p>And then there is Philippa Forrester. </p> <p>I saw a pub comedian this week launch into a ten-minute routine of unrepeatable lasciviousness about Philippa Forrester. Which, since everyone in his audience seemed both to know who she was and to agree with his sentiments, must count as a measure of national prominence. Forrester's role in the programme is to act as pit reporter. She swishes through a side studio decorated to look like a garage, where she gently patronises the competitors as they conduct a final fiddle with their nuts. Importantly, to undertake this task she is kitted out in spray-on leather trousers and a spaghetti-strapped top. She is, very clearly, fragrant. </p> <p>And this is the final, delicious cruelty of the programme. Forrester looks like a woman who has never in her life turned right on entering an aeroplane. Dirt has clearly never dared spend more than a nano-second under her fingernails.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people in Colorado brought their communities to a sombre halt yesterday as they led the US in a national day of commemoration on the first anniversary of the Columbine school massacre. The secondary school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, where two students shot and killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher and wounded 23 others before turning their guns on themselves, was closed for the day in memory of the massacre, the worst school shooting in US history. Survivors, relatives and community leaders asked the media to stay away from the area during a series of private events to mark the anniversary. Several streets were closed by barricades, against which local people placed flowers, messages and teddy bears in memory of those who died in the massacre. The governor of Colorado, Bill Owens, led a service of remembrance at the state capitol building in Denver, beginning with a state-wide minute of silence at 11.21am, the moment at which Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began the attack, which still resonates through American society. \"I think Columbine will be with us for ever,\" he said earlier. As though to underline his point, the anniversary was littered with reminders that the Columbine killings and the national argument about gun violence which they have generated remain unresolved. The parents of one Columbine victim, Daniel Rohrborough, marked the eve of the anniversary by bringing a case against Jefferson county police alleging that their son was killed by a shot fired by a police officer rather than the earlier bullet in the leg fired by Harris and Klebold. The police deny the accusation. Several other US schools decided to close as a precaution after reported threats of violence to mark the anniversary. One was Hinkley high school in Aurora, 20 miles from Columbine. Schools in some parts of Wisconsin and another in New Hampshire shut their doors for the day after rumours of possible violence spread among students. A high school in Alameda, California, decided to stay open after three students were arrested following the discovery of \"hit-lists\" naming 105 students who would be killed on April 20. With schools throughout the US on alert, it fell to a retirement community in Peoria, Arizona, to become the scene of the latest random shooting spree, when a 61-year-old man burst into a meeting of residents, killing two elderly people and wounding three. \"He just came in, stood in the rear of the room and started firing,\" a witness said after Richard Glassel was arrested for opening fire on the residents with a rifle and handguns. Mr Glassel was reported to be angry about a decision to trim back the bushes around his home. The previous day a retired man in Michigan opened fire on his neighbours, killing two, during a meeting which was called to attempt to resolve complaints about his use of bad language to fellow residents of his tower block. While gun-related deaths in schools have fallen by 40% in the last two years, and general gun crime has fallen steadily for most of the last 10 years, the number of Americans shot dead remains exceptionally high by international standards. Columbine has probably done more than any other incident to prompt debate in the US and abroad about America's gun culture. Both presidential candidates used the anniversary to speak about gun violence in schools. Vice-President Al Gore, who went to Columbine after the shooting, called for stricter gun control, while George W Bush urged parents and schools to concentrate on values, culture and character. President Bill Clinton called on congress to mark the anniversary by passing a gun control bill. But no one in Washington, including Mr Clinton, expects one to be passed this year, not least because any radical measure would fall foul of the 2nd amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. The pressure on congress is likely to increase during the build-up to the Million Mom March in Washington on May 14, when hundreds of thousands of people are expected to rally in support of \"sensible\" gun control. Meanwhile the National Rifle Association is broadcasting a video which warns against \"global forces working to destroy the right that makes American freedom the purest on the planet\". It says: \"Third world dictatorships are plotting, through the United Nations, to eliminate your 2nd amendment.\" The US is one of the few countries throught to have more guns than people. Year of multiple murders shocked America April 20, 1999: Two school students kill 12 fellow pupils and a teacher, and then themselves, at Columbine high school, in Littleton, near Denver, Colorado May 20: A student shoots six schoolmates in a school in Conyers, Georgia, exactly a month after Columbine July 13: Seven people shot dead in a domestic killing in Atlanta August 10: A gunman goes on the rampage in a Jewish day-care centre in California, shooting dead a postal worker and wounding five adults and three children September 15: A man kills seven and wounds seven others in a church in Fort Worth, Texas, before turning the gun on himself November 2: Seven people killed in a Xerox Corporation office shooting in Honolulu December 5: Five women shot dead in a Baltimore house December 31: A hotel employee kills four co-workers and a motorist in a shooting spree in Tampa, Florida March 22, 2000: A man shoots four in a Houston church before killing himself April 18: Two people shot by fellow resident of tower block for the retired in Michigan April 19: A man kills two and injures three at a retirement village near Peoria, Arizona",

But asked whether the shadow chancellor might consider a leadership bid after the election, he replied: \"Whatever.\" His attack on Mr Hague was brushed off by the Tory leadership.

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo's closest ally yesterday launched a scathing attack on William Hague, labelling him as a weak leader who had failed to inspire confidence among Tory MPs and party workers. The former minister Eric Forth made clear that he had given up any hope of winning the general election when he warned that polling day was now \"perilously close\". Mr Forth, a key member of the Portillo inner circle, accused Mr Hague of failing to help the party recover from the \"very traumatic\" last election. \"We have lost all our self-confidence and are constantly looking over our shoulders at our own shadow,\" he told BBC2's Despatch Box programme. \"We are getting perilously close to an election and we have not got that political self-confidence to go for firm positions that we can relate to and that people can relate to.\" Mr Forth even criticised the Tory leader's performance in the Commons, one area where he is generally believed to have performed well. Mr Forth said Mr Hague \"had a bad day\" on Wednesday when his attack on government running costs was undermined by the prime minister pointing out that the Tories had benefited from a threefold increase in public funding. Mr Forth insisted that Mr Portillo wanted to remain a loyal member of the shadow cabinet. But asked whether the shadow chancellor might consider a leadership bid after the election, he replied: \"Whatever.\" His attack on Mr Hague was brushed off by the Tory leadership. One source said: \"This is not the first time that a backbencher has apparently criticised the leadership. William is consistently setting out firm positions on a variety of issues.\"",

His pictures, recently displayed at the History Museum in Taipei, reveal Taiwan before the era of transistors, let alone micro-chips. They show a landscape of remote villages, where travelling dentists pulled teeth in the streets, and adults and children alike sat entranced before storytellers. This was a country hardly touched as yet by the mainlanders who had taken it over a few years before, most of whom were still down in Taipei, itself not much more than a provincial Japanese town.</p> <p>It may seem a vanished world in today's factory-dotted Taiwan. But the children in those pictures are still only middle aged, and their attitudes have moulded the ideas of the next generation, now young adults. To these people, particularly those in the more rural south of the island who voted for him in landslide proportions, the election of Chen Shui-bian as president this spring represents a victory and an affirmation. Taiwan had already had a native Taiwanese president in Lee Teng-hui, Chen's predecessor, but Lee was with the Kuomintang (KMT), the mainland party which had dominated the island politically since Chiang Kai-shek took Taiwan over in 1945. Chen Shui-bian, on the other hand, is a Taiwanese leading the mainly Taiwanese Democratic Progressive party, heir to dissident movements that had resisted the KMT monopoly of power at a time when that could lead to prison or worse. The party's objective of independence has been judiciously diluted, but no one doubts that the DPP's guiding principle remains \"Taiwan first\". When Chen is inaugurated next month, the Taiwanese, colonial subjects of the Japanese and then, under the KMT, denied full political rights until democracy began to take hold a decade or so ago, will finally come into their own.</p> <p>Beijing got exactly the result it did not want in this contest, and may have contributed to it by the threats made during the campaign. Since the election China has been relatively restrained, except in its splenetic fury over the suggestion by Annette Lu, Taiwan's new vice-president, that the People's Republic and Taiwan are only \"distant relations\". As for Chen Shui-bian, Beijing has said that it will watch what he does and listen to what he says, but that there can be no negotiations on such matters as a direct commercial relationship or direct transport links unless he accepts the principle of one China.</p> <p>This Chen will not do and thus there is an impasse which, in theory, could last as long as he is in power. At present Taiwan's trade and investment links with China have to dog-leg through Hong Kong, at considerable profit to the former British territory, and it looks as though that will continue. The ludicrous situation in which Taiwan, whose businessmen own perhaps 40,000 factories in China, cannot officially deal with Beijing, will continue.</p> <p>There has been the usual speculation about the chances of military action. But Chairman Mao's rule - \"Never fight a battle unless you are sure you can win it\" - is imprinted in the minds of the Chinese leadership. Whatever they say, or hint, they know that China does not now have the capacity to stage a successful invasion of Taiwan and that an attempt which ended in failure would be a political as well as military disaster of global proportions. The curve of China's growing might will eventually take it to the point - perhaps 10 years from now - where it does have that capacity. As that crossover gets closer the pressure on Taiwan to accept China's view that the island is a wayward province that must return to the fold, will certainly increase. Yet it will still be diffuse, for even a successful invasion of Taiwan could do terrible damage to China's relations with the rest of the world.</p> <p>On the surface, the military moves and counter moves of Beijing, Washington and Taipei concern the real possibility of conflict. But the recurrent dramas arising from Taiwan's efforts to procure advanced weapons from the United States are just as much to do with China's efforts to show Taiwan that it is increasingly isolated, and that the United States can be intimidated. The American decision this week, to sell Taiwan a few of the weapons systems it has requested while withholding others, is typical of this nuanced game, which has been going on for years now. The nature of American politics in the last phase of Clinton's presidency, however, mean that this minor victory for Beijing could have unhappy consequences for the Chinese. Anger in Congress over Taiwan being allegedly left in the lurch could just conceivably lead to the defeat of the China trade bill in the House of Representatives, or even to passage in the Senate of a bill already approved by the House which mandates closer US military cooperation with Taiwan.</p> <p>But what probably matters more than any outside development is that, as a result of the election, the island's political system is in flux. Chen's victory was the result of a falling-out between a leader and his heir apparent worthy of a Shakespeare play, one which cost them the throne. No one knows quite why President Lee Teng-hui fell out with James Soong, who at one time looked certain to be his successor. But their differences led to Lee endorsing another politician, the uncharismatic Lien Chan, as the KMT candidate to follow him in office, and to Soong standing as an independent. Without that split, the KMT would still hold the presidency, which explains why furious KMT supporters called for, and got, Lee's resignation as chairman of the party after the election. Chen will thus govern in a society where the majority did not vote for him. He also faces a legislature in which his party is outnumbered. A difficult exercise in cohabitation lies ahead.</p> <p>The DPP has no experience of government and Chen has had to pick a KMT man to lead his cabinet. But that suggests both that the party will not pursue in office as vigorous an attack on corruption as it promised during the campaign, and that it wants to send a soft signal to Beijing. If so, that will not please some party supporters. Nor will trimming to the needs of big business, because the DPP has a particular following among workers and unionists. Chen himself has uneasy relations with some of the party's founding figures, who regard him as a man come late to the struggle. If the DPP is in for a rough ride, the same is true of the KMT, saddled with a leader who came third but shows no sign of stepping down, and facing the task of proving to the populace that, in spite of its huge commercial holdings and its vast network of patronage, it is ready to part company with the corrupt ways of the past.</p> <p>Then there is the enigma represented by James Soong's new People First party. Will it become a permanent fixture, or wither away? Democracy is entering a volatile period in Taiwan, with uncertain consequences at home and abroad.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

But the recurrent dramas arising from Taiwan's efforts to procure advanced weapons from the United States are just as much to do with China's efforts to show Taiwan that it is increasingly isolated, and that the United States can be intimidated. The American decision this week, to sell Taiwan a few of the weapons systems it has requested while withholding others, is typical of this nuanced game, which has been going on for years now. The nature of American politics in the last phase of Clinton's presidency, however, mean that this minor victory for Beijing could have unhappy consequences for the Chinese. Anger in Congress over Taiwan being allegedly left in the lurch could just conceivably lead to the defeat of the China trade bill in the House of Representatives, or even to passage in the Senate of a bill already approved by the House which mandates closer US military cooperation with Taiwan. But what probably matters more than any outside development is that, as a result of the election, the island's political system is in flux. Chen's victory was the result of a falling-out between a leader and his heir apparent worthy of a Shakespeare play, one which cost them the throne. No one knows quite why President Lee Teng-hui fell out with James Soong, who at one time looked certain to be his successor. But their differences led to Lee endorsing another politician, the uncharismatic Lien Chan, as the KMT candidate to follow him in office, and to Soong standing as an independent. Without that split, the KMT would still hold the presidency, which explains why furious KMT supporters called for, and got, Lee's resignation as chairman of the party after the election. Chen will thus govern in a society where the majority did not vote for him. He also faces a legislature in which his party is outnumbered. A difficult exercise in cohabitation lies ahead. The DPP has no experience of government and Chen has had to pick a KMT man to lead his cabinet. But that suggests both that the party will not pursue in office as vigorous an attack on corruption as it promised during the campaign, and that it wants to send a soft signal to Beijing. If so, that will not please some party supporters. Nor will trimming to the needs of big business, because the DPP has a particular following among workers and unionists. Chen himself has uneasy relations with some of the party's founding figures, who regard him as a man come late to the struggle. If the DPP is in for a rough ride, the same is true of the KMT, saddled with a leader who came third but shows no sign of stepping down, and facing the task of proving to the populace that, in spite of its huge commercial holdings and its vast network of patronage, it is ready to part company with the corrupt ways of the past. Then there is the enigma represented by James Soong's new People First party. Will it become a permanent fixture, or wither away? Democracy is entering a volatile period in Taiwan, with uncertain consequences at home and abroad. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com",

Figures released by the Big Number - a consortium of Britain's 40 phone companies overseeing the move - show that despite a \u00a320m advertising campaign, 63% of the people affected will not know their correct number. While most subscribers were aware that their area code would change, few realised that one or more digits would have to be added to the rest of their number. Other research by Number Master, a technology group, showed that, although having out up with three number alterations in 10 years, 70% of London businesses were unaware when the latest changes take effect. David Hands, a spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"Five years ago when there was a similar change, Oftel [the telephone industry watchdog] told us businesses would not have to change their numbers again during their lifetime. \"I think a lot of people have been confused by the new change, and the message has not been communicated well enough.\" The overhaul will create 400m numbers, and is needed because of an explosion in communications equipment such as mobile phones, pagers and the internet. Dialling codes and telephone numbers will be updated for six British regions: London, Portsmouth, Southampton, Coventry, Cardiff and Northern Ireland - a total of 11.5m lines. Millions more people will need to reprogramme mobile phone memories; businesses will have to spend an estimated \u00a32bn on reprinting stationery and other materials. Local calls, which do not require an area code, will change at 1am tomorrow when callers using an old number will hear a recorded message advising them of the change. However, old and new national numbers, which require an area code, will run in tandem until August 5 when a similar recorded message will be used. Oftel plans to overhaul mobile and pager telephone numbers on April 28, 2001. Ringing the changes The regions below will have area codes altered and extra digits placed at the front of existing numbers. Northern Ireland numbers will be totally restructured and the public is advised to call freephone 0808 2242000 for details of changes. Inner London From (0171) to (020) 7 Outer London From (0181) to (020) 8 Portsmouth From (01705) to (023) 92 Southampton From (01703) to (023) 80 Coventry From (01203) to (024) 76 Cardiff From (01222) to (029) 20",

And so the recent events in Zimbabwe are depicted as the plight of white farmers at the hands of black mobs, rather than the cynical attempt to undermine democracy by an embattled president desperate to retain power.</p> <p>The situation here is highly emotive. Two white women have been raped; two white men have been killed. No decent human being can condone this. The use of violence, terror and misogyny as a political tool is abhorrent and cannot be excused, mitigated or explained away by any reasonable person who professes to believe in democracy or humanism. No Zimbabwean should have their national credentials questioned or undermined as a result of their race or ethnicity. If it was wrong for Norman Tebbit to do it in Britain then it is wrong for Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe to do it here.</p> <p>Now for some context. White Zimbabweans comprise less than half a percent of the total population. The fact that they are small in number does not, in itself, mean that their condition should not be the focus of attention - you can often tell a great deal from a country by the way in which it treats minorities. But there have been six murders of black Zimbabweans in the last two weeks of political violence, one of a pregnant woman, and one alleged rape. Although they account for three quarters of the deaths so far they have not received even a scintilla of the media attention.</p> <p>Focusing on the plight of white farmers and their families, events in Zimbabwe are a white supremacist's dream. Proof, in one simple narrative, that black people are unable to govern themselves, that white women are at the prey of black men and that Africa is full of basket cases who bring their destitution on themselves. Only then do the graphic accounts of rape, pictures of white women clutching her children as black men toyi-toyi (protest dance) a few yards away on the other side of her fence and references to \"uncivilised mobs\" slot into place.</p> <p>Yet if you take all of these deaths - black and white - into account you can begin to understand the motivation for this apparently senseless violence. Only then does it become clear that these murders are not random, but logical; not racial, but political.</p> <p>Zimbabwe is one month away from elections for which a date has not yet been set. For the past 20 years the country has been ruled by one party (Zanu-PF) - and one president: Mugabe. Now the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), is gaining ground while Zanu-PF and Mugabe are haemorrhaging credibility. They are not, as some have suggested, devoid of political legitimacy. If there were an election tomorrow Zanu-PF would still be the largest party. But they would no longer, effectively, be the only party. That prospect has worried them sufficiently to attack their opponents.</p> <p>The killings that have taken place have been, essentially, political. All of the murders bar one were committed against members of the MDC (the other was a black policeman whom Zanu-PF supporters thought was a member of MDC because he had a new bike). Mugabe has whipped up tensions and created a climate of intimidation that could allow him to either postpone the elections, cancel them, or hold them under a state of emergency which would effectively strip them of any pretence of being free or fair.</p> <p>Moreover, what was once a fundamentally sound economy is now in tatters. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment are all high. The price of two litres of milk has risen by 136% in the past year. Queues of up to three hours for petrol are not unheard of. Mugabe and his government have nobody to blame for this but themselves. And since they are not likely to do that in a hurry they have drawn on an age-old British tradition - they look for someone to scapegoat and then play the race card.</p> <p>But, unlike the victimisation of asylum seekers in Britain at present, this is not a straight fight between the powerful and the powerless. White Zimbabweans may be a tiny minority but they own the vast majority of good land. And they did not come by it honestly. They acquired it in much the same way as the war veterans have sought to regain it - under a bloody campaign of organised, armed theft. Two wrongs may not make a right; but it is not feasible to right a wrong in the present while ignoring wrongdoing in the past.</p> <p>So while it is possible to sympathise with the individual suffering of white farmers, it is difficult to take their collective spasm of moral indignation at the current state of affairs seriously. Almost all Zimbabweans, including many whites, believe that for the country to progress there has to be substantial land reform. The MDC say after the economy it is the second most important issue in the forthcoming election. The question is not whether, but how the government goes about it.</p> <p>The farmers' complaints about the demise of democracy are also hard to stomach. These are the people - not all but most - who fought tooth and nail to maintain white minority rule and only surrendered at gunpoint. Mugabe could do with a good lecture on democracy and the rule of law. But he can be forgiven for not taking it from white farmers. It was they who imprisoned him when he was fighting for precisely that. Their conversion to democracy is a relatively recent one. Most support the MDC not because it directly represents their interests but because, according the old dictum, at times of crisis the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p> <p>Similarly it is difficult to fathom with what authority the international community makes its high-minded pronouncements. If Mugabe is a wicked tyrant now then he was no less so a few months ago when the British government tried to defend supplying him with arms to fight the unpopular war in the Congo. Objections to Mugabe's terror is well-founded; but given the scant interest world leaders have shown for human rights violations in Chechnya it is neither consistent nor principled.</p> <p>What is taking place in Zimbabwe is not so much a campaign against whites as a struggle for democracy and human rights. Thanks to Mugabe the issue has been refracted over an unseemly scramble for land in which no one can rightfully claim the moral high ground.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

So while it is possible to sympathise with the individual suffering of white farmers, it is difficult to take their collective spasm of moral indignation at the current state of affairs seriously. Almost all Zimbabweans, including many whites, believe that for the country to progress there has to be substantial land reform. The MDC say after the economy it is the second most important issue in the forthcoming election. The question is not whether, but how the government goes about it. The farmers' complaints about the demise of democracy are also hard to stomach. These are the people - not all but most - who fought tooth and nail to maintain white minority rule and only surrendered at gunpoint. Mugabe could do with a good lecture on democracy and the rule of law. But he can be forgiven for not taking it from white farmers. It was they who imprisoned him when he was fighting for precisely that. Their conversion to democracy is a relatively recent one. Most support the MDC not because it directly represents their interests but because, according the old dictum, at times of crisis the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Similarly it is difficult to fathom with what authority the international community makes its high-minded pronouncements. If Mugabe is a wicked tyrant now then he was no less so a few months ago when the British government tried to defend supplying him with arms to fight the unpopular war in the Congo. Objections to Mugabe's terror is well-founded; but given the scant interest world leaders have shown for human rights violations in Chechnya it is neither consistent nor principled. What is taking place in Zimbabwe is not so much a campaign against whites as a struggle for democracy and human rights. Thanks to Mugabe the issue has been refracted over an unseemly scramble for land in which no one can rightfully claim the moral high ground. \u0095 gary.younge@theguardian.com",

In 1948, in recognition of her design of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, she became the first woman ever to win an Oscar for set decoration, an award that had been called \"interior decoration\" until the previous year.</p> <p>Dillon was also one of the very few woman art directors and designers around until the 1960s, when more and more entered the field. Like many of the best art directors, her work often determined the mood and atmosphere of a film, as well as the visual quality. Although Roger Furse was credited with the art direction on Hamlet, it was mainly Dillon who realised the predominantly sombre sets - the sinuous, maze-like corridors and misty-edged brutal battlements of Elsinore. She always felt that her architectural background was a prerequisite of her success.</p> <p>Carmen Dillon was born in Cricklewood, north-west London, the youngest of six children. One of her sisters, Una, founded the Dillon's bookshops. She had a strict Catholic upbringing, but her parents - her father was a businessman, her mother a teacher - encouraged her in her desire to become an architect.</p> <p>Her interest in the cinema was aroused when she met several art directors, including Vincent Korda and Alfred Junge, while studying in London at the Architectural Association. She liked, what she called, \"the arty side\" of films. She began in the industry working on \"rotten little old films, but very exciting and great fun to do - with as little as \u00a3100 spent on sets.\" She remembered that she was requested not to wear slacks on the set, and once overheard someone say, \"That bloody Carmen Dillon is keeping a man out of a job.\"</p> <p>One of her first big jobs was as assistant to Ralph Brinton on The Mikado (1938), the first film made at Pinewood in Technicolor. But when Brinton was called-up during the Munich crisis, Dillon took over a great deal of the art direction, until Paul Sheriff replaced him.</p> <p>She then worked as assistant art director on a number of Anthony Asquith films, including French Without Tears (1939) and Quiet Wedding (1940), eventually becoming the art director on Asquith's The Demi-Paradise (1943), a wartime propaganda film for which she created the \"typical\" English village into which Soviet engineer Laurence Olivier could be warmly welcomed.</p> <p>A year later, she and Paul Sheriff were experimenting with flattened perspectives, painted backdrops derived from medieval paintings, and stylised landscapes for Olivier's Henry V, effectively contrasting them with location shooting. Dillon worked with Olivier again on Hamlet, Richard III (1955) and The Prince And The Showgirl (1957). Further films under Asquith's direction were The Browning Version (1951) and The Importance Of Being Earnest (1952), for which Dillon created an elegant and witty Edwardian style.</p> <p>As the quality of British films deteriorated in the mid-1950s, and more and more movies were shot on location, the challenges for an art director like Carmen Dillon, whose preference was for period pieces and studio design, were diminished. \"Above all, I wanted to create an illusion of reality,\" she once remarked.</p> <p>She designed a few Doctor films, and a couple of the Carry On series, as well as a number of other run-of-the-mill British comedies, until rescued artistically by Joseph Losey, who employed her on Accident (1967) and The Go-Between (1971). In these two keen analyses of the British class structure, Dillon's simplicity of style has been credited with having toned down Losey's baroque excesses.</p> <p>She continued to work throughout the 1970s, notably on Lady Caroline Lamb (1972), The Omen (1976) and Julia (1977), for which she was now called production designer. She also designed the sets for several stage plays, including Anyone For Denis? at the Whitehall theatre, London. But film remained her true love. \"I think I'm not a good stage designer,\" she once commented. \"When I have designed for stage, it has been rather carefully realistic.\"</p> <p>Carmen Dillon, who never married - believing that her work was a \"wholetime\" job - lived for many years with her two unmarried sisters in a large Edwardian flat off Kensington high street, west London. She spent the last decade of her life in a nursing home, having outlived her siblings.</p> <p>\u0095 Carmen Dillon, art director, born October 25 1908; died April 12 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The art director Carmen Dillon, who has died aged 91, was fortunate to have gained her experience in the 1940s and early 1950s, when most films were shot in a studio and when British cinema made some attempt to equal Hollywood in spectacle. In 1948, in recognition of her design of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, she became the first woman ever to win an Oscar for set decoration, an award that had been called \"interior decoration\" until the previous year. Dillon was also one of the very few woman art directors and designers around until the 1960s, when more and more entered the field. Like many of the best art directors, her work often determined the mood and atmosphere of a film, as well as the visual quality. Although Roger Furse was credited with the art direction on Hamlet, it was mainly Dillon who realised the predominantly sombre sets - the sinuous, maze-like corridors and misty-edged brutal battlements of Elsinore. She always felt that her architectural background was a prerequisite of her success. Carmen Dillon was born in Cricklewood, north-west London, the youngest of six children. One of her sisters, Una, founded the Dillon's bookshops. She had a strict Catholic upbringing, but her parents - her father was a businessman, her mother a teacher - encouraged her in her desire to become an architect. Her interest in the cinema was aroused when she met several art directors, including Vincent Korda and Alfred Junge, while studying in London at the Architectural Association. She liked, what she called, \"the arty side\" of films. She began in the industry working on \"rotten little old films, but very exciting and great fun to do - with as little as \u00a3100 spent on sets.\" She remembered that she was requested not to wear slacks on the set, and once overheard someone say, \"That bloody Carmen Dillon is keeping a man out of a job.\" One of her first big jobs was as assistant to Ralph Brinton on The Mikado (1938), the first film made at Pinewood in Technicolor. But when Brinton was called-up during the Munich crisis, Dillon took over a great deal of the art direction, until Paul Sheriff replaced him. She then worked as assistant art director on a number of Anthony Asquith films, including French Without Tears (1939) and Quiet Wedding (1940), eventually becoming the art director on Asquith's The Demi-Paradise (1943), a wartime propaganda film for which she created the \"typical\" English village into which Soviet engineer Laurence Olivier could be warmly welcomed. A year later, she and Paul Sheriff were experimenting with flattened perspectives, painted backdrops derived from medieval paintings, and stylised landscapes for Olivier's Henry V, effectively contrasting them with location shooting. Dillon worked with Olivier again on Hamlet, Richard III (1955) and The Prince And The Showgirl (1957). Further films under Asquith's direction were The Browning Version (1951) and The Importance Of Being Earnest (1952), for which Dillon created an elegant and witty Edwardian style. As the quality of British films deteriorated in the mid-1950s, and more and more movies were shot on location, the challenges for an art director like Carmen Dillon, whose preference was for period pieces and studio design, were diminished. \"Above all, I wanted to create an illusion of reality,\" she once remarked. She designed a few Doctor films, and a couple of the Carry On series, as well as a number of other run-of-the-mill British comedies, until rescued artistically by Joseph Losey, who employed her on Accident (1967) and The Go-Between (1971). In these two keen analyses of the British class structure, Dillon's simplicity of style has been credited with having toned down Losey's baroque excesses. She continued to work throughout the 1970s, notably on Lady Caroline Lamb (1972), The Omen (1976) and Julia (1977), for which she was now called production designer. She also designed the sets for several stage plays, including Anyone For Denis? at the Whitehall theatre, London. But film remained her true love. \"I think I'm not a good stage designer,\" she once commented. \"When I have designed for stage, it has been rather carefully realistic.\" Carmen Dillon, who never married - believing that her work was a \"wholetime\" job - lived for many years with her two unmarried sisters in a large Edwardian flat off Kensington high street, west London. She spent the last decade of her life in a nursing home, having outlived her siblings. \u0095 Carmen Dillon, art director, born October 25 1908; died April 12 2000",

More than 100 private farms have been invaded since Monday by peasant families who are protesting against the unfair distribution of land in Latin America's largest country, the Landless Movement of Rural Workers (MST) said. The MST had planned to invade 500 properties by the week's end, saying that the number symbolically represents five centuries of rural exploitation. \"We are doing this as a counterpoint to the official celebrations,\" said a spokesman, Nilton Viana. \"We want to show that Brazil is not just the beautiful country portrayed by the elite, but has serious social problems.\" Brazil's long-planned commemoration of the day in 1500 when the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral first spotted the Brazilian coastline is threatening to turn into a public relations disaster, as it has focussed the protests of the country's down-trodden minorities, who say that there is little to celebrate. This week's invasions were largely by the 74,000 families who were living under plastic sheeting in roadside camps, Mr Viana said. Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is taking extra precautions to ensure that the expected 40,000-strong protest, consisting mainly of landless Brazilians, does not end in pitched battles with the police. \"The 500th birthday party is not an invitation to a wake,\" he said.

In recent years, the government has felt obliged to invite international electoral observers and few expect fraud this time around, but the party machinery remains formidable.</p> <p>\"The PRI always wins,\" says Mercedes Hernandez, a domestic servant in Mexico City. Ms Hernandez will vote for the challenger this time because she believes that tackling widespread poverty and the country's high levels of common and organised crime requires a change of regime.</p> <p>As the July 2 presidential election approaches, the Fox campaign has taken off. Most opinion polls show him just a few points behind the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, and far ahead of the other main opposition candidate, the left-leaning Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who many Mexicans believe had the presidency snatched from him by electoral fraud in 1988.</p> <p>\"The horse that catches up is the horse that wins,\" says Mr Fox as he campaigns in a bus painted with his bear-like figure raising a hand in a V-for-victory sign.</p> <p>The Fox campaign intentionally spurns the traditional solemnity and circumlocutions of doing politics in Mexico, inundating the media with ads that reduce the message to one two-letter word - Ya - meaning enough, or now, or at last.</p> <p>The new tact has seen the candidate leaning out of his campaign bus window whistling at passers-by and peppering his speeches with popular slang.</p> <p>\"Faced with the challenge of wresting power from a party in government for 70 years, we knew we needed a strategy so different it could throw the competition off balance,\" Mr Fox says, adding that heading Coca-Cola in Mexico provided an invaluable understanding of promotional techniques.</p> <p>And he is natural communicator, giving each audience an easy-listening version of their concerns as he strides across provincial city platforms with the relaxed pose of a crooner when needed, or addresses a bankers' conference with the confidence of a successful businessman.</p> <p>He appeals to the poor in a language they understand: \"I am going to govern for the 40m Mexicans whose fate has been to dance with the ugliest girl,\" he told a rally in an impoverished rural town.</p> <p>He can appeal to women voters: \"The wonderful women of Mexico deserve total respect and the opportunity to fulfil themselves,\" he proclaimed at another gathering where the female vote was considered key.</p> <p>And he has developed a rapport with the international media: \"I believe that development should be directed by the state in harmony with the market, and that is why I am opening up the third way,\" he explains to a British reporter, echoing Blairisms.</p> <p>Mr Fox's pragmatic populism has angered more dogmatic members of his rightwing National Action party, but with the smell of victory growing stronger, few are complaining.</p> <p>The PRI, meanwhile, plays with a similarly amorphous ideology that glorifies the Mexican revolution while also supporting the global free market.</p> <p>In the past few years the party has reinvented itself as the \"new PRI\", loosening its grip to allow other parties to win local elections and parlia mentary power, as well as democratising candidate selection within its ranks. But while the PRI modernisation helped the greying Mr Labastida begin the campaign with a massive head start, his lacklustre performance so far appears to have favoured the colourful Mr Fox.</p> <p>The PRI campaign team says Mr Labastida's small-scale events thus far are intentional, designed to emphasise his sensitive side, but they promise that mass events closer to polling day will prove the party's organisation is as strong as ever.</p> <p>\"The campaign of that yellow-faced shorty Labastida is sinking. It can't even float,\" Mr Fox tells some well-dressed and carefully coiffed women who stand on their chairs and whoop with delight in his home state of Guanajuato.</p> <p>But for all their enthusiasm, it is hard for many to believe that it is possible to oust the PRI from the presidency and end the world's oldest regime.</p> <p>A rural teacher, Jose de Jesus Martinez, says: \"It is very difficult to pull up a tree that has such deep roots. It is very difficult for Fox to win.\"</p>",

Most opinion polls show him just a few points behind the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, and far ahead of the other main opposition candidate, the left-leaning Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who many Mexicans believe had the presidency snatched from him by electoral fraud in 1988. \"The horse that catches up is the horse that wins,\" says Mr Fox as he campaigns in a bus painted with his bear-like figure raising a hand in a V-for-victory sign. The Fox campaign intentionally spurns the traditional solemnity and circumlocutions of doing politics in Mexico, inundating the media with ads that reduce the message to one two-letter word - Ya - meaning enough, or now, or at last. The new tact has seen the candidate leaning out of his campaign bus window whistling at passers-by and peppering his speeches with popular slang. \"Faced with the challenge of wresting power from a party in government for 70 years, we knew we needed a strategy so different it could throw the competition off balance,\" Mr Fox says, adding that heading Coca-Cola in Mexico provided an invaluable understanding of promotional techniques. And he is natural communicator, giving each audience an easy-listening version of their concerns as he strides across provincial city platforms with the relaxed pose of a crooner when needed, or addresses a bankers' conference with the confidence of a successful businessman. He appeals to the poor in a language they understand: \"I am going to govern for the 40m Mexicans whose fate has been to dance with the ugliest girl,\" he told a rally in an impoverished rural town. He can appeal to women voters: \"The wonderful women of Mexico deserve total respect and the opportunity to fulfil themselves,\" he proclaimed at another gathering where the female vote was considered key. And he has developed a rapport with the international media: \"I believe that development should be directed by the state in harmony with the market, and that is why I am opening up the third way,\" he explains to a British reporter, echoing Blairisms. Mr Fox's pragmatic populism has angered more dogmatic members of his rightwing National Action party, but with the smell of victory growing stronger, few are complaining. The PRI, meanwhile, plays with a similarly amorphous ideology that glorifies the Mexican revolution while also supporting the global free market. In the past few years the party has reinvented itself as the \"new PRI\", loosening its grip to allow other parties to win local elections and parlia mentary power, as well as democratising candidate selection within its ranks. But while the PRI modernisation helped the greying Mr Labastida begin the campaign with a massive head start, his lacklustre performance so far appears to have favoured the colourful Mr Fox. The PRI campaign team says Mr Labastida's small-scale events thus far are intentional, designed to emphasise his sensitive side, but they promise that mass events closer to polling day will prove the party's organisation is as strong as ever. \"The campaign of that yellow-faced shorty Labastida is sinking. It can't even float,\" Mr Fox tells some well-dressed and carefully coiffed women who stand on their chairs and whoop with delight in his home state of Guanajuato. But for all their enthusiasm, it is hard for many to believe that it is possible to oust the PRI from the presidency and end the world's oldest regime. A rural teacher, Jose de Jesus Martinez, says: \"It is very difficult to pull up a tree that has such deep roots. It is very difficult for Fox to win.\"",

      "body": "<p>The strange, claustrophobic lighting; the decadent world of Weimar clubland; weird pre-Lynch images... watching the early 1970s movie adaptation of Steppenwolf you get the feeling of peering down a tunnel into a shadowy past. Now simply a neglected film, Steppenwolf was perhaps too philosophical, too gothic for its time. </p> <p>\"There's no production like pre-production.\" The tall, dark man flashed a smile and a diamond glittered in his teeth. It was 1970, I'd just been introduced to Melvin Abner Fishman. He'd told me he was producing a film of Hermann Hesse's book Steppenwolf, and I was impressed. </p> <p>The chaos within the Steppenwolf's soul was something we beaded people identified with as we tried to break free from accepted conventions. Already three years into pre-production hustle, Fishman was staying at the Ritz and working the room service hard. Weird bits of gossip about interesting movie people issued from his mouth like Hollywood Babylon. He was into Jung and alchemy and told me you are judged on the quality of your magic. Flitting in and out of my life for the next few years, he kept me informed of the grinding process of making such a metaphysical movie. </p> <p>First published in 1927, Steppenwolf had become cult reading in the mid-60s, handed out by Timothy Leary with tabs of LSD. The words \"The price of admittance your mind\" as condition of entry to The Magic Theatre had acid-heads nodding wisely. Pablo the musician with his sweet-smelling cigarettes and unheard-of suggestions was a familiar figure on the scene. All our curiosity about the unconscious seemed to be summed up by Hesse. \"It will be the first Jungian film,\" Fishman said. \"All we need is for someone to walk round deep in thought.\" </p> <p>Although Fishman was very much the auteur of the Steppenwolf project, he needed a co-producer to keep him grounded. Richard Herland, with his blonde college-boy looks, was an ideal counterpart to Fishman's visionary freestyle. Herland was a straight, Fishman took a lot of acid.</p> <p>Herland found himself having to pull Fishman back from some of his wilder conversational gambits as they touted for money. \"Fishman was far too brilliant, he could take people much further than they were willing to go. He would be on one of those riffs where he had almost convinced some guy to do business, then he would flip it in such a way that the guy couldn't go to that cosmic level, in the sense of balance sheets, profit and loss statements.\" </p> <p>The Steppenwolf universe seemed to be in constant flux. The group of the same name bawled \"Born to be Wild\" at us. Fishman and Herland were doing the rounds of Hollywood, trying to get their project off the ground. Fishman had offered Antonioni $1 million - an unheard-of amount in those days - to direct the film. This had brought Carlo Ponti sniffing around, because he had Antonioni under exclusive contract.</p> <p>Their relationship was at a stand-off after the Zabriskie Point flop. It got as far as a kind of surreal casting discussion, Ponti suggesting Walter Matthau for the role of Harry Haller, tormented hero; Fishman telling Ponti he'd been thinking of Jack Lemmon, while, in the kitchen, Sophia Loren was cooking spaghetti as she nursed little Carlo. Antonioni announced the book was unfilmable. </p> <p>Meanwhile, James Coburn had approached Herland, waving contracts, trying to rope Fishman out of the deal. Behind their backs, MGM was trying to poach Steppenwolf scriptwriter Fred Haines, whose screenplay for Ulysses had just received an Oscar nomination. Herland bumped into Marlon Brando buying a copy of Steppenwolf in a Beverly Hills bookstore. John Frankenheimer, hot from The Manchurian Candidate and Birdman of Alcatraz, was another power player who wanted complete control. Herland came to realise all these deals would have been Faustian. No big studio would risk such an eclectic project without destroying the spirit of the book. </p> <p>While Fishman dropped acid with Leary, Herland would be courting studio executives on Dean Martin's tennis court. Turning up with a financier's lawyer at Fishman's Beverly Hills shack, Herland found him sitting naked and Buddha-like on the lawn with the sprinklers full on. He was sampling some psylocibin he was planning to initiate Herland with. \"You don't feel the wet,\" he told them gleefully. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it was Fishman who had built up the invaluable relationship with the Hesse family, which, after an 18-month charm offensive, had enabled the negotiation of a tricky clause in Hesse's will previously prohibiting the sale of film rights to his work.</p> <p>At one point, Fishman and Herland found themselves in competition with Conrad Rooks, the rich Avon cosmetics junkie kid, looking to take the next step after his self-reflecting film Chappaqua, featuring William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. I came across Rooks in 1968 in the basement all-night restaurant in The Royal Garden hotel, which was a good place to recover from Saturday night's Unlimited Freak Out. Four years later and he was holding court to members of the Hesse family on his oversized yacht in Cannes harbour. But Rooks, with fortunes at his disposal, was too stoned to remember which book he was after except that it began with S. He ended up with Siddhartha. </p> <p>Herland and Fishman had no such financial resources. Herland, with some minor film production deals already under his belt, managed to cobble together the $150,000 needed for the rights, and decamped the team from the big-time bullshit of Hollywood to Basle, Switzerland, the home of LSD, and, coincidentally, where Steppenwolf was written.</p> <p>A production team of eight moved into a house, supported by Herland as he desperately juggled finances to keep the show alive. Fishman announced he was going to make the movie anyway. \"We know Haines wrote the script, now we want to be sure he's read it.\" For three days with a handheld camera, he filmed Haines, wearing Hesse's dressing gown, reading the screenplay beneath a 150-watt lightbulb with a couple of pictures of Hesse in the background. Three hours of film with one image. \"Once you've accepted that he's not going to move, you can make your own movie,\" Fishman said. \"The other film will be the Mickey Mouse version.\" </p> <p>Zig-zagging their way across Europe, touting their project, Herland was starting to feel the pressure of Fishman's obsession. Driving through the Black Forest to meet Dr Bender at the Institute of Parapsychological Studies in order to consult the mythological runes, Herland was overcome with intense paranoia. \"I saw Melvin in the same black light as the night when he gave me the magic mushroom. I felt I had somehow lost my grip on the reality I had pieced together for 34 years and was powerless to avoid floating off into a terrifying world of crazies. I had given my mind to Melvin.\" </p> <p>Finally, Herland came up with a financier, Peter Sprague, a man born into the American industrial aristocracy who liked to think he had a radical image. Timothy Leary, on the run from prison, turned up at the Hesse-Jung Summer Institute, and Fishman had the notion of screen-testing him for the part of Harry Haller. They introduced him to Sprague, who liked him, but Leary blew it by dropping two Sunshine tabs on Sprague, who had a bad trip and had to be cooled out with a handful of valium and a copy of the Financial Times. He called Leary \"that perverter of mankind\". </p> <p>Finally, after seven years, shooting began. Haines took the director's chair, stoked up on the Ritalin which had come gift-wrapped. \"We're film fans,\" said the head of one of the many pharmaceutical companies based in Basle. \"We're drug fans,\" Fishman replied. The cast was a formidable European roll-call: Max von Sydow as tortured Haller; Dominique Sanda, a favourite of Bertolucci and Visconti, the androgynous Hermine; and Pierre Clementi, in his first role since Belle de Jour and two years' incarceration on a dope charge, as Pablo, \"exotic demi-god of love\". None was a native English speaker. The early special effects have a magic long since lost in the onslaught of computer animation. See Pablo pick up a hologram of Hermine and crumple her up like paper. </p> <p>Behind the scenes there was trouble among the producers. Herland ran off with the cutting copy and refused to part with it until Sprague paid up, but this meant finally relinquishing any further control he and Fishman might have had. What followed became a marketing disaster. Eighty prints were struck but the colours were wrong, and Sanda's brilliant blue eyes became brown. It adds strangely to the film's other-worldly quality. </p> <p>By now, Fishman, who had suffered a minor heart attack after taking a Christmas speedball, swung between desperate hope and total despair. His fantasy was in the can, but he'd lost control of it. No one knew quite how broke he was. Two years later, still with Herland, still trying to get their film back from Sprague, who had stuck it away on a shelf somewhere, it was fade-out for Fishman. He had another heart attack, this time fatal, and died with 20 Swiss francs in his pocket, no dream left to dream.</p> <p>\u0095 Steppenwolf will be screened at London's Riverside Studios on Thursday.</p>",

It involves two real people - novelist William Faulkner and fellow southerner, drinker and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson - but that's no guarantee of its veracity.</p> <p>In the late 1930s, Faulkner had to rely on the tender mercies of various satanic studio heads. When he landed at MGM Darryl F Zanuck ordered him to report to Johnson's office to discuss a new movie. Johnson was then a success and Faulkner was not, but they were both proud sons of Dixie, so Johnson's welcome was warm, and coloured by the kind of chivalric courtliness, long obsolete outside the Deep South, which one associates with pillared plantation houses and mint juleps at sundown. </p> <p>Faulkner, who was well versed in such rituals of hospitality, responded in kind by producing from his jacket pocket a pint of bourbon - the primary social lubricant of the old Confederacy. He started picking at the heavy lead foil around the cork but only managed to cut his finger open. When he found he couldn't open the bottle and hold the bleeding finger in his mouth, Faulkner dropped to his knees and removed his hat, which he used as a bowl to catch the blood while he continued to labour with the bottle (which was more important in Faulkner's scheme of things than any injury up to and including a severed head). </p> <p>After much undignified struggling, and with blood now staining his trousers, shirt and tie, the future Nobel prize-winner rose again to his full height and emptied half the bottle down his famously capacious throat. \"How's about a drink, sir?\" he said to his host, whereupon Johnson took the remaining half-pint and necked it all, in a manner most unlike a gentleman. </p> <p>And that was the last anyone saw of the pair for nearly three weeks when, as legend has it, they were tracked down by MGM detectives and found holed up in an Okie camp halfway across the country, boozing it up in the most indescribable squalor. The two fallen gentlemen were dusted down, hosed off, sobered up and once again chained to their studio desks. </p> <p>Since this is, of course, a lovingly embellished legend, it's OK to add one's own embellishments. I've always enjoyed trying to imagine what happened to them in that three-week period. I like to think their marathon alcoholic odyssey included at least one sojourn on a chain-gang, much whoring in Mexican bordellos, the loss of all their drinking-funds at the cock fights in Tijuana, and a romantic interlude involving twin female lion-tamers, preferably with insanely jealous carnival-freak boyfriends. </p> <p>This story has been much on my mind since I saw Keeping the Faith, the indescribably witless directorial debut of actor Ed Norton. This alleged comedy about two best friends, a rabbi (Ben Stiller) and a Catholic priest (Norton), who both fall in love with their childhood friend Jenna Elfman, is so very terrible that I found myself watching it with clenched teeth, frequently casting about the stalls in search of expensive things to break and small children to strangle.</p> <p>One day Ed Norton was being given his directorial head and the next thing he knew, he'd woken up to find himself the star of Keeping the Faith. Forget lion-tamers and Okie camps - this must have been like waking up with a corpse in the bed and a tidemark of bloodstains up the wall to well above eye-level. How did it come to this? </p> <p>Keeping the Faith - which must have been, oh, at least the fourth script in Norton's pile - seems to come from a long-gone era in American ethnic comedy when people still cared about the church and the synagogue. Back then you had Pat O'Brien or Bing Crosby as the genial, piano- playing, Chesterfield-smoking sky pilot, or, worse, the ferociously devout Loretta Young (\"Attila the Nun\" to her enemies) clad in a habit designed to emphasise her splendid breasts and promote all manner of licentiousness. This was the ornate and hypocritical era that began to fade once that Nazi-loving old villain Pius XII took his last one-way ride on the down escalator. </p> <p>And while Norton is setting fire to his vestments and sticking his burnt bum in the font, Stiller is accessing the almost obsolete strain of humour of the 50s Jewish resort nightclubs in the Catskills and the Pochanos where his parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, paid their early comic dues. The script reheats old chestnuts such as the rabbi who faints at his first bris and is always fighting off the horny widows in his congregation.</p> <p>Stiller and Norton, both talented actors in the right vehicle, have no idea how to present friendship on-screen - they look as though they loathe each other - and their chemistry is non-existent. Elfman's a game gal, and a fine comedian, but she, too, is cast adrift by Norton's atrocious, directionless direction, which makes one yearn for the sure and steady directorial hand of (ha!) Emilio Estevez or Kevin Costner. </p> <p>It's amazing how enduring this kind of thing is, though. Not the humour per se, but its ability to attract a 1953 audience at the dawn of the 21st century. My good friend Kevin (a Catholic raised in the shadow of Pius XII) makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas each February to hook up with his college friends from back east for a long weekend of unspeakable degeneracy, reckless gambling, avant-garde alcohol abuse, and God knows what else.</p> <p>This year they all paid $60 to see Jerry Lewis at one of his packed-out nightclub appearances. \"We went with one intention - to laugh at him, not with him,\" said Kevin afterwards. Jerry was about as contemporary as Keeping the Faith, heavy on jokes about Japanese transistors that were old before the fall of Saigon. Sample joke: \"A Chinaman takes five chopsticks and drops them on a trashcan lid. Pying! Dong! Wap! Bing! And that's how these guys name their kids!\" </p> <p>The oldsters in the packed club just ate this shit up, slanty-eye jokes and everything. They're the sector of the audience that helped Keeping the Faith rise to the number three spot this week. The youngsters, meanwhile, were laughing at the sheer suburban awfulness of it all. Perhaps I should have gone to the new Sandra Bullock movie instead. It can't have been any worse.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"I think, as time goes on, I'm getting more and more English,\" Stephen Frears announces, as he contemplates his antipasti in a Notting Hill trattoria, just down the road from his home. \"I wouldn't know what to do in Hollywood. This is where I live.\" </p> <p>It's just the kind of mission statement you might expect from a director who's turned the filmic spotlight on the complexities of domestic class and culture, whether set among the thrusting Thatcherite immigrant entrepreneurs of 1985's My Beautiful Laundrette - the movie which brought him to international attention - or mavericks clawing and scheming their way out of the working-class ghetto, both in his Joe Orton biopic Prick Up Your Ears, and his adaptations of Roddy Doyle's The Snapper and The Van. </p> <p>Hang on, though - wasn't this also the man who made one of the definitive American road movies in The Grifters, meticulously anatomised the court machinations of 18th-century France in Dangerous Liaisons, and, most recently, helmed the finest Sam Peckinpah western the man himself never made, complete with cattle drives and dusty rodeos, last year's The Hi-Lo Country? </p> <p>We should at least be back on familiar terrain with Frears's latest movie, High Fidelity, an adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel about a manic-depressive, north London second-hand record shop owner who consoles himself through serial break-ups with obsessive Top 5 list-making. Somewhere in development hell, however, John Cusack acquired the rights to the book, assembled his Grosse Pointe Blank writing team, and shifted the location from London to Chicago, with Cusack himself - not the first face that would spring to mind when contemplating the doleful character of Rob - in the leading role. </p> <p>It turns out to be these two factors that attracted Frears to the project. \"I'd read the book,\" he says, \"and though I found it enjoyable, it didn't really chime with me; it's not about my generation. But I liked the idea of John doing it; he's been a friend since we did The Grifters. And while I was as sceptical as anyone about the change of setting, it finally appealed to me, because it made it less parochial; it stops it being about England.\" </p> <p>\"That's sort of the problem with English films, isn't it?\" he asks, warming to his theme. \"England is all they're ever about, and if they're not, they're even worse. This country is just not a very interesting subject. It's terribly limited.\" </p> <p>It sounds contradictory - an English film director who feels intensely English, who's ambiguous at best when it comes to making films about England because he doesn't find England interesting. But then, Frears himself cuts a rather contrary figure. A youthful-looking 58, his bushy black hair greying above the ears, he resembles a rumpled, trendy don. He is, in fact, a visiting tutor at the National Film School in Beaconsfield, and his soft-spoken manner can change from avuncular bonhomie to icy patrician disdain with quicksilver speed. </p> <p>For instance, when I venture a remark that 70% of High Fidelity appears to be delivered straight-to-camera by Cusack, he's indignant: \"That's stupid, a wild exaggeration. It's nothing like that, you don't know what you're talking about. It's more like 7%.\" </p> <p>The next minute, he's asking my opinion on which of the new breed of British film directors has \"got it\" (for the record, the only one he really rates is Kevin Allen, who made Twin Town and The Big Tease - \"he seems a very clever boy\").</p> <p>In some ways, he's the embodiment of the establishment that came of age in the late 60s and early 70s - he abandoned his Cambridge law degree to work as assistant director to Karel Reisz on 1966's Morgan - A Suitable Case For Treatment, and repeatedly refers, luvvie-like, to \"Lindsay\" (Anderson), \"Ridley\" (Scott), \"Ken\" (Loach), \"Les\" (Blair), or \"Mike\" (Newell and Leigh). However, he also portrays himself simply as a workaday movie-maker who's generally been lucky with his projects (though he passed on Thelma &amp; Louise), despite the fact Cusack puts him \"in the front rank\" of directors working today. </p> <p>\"It doesn't feel like that from where I stand,\" he shrugs. \"It's not that there are 15 offers sitting around and people begging me to do them. There's generally one thing that captures my imagination and, like a spoilt child, I'll go off and do it, whether it's set in Dublin or Illinois.\" </p> <p>But not, perhaps, Notting Hill. Despite living in the area for 20 years with painter Anne Rothenstein and their three sons and daughter, Frears hasn't seen the film of the same name, \"except occasional bits over people's shoulders on planes\", and looks blank when I mention the legendary Blue Door.</p> <p>\"I'm not really interested in it,\" he claims. \"That's what I mean about English films - they're generally so cosy. I think what we've done with High Fidelity is kept the spirit of the book but universalised the story. There are differences - the character of Rob probably has more sexual confidence, but that's partly a function of setting it in the States, where they seem less neurotic about that kind of thing, and partly because it wouldn't be too convincing having John being that gauche - but Nick Hornby told me he's very pleased with it.\" </p> <p>Given the variety of his output, what exactly constitutes \"A Stephen Frears Film\"? Some critics have compared him to Howard Hawks; like that Hollywood eminence, Frears is a director who, from his debut with Gumshoe in 1972, has transcended genres and settings by focusing on the human drama at the heart of a story. \"Hawks, eh?\" says Frears. \"Well, I was brought up to film what was in front of me, to concentrate on the people at hand, rather than go on some interior journey or get into elaborate framings or effects. I don't think in terms of high concepts.\" </p> <p>Perhaps this explains his facility to coax sterling, often career-best performances from his actors: one thinks of Anjelica Houston's murderous rage in The Grifters or Glenn Close's manic method of make-up removal in Dangerous Liaisons. \"I'm interested in those moments where people reveal their true natures,\" he says. \"And I think the actors in my films are very good and I admire them. I find I say less and less to them; I'm doing as little direction as possible these days, because I tend to make things worse. </p> <p>\"Being on a movie set is very intimate; it's like being with your family. It's a sort of organic process; I never quite know what the thing's going to be about before I start but, on a good day, it sorts itself out and you breathe life into it. I'm not terribly analytical - I go entirely from the gut. I make sure I work with good writers like Hanif Kureishi and Alan Bennett, and have them on hand to deal with that stuff. My natural inclination is to protect the actors while we work things out. I become completely paternal,\" he guffaws. </p> <p>For Frears, casting is the key element. One of his biggest contributions to High Fidelity, he says, was to keep Jack Black, who plays Cusack's boorish assistant, on board. \"Jack's a bolter,\" says Frears, \"and I brought him back twice because I had faith in him. Sometimes you're amazed by the stuff you get. Like Annette Bening, on the first day of The Grifters: she started doing incredible things. If you can photograph that delight, those moments of discovery, you just keep your mouth shut and get on with it.\" </p> <p>While Frears has certainly made films in the States, he's at pains to point out that he's never \"gone Hollywood\". \"I don't think I've ever taken a meeting in my life,\" he demurs. \"I've yet to have a film green-lit, as it were.\" He's \"rather disapproving\" of young British directors who fashion their movies as Hollywood calling-cards. \"I'm a little old-fashioned in that way. My generation was lucky; up until 1988, the idea of a British director going to Hollywood was inconceivable. It just wasn't on offer. And we didn't sit around moaning about it; it just wasn't what people expected or valued. We just got on with it.\" </p> <p>In fact, his crab-like progress between modestly-mounted UK and US indies garnered him a reputation as an on-time, on-budget safe pair of hands; it was only when he tackled a pair of studio behemoths, 1992's Accidental Hero, starring Dustin Hoffman as a thief who helps the victims of a plane crash, and 1996's Mary Reilly, with Julia Roberts, that Frears came a cropper. </p> <p>\"I didn't know how you filmed a plane crash,\" shudders Frears. \"And it's not that Dustin was difficult, but having big stars skews the movie; you have to concentrate on this enormous investment.

I knew that before I started. It was full of great design and photography, but it should have been a little BBC film.\" </p> <p>These experiences brought on what he describes as \"five or six very difficult years where I lost my confidence\". It wasn't until he began working on The Hi-Lo Country that he got \"the old feeling\" back. High Fidelity, with its youthful optimism and buoyant soundtrack - could this possibly be a portrait of Frears's current state of mind? \"Maybe,\" he confirms. \"People say it's positively jaunty compared to my normal films.\" </p> <p>However, about that perennial Aunt Sally, the renaissance of the British film industry, Frears is less sanguine. \"Is there a British film industry?\" he asks plaintively. \"Where is it?

      "bodyText": "\"I think, as time goes on, I'm getting more and more English,\" Stephen Frears announces, as he contemplates his antipasti in a Notting Hill trattoria, just down the road from his home. \"I wouldn't know what to do in Hollywood. This is where I live.\" It's just the kind of mission statement you might expect from a director who's turned the filmic spotlight on the complexities of domestic class and culture, whether set among the thrusting Thatcherite immigrant entrepreneurs of 1985's My Beautiful Laundrette - the movie which brought him to international attention - or mavericks clawing and scheming their way out of the working-class ghetto, both in his Joe Orton biopic Prick Up Your Ears, and his adaptations of Roddy Doyle's The Snapper and The Van. Hang on, though - wasn't this also the man who made one of the definitive American road movies in The Grifters, meticulously anatomised the court machinations of 18th-century France in Dangerous Liaisons, and, most recently, helmed the finest Sam Peckinpah western the man himself never made, complete with cattle drives and dusty rodeos, last year's The Hi-Lo Country? We should at least be back on familiar terrain with Frears's latest movie, High Fidelity, an adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel about a manic-depressive, north London second-hand record shop owner who consoles himself through serial break-ups with obsessive Top 5 list-making. Somewhere in development hell, however, John Cusack acquired the rights to the book, assembled his Grosse Pointe Blank writing team, and shifted the location from London to Chicago, with Cusack himself - not the first face that would spring to mind when contemplating the doleful character of Rob - in the leading role. It turns out to be these two factors that attracted Frears to the project. \"I'd read the book,\" he says, \"and though I found it enjoyable, it didn't really chime with me; it's not about my generation. But I liked the idea of John doing it; he's been a friend since we did The Grifters. And while I was as sceptical as anyone about the change of setting, it finally appealed to me, because it made it less parochial; it stops it being about England.\" \"That's sort of the problem with English films, isn't it?\" he asks, warming to his theme. \"England is all they're ever about, and if they're not, they're even worse. This country is just not a very interesting subject. It's terribly limited.\" It sounds contradictory - an English film director who feels intensely English, who's ambiguous at best when it comes to making films about England because he doesn't find England interesting. But then, Frears himself cuts a rather contrary figure. A youthful-looking 58, his bushy black hair greying above the ears, he resembles a rumpled, trendy don. He is, in fact, a visiting tutor at the National Film School in Beaconsfield, and his soft-spoken manner can change from avuncular bonhomie to icy patrician disdain with quicksilver speed. For instance, when I venture a remark that 70% of High Fidelity appears to be delivered straight-to-camera by Cusack, he's indignant: \"That's stupid, a wild exaggeration. It's nothing like that, you don't know what you're talking about. It's more like 7%.\" The next minute, he's asking my opinion on which of the new breed of British film directors has \"got it\" (for the record, the only one he really rates is Kevin Allen, who made Twin Town and The Big Tease - \"he seems a very clever boy\"). In some ways, he's the embodiment of the establishment that came of age in the late 60s and early 70s - he abandoned his Cambridge law degree to work as assistant director to Karel Reisz on 1966's Morgan - A Suitable Case For Treatment, and repeatedly refers, luvvie-like, to \"Lindsay\" (Anderson), \"Ridley\" (Scott), \"Ken\" (Loach), \"Les\" (Blair), or \"Mike\" (Newell and Leigh). However, he also portrays himself simply as a workaday movie-maker who's generally been lucky with his projects (though he passed on Thelma &amp; Louise), despite the fact Cusack puts him \"in the front rank\" of directors working today. \"It doesn't feel like that from where I stand,\" he shrugs. \"It's not that there are 15 offers sitting around and people begging me to do them. There's generally one thing that captures my imagination and, like a spoilt child, I'll go off and do it, whether it's set in Dublin or Illinois.\" But not, perhaps, Notting Hill. Despite living in the area for 20 years with painter Anne Rothenstein and their three sons and daughter, Frears hasn't seen the film of the same name, \"except occasional bits over people's shoulders on planes\", and looks blank when I mention the legendary Blue Door. \"I'm not really interested in it,\" he claims. \"That's what I mean about English films - they're generally so cosy. I think what we've done with High Fidelity is kept the spirit of the book but universalised the story. There are differences - the character of Rob probably has more sexual confidence, but that's partly a function of setting it in the States, where they seem less neurotic about that kind of thing, and partly because it wouldn't be too convincing having John being that gauche - but Nick Hornby told me he's very pleased with it.\" Given the variety of his output, what exactly constitutes \"A Stephen Frears Film\"? Some critics have compared him to Howard Hawks; like that Hollywood eminence, Frears is a director who, from his debut with Gumshoe in 1972, has transcended genres and settings by focusing on the human drama at the heart of a story. \"Hawks, eh?\" says Frears. \"Well, I was brought up to film what was in front of me, to concentrate on the people at hand, rather than go on some interior journey or get into elaborate framings or effects. I don't think in terms of high concepts.\" Perhaps this explains his facility to coax sterling, often career-best performances from his actors: one thinks of Anjelica Houston's murderous rage in The Grifters or Glenn Close's manic method of make-up removal in Dangerous Liaisons. \"I'm interested in those moments where people reveal their true natures,\" he says. \"And I think the actors in my films are very good and I admire them. I find I say less and less to them; I'm doing as little direction as possible these days, because I tend to make things worse. \"Being on a movie set is very intimate; it's like being with your family. It's a sort of organic process; I never quite know what the thing's going to be about before I start but, on a good day, it sorts itself out and you breathe life into it. I'm not terribly analytical - I go entirely from the gut. I make sure I work with good writers like Hanif Kureishi and Alan Bennett, and have them on hand to deal with that stuff. My natural inclination is to protect the actors while we work things out. I become completely paternal,\" he guffaws. For Frears, casting is the key element. One of his biggest contributions to High Fidelity, he says, was to keep Jack Black, who plays Cusack's boorish assistant, on board. \"Jack's a bolter,\" says Frears, \"and I brought him back twice because I had faith in him. Sometimes you're amazed by the stuff you get. Like Annette Bening, on the first day of The Grifters: she started doing incredible things. If you can photograph that delight, those moments of discovery, you just keep your mouth shut and get on with it.\" While Frears has certainly made films in the States, he's at pains to point out that he's never \"gone Hollywood\". \"I don't think I've ever taken a meeting in my life,\" he demurs. \"I've yet to have a film green-lit, as it were.\" He's \"rather disapproving\" of young British directors who fashion their movies as Hollywood calling-cards. \"I'm a little old-fashioned in that way.

And we didn't sit around moaning about it; it just wasn't what people expected or valued.

I'm sure I could handle it now, but at the time it knocked me down like a train.

      "body": "<p>Arthur Sale, who has died aged 87, would not have fared well in the streamlined world of modern higher education. He published virtually nothing during more than 50 years as an academic. He quietly abandoned lecturing, finding it not to his taste. He had little time for high-table niceties and no time at all for committees, college politics or faculty intrigue. He just taught. </p> <p>He was a brilliant, enthralling, inspiring teacher. You would climb the rickety stairs to his room in the 15th-century eves of the first court at Magdalene College, Cambridge. A pot of coffee would be produced and some homemade biscuits. He would proudly show off the latest etchings by his son, Bevis, or some rare first edition of an obscure 19th-century novel he had chanced upon that morning. He would then settle down and listen patiently as you falteringly read him your weekly essay. </p> <p>There was never a word of criticism. He would pick up on some theme you'd touched on - however leaden or clich\u00e9d - and talk enchantingly for the rest of the hour. There seemed no book, poem or play in the western canon that he hadn't read, and that he could not illuminate. He would mix a flow of completely personal literary perceptions with quietly subversive political asides and digressions on such passions as mid-war smallholdings or modern American TV. </p> <p>The oddity was to find him at Magdalene College, which traditionally catered more for followers of the hunt and students of land economy than the critical theories of IA Richards or FR Leavis. He was as un-Magdalene a figure as you could hope to meet, which may explain why he retained the hybrid status of \"fellow-commoner\" to the end. </p> <p>Arthur Sale was born in Willenhall, Staffordshire, the son of an engineer and lay preacher. He was educated at West Bridgford grammar school and Nottingham University. He first arrived in Cambridge in the 1930s, teaching correspondence courses at an institute run by London University - something he kept up during the war (he was a conscientious objector) despite the offer of a job by the university. </p> <p>It was not until 1957 that the offer of a university post was repeated. By then, Sale had settled in the village of Girton, some three miles out of town. Despite a weak heart, he would walk to and from college every day - initially through fields, latterly down the traffic-choked Huntingdon Road. </p> <p>His sole written contribution to literary criticism was the introduction to the poems of George Crabbe. Two volumes of his own poems emerged, 25 years apart. They were rejected by Fabers as \"woefully obscure,\" a criticism which gave him unreasonable pleasure. </p> <p>One of Sale's first pupils was Bamber Gascoigne, who later spoke of \"his unsurpassable range of knowledge, his personal humility, his extreme critical severity.\" Nicholas Snowman, now running Glyndebourne, remembers how \"he found out what you were interested in, and, whatever it was, he'd know all about it. In my case, it was Henry James and Edith Wharton, and he'd make me a present of editions I couldn't otherwise have got hold of.\" </p> <p>Benedict Nightingale, the Times's theatre critic, was another student who owes a debt to those hours in Sale's attic: \"You felt very much at ease with him. You knew he wasn't going to throw his intellectual weight around. He accepted one's amateurism, and his relative powerlessness in the college made him far easier to deal with.\" </p> <p>John Simpson, of the BBC, who thought Sale \"the best teacher of English in the University of Cambridge\", was another student. Sale was pleased to follow the progress of his former pupils, though one sensed a certain disappointment in those - quite a numerous band - who ended up in journalism. Re-meeting Simpson recently, he observed: \"You split an infinitive in Afghanistan.\" Simpson tried to explain that he was under heavy gunfire at the time. It cut no ice. </p> <p>Favoured students were invited to the whitewashed 40s Girton bungalow at weekends, or to Sale's cottage at Southwold. His former pupils bonded into a sort of club. Membership was rewarded by long, immaculately written - in every sense - letters. Half a dozen of us made the pilgrimage back to Cambridge five years ago, and were briefly embraced back into his world: his friendship with Henry Moore, his passion for Richard Jeffries and the American novel, his dry observations on contemporary culture and politics. </p> <p>His first wife, Nell - a fellow student at Nottingham and an ever-welcoming presence at Girton - died in 1989. Their other son was Jonathan Sale, the journalist. Later, he married Penny Moffett, to whom, until recently, he read each night from a novel, surrounded by his books and in the shadow of the willow tree which was a constant metaphor in his poetry. </p> <p>\u0095 Arthur Sale, tutor in English, born August 7 1912; died April 18 2000</p>",

He published virtually nothing during more than 50 years as an academic. He quietly abandoned lecturing, finding it not to his taste. He had little time for high-table niceties and no time at all for committees, college politics or faculty intrigue. He just taught. He was a brilliant, enthralling, inspiring teacher. You would climb the rickety stairs to his room in the 15th-century eves of the first court at Magdalene College, Cambridge. A pot of coffee would be produced and some homemade biscuits. He would proudly show off the latest etchings by his son, Bevis, or some rare first edition of an obscure 19th-century novel he had chanced upon that morning. He would then settle down and listen patiently as you falteringly read him your weekly essay. There was never a word of criticism. He would pick up on some theme you'd touched on - however leaden or clich\u00e9d - and talk enchantingly for the rest of the hour. There seemed no book, poem or play in the western canon that he hadn't read, and that he could not illuminate. He would mix a flow of completely personal literary perceptions with quietly subversive political asides and digressions on such passions as mid-war smallholdings or modern American TV. The oddity was to find him at Magdalene College, which traditionally catered more for followers of the hunt and students of land economy than the critical theories of IA Richards or FR Leavis. He was as un-Magdalene a figure as you could hope to meet, which may explain why he retained the hybrid status of \"fellow-commoner\" to the end. Arthur Sale was born in Willenhall, Staffordshire, the son of an engineer and lay preacher. He was educated at West Bridgford grammar school and Nottingham University. He first arrived in Cambridge in the 1930s, teaching correspondence courses at an institute run by London University - something he kept up during the war (he was a conscientious objector) despite the offer of a job by the university. It was not until 1957 that the offer of a university post was repeated. By then, Sale had settled in the village of Girton, some three miles out of town. Despite a weak heart, he would walk to and from college every day - initially through fields, latterly down the traffic-choked Huntingdon Road. His sole written contribution to literary criticism was the introduction to the poems of George Crabbe. Two volumes of his own poems emerged, 25 years apart. They were rejected by Fabers as \"woefully obscure,\" a criticism which gave him unreasonable pleasure. One of Sale's first pupils was Bamber Gascoigne, who later spoke of \"his unsurpassable range of knowledge, his personal humility, his extreme critical severity.\" Nicholas Snowman, now running Glyndebourne, remembers how \"he found out what you were interested in, and, whatever it was, he'd know all about it. In my case, it was Henry James and Edith Wharton, and he'd make me a present of editions I couldn't otherwise have got hold of.\" Benedict Nightingale, the Times's theatre critic, was another student who owes a debt to those hours in Sale's attic: \"You felt very much at ease with him. You knew he wasn't going to throw his intellectual weight around. He accepted one's amateurism, and his relative powerlessness in the college made him far easier to deal with.\" John Simpson, of the BBC, who thought Sale \"the best teacher of English in the University of Cambridge\", was another student. Sale was pleased to follow the progress of his former pupils, though one sensed a certain disappointment in those - quite a numerous band - who ended up in journalism. Re-meeting Simpson recently, he observed: \"You split an infinitive in Afghanistan.\" Simpson tried to explain that he was under heavy gunfire at the time. It cut no ice. Favoured students were invited to the whitewashed 40s Girton bungalow at weekends, or to Sale's cottage at Southwold. His former pupils bonded into a sort of club. Membership was rewarded by long, immaculately written - in every sense - letters. Half a dozen of us made the pilgrimage back to Cambridge five years ago, and were briefly embraced back into his world: his friendship with Henry Moore, his passion for Richard Jeffries and the American novel, his dry observations on contemporary culture and politics. His first wife, Nell - a fellow student at Nottingham and an ever-welcoming presence at Girton - died in 1989. Their other son was Jonathan Sale, the journalist. Later, he married Penny Moffett, to whom, until recently, he read each night from a novel, surrounded by his books and in the shadow of the willow tree which was a constant metaphor in his poetry. \u0095 Arthur Sale, tutor in English, born August 7 1912; died April 18 2000",
