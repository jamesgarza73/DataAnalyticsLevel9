      "body": "<p>Almost ten years to the day since then environment secretary Michael Portillo gleefully \"topped out\" the steel cap to Canary Wharf, the Docklands monument to capitalism has come of age. In a low-key announcement yesterday, the stock exchange confirmed that Canary Wharf is to join the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>It has been a long, bumpy road, but the tallest building in Britain is finally winning acceptance. The main tower at 1 Canada Square is 99.9% full, two more towers are nearly finished and Canary Wharf has this week agreed to take control of a further slice of land on the bank of the River Thames. </p> <p>A recent surge in the company's share price has taken the value of Canary Wharf to \u00a33.8bn, which means the family of chief executive Paul Reichmann is sitting on a stake worth \u00a3255m. The group is even considering a bid for the site of the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>However, it has hardly been an easy ride. On the windy November day in 1990 when the tower was completed, Mr Portillo declared: \"The prophets of doom, with their nonsense about white elephants, have already been proved wrong.\" </p> <p>He was soon to swallow his words, as the site's Toronto-based developer Olympia &amp; York put Canary Wharf into administration. It became a symbol of the unsustainable excess of Thatcherism. </p> <p>Too many buildings had gone up in London, causing a collapse in rents when the economy slowed down. It was years before demand for office space caught up with supply. Canary Wharf acquired an image problem that it has never truly shaken off - of soulless nightlife, poor transport links and hostile surrounding neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Yet for all its critics, Canary Wharf has bounced back. Mr Reichmann, the former boss of Olympia &amp; York, led a consortium which bought the company back for \u00a3800m five years ago. </p> <p>Since then, the company has been helped by the continuing growth of the financial services sector and more recently, the birth of thousands of dot.com companies in search of space in central London. </p> <p>Consolidation among banks and stockbrokers has created larger organisations in search of bigger buildings than ever. Canary Wharf has been able to respond more quickly and cheaply than its rivals, partly due to the underground infrastructure of pipes, networks and plumbing laid by its ambitious founders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, developers finally appear to be running out of space in the Square Mile.

      "bodyText": "Almost ten years to the day since then environment secretary Michael Portillo gleefully \"topped out\" the steel cap to Canary Wharf, the Docklands monument to capitalism has come of age. In a low-key announcement yesterday, the stock exchange confirmed that Canary Wharf is to join the FTSE 100 index. It has been a long, bumpy road, but the tallest building in Britain is finally winning acceptance. The main tower at 1 Canada Square is 99.9% full, two more towers are nearly finished and Canary Wharf has this week agreed to take control of a further slice of land on the bank of the River Thames. A recent surge in the company's share price has taken the value of Canary Wharf to \u00a33.8bn, which means the family of chief executive Paul Reichmann is sitting on a stake worth \u00a3255m. The group is even considering a bid for the site of the Millennium Dome. However, it has hardly been an easy ride. On the windy November day in 1990 when the tower was completed, Mr Portillo declared: \"The prophets of doom, with their nonsense about white elephants, have already been proved wrong.\" He was soon to swallow his words, as the site's Toronto-based developer Olympia &amp; York put Canary Wharf into administration. It became a symbol of the unsustainable excess of Thatcherism. Too many buildings had gone up in London, causing a collapse in rents when the economy slowed down. It was years before demand for office space caught up with supply. Canary Wharf acquired an image problem that it has never truly shaken off - of soulless nightlife, poor transport links and hostile surrounding neighbourhoods. Yet for all its critics, Canary Wharf has bounced back. Mr Reichmann, the former boss of Olympia &amp; York, led a consortium which bought the company back for \u00a3800m five years ago. Since then, the company has been helped by the continuing growth of the financial services sector and more recently, the birth of thousands of dot.com companies in search of space in central London. Consolidation among banks and stockbrokers has created larger organisations in search of bigger buildings than ever. Canary Wharf has been able to respond more quickly and cheaply than its rivals, partly due to the underground infrastructure of pipes, networks and plumbing laid by its ambitious founders. Meanwhile, developers finally appear to be running out of space in the Square Mile. Just 2m sq ft of offices are due to become available in the City in the next six months - a figure which has fallen 52% in the last year, and is at its lowest level since 1988. Property analyst John Atkins of HSBC says: \"There is a growing shortage of office space in central London, more particularly of high quality space, and more specifically in large units.\" Surging demand has allowed Canary Wharf to bring forward its plans and it will complete the next stage of its development - towers for HSBC and Citigroup - early next year. Mr Atkins says: \"The one advantange they've got above all the others is speed. They know exactly what's under the ground - they don't have to worry about any archeological remains, unlike the City, and they can throw things up quickly and not too expensively.\" Canary Wharf's estate is creeping out towards both edges of the Isle of Dogs. In its latest expansion, the company yesterday said it was paying \u00a334m to buy out Singapore-based Pidemco and Hotel Properties, its joint venture partners in a riverside site to the west of the main Canada Square.

Also intriguing is Vali and Ameneh by Johannes Maier, a chat between two bilingual Iranian speakers, and you have to listen carefully to hear them slip between the colloquialisms of the two languages. If the video work seems to wisely eschew political content, then this is counteracted by Phil Collins's How to Make a Refugee, a two-screen documentary showing a lifestyle magazine photographing refugees. In a rather obvious indictment of the media, Collins clearly reveals the humiliation of the young boy being photographed. </p> <p>Of course, there is much playfulness on show too. Edward Weldon's small but chunky oil paintings of envelopes, cash tills, and skips are grubby delights, while Cable Car by an artist known simply as Eric is a life-size model in wood. Jennifer Beattie's sculpture, Beautiful Tree, is made of varnished branches which look like barbecued ribs and boast Sellotape clusters for blossom.

The evening's inspiration may be the haunted Harry's line: \"Oh, there must be other ways of talking that would get us somewhere,\" but Imitating the Dog don't succeed in taking us either to unexplored emotional country or one of innovative theatrical practice. This feels like student work, good quality student work, but nonetheless derivative and lacking an original spark or even an original way of looking at the world. </p> <p>Eliot's play concerns the homecoming of Lord Harry Monchensy to his northern family home after an absence of eight years and the drowning of his young wife that leaves him guilt-stricken. The house is ruled over by his domineering mother and is full of dependent relatives. In the course of the evening Harry faces up to the expectations of his family and in rejecting them is released from guilt and ghosts. He heads off into the dawn in search of \"the bright angels\". </p> <p>Imitating the Dog speak Eliot's lines into microphones and intercut them with snippets from the 1965 recording of the play with Flora Robson and Paul Schofield. Pretty soon the stilted, dated dialogue (\"a very few cocktails went a very long way with m'lady,\") becomes quite the most interesting thing about a production that goes from bad to worse as the cast sing Neil Diamond songs, vomit and stuff heads down the toilet. This is more bathroom sink than kitchen sink drama. </p> <p>All the time in the foreground of the stage a video screen takes us on a very long car journey. The headlights eat up the miles as night turns into the grey of early morning and then the promise of a bright new dawn. Regrettably, by this time the young company had lost their way in the dark so completely that I longed for the RSC to appear in their cocktail frocks and give us their recent production of the play. There is something very wrong with new theatre when it starts making you think of the old and creaky rather fondly.

Berlioz exposes him to a series of sensually evoked artificial paradises which fail to satisfy his selfish thirst for experience, then sends him ironically hurtling to the abyss as moral awareness begins to dawn. Faust's consignment of his soul to Mephistopheles coincides with his first altruistic act, namely his decision to save the life of Marguerite whom he has ruined. </p> <p>It's a work with a bleak, mordant vision, couched in music of sensual beauty and garish violence, which serves throughout to befuddle the listener as it does its hero. No one has ever penetrated its ambivalent heart of darkness as well as Davis, the Berlioz conductor par excellence, who takes us on a roller-coaster ride to hell, only pausing to summon up occasional landscapes of sexual and emotional beauty. </p> <p>Berlioz has frequently been described as episodic, but here you're swept away by the inexorability of it all, by the relentless dramatic logic that holds you firmly in its grip. The London Symphony Orchestra respond to him with playing of restless, flickering eloquence that gleams with the deceptive allure of infernal fire. It's a magisterial achievement, in short, though it's not achieved without a few peripheral problems. </p> <p>The London Symphony Chorus sings with supreme intelligence and a sense of bristling excitement, though occasionally the men sound too few in number, while the tenors, thrilling at full throttle, are less assured in quieter passages. I also had doubts about Davis's decision to encourage \"silly voices\" and coarse, open-vowelled pronunciation for the proletarian choruses - the drinkers in Luther's tavern, the peasant women praying at the wayside shrine. </p> <p>The soloists aren't always quite ideally matched, the weak link being the Albanian mezzo Enkelejda Shkosa as Marguerite. It's a fabulous voice, no question, but she's ultimately miscast - there's voluptuousness in the tone that suggests sexual knowledge from the outset rather than questioning innocence in danger of destruction. </p> <p>In her love scenes with Giuseppe Sabbatini's Faust, there is, however, a powerful erotic charge. He, at this point, making alarming noises, is a rutting animal. Elsewhere, he's athletic and virile rather than mellifluous, very much the Byronic, existential rebel rather than the usual self-pitying drip. Opposite him is the Mephistopheles of Michele Pertusi, taking on the role shortly after his awkward incarnation of Hoffmann's demonic nemesis at Covent Garden. He's happier here, avoiding the self-conscious irony that marred his Opera House performances. </p> <p>His Mephistopheles is initially seductive, his voice hovering round \"my beloved Faust\" with seditious, caressing beauty.

They lost a day's play from a match they were winning. Mike Gatting is not a cheat. But that day in Faisalabad he cheated. I don't know why.

Then England would have gone on to win the match. </p> <p>\"The problems were partly an offshoot of the World Cup, which had been a disappointment for both teams. Gatting had played that hopeless reverse sweep in Calcutta when England lost the World Cup final to Australia. And there had been bad feeling between players and umpires on both sides for years. I was heavily involved in Pakistan's fight for neutral umpires and match referees and I'm proud that their introduction began to put things right. </p> <p>\"I don't anticipate any problems this time.

There were at least four decisions that I couldn't believe.

With hindsight I'm not very proud of what happened but I should imagine some of the Pakistanis are not very proud of the way they behaved either. </p> <p>\"Eventually Graham Gooch came down the pitch from the non-striker's end and told me I had to go.

We actually took the field next morning, expecting them to come out. We ended up sitting around on the roller waiting. Later we had a meeting and the players were solid in not wanting to carry on with the tour.

The first two matches, in Lahore and Faisalabad, were only the second and third Tests of my career. In Lahore I didn't touch the ball with my bat in the entire match, but was twice given out caught. And of my four dismissals in those matches they got me out, properly, just the once. </p> <p>\"It was unbelievable stuff. Of the first 30 wickets we lost we reckoned that we had been \"sawn-off\" on about 15 occasions. And we always felt that to take 10 of their wickets we really had to take 15. We had won the three one-day matches 3-0, so we went into the Test series feeling pretty confident. And they were without Imran Khan, too. Mind you, Abdul Qadir bowled so well on pitches that suited him that Pakistan might have won the series even if everything had been normal. </p> <p>\"It was a pity about what happened in Faisalabad because the incident came right at the end of a long, hot day, the penultimate over of the second day. If we had been able to avoid a big scene we were in a winning position. </p> <p>\"Mike Gatting called me in from deep square-leg and told the batsman, who was Salim Malik. But Shakoor Rana accused him of cheating and used swear words that I had not heard from an umpire before or since. My only wish for the current England players is that they let history alone. They should let sleeping dogs lie and go into the series with a positive attitude.\"</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Mike Selvey  had a box seat for the whole affair. Here is his version of events.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>From a personal perspective the end of the cricket world as we knew it came from modest beginnings. As the second day of the second Test was drawing to its conclusion on December 8 1987, I was summarising for Test Match Special. When play was suspended, truthfully, I had not got a clue what was going on out there between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana. </p> <p>\"Perhaps they had more than two men behind square on the legside,\" I ventured, although dead ball, rather than no-ball, had not been called. Anyway the entry in my notebook reads: \"Gatting discussion with umpire\". \"Full and frank,\" I might have added. </p> <p>Earlier in the day we had played a trick on a colleague who had missed the first session by inventing a spoof incident in which Javed Miandad and Gatting had been involved in a fight. If ever fate had been tempted, it was then. </p> <p>The kerfuffle had been simmering for some time, an explosion waiting to happen. Its roots were tangled. England mistrusted the level of probity of sub-continental umpires who, Keith Fletcher used to say, had rewritten the laws and gave you lbw when you hit it and caught when you did not. </p> <p>Pakistan nurtured their own grievances from the Test series between the two sides during the English summer of 1987. They felt England had been arrogant in refusing to allow them to object to the English umpires David Constant and Ken Palmer - whom they mistrusted and despised - while they were under pressure to remove their own umpires at home. Pakistan were keen to see independent umpires in all Tests. </p> <p>To complicate matters further, their captain Javed was determined to outdo his predecessor Imran Khan and beat England by more than a solitary win. </p> <p>The first Test, in the words of those who played in it, was a joke. Countering the imposition on them of Constant and Palmer the previous summer, Pakistan ignored England's objection to Shakeel Khan. Abdul Qadir, who took nine for 56 in the first innings, would have embarrassed England anyway but the umpire made doubly sure. </p> <p>In the second innings Chris Broad was given out caught at the wicket off the slow left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim but refused to leave the crease for a full minute, and then not until he was persuaded to do so by his partner Graham Gooch. That Broad received no more than a \"stern reprimand\" from the England management, who in turn were publicly scathing about the umpiring following the defeat, further incensed the Pakistanis. </p> <p>A Pakistan side that goes ahead at home can usually be relied on to sit on the lead. But Javed, sensing easy prey, wanted a second win.

      "bodyText": "From a personal perspective the end of the cricket world as we knew it came from modest beginnings. As the second day of the second Test was drawing to its conclusion on December 8 1987, I was summarising for Test Match Special. When play was suspended, truthfully, I had not got a clue what was going on out there between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana. \"Perhaps they had more than two men behind square on the legside,\" I ventured, although dead ball, rather than no-ball, had not been called. Anyway the entry in my notebook reads: \"Gatting discussion with umpire\". \"Full and frank,\" I might have added. Earlier in the day we had played a trick on a colleague who had missed the first session by inventing a spoof incident in which Javed Miandad and Gatting had been involved in a fight. If ever fate had been tempted, it was then. The kerfuffle had been simmering for some time, an explosion waiting to happen. Its roots were tangled. England mistrusted the level of probity of sub-continental umpires who, Keith Fletcher used to say, had rewritten the laws and gave you lbw when you hit it and caught when you did not. Pakistan nurtured their own grievances from the Test series between the two sides during the English summer of 1987. They felt England had been arrogant in refusing to allow them to object to the English umpires David Constant and Ken Palmer - whom they mistrusted and despised - while they were under pressure to remove their own umpires at home. Pakistan were keen to see independent umpires in all Tests. To complicate matters further, their captain Javed was determined to outdo his predecessor Imran Khan and beat England by more than a solitary win. The first Test, in the words of those who played in it, was a joke. Countering the imposition on them of Constant and Palmer the previous summer, Pakistan ignored England's objection to Shakeel Khan. Abdul Qadir, who took nine for 56 in the first innings, would have embarrassed England anyway but the umpire made doubly sure. In the second innings Chris Broad was given out caught at the wicket off the slow left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim but refused to leave the crease for a full minute, and then not until he was persuaded to do so by his partner Graham Gooch. That Broad received no more than a \"stern reprimand\" from the England management, who in turn were publicly scathing about the umpiring following the defeat, further incensed the Pakistanis. A Pakistan side that goes ahead at home can usually be relied on to sit on the lead. But Javed, sensing easy prey, wanted a second win. However, having called for a helpful surface in Faisalabad, he came unstuck as England posted a competitive score of 292, with Broad making 116 and Gatting clubbing 79 from 81 deliveries. Then, despite some more questionable umpiring, England made good inroads into Pakistan's innings on the second day, reducing them to 77 for five. They were only 29 runs further on as the day drew to a close, with Eddie Hemmings bowling his off-spin to Salim Malik. He was getting towards the end of his over when the fuse was lit. Keen to get an extra over in before stumps to get at the debutant Aamer Malik, Gatting, at short-leg, summoned David Capel in from the square-leg boundary to save a single, telling the batsman that this was what he was doing. Salim Malik acknowledged. Hemmings was about to start his run-up when Gatting, realising Capel had come too far, gestured from behind his back for him to stop. Shakoor Rana at square-leg decided to intervene, halting play and accusing Gatting of sharp practice. \"It is unfair play,\" he said. \"What is?\" asked a puzzled Gatting. \"You are waving your hand. That's cheating,\" replied Shakoor.

Under protest, and to the disgust of his players, who broke their contract to issue a statement of their own, he did and the game resumed with a day lost. It promptly rained. There was a bizarre finale to it all. Gatting received a letter from Shakoor later on the tour which expressed regret but had had the word \"apologise\" scrubbed out (at the time Gatting chose to keep quiet about this).

      "byline": "Frank Keating",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Forty years ago this Saturday Tottenham Hotspur drew their 12th First Division match of the season with Manchester City at White Hart Lane. They had won the first 11 and were to win their next four. By January 1, with 82 goals for and only 27 against, Spurs had 46 points from 25 matches - the only blemishes being a single defeat by Sheffield Wednesday and another draw, 4-4 against Burnley after the London club had led 4-0. </p> <p>By that time bookmakers were accepting bets only on the points margin of the championship victory. They settled it by the middle of April with four matches to play. They had just one player booked throughout the season and only a single penalty awarded against them. </p> <p>Tottenham then won the FA Cup, at a leisurely 2-0 stroll against Leicester City, and in so doing achieved the \"impossible double\" for the first time in the century. (Newcastle in 1905, Sunderland in 1913 and Manchester United in 1957 had each won the League but lost the Cup final). </p> <p>Spurs were managed by Bill Nicholson, a gruffly avuncular Yorkshireman, and captained by a right-half, Danny Blanchflower, who was Northern Ireland's 1958 World Cup captain and a Celtic dreamer alive to football's creative possibilities. </p> <p>Nicholson, son of a Scarborough horse-drawn cab driver, had been a half-back in Tottenham's Championship team a decade previously - the talented \"push-and-run\" side created by Arthur Rowe. He played for England once, in 1951, but cried off from a second appearance, saying his priority was to keep fit not for England but for Tottenham, who paid his wages. </p> <p>When he took over as manager from Jimmy Anderson, Nicholson set down his philosophy: \"The game has become tense and bound in fears. Everyone's trying to catch sparrows. I aim to recreate Mr Rowe's simple gospel: 'Make it plain, make it accurate, make it quick - especially quick.' First-time passing is the No1 secret; No2 is, 'when not in possession, get into position'.\" </p> <p>In Nicholson's first full season, 1959-60, Tottenham had finished third (behind Burnley and Wolves) and were knocked out in the fifth round of the FA Cup by Blackburn. So he had inherited an impressive squad but before the start of 1960-61 Nicholson crucially added three Scots: the dependable goalkeeper Bill Brown, the delicate touch player John White and, to play alongside Blanchflower in midfield, the tirelessly aggressive Dave Mackay. </p> <p>Returning from a short pre-season tour in Europe, Blanchflower struck a wager with the Tottenham chairman Fred Bearman. \"We will win the Double for you. The game needs it to be achieved and, thanks to your spending in Scotland, we are now the team to achieve it.\" </p> <p>The next day Bernard Joy quoted Blanchflower in the Evening Standard: \"Mind you, football is not really about winning, or goals, or saves or supporters. It's about glory. It's about doing things in style, doing them with a flourish. It's about going out to beat the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom. It's about dreaming of the glory of the Double.\" </p> <p>Within a week the Tottenham of Nicholson and Blanchflower set off on that League passage, still a First Division record, of 11 straight wins. Nor was it so much the victories but the glistening manner in which they were achieved. By the season's end in 42 League matches Spurs had scored an astonishing 115 goals. The runners-up Sheffield Wednesday scored 78. </p> <p>Two-and-a-half million people watched Tottenham in their League and Cup games - an average crowd of 51,266 - believed to be the greatest number of spectators in British football history to watch a club in a single season. </p> <p>Those of a certain generation - and not only in London but a host of football folk all over the world - can, at the drop of a beret or sunhat, recite trippingly off the tongue (Tottenham were fortunate with injuries) the Double side's enduring litany of 11: Brown, Baker, Henry, Blanchflower, Norman, Mackay, Jones, White, Smith, Allen, Dyson. </p> <p>In February Tottenham visited Aston Villa on two successive Saturdays. First, in the League, they prevailed 2-1, the following week more easily in the FA Cup fifth round by 2-0. Between times the Daily Mail interviewed Nicholson and asked him his \"Seven Steps to Spurs' Success\". The manager replied: </p> <p>1. Build-up of pressure through unorthodox moves; </p> <p>2. All-round ability of every player; </p> <p>3. Confidence bordering on cockiness; </p> <p>4. Ability to vary game; </p> <p>5. Failure of opponents to smother attacks; </p> <p>6. Uncanny positional sense of Blanchflower, White and Mackay; </p> <p>7. Intelligence to know when particularly intense pressure must be maintained; </p> <p>Spurs took six points (only two for a win then) from their three Easter matches - 5-0 against Tom Finney's Preston and two strutting victories against Chelsea. When they defeated Wednesday, who had been nagging at them all winter, at an ecstatic White Hart Lane, the League title was achieved. </p> <p>Three Fridays later, on the night before the Cup final at Wembley, Nicholson took his team to the Odeon cinema, Leicester Square, for a special late-night screening of The Guns of Navarone. Afterwards most of the players further relaxed with a couple of beers at their hotel. An Evening News reporter asked Blanchflower if such a pre-final preparation was not taking over-confidence a shade too far. Replied Danny: </p> <p>\"I can only tell you the story of Walter Hagen the golfer. He was up late before a crucial play-off match, and somebody told him, 'I suppose you know your opponent's been long in his bed?' 'Sure,' said Hagen, 'but do you think he's sleeping?'\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago this Saturday Tottenham Hotspur drew their 12th First Division match of the season with Manchester City at White Hart Lane. They had won the first 11 and were to win their next four. By January 1, with 82 goals for and only 27 against, Spurs had 46 points from 25 matches - the only blemishes being a single defeat by Sheffield Wednesday and another draw, 4-4 against Burnley after the London club had led 4-0. By that time bookmakers were accepting bets only on the points margin of the championship victory. They settled it by the middle of April with four matches to play. They had just one player booked throughout the season and only a single penalty awarded against them. Tottenham then won the FA Cup, at a leisurely 2-0 stroll against Leicester City, and in so doing achieved the \"impossible double\" for the first time in the century. (Newcastle in 1905, Sunderland in 1913 and Manchester United in 1957 had each won the League but lost the Cup final). Spurs were managed by Bill Nicholson, a gruffly avuncular Yorkshireman, and captained by a right-half, Danny Blanchflower, who was Northern Ireland's 1958 World Cup captain and a Celtic dreamer alive to football's creative possibilities. Nicholson, son of a Scarborough horse-drawn cab driver, had been a half-back in Tottenham's Championship team a decade previously - the talented \"push-and-run\" side created by Arthur Rowe. He played for England once, in 1951, but cried off from a second appearance, saying his priority was to keep fit not for England but for Tottenham, who paid his wages. When he took over as manager from Jimmy Anderson, Nicholson set down his philosophy: \"The game has become tense and bound in fears. Everyone's trying to catch sparrows. I aim to recreate Mr Rowe's simple gospel: 'Make it plain, make it accurate, make it quick - especially quick.' First-time passing is the No1 secret; No2 is, 'when not in possession, get into position'.\" In Nicholson's first full season, 1959-60, Tottenham had finished third (behind Burnley and Wolves) and were knocked out in the fifth round of the FA Cup by Blackburn. So he had inherited an impressive squad but before the start of 1960-61 Nicholson crucially added three Scots: the dependable goalkeeper Bill Brown, the delicate touch player John White and, to play alongside Blanchflower in midfield, the tirelessly aggressive Dave Mackay. Returning from a short pre-season tour in Europe, Blanchflower struck a wager with the Tottenham chairman Fred Bearman. \"We will win the Double for you. The game needs it to be achieved and, thanks to your spending in Scotland, we are now the team to achieve it.\" The next day Bernard Joy quoted Blanchflower in the Evening Standard: \"Mind you, football is not really about winning, or goals, or saves or supporters. It's about glory. It's about doing things in style, doing them with a flourish. It's about going out to beat the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom. It's about dreaming of the glory of the Double.\" Within a week the Tottenham of Nicholson and Blanchflower set off on that League passage, still a First Division record, of 11 straight wins. Nor was it so much the victories but the glistening manner in which they were achieved. By the season's end in 42 League matches Spurs had scored an astonishing 115 goals. The runners-up Sheffield Wednesday scored 78. Two-and-a-half million people watched Tottenham in their League and Cup games - an average crowd of 51,266 - believed to be the greatest number of spectators in British football history to watch a club in a single season. Those of a certain generation - and not only in London but a host of football folk all over the world - can, at the drop of a beret or sunhat, recite trippingly off the tongue (Tottenham were fortunate with injuries) the Double side's enduring litany of 11: Brown, Baker, Henry, Blanchflower, Norman, Mackay, Jones, White, Smith, Allen, Dyson. In February Tottenham visited Aston Villa on two successive Saturdays. First, in the League, they prevailed 2-1, the following week more easily in the FA Cup fifth round by 2-0. Between times the Daily Mail interviewed Nicholson and asked him his \"Seven Steps to Spurs' Success\". The manager replied: 1. Build-up of pressure through unorthodox moves; 2. All-round ability of every player; 3. Confidence bordering on cockiness; 4. Ability to vary game; 5. Failure of opponents to smother attacks; 6. Uncanny positional sense of Blanchflower, White and Mackay; 7. Intelligence to know when particularly intense pressure must be maintained; Spurs took six points (only two for a win then) from their three Easter matches - 5-0 against Tom Finney's Preston and two strutting victories against Chelsea. When they defeated Wednesday, who had been nagging at them all winter, at an ecstatic White Hart Lane, the League title was achieved. Three Fridays later, on the night before the Cup final at Wembley, Nicholson took his team to the Odeon cinema, Leicester Square, for a special late-night screening of The Guns of Navarone. Afterwards most of the players further relaxed with a couple of beers at their hotel. An Evening News reporter asked Blanchflower if such a pre-final preparation was not taking over-confidence a shade too far. Replied Danny: \"I can only tell you the story of Walter Hagen the golfer. He was up late before a crucial play-off match, and somebody told him, 'I suppose you know your opponent's been long in his bed?' 'Sure,' said Hagen, 'but do you think he's sleeping?'\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>A first senior hat-trick for Emile Heskey was counterbalanced by a head injury to Michael Owen as Liverpool elevated themselves to fourth place in the table yesterday at the expense of an exceptionally poor Derby team. </p> <p>Owen was taken to hospital with six stitches in the back of his head, and possible mild concussion. \"The boy is strong,\" G\u00e9rard Houllier said afterwards, refuting the suggestion that this had been the last straw in a fairly catastrophic week for Owen. </p> <p>Owen was injured in the instant that Heskey scored the first of his goals from Gary McAllister's corner on 17 minutes. As Heskey slipped in front of Rory Delap at the near post, Owen fell in the goalmouth m l\u00e9e and was raising his eyes to watch his fellow striker's glancing header hit the net when Chris Riggott's knee smashed into the back of his skull. </p> <p>The referee, Stephen Bennett, immediately signalled for a stretcher. According to Heskey, Owen was out cold for a moment or two, but he had revived sufficiently by the time the stretcher bearers had carried him to the tunnel to make gestures indicating his desire to return. Instead he was taken to Derbyshire Royal Infirmary for an examination. </p> <p>Owen's misfortune apart, this was a highly satisfactory afternoon for Liverpool's all-England strike force. To judge them by their performance against the bottom club might be ill advised, but Heskey was virtually irresistible while Robbie Fowler, who has started only one Premiership match in 13 months, took Owen's place and made the most of his extended opportunity. His instant through-ball eight minutes after half-time allowed Heskey to smash a spectacular right-foot shot past Mart Poom from just outside the penalty area, and his intuitive flick to Nick Barmby after 66 minutes inspired the low cross from which Heskey bundled the ball home to complete his scoring. </p> <p>Barmby was also involved in the fourth goal, dummying Danny Murphy's pass 10 minutes from the end to give Patrik Berger the opportunity to score with a characteristically splendiferous left-foot drive from 20 yards. But almost the entire Liverpool team deserves the credit for that one, which came at the end of a long and patient build- up that revealed the extent of Derby's mental exhaustion. As the ball pinged around between the red shirts, the home players could only stand and stare. </p> <p>\"I hope today we started our season,\" Houllier said. \"We haven't been satisfied with the play we've played so far. Today we gave a good team performance. The finishing was good, but mainly the passing and movement were better. I give a lot of credit today to the defence, because it's not often you deny any sort of a chance to the opposition. And when you defend well, you can attack freely.\" </p> <p>McAllister and Murphy, who came off the bench when Veggard Heggem stretched a hamstring after five minutes, provided a solid platform for the strikers, who enjoyed themselves at the expense of a highly porous Derby rearguard. After Riggott had left the field just before half-time, Delap and Bjorn Otto Bragstad were unable to cope with the strength of Heskey and the fleetness of Fowler. </p> <p>Both Jim Smith, the Derby manager, and Darryl Powell, his captain, used the word \"passive\" to describe their team's display. \"The way Liverpool played today,\" Smith said, \"we had to be at our very best, and we weren't. We were poor in the first half. That's what did my head in. We just sat off them. We felt after the first half if we stepped up we could get back into the game, but they got stronger. And they were very professional. They didn't showboat. They never stopped closing us down. They are good players and if you allow them to knock the ball around you're going to be in trouble.\" </p> <p>Smith had sent Derby out with five players strung across midfield, but although the Finnish international Simo Valakari, who played against England on Wednesday, showed some nice touches, only the England Under-21 wing-back Seth Johnson displayed the kind of commitment that the manager was demanding. At the back they were simply undermanned, Malcolm Christie was outnumbered up front, and Georgi Kinkladze lost interest. </p> <p>Having asked the fans to save their criticism for the final whistle, Smith was forced to listen to the inevitable boos from those who stayed to the end. \"I can't blame them,\" Powell said. \"This is my fifth year in this league and today is as bad as it's felt. We never really threatened them at any stage. It hurts.\" </p> <p>For Heskey - with only one goal to his name in the league this season - the match represented a thorough justification of Houllier's faith. \"Emile is too nice a guy,\" the manager said. \"He has tremendous assets - he's quick, he's powerful and he's more skilful than he thinks. He needs to believe in himself more, and sometimes he needs to be more selfish.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

For City, it was that moment more than any other that can be traced back as was the catalyst for their remarkable transformation. The turf will be watered lovingly </p> <p>Two-and-a-half years on and Dickov's longevity is surprising everyone - not least Weah. The man who could not hold down a regular place in the Second Division two seasons ago is now the man who is keeping the former World Footballer of the Year on the bench. </p> <p>\"I never have a wage sheet with me in the dug-out,\" Royle stated before the extent of Weah's disaffection became more widely known. \"Because George is the star, there will always be questions asked when he is left out. But Manchester United have Dwight Yorke on the bench and no one makes a fuss of it. </p> <p>\"There will be times when George plays and times when he doesn't. But that goes for everyone. Kevin Horlock is an international player and he was on the bench as well.\" </p> <p>Comparing Weah to Horlock is similar to assessing the different merits of Pavarotti and a karaoke champion but everyone knew what Royle meant. City are ego-free and happy to stay that way. </p> <p>Besides, if possession is nine tenths of the law, Dickov's case would no longer be laughed out of court. The indefatigable little Scottish international striker has added a new dimension to his game and his volleyed goal, catching a dropping ball with the outside of his right foot, illuminated an otherwise murky affair. </p> <p>\"Even now, at the age of 27, he is still learning,\" said Royle. \"It was a goal that would probably have gone in the stands a couple of seasons ago.\" </p> <p>Functional rather than inspirational, Royle's men should survive with something to spare if they can avoid suspensions and injuries. Otherwise this could be a First Division fixture next season. </p> <p>So far this season Bradford have averaged a league goal every three hours 37 minutes and once Alfie Haaland's shot had deflected in off Stuart McCall to double the lead just before half-time the win bonuses could have been counted out there and then. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The turf will be watered lovingly Two-and-a-half years on and Dickov's longevity is surprising everyone - not least Weah. The man who could not hold down a regular place in the Second Division two seasons ago is now the man who is keeping the former World Footballer of the Year on the bench. \"I never have a wage sheet with me in the dug-out,\" Royle stated before the extent of Weah's disaffection became more widely known. \"Because George is the star, there will always be questions asked when he is left out. But Manchester United have Dwight Yorke on the bench and no one makes a fuss of it. \"There will be times when George plays and times when he doesn't. But that goes for everyone. Kevin Horlock is an international player and he was on the bench as well.\" Comparing Weah to Horlock is similar to assessing the different merits of Pavarotti and a karaoke champion but everyone knew what Royle meant. City are ego-free and happy to stay that way. Besides, if possession is nine tenths of the law, Dickov's case would no longer be laughed out of court. The indefatigable little Scottish international striker has added a new dimension to his game and his volleyed goal, catching a dropping ball with the outside of his right foot, illuminated an otherwise murky affair. \"Even now, at the age of 27, he is still learning,\" said Royle. \"It was a goal that would probably have gone in the stands a couple of seasons ago.\" Functional rather than inspirational, Royle's men should survive with something to spare if they can avoid suspensions and injuries. Otherwise this could be a First Division fixture next season. So far this season Bradford have averaged a league goal every three hours 37 minutes and once Alfie Haaland's shot had deflected in off Stuart McCall to double the lead just before half-time the win bonuses could have been counted out there and then. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The reserve goalkeeper was called off the bench in the 71st minute when Nigel Martyn injured his groin and now England's No2 will be watching from the sidelines as his replacement forms the last line of defence in a series of games that could make the labours of Hercules look like a beach party in Corfu. During that time Leeds play, among others, Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool, Milan and Chelsea - some key to the first-team door for a back-up keeper with just five first-team appearances behind him before Saturday and who turned 21 only yesterday. But he was not about to let it faze him. \"The lads have just made me aware of it in the dressing room,\" he said. \"But if you want to play for Leeds you have got to play in these sort of games.

That the margin of the home side's victory was so slender was a travesty - Julio Arca had what appeared to be a legitimate goal ruled out, \u00e0 la Ray Parlour in Helsinki, when his shot cannoned off the underside of the crossbar, and the visitors' goalkeeper Ed de Goey was at full stretch to deny Niall Quinn on three occasions. </p> <p>Indeed, Quinn should have opened the scoring after 62 minutes but, under challenge from Mario Melchiot, his point-blank header was clawed out by De Goey. The referee Jeff Winter penalised Melchiot's tug on the Irishman's shirt and Kevin Phillips thumped home the penalty. </p> <p>Phillips had been linked with a move away from Wearside to further his England chances, much to his man ager's amazement.\"If he has got a problem, he hasn't told me,\" said Reid. \"On the whole big club thing, Andy Cole plays for Manchester United and he struggles to get into the England team.

I've played for England while I've been here and it would be daft of me to want to leave. We've showed we can mix it with the big boys.\" </p> <p>And mix it they did, although the 66th-minute fracas that left both sides a player short was probably not what Phillips had in mind. Graeme le Saux, who had been booked for a foul on Kevin Kilbane earlier in the half, flung his right arm back and caught the Irish winger in the face. The assistant referee signalled for a throw-in, prompting Kilbane to shove the Chelsea left-back to the ground. Winter dispersed the resulting ruck by dismissing the pair. </p> <p>\"The referee had no choice, but the sending-off actually unsettled our balance,\" said Reid, who watched Phillips do a tidy job at right-back. To complete the surreal scenario, Chelsea's full-back Albert Ferrer finished the game playing as a third striker. </p> <p>But the Spaniard's foray forward was indicative of his side's inability to make an attacking impression. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was substituted at half-time, and the incisive verve that yielded six goals in their previous Premiership games against Manchester United and Liverpool was non-existent. </p> <p>\"We would have liked to have created more to hurt Sunderland, but I was pleased with the spirit and I would like to compliment my players,\" said Ranieri, who thumped the roof of the dug-out in frustration near the end. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

I've played for England while I've been here and it would be daft of me to want to leave. We've showed we can mix it with the big boys.\" And mix it they did, although the 66th-minute fracas that left both sides a player short was probably not what Phillips had in mind. Graeme le Saux, who had been booked for a foul on Kevin Kilbane earlier in the half, flung his right arm back and caught the Irish winger in the face. The assistant referee signalled for a throw-in, prompting Kilbane to shove the Chelsea left-back to the ground. Winter dispersed the resulting ruck by dismissing the pair. \"The referee had no choice, but the sending-off actually unsettled our balance,\" said Reid, who watched Phillips do a tidy job at right-back. To complete the surreal scenario, Chelsea's full-back Albert Ferrer finished the game playing as a third striker. But the Spaniard's foray forward was indicative of his side's inability to make an attacking impression. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was substituted at half-time, and the incisive verve that yielded six goals in their previous Premiership games against Manchester United and Liverpool was non-existent. \"We would have liked to have created more to hurt Sunderland, but I was pleased with the spirit and I would like to compliment my players,\" said Ranieri, who thumped the roof of the dug-out in frustration near the end. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But who knows, with Halloween coming up there might just be a darker, more sinister motive at work. </p> <p>The injured Ferguson may be more talisman than match-winning striker, but how Everton miss him. It is widely believed that their fortunes will improve markedly once the light infantry currently deployed on the front line is replaced by the heavy artillery that lingers within the Goodison MASH unit. </p> <p>But the return of men like Ferguson, Richard Gough and Francis Jeffers may come too late to move Everton's season from hard shoulder to fast lane; the damage to aspira tions and morale may already be too severe. </p> <p>Their campaign - a fitful Premiership sequence and a pitiful Worthington Cup exit to Bristol Rovers - has been shot to pieces by the sort of buttock-clenchingly dumb blunders normally associated with schoolboy football. The manager Walter Smith has been criticised for asking key players to undertake unfamiliar duties, and he was at it again on Saturday, installing the Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen at centre-back. </p> <p>But given that a wretched game had appeared over once Jason Dodd's magnificent, thunderous volley edged Southampton in front with 14 minutes remaining, Smith all but got away with it this time. </p> <p>\"I thought we'd done enough because we never really looked like conceding,\" said the Southampton manager Glenn Hoddle. \"But one lapse of concentration cost us dear.\" </p> <p>That lapse came nine minutes from the end when Kevin Davies chose to wrestle Alex Nyarko to the ground as he shaped to steer in a shot. Michael Ball confidently swept home an uncontested penalty and Everton were saved. \"To come back and get a point was a bonus for us,\" Smith admitted, \"because neither side created much today.\" </p> <p>Smith will at least take solace in the performance of Paul Gascoigne, who was brought to Everton as a bit-part player but is now, in Ferguson's absence, very much the leading man. </p> <p>The pace has gone and with the weight loss so too has the strength, but Gascoigne ran himself stupid, chasing down both lost and good causes with outrageous enthusiasm. One can only hope his younger and fitter colleagues were suitably embarrassed at being upstaged by a man not deemed worthy of celebrity-mask status. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "For just \u00a34, those Everton supporters whose sense of taste is eclipsed by unswerving devotion to the cause can now buy a rather scary plastic mask that purports to resemble the finely chiselled features of Duncan Ferguson. The obvious conclusion is that these less than flattering replicas have been mass-produced to remind Merseysiders that the towering Scot is still at the club. But who knows, with Halloween coming up there might just be a darker, more sinister motive at work. The injured Ferguson may be more talisman than match-winning striker, but how Everton miss him. It is widely believed that their fortunes will improve markedly once the light infantry currently deployed on the front line is replaced by the heavy artillery that lingers within the Goodison MASH unit. But the return of men like Ferguson, Richard Gough and Francis Jeffers may come too late to move Everton's season from hard shoulder to fast lane; the damage to aspira tions and morale may already be too severe. Their campaign - a fitful Premiership sequence and a pitiful Worthington Cup exit to Bristol Rovers - has been shot to pieces by the sort of buttock-clenchingly dumb blunders normally associated with schoolboy football. The manager Walter Smith has been criticised for asking key players to undertake unfamiliar duties, and he was at it again on Saturday, installing the Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen at centre-back. But given that a wretched game had appeared over once Jason Dodd's magnificent, thunderous volley edged Southampton in front with 14 minutes remaining, Smith all but got away with it this time. \"I thought we'd done enough because we never really looked like conceding,\" said the Southampton manager Glenn Hoddle. \"But one lapse of concentration cost us dear.\" That lapse came nine minutes from the end when Kevin Davies chose to wrestle Alex Nyarko to the ground as he shaped to steer in a shot. Michael Ball confidently swept home an uncontested penalty and Everton were saved. \"To come back and get a point was a bonus for us,\" Smith admitted, \"because neither side created much today.\" Smith will at least take solace in the performance of Paul Gascoigne, who was brought to Everton as a bit-part player but is now, in Ferguson's absence, very much the leading man. The pace has gone and with the weight loss so too has the strength, but Gascoigne ran himself stupid, chasing down both lost and good causes with outrageous enthusiasm. One can only hope his younger and fitter colleagues were suitably embarrassed at being upstaged by a man not deemed worthy of celebrity-mask status. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The junior partners in the new coalition will take up two seats in the nine strong assembly cabinet in a reshuffle due to be announced by Labour first secretary Rhodri Morgan today. As part of the new arrangement the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, Mike German, will become deputy first secretary. Discussions on the division of cabinet portfolios were taking place between the party leaders last night. The coalition, modelled on the agreement between the two parties in Scotland, is due to remain in force until the next assembly elections in 2003. It was thrashed out in secret talks earlier this month in a bid to usher in a period of stable government in Cardiff following the turbulence that has marked the past 17 months of minority rule. The agreement, which triggered the resignation of the Labour education and culture secretary, Tom Middlehurst, in protest at the offer of cabinet seats to the Liberal Democrats, is founded on a partnership document that includes many of the policies on which the Lib Dems fought the 1999 assembly elections. Despite the initial disquiet of some Liberal Democrat members at the clandestine nature of the discussions, delegates to the party's autumn conference yesterday voted 130 to 11 in favour of the deal. Labour assembly members and the Labour executive in Wales had already given their approval. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, hailed the vote as a good day for Wales and for devolution. He said the assembly now had the stability it had lacked. \"Today's decision will increase confidence in the assembly and allow it to deliver changes - most of them in the Liberal Democrat manifesto - which will make a real difference to the lives of the people of Wales.\" Among the initiatives to have been agreed is the recruitment of 700 teachers to help reduce class sizes for eight to 11 year olds, the provision of an extra \u00a360m to support farmers and rural communities, and an immediate investigation into student hardship and funding. Agreement has also been reached on a review of voting systems for local government elections in Wales with a committment to pressing Westminster to bring forward assembly sponsored legislation to implement the review's conclusions.",

Its long, low brick classrooms were built around a large courtyard shaded by giant mango trees.</p> <p>Catholic and Protestant chapels stood just beyond the central courtyard, with dormitories, a refectory, an orchard, a vegetable garden, offices and teachers' houses spread out over a large area; it was the orderliness of Surrey transported to one of the wildest parts of the empire to forge a new elite on the British model.</p> <p>\"This school was the manufacturer of the first generation of politicians in the south. All the officers of Anyanya 1 [the group of insurgents that led the first southern rebellion, which started in 1955 before the British left] passed through this school,\" said one graduate and a former commander of the organisation into which Anyanya evolved, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (the SPLA).</p> <p>As the rebellion grew in the south in the 1960s, schools were closed and Rumbek secondary, with all its pupils and staff, was taken to the north. When peace was signed between north and south in 1972, the pupils organised the immediate return of the school.</p> <p>\"We came down all together by train, leaving the teachers to follow,\" said one of the move's organisers, later to become an SPLA commander.</p> <p>Once war broke out in the south in 1983 following the declaration of sharia Islamic law by Khartoum, the school's brief life as the cradle of the southern elite ended abruptly; its grounds became a government military barracks.</p> <p>The soldiers built a mosque, and pulled down the outlying buildings and the teachers' houses. The empty chapels now have Arabic slogans written on the walls. A broken-down military truck occupies a corner of the courtyard, where the odd bullet shines in the dust, and the laboratories have become the kitchen, housing two great vats of sorghum porridge and broth for cooking soup. Dozens of vultures perch on the roof.</p> <p>Three years ago the SPLA took Rumbek town and, as the town began to revive, the people reopened the secondary school. \"We had to, it is the identity of the south, the nucleus of our struggle,\" said one teacher.</p> <p>The reopening was a community effort, but there were few resources. Last year when the harvest was good, the townspeople contributed food. But this year southern Sudan faces another serious food deficit and the people have none to give. The students' food must be bought using some of the \u00a330 fee each pupil pays a year.</p> <p>How their families find the battered and torn Sudanese pound notes in this society, where life is mainly subsistence farming and barter and most adult males are dead or in the SPLA, is a mystery.</p> <p>In the classrooms, the students sit on home-made bamboo chairs, packed 80 or 100 to a room. There are now 380 students, in their late teens to late 20s. The school has only nine permanent teachers and 11 part-time ones.

      "bodyText": "Half a century ago, Rumbek secondary school was the only secondary school in southern Sudan, and it was the pride of British colonialism. Its long, low brick classrooms were built around a large courtyard shaded by giant mango trees. Catholic and Protestant chapels stood just beyond the central courtyard, with dormitories, a refectory, an orchard, a vegetable garden, offices and teachers' houses spread out over a large area; it was the orderliness of Surrey transported to one of the wildest parts of the empire to forge a new elite on the British model. \"This school was the manufacturer of the first generation of politicians in the south. All the officers of Anyanya 1 [the group of insurgents that led the first southern rebellion, which started in 1955 before the British left] passed through this school,\" said one graduate and a former commander of the organisation into which Anyanya evolved, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (the SPLA). As the rebellion grew in the south in the 1960s, schools were closed and Rumbek secondary, with all its pupils and staff, was taken to the north. When peace was signed between north and south in 1972, the pupils organised the immediate return of the school. \"We came down all together by train, leaving the teachers to follow,\" said one of the move's organisers, later to become an SPLA commander. Once war broke out in the south in 1983 following the declaration of sharia Islamic law by Khartoum, the school's brief life as the cradle of the southern elite ended abruptly; its grounds became a government military barracks. The soldiers built a mosque, and pulled down the outlying buildings and the teachers' houses. The empty chapels now have Arabic slogans written on the walls. A broken-down military truck occupies a corner of the courtyard, where the odd bullet shines in the dust, and the laboratories have become the kitchen, housing two great vats of sorghum porridge and broth for cooking soup. Dozens of vultures perch on the roof. Three years ago the SPLA took Rumbek town and, as the town began to revive, the people reopened the secondary school. \"We had to, it is the identity of the south, the nucleus of our struggle,\" said one teacher. The reopening was a community effort, but there were few resources. Last year when the harvest was good, the townspeople contributed food. But this year southern Sudan faces another serious food deficit and the people have none to give. The students' food must be bought using some of the \u00a330 fee each pupil pays a year. How their families find the battered and torn Sudanese pound notes in this society, where life is mainly subsistence farming and barter and most adult males are dead or in the SPLA, is a mystery. In the classrooms, the students sit on home-made bamboo chairs, packed 80 or 100 to a room. There are now 380 students, in their late teens to late 20s. The school has only nine permanent teachers and 11 part-time ones. Three of these were released from the military by the SPLA at the request of the headmaster. Most of them are graduates, but not trained teachers. None draws a salary, nor any equipment except for a very few books. The teachers' greatest frustration is not only the consistent lack of books, but the fact that the students are often completely unprepared. Although primary schools have been reopened in the liberated areas for several years, their standards are minimal. \"The children arrive here with no background. Their teachers are so poorly educated that it is often like starting from scratch with boys in their 20s,\" said one English literature teacher. He is teaching George Orwell's Animal Farm and Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, the books he was taught and loved himself a generation ago. But to his class, even much of the vocabulary is new. \"We have completely lost the battle for education,\" said one priest. \"Suppose peace comes, how can we even begin to negotiate with the northerners when they have degrees and we are coming from the village?\" The older generation were so well educated in this school that it hurts them deeply to know the next generation have lost out so dramatically. \"Before the war we had the British Council giving us scholarships and teachers,\" said one teacher. \"What's happened to you people that you do not bother now, when we are so much in need?\" Oxfam and Unicef have dug pit latrines, provided a grinding mill and some exercise books. The school's main donor looks like being the US Agency for International Development, which has promised $300,000 (\u00a3210,000) for teacher training and curriculum development; it has emphasised the importance of including girls. Endorsing this, one foreign aid official declared: \"We want many, many Margaret Thatchers, and many, many Indira Gandhis to come out of this school.\" There are now just three girls in the school, one of whom is 29 and a mother of three. The second, a tall determined-looking young woman who speaks English as impeccably as the first generation of Rumbek students, wants to be a doctor. She is following a tradition in the south: the first female graduate, the first female commissioned officer, and the first female doctor all came from Rumbek. \"But this was before the war spoiled everything,\" said one teacher bitterly. How the war destroys normal life 1955 First rebellion by southern Anyanya insurgents (an event known as Anyanya 1) 1956 Sudan becomes independent from Britain 1972 Addis Ababa peace agreement between north and south 1981 Anyanya 2 rebellion starts in south 1983 Khartoum proclaims Islamic sharia law 1983 Sudan People's Liberation Army/Anyanya merge 1980s SPLA takes large parts of south 1986 SPLA talks with northern opposition 1989 National Islamic Front military coup in Khartoum 1995 Asmara agreement brings northern opposition and SPLA together in National Democratic Alliance Sudan's long history of civil war means that: \u0095 Successive generations of children - more than 3m - have grown up without access to adequate primary education.

Without Paolo Maldini and Fernando Redondo, his team looks timid and uninspired. And there is no relief in sight. Next up for the beleaguered coach and his colourless rossoneri: Juventus at San Siro on Saturday night. The flu is going around Serie A at the moment and while Zaccheroni could blame the bug for removing Maldini from his defence, it could hardly explain the collective listlessness of his midfield. Bologna's much-travelled defender Giovanni Bia opened the scoring from close range after half an hour. Milan looked better for the introduction of Zvonimir Boban in the second half and Andriy Shevchenko headed an equaliser from Jose Mari's cross in the 62nd minute. Then Federico Giunti was sent off a quarter-hour from the end. Nevertheless, Milan looked as though they would earn a point, until Giovanni Piacenti scored with a 30-yard drive four minutes into injury time. Juventus, who beat Bari 2-0, and Roma, who romped to a 4-0 victory at Lecce, are now the only teams to have won both their games. Gabriel Batistuta scored his first two goals for Roma on Sunday - the 153rd and 154th of his Serie A career. Most have been scored with his right foot, but these were comparative rarities: a header and a left-foot drive. Francesco Totti completed the rout with a penalty in the final minute after Marco Delvecchio had been brought down. Juventus were without their first-choice strikers - Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi had both succumbed to the flu - but once again Darko Kovacevic proved to be an effective stand-in. The Yugoslav put Juve ahead in the second minute by bundling home a Zinedine Zidane cross at the near post. Zidane completed the scoring from the penalty spot in the final minute after Antonio Conte was brought down by Giuseppe Mazzarelli. Fiorentina, on four points, earned a place in the chasing group with two goals in the final four minutes on Sunday that earned them a 2-1 win over Reggina. Reggina, who beat Inter Milan on the opening day of the season, looked set for another upset after Massimo Marazzina gave them the lead with a diving header in the 68th minute. But Nuno Gomes, Fiorentina's Portuguese international striker, equalised in the 86th minute, volleying home an Enrico Chiesa cross, and Brazilian Leandro completed the comeback, heading home a Rui Costa corner in the final minute.",

The move comes a month before a conference, called by the church itself, to review how it deals with multiracial issues and may cause concern to bishops still reeling from child abuse convictions among the clergy. The association told the Guardian it will be pressing for an independent inquiry within the church similar to one recently appointed under Lord Nolan to review its procedures for dealing with accusations of paedophilia. Stephen Corriette, the association's director, claims that there are fewer than 30 black parish priests out of more than 5,600 in the 22 dioceses of England and Wales, just six of them British-born, and that Catholics from ethnic-minority communities are being frozen out of positions of responsibility in parishes. The church itself acknowledged last week that the figures were \"probably correct\" and admitted that its most recent statistics for priests in training showed just 16 black priests being ordained and a further 21 in seminaries. Roman Catholicism in Britain is perceived as the most white of the major denominations - the majority of British immigrants have not come from Catholic countries - though the association estimates that 12% of its communicants are from ethnic minority backgrounds. At a service at Westminster Cathedral, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the restoration of Catholic bishops to Britain, earlier this year, none of the 300 priests in attendance was black nor any of the altar servers or choir boys. Mr Corriette, born in Britain of Caribbean parents, said: \"It is ironic that the Catholic church calls itself universal when it is driving black people away by its attitudes.\" Mr Corriette has compiled a dossier of racist incidents.

The atmosphere this afternoon remained tense as clashes continued in the Middle East, while the two leaders, who have yet to meet bilaterally, gathered in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. At the beginning of the summit, Mr Clinton declared: \"We cannot afford to fail.\" The sombre-faced leaders posed silently for photographs and Mr Clinton ignored a reporter's question about prospects for the meeting before making his opening statement. \"The future of the peace process and the stability of the region are at stake,\" Mr Clinton said, urging both sides to remember how far they had come since 1993 when they agreed to resume the peace process. The summit was called to end the recent mayhem on the West Bank and Gaza that has cost nearly 100 lives and fractured whatever trust remained between Israel and the Palestinians. On a key issue, Mr Clinton called for a fact-finding mission to probe the causes of the most serious fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians in years and to prevent a recurrence. \"We want to get negotiations started again,\" he said. The Egyptian president and host of the summit, Hosni Mubarak, called for \"saving what is left of the credibility of the peace process\". After Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak made opening remarks, the meeting took a recess. Each country's team kept to itself. Mr Barak stood up and talked to his advisers. Mr Clinton turned in his chair to speak to the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. The leaders sat about 10 feet apart around a horseshoe table, with Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak sitting at the head of the table. Meanwhile, Palestinian militiamen opened fire on Israeli soldiers during two West Bank protest marches, and rock-throwing clashes erupted elsewhere in the Palestinian territories. Two Palestinians were seriously injured by Israeli fire, Palestinian doctors said. South of the West Bank town of Nablus, around 1,500 Palestinians marched toward an Israeli army checkpoint. Around 500 broke away from the march and began throwing stones at three Israeli army jeeps. Several gunmen, shooting from olive groves, fired on Israeli soldiers, drawing return fire. Eight Palestinians were injured in total, including the two who were in a serious condition with bullets to the head and chest respectively, said a doctor at a Palestinian field clinic. On the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint. Across the West Bank and Gaza strip, thousands of Palestinians joined protests against a renewal of contacts with Israel. With a little more than three months left in his presidency, Mr Clinton still hopes to broker a peace accord. But for this summit, the most optimistic outlook is for a truce and a date set for new negotiations between the two sides. \"We shouldn't give it all up for what has happened in the last few weeks,\" he said. Mr Barak was first to arrive for the emergency summit at the Egyptian Red Sea spa report, followed by Mr Clinton and Mr Arafat. Also at the emergency summit were King Abdullah of Jordan, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and Javier Solana, the EU security chief. Mr Arafat, Mr Barak and Mr Clinton each met separately with Mr Mubarak before the summit gathering. Mr Clinton hopes to return home in time for a memorial service on Wednesday in Norfolk, Virginia, to honour the 17 US sailors killed in an attack last Thursday on a US destroyer at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.",

A minute later - with Westerveld still undecided - all hell broke loose. Three masked men burst into the bar and opened fire, wounding one man in the leg and another in the foot as the Liverpool keeper and five of his team-mates looked on in horror.</p> <p>Fortunately, none of the players were injured and they were later driven away in a mini-bus. A statement released by Liverpool FC this morning said: \"A number of players were enjoying dinner with their wives on Sunday evening at a restaurant they have previously visited a number of times when the shooting occurred. Markus Babbel, Didi Hamann, Sami Hyypia, Erik Meijer, Sander Westerveld and Christian Ziege all provided their details to the police before leaving the premises. The group were obviously shocked by events but were thankfully all unhurt.\" </p> <p>The two casualties were treated in hospital for their injuries, which are thankfully not too serious. The gunmen, who wore balaclavas, escaped in a silver Vauxhall car, which was later found burned out in nearby Greenbank Road. Police are asking anyone with any information to contact them.</p> <p>Westerveld makes no mention of the shooting in his consistently entertaining website column today. \"Personally, I like to think I am on something of a winning streak at the moment,\" he says, blissfully ignorant of the fact that he could have been killed. \"Before we played Derby I managed to win at golf on my computer! I always enjoy winning.

      "bodyText": "GUNS, GOLF AND GREAT GAMES At 10.29pm last night, Sander Westerveld was in Liverpool's trendy Jalons Wine Bar, debating whether to stay rooted to his seat or make a dash for the toilet. A minute later - with Westerveld still undecided - all hell broke loose. Three masked men burst into the bar and opened fire, wounding one man in the leg and another in the foot as the Liverpool keeper and five of his team-mates looked on in horror. Fortunately, none of the players were injured and they were later driven away in a mini-bus. A statement released by Liverpool FC this morning said: \"A number of players were enjoying dinner with their wives on Sunday evening at a restaurant they have previously visited a number of times when the shooting occurred. Markus Babbel, Didi Hamann, Sami Hyypia, Erik Meijer, Sander Westerveld and Christian Ziege all provided their details to the police before leaving the premises. The group were obviously shocked by events but were thankfully all unhurt.\" The two casualties were treated in hospital for their injuries, which are thankfully not too serious. The gunmen, who wore balaclavas, escaped in a silver Vauxhall car, which was later found burned out in nearby Greenbank Road. Police are asking anyone with any information to contact them. Westerveld makes no mention of the shooting in his consistently entertaining website column today. \"Personally, I like to think I am on something of a winning streak at the moment,\" he says, blissfully ignorant of the fact that he could have been killed. \"Before we played Derby I managed to win at golf on my computer! I always enjoy winning. Long may it continue!\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * ADVERTISEMENT Free personal reminders, news, sports, weather, horoscopes and lottery results sent direct to your Vodafone by text; register now with www.vizzavi.co.uk and keep informed anywhere. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WEAH WALKS Yesterday, George Weah failed to turn up as a guest on Granada Television's flagship football programme Soccer Sunday.

      "body": "<p>My arrival is accompanied by a waiter bearing a large bloody mary. Gracious as his greetings are, I get the feeling Adam Garcia is more pleased to see the drink. Last night was the UK premiere of Coyote Ugly. \"I had a bit of a heavy night. 30 of my friends were there at the aftershow party,\" he tells me. \"Oooh, and there were almost five people shouting out my name.\" But despite his insistence that he's far from a megastar, the big times can't be far off for this 27-year-old Australian actor. </p> <p>Already a veteran of the British stage, Coyote Ugly is Adam Garcia's first Hollywood film, after a bit part in 1997's Wilde and the lead in Australian tap-dancing movie Bootmen (due for UK release next year). But a career in Hollywood seems all but assured: he's already working on Riding in Cars with Boys with Drew Barrymore (I play an \"orbital character with a relationship to Drew Barrymore\" was all he would reveal). </p> <p>And his performance as the cheeky dishwasher who wins the heroine's heart makes him one of the most watchable elements in Coyote Ugly, a New York-based contemporary fairytale about the bar-top dancing antics of a wannabe songwriter and her not-unattractive colleagues.</p> <p>The film's tagline proudly announces \"Tonight they're calling the shots\", but the reality is a little more ambivalent; the movie tries to have its cake and eat it. While it features nubile young women indulging in little short of lapdancing to a roomful of male punters and the heroine gives up her job because her daddy and her boyfriend disapprove, it also tries to preach a feminist message of empowerment and strength - these women are tough and use their sexuality for their own enjoyment, and - hey - this is the 21st century - wear tight clothes and dance on the bar because they want to.</p> <p>Garcia acknowledges that there are double-edged swords in the film - how far do these sort of bars exploit or empower women? \"It's a difficult one because obviously it's a Hollywood film and they need to drive it with sex, and sex sells everything, let's face it. But I think we have to face the realities, that women's sexuality is a lot of their power, and to deny that would be stupid, and men are slobbering idiots around women.\"</p> <p>However, matters are turned nicely on their heads by Garcia's character Kevin O'Donnell, who, in one scene, is \"sold\" in a slave auction to the hysterical female with the most readies, gets to dance on the bar, and - get this - he really is topless. So it's OK for men to be sex objects then? \"Yeah , they abused me,\" said Adam, with a wicked grin. \"I'm a tart. I'm a dancer. Most dancers are tarts anyway.\" </p> <p>So how did this Australian dancer, who's lived in London for the past six years, and played Tony Manero in the stage version of Saturday Night Fever, end up in a Jerry Bruckheimer production? \"I don't know why they cast me,\" he shrugs, \"I never asked.\" He was cast on the strength of an audition tape only; producer Bruckheimer didn't even realise that his star was a trained dancer. The enormously entertaining scene of his impromptu bar routine was unscripted. </p> <p>\"Throughout filming, I kept on being annoying and tap dancing, because they gave me really nice hard-soled shoes, and it was a concrete floor, and then someone said 'I saw him in Saturday Night Fever - he's a dancer'.\" So the dancing element was added as an afterthought. It's a shame we don't have more, I ventured. Adam couldn't possibly comment, but he did admit that it was only him and actress Izabella Miko who did all their own dancing.</p> <p>So what attracted him to the project? Simple - \"One, it was going to be a good amount of cash, and two, I really did like the story. It really is sweet I liked this character because he's genuinely nice, an affectionate and genuine person - altruistic to the point he doesn't care about himself.\" </p> <p>Garcia displays similar insouciance when pressed for the reason for his recent success. He seems have riden on the back of a wider recent trend in the film industry though. This has, after all, been Australia's year in film. While Russell Crowe is still wowing worldwide audiences in Gladiator, fellow Ozzies Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman, Cate Blanchett and Guy Pearce, to name but a few, are winning critical and commercial acclaim. </p> <p>So, does he have a theory behind this sudden antipodean invasion of our screens? \"I've been asked this a lot\" says Garcia. \"It's because we're cool.\" But seriously, he points out that many of these \"new\" actors have in fact been around for ages, but the recent explosion of technology has made films everywhere more accessible. </p> <p>\"Hollywood producers are suddenly realising, 'Oh my God [other nationalities] are not idiots, they're talented, bless them'.\" But he's still touchingly modest about his career: \"It's literally luck. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. I am ambitious, I guess, in that when I do a job I'm very focused, but I've never had any real plan about what to do.\" </p> <p>I ask him about the \"new Travolta\" tag. Not only did he play a part forever associated with Travolta in the London stage play Saturday Night Fever, but he shares the former's dark good looks and cute dimpled chin. It's inevitable, he says, but \"I'm happy to take it because I believe he's a wonderful actor\". </p> <p>Unlike Garcia, Travolta is purely an actor by trade, who happened to be a great dancer. \"I've been dancing for 20 years... I'm not the best dancer in the world, but I love it. It's how I express myself, and has been for many years of my life. As for acting, I'm still learning.\" So would he call himself an actor or a dancer? He corrects me. Dancers are in fact actors. \"We're the plebian cast of the entertainment hierarchy we're the lowest paid, we have no union.\" </p> <p>Such worries and frustrations must be fast receding. At the moment he's spoilt for choice. \"I want to carry on doing theatre and movies and dancing I want to be doing everything.\" And what about the future - where does he see himself in 25 years time?</p> <p>\"I'd like to be making a movie every two years for an incomparable amount of money, being like a Brando-esque living on an island with my 40 children. That would rule.\" </p> <p>He crunches a celery stick and grins at me. Flights of fantasy aside, I would safely predict that there will be more than five people screaming his name at his next premiere.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Geoffrey Robinson's long-awaited attack on Peter Mandelson for \"lying\" over the circumstances of his \u00a3373,000 home loan turned into a political damp squib early today when an account given in the former paymaster general's memoirs proved to be only slightly different from Mr Mandelson's own version. Despite extensive pre-publicity and predictions that the Northern Ireland secretary would be forced to resign for a second time from Tony Blair's cabinet, the supposedly \"explosive\" serialisation of Mr Robinson's book in today's Daily Mail gave Downing Street hope that it will prove a one-day wonder. Last night the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, David Heathcoat-Amory, demanded a fresh Commons investigation. But the Tories had earlier shot their own fox by rashly reissuing a detailed eight-page critique of Mr Robinson's chequered business record that will make it much harder to say his version should be preferred. In any case, the discrepancies appear to be those of tone and detail only, which may also help justify David Blunkett's pre-publication complaint yesterday that the former Treasury minister - whom even Gordon Brown had asked not to write An Unconventional Minister - is engaged in self-important point-scoring. In today's extract, Mr Robinson describes how the two men, then friends, met for dinner at the millionaire businessman's Park Lane flat in May 1996. \"He was looking for a loan. He initiated the discussion of his financial circumstances and of his flat. He told me how miserable he felt there. What I heard from Peter was a cri de coeur,\" he writes. After hearing Mr Mandelson say he how had set his heart on living in fashionably expensive Notting Hill and that he had no one to help him Mr Robinson admits: \"At this point I said financially I was in a good position and that I might be able to assist if he wanted me to.\" Though some details are at odds with what Mr Mandelson told Donald Macintyre in his biography and what he told the Commons standards watchdog, Elizabeth Filkin, after the secret loan was revealed in the Guardian in 1998, the main thrust is clearly the same: that Mr Mandelson raised his home-hunting problems, but that Mr Robinson, a famously generous colleague, made the initial offer. Mr Robinson, who quit the government with Mr Mandelson in December 1998, but did not - unlike the old friend he now regards as an enemy - return to office 10 months later, also repeats well-aired complaints about Mr Mandelson as a \"divisive and destabilising\" figure in the Blair inner circle - the view of Gordon Brown's allies which is reciprocated. Tony Blair has often blamed both sides. Mr Robinson's former colleague Mr Blunkett, the education secretary, used a BBC1 interview to slap him down. \"My view is that those who have benefited a great deal from politics, or are in a position because of their wealth to be able to enjoy a comfortable life whatever happens, need to bear in mind the people in constituencies like mine who rely on a Labour government to have a job, to have a decent education, to have a health service to be proud of, and then reflect on what self-indulgence means for those people we represent,\" he said on Breakfast with Frost. Ministers and officials who have suffered a series of autumn embarrassments from political books this year endorsed Mr Blunkett's view that the millionaire businessman's book was irrelevant to most voters. One aide to Gordon Brown called it \"ancient history\" and another minister called it \"Geoffrey's revenge\". The book may not prove to have any lasting political damage given two weekend opinion polls.

He toured Bangladesh and New Zealand with England A last year and has just been named one of the standbys for this winter's England A tour of West Indies.</em> </p> <p>\"Being on standby for the A tour is a bit of a bonus. Last year they announced the standbys a couple of days after the main squad, so when I didn't hear anything for a while [they announced the main squads in September] I had visions of a long winter lay-off.</p> <p>\"I've had to make some slight changes to my plans: I'll have to keep some sort of form and fitness now. Up until a couple of weeks ago I'd thought of going away in January and February to Zimbabwe, but now I won't obviously. It's not frustrating though - certainly better than not being on standby. I was on standby last year and managed to get the call-up. There are four of us in reserve this time; hopefully I might be the lucky one.</p> <p>\"I'm in the middle of moving house at the moment. I'm staying in Eastbourne but going to a nicer part of town. I've got to buy some furniture, and make an effort to learn a little bit about DIY and wallpaper. I did a little bit in my old place but didn't really know what I was doing - just slapped on a bit of paint to make it look different. This is a longer-term thing. It's got three bedrooms and a little box room. When my brother comes back from university he'll live in one of them. </p> <p>\"I'm rushing around with solicitors' letters trying to exchange contracts at the moment before I go on holiday. We fly out to Cape Town on Tuesday [tomorrow] for three or four days of parties and beaches and stuff - all the things you can't do when you have to worry about cricket - and then go on to Namibia. I'm going with a few friends - it's the first time I've had a decent, proper holiday for ages and it's going to be pure pleasure.</p> <p>\"I've spent the last two winters coaching in Namibia, and I want to do all the things like going on safari which you have no chance to do if you actually live over there. The Namibian national team plays in the South African 2nd XI competition. They are allowed to play an overseas player so I had some games too. They play about five three-day games over six months, so you just do enough to keep your fitness up. </p> <p>\"I'm doing bits of coaching at Eastbourne College (a public school in Sussex). I did a little bit last year which I really enjoyed, but I tend to enjoy coaching the more talented players. It sounds really awful but I get frustrated with the others, but it isn't a bad lesson for me to work with the less talented kids.</p> <p>\"I've been away for the last two winters so I didn't really see that much of my team-mates. We made the big promises at the end of the season but I'm not sure whether it will happen. People like Mark Robinson and Tony Cottey go off to Yorkshire and Glamorgan so the chance of seeing them is pretty remote. We all live in each other's pockets during the season so it is quite nice to get away from it all.</p> <p>\"I'll be following what England get up to quite avidly - I kept an eye on what went on in Kenya. I might try and do a computer course too if I can, there are a world of opportunities once you know what you're doing with them.\" </p> <p><em>James Kirtley was talking to Tanya Aldred</em></p> <p><strong>Previous My Winter columns</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,379626,00.html\"><strong> Peter Such</strong></a>, the Essex and England offspinner who is preparing for his benefit year<br> <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,376261,00.html\"> <strong>Mark Wagh</strong></a>, the Warwickshire batsman who went to Venice<br><a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,373110,00.html\"> <strong>Reg May</strong></a>, the ex-meteorologist who now scores for Cambridge</p>",

      "bodyText": "James Kirtley, 25 is a right-arm seamer. He has played six seasons at Sussex and topped their first-class bowling averages in 2000 with 63 wickets at 24.75. He toured Bangladesh and New Zealand with England A last year and has just been named one of the standbys for this winter's England A tour of West Indies. \"Being on standby for the A tour is a bit of a bonus. Last year they announced the standbys a couple of days after the main squad, so when I didn't hear anything for a while [they announced the main squads in September] I had visions of a long winter lay-off. \"I've had to make some slight changes to my plans: I'll have to keep some sort of form and fitness now. Up until a couple of weeks ago I'd thought of going away in January and February to Zimbabwe, but now I won't obviously. It's not frustrating though - certainly better than not being on standby. I was on standby last year and managed to get the call-up. There are four of us in reserve this time; hopefully I might be the lucky one. \"I'm in the middle of moving house at the moment. I'm staying in Eastbourne but going to a nicer part of town. I've got to buy some furniture, and make an effort to learn a little bit about DIY and wallpaper. I did a little bit in my old place but didn't really know what I was doing - just slapped on a bit of paint to make it look different. This is a longer-term thing. It's got three bedrooms and a little box room. When my brother comes back from university he'll live in one of them. \"I'm rushing around with solicitors' letters trying to exchange contracts at the moment before I go on holiday. We fly out to Cape Town on Tuesday [tomorrow] for three or four days of parties and beaches and stuff - all the things you can't do when you have to worry about cricket - and then go on to Namibia. I'm going with a few friends - it's the first time I've had a decent, proper holiday for ages and it's going to be pure pleasure. \"I've spent the last two winters coaching in Namibia, and I want to do all the things like going on safari which you have no chance to do if you actually live over there. The Namibian national team plays in the South African 2nd XI competition. They are allowed to play an overseas player so I had some games too. They play about five three-day games over six months, so you just do enough to keep your fitness up. \"I'm doing bits of coaching at Eastbourne College (a public school in Sussex). I did a little bit last year which I really enjoyed, but I tend to enjoy coaching the more talented players. It sounds really awful but I get frustrated with the others, but it isn't a bad lesson for me to work with the less talented kids. \"I've been away for the last two winters so I didn't really see that much of my team-mates. We made the big promises at the end of the season but I'm not sure whether it will happen. People like Mark Robinson and Tony Cottey go off to Yorkshire and Glamorgan so the chance of seeing them is pretty remote. We all live in each other's pockets during the season so it is quite nice to get away from it all. \"I'll be following what England get up to quite avidly - I kept an eye on what went on in Kenya. I might try and do a computer course too if I can, there are a world of opportunities once you know what you're doing with them.\" James Kirtley was talking to Tanya Aldred Previous My Winter columns Peter Such, the Essex and England offspinner who is preparing for his benefit year Mark Wagh, the Warwickshire batsman who went to Venice Reg May, the ex-meteorologist who now scores for Cambridge",

      "body": "<p>Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, yesterday agreed to sell its 23% holding in BSkyB as a means of gaining approval for its \u00a366bn merger with Canada's Seagram. </p> <p>The European commission set three conditions as it gave approval to the creation of what will be called Vivendi Universal. It has already been cleared in the US. </p> <p>The business will span mobile phone networks, the Universal Hollywood studios, Universal Music, internet portals and pay television in Europe. The deal had been hailed in June as the first European media group which could meet rivals in the US eye to eye. </p> <p>The agreement to divest the BSkyB shares ends what has on occasion been an uncomfortable relationship between Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls the company, and Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. </p> <p>The divestment, which was announced yesterday morning, had little effect on the BSkyB share price, which closed up 7p at 907p. The sale could also mean that Vivendi will no longer become a significant shareholder in Sky Global Networks, the holding company for all of Mr Murdoch's satellite pay-television businesses which is due for a stock market flotation later this year. </p> <p>Mr Messier hinted that he could still play a part in the new SGN company, however, and said: \"All doors remain open\". BSkyB's link to the Fox film studios through News Corp was the EC's main cause for concern. Vivendi has two years to sell its stake. \"We will take our time and examine together with Rupert Murdoch the best way to exit from BSkyB for both us and News Corp,\" Mr Messier said. </p> <p>The divestment, he added, would be made with a view to maintaining \"the excellent quality\" of their relationship. </p> <p>Under the second EC stipulation, Vivendi must offer to rival pay-TV operators access to Universal's film output . It has guaranteed that its own pay-TV operation, Canal+, will not hold first rights to more than 50% of Universal's film production. </p> <p>The Canal+ commitment covers the French, Belgian, Italian, Dutch, Spanish and Nordic countries over a five-year period. The third issue was Vivendi's multi-access internet portal, Vizzavi, which caused competitive concerns over the emerging online music market. To answer that worry, Vivendi will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content, also for five years. </p> <p>Last year Mr Messier attempted to broker a merger between Canal+ and BSkyB but the talks ended in acrimony over which side would emerge in control of the combined operation. Mr Messier then rattled Mr Murdoch by building a stake of 25% in BSkyB, which has since been diluted by new shares being issued. Relations between the two men though are said to have warmed. </p> <p>A BSkyB spokesman said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. We now intend to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake.\" </p> <p>The deal cements Mr Messier's position as one of the most powerful media figures worldwide. Since he took the helm of what was then G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-des-Eaux in 1996, Mr Messier has reshaped the utility as a media and communications business. </p> <p>Seagram's Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and includes artists Boyzone, Elton John and Shania Twain, while its film business has scored hits with The Mummy and Gladiator. </p> <p>Its television arm produces shows including Xena Warrior Princess and has a library of programmes such as Kojak, Murder She Wrote and Miami Vice providing a wealth of content for Vivendi's pay-TV networks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, yesterday agreed to sell its 23% holding in BSkyB as a means of gaining approval for its \u00a366bn merger with Canada's Seagram. The European commission set three conditions as it gave approval to the creation of what will be called Vivendi Universal. It has already been cleared in the US. The business will span mobile phone networks, the Universal Hollywood studios, Universal Music, internet portals and pay television in Europe. The deal had been hailed in June as the first European media group which could meet rivals in the US eye to eye. The agreement to divest the BSkyB shares ends what has on occasion been an uncomfortable relationship between Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls the company, and Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. The divestment, which was announced yesterday morning, had little effect on the BSkyB share price, which closed up 7p at 907p. The sale could also mean that Vivendi will no longer become a significant shareholder in Sky Global Networks, the holding company for all of Mr Murdoch's satellite pay-television businesses which is due for a stock market flotation later this year. Mr Messier hinted that he could still play a part in the new SGN company, however, and said: \"All doors remain open\". BSkyB's link to the Fox film studios through News Corp was the EC's main cause for concern. Vivendi has two years to sell its stake. \"We will take our time and examine together with Rupert Murdoch the best way to exit from BSkyB for both us and News Corp,\" Mr Messier said. The divestment, he added, would be made with a view to maintaining \"the excellent quality\" of their relationship. Under the second EC stipulation, Vivendi must offer to rival pay-TV operators access to Universal's film output . It has guaranteed that its own pay-TV operation, Canal+, will not hold first rights to more than 50% of Universal's film production. The Canal+ commitment covers the French, Belgian, Italian, Dutch, Spanish and Nordic countries over a five-year period. The third issue was Vivendi's multi-access internet portal, Vizzavi, which caused competitive concerns over the emerging online music market. To answer that worry, Vivendi will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content, also for five years. Last year Mr Messier attempted to broker a merger between Canal+ and BSkyB but the talks ended in acrimony over which side would emerge in control of the combined operation. Mr Messier then rattled Mr Murdoch by building a stake of 25% in BSkyB, which has since been diluted by new shares being issued. Relations between the two men though are said to have warmed. A BSkyB spokesman said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. We now intend to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake.\" The deal cements Mr Messier's position as one of the most powerful media figures worldwide. Since he took the helm of what was then G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-des-Eaux in 1996, Mr Messier has reshaped the utility as a media and communications business. Seagram's Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and includes artists Boyzone, Elton John and Shania Twain, while its film business has scored hits with The Mummy and Gladiator. Its television arm produces shows including Xena Warrior Princess and has a library of programmes such as Kojak, Murder She Wrote and Miami Vice providing a wealth of content for Vivendi's pay-TV networks.",

Everybody and the polls agreed the day after the first debate that Gore won easily. Then three things conspired to change the result, manifest in a sharp rise in the polls for Bush. First, instant replay. When it came to anything other than a vacuous generalisation in that first debate, Bush was open mouthed like a fish gasping for air. The trouble was Gore showed his contempt by rolling his eyes and shaking his head. In the week following, television replayed this image without illustrating the provocation. \"Where were the man's manners?\" became a staple of conversation, instead of focusing the question on Bush: \"Where was the man's mind?\"</p> <p>Next, the Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman encounter. The press and the Democrats had written off Cheney, but he scored big time. His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences.</p> <p>And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar.</p> <p>Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late.</p> <p>And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point.</p> <p>The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism.</p> <p>The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much.</p> <p>Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences. And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar. Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late. And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point. The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism. The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much. Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners? comment@theguardian.com",

He was not especially prolific, writing some 120 stories (a third of them in the period 1964-67), which were gathered into nine collections; four of his nine novels were actually mosaics of interlinked novellas. Nor was he easy to categorise. His first novel, The Furies, was a failed attempt to produce a catastrophe novel in the vein of John Wyndham or John Christopher.</p> <p>His next, Pavane, was a virtuoso work, in which Elizabeth I was assassinated in 1588 and the reformation and industrial revolution never took place; by 1968, the Catholic church had held power for 400 years, suppressing all technological development as heresy. This was Roberts's first mosaic novel, each part of the story told from a different viewpoint but building a picture of a world extraordinarily different to our own. Much of it is set in a beautiful southern England, where hauliers ply the roads in steam-driven locomotives and giant semaphore stations dominate the countryside.</p> <p>He wrote evocatively of these strange times, as a challenge to the rigidity of the church begins to grow, awaiting the spark of an invention to begin the process of revolution.</p> <p>Roberts's later novels were no less challenging: The Inner Wheel dealt with gestalt minds and an encroaching world war, The Boat Of Fate was a historical novel of Roman Britain, and The Chalk Giants saw struggling loser Stanley Potts try to escape visions of post-nuclear cataclysm, which all, in some form, feature Martine, the girl he loves.</p> <p>Girls played a large part in Roberts's stories, from his earliest humorous tales about a young witch named Anita to the adventures of Kaeti, whose slightly skewed England is also the home of vampires, ghosts and other odd denizens.</p> <p>In Molly Zero, his heroine Molly rebels against the bureaucratically complex future England, and in Gr\u00e1inne, the narrator, writer and adman Alistair Bevan (a pen-name used by Roberts in some of his early stories), finds his fate entwined with that of the girl-goddess of the title.</p> <p>Roberts himself seemed unable to form steady relationships, professional or personal. Unmarried, and living alone in a rented flat, for years he refused to deal with major publishers, accusing them of creative accounting over the royalties of his early books. Even when he dealt with small-press publishers, the relationship would often sour, their quality not helped by Roberts's sudden mood swings and self-destructive tendencies.</p> <p>He could be withdrawn and uncommunicative, yet on other occasions would be a good companion. He remained close-lipped about his private life, and even the autobiographical Lemady is an idiosyncratic mixture of fact and fantasy as he draws sketches from his life, focusing largely on his arguments with publishers, and interacts with the fictional woman of the title.</p> <p>Roberts was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and studied for his national diploma in design at Northampton School of Art, later attending Leicester College of Art. He worked in advertising and illustration before selling his first story. He was closely associated with the magazines Science Fantasy and New Worlds, drawing covers and contributing stories to both. When Science Fantasy changed its name to Impulse, he became associate editor and then managing editor. As an illustrator, he later produced covers for books by Philip K Dick and John Brunner, two other science-fiction writers who struggled to find their proper place in literature.</p> <p>A new short novel, Drek Yarman, was serialised in the magazine Spectrum SF earlier this year, and Roberts had recently signed a deal with Wildside Press, which would have brought much of his work back into print, perhaps to wider recognition. Unfortunately, only three titles had appeared by the time he died, of complications arising after he had been hospitalised for a chest infection.</p> <p>Keith John Kingston Roberts, writer, born September 20 1935; died October 5 2000</p>",

This was Roberts's first mosaic novel, each part of the story told from a different viewpoint but building a picture of a world extraordinarily different to our own. Much of it is set in a beautiful southern England, where hauliers ply the roads in steam-driven locomotives and giant semaphore stations dominate the countryside. He wrote evocatively of these strange times, as a challenge to the rigidity of the church begins to grow, awaiting the spark of an invention to begin the process of revolution. Roberts's later novels were no less challenging: The Inner Wheel dealt with gestalt minds and an encroaching world war, The Boat Of Fate was a historical novel of Roman Britain, and The Chalk Giants saw struggling loser Stanley Potts try to escape visions of post-nuclear cataclysm, which all, in some form, feature Martine, the girl he loves. Girls played a large part in Roberts's stories, from his earliest humorous tales about a young witch named Anita to the adventures of Kaeti, whose slightly skewed England is also the home of vampires, ghosts and other odd denizens. In Molly Zero, his heroine Molly rebels against the bureaucratically complex future England, and in Gr\u00e1inne, the narrator, writer and adman Alistair Bevan (a pen-name used by Roberts in some of his early stories), finds his fate entwined with that of the girl-goddess of the title. Roberts himself seemed unable to form steady relationships, professional or personal. Unmarried, and living alone in a rented flat, for years he refused to deal with major publishers, accusing them of creative accounting over the royalties of his early books. Even when he dealt with small-press publishers, the relationship would often sour, their quality not helped by Roberts's sudden mood swings and self-destructive tendencies. He could be withdrawn and uncommunicative, yet on other occasions would be a good companion. He remained close-lipped about his private life, and even the autobiographical Lemady is an idiosyncratic mixture of fact and fantasy as he draws sketches from his life, focusing largely on his arguments with publishers, and interacts with the fictional woman of the title. Roberts was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and studied for his national diploma in design at Northampton School of Art, later attending Leicester College of Art. He worked in advertising and illustration before selling his first story. He was closely associated with the magazines Science Fantasy and New Worlds, drawing covers and contributing stories to both. When Science Fantasy changed its name to Impulse, he became associate editor and then managing editor. As an illustrator, he later produced covers for books by Philip K Dick and John Brunner, two other science-fiction writers who struggled to find their proper place in literature. A new short novel, Drek Yarman, was serialised in the magazine Spectrum SF earlier this year, and Roberts had recently signed a deal with Wildside Press, which would have brought much of his work back into print, perhaps to wider recognition. Unfortunately, only three titles had appeared by the time he died, of complications arising after he had been hospitalised for a chest infection. Keith John Kingston Roberts, writer, born September 20 1935; died October 5 2000",

In Israel such bluntness is considered a virtue. In the Arab world it is deeply offensive. The blue paper was already smouldering when Ariel Sharon, the leader of the Israeli rightwing opposition Likud party, paid his notorious visit to the Haram al-Sharif complex, surrounded by hundreds of Israeli troops.

Specifically, and unprecedentedly, he will have to use some very plain language to explain to the Israelis that they can no longer rule three million Arab subjects by brute force.</p> <p>Time is not only short; it has run out. The chances are that if this summit fails, Arafat will finally do what he has always threatened, and unilaterally declare Palestine a free and sovereign state.

At Camp David in the summer Israel and the Palestinians came tantalisingly close to a final settlement, making startling progress on some of the knottier issues, including refugees and final boundaries. On Jerusalem, the greatest sticking point of all, Barak played his boldest card, offering Arafat a share of the city and guaranteeing the autonomy of the Muslim holy places. That wasn't nearly enough to satisfy the Palestinian president, who wants the Old City and the eastern, Arab, suburbs. At Camp David, Barak in effect told Arafat to take it or leave it. In Israel such bluntness is considered a virtue. In the Arab world it is deeply offensive. The blue paper was already smouldering when Ariel Sharon, the leader of the Israeli rightwing opposition Likud party, paid his notorious visit to the Haram al-Sharif complex, surrounded by hundreds of Israeli troops. That was the spark which ignited the powder-keg. The best hope of the outside world now is that President Clinton retains his fiercely held ambition to broker a lasting peace in the Middle East. He has just three months left to achieve his goal before his term in office ends. The US president will need all his charm and powers of persuasion to heave the peace train back on to the rails. Specifically, and unprecedentedly, he will have to use some very plain language to explain to the Israelis that they can no longer rule three million Arab subjects by brute force. Time is not only short; it has run out. The chances are that if this summit fails, Arafat will finally do what he has always threatened, and unilaterally declare Palestine a free and sovereign state. And that will be the day that war truly breaks out. Useful links Special report: Israel and the Middle East Government of Israel Palestinian National Authority",

      "body": "<p>Here is a prediction about tonight's BBC news at 10pm. It will be better than last Friday's news at 9pm. Not because the tenor of the news itself will necessarily have changed - it will probably be pretty dire as usual - but because the extra hour counts. Time (attention Chris Smith) matters. </p> <p>There are two kinds of news. One, chattering over an agency wire, rolling 24 hours a day on cable TV or beeping across the net, is instant. Something's happened: something goes out. But that is not the essence of daily newspaper life, nor of terrestrial television's big bulletins. Here a single deadline rules, and that often permits a moment or two to think, to weigh, to assess. You get a certain rough judgment as well as the facts. </p> <p>ITN's News at Ten - before the moguls shunted it - always had the edge on the BBC at 9pm because, in the normal rhythm of things, its editors had been able to pause for thought, to construct an agenda which wasn't merely a summation of the day just gone but a half step into tomorrow's future. Now, as the moguls stew in their own juice, the Beeb has seized the slightly higher ground: late enough for reflection (and American and parliamentary completeness), early enough to catch the punters before they go to bed. Whatever the other scheduling advantages, however the ratings battle goes, a terrestrial 10pm works best for news. </p> <p>But is our culture, media and sports compendium of a secretary of state happy? On the contrary, he seems darkly, volubly unhappy, jawboning away to the moguls in conference about his plans to bring the corporation to heel. If audiences at 10pm have fallen below audiences at 9pm after six trial months, then an affronted Smith will find the governors in breach of their charter obligations. And anyway - hint, hint - the BBC's governors are already signing their own death warrant. The secretary of state has a new broadcasting bill in the works and one of its much-trailed provisions will strip the governing board of its regulatory powers, handing them over to a single \"new\" regulator (which sounds strangely akin to the old independent television commission when he talks about it). </p> <p>So size (of audience) matters. So quality (of the news) doesn't enter the equation. So due deference to politicians carries greater weight than the experience of news professionals, the inevitable demands of competitive channels, the opinion of governors appointed (by government) to exercise that opinion. What was insupportable when ITV wanted to shift the news from ten, now becomes insupportable when the BBC shifts its news to ten. </p> <p>In the early days of Labour revival, there was much to admire about Chris Smith. He was intellectually crisp, courageously relaxed about his private life - and rather unlucky to get culture rather then health when the victory portfolios were doled out. He's not done badly since, either. For all his current desuetude, he was an early Dome sceptic. Sport has a few gold medals to wave. </p> <p>But he lets himself down when he constantly hectors and lectures the broadcasters, a kind of latterday Gerald Kaufman with ministerial clout. That is not his job or his role. He's there to hold the ring, not keep leaping into it. He is not there for detailed prescription. </p> <p>Of course, the present regulation of broadcasting doesn't make tidy sense. Any possibility of that vanished when Mrs T put Rupert Murdoch in her satellite club. Of course, as Mr Smith says, ITV's prolonged hassle with the ITC over News at Ten sits oddly with the swift acquiescence of the BBC's in-house regulators to a parallel news move (not to mention their junking, virtually overnight, of the Birt legacy they themselves superintended and defended). In a perfect world, the entirety of regulation might be less onerous and more equal - if, indeed, it is needed amid the proliferation of channels and choices. </p> <p>There is a case for reform embracing technical change, for a green paper, a debate and even, in time, for a broadcasting bill. There is, though, no palatable case for considering any of this now, in the last months before a general election. When Mr Smith says that the BBC and its governors have six months to prove their case about the ten o'clock shift - and not the year that chairman Bland has nominated - what does he mean?

      "bodyText": "Here is a prediction about tonight's BBC news at 10pm. It will be better than last Friday's news at 9pm. Not because the tenor of the news itself will necessarily have changed - it will probably be pretty dire as usual - but because the extra hour counts. Time (attention Chris Smith) matters. There are two kinds of news. One, chattering over an agency wire, rolling 24 hours a day on cable TV or beeping across the net, is instant. Something's happened: something goes out. But that is not the essence of daily newspaper life, nor of terrestrial television's big bulletins. Here a single deadline rules, and that often permits a moment or two to think, to weigh, to assess. You get a certain rough judgment as well as the facts. ITN's News at Ten - before the moguls shunted it - always had the edge on the BBC at 9pm because, in the normal rhythm of things, its editors had been able to pause for thought, to construct an agenda which wasn't merely a summation of the day just gone but a half step into tomorrow's future. Now, as the moguls stew in their own juice, the Beeb has seized the slightly higher ground: late enough for reflection (and American and parliamentary completeness), early enough to catch the punters before they go to bed. Whatever the other scheduling advantages, however the ratings battle goes, a terrestrial 10pm works best for news. But is our culture, media and sports compendium of a secretary of state happy? On the contrary, he seems darkly, volubly unhappy, jawboning away to the moguls in conference about his plans to bring the corporation to heel. If audiences at 10pm have fallen below audiences at 9pm after six trial months, then an affronted Smith will find the governors in breach of their charter obligations. And anyway - hint, hint - the BBC's governors are already signing their own death warrant. The secretary of state has a new broadcasting bill in the works and one of its much-trailed provisions will strip the governing board of its regulatory powers, handing them over to a single \"new\" regulator (which sounds strangely akin to the old independent television commission when he talks about it). So size (of audience) matters. So quality (of the news) doesn't enter the equation. So due deference to politicians carries greater weight than the experience of news professionals, the inevitable demands of competitive channels, the opinion of governors appointed (by government) to exercise that opinion. What was insupportable when ITV wanted to shift the news from ten, now becomes insupportable when the BBC shifts its news to ten. In the early days of Labour revival, there was much to admire about Chris Smith. He was intellectually crisp, courageously relaxed about his private life - and rather unlucky to get culture rather then health when the victory portfolios were doled out. He's not done badly since, either. For all his current desuetude, he was an early Dome sceptic. Sport has a few gold medals to wave. But he lets himself down when he constantly hectors and lectures the broadcasters, a kind of latterday Gerald Kaufman with ministerial clout. That is not his job or his role. He's there to hold the ring, not keep leaping into it. He is not there for detailed prescription. Of course, the present regulation of broadcasting doesn't make tidy sense. Any possibility of that vanished when Mrs T put Rupert Murdoch in her satellite club. Of course, as Mr Smith says, ITV's prolonged hassle with the ITC over News at Ten sits oddly with the swift acquiescence of the BBC's in-house regulators to a parallel news move (not to mention their junking, virtually overnight, of the Birt legacy they themselves superintended and defended). In a perfect world, the entirety of regulation might be less onerous and more equal - if, indeed, it is needed amid the proliferation of channels and choices. There is a case for reform embracing technical change, for a green paper, a debate and even, in time, for a broadcasting bill. There is, though, no palatable case for considering any of this now, in the last months before a general election. When Mr Smith says that the BBC and its governors have six months to prove their case about the ten o'clock shift - and not the year that chairman Bland has nominated - what does he mean? He means that he anticipates another row, with menaces attached, before and not after an election: that the heat can be turned up to suit the government he serves.

      "body": "<p>As the champagne bubbles fade and the new faces in TV drama land nurse their hangovers, the awesome challenge they face will soon become apparent. </p> <p>Drama was always the heart of the ratings battleground, but as the two main channels enter an Olympian battle for audiences, the relentless search for popular series will get even tougher. </p> <p>And just as the battle intensifies, it seems that the audiences are getting more sophisticated than ever. It is no longer simply enough to cast a well-known soap actor in a starring role and watch the ratings stack up: viewers want more. Today, it is not Cracker, Morse or Wexford which pulls in the crowds and the plaudits; it is ensemble drama such as the Royle Family, This Life, Queer as Folk and Clocking Off. </p> <p>Paul Abbott, who was behind Clocking Off, says the BBC has a bright future under Jane Tranter, but urges a change in attitudes at the corporation if success is to return. \"BBC drama still has the brand edge, even though this hasn't been matched by the audiences. People have got to think about how to entertain at the same time as producing distinctive drama.\" The BBC must no longer measure its hit rate by how cheaply it can achieve high ratings, he says. </p> <p>Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, has long been hailed a staple of the BBC's spartan success in returning drama; yet the edifice has crumbled with the latest series after ITV scheduled Who Wants to be a Millionaire? against it. A two-year-old quiz show should not have caused such a catastrophic ratings collapse at Holby. There has to be a question mark over its future. </p> <p>Abbott says the BBC and ITV must end the practice of churning out poor-quality drama just because they have recognisable stars: Harbour Lights and Sunburn (Nick Berry and Michelle Collins) and ITV's In Defence (Ross Kemp) are examples of ill-thought out concepts that started with the star rather than the idea. \"It's just not good enough for the audience,\" he says. </p> <p>While the BBC tackles its own tribulations, Andy Harries, the newly-installed controller of drama and comedy at ITV production powerhouse, Granada, says the commercial network can not simply bask in its drama success. ITV insiders take the Tranter threat seriously, and Harries urges a drama rethink. \"Drama is the battleground of British TV at the moment, and we have to think whether we are doing the right range of shows.\" </p> <p>He cites Cold Feet, Meet the Braithwaites and Bad Girls as the biggest ITV hits of recent years - all are the \"ensemble\" pieces that Abbott cites as the future of TV drama. ITV must abandon the elusive search for the family sitcom, a genre he describes as \"dead\", and tap into the success of family drama such as Carlton's Goodnight Mister Tom and The Railway Children. \"I for one will not be making any cop shows or any violent programmes. There will be no bodybags or headless corpses - there's too much of it. We should be making more 'warm' drama.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the champagne bubbles fade and the new faces in TV drama land nurse their hangovers, the awesome challenge they face will soon become apparent. Drama was always the heart of the ratings battleground, but as the two main channels enter an Olympian battle for audiences, the relentless search for popular series will get even tougher. And just as the battle intensifies, it seems that the audiences are getting more sophisticated than ever. It is no longer simply enough to cast a well-known soap actor in a starring role and watch the ratings stack up: viewers want more. Today, it is not Cracker, Morse or Wexford which pulls in the crowds and the plaudits; it is ensemble drama such as the Royle Family, This Life, Queer as Folk and Clocking Off. Paul Abbott, who was behind Clocking Off, says the BBC has a bright future under Jane Tranter, but urges a change in attitudes at the corporation if success is to return. \"BBC drama still has the brand edge, even though this hasn't been matched by the audiences. People have got to think about how to entertain at the same time as producing distinctive drama.\" The BBC must no longer measure its hit rate by how cheaply it can achieve high ratings, he says. Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, has long been hailed a staple of the BBC's spartan success in returning drama; yet the edifice has crumbled with the latest series after ITV scheduled Who Wants to be a Millionaire? against it. A two-year-old quiz show should not have caused such a catastrophic ratings collapse at Holby. There has to be a question mark over its future. Abbott says the BBC and ITV must end the practice of churning out poor-quality drama just because they have recognisable stars: Harbour Lights and Sunburn (Nick Berry and Michelle Collins) and ITV's In Defence (Ross Kemp) are examples of ill-thought out concepts that started with the star rather than the idea. \"It's just not good enough for the audience,\" he says. While the BBC tackles its own tribulations, Andy Harries, the newly-installed controller of drama and comedy at ITV production powerhouse, Granada, says the commercial network can not simply bask in its drama success. ITV insiders take the Tranter threat seriously, and Harries urges a drama rethink. \"Drama is the battleground of British TV at the moment, and we have to think whether we are doing the right range of shows.\" He cites Cold Feet, Meet the Braithwaites and Bad Girls as the biggest ITV hits of recent years - all are the \"ensemble\" pieces that Abbott cites as the future of TV drama. ITV must abandon the elusive search for the family sitcom, a genre he describes as \"dead\", and tap into the success of family drama such as Carlton's Goodnight Mister Tom and The Railway Children. \"I for one will not be making any cop shows or any violent programmes. There will be no bodybags or headless corpses - there's too much of it. We should be making more 'warm' drama.\"",

      "body": "<p>Last weekend, journalist Lowell Bergman and legal worker Erin Brockovich received awards from the California First Amendment Coalition in recognition of their work on behalf of \"freedom of information, freedom of expression and open government\". This must surely have been the first time that the awards have been won by people who had been portrayed on screen within the previous year by, respectively, Al Pacino and Julia Roberts. </p> <p>Bergman was the producer at CBS's 60 Minutes who worked with tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand to expose the dishonesties of the business, but found his bosses unwilling to run the story until it had already been published in the press. The story became the Michael Mann film The Insider, which won Oscar nominations for Russell Crowe, who played Wigand, and Christopher Plummer, who played CBS's veteran correspondent Mike Wallace in a not wholly flattering way. It focused attention not only on the duplicity of the tobacco industry but also on the whole issue of self-censorship in journalism and the timidity of the large news corporations. CBS and Wallace were less than happy with the way they emerged in the film. </p> <p>Bergman, who is to talk at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival this Friday, has just been back on the front pages, but this time reporting the news rather than making it. His investigation into the failed drug war in the United States, which showed that major US companies were routinely used for laundering Colombian cocaine profits, was on the front page of the New York Times. It was included in a two-part television documentary on the public broadcasting channel last week. </p> <p>He left CBS at the time of the row over The Insider, but has found that one of the predictions in his film did not come true. \"The movie helps to get people to return my phone-calls,\" he says, noting that there is a line in the movie where Al Pacino says to his wife \"Take the 60 Minutes out of 'Lowell Bergman from 60 Minutes' and no one will return my phone-calls.\" In other ways, being played by Al Pacino (who made the character more manic and intense than this rather cheerful and easy-going man appears to be) has not dramatically changed his life. \"I figure I'm a minor celebrity for a relatively short period of time. I'm old enough to know this ain't going to last.\" </p> <p>Some of the bad blood left by the film, which showed CBS executives dodging the confrontation with tobacco giants Brown and Williamson, has not dried. Bergman says he made an attempt at rapprochement with Wallace - now 82 and something of an American institution like, say, the late Sir Robin Day was in Britain - who has angrily denounced both Bergman and the film. \"He [Wallace] said a lot of things he shouldn't have said but - he's Mike.\" </p> <p>Bergman said he had read an article after what he had thought was a fairly friendly meeting in which Wallace claimed that Bergman had come to his house on his hands and knees begging for his job back. \"It's much more important for him to prove somehow that he's the top ape on the hill. Maybe at some point he will be willing to have a conversation that is reasonable.\" </p> <p>He had seen Wigand recently, now part of a small anti-smoking foundation and testifying to the World Health Organisation in Geneva. \"He is still followed around by a team of tobacco industry 'truth-tellers' who try and undermine him.\" Bergman says Russell Crowe's portrayal of Wigand as an ordinary, sometimes flawed, character was important. \"He's just a person, not someone who set out to blow the whistle on the industry. He was scared, he said some things that he didn't really mean to the company, he had all the problems the average person would have. For reporters, it's important to have that up there. People assume that sources are somehow different, that they're not real people.\" </p> <p>The Insider also highlighted the sometimes delicate relationship between television documentary producer and reporter in a world where the on-camera face often takes all of the kudos for an investigation. \"The producer takes care of the correspondent, you feed them lines, you feed them research, you make sure they don't have dandruff on their shoulders. Basically, you are a maintenance person on top of being a reporter and and the rest of the stuff. That's the job I was paid for.\" </p> <p>Bergman works freelance now for Frontline, the documentary news series, and teaches at the Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley, where we met. He likes working with students, who make eager researchers even if they also make him feel old. </p> <p>He was born in 1945, to a Hungarian emigre father and a mother of central European origins, and grew up in Brooklyn and Queens. He did a PhD on the history of philosophy at University of California in San Diego, under the radical German philosopher Herbert Marcuse - who was then facing death threats from rightwing vigilantes - at a time when the city was the main staging area for the war in Vietnam. Bergman's involvement in the civil rights and anti-war movements gave him a taste for muck-raking and he soon discovered that there was plenty of muck to rake. </p> <p>He abandoned academia for journalism with the underground San Diego paper, the Street Journal. Unable to join the official journalists' union, he and his colleagues formed what became at that time the largest chapter of the Wobblies (the legendary Industrial Workers of the World). \"We thought it was hilarious, but the local anti-communist conspiracy people couldn't figure us out.\" </p> <p>He worked on Rolling Stone during its days in San Francisco but did not want to move to New York when it relocated and on Christmas Eve 1976 was fired by its editor Jann Wenner - himself portrayed in the new film Almost Famous, the story of then RS jounalist Cameron Crowe. \"He did give me a letter, though, saying I was still employed, so I got my mortgage.\" </p> <p>Bergman helped found the Centre for Investigative Reporting, which eventually brought together like-minded journalists from around the world to produce documentaries. </p> <p>After All the President's Men, the book and film about the Watergate expose by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, fashions had changed in journalism and the mainstream wanted the new brand of reporter. He was offered a job at ABC, where he stayed until he joined 60 Minutes in 1983, a post he held with a short break until his departure. </p> <p>He feels that American television journalism is at a crossroads now, with many of the networks, led by Rupert Murdoch's Fox, feeling they have little or no obligation to cover major international stories that may be time-consuming, expensive and unlikely to figure on the ratings which increasingly drive the stations. He is hopeful that the growth of cable and the internet may open the way for more documentaries such as his recent project about the drug wars. </p> <p>\"The big dilemma here is defining what is news. Is it news to chase a car with the police? Is it news to go to the latest Hollywood parties, to do the latest violent incident?\" He fears that the special legal and constitutional status that American journalists have, unlike their British counterparts, could be undermined by the trivialisation of current affairs. \"If you start to say that we'll spend any amount of money chasing the motorcycle paparazzi around Princess Di, but we're not going to spend a dime on the massacres of East Timor, then why should you have any special privileges?\" </p> <p>Working in both print and television, he has had a chance to see the tensions between the two. \"Print journalists generally look at television producers as dangerous because they take your print story, put pictures to it and take the credit. Television journalists will often look at print journalists as seeing only the micro-story - they don't step back and see the thing that people would really care about. But, more or less, the television journalists are scavenging the print people a lot, especially in the magazine show area. Television doesn't deal well with grey areas or with developmental stories that span a period of time.\" </p> <p>He has been in Britain before, mainly to work, often on arms-dealing stories; he was fortuitously in a taxi going past Harrods when it was blown up by the IRA and spent the next 72 hours reporting for ABC. Of the differences between the British and American press, he says: \"you [British] get away with personalised reporting that I don't count as real reporting. I suppose the Brits have been repressed a lot longer than the colonials. </p> <p>\"There is a great tradition of serious social reporting [in the US] that is over 100 years old, so we take ourselves somewhat more seriously than maybe you guys do. Journalism actually became a kind of profession in the United States at a certain point, particularly in the wake of Watergate.\" And maybe in the same way that a generation of young journalists were inspired by All the President's Men to get out and get digging, so a new generation may see The Insider and decide to go and be that bloke played by Al Pacino.</p>",

Is it news to go to the latest Hollywood parties, to do the latest violent incident?\" He fears that the special legal and constitutional status that American journalists have, unlike their British counterparts, could be undermined by the trivialisation of current affairs. \"If you start to say that we'll spend any amount of money chasing the motorcycle paparazzi around Princess Di, but we're not going to spend a dime on the massacres of East Timor, then why should you have any special privileges?\" Working in both print and television, he has had a chance to see the tensions between the two. \"Print journalists generally look at television producers as dangerous because they take your print story, put pictures to it and take the credit. Television journalists will often look at print journalists as seeing only the micro-story - they don't step back and see the thing that people would really care about. But, more or less, the television journalists are scavenging the print people a lot, especially in the magazine show area. Television doesn't deal well with grey areas or with developmental stories that span a period of time.\" He has been in Britain before, mainly to work, often on arms-dealing stories; he was fortuitously in a taxi going past Harrods when it was blown up by the IRA and spent the next 72 hours reporting for ABC. Of the differences between the British and American press, he says: \"you [British] get away with personalised reporting that I don't count as real reporting. I suppose the Brits have been repressed a lot longer than the colonials. \"There is a great tradition of serious social reporting [in the US] that is over 100 years old, so we take ourselves somewhat more seriously than maybe you guys do. Journalism actually became a kind of profession in the United States at a certain point, particularly in the wake of Watergate.\" And maybe in the same way that a generation of young journalists were inspired by All the President's Men to get out and get digging, so a new generation may see The Insider and decide to go and be that bloke played by Al Pacino.",

      "body": "<p>Shopping on the internet is as easy as A, B, C. So says the BBC which, although best-known as Britain's public service broadcaster, last Sunday week began a two-month bus roadshow to help the public shop online, and next week, in partnership with children's imprint Ladybird Books, publishes How it Works, Shopping on the Internet. </p> <p>How kind of Auntie to hold our hand while we shop online. Except that this initiative has little to do with altruism: the hope is that by encouraging a greater number of people into e-commerce, more money can be raised to help fund BBC radio and TV. </p> <p>It's a curious rationale, but the BBC is no stranger to such logic. In this case it's all about beeb.com, the corporation's three-and-a-half-year-old commercial internet service overseen by BBC Worldwide, reinventing and better positioning itself to turn a profit. </p> <p>From its launch, beeb.com has comprised a selection of the BBC's more commercial brands - mainly magazine spin-offs from BBC programmes - revised for online consumption. Limited e-commerce has been available to surfers clicking on banner ads through which they were whisked off to advertisers' own websites. </p> <p>A strategic review, however, concluded that this in itself was not maximising the potential for a commercial BBC online service. The upshot was the decision to reposition beeb.com, a process that started in December 1999 and culminated in a high-profile, \u00a37m national advertising campaign which kicked off last month. </p> <p>The beeb.com roadshow and Ladybird book (the latter idea taken from the current advertising, to stress how anyone can learn the best way to shop online) is part of this re-positioning initiative. </p> <p>\"The idea is to establish the [beeb.com] brand with the message that there is a degree of safety and a certain naturalness about doing e-business with the BBC,\" says Julian Turner, chief executive of Beeb Ventures, the majority-owned subsidiary of BBC Worldwide which runs the beeb.com site. \"As a shopping intermediary we offer the safety of a trusted environment and approved third-party partnerships.\" </p> <p>So from now on beeb.com is to be known as an internet shopping portal. Surfers visiting the site can select from a variety of subject areas, all of which are directly linked to pre-existing BBC brands ranging from magazines such as Top of the Pops and Gardeners' World to programmes such as BBC Holiday. Each themed area provides online editorial content related to specific types of product. Users can ask experts for advice on which product to buy, or call up other related information. </p> <p>The next step, however, is the nub of the new beeb.com service. Once users know what they want, they can call up details of different online suppliers - each of whom is a commercial partner in the beeb.com site - to compare price and delivery times. They then click on a preferred supplier to go direct to its site to complete the transaction online. To date, beeb.com has struck deals with 37 commercial partners which are featured on the site. Turner expects this figure to have risen to more than 60 by Christmas. </p> <p>It is through such commercial partnerships and banner advertising that beeb.com hopes to make money. Partners pay for the BBC association. In return, however, they must provide a good-quality, reliable and fairly priced service that reflects well on the BBC brand. No such relationship will be entered into with any commercial partner on an exclusive basis, Turner adds: \"It's not about the BBC becoming an e-tailer,\" he claims. \"It's about being a shopping intermediary which can offer a safe and trusted shopping environment and approved third-party relationships.\" </p> <p>It's certainly a step on from what beeb.com was doing previously - and one that is now being funded through a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and US-based internet firm TH Lee Global Internet Managers. This deal, announced in August, involved THLi investing a cool \u00a332.5m in beeb.com and freebeeb.net, the BBC's internet service provider. The transaction valued the two businesses at \u00a3240m. </p> <p>But the new beeb.com is not a development welcomed by Auntie's commercial competitors. Although not funded directly by the licence fee, the programme brands on which it is cashing in are, critics lament. Angela Mills of the British Internet Publishers' Alliance, whose members include not only traditional media owners with online interests but also pure internet-only businesses, expresses concern at the BBC's latest move. </p> <p>\"Because its positioning is 'shop here without trawling around lots of other websites', and because the brands it promotes heavily are all BBC brands developed by licence-fee funding, it's another example of the unfair competitive advantage the BBC has over its commercial competitors,\" she says. </p> <p>The BBC's public service sites, meanwhile, should provide no direct link with beeb.com, she adds: \"It's not as if they do so for any of beeb.com's commercial rivals.\" Although Turner stresses that all surfers are doing is moving from the corporation's public service to commercial online sites, and also insists beeb.com gives no undue prominence to BBC brands, Mills counters: \"This is little more than paying lip service to open access.\" </p> <p> Rob Hersov, chief executive of internet sports service Sportal, meanwhile, does not believe that the BBC should be on the net at all - either in a public service or a commercial capacity. \"It is impossible to name one public service they are giving [on the net] that a privately funded company is not providing already,\" he says. And of the corporation's commercial online activities, Hersov adds: \"They should not be doing any of these at all. [BBC Worldwide] should be sold off.\" </p> <p>Like it or loathe it, however, BBC Worldwide's brief is to raise funds through commercial activities that can be fed back into the BBC to supplement income earned from the licence fee. Given that this is its remit, Beeb Ventures - like the rest of the internet business - is surely justified in its desire to grow the internet population, not just for itself but for everyone, Turner says. </p> <p>\"What people forget is that if you link the BBC name with e-commerce, then you grow internet business for all,\" he claims. \"If we bring one new person onto the net, then we help everyone, as that person's propensity to go on to transact with other e-commerce sites is significant.\" </p> <p>Whether or not this continues to be an acceptable rationale for the public service broadcaster will become clear in coming months with the publication of a white paper on the BBC's future remit, and the expected introduction of a single broadcast industry regulator whose remit will include public service TV and all its related activities - including commercial initiatives online.</p>",

But Mark Thompson took over and feature-length docs were once again in favour, and Storyville - with more money, and more slots - was born. </p> <p>Hardly surprising, then, that on arriving at Channel 4, Jackson was less than enthusiastic about its long-standing, well-respected strand True Stories. \"If I look back through my diary, in 1995 True Stories transmitted on Thursdays at 9.30pm, in 1997 on Tuesdays at 9pm, but by 1998 it was all over the place, going out at different times and different nights,\" says Peter Moore, former head of documentaries at Channel 4. </p> <p>The present controller of documentaries, Peter Dale, doesn't see scheduling decisions as indicative of less commitment: \"I don't believe that audiences are as concerned with strand identity,\" he explains. \"What counts to someone choosing their evening's viewing is not whether there is a True Stories film on, but that there is a documentary about something they are interested in.\" </p> <p>He also regards time slots as mattering in terms of individual films, rather than across a strand: \"In commercial terms our impression of audience habits are changing - by 10.30pm people are ready to sit down and watch something more challenging. I fight for the best position in the schedules on an individual basis.\" </p> <p>He does admit, however that his is not a view always welcomed by film-makers: \"I do find it frustrating that many film-makers who have been around a long time don't accept that the broadcasting environment is more competitive than it once was, and find it hard to accept that that has implications for where their work is placed.\" </p> <p>Such a close consideration of ratings is something Nick Fraser is hoping to avoid: \"What I'm worried about is the prospect of an A list and a B list.

It tries very consciously in every way to have that effect. And that is a new approach.

The threat to readership, advertising and story exclusives is not one to be taken lightly. Yet the announcement, three months ago, that BBC Worldwide was to introduce another teen title into its range was greeted, perhaps not with a shrug, but certainly with a coolness that said the market felt confident that it had all bases covered. </p> <p>\"They obviously think there is some sort of niche - I can't think there is one,\" said Rebecca Martin, editor of Jump. \"It's hard to imagine what they could have uncovered that could be different,\" concurred Bliss editor Liz Nice. All of which had the BBC staff virtually apoplectic with excitement. As far as they were concerned it was staring them straight in the face. </p> <p>This week, Star magazine will be adding its weight to an already fat array of teenage glossies and glaring right back at the publishers who, as Jeremy Mark, editor-in-chief of the BBC's teenage projects, says, \"just couldn't see it\". Tapping into the age-old interest in celebrity, the new fortnightly takes inspiration from American magazines US Weekly, Entertainment Weekly and Teen People, but is best described as a younger, Americanised Hello!, OK! or Heat. In the first issue Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina the Teenage Witch) \"invites us into her stunning Los Angeles home\", while Nick Carter \"exclusively takes us scuba-diving with the Backstreet Boys in the Bahamas.\" For the cover story, Buffy actress Sarah Michelle Gellar opens up about \"the price of fame and why she has absolutely no regrets\". </p> <p>Star enters the arena at a time of much activity. In an effort to reflect the fact that their readers are getting older younger, magazines are being launched and relaunched all the time. Preparing to make an entrance on the teen scene some time next year are CosmoGirl, ElleGirl and Teen Vogue. Yet, despite targeting a similar age group, these are not developments that particularly irk Lindsaye Fox, group publisher for the BBC teenage products. \"Like the magazines that currently exist, these new entries are predominantly girl lifestyle titles. Sure, they have a smattering of celebrity content. But really their focus is on problems, relationships, fashion, beauty and other lifestyle issues.\" </p> <p>By contrast, Star's focus is pure celebrity. Where fashion and beauty exist, it is solely as a guide on how to mimic the look of the stars. Star is a magazine tapping exclusively into this all-intriguing and aspirational attitude to celebrities. \"In our research, we found a lot of teenagers weren't buying OK! or Hello! because they had Les Dennis or Catherine Zeta Jones on the cover, but they were reading it if they found it lying around because it had the odd bit about Gwyneth Paltrow or Westlife in it,\" says Fox. \"At the same time their lifestyle magazines were delivering them with what they wanted for lifestyle but weren't really satisfying that hardcore need to know everything there is about celebrities.\" </p> <p>An additional comfort for the Star team is the knowledge that this thirst for celebrities is one which transcends all age boundaries. While the content relevancy of magazines such as J17 or Bliss can only last so long, celebrity scoops remain a pull throughout the teenage years. </p> <p>Fox puts her target age group at 14-16, while the publicity cites a more ambitious 12-19. Jeremy Mark, who doubles up as editor of the title, isn't keen to pinpoint an age: \"I'd hate to put an age limit on it simply because there are elements of the magazine which have such wide appeal. A lot of my friends would read it,\" he says, \"and I'm 33.\" </p> <p>With an older, cleaner, simpler style, Star stands out from the loud and garish covers of its teen title rivals. However, Mark believes his product is unique in that it has no competitors. Emap, by contrast, haven't seen it that way. In a recent interview, Smash Hits editor John McKie admitted the \u00a32m Star launch was giving Emap bosses \"a bit of a headache.\" Yet with a look and content that could draw young adults into the bargain, the beleaguered Heat could be equally troubled. At present Heat editor Mark Frith denies losing much sleep over it: \"It's going to be stocked alongside teen mags,\" he says, \"and if it's not a teen mag then there's going to be a perception problem. There are no headaches here. We're totally bouyant.\" </p> <p>Heat has had trouble sustaining the big names and big circulation figures that it initially aspired to. With an ambitious 200,000 target readership (and promises of cover stories like Gellar to live up to), Star could conceivably do the same. However, with an additional Los Angeles office behind him, Mark is convinced he'll be able to draw the crowd-pullers to his pages. \"We capture that slightly older celebrity element. People who want to address the teen market but don't want to do baby girl glossies. We do well-styled shoots and candid interviews. The American publicists really like the kind of coverage can we give them.\" </p> <p>The youth market is known for its constant thirst for novelty and freshness so, in the short term at least, there is certainly room for something new. The real challenge for a magazine like Star is to sustain a level of originality that sees it through the novelty factor and the threat the internet poses. Teen titles were badly hit in recent ABCs with big names like Bliss, Smash Hits, J17 and TV Hits down year-on-year. Again, Fox brushes off the losses, pointing to the rise in the market value, due to higher priced titles. \"The volume sale may have fallen,\" she says, \"but the actual profitability in the market is very, very strong.\" </p> <p>Still, she remains aware \"it is an incredibly competitive market,\" and knows that her media-savvy audience are frequently drawn online. \"As internet sites become more aggressive we'll need to adapt, but, at the moment, as far as our audience are concerned it's just another media choice,\" says Fox. Which is why the magazine feels at ease with pointing its readers towards the net and recommending specific sites like hollywood.com or popboys.com which serve their readers with similar celebrity tittle-tattle. But Fox will not be moved from her confident stance. \"We'll keep an eye on it,\" she says, \"but at the moment teenagers don't seem to have any issues at all about mixing and merging their media.\" </p> <p><strong>Teen scene: what Star is up against</strong></p> <p><strong> CosmoGirl</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Likes to be known as:</strong> \"A cool new magazine for teens\". </p> <p><strong> Typical content:</strong> Totally humiliating sleepover stories, look hotsy-totsy in braces, the easiest workout ever, Boy-O-Meter, Mandy Moore's fashion must-haves, get to college for free. </p> <p><strong> Typical cover: </strong> Boy-band hunk styled in sexy muscle-exposing pose. </p> <p><strong> Random quote:</strong> (To actor Bryce Johnson) \"Okay, Bryce, tell us the truth: You were, like, totally popular when you were in high school, right?\" </p> <p><strong> Britney factor:</strong> Not a high Britney presence evident in the American CosmoGirl.

However, with an additional Los Angeles office behind him, Mark is convinced he'll be able to draw the crowd-pullers to his pages. \"We capture that slightly older celebrity element. People who want to address the teen market but don't want to do baby girl glossies. We do well-styled shoots and candid interviews. The American publicists really like the kind of coverage can we give them.\" The youth market is known for its constant thirst for novelty and freshness so, in the short term at least, there is certainly room for something new. The real challenge for a magazine like Star is to sustain a level of originality that sees it through the novelty factor and the threat the internet poses. Teen titles were badly hit in recent ABCs with big names like Bliss, Smash Hits, J17 and TV Hits down year-on-year. Again, Fox brushes off the losses, pointing to the rise in the market value, due to higher priced titles. \"The volume sale may have fallen,\" she says, \"but the actual profitability in the market is very, very strong.\" Still, she remains aware \"it is an incredibly competitive market,\" and knows that her media-savvy audience are frequently drawn online. \"As internet sites become more aggressive we'll need to adapt, but, at the moment, as far as our audience are concerned it's just another media choice,\" says Fox. Which is why the magazine feels at ease with pointing its readers towards the net and recommending specific sites like hollywood.com or popboys.com which serve their readers with similar celebrity tittle-tattle. But Fox will not be moved from her confident stance. \"We'll keep an eye on it,\" she says, \"but at the moment teenagers don't seem to have any issues at all about mixing and merging their media.\" Teen scene: what Star is up against CosmoGirl Likes to be known as: \"A cool new magazine for teens\". Typical content: Totally humiliating sleepover stories, look hotsy-totsy in braces, the easiest workout ever, Boy-O-Meter, Mandy Moore's fashion must-haves, get to college for free. Typical cover: Boy-band hunk styled in sexy muscle-exposing pose. Random quote: (To actor Bryce Johnson) \"Okay, Bryce, tell us the truth: You were, like, totally popular when you were in high school, right?\" Britney factor: Not a high Britney presence evident in the American CosmoGirl. More Britney stories are anticipated in the British launch next year. Star Likes to be known as: \"The celebrity magazine\". Typical content: Stephen Gately at the Billy Elliot premiere, Ronan Keating filming a TV ad for his autobiography at Luton Hoo, Jason Behr on Dawson's Creek, movies and on-screen smooching. Typical cover: Young Hollywood actress/singer styled in pouting seaside pose. Random quote: \"They chat and share a private joke. Although these two EastEnders stars may not have the same passion their characters share on-screen they truly are friends.\" Britney factor: Good potential. Bliss Likes to be known as: \"The mag that makes you famous\". Typical content: The girl who snogged Becks before Posh, Paris fashion with Precious, 100% Boys (Hot Posters!, Michael Owen exclusive, snogging sorted, the best and worst chat-up lines ever!) Typical cover: Natalie Appleton!!!! Random quote: \"They called me a slag!\" Britney factor: High. Including a \"How to look like Britney when you look nothing like Britney!\" feature. J-17 Likes to be known as: \"The world's coolest mag...definitely\". Typical content: My Gossip Hell! (How bitchin' ruined three girls' lives), Divorce - it's not the end of the world, six foxy lad posters, 15 pages of sussed advice and lad chat. Typical cover: Fresh young model of the Britney ilk. Random quote: \"I love the purple glitter socks. They're cool.\" Britney factor: Full page dedicated to how Britney gets her hair so super sleek. Interview with Billie Piper comes a close second",

To get some idea of the underlying problem, consider these unpalatable facts.

As with junkies, even those who sincerely seek to break their habit, the opposite inevitably happens: dependency increases. Having discovered a way to maintain their headline sales figures, papers have become indiscriminate in using bulks. </p> <p>Incidentally, the polite term for bulks is \"sampling\". It's claimed that the exercise is designed to put the paper into the hands of those who would not otherwise see it, therefore luring them into becoming regular buyers. After years of giving away papers in planes, hotels and fast-food restaurants, and still managing to lose sales, the transparent falsity of this claim is exposed. It is about massaging sales, not winning readers. </p> <p>Looking at the problem from the other direction, comparing genuine sales - the ones where people pay the stated cover price - shows how badly the industry is doing. In September last year the 12 dailies sold 11,237,974 copies at the full rate. In September this year that had fallen to 10,778,457, a decline of 4.1%. A similar comparison for the Sundays records a fall of 5.8%. Let's look at how this works in practice at one title. </p> <p>The Times's phenomenal circulation rise began in 1993 when its price was cut to the bone. Reluctantly, after years of selling below cost, its News International management was forced to raise the cover price. By the time it did so, the paper was able to exploit other gimmicks invented by rivals, such as the cheap pre-paid subscriptions pioneered - at enormous cost to its own bottom line - by the Telegraph group. Despite official pressure, the Times also realised it could go on using price-cutting on a regional basis. </p> <p>The result is revealed in the ABC figures for last month. The Times's total sale is declared to be 730,679. Of these, only 478,505 were sold at the full rate. More than 100,000 were sold at a discount, a further 67,000 were cheap subscription copies and more than 43,000 were given away for nothing. </p> <p>Even so, sales of the Times are falling. A year ago, when it was selling 50% more at full rate, relying on fewer subscriptions and fewer bulks, its overall sale was 12,000 higher than last month. It's hard not to conclude that the marketing initiatives have not been matched by editorial expertise. The paper has reached out to people and many of them, trying it at 10p or picking it up from a pile in an airport lounge, have rejected it. Executives will be hoping that the expensive relaunch of the Saturday sections nine days ago will stop the rot. </p> <p>For some indefinable reason, the Daily Telegraph - another paper living within the circulation drug culture - remains a more readable paper for a right-of-centre audience. Even its absurd leader page redesign hasn't put people off. </p> <p>The Times, meanwhile, is all over the place. The front page is often too jazzy, relying on visual impact at the expense of words, and this sense of the paper being \"over designed\" extends to the inside pages too. The news pages lack coherence, mixing the light and the serious in a confusing manner, and, whether true or not, there is a perception that, compared to the Telegraph, there is less to read. As the leader and op-ed pages remain much as they have been for years, the contrast between their sobriety and the rest of the paper is even more pronounced. There is much for editor Peter Stothard to think about when he returns from his enforced medical break to take back the reins from his stand-in Ben Preston. </p> <p>Another Wapping editor who should be thinking hard is the Sun's David Yelland. He will be delighted that he appears to have seen off the Mirror's sales challenge for the moment. His paper extended its lead last month and, year on year, is 2% up while the Mirror is 2% down. But what does the Sun stand for? Its political ambivalence, illustrated to an extent in the Media Guardian interview with the paper's political editor Trevor Kavanagh two weeks ago, must baffle readers. </p> <p>Worse, perhaps, is the way it warps its news values. Did anyone really think the childish reincarnation of William Hague as a parrot merited the front page on the day that Milosevic was overthrown in Serbia? Its enthusiasm for Tony Blair's New Labour has now reached the point at which former Mirror political guru Joe Haines, if he was still writing his column, would inevitably comment: \"The Sun's support for the Labour government resembles the way in which the executioner supports the hanged man.\" </p> <p>Apart from the Sun's obsession with Europe, which provides it with weekly, sometimes daily, leaders savaging Blair, there is no central thrust to its views on the government's policies. This, by the way, could equally be said of the Mirror, especially during the petrol crisis. But the Sun is more confusing because, though we know where the Mirror is coming from even when it misreads situations, Yelland's paper seesaws hopelessly. </p> <p>This ambiguity, stemming from the Tory prejudices of its senior executives and many junior staff too, leads it to make colossal errors. On Friday, for instance, it was obliged to publish a humbling apology to Alastair Campbell, and pay money to one of his children's schools, for a totally false story the day before. </p> <p>This claimed that Campbell \"put the boot into Britain\" by defending the Runnymede Trust's report which suggested the word \"British\" was racist. It repeated the claim in its leading article. In fact, Campbell's briefing, as reported by every other paper, reflected the disappointment of both Blair and home secretary Jack Straw at the report's conclusion. </p> <p>Why did the Sun get it so wrong? It could be a journalistic error, though I think it unlikely. In reality, the nation's best-selling red-top is true blue.

      "body": "<p>She's the 11-plus failure who went to a top university. The BBC secretary who rose to take charge of all its drama. A woman who even rivals describe as \"very personable, very credible\". \"You will be hard pressed to find anyone with a bad word about her,\" says Andrew Davies, TV writer and adapter. Last Thursday, months of negotiation and five years of recrimination ended when Jane Tranter, 37, was named BBC drama commissioner - a new title for an old idea. </p> <p>She is the BBC's supreme drama leader, the creative champion at its most critical hour. \"The BBC can claim a piece of your heart,\" says Tranter, in a line that could fit one of her trademark costume dramas. What was her manifesto? \"What got me the job was the programmes I made. My manifesto is my work.\" In the past three years Tranter's serials department has produced the goods - Warriors, Wives and Daughters, David Copperfield, Care, and Other People's Children. </p> <p>Such is her standing that director general Greg Dyke preferred her modern take to the more traditional tastes of ITV's drama controller, Nick Elliott.\"She seems to enjoy herself. And she has the confidence to back her own judgments. She's actually like Elliott,\" says one observer. It is also said that the BBC simply could not afford to lose her to rival Channel 4. </p> <p>Tranter's mission is to rescue the BBC's reputation from inconsistency and downright bad programmes (Badger, Fish), while turning the huge spending boost on popular drama conjured up by Dyke into successful hour-long series for BBC1 at 9pm, supporting the move of the news. BBC1 has to double the amount of hour-long dramas it shows each week from two hours to four. \"We have to decide what makes a popular BBC drama,\" says Tranter, wearing black leather trousers, jumper and silver jewellery. \"To decide how to fill the hours with unique, distinctive dramas, that are BBC as opposed to what any other channel does. Our audience expectation has been dulled in the last decade.\" </p> <p>Harbour Lights and Sunburn, she believes, might have been done well by ITV. From now on, dramas as star vehicles are out. \"We have to do it fast, but not by panicking, without knee-jerk commissioning. If we think we need to stuff the autumn full of overly popular things we'll fail. We need to re-present ourselves to the audience with the very best ideas, based on the very best scripts.\" </p> <p>But Alan Yentob and Mark Thompson have also recruited two very substantial players, ex-Granada drama controller Simon Lewis and his deputy Sue Hogg, to make popular drama series for BBC1, fresh from creating the ITV series Grafters and Always &amp; Everyone. </p> <p>But here lies some confusion more reminiscent of the old-style BBC drama department. Much has been made over the past few months of Tranter's anxiety to clarify her position in relation to the Granada importees, before accepting the big job. Lewis believes the pair report direct to Thompson, while working with Tranter. Tranter, meanwhile, says, \"I will commission projects from Simon Lewis, [I will commission] everything from everyone, apart from the soaps.\" </p> <p>Examples of BBC1 dramas which fit her bill? Holby City, Casualty, EastEnders, David Copperfield, Wives and Daughters, Pure Wickedness, Down to Earth (the new Sunday night hit) and The Sins, a forthcoming series starring Pete Postlethwaite, a pure Tranter product. \"Look what the BBC has grown up with - Z Cars, Edge of Darkness, early Bergeracs, Boys from the Blackstuff.\" These, she says, are the traditions and influences to build on. \"I call it modern-retro, look at the best we have been and sharpen up what we're doing now.\" </p> <p>She is not a well-known face. Too busy working, she's never courted outside attention. \"I can't think of an argument I've had which is not about a programme. I think if you have arguments with people about getting the programmes made, and your only agenda is to get the best possible result on screen, then people understand why sometimes you're tough.\" Those who work with her say she defuses rows with cutting humour. </p> <p> Born in Oxford, Tranter is the daughter of two teachers. Both were strong Methodists from families where the industrious, pious tradition went back generations. When she failed the 11-plus, her parents paid fees for St Helen's &amp; St Margaret's School near Oxford, and then Kingswood School, Bath, the Methodist public school. She is poised rather than posh. </p> <p>Wanting to be an \"urban chick\", she headed for King's College, London and an English degree only to find it \"not very interesting - I was really cross about it.\" Dickens was the most modern author she studied. She also took \"hideously uncool plays to Edinburgh - like a Man for All Seasons.\" </p> <p>With a certificate from an Oxford secretarial course, she joined the BBC in 1985, camouflaged as a secretary at BBC Radio Drama. But at 24 she became an assistant TV floor manager for EastEnders and Bergerac, and was launched. \"It was old-fashioned - a way to learn everything about TV while disguising your intent. The whole time I was interested in scripts and how they came to be commissioned.\" </p> <p>One criticism is that her experience is too concentrated on the words, rather than the overall production - yet producers say she knows when to intervene if stars play up. Her second BBC break came in 1987 when she moved to be assistant script editor on the fourth series of Casualty, and the third break when David Thompson, now head of BBC Films, took her on as a script editor, working on Screen One and Two. Her reputation grew, leading Carlton to headhunt her for its new TV franchise, as a drama commissioner. \"I could not resist. I'd never get that opportunity again,\" she says. </p> <p>At Carlton she backed Timothy Spall in the comedy drama, Frank Stubbs Promotes, Bramwell - the then-rising writing star Lucy Gannon's surprise hit about a Victorian woman doctor - and the regional soap, London Bridge. Her return to the BBC in 1997 coincided with the disastrous split between broadcasting and production which encouraged channel controllers to turn to independent producers. </p> <p>As she joined, several of the BBC's most respected drama executives were quitting the chaos (\"shouting 'see you, suckers!'\" Tranter recalls) for the independent sector. \"I'd always thought I would return to the BBC. I couldn't bear it when I was in ITV and it was considered great sport to pull BBC dramas to pieces, even if frequently they deserved to be.\" When Michael Wearing left, she took over the BBC serials department, home of Our Friends in the North and Pride and Prejudice. </p> <p>\"An executive producer has a finger in many pies, you have an overview, provide a safety net, quality control; you get all of the blame, none of the credit. I love it. It is a job without boredom, you're in production 365 days a year, working at a cracking pace. I love the adrenalin of production going on all around you.\" </p> <p>Andrew Davies gives an insight into how Tranter works. When his Carlton drama Wilderness, about a woman who turns into a wolf, was bogged down, he recalls, \"she just went away, wrote a set of terrific notes and showed us a way through the difficulties. She is someone whose opinions are valued.\" </p> <p>Tranter says of the recent arid period: \"Part of the problem was that BBC drama had allowed itself to get overgrown and unventilated. It's always easy to look inward, into a bureaucracy. As soon as you do that, you're done for. You have got to understand the structures, but you have to look outside, to the audiences, concentrate on making programmes. I never changed my modus operandi. </p> <p>\"So [in serials] we put our heads down and made the programmes. Coming from ITV, the BBC was simple. I wrote out commissioning forms for development funds [for new dramas]. To have them green-lit I went across the road to [BBC1 controller] Peter Salmon, who'd joined at same time. He gave backing for Peter Kosminsky [Warriors] and William Ivory [The Sins].\" </p> <p>Her guarantee to the talent, she says, is that if she says it will happen, it will - and systems and structures be damned. Whether she can repeat that trick while running the show is another matter entirely.</p>",

We need to re-present ourselves to the audience with the very best ideas, based on the very best scripts.\" But Alan Yentob and Mark Thompson have also recruited two very substantial players, ex-Granada drama controller Simon Lewis and his deputy Sue Hogg, to make popular drama series for BBC1, fresh from creating the ITV series Grafters and Always &amp; Everyone. But here lies some confusion more reminiscent of the old-style BBC drama department. Much has been made over the past few months of Tranter's anxiety to clarify her position in relation to the Granada importees, before accepting the big job. Lewis believes the pair report direct to Thompson, while working with Tranter. Tranter, meanwhile, says, \"I will commission projects from Simon Lewis, [I will commission] everything from everyone, apart from the soaps.\" Examples of BBC1 dramas which fit her bill? Holby City, Casualty, EastEnders, David Copperfield, Wives and Daughters, Pure Wickedness, Down to Earth (the new Sunday night hit) and The Sins, a forthcoming series starring Pete Postlethwaite, a pure Tranter product. \"Look what the BBC has grown up with - Z Cars, Edge of Darkness, early Bergeracs, Boys from the Blackstuff.\" These, she says, are the traditions and influences to build on. \"I call it modern-retro, look at the best we have been and sharpen up what we're doing now.\" She is not a well-known face. Too busy working, she's never courted outside attention. \"I can't think of an argument I've had which is not about a programme. I think if you have arguments with people about getting the programmes made, and your only agenda is to get the best possible result on screen, then people understand why sometimes you're tough.\" Those who work with her say she defuses rows with cutting humour. Born in Oxford, Tranter is the daughter of two teachers. Both were strong Methodists from families where the industrious, pious tradition went back generations. When she failed the 11-plus, her parents paid fees for St Helen's &amp; St Margaret's School near Oxford, and then Kingswood School, Bath, the Methodist public school. She is poised rather than posh. Wanting to be an \"urban chick\", she headed for King's College, London and an English degree only to find it \"not very interesting - I was really cross about it.\" Dickens was the most modern author she studied. She also took \"hideously uncool plays to Edinburgh - like a Man for All Seasons.\" With a certificate from an Oxford secretarial course, she joined the BBC in 1985, camouflaged as a secretary at BBC Radio Drama. But at 24 she became an assistant TV floor manager for EastEnders and Bergerac, and was launched. \"It was old-fashioned - a way to learn everything about TV while disguising your intent. The whole time I was interested in scripts and how they came to be commissioned.\" One criticism is that her experience is too concentrated on the words, rather than the overall production - yet producers say she knows when to intervene if stars play up. Her second BBC break came in 1987 when she moved to be assistant script editor on the fourth series of Casualty, and the third break when David Thompson, now head of BBC Films, took her on as a script editor, working on Screen One and Two. Her reputation grew, leading Carlton to headhunt her for its new TV franchise, as a drama commissioner. \"I could not resist. I'd never get that opportunity again,\" she says. At Carlton she backed Timothy Spall in the comedy drama, Frank Stubbs Promotes, Bramwell - the then-rising writing star Lucy Gannon's surprise hit about a Victorian woman doctor - and the regional soap, London Bridge. Her return to the BBC in 1997 coincided with the disastrous split between broadcasting and production which encouraged channel controllers to turn to independent producers. As she joined, several of the BBC's most respected drama executives were quitting the chaos (\"shouting 'see you, suckers!'\" Tranter recalls) for the independent sector. \"I'd always thought I would return to the BBC. I couldn't bear it when I was in ITV and it was considered great sport to pull BBC dramas to pieces, even if frequently they deserved to be.\" When Michael Wearing left, she took over the BBC serials department, home of Our Friends in the North and Pride and Prejudice. \"An executive producer has a finger in many pies, you have an overview, provide a safety net, quality control; you get all of the blame, none of the credit. I love it. It is a job without boredom, you're in production 365 days a year, working at a cracking pace. I love the adrenalin of production going on all around you.\" Andrew Davies gives an insight into how Tranter works. When his Carlton drama Wilderness, about a woman who turns into a wolf, was bogged down, he recalls, \"she just went away, wrote a set of terrific notes and showed us a way through the difficulties. She is someone whose opinions are valued.\" Tranter says of the recent arid period: \"Part of the problem was that BBC drama had allowed itself to get overgrown and unventilated. It's always easy to look inward, into a bureaucracy. As soon as you do that, you're done for. You have got to understand the structures, but you have to look outside, to the audiences, concentrate on making programmes. I never changed my modus operandi. \"So [in serials] we put our heads down and made the programmes. Coming from ITV, the BBC was simple. I wrote out commissioning forms for development funds [for new dramas]. To have them green-lit I went across the road to [BBC1 controller] Peter Salmon, who'd joined at same time. He gave backing for Peter Kosminsky [Warriors] and William Ivory [The Sins].\" Her guarantee to the talent, she says, is that if she says it will happen, it will - and systems and structures be damned. Whether she can repeat that trick while running the show is another matter entirely.",

      "body": "<p>The Tawang valley in India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is a remote place. A few tribal farmers live here. The occasional hunter can be seen slogging up its hillsides. Were it not for the fact the Buddhist mountain region occupies a pivotal place in India's relations with China, the valley would remain one of the country's most obscure and underdeveloped areas.</p> <p>As it is, the roads leading deep into its interior are in excellent condition, even during the monsoon months. Their construction is a legacy of the war which China and India fought in the Tawang Valley in 1962. The war saw the Chinese invade the valley and press on as far as Tezpur in Assam, inflicting heavy casualties and humiliation on Indian troops. The Chinese eventually withdrew to what is now known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p> <p>Nearly four decades later the area is still a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers. Confirmation of this came last Friday, when Arunachal Pradesh's chief minister, Mukut Mithi, alleged that Chinese troops had been making regular forays across the highly sensitive border.</p> <p>\"Maybe they have crossed the border without knowing where the LAC stands - but in any case this has to be stopped,\" he said.</p> <p>Over the weekend Mr Mithi escorted a party of journalists up to the Sino-Indian border to prove his point. He showed them what he said was a new Chinese-built mule trail in the Dibang valley district, and claimed that \"repeated incursions\" were taking place. \"Normally they come in the guise of graziers or hunters by encroaching on the LAC. Sometimes they claim that the land belongs to them,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether the incursions are genuine or imaginary, they speak volumes about the continuing mutual mistrust which exists between New Delhi and Beijing. India still lays claim to 40,000 sq kms (16,000 sq miles) of territory occupied by China in Kashmir, while China lays claim to a wide swathe of territory in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 650-mile border with China.</p> <p>Unlike the disputed border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, where rival troops shell each other every day, the Sino-Indian frontier does not ring with gunfire. Postal workers from both countries even exchange letters for villagers who live next to the LAC. China and India recently set up a working party to clarify the issue. But the tension continues: in 1986 the Red army allegedly constructed a helipad at the frontier, only for it to be demolished by Indian troops.</p> <p>On the diplomatic front, relations between Indian and China remain outwardly cordial. India's president paid a successful visit to Beijing earlier this year. China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, came to India in July.</p> <p>But there exists plenty of suspicion too, most of it concerning the nuclear issue. India continues to accuse China of helping its archrival Pakistan to acquire advanced nuclear missile technology. US intelligence and military sources confirm that Pakistan's nuclear programme is more advanced than India's because of assistance from China and North Korea.</p> <p>In 1998 India and Pakistan carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests. India's defence minister, George Fernandes, defended the action on the grounds that India faced a nuclear threat from China. Last month he announced that India's latest inter-continental missile, Agni III, would be ready for testing \"sooner than expected\".

      "bodyText": "The Tawang valley in India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is a remote place. A few tribal farmers live here. The occasional hunter can be seen slogging up its hillsides. Were it not for the fact the Buddhist mountain region occupies a pivotal place in India's relations with China, the valley would remain one of the country's most obscure and underdeveloped areas. As it is, the roads leading deep into its interior are in excellent condition, even during the monsoon months. Their construction is a legacy of the war which China and India fought in the Tawang Valley in 1962. The war saw the Chinese invade the valley and press on as far as Tezpur in Assam, inflicting heavy casualties and humiliation on Indian troops. The Chinese eventually withdrew to what is now known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Nearly four decades later the area is still a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers. Confirmation of this came last Friday, when Arunachal Pradesh's chief minister, Mukut Mithi, alleged that Chinese troops had been making regular forays across the highly sensitive border. \"Maybe they have crossed the border without knowing where the LAC stands - but in any case this has to be stopped,\" he said. Over the weekend Mr Mithi escorted a party of journalists up to the Sino-Indian border to prove his point. He showed them what he said was a new Chinese-built mule trail in the Dibang valley district, and claimed that \"repeated incursions\" were taking place. \"Normally they come in the guise of graziers or hunters by encroaching on the LAC. Sometimes they claim that the land belongs to them,\" he said. Whether the incursions are genuine or imaginary, they speak volumes about the continuing mutual mistrust which exists between New Delhi and Beijing. India still lays claim to 40,000 sq kms (16,000 sq miles) of territory occupied by China in Kashmir, while China lays claim to a wide swathe of territory in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 650-mile border with China. Unlike the disputed border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, where rival troops shell each other every day, the Sino-Indian frontier does not ring with gunfire. Postal workers from both countries even exchange letters for villagers who live next to the LAC. China and India recently set up a working party to clarify the issue. But the tension continues: in 1986 the Red army allegedly constructed a helipad at the frontier, only for it to be demolished by Indian troops. On the diplomatic front, relations between Indian and China remain outwardly cordial. India's president paid a successful visit to Beijing earlier this year. China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, came to India in July. But there exists plenty of suspicion too, most of it concerning the nuclear issue. India continues to accuse China of helping its archrival Pakistan to acquire advanced nuclear missile technology. US intelligence and military sources confirm that Pakistan's nuclear programme is more advanced than India's because of assistance from China and North Korea. In 1998 India and Pakistan carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests. India's defence minister, George Fernandes, defended the action on the grounds that India faced a nuclear threat from China. Last month he announced that India's latest inter-continental missile, Agni III, would be ready for testing \"sooner than expected\". The missile has a range of 2,500kms - enough to hit targets in central China. In turn, the Chinese have complained of Indian navy patrols in the South China sea. Though India's relations with Pakistan dominate the attention of foreign policy analysts in the US and Europe, the country's relationship with China is in many ways more intriguing. And more complex. The two most challenging postings for Indian diplomats abroad are widely held to be Beijing and Islamabad. \"In the short term the problem is Pakistan,\" one diplomat said. \"But in the long term it is the Chinese we need to worry about.\" Email: luke.harding@theguardian.com Related special reports: India and Pakistan Pakistan Other articles: More articles by Luke Harding Useful links: Times of India Pakistan Today India Monitor CIA world factbook: India CIA world factbook: Pakistan South Asia citizens' network",

But in New Zealand, a piece of email spam has precipitated a fierce debate about the country's future that is troubling its Labour government.</p> <p>A 27-year-old Kiwi, Richard Poole, sent an email to some of the 600,000 New Zealanders who work abroad, urging them to donate NZ$30 (about \u00a38.50) for a newspaper advertisement calling for the country's leaders act on the issue of the 'lost generation' - young New Zealanders fleeing the country for better paid jobs in Australia, the US and the UK.</p> <p>More than 600 signatures were collected and placed in an advert in the New Zealand Herald. The ad blamed the Labour government's tax regime, union-boosting labour laws and \"flaky\" assistance for new businesses for the Kiwi brain drain. Hot on its heels came another full-page advert from an exiled tax accountant calling on the prime minister to make New Zealand's economy more enticing to foreign business.</p> <p>Claiming to be the non-political fears of twenty-somethings, the Poole email was exposed by the government as being backed by money from the Business Roundtable, a pro-business pressure group. Roundtable chief executive Roger Kerr has admitted his organisation paid NZ$10,000 (about \u00a32,800) for the ad up-front, while Poole collected his donations from the 600 signatories. Prime minister Helen Clark, believing it to be a business-led conspiracy against her government, has called for Kerr to be sacked.</p> <p>But the brain drain debate has been ignited. Reports of staff-starved institutions such as the NHS luring foreign professionals to the UK added fuel to the fire. With its weak currency and small economy, most New Zealanders can expect to earn 30% more in Australia, while anyone with decent IT skills is guaranteed a lucrative job almost anywhere.</p> <p>In the year to August, New Zealand had a net loss of 10,030 permanent migrants, 10% less than the previous year, but still significant to a country with a population of less than 4m people. The country is concerned that overseas experience - for years a rite of passage for many young New Zealanders - is becoming a more permanent venture than a mere six month globe-trotting trip. An increasing number spend most of their 20s away and, when they return to the southern hemisphere, choose to settle in Australia rather than New Zealand.</p> <p>Statistically, the New Zealand economy may not be damaged by the departures just yet, but with the anti-Labour business community and the opposition National Party seeking to extract political capital from the debate, it could segue into a critique of the Clark government's economic record.</p> <p>Poole's email and the controversy it has triggered is a facet of globalisation. Depopulation in the west is associated with the mass departures from Ireland in the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by famine and impoverishment. For developed countries, it is a relatively new phenomenon, brought about by the mobility of economic capital and the ability to fly around the world in 27 hours.</p> <p>Other modern economies are also falling victim to it, regardless of their government's political hue. More than 62,000 Canadians headed south last year, driven partly by the 95% of computer graduates who were gobbled up by American companies, resulting in a five-year high in emigration to the US.

Indeed, a conspiracy theorist might concoct a notion that a bunch of eco-terrorists had sabotaged sluice gates to ensure the scenes we've had of flooded fields and high streets turned to churning rivers \u00e0 la Mozambique. The timing is excellent. We are only a month away from the Hague convention on climate change when the promises of Kyoto are supposed to be nailed down, and there is a real danger that the convention will go belly-up, in large part owing to US truculence.</p> <p>Climate change induces a strange apathy. Everyone knows about it, few people do anything about it. If an environmentalist group launches a campaign to save a cuddly animal, it will get plenty of support, but only the really dedicated will write letters to their MP demanding a 20% cut in carbon emissions. An air of unreality has settled over the whole subject. Kyoto asked for cuts of 5% below 1990 levels, which the scientists assert is hopelessly inadequate. They say we need cuts of 60-80%.</p> <p>Yet even Kyoto may prove impossible. A decade after it was universally accepted that climate change was caused by carbon emissions, they are still rising. Not even scare stories seem to have had much effect. To cap it all, the fuel tax protest a month ago seemed the coup de grace, pre-empting the whole debate in the Hague. It could have been a textbook PR exercise on the part of the oil companies to demonstrate the power and stubbornness of the electorate: don't mess with our petrol.</p> <p>Just when it seemed that all was lost, rivers we had nearly forgotten about with richly redolent names such as the Beult, Uck, Ouse and Tiesse spring their wondrous revenge on our indifference. The rivers we had thought we had safely corralled proved our hubris. Seventeen severe flood warnings, 47 flood warnings, 97 flood watches: virtually the entire country was threatened by the worst floods in 40 years. The sense of outrage and anger from those affected suggested that we had forgotten that rivers flood. They always have done from time to time; what has changed is that they are now flooding frequently. We have to learn again the folk knowledge that was lost for a couple of generations about how rivers behave: where they flood, how they can suddenly rise and the destructive force of a river in spate. It was not for nothing that our ancestors worshipped water spirits; they knew their power, for creation and destruction.</p> <p>We lost this knowledge because we believed that such chances of nature could be ironed out by a combination of technology and government raising and applying the necessary revenue. Sue Tapsell, a fellow at Middlesex's Flood Hazard Research Centre, has done research on the impact of floods in County Durham and the Thames Valley; the common theme is the impulse to blame - it is someone's fault. What quickly follows is the angry comment of a man quoted last week who has been flooded three times this year: \"Something has got to be done.\" He is absolutely right. It has, but - here's the catch - it won't stop the floods. Even if we magically managed to cut our carbon emissions tomorrow, we will be reaping the results of the carbon we have already put into the atmosphere for generations to come. The consequences of all this for the faith and trust we have in government are legion - the environment does not pay dividends within an election cycle.</p> <p>The million-dollar question is how you close the gap between the angry \"something must be done\" and the dramatic shift in lifestyle and political priorities (investment in renewable energy before the NHS) that is necessary. Platform, a London-based group of activists and artists, advocates a process of reconnecting individuals and communities with their environment, which in cities is often buried under their feet. They have been running a campaign on London's rivers - Still Waters - many of which are no more than bricked over drains. On the river Wandle, a micro-hydroturbine powers some of the local primary school lights, and a bell is triggered on high tide.</p> <p>The task is herculean. Tapsell has done research with London schoolchildren on their attitudes to the countryside. Some had never been there; some didn't know what a river was; some said they'd prefer it if it was tidier and there were benches; some said the countryside scared them, they might be snatched by strangers or catch a disease. Country Life's survey of children's attitudes to the countryside last week revealed similar themes.</p> <p>One poignant comment indicated how regimented and confined is children's interaction with nature: \"You cannot sit on grass in case there are dog faeces.\" When Tapsell took a party of children to a river, they revelled in being allowed to get wet and muddy. Once it was in that intimate, intensely sensual experience of nature (on wasteland or in the countryside proper), that most children experienced their first taste of freedom. The exhilaration of building a den or climbing a tree is about escaping adult control. Our interaction with materials used to start with the mud and the puddles. Now it's in the hygienic playschool's water play. Somewhere along the line, we've lost the link between nature and freedom and drilled a fear of open spaces into children. They're relegated to the confines of the playground under a watchful eye, while the countryside is as real as video tape as it flashes past the car window.</p> <p>The twin principles which govern children's attitudes (and probably many of their parents) to the countryside are fear and sentimentalisation. Human life has never lasted so long, and never have so few lives been lost to accidents and serious illness in Britain, and yet we are more preoccupied than ever about preserving life and reducing risk. Partly in response to that sense of danger, we have constructed a children's entertainment industry predicated on airbrushing out the unpredictable brutality of nature: Bambi and Percy the Park-keeper. What help is the Jungle Book to the generation who will have to cope with more of the consequences of environmental degradation than ever before?</p> <p>The alternative, as environmental scientist James Lovelock has argued, is that we need a few really nasty shocks. If London, Hamburg or Washington DC were flooded, with a serious loss of life, we might finally start making connections between climate change and our unsustainable lifestyle. The problem about this argument is that by the time London floods, most of Bangladesh and the Nile delta will be long underwater.

The only major contemporary art space in Wales opened to a great fanfare in the Hayes shopping centre last summer. It was a converted Victorian library, but unlike the original institution it charged admission, and had a touchy-feely introduction to contemporary art for children on the top floor. It wanted to be the Millennium Dome and Tate Modern simultaneously, but had no chance of being either because its funding bodies - the Arts Council of Wales and the city council provided the bulk of the \u00a39m cost - expected the centre to make up a serious financial shortfall from admissions in its first year. The financial crisis at the end of 12 months was not merely predictable. It is almost as if it were planned in advance. The CVA is to close in its present form on November 5. </p> <p>Cardiff's political establishment went about the business of establishing the Centre so half-heartedly that it's hard to believe they wanted a modern art gallery at all. Instead of nurturing an audience for new art, the CVA acted as a proof to cultural conservatives that Welsh people don't want this modern art rubbish, see. </p> <p>Instead, Cardiff has a world-class rugby stadium. It also has the \u00a32bn Cardiff Bay Development - eventually to include an new cultural hub, the much-delayed Wales Millennium Centre - where the despised docklands have been turned into a genteel setting for businesses and fish restaurants. The aesthetics of the new Cardiff Bay, as with other waterfront reclamations from Sunderland to Liverpool to New York's Pier 17, are cosily retrograde. This kind of reclamation can create a pleasant setting for eating an ice cream. It cannot make a city feel like a city. </p> <p>Cities are cultural entities. The texture of social and economic life in them is defined by their cultural energy or lack of it, and cities all over the world - Glasgow, Barcelona, Seattle - have demonstrated that by changing the way their cultural life is perceived you can change everything about them. The problem is that culture is not something that can be neatly delivered from above. It cannot - as the Welsh critic Raymond Williams argued, because it is complex and living. When city authorities - and in the case of Cardiff, national governments - try to regenerate a city by mixing up architectural, artistic and leisure projects, the results can be catastrophic. Sheffield ends up with a National Centre for Popular Music (aka the Unpopular Centre for National Music) whose shiny Nigel Coates design cannot conceal the poverty of its displays; Newcastle gets a vast, pointless life-science centre; Greenwich gets the Dome. </p> <p>What these follies have in common is a patronising conception of popular culture. The question, as city after city tries to turn itself into a hip, swinging cultural metropolis, is what kind of culture do you want and why? To a city like Cardiff, the answer appears to be popular, mainstream culture. So opera was out, and contemporary art is out. Rugby is in. But what Cardiff's Taffia has done is to impose a boring cultural stereotype on the city, and on Wales, and then to build monuments to this stereotype. As a strategy for urban cultural regeneration, this is a disaster. Cardiff feels small - it is, with a population of 320,000 - and parochial. It has the commercial and leisure venues you see all over Britain. But this does not add up to any sense of metropolitan energy. </p> <p>Architecture in Wales means, for many people, medieval castles perched on rocky crags over slate-built towns. The castles built by the English in the 14th century are architectural masterpieces - dense, raw structures that still speak of power. The problem for Wales is that there is no metropolitan tradition to compare with these rustic ruins. The urbanisation of south Wales only happened in the 19th century and a country that had always had a tiny population scattered across small towns and hamlets never really got used to the idea of the big city. Swansea, with its mid-20th-century cultural scene, was perhaps the closest to a Glasgow or Dublin - but Dylan Thomas spent his final days in faraway New York. </p> <p>The Welsh have built towns that seem makeshift and frightened compared to the looming mountains. The interior world of the home has been valued more than public space; the national imagination is rooted in the village. For all these reasons, Cardiff's culture has shied away from the metropolitan and expressed itself until recently in a flight to the suburbs. That's why \"cultural regeneration\" has become necessary, with the Cardiff Bay scheme - including the construction of a \u00a3200m barrage to control tidal levels and the opening up of waterfront spaces for development - and the Millennium Stadium attempting to lure money into the city centre. </p> <p>In too many cities in Britain the bright, shiny dream of \"cultural regeneration\" has been pursued without the courage to believe in culture at all. What is most wrong is the assumption that a cultural project in a city has to fit in with what is already there. Sheffield thought it was a pop city (The Human League! Jarvis!); Cardiff thinks it is Rugby Central. But where cities have exploded into cultural life it has been a surprise. Glasgow's 1980s literary scene and cur rent art scene had nothing in common with the way the city had always been imagined. </p> <p>Good art is serious and difficult. It does not confirm what you already know. This is why so many of the new cultural spaces and projects in cities across Britain just turn into samey exercises of less interest than the opening of a new multiplex.

      "body": "<p>The improbable story - part fantasy, part fairy tale - goes something like this. As a teenager, I saw a film that entranced me. The plot was simple: it's Prohibition time and two unemployed jazz musicians (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) are chance witnesses of the Chicago Saint Valentine's Day massacre. Pursued by the mob, they make a rapid escape by disguising themselves as women and joining Sweet Sue and her Syncopaters all-girl band. Almost 20 years later, I abandoned my home and young daughter, hitched up my caravan and ran away to join an Italian circus.</p> <p>It may be crude to claim I became a circus showgirl because of Some Like It Hot, even though by the time I reached Italy I had seen it more than 20 times. At a gala premiere last week of the new print made for cinema release, film critic Barry Norman declared Marilyn Monroe the undisputed star of the film; without this frothy vision of loveliness, it would be just another 1950s romantic comedy.</p> <p>But even watching it today, I barely notice Monroe. It's Curtis and Lemmon - Josephine and Daphne - who hold me. They taught me what it meant to be a woman. They still do.</p> <p>I was 18 when I first saw the film. Then an androgynous student, my uniform was dungarees and a short dark crop, rather like Lemmon's. Some Like It Hot seemed to put forward a thesis that reinforced the lessons of my Edinburgh University Women's Group. Women don't exist, they are created. Anyone can become one.</p> <p>It was many years before I put that lesson into practice. I tried Biba blue eyeshadow, a blonde bob and skimpy Lycra dresses at mid-80s discos. Later I attempted, but never got a grip on, foundation cream and underwired bras. But the circus offered a chance truly to transform. In the ring, the extremities of womanhood could be acted out as in no other place.</p> <p>I chose an Italian circus because I knew that, so far from home, I could not be unmasked. If I had joined Billy Smart's, touring Britain, someone who knew me might turn up in the audience and my deception would be discovered. \"She's not a showgirl,\" they'd shout. \"She's just Dea Birkett in a sequined G-string. She's a fake,\" not realising fakery was my purpose.</p> <p>In the 1959 film, we never see how Curtis and Lemmon become women. One minute they're in jacket and trousers, the next in lipstick and stockings. The only time male and female mix is when Lemmon is dressed as Daphne, all made-up but without his wig. It's a disconcerting moment. He's neither male nor female; it's as if he's deciding which he will become. There's a knock on the door. He pulls on his wig. We are relieved. We're in safe - all-female - territory again, sure of where and what we are.</p> <p>Yet it is the transformation, rather than the finished product, that is the most crucial element. It is also the most secret. Women rarely put on make-up in front of men. It's important to perpetuate the deceit that our femininity isn't a construction at all - we were born that way.</p> <p>In the circus showgirl's dressing room - an old railway carriage - no men were allowed. One wall was lined with lockers containing everything we needed to become a woman: scant sequined costumes, impossibly long wigs, piles of putty-coloured tights. The other was nothing but mirrors. We could watch ourselves being transformed.</p> <p>First we had to strip, shed any remnant of who we were. \"Ignore your face,\" said the Bulgarian elephant girl, watching me trace liner around my thin lips. \"This has nothing to do with what you're like. You can be anything. Just paint on the face you want.\"</p> <p>She guided me through the steps to becoming a showgirl. My pale skin became a yellowed tan. My poppy eyes were made almond-shaped by cats' whiskers drawn from the corners. My thin eyebrows were thickened; false eyelashes were applied. My lips were full and pouting, my short hair hidden under a tight skullcap, topped with ostrich feathers exploding from a diamant\u00e9 crown.</p> <p>And yet, despite the immense effort, it was a fragile disguise. A tender finger traced across my cheek and my artifice would fall apart.</p> <p>Next, attention had to be paid to my body. My legs were squeezed into three pairs of tights, each more supportive than the last, until they curved where they had bulged and were smooth where they had been dimpled. These were topped with fishnets. Becoming a woman wasn't easy. It took a full two hours to get ready for just five minutes in the ring.</p> <p>Everything about me was indelibly dated: the tan of my foundation, the spidery false eyelashes, the dark beige fishnets. I could have been in a 1950s film. I could have been in Some Like It Hot. But even contemporary female impersonators - Edna Everidge, Lily Savage, Mrs Merton - portray women rarely, if ever, still seen on the street.</p> <p>It wasn't only how I looked that had to be altered - how I moved had to be learned. Lemmon, as Daphne failing to conquer high heels, describes women's movements as: \"Jello on springs ... Is there some sort of motor or something?\" adding wryly: \"I tell you, it's a whole different sex.\"</p> <p>I had to learn to keep my mouth open as I smiled and waved, to show the white of my teeth. My chest and bottom had to be thrust out, making my arched body an S. Gallina, the Russian Hula Hoop artiste, used to practise smiling and waving in the dressing room mirror before she went on, greeting her own reflection as if seeing it for the first time.</p> <p>Some friends were appalled that I had abandoned my androgynous attire to become a showgirl, conniving in such sexist posturing. But we all, in little ways, contrive at being female. We try out being femme, put on a dress when we rarely wear one, perm and dye our hair, and stand in front of a full-length mirror, wondering at ourselves. We've been doing it since we were small girls. Because that is what being a woman is all about, making yourself up as one.</p> <p>I was playing at being a woman. Becoming a showgirl just threw that make-believe into sharp relief because it was so blatant. I was exposing the construction of femininity, not conforming to it. I was as subversive as Jack Lemmon playing Daphne.</p> <p>And still now, watching Some Like It Hot in my combats, with a can of Carlsberg, legs akimbo on the sofa, I long to return to the circus.

      "bodyText": "Favourite new album: Kid A - and not just because Radiohead has banished corporate sponsorship from their tour, although I think its incredibly cool for a band to reclaim some unbranded cultural space for their fans. Favourite new band: Dead Prez, from Brooklyn. Favourite television programme: The Daily Show - you don't get this brilliant news satire in the UK, tragically. Favourite documentary (besides the one on Channel 4 tomorrow night): This Is What Democracy Looks Like, produced by the Independent Media Centre. It will be coming to Britain soon. This is the first work to capture the energy of the camcorder activists. It is the story of the anti-World Trade Organisation protests in Seattle cut together with footage from 100 video cameras. Least favourite magazine: The Economist. They are on a mission to misrepresent the anti-corporate protesters as greedy rich kids who want to take food out, the mouths of the world's hungry. Why is it so very difficult to imagine that political alliances can cross borders as easily as Nike trainers and foreign currency? Scariest new website: www.chrisandluke.com. This is a site built by two brothers who want to be \"the first sponsored college students.\" They are looking for corporations to give them money in exchange for advertising on their bodies - sort of like racing car drivers and rock stars. Favourite website: www.openletters.net: \"A daily magazine of first person writing in the form of personal correspondence.\" One letter is posted per day on topics ranging from being the most popular girl at school, to what it's like to interview for a job at Microsoft. All that unites the letters is the intimacy of the writing. Best new media device: I don't do product endorsements - at least not for free. \u0095 Naomi Klein is the author of No Logo. Her 24-minute film on brands and the anti-capitalist movement will be shown on Channel 4 News tomorrow night.",

No star name and billion-dollar bank account will get you a ticket to Maja Vallis or Tritonis Lacus for the spring of 2003. There is, however, one man who is going. A man convinced that, when the early sun begins to warm the rusty flood channels of Chryse and the dusty expanse of the Elysium plains, he and his team will be exploring them. His name is Colin Pillinger, and he works in Milton Keynes. </p> <p>This spring is not on Earth, and much as he would love to be, Pillinger is not going to be there in person. What he is attempting to do is almost as extraordinary: pull together a diffuse group of scientists and engineers, on a wee budget and a tight timescale, to build the first British spacecraft to land on another planet. That, and answer a question which has bothered us for a few hundred years: is there life on Mars? </p> <p>Pillinger, professor of planetary sciences at the Open University, believes the Mars lander he is building, Beagle 2, will be able to sniff out the evidence of life, if there is any to be found. But Beagle, on board the European Space Agency mission Mars Express, will not be alone. The vessel of a richer, older space power, Nasa, will be cruising through space hard on the heels of Mars Express, with its own, more expensive and elaborate set of landers - the Athena project - on board. A race has begun. </p> <p>The public face of space science tends to be all smiles and friendship between nations. But Pillinger has been making some distinctly undiplomatic remarks in public about the virtues of his budget Beagle against the $400m (\u00a3272m) Athena, which will consist of two labs mounted on wheels, able to roam across the Martian surface. (Accounts of the cost of Beagle range from a 10th of this to a third, if you include the whole Mars Express mission.) </p> <p>Pillinger's most scathing remarks came at the British Association science festival last month, when he said: \"Athena has what I believe to be an inferior package of scientific instruments to search for life.\" It was a bold attack, and a hostage to fortune. \"It was an entirely valid criticism delivered in the way I delivered it, when I was supposed to be saying what was good about British science,\" he says now. \"I wouldn't want to labour the point.\" But he won't withdraw it, either. He is disappointed by his rival's tactics, which he says will only yield measurements indirectly showing the existence of water, a prerequisite for life. Beagle will directly sample the air, rocks and soil for carbon compounds which are the products and components of life. </p> <p>\"It's very difficult to see how [Athena] is going to further our study of Mars,\" Pillinger says. \"They're going to show they have the technical ability to move around the planet but it isn't going to look for life.\" </p> <p>Pillinger's opposite number on the other side of the Atlantic, Steven Squyres of Cornell University, is too courteous to admit to anything so crude as rivalry. But it would lead to some heavy angst at Nasa, with 35 years of missions to Mars to its credit, if a small country with a minimal track record in space managed to land a probe on the planet first time, and then announced to the world it had solved the mystery of whether it hosted life. </p> <p>Nasa's history of successful Mars missions has been interspersed with so many disasters that as far back as 1969 a Nasa scientist wondered if there wasn't a \"galactic ghoul\" standing sentinel over our neighbour in space. Last year was so calamitous the agency had to rethink its whole programme: a Mars climate surveyor was lost because the engineers who built it mixed up metric and imperial measurements, and two months later a polar lander vanished without trace after starting its descent to the surface. </p> <p>Which is why, of course, Squyres - who was involved in both missions - thinks Nasa should be taking it slow, careful and long. And why, perhaps, Pillinger might have bitten off a teeny bit more than he can chew. </p> <p>\"The nice thing about our programme is it really is a programme. It's not just one mission,\" Squyres says pointedly. \"We did Mars Pathfinder (a successful mission) for a very low cost. Then we went back and did two missions for less than the cost of Pathfinder, and they both failed. The lesson we drew from that is that if you push too hard in terms of faster, better, cheaper, you have failed missions.\" </p> <p>Squyres' point is that Nasa's rovers are scouts for other US missions to come, which will be more focused on the search for life. \"We're not carrying biological instrumentation,\" he admits. \"Our mission has a different focus.\" </p> <p>Can Pillinger pull it off? \"The Europeans aren't overreaching themselves by identifying something which is a key objective and going for it,\" says Andr\u00e9 Balogh, professor of space physics at Imperial College in London. \"The Europeans can make a difference if - and it is a big if - Mars Express works. It remains a relatively high-risk project.\" </p> <p>Squyres and Pillinger have never met. The American is younger - 44 to Pillinger's 57. Squyres grew up in a science family in Winona, New Jersey; his father had a chemistry doctorate from MIT. Pillinger, from Kingswood on the outskirts of Bristol, declines to talk about his childhood. But there is a symmetry. Both men went into science - Squyres into geology, Pillinger chemistry - with no clear idea of where they were going, only to be touched by the lure of space early on. </p> <p>With Squyres, it was being taught as a student in the 1970s by a scientist who had worked on the Viking Mars landers. \"As I got deeper into geology, I concluded there wasn't that much more real exploring to be done on Earth,\" he says. \"I was captivated by the idea of being able to explore other worlds.\" </p> <p>Just out of his postgraduate training, Pillinger was taken on by Bristol University in 1969 to analyse fragments of lunar rock from the Apollo missions. It was the start of a career which saw him become one of the world's leading experts on moon rocks and Martian meteorites, chips of Mars which were sent flying into space after an asteroid collided with that planet and which ended up bumping into Earth. </p> <p>\"It was good to go out at night and look at the moon and be able to say: 'I work on that,' \" he says. </p> <p>While Squyres was taken up rapidly into Nasa's sprawling space science establishment, Pillinger remained confined to earthly labs for decades. When in 1997 ESA began canvassing missions for Mars Express, he seized his chance. </p> <p>Brushing aside the doubts of the European space bureaucracy about whether money could be found for a lander, he convinced them he would raise the funds himself. So Beagle 2 was born, funded by British universities and businesses, a sceptical government and a band of as yet unrevealed sponsors being corralled by Saatchi and Saatchi. </p> <p>If all goes according to plan, around Christmas 2003, Beagle will separate from the Mars Express orbiter, descend to the planet by parachute and bounce to a halt in a coccoon of gas bags. A clamshell shield will unfold, exposing Beagle's scientific instruments, and the lander will beam back to Earth a Blur track specially composed for the event. Beagle's cameras will be calibrated by filming an image of coloured spots provided by Damien Hirst. If nothing else, Britscience is putting the first and probably last Britpop and Britart on Mars. </p> <p>A few days later, the first Athena lander will drop onto another part of the planet. Given past experience, the odds are poor that Beagle and Athena will both perform flawlessly. It would be an extraordinary coup for Pillinger if a working British Beagle was merrily scratching and sniffing around in the Martian dirt when Nasa arrived. It would be a profound personal blow if something went wrong. </p> <p>\"Beagle 2 is very much Colin Pillinger's baby, and he has very much put himself on the line,\" says Balogh. \"He's got an extremely distinguished background in analysing meteorites in the laboratory. This is a big departure for him. </p> <p>\"He's in a fairly exposed position. But I think that without people like him, science doesn't necessarily advance at anything but a pedestrian level.\" </p> <p>Pillinger is aware of the risks. \"It's ever so easy to land on Mars on paper,\" he says. \"My answer is we've recruited what we think are the best possible players in Europe. We believe we have a strong, substantial team.\" </p> <p>Speculation about whether life exists on Mars has been going on since the 17th century. No matter how many disappointments there have been - confirmation by the Mariner probes in the 1960s that Mars was a frigid desert with a thin atmosphere, the lack of evidence for life found by the Viking landers in the 1970s - there is an overwhelming desire on the part of humankind to believe we are not alone in the solar system. </p> <p>The announcement in 1996 that researchers had found fossilised life in one of the Martian meteorites which fell to Earth received much greater attention than the subsequent chorus of scientific criticism saying the \"fossils\" were, in fact, natural geological features. </p> <p>There is always a suspicion that space scientists cynically play up the chances of finding life on Mars or the Jovian moons to drum up public support, and hence funding, for their programmes - even when they don't, in their hearts, have any hope that life is there. </p> <p>It seems to be another thing that Squyres and Pillinger have in common that they aren't like that. They both insist they will wait for the data to come in. But it is clear that they wouldn't be so interested in Mars if they were sure, personally, that the rocks were dead. </p> <p>\"One of the things that makes Mars a special place is the fact that it is so Earthlike, and the possibility that life must have arisen there,\" says said Squyres. \"It's very hard to prove the negative, that there is no life.\" </p> <p>Pillinger thinks the jury is still out on what the meteorites show. He is convinced that the \"fossils\" show evidence of water flow and carbon compounds, the building blocks of life. Beagle has to prove that the carbon compounds are native to Mars, rather than being the results of contamination of the meteorites, and to see what else it can find - like methane in the Martian atmosphere, which would be as clear an indicator of life as a sign in Maja Vallis saying: \"Mars Welcomes Careful Landers.\" </p> <p>If Squyres sees himself as an explorer, Pillinger is more of a sleuth. \"At the beginning analysing extraterrestrial rocks turned out to be the job I was offered, but there were times when I could have said I'd like to do forensic science. Detective stuff,\" he says. \"Working with extraterrestrial samples is like that. You don't have the clues in front of you. You have to use your ingenuity to find them.\"</p>",

But there is a symmetry. Both men went into science - Squyres into geology, Pillinger chemistry - with no clear idea of where they were going, only to be touched by the lure of space early on. With Squyres, it was being taught as a student in the 1970s by a scientist who had worked on the Viking Mars landers. \"As I got deeper into geology, I concluded there wasn't that much more real exploring to be done on Earth,\" he says. \"I was captivated by the idea of being able to explore other worlds.\" Just out of his postgraduate training, Pillinger was taken on by Bristol University in 1969 to analyse fragments of lunar rock from the Apollo missions. It was the start of a career which saw him become one of the world's leading experts on moon rocks and Martian meteorites, chips of Mars which were sent flying into space after an asteroid collided with that planet and which ended up bumping into Earth. \"It was good to go out at night and look at the moon and be able to say: 'I work on that,' \" he says. While Squyres was taken up rapidly into Nasa's sprawling space science establishment, Pillinger remained confined to earthly labs for decades. When in 1997 ESA began canvassing missions for Mars Express, he seized his chance. Brushing aside the doubts of the European space bureaucracy about whether money could be found for a lander, he convinced them he would raise the funds himself. So Beagle 2 was born, funded by British universities and businesses, a sceptical government and a band of as yet unrevealed sponsors being corralled by Saatchi and Saatchi. If all goes according to plan, around Christmas 2003, Beagle will separate from the Mars Express orbiter, descend to the planet by parachute and bounce to a halt in a coccoon of gas bags. A clamshell shield will unfold, exposing Beagle's scientific instruments, and the lander will beam back to Earth a Blur track specially composed for the event. Beagle's cameras will be calibrated by filming an image of coloured spots provided by Damien Hirst. If nothing else, Britscience is putting the first and probably last Britpop and Britart on Mars. A few days later, the first Athena lander will drop onto another part of the planet. Given past experience, the odds are poor that Beagle and Athena will both perform flawlessly. It would be an extraordinary coup for Pillinger if a working British Beagle was merrily scratching and sniffing around in the Martian dirt when Nasa arrived. It would be a profound personal blow if something went wrong. \"Beagle 2 is very much Colin Pillinger's baby, and he has very much put himself on the line,\" says Balogh. \"He's got an extremely distinguished background in analysing meteorites in the laboratory. This is a big departure for him. \"He's in a fairly exposed position. But I think that without people like him, science doesn't necessarily advance at anything but a pedestrian level.\" Pillinger is aware of the risks. \"It's ever so easy to land on Mars on paper,\" he says. \"My answer is we've recruited what we think are the best possible players in Europe. We believe we have a strong, substantial team.\" Speculation about whether life exists on Mars has been going on since the 17th century. No matter how many disappointments there have been - confirmation by the Mariner probes in the 1960s that Mars was a frigid desert with a thin atmosphere, the lack of evidence for life found by the Viking landers in the 1970s - there is an overwhelming desire on the part of humankind to believe we are not alone in the solar system. The announcement in 1996 that researchers had found fossilised life in one of the Martian meteorites which fell to Earth received much greater attention than the subsequent chorus of scientific criticism saying the \"fossils\" were, in fact, natural geological features. There is always a suspicion that space scientists cynically play up the chances of finding life on Mars or the Jovian moons to drum up public support, and hence funding, for their programmes - even when they don't, in their hearts, have any hope that life is there. It seems to be another thing that Squyres and Pillinger have in common that they aren't like that. They both insist they will wait for the data to come in. But it is clear that they wouldn't be so interested in Mars if they were sure, personally, that the rocks were dead. \"One of the things that makes Mars a special place is the fact that it is so Earthlike, and the possibility that life must have arisen there,\" says said Squyres. \"It's very hard to prove the negative, that there is no life.\" Pillinger thinks the jury is still out on what the meteorites show. He is convinced that the \"fossils\" show evidence of water flow and carbon compounds, the building blocks of life. Beagle has to prove that the carbon compounds are native to Mars, rather than being the results of contamination of the meteorites, and to see what else it can find - like methane in the Martian atmosphere, which would be as clear an indicator of life as a sign in Maja Vallis saying: \"Mars Welcomes Careful Landers.\" If Squyres sees himself as an explorer, Pillinger is more of a sleuth. \"At the beginning analysing extraterrestrial rocks turned out to be the job I was offered, but there were times when I could have said I'd like to do forensic science. Detective stuff,\" he says. \"Working with extraterrestrial samples is like that. You don't have the clues in front of you. You have to use your ingenuity to find them.\"",

Financial deregulation and capital liberalisation - forced down the throats of other nations by the US treasury and Wall Street - may not look quite so clever when the hot money flows into America are reversed, bringing down the dollar and adding to inflationary pressure. </p> <p> We could, therefore, stand on the threshold of a new age of crisis. In years to come, we may look back on the last years of the 1990s as a brief oasis of prosperity in a desert of economic dislocation. However, let's try to look on the bright side. An alternative way of looking at recent events is to see them as a catharsis, with a crash on Wall Street not just the culmination of the financial turmoil that started in south-east Asia three years ago but the final thunderous chords of a symphony of darkness stretching back to the mid-1970s. Seen in this light, the trouble in the Middle East would not be the overture to a new crisis, but a coda to the last. </p> <p> One important reason for optimism is that we now live in a disinflationary age. In Britain, even after almost nine years of economic growth, we have car makers cutting prices, the Halifax offering higher rates of interest to its borrowers, supermarkets involved in a price war. This is not just the consequence of a strong pound, even though the reduction in the cost of imports caused by sterling's rise have been a factor. Competitive pressures, consumer resistance to higher prices and higher investment in new technology has changed the rules of the game and made the west less vulnerable to higher oil prices than it was in the 1970s. </p> <p>This point was made forcefully last week by Sushil Wadhwani, one of the nine members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Taking advantage of the fact that the four \"outsiders\" on the MPC can now call on their own team of researchers, Mr Wadhwani has come up with some fascinating - if still tentative conclusions. </p> <p> Firstly, he says that the trade-off between growth and inflation has improved in the past decade, with forecasters underestimating growth and overestimating inflation. These errors have been considerable - around 0.5% a year in the case of both growth and inflation. Globalisation has been one factor in putting downward pressure on prices but privatisation and tougher regulation have led to a much tougher competitive environment. </p> <p> Mr Wadhwani says it is possible that \"the tendency to over-predict inflation is related to not paying enough attention to the possibility that the intensification of product market pressure has been altering some of the relationships built into existing macroeconometric models\". Including, presumably, the Bank's. </p> <p> But if firms are being skewered by an intensification of product market competition, why is it that profit margins are broadly unchanged since the start of the 1990s? Mr Wadhwani says that there are conditions in which the profit share would remain constant even with an increase in competition - a weakening of the power of labour or a technology-driven increase in productivity growth where the gains were disproportionately captured by capital. Like many other economists, Mr Wadhwani is convinced that the balance of power in the labour market has been profoundly affected by curbs on unions and tighter benefit rules. As a result, the old equations determining wages are now out of date, with the actual level of earnings growth coming in lower than expected. </p> <p> But it is the final part of the analysis which breaks new ground and is likely to cause most debate within the MPC. Mr Wadhwani argues that the increase in the capacity of the economy in the past decade may not have been picked up by official data. He says that using the stock of capital to measure the supply potential of the economy is difficult, and that too much emphasis may have been placed on fixed assets such as building and not enough on short-lived assets such as machinery, equipment and software, where growth rates have been much more rapid. </p> <p> Comparisons between UK and US prices for computers and software suggest, according to Mr Wadhwani, that inflation in new technology has been overstated and volume growth understated. He points out that in the US, software investment has averaged 140% of computer investment, in the UK it has been only 39%. Unless computers are being used as ornaments, this would appear to be highly unlikely. Working on the assumption that investment in software has been unrecorded and actually represents the same proportion of GDP in Britain as in the US, Mr Wadhwani and one of his researchers, Nicholas Oulton, found that growth would have been almost 0.4% a year higher between 1994 and 1998. Such a finding would, of course, have knock-on effects on productivity, unit labour costs and inflation and help to explain why the improvement in the growth-inflation trade-off has not been picked up. </p> <p> Mr Wadhwani's analysis is bound to raise a few eyebrows on the MPC. With oil prices rising and the claimant count measure of unemployment below 4%, there will certainly be those warning that there is a risk to inflation of leaving monetary policy too loose, particularly if the crutch of a high pound is knocked away. But he is right to point out the risks in the other direction. In the medium term an improvement in the growth-inflation trade-off could - with the right policy response - herald the start of a new golden age of full employment. But not if policy makers insist on fighting the battles of the past. Inflation in the UK excluding oil and petrol is 1.6% and prices of goods in the high street are falling. Japanese inflation is negative. There is little price pressure in Germany, and not a great deal - given the strength of the booming economy in the US. The immediate threat to the west may be inflation; the spectre in the shadows is deflation. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a> </p>",

      "body": "<p>The Tories could be on course to have more women elected as new MPs at the next general election than the Labour party, a prospect that will severely embarrass Downing Street.</p> <p>An analysis of parliamentary selection lists for the two parties shows William Hague could be joined by six new Tory women MPs, a net gain of five. Labour, by contrast, is heading for only two new women MPs, a net loss of four.</p> <p>The pattern is repeated among candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds. The Tories are fielding 12 Asian candidates, compared with three new Asian candidates for Labour.

      "bodyText": "The Tories could be on course to have more women elected as new MPs at the next general election than the Labour party, a prospect that will severely embarrass Downing Street. An analysis of parliamentary selection lists for the two parties shows William Hague could be joined by six new Tory women MPs, a net gain of five. Labour, by contrast, is heading for only two new women MPs, a net loss of four. The pattern is repeated among candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds. The Tories are fielding 12 Asian candidates, compared with three new Asian candidates for Labour. At least one is likely to be elected for each party. Labour's selection of a handful of women was condemned last night by Harriet Harman, the former social security secretary. \"We seem to have taken two steps back after the step forward we took at the last election,\" she said. \"The system is unfair and unbalanced and must be changed because women in the country want to see more women MPs.\" Tessa Jowell, the women's minister, admitted Labour was deeply unhappy with the figures. \"We are in a very disappointing position,\" she said. Her remarks underlined the embarrassment at Labour's Millbank headquarters at the party's failure to select women for winnable seats. The party, whose all-women shortlists were blocked in 1996, has instructed local associations to ensure all shortlists have equal numbers of men and women. But this policy appears to have had barely any impact, judging by an analysis of Labour's preliminary candidates' list. Only two women have been selected so far in the 32 Labour-held seats up for grabs, marking a net loss of four because six of the 32 seats were occupied by women. Labour has yet to select a further six seats on the list, which means there is a last chance for more women to be chosen. Tony Blair responded to the growing anger in the party over selections by announcing at the Labour conference that he will consider legalising all-women shortlists if he wins the election. But Ms Harman said the party should take action by ensuring women are selected for the \"last-minute\" seats likely to become vacant a few months before the election. \"The leadership can use the last-minute selections to make up some of the ground we have lost,\" she said. \"They can draw up the shortlists for such seats to ensure that women are selected.\" The Tories are pleased that they are on course to have more new female MPs elected than Labour. Six new Tory MPs will be elected if there is a 3.35% swing to the party, with the numbers doubling to 12 on a 5.8% swing.

Mr Arafat came to the gate of the compound to explain his decision to the 200-strong crowd.</p> <p>\"We are going to Sharm el-Sheik, but taking with us the condition of the Palestinian people,\" he said. \"We are on the way to Jerusalem until a Palestinian child raises the Palestinian flag on the walls of Jerusalem.\"</p> <p>The crowd cheered, chanting: \"With our blood, and with our soul, we will defend you.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Mahdi Abdul Hadi, a Palestinian analyst, said: \"Our blood is still fresh in the street, we are in a state of mourning, there are black flags on our houses. We have awakened all the horses in the Arab world. Why should Arafat turn up alone, and on a donkey? Why should we go to a summit whose main purpose is to save Barak?\"</p> <p>Mr Barak also has precious little room for manoeuvre, having opened negotiations with the rightwing Likud party to form an emergency government, an act that would definitively kill off the peace process.</p> <p>Yesterday, Likud leaders said they would stay out if Mr Barak attempted to restart negotiations with Mr Arafat at today's summit.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister's demands, which were announced yesterday, reflect that hardening of positions. They include: an immediate end to the violence; the rearrest of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants released at the weekend; punishment for Palestinian police and members of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation who opened fire on Israeli soldiers; censorship of the Palestinian media, whom the Israelis accuse of inciting the violence; and preservation of Jewish pilgrimage sites at Nablus and Jericho, which have been attacked by Palestinians.</p> <p>Mr Arafat met one condition by putting 34 Hamas militants back in jail.</p> <p>However, he issued demands of his own: for Israel to withdraw its forces from the outskirts of Palestinian cities, and to end the closure of the West Bank and Gaza which has cut people off from the jobs in Israel that are the lifeline of the local economy. Mr Arafat also wants an international protection force, which Israel will certainly reject, and an international investigation into the violence, the demand that scuppered the last attempt to broker a ceasefire.</p> <p>\"I honestly don't want to raise anyone's expectations and I don't have high expectations myself,\" said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator. \"I think the situation is going to be nightmarish.\"</p> <p>President Clinton's challenge now will be to reconcile those opposing demands, especially the divisions over the call for an international in quiry which wrecked the summit in Paris between Mr Barak and Mr Arafat.</p> <p>If he fails, he risks the implosion of his Middle East diplomacy in the runup to the US presidential election on November 7, and the disastrous consequences from a unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence, on November 15 or later.</p> <p>On Saturday, Mr Clinton expressed deep regret that the peace process he has nurtured throughout his presidency has all but collapsed. \"We've had this terrible turn of events in the Middle East, which has really been heartbreaking for me,\" he said. \"I've seen so much progress in the last seven and a half years, so it's been very painful.\"</p> <p><b>Big names at the talks</b></p> <p>The main participants in the summit at Sharm el-Sheikh today are likely to be:</p> <p><b> Bill Clinton</b> US president</p> <p><b> Ehud Barak</b> Israeli prime minister</p> <p><b> Yasser Arafat</b> Palestinian president</p> <p><b> Hosni Mubarak</b> Egyptian president</p> <p><b> King Abdullah </b> of Jordan</p> <p><b> Kofi Annan</b> UN secretary general</p> <p><b> Javier Solana</b> EU foreign policy chief</p>",

Palestinian gunmen fired automatic rifles into the air outside Mr Arafat's office in Gaza last night to express their opposition. Mr Arafat came to the gate of the compound to explain his decision to the 200-strong crowd. \"We are going to Sharm el-Sheik, but taking with us the condition of the Palestinian people,\" he said. \"We are on the way to Jerusalem until a Palestinian child raises the Palestinian flag on the walls of Jerusalem.\" The crowd cheered, chanting: \"With our blood, and with our soul, we will defend you.\" Earlier, Mahdi Abdul Hadi, a Palestinian analyst, said: \"Our blood is still fresh in the street, we are in a state of mourning, there are black flags on our houses. We have awakened all the horses in the Arab world. Why should Arafat turn up alone, and on a donkey? Why should we go to a summit whose main purpose is to save Barak?\" Mr Barak also has precious little room for manoeuvre, having opened negotiations with the rightwing Likud party to form an emergency government, an act that would definitively kill off the peace process. Yesterday, Likud leaders said they would stay out if Mr Barak attempted to restart negotiations with Mr Arafat at today's summit. The Israeli prime minister's demands, which were announced yesterday, reflect that hardening of positions. They include: an immediate end to the violence; the rearrest of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants released at the weekend; punishment for Palestinian police and members of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation who opened fire on Israeli soldiers; censorship of the Palestinian media, whom the Israelis accuse of inciting the violence; and preservation of Jewish pilgrimage sites at Nablus and Jericho, which have been attacked by Palestinians. Mr Arafat met one condition by putting 34 Hamas militants back in jail. However, he issued demands of his own: for Israel to withdraw its forces from the outskirts of Palestinian cities, and to end the closure of the West Bank and Gaza which has cut people off from the jobs in Israel that are the lifeline of the local economy. Mr Arafat also wants an international protection force, which Israel will certainly reject, and an international investigation into the violence, the demand that scuppered the last attempt to broker a ceasefire. \"I honestly don't want to raise anyone's expectations and I don't have high expectations myself,\" said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator. \"I think the situation is going to be nightmarish.\" President Clinton's challenge now will be to reconcile those opposing demands, especially the divisions over the call for an international in quiry which wrecked the summit in Paris between Mr Barak and Mr Arafat. If he fails, he risks the implosion of his Middle East diplomacy in the runup to the US presidential election on November 7, and the disastrous consequences from a unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence, on November 15 or later. On Saturday, Mr Clinton expressed deep regret that the peace process he has nurtured throughout his presidency has all but collapsed. \"We've had this terrible turn of events in the Middle East, which has really been heartbreaking for me,\" he said. \"I've seen so much progress in the last seven and a half years, so it's been very painful.\" Big names at the talks The main participants in the summit at Sharm el-Sheikh today are likely to be: Bill Clinton US president Ehud Barak Israeli prime minister Yasser Arafat Palestinian president Hosni Mubarak Egyptian president King Abdullah of Jordan Kofi Annan UN secretary general Javier Solana EU foreign policy chief",

      "byline": "Mark Lawson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the first episode of the third series of The Royle Family (tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1) was recorded, its opening dialogue must have seemed merely a little jokey nip at the feeding hand. Watching BBC1, Jim Royle complains that \"it's all shite\" and the family are \"going to have to get Sky\". </p> <p>Now Caroline Aherne's comedy forms, along with the final series of One Foot in the Grave (tonight, 9pm, BBC1), an emergency scheduling bridgehead before the first BBC News (tonight, 10pm, BBC1) to be transmitted in the old ITN News At Ten slot. In short, Jim Royle is charged with preventing the BBC1 audience from deciding it's all shite and buying Sky. </p> <p>The only television comedy in which the dialogue is almost wholly about TV has found its perfect moment. A further irony is that Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave is precisely the kind of middle-class grump who would regard a sudden switch in the timing of the news as a perversion of the natural order and phone the BBC to moan. </p> <p>But, for the first six weeks of the new News, Royle and Meldrew should be able to divert the shite-watchers and switchboard-jammers, because these are among television's most brilliant and original comedies. And, in each case, a format now famous has been invigorated by a new plot-point. In One Foot in the Grave it's an impending death: Victor dies in the final episode. In The Royle Family, it's a recent birth. </p> <p>The arrival of Denise and Dave's first child David Keanu perfectly illustrates the mixture of vulgarity and subtlety in Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's writing. Jim Royle's terror of breast-feeding - flinching at a reference to \"leaking in Top Shop\" - might have been predicted, but Denise's post-natal depression and maternal indifference - leaving all nappy-changes and night-waking to her husband - are an unusually dark strain in domestic sitcom. The alarmed glances of the parents - a solidarity of horror at their daughter's state - are beautifully played by Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson. </p> <p>But the show's status as an anthology of popular culture is extended by the kitchen scene in which teenager Anthony Royle and his friend Darren laboriously swap Ali G impersonations. It's typical of the sharpness of observation that one of the boys is a terrible mimic and that both have the latest Beckham shave-cuts. </p> <p>As co-writer, star and now director of this episode, Caroline Aherne is now approaching a Woody Allen or Warren Beatty level of multi-skilling. The only question over the series' classic status is whether its frequent sell-by references - Anne Robinson, Posh and Becks, Ali G - will prevent it from claiming new generations of viewers in the way that Dad's Army and Fawlty Towers have. </p> <p>One Foot in the Grave reminds us that writer David Renwick understands (as with his other hit, Jonathan Creek) that TV is a visual medium. This may seem a truism but TV comedy can be - and frequently is - carried by dialogue. A writer with brilliant ears and lazy eyes can still become rich. Characteristically, however, Renwick's opening episode is built around visual images: a giant television set accidentally bought, two works of modern art, the apparent discovery of human remains in Meldrew's garden. </p> <p>What's notable about both these shows - and what explains their unusual double success in attracting enthusiastic reviews and high ratings - is that they alternate broad and narrow comedy, appealing simultaneously to two audiences. </p> <p>The tabloids enjoy Meldrew for his Alf Garnett-like rants and DIY disasters; the broadsheets acknowledge the nods to Samuel Beckett, which writer David Renwick has admitted are deliberate. There's even an episode in which Victor is buried up to his neck in earth like Winnie in Happy Days - an ironic Beckettian phrase which would be a perfect sub-title for One Foot in the Grave. </p> <p>David Renwick has joked that he kept the literary inspiration for the show's tone quiet because you couldn't tell the Controller of BBC1 you were writing a Beckettian sitcom. But you wonder if he's the only one keeping this secret. The Royle Family also does to the sitcom what the Irish cricketer-dramatist did to the conventions of the boulevard stage comedy, again working through a cunning double structure. </p> <p>Consisting almost entirely of references to very recent popular culture, The Royle Family seems on the surface a wholly mainstream show, but its lack of incident and the risk the dialogue takes with banality and repetition often render it surreal. </p> <p>Indigence prevented Beckett's tramps from having television, but there is something very familiar in the Royle Family's attempt to avert tedium and fear through circular dialogue which frequently turns to discussion of sex and bodily functions.

      "bodyText": "When the first episode of the third series of The Royle Family (tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1) was recorded, its opening dialogue must have seemed merely a little jokey nip at the feeding hand. Watching BBC1, Jim Royle complains that \"it's all shite\" and the family are \"going to have to get Sky\". Now Caroline Aherne's comedy forms, along with the final series of One Foot in the Grave (tonight, 9pm, BBC1), an emergency scheduling bridgehead before the first BBC News (tonight, 10pm, BBC1) to be transmitted in the old ITN News At Ten slot. In short, Jim Royle is charged with preventing the BBC1 audience from deciding it's all shite and buying Sky. The only television comedy in which the dialogue is almost wholly about TV has found its perfect moment. A further irony is that Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave is precisely the kind of middle-class grump who would regard a sudden switch in the timing of the news as a perversion of the natural order and phone the BBC to moan. But, for the first six weeks of the new News, Royle and Meldrew should be able to divert the shite-watchers and switchboard-jammers, because these are among television's most brilliant and original comedies. And, in each case, a format now famous has been invigorated by a new plot-point. In One Foot in the Grave it's an impending death: Victor dies in the final episode. In The Royle Family, it's a recent birth. The arrival of Denise and Dave's first child David Keanu perfectly illustrates the mixture of vulgarity and subtlety in Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's writing. Jim Royle's terror of breast-feeding - flinching at a reference to \"leaking in Top Shop\" - might have been predicted, but Denise's post-natal depression and maternal indifference - leaving all nappy-changes and night-waking to her husband - are an unusually dark strain in domestic sitcom. The alarmed glances of the parents - a solidarity of horror at their daughter's state - are beautifully played by Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson. But the show's status as an anthology of popular culture is extended by the kitchen scene in which teenager Anthony Royle and his friend Darren laboriously swap Ali G impersonations. It's typical of the sharpness of observation that one of the boys is a terrible mimic and that both have the latest Beckham shave-cuts. As co-writer, star and now director of this episode, Caroline Aherne is now approaching a Woody Allen or Warren Beatty level of multi-skilling. The only question over the series' classic status is whether its frequent sell-by references - Anne Robinson, Posh and Becks, Ali G - will prevent it from claiming new generations of viewers in the way that Dad's Army and Fawlty Towers have. One Foot in the Grave reminds us that writer David Renwick understands (as with his other hit, Jonathan Creek) that TV is a visual medium. This may seem a truism but TV comedy can be - and frequently is - carried by dialogue. A writer with brilliant ears and lazy eyes can still become rich. Characteristically, however, Renwick's opening episode is built around visual images: a giant television set accidentally bought, two works of modern art, the apparent discovery of human remains in Meldrew's garden. What's notable about both these shows - and what explains their unusual double success in attracting enthusiastic reviews and high ratings - is that they alternate broad and narrow comedy, appealing simultaneously to two audiences. The tabloids enjoy Meldrew for his Alf Garnett-like rants and DIY disasters; the broadsheets acknowledge the nods to Samuel Beckett, which writer David Renwick has admitted are deliberate. There's even an episode in which Victor is buried up to his neck in earth like Winnie in Happy Days - an ironic Beckettian phrase which would be a perfect sub-title for One Foot in the Grave. David Renwick has joked that he kept the literary inspiration for the show's tone quiet because you couldn't tell the Controller of BBC1 you were writing a Beckettian sitcom. But you wonder if he's the only one keeping this secret. The Royle Family also does to the sitcom what the Irish cricketer-dramatist did to the conventions of the boulevard stage comedy, again working through a cunning double structure. Consisting almost entirely of references to very recent popular culture, The Royle Family seems on the surface a wholly mainstream show, but its lack of incident and the risk the dialogue takes with banality and repetition often render it surreal. Indigence prevented Beckett's tramps from having television, but there is something very familiar in the Royle Family's attempt to avert tedium and fear through circular dialogue which frequently turns to discussion of sex and bodily functions. Beached on their sofa in front of their god of a box, they patiently but hopelessly wait for a revelation which will never come - Waiting For Dando, perhaps. Who would have thought that a primary influence on sitcom at the turn of the 21st century would be Samuel Beckett? But, with many television programmes these days struggling to attract one audience, the BBC is lucky to be beginning its scheduling endgame on BBC1 with a pair of shows which can bring in two. Class act Those who dislike The Royle Family are usually uneasy about its attitude to the working-class; the allegation Mike Leigh has also faced. It's a fair concern - Caroline Aherne's stance seems to me at best cheer-sneer - and reminds us just how much of British TV has social standing as its subject even in an allegedly egalitarian era. The legal drama North Square (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) is advertised as and looks like a British version of LA Law and Ally McBeal, but the drama of the opening episode depends, to a perhaps surprising degree, on the clash of background and accent. The temptation is obvious because the relationship between barristers and their clerks still generally obeys the stereotype of the toff-thug double-act. North Square encourages this by focusing on chief clerk Peter (Phil Davis), a chain-smoking cockney who rebukes a Blairite new barrister for inviting his clerk to first-name him rather than \"sir\" him. In another scene, a toffish lawyer is thumped by a Scottish one for a racist remark. One of the strengths of American legal series has been the way they explained legal foible and detail, but, on the early evidence, North Square seems over-concerned with the Fair Employment Act as a source of dramatic tension. It's true that easy assumptions are undermined - the clerk proves more cultured than the barristers - but even these moments arise from consideration of class. Peter Moffat's writing and Tim Fywell's direction are smarter and glossier respectively than Kavanagh QC, but, for a series billed as breaking the laws of the British legal series, it's worrying that the opening insight - juries coming back into court never make eye-contact with someone they've convicted - has previously been made by both Rumpole and Kavanagh.

      "bodyText": "Hopes of defusing the Middle East crisis suffered a new blow last night when Lebanon's Hizbullah movement claimed to have captured an Israeli intelligence officer - another card to add to three kidnapped soldiers it is already holding. It seemed likely to cast a further shadow over today's Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt, called by President Bill Clinton as a desperate attempt to halt the two-week spiral of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Reports from Lebanon yesterday named the man as Hanan Tennenbaum, described as an agent of the Mossad secret service. But Israeli officials insisted he was a businessman who had gone missing in Switzerland several days ago. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of Hizbullah, made the dramatic announcement at a meeting of Muslim leaders in Beirut. In Jerusalem last night, an Israeli minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, hinted that tough action would be taken against both Hizbullah and Lebanon. But he also signalled that Israel might be prepared to negotiate with the radical Shi'ite Muslim organisation. Israeli Radio said that relatives of the businessman, who holds the army reserve rank of colonel, had reported him missing a few days ago after he had left for a trip abroad. Another report said Mr Tennenbaum had been kidnapped by business partners and transferred to Hizbullah. Swiss officials said they were investigating the allegation. \"We are checking information and searching in Switzerland but we cannot confirm that action took place on Swiss territory,\" said Rolf Debrunner, a spokesman for the justice and police ministry. The missing Israeli is understood to have been working for the Israeli electronics and telecommunications company Tadiran. There is evidence that Switzerland is a fertile ground for a covert war between Israel and Islamic extremists. In June, the Swiss supreme court handed down a one year suspended jail sentence on a Mossad agent caught by Swiss police during a surveillance operation on a suspected Hizbullah activist three years ago. Several Islamic militants live in exile in Switzerland. Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy minister of defence, confirmed that there was a man of that name, but described him as a private individual. Mr Sneh implied that Israel would be calling on the International Red Cross to take up the case, though it has so far failed to provide any information about the whereabouts of the missing soldiers, seized after a border gun battle earlier this month. The brother of one of the three said yesterday that the family had heard nothing at all from any source. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has interceded with the Lebanese authorities. On past precedent there is also likely to be a low-profile effort by Germany, exploiting its close relations with Iran, Hizbullah's most powerful patron. A decade ago, quiet UN diplomacy did much to help secure the release of the last of the western hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. Sheikh Nasrallah said further details would be announced \"at the appropriate time\". But his reference to a \"complicated security operation\" appeared to confirm suspicions of a kidnapping or sting operation. Hizbullah has already said it wants to swap the three soldiers for Arab prisoners held in Israel. Israel is still seeking to clarify the fate of an air force navigator, Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. In the past Lebanese prisoners held by Israel have been exchanged for the remains of Israeli troops killed in action, in complex and secretive deals brokered by the Red Cross. It is an article of faith that Israel will go to extraordinary lengths to bring its boys home. The Lebanese leader said that the latest kidnapping, like the seizure of the soldiers, was to show support for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip. According to the latest figures, 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in the clashes. Hizbullah officials meanwhile called on residents of South Lebanon not to approach the border fence for fear of an Israeli attack. Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, pulled Israeli forces out of Lebanon last May, fufilling an election pledge made on the grounds that a more effective defence could be mounted from inside the border. Israel had occupied parts of South Lebanon since 1978, when it launched a massive operation against the PLO. Prisoners they want to swap Hizbullah wants Israel to release 15 Lebanese prisoners, including two senior leaders. The Palestinians have asked Hizbullah to include about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in any swap Iran wants four of its nationals believed to have been held by Israel since the 1982 Lebanon war to be included in an exchange Israel wants back three of its soldiers, who were captured last week just over the Lebanese border, and presumably also the \"businessman\" whose capture was announced yesterday. It is also seeking information about an air-force navigator, Ron Arad, missing since 1986",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair was meant to be leading the Labour party into the next general election with a historic guarantee that equal numbers of men and women would grace his benches at Westminster.</p> <p>Labour's ambitious commitment of 1990 has, however, been quietly shelved as the party braces itself for a fall in its record tally of 101 women MPs, the first decline in a quarter of a century.</p> <p>In the 32 Labour-held seats up for grabs at the next election, only two women have so far been selected. If the 1997 result were repeated there would be a net loss of four women Labour MPs. To compound the party's embarrassment, the Tories are on course to have more women newly elected to parliament than Labour. No women have been selected in the 22 Tory-held seats which have become vacant. However, women have been selected in marginal seats which the Tories stand a good chance of winning. Six women will be elected on a 3.5% swing to the Tories - a net gain of five - while 12 women will be elected on a swing of 6%.</p> <p>Labour's poor performance with women is matched by its failure to select ethnic minority candidates. The party, which prides itself on its work on race relations in government, will be fielding a mere three Asian candidates in the general election, one of whom stands a good chance of winning.</p> <p>The Tories again seem to have a better record on ethnic minority candidates. The Ugandan-born lawyer, Shailesh Vara, will win Northampton South on a swing of 0.65%. A further 12 Tory Asian candidates are standing in mostly hopeless seats.</p> <p>The figures make grim reading for both parties which admit that they must do a lot better. Labour officials at Millbank are, however, acutely embarrassed because the high hopes of 1997 appear to have been replaced by a realisation that the party appears to be slipping back to its old ways.</p> <p>Labour took an extraordinary leap in 1997 with the election of 101 women MPs, an increase of 64. There were hopes that the party was on course to meet its commitment to have equal numbers of men and women MPs within three general elections of the 1990 party conference.</p> <p>The blocking of all women shortlists a year before the last election dealt a devastating blow to these hopes and set back the campaign for equal representation by years. Labour has attempted to maintain some of the momentum by ruling that all shortlists must have equal numbers of men and women.</p> <p>The dismal selection figures prompted Tony Blair to announce at last month's Labour conference that he will consider legalising all-women shortlists after the next election. His announcement was applauded by aspiring women parliamentarians who complain that the party's structures discriminate against them.</p> <p>Susanna McCorry, a Birmingham city councillor who failed to win the West Bromwich West nomination after making the shortlist, said that the Labour party was still a \"man's world\". She said: \"We need more women role models, otherwise the process can be very isolating for women. Men, who have most votes at parliamentary selection meetings, need to see more competent women as councillors to persuade them to select women.\"</p> <p>Her criticism was echoed by the women's minister, Tessa Jowell, who admitted that the selections have put Labour in a \"disappointing position\". Ms Jowell added: \"The selection process at a constituency level is more likely to select men. But there is also a distaste among many women for the style and culture of politics.\"</p> <p>Ms Jowell said that action to change the culture of politics, coupled with the legalisation of all women shortlists, should reverse the losses at the election after next. \"The all-women shorlists led to great progress that we do not want to lose,\" she said.</p> <p>Few women say they have experienced overt sexism in the Labour party, although the battle for the Dagenham seat was an unpleasant experience for the women involved. However, black and Asian candidates are warning of racism which is hindering their chances of being selected.</p> <p>Senior party figures are said to have warned that it would be unwise to select an Asian or black candidate for the forthcoming West Bromwich West byelection because of the threat from the National Front. Valerie Vaz, an Asian candidate who made it to the shortlist in the constituency but failed to win the nomination, said she was told the party dared not field a candidate from an ethnic minority.</p> <p>Elaine Blake, a graduate in international relations who has been rejected in five seats, said that Labour is terrified of selecting black and Asian candidates in white seats. Ms Blake, 47, a black former councillor, said: \"Labour says that it wants black people but constituencies do not. They want their own colour. My colour is standing in the way and it is very depressing.\"</p> <p>Labour knows that it has a long way to go before its benches reflect the British people. But ministers say they are \"miles ahead\" of their opponents even though the Tories are on course to increase their quota of women MPs. \"It will take 100 years for the Tories to catch up if they carry on at their present rate,\" Ms Jowell said of her opponents who will still only have 20-26 women MPs after the election.</p> <p>Theresa May, the Tories' women's spokesperson, admitted: \"No women have been selected for safe Tory seats and that is glaring,\" she said. Ms May insisted the Tories would continue to reject all-women shortlists, preferring incremental changes to Tory selections. Local associations have been asked to ensure that they interview the same percentage of women who applied for their seat.</p> <p>Both main parties are frank about their shortcomings in selecting candidates. But the Tories believe they are making strides which has prompted Central Office to release regular updates on their candidates' list. By contrast, Millbank is so embarrassed that it will not release its list until all candidates are in place.</p> <p><b>Candidates who draw short straw</b><br></p> <p><b> New Tory women candidates (1997 results in brackets; asterisk indicates likely winner)</b><br></p> <p><b>1)</b> Milton Keynes North East, Marion Rix, (7th target seat - Lab maj 240.

The junior partners in the new coalition will take up two seats in the nine strong assembly cabinet in a reshuffle due to be announced by Labour first secretary Rhodri Morgan today. As part of the new arrangement the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, Mike German, will become deputy first secretary. Discussions on the division of cabinet portfolios were taking place between the party leaders last night. The coalition, modelled on the agreement between the two parties in Scotland, is due to remain in force until the next assembly elections in 2003. It was thrashed out in secret talks earlier this month in a bid to usher in a period of stable government in Cardiff following the turbulence that has marked the past 17 months of minority rule. The agreement, which triggered the resignation of the Labour education and culture secretary, Tom Middlehurst, in protest at the offer of cabinet seats to the Liberal Democrats, is founded on a partnership document that includes many of the policies on which the Lib Dems fought the 1999 assembly elections. Despite the initial disquiet of some Liberal Democrat members at the clandestine nature of the discussions, delegates to the party's autumn conference yesterday voted 130 to 11 in favour of the deal. Labour assembly members and the Labour executive in Wales had already given their approval. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, hailed the vote as a good day for Wales and for devolution. He said the assembly now had the stability it had lacked. \"Today's decision will increase confidence in the assembly and allow it to deliver changes - most of them in the Liberal Democrat manifesto - which will make a real difference to the lives of the people of Wales.\" Among the initiatives to have been agreed is the recruitment of 700 teachers to help reduce class sizes for eight to 11 year olds, the provision of an extra \u00a360m to support farmers and rural communities, and an immediate investigation into student hardship and funding. Agreement has also been reached on a review of voting systems for local government elections in Wales with a committment to pressing Westminster to bring forward assembly sponsored legislation to implement the review's conclusions.",

It recommended a new resettlement service for short-term prisoners, job training and the inclusion of ex-offenders in employers' equal opportunities policies. The periods after which ex-offenders do not legally have to declare their convictions in job applications should be shortened, the report said.

The ecumenical burst from Mr Farrakhan, 67, is said by some to follow a prostate cancer operation last year in which almost died. Dismissed in some quarters as a racist and anti-Semitic demagogue, Mr Farrakhan has begun to build some previously unlikely links, even in the Jewish community. The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Joseph Lieberman, said recently that he had respect for Mr Farrakhan and that he \"would be open\" to talking to him, prompting criticism from more uncompromising Jewish-American groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, for whom Mr Farrakhan remains a pariah. The expected large turnout in Washington may owe less to Mr Farrakhan's sometimes rambling teachings - he has hinted that he may be transported to heaven in a UFO - than to the involvement of leading US hip-hop musicians.

This time the issue is not one of sovereignty or gold, but is about his name. More specifically, whether having a college mascot called \"Monty Montezuma\" is demeaning to native and Mexican Americans. The row is similar to others simmering over the years between native Americans and sports fans over whether the names of teams such as the Washington Redskins and the Atlanta Braves are inherently racist. One side argues that the names are derogatory and belittling, the other argues that they are harmless and part of the American tradition. Earlier this year, after pressure from Indian groups, the state of Maine removed the word squaw where it appeared in placenames. This latest row concerns the San Diego state university mascot, \"Monty Montezuma\", who appears in full Aztec costume to support the college's sports teams - known as the Aztecs since 1925. Pre-Monty, the teams had such names as the Professors and the Wampus Cats. Monty has been appearing at the college's football and basketball games since 1941.

      "body": "<p>Squirrel monkeys have become addicted to marijuana in laboratory tests, according to research published today in a science magazine. The findings will be a blow to campaigners who argue that cannabis is non-addictive and should be legalised.</p> <p>\"These findings suggest that marijuana has as much potential for abuse as drugs such as cocaine,\" Steven Goldberg, from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, reports in Nature Neuroscience.</p> <p>Professor Goldberg and two colleagues at the institute in Maryland, trained the monkeys to press a lever 10 times to inject themselves with intravenous cocaine. When a salt solution was substituted, the monkeys gradually stopped pressing the lever.</p> <p>When the researchers replaced the salt solution with a solution of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical in marijuana which alters mood, the monkeys returned to the lever.</p> <p>The monkeys gave themselves about 30 injections during a one-hour session. Prof Goldberg's team calculated that the amount of drug absorbed by the monkeys in an hour was - weight for weight - about the same as that absorbed by a human adult smoking a marijuana cigarette.</p> <p>Prof Goldberg said that self administration was evidence of addiction, a theory that had been tested repeatedly since the 1950s. \"It has been used with any new drug, to see whether or not it has abuse potential. You check it in animals before you go on to humans. Those procedures were validated by checking virtually all psychoactive drugs. There are virtually no exceptions. Drugs that people abuse, animals intravenously self administer.\"</p> <p>But until now, the exceptions have been hallucinogens used in anti-psychotic treatments - and marijuana. There has been tentative evidence in the past that marijuana is addictive, but campaigners have been able to dismiss it as inconclusive, even though 100,000 in the US each year seek treatment for marijuana dependence, and many see it as a pathway to heroin or other drugs.</p> <p>Smoking marijuana has also been found to increase fivefold the risk of a heart attack in the first hour after inhalation.</p> <p>But a huge proportion of people in Britain claims to have used cannabis without harm. The Conservative party announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy for drugs, and was embarrassed to hear seven front benchers admit to having used the drug. There is also pressure from doctors and researchers who are anxious to explore THC as a medical tool.</p> <p>Marijuana was widely used by doctors until earlier this century. Queen Victoria was reputed to have been prescribed it for period pains. There is a body of evidence that shows it can relieve glaucoma, a form of blindness, and ease the suffering of people with multiple sclerosis.</p> <p>The latest finding creates few problems for the medical lobby, who see synthetic forms of THC as useful prescription drugs, possibly administered in a suppository. But it challenges the argument that marijuana is harmless.</p> <p>However, the Maryland team will be criticised for using just four monkeys in the experiment. In 1981 Prof Goldberg made the same discovery with nicotine and tobacco prompting the US surgeon general's report which began to undermine the tobacco industry and bring about anti-smoking legislation - it was 10 years before other scientists came to the same conclusions using different methods.</p> <p>Prof Goldberg said: \"The fact that animals did not appear to self administer THC has frequently been used to support the idea that it is different from other abused drugs. This is no longer true.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Squirrel monkeys have become addicted to marijuana in laboratory tests, according to research published today in a science magazine. The findings will be a blow to campaigners who argue that cannabis is non-addictive and should be legalised. \"These findings suggest that marijuana has as much potential for abuse as drugs such as cocaine,\" Steven Goldberg, from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, reports in Nature Neuroscience. Professor Goldberg and two colleagues at the institute in Maryland, trained the monkeys to press a lever 10 times to inject themselves with intravenous cocaine. When a salt solution was substituted, the monkeys gradually stopped pressing the lever. When the researchers replaced the salt solution with a solution of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical in marijuana which alters mood, the monkeys returned to the lever. The monkeys gave themselves about 30 injections during a one-hour session. Prof Goldberg's team calculated that the amount of drug absorbed by the monkeys in an hour was - weight for weight - about the same as that absorbed by a human adult smoking a marijuana cigarette. Prof Goldberg said that self administration was evidence of addiction, a theory that had been tested repeatedly since the 1950s. \"It has been used with any new drug, to see whether or not it has abuse potential. You check it in animals before you go on to humans. Those procedures were validated by checking virtually all psychoactive drugs. There are virtually no exceptions. Drugs that people abuse, animals intravenously self administer.\" But until now, the exceptions have been hallucinogens used in anti-psychotic treatments - and marijuana. There has been tentative evidence in the past that marijuana is addictive, but campaigners have been able to dismiss it as inconclusive, even though 100,000 in the US each year seek treatment for marijuana dependence, and many see it as a pathway to heroin or other drugs. Smoking marijuana has also been found to increase fivefold the risk of a heart attack in the first hour after inhalation. But a huge proportion of people in Britain claims to have used cannabis without harm. The Conservative party announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy for drugs, and was embarrassed to hear seven front benchers admit to having used the drug. There is also pressure from doctors and researchers who are anxious to explore THC as a medical tool. Marijuana was widely used by doctors until earlier this century. Queen Victoria was reputed to have been prescribed it for period pains. There is a body of evidence that shows it can relieve glaucoma, a form of blindness, and ease the suffering of people with multiple sclerosis. The latest finding creates few problems for the medical lobby, who see synthetic forms of THC as useful prescription drugs, possibly administered in a suppository. But it challenges the argument that marijuana is harmless. However, the Maryland team will be criticised for using just four monkeys in the experiment. In 1981 Prof Goldberg made the same discovery with nicotine and tobacco prompting the US surgeon general's report which began to undermine the tobacco industry and bring about anti-smoking legislation - it was 10 years before other scientists came to the same conclusions using different methods. Prof Goldberg said: \"The fact that animals did not appear to self administer THC has frequently been used to support the idea that it is different from other abused drugs. This is no longer true.\"",

While worries continue about falling sales, the unions have remained firmly behind the Rover management as Mr Woodley's complaints about destabilising rumour and speculation underline. They have been supportive since the Towers team launched its bid for Rover because of its plans for continued volume production.",

In a speech which marks the start of an ambitious programme of regional tours, the Conservative leader will defend his own party stance on drugs and ethnicity, marriage and sexuality as \"neither libertarian nor authoritarian,\" but a sensible balance between personal freedom and social obligation. To reinforce the Tories' battered street credibility it emerged yesterday that the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, is not ignorant of drug culture: her nephew, Sean Widdecombe, told the News of the World how he spent years in the grip of cannabis use and cocaine addiction. Now 32, the vicar's son supports Auntie Ann's \"zero tolerance\" stance which includes \u00a3100 \"parking tickets\" for possession of cannabis and more severe penalties for drug dealing - \"reclaiming the streets from the drug pushers,\" as Mr Hague will say in Cardiff today. But Mr Hague will be hard-pressed to put much blue water between himself and the prime minister on the drugs issue since both major parties - though not the Liberal Democrats - believe that decriminalisation of soft drugs would send the wrong signal to young people tempted by more dangerous ones. Voters appear to have moved on. According to a Mori poll of 1,014 people last week most people believe (by 58% to 29%) that cannabis should remain illegal, but personal use should be decriminalised. By 55% to 36% a majority even favours legal sale through licensed government outlets - the kind of option that a royal commission would examine if Mr Blair sanctioned such an inquiry. With the debate currently polarised, voters interviewed by Mori for the Mail on Sunday showed some confusion. By 47% to 42% they rejected the simple statement that all cannabis possession should be illegal. They also said it should be \"freely available to adults\" like tobacco and alcohol - by a thumping 66% to 26%. Significantly, voters make a distinction between hard and soft drugs, saying by 64% to 17% that the police should spend less time prosecuting the latter instead of \"clamping down\" on heroin and cocaine use. As for the conduct of politicians, a clear majority (72%) think Mr Hague's eight shadow ministers were right to divulge their own past use of cannabis while 56% think that Mr Blair's team - all but Mo Mowlam and Yvette Cooper - were wrong to refuse to own up. The Mori/MoS poll also found that voters oppose Miss Widdecombe's \u00a3100 fine policy by 49% to 38%, one reason why Mr Hague is prepared to \"discuss\" it with the equally sceptical police. Downing Street last night confirmed that there is no change in government policy: there will be no royal commission and ministers remain determined to decouple hard drug use from associated criminal activity. That reflects Mr Blair's own perspective and experience. As a student in the 70s he was a rock musician who did not do drugs. He told Radio 4's John Humphrys last week that he would prefer his children to drink rather than experiment with drugs. \"I really would prefer my children to have nothing to do with drugs at all.\" Mr Hague, a 14 pint man in his teens, did not do drugs either. Nor, David Blunkett, the education secretary, confirmed yesterday, did he. \"I had enough challenges in life without getting stoned,\" the blind MP told TV viewers. In his speech today Mr Hague will promise to return both to health and educational issues as well as lifestyle choices in the run-up to polling day. He will accuse ministers of being \"too grand\" to address local and regional problems which \"do not grab national headlines.\"",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 The office gossip is alive and well. Or so WPM hears from Sandra in accounts, although if talk about what she gets up to in the photocopying room is true, can she really be trusted? If a recent Office Angels survey is anything to go by, probably not: 93% of office workers have told a colleague something in confidence (the other 7%, presumably those who are all too upfront about their colons and conquests), but 77% of the recipients of these tantalising gems have told at least two other people by the end of the day. It seems that the office gossips simply can't help themselves: one in ten reveal all \"accidentally\", while 36% do so to get attention - imagine the crowds gathered around you at the watercooler, begging for titbits on Alice's lovelife! A frankly evil one in five spread the word \"as a means to demonstrate power\" and have no doubt drilled spyholes between the toilet cubicles in order to further their plans for office domination. </p> <p>Not that the poor subject of this tortuous chain of slander is altogether innocent. Two-thirds of them find out that their confidence has been betrayed by listening in to the office grapevine themselves; 11% claim - entirely by chance, WPM is sure - to have discovered that they are the hot topic of office conversation by reading an email. Bring back Big Brother, says WPM: at least then we could bitch freely without all this need for secrecy and respect for hurt feelings... </p> <p>\u0095 WPM sits right next to a sorry-looking pot plant of some botanical description and it's certainly done her no harm. She wouldn't claim, however, that it has improved her reaction time on the computer by 12% (admittedly because she wouldn't want to risk the raised eyebrows of her colleagues in response to boasts of productivity). Researchers in something called \"environmental psychology\", however, have made this very claim; moreover, they add that introducing a plant to your workstation could lower your blood pressure and keep you on an even keel. Plants also, say the experts at the Agricultural University of Norway, reduce your chances of suffering from coughs, fatigue and, er, an itchy face. Problem is, British expenditure on green things currently stands at a penny-pinching \u00a35 a head. And our meanness extends to forgetting to water them, thus hastening their early death. Research hasn't pinpointed the effects of decaying spider plants lolling over the computer screen, but WPM bets that it can't be good for productivity levels. </p> <p>*\u0095 WPM has, for one week only, tired of furthering herself, personally and professionally, by means of career-enhancing, life-enriching websites. So this week's site is a frivolous diversion tactic which has successfully distracted WPM from more pressing duties. The site is <a href=\"http://www.uproar.co.uk\">www.uproar.co.uk</a>, full of games for those dull periods that occur around mid-afternoon.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 The office gossip is alive and well. Or so WPM hears from Sandra in accounts, although if talk about what she gets up to in the photocopying room is true, can she really be trusted? If a recent Office Angels survey is anything to go by, probably not: 93% of office workers have told a colleague something in confidence (the other 7%, presumably those who are all too upfront about their colons and conquests), but 77% of the recipients of these tantalising gems have told at least two other people by the end of the day. It seems that the office gossips simply can't help themselves: one in ten reveal all \"accidentally\", while 36% do so to get attention - imagine the crowds gathered around you at the watercooler, begging for titbits on Alice's lovelife! A frankly evil one in five spread the word \"as a means to demonstrate power\" and have no doubt drilled spyholes between the toilet cubicles in order to further their plans for office domination. Not that the poor subject of this tortuous chain of slander is altogether innocent. Two-thirds of them find out that their confidence has been betrayed by listening in to the office grapevine themselves; 11% claim - entirely by chance, WPM is sure - to have discovered that they are the hot topic of office conversation by reading an email. Bring back Big Brother, says WPM: at least then we could bitch freely without all this need for secrecy and respect for hurt feelings... \u0095 WPM sits right next to a sorry-looking pot plant of some botanical description and it's certainly done her no harm. She wouldn't claim, however, that it has improved her reaction time on the computer by 12% (admittedly because she wouldn't want to risk the raised eyebrows of her colleagues in response to boasts of productivity). Researchers in something called \"environmental psychology\", however, have made this very claim; moreover, they add that introducing a plant to your workstation could lower your blood pressure and keep you on an even keel. Plants also, say the experts at the Agricultural University of Norway, reduce your chances of suffering from coughs, fatigue and, er, an itchy face. Problem is, British expenditure on green things currently stands at a penny-pinching \u00a35 a head. And our meanness extends to forgetting to water them, thus hastening their early death. Research hasn't pinpointed the effects of decaying spider plants lolling over the computer screen, but WPM bets that it can't be good for productivity levels. *\u0095 WPM has, for one week only, tired of furthering herself, personally and professionally, by means of career-enhancing, life-enriching websites. So this week's site is a frivolous diversion tactic which has successfully distracted WPM from more pressing duties. The site is www.uproar.co.uk, full of games for those dull periods that occur around mid-afternoon. There's Catchphrase, which WPM was useless at; a trivia quiz, which proved more of a morale booster; and those bizarre Family Fortunes questionnaires (\"name something you loved to sit on when you were a small child\"). Once registered, you can chat with other bored office workers, with names such as Sun Goddess and Elvira 666. And that's it. No industry news, no job ads, no pretence of usefulness. But oddly compelling. \u0095 Today is Bosses' Day, as you all know, of course.

      "bodyText": "A meeting that could seal the fate of the Athens Olympics takes place today between the woman in charge of the project, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, and the prime minister, Costas Simitis. It follows a week of feverish speculation in the Greek capital that Ms Angelopoulos - who led Greece's winning bid to host the 2004 Olympics, and then had to be brought back in six months ago to rescue the preparations after withering criticism from the head of the international Olympic committee (IOC) - is about to resign because of disputes with government ministers. Ms Angelopoulos wants the back-stabbing to stop and the red tape untied. There is already some sense of panic about whether the city will be ready, and should Ms Angelopoulos quit, plans for 2004 will be in worse turmoil; some even say the games could go with her. \"If Gianna goes, then the red phase will have been reached,\" an IOC official, who asked not to be named, said this week. He was referring to an extraordinary public warning in April from the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. He told the Greeks that there were three categories of organisation of the Olympics: green, where everything is proceeding smoothly; yellow, where there are \"many problems\"; and red, where the \"games are in danger\". Greece, he said, was \"at the end of the yellow phase\". Many of the promises made when Athens won the games in 1997 have not been kept, and the local organisers have become mired in Greece's notorious bureaucracy. \"The games are coming home,\" Ms Angelopoulos, 45, had said in Sydney. But to what? Greek government officials insist that everything is on schedule; with a new underground expected to ease traffic, and a new airport scheduled to open in March 2001, the capital is being transformed, they say. But there are many worrying gaps. The sites for the athletes' and media villages have still not been chosen. The new airport built by a German company is ready, but there are no road or rail connections. When Greece won the bid, it said that 70% of the sports venues were in place, but three years later that figure remains unchanged. The IOC wants the sites ready by November 2003 so they can be properly tested; the Greeks say they will not be ready until May 2004. After Mr Samaranch's broadside, Mr Simitis, who had initially snubbed Ms Angelopoulos - the rumour was that she wanted too much power - asled her to mend the damage, despite misgivings from some in his ruling Socialist party. Ms Angelopoulos, who is married to a shipping tycoon, Theodore Angelopoulos, is a former conservative MP who the Socialists suspect of having political ambitions still. One minister said last week: \"This [the Olympics] is the biggest thing to happen to Greece this decade. Do you think we're going to let her take the credit?\" Since taking on the role as president of the Athens 2004 organising committee (Athoc) six months ago, Ms Angelopoulos is generally credited with injecting a sense of urgency into preparations for the games, and with improving relations with a jittery IOC. But in Greece's febrile politics, she has also had to brave a lot of criticism from politicians and the media; this, she says, has undermined the project. \"I don't think that we will fail,\" Ms Angelopoulos said, \"but they must leave us alone to do our work. When you are trying to cover your back, you can't devote yourself to your task.\" The knives were out for her even before the Olympic flag had arrived in Greece from the Sydney games on October 3. She came under fire from politicians and the media for \"excessive\" spending on hospitality in Sydney. There was wrangling about her officials' salaries as well as her demands that she be given more authority to cut through the bureaucratic delays that have cast doubt on Athens's ability to stage the games. She was also criticised for not returning from Sydney on the same plane as Greece's athletes and officials - she flew in her private jet. Speculation about her future increased after a \"clear-the-air\" meeting with Mr Simitis on October 5, after which she announced she was taking a week off \"for personal reasons\", and reports of a split in the five-member Athoc executive committee. \"What's up with Gianna?\" asked one newspaper headline, while another bayed \"2004 pieces!\" The bickering reached such a pitch last week that Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive monitoring the project, stepped in to call for a ceasefire. Mr Rogge will head an IOC delegation to Greece in November to assess progress. At today's meeting Ms Angelopoulos wants an assurance from the prime minister that she retains his support. She also wants a commitment that he will act to control his ministers. Staff at the Athens 2004 office were playing down the significance of their boss's \"break\" last night, saying she was in London visiting her children. Even if she did quit, they added, the games would not be doomed. \"Look how many times they changed the management in Sydney,\" said one. \"And they didn't take the games from them.\" Given the potential for new embarrassment to the country, however, some Greeks are thinking the unthinkable - that it might be better if the games went elsewhere.

Speculation that the suppressed opposition movement would take inspiration from events in Belgrade appeared unfounded. In the run-up to the election, the president instructed his security forces to ensure that a \"Yugoslav variant\" did not occur. But even before the count, human rights groups said the poll was neither free nor fair. Of the 565 candidates running for 110 seats in the lower chamber, only 54 were not firm Lukashenko supporters. Some opposition candidates were barred from running on registration technicalities; while others chose to boycott the poll altogether, arguing that the election - like the regime - was not legitimate because it was based on Mr Lukashenko's unconstitutional dissolution of an earlier, opposition-led chamber in 1996, when the president also extended his powers radically through a referendum of dubious legitimacy. The few anti-Lukashenko candidates who did run were denied the chance to campaign, their message stifled by the regime's continuing crackdown on the press. Mr Lukashenko, a former chicken farmer, dismissed the opposition as a \"handful of windbags\" funded by the west. His firm suppression of the opposition movement has kept it small and those who are active risk severe retribution. Over the past two years, a string of key opposition figures have died, been imprisoned or vanished without trace. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which acts as an election watchdog, did not send its observers to the vote yesterday, after the Belarus government failed to follow its guidelines by providing the opposition equal access to television and radio, and allowing it to participate in electoral commissions. The former prime minister, Mikhail Chigir, an opposition leader who decided to break the boycott to launch a bid for power in next year's presidential elections, said Mr Lukashenko could not have won if the opposition had enjoyed access to television.

      "body": "<p>Some people thrive in the face of adversity. Captain Riette Everton is one of those people. In <strong> Witness: Satanic Crimes</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday), she was dressed up like a deckchair at Cowes and chuckling like a beaver. As one half of South Africa's occult-related Crimes Squad, Riette and her boss, Colonel Kobus Jonker - who is equally stoic and wears a Donald Duck tie - investigate crimes like that committed by a woman with supernatural leanings in a suburb of Cape Town. She lured a heavily pregnant 16-year-old girl back to her house, handcuffed her to a chair and cut the baby from her stomach, depositing it in a duffel bag before making her escape. </p> <p>Luckily, the local constabulary caught the Satanist before she could do anything devilish to the infant but this case is symptomatic of the growth in \"Satanic crimes\" which has meant Riette and Kobus's workload has increased exponentially over the last five years. In the \"new\" South Africa, graveyards are kept under 24 hour surveillance to deter grave-robbers, the ritual sacrifice of cats is commonplace and heads are often stolen from corpses - or cut from living folks less than willing to give them up - to be used in Satanic initiation ceremonies. (Why they can't use a digestive biscuit like normal people, I don't know). </p> <p>Despite the terrible nature of the crimes they confront, Riette and Kobus are chipper because they have God on their side. He protects them \"more than a gun or a knife or a bulletproof vest\" (not too sure about this myself), and it is Riette's Christian duty to carry on hunting down people who smear cats' brains over their neighbours' front doors and like Iron Maiden.

      "bodyText": "Some people thrive in the face of adversity. Captain Riette Everton is one of those people. In Witness: Satanic Crimes (Channel 4, Sunday), she was dressed up like a deckchair at Cowes and chuckling like a beaver. As one half of South Africa's occult-related Crimes Squad, Riette and her boss, Colonel Kobus Jonker - who is equally stoic and wears a Donald Duck tie - investigate crimes like that committed by a woman with supernatural leanings in a suburb of Cape Town. She lured a heavily pregnant 16-year-old girl back to her house, handcuffed her to a chair and cut the baby from her stomach, depositing it in a duffel bag before making her escape. Luckily, the local constabulary caught the Satanist before she could do anything devilish to the infant but this case is symptomatic of the growth in \"Satanic crimes\" which has meant Riette and Kobus's workload has increased exponentially over the last five years. In the \"new\" South Africa, graveyards are kept under 24 hour surveillance to deter grave-robbers, the ritual sacrifice of cats is commonplace and heads are often stolen from corpses - or cut from living folks less than willing to give them up - to be used in Satanic initiation ceremonies. (Why they can't use a digestive biscuit like normal people, I don't know). Despite the terrible nature of the crimes they confront, Riette and Kobus are chipper because they have God on their side. He protects them \"more than a gun or a knife or a bulletproof vest\" (not too sure about this myself), and it is Riette's Christian duty to carry on hunting down people who smear cats' brains over their neighbours' front doors and like Iron Maiden. And quite right too. Kobus even visits a man convicted of a Satanic crime - the decapitation of a homeless man - in prison and holds his hand. I mean, the man says he has become a Christian but you can never be too sure. Don't touch the glass, don't pass him anything.

One, the Grammy-winning Norwegian vocalist, composer and teacher Sidsel Endreson, is from such a distant musical location that the jazz circuit is hardly the place for her, if it weren't so hard to imagine anywhere more appropriate. </p> <p>The three represent a fascinating contrast with the pop mainstream, yet they all live at a time of erupting resourcefulness in terms of what the human voice might be stretched to do. Singers replicating 1940s Latin swing, firing off the defiant percussive monologues of ghetto rap, synth-bending their voices like electronic instruments, or echoing the soul and funk traditions of Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder can comfortably rub shoulders in the pop charts. The musical voice has rarely sounded so varied and fruitful. Against that backdrop, these three improvisers might seem to be existing in a backwater, but in their different ways they influence the mainstream by the independence of their skills. </p> <p>Norma Winstone is a long-respected improviser, composer and lyric-writer with a sound as glancingly muted and supple as a flute. She sings in a complex and ambitious chamber-improv band featuring American pianist Fred Hersch. The other two are in parallel worlds with very little in common but musicality, timing and consummate control of a completely personal sound. At the conservative end, the expatriate American Stacey Kent played the Soho Pizza Express. She put her graceful spin on a programme of Broadway love songs and show tunes so convincingly that a young audience discovered it for the first time, while an older one was filled with nostalgia and respect for a still startling craft. </p> <p>Meanwhile at Ronnie Scott's, the Norwegian Sidsel Endreson baffled some, spooked some and mesmerised others with an utterly personal angle on contemporary vocals that sound like Jan Garbarek's horn lines being sung. Unlike Kent, with her sharp clothes, deft urbanity and knowing wit, Endreson is distant, entranced, ungroomed, private. Yet she let herself free-fall into the distracted atmosphere of a metropolitan nightclub rather than a bare-bulb improv room or a recital hall. She opened with an astonishing 10 minutes of a cappella lament, echoing Nordic folk melodies vanishing into or spiralling into shivery yodels, that left the audience in stunned silence. Endreson's remarkable range of timbre and her conviction that hot licks aren't indispensable to communication left everyone in the room influenced by her imposing presence. \"I was thinking earlier on today, 'What the fuck am I doing here?' \" Endreson asked the audience at the end. Opening ears to what the human voice can do, that's what. </p> <p>When Winstone met the cabaret-jazz superstar Diana Krall on a European tour, she was surprised to find that Krall and her band knew some of Winstone's most exploratory records. \"Funnily enough, she was almost apologetic about her own work by comparison,\" Winstone recalls, \"which she certainly doesn't need to be. I guess I keep wanting to make something different happen, and in material terms that's my downfall. I'll do pieces with John Parricelli and Iain Ballamy that mix free things with Brazilian things; sometimes I'll do songs, sometimes impressionistic things. Maybe if audiences never know what they're going to hear, then it's never going to be that big. But I'm always thinking there's something else to do, something else to discover. That's what keeps me interested.\"</p>",

Soon, they may no longer have to suffer the disappointments of limited ticket availability, or battle against rush hour traffic to make the theatre on time. Soon they may just be able to kick off their shoes, snuggle up in front of their home computer, press the start button and go. </p> <p>Soon, but not yet. Last week Random Dance Company used the net to broadcast live footage of their latest show, Trilogy, which they were performing at the Greenwich Dance Agency. This enterprising project sounded as if it might herald a whole new era of computer performance - of dance freely and universally available on the net. When I logged on to the webcast on Thursday night, it was how I imagine the early days of television to have been: a technological thrill that could only sustain a blurry reality. </p> <p>Getting access to the show was in fact as fraught as any last minute dash to the theatre. After clicking on to Random's website, I then had to painstakingly download some jangly American software which I finally had to ask my 10-year-old son how to operate. Then, when the dancers at last came on screen, they performed with nothing like the articulate grace and speed of live performers. Instead they were shadowy, stilted images, which frequently disintegrated into cubist squares or else stalled, sullenly, into freeze frame poses. </p> <p>Not that the webcast didn't have its own beauty. The harder the software struggled, the more magically the dancers morphed into radiant Rothkoesque blocks of colour or abstracted into fascinating outlines of movement. I stuck with the whole performance out of a genuine curiosity - but even so it was light years away from being the real thing. </p> <p>Yet if computer technology can't yet deliver reliable quality dance on the net, it has already produced some enthralling effects on stage. Wayne MacGregor, director and choreographer of Random, has long been exploring the poetic potential of electronic imagery in dance. In collaboration with state-of-the-art designers he has used computer generated images to transform the stage. Virtual architecture projected onto scrims and screens have made the dancers look as if they inhabited mysterious, vaulting spaces, while animated bodies have been projected among the real performers, as if they were dancers visiting from another planet or another age. </p> <p>MacGregor's willingness to embrace new technology is shared by the great American choreographer Merce Cunningham, whose company was also performing in London last week. Like MacGregor, Cunningham remains loyally entranced by the flesh-and-blood beauty of real dancers, yet he uses computerised imagery to expand his work into other dimensions. The live performers are as charismatically present as they would be in any traditional work, yet the mix of animated electronic figures and perspective-bending digital scenery seems to project them, simultaneously into a strange and potent future. </p> <p>Technology has also spawned a new genre of interactive dance events, exemplified by Thecla Schiphorst's mesmerising video installation Bodymaps. In order to watch this, you enter a darkened room, a kind of theatre, where the only object present is a table covered in white velvet cloth. As you reach to touch it, sounds of rippling water issue from unseen speakers and the image of a woman lying on a bed materialises on the cloth. You look down at her as she curls into a foetal ball, as if protesting at your presence, then you touch another section of the table and she rolls away into invisibility. A few seconds later she reconfigures as Ophelia floating down a river, then morphs into a figure blanketed by flames. </p> <p>This is one version of the work but there is an infinity of ways in which it may present itself. In order to create Bodymaps Schiphorst filmed herself (and briefly her son) in a variety of horizontal \"dances\" - floating through water, moving around a bed, lying on the floor - overlaying some of this footage with other imagery such as fire and reflected light. She then broke the footage down into short video sequences which could play in a totally random order and accompanied them with equally random sequences of sound. </p> <p>Visitors to the installation activate these sequences by touching hidden sensors on the table, and even though the effect isn't directly causal (our touch only speeds up certain transi tions), it often feels as if Schiphorst's body is responding to our presence. All of her movements are physically and emotionally very reactive - curling, twitching and stretching - and the fact that she's \"lying down\" makes her seem vulnerable to a degree that's both erotic and tender. As we brush our hand over the table surface, tap or tickle Schiphorst's image, we not only watch her \"sensations\" and her \"emotions\" but seem to feel them ourselves. </p> <p>The technology can sound intimidating and incomprehensible. Yet the effects it produces can be surprisingly intimate and direct. Even though computers may never produce a true substitute for dance, the science is changing and intensifying the artform all the time. Virtual dancers and virtual images may only be blips of electricity but they can generate experiences as sensuous and powerful as real flesh and blood. </p> <p>Thecla Schiphorst's Bodymaps ends tonight at the ICA, London SW1 (020- 7930 3647).

Its one remaining anal gland had gone haywire, requiring a costly operation, but she was no longer insured. I don't blame her. Yesterday I opened a letter from my dog's insurers, Pet Plunder, to find their costs had trebled. What's more, the dog may only have any illness once. Repeat illnesses will not be covered.</p> <p>What sort of a bargain is that? Naturally I rang to complain. Why had the price rocketed? \"Because you live in London, Madam.\"</p> <p>The dog isn't the only problem. My friend Maureen's mother came to live with her recently and needed her possessions valued. Her old ring, bought 60 years ago for a snip, is now worth the Royal Mint. Maureen's insurance will now cost zillions and she must have an alarm fitted so that passing robbers will assume her house is stuffed with valuables, batter their way in, chop her mother's finger off and run away with the ring. Bound to, because she lives in London.</p> <p>These insurers are on to a good thing with London. They know we think that everything is more dangerous here. They can cash in on The Terror. We know, because they've told us so, that London is where the bulk of robbers, muggers and psychopaths live, more houses subside and burn down, most property is trashed and stolen, dogs are more likely to bite, die and be horribly poorly. Here in town, cars are bound to crash and every electrical appliance goes wrong. Living here, it is absolutely vital that I insure the house, the car, the dog, the fridge, the cooker, the computer, my life, my health, my death and the microwave.</p> <p>In our house, years ago, a painting fell off the wall, knocked over a lighted candle on the mantelpiece below it, the candle fell down, rolled across the floor and under the bed, stayed alight, set light to the mattress and burned away my bedroom.

      "bodyText": "This morning Sylvia and I met a distressed woman walking her spaniel on the Heath. Its one remaining anal gland had gone haywire, requiring a costly operation, but she was no longer insured. I don't blame her. Yesterday I opened a letter from my dog's insurers, Pet Plunder, to find their costs had trebled. What's more, the dog may only have any illness once. Repeat illnesses will not be covered. What sort of a bargain is that? Naturally I rang to complain. Why had the price rocketed? \"Because you live in London, Madam.\" The dog isn't the only problem. My friend Maureen's mother came to live with her recently and needed her possessions valued. Her old ring, bought 60 years ago for a snip, is now worth the Royal Mint. Maureen's insurance will now cost zillions and she must have an alarm fitted so that passing robbers will assume her house is stuffed with valuables, batter their way in, chop her mother's finger off and run away with the ring. Bound to, because she lives in London. These insurers are on to a good thing with London. They know we think that everything is more dangerous here. They can cash in on The Terror. We know, because they've told us so, that London is where the bulk of robbers, muggers and psychopaths live, more houses subside and burn down, most property is trashed and stolen, dogs are more likely to bite, die and be horribly poorly. Here in town, cars are bound to crash and every electrical appliance goes wrong. Living here, it is absolutely vital that I insure the house, the car, the dog, the fridge, the cooker, the computer, my life, my health, my death and the microwave. In our house, years ago, a painting fell off the wall, knocked over a lighted candle on the mantelpiece below it, the candle fell down, rolled across the floor and under the bed, stayed alight, set light to the mattress and burned away my bedroom. It could only have happened in London. Or could it? I asked a dog insurer why London, or any large city, is so expensive. \"Most claims come from London,\" says he. \"But aren't most dogs in London?\" \"Yes, that's partly it.\" I smell a rat. Or could it be a sick dog? It better not be.",

      "bodyText": "Chevron is expected to announce the takeover of its rival, Texaco, as early as today after the boards of the two US oil groups met yesterday afternoon. The deal is likely to be structured as an all-share transaction valuing the combined group at about $90bn (\u00a362bn). By combining two of the largest US companies, the merger further consolidates a global industry already dominated by a handful of huge corporations. Analysts yesterday expressed surprise at the timing of the merger, given the proximity of next month's presidential elections and the turmoil in the oil market. Consumer groups in the US have raised objections to further consolidation in the industry because of fears that it would increase prices. The last wave of consolidation, which saw the marriage of Exxon with Mobil and BP with Amoco, started two years ago at a time when oil prices were a third of their present level. Chevron and Texaco are expected to announce cost savings of as much as $1bn as a result of their merger. Based on Friday's closing share price, Texaco was valued at $30.4bn, compared with $55bn for San Fransisco-based Chevron. A combined Chevron/Texaco is likely to have to divest itself of certain assets in order to win anti-trust approval in the US. Chevron would also have to unravel a joint venture with Shell.",

If it goes ahead, and that was still in doubt last night, the meeting is unlikely to produce anything more than a sticking plaster for the gaping wounds of the past fortnight. Yasser Arafat is clearly in two minds, as has been the case throughout this crisis. He spent part of yesterday with representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, militants who reject the Oslo peace process outright.</p> <p>Mr Arafat's release from jail of 65 members of these two groups has enraged Israel. But his decision reflects the extent to which the recent, all-consuming violence has pushed him into the arms of the radicals. In Gaza, thousands of supporters of Mr Arafat's own Fatah organisation urged their leader to boycott the summit altogether. The two recent terrorist incidents in Yemen, another Hizbullah kidnapping, attacks on synagogues in France and Britain, and (in a less directly connected way) the weekend hijacking of a Saudi airliner to Baghdad, have all underlined the way in which extremists in the Arab world are emboldened by the current confrontation.</p> <p>Assuming he does show up in Egypt, the Palestinian leader is expected to demand an international inquiry into the events of the past 17 days. While the violence appeared to have subsided yesterday, Raed Hammouda Yaacoub died in a Ramallah hospital of a bullet wound received last week.</p> <p>He became the 100th person to die, all but seven of whom were Palestinians or Israeli Arab citizens, and about one in five of whom were reportedly children or teenagers. This carnage does indeed demand a full, impartial and urgent investigation, and Israel should not continue to obstruct it. Mr Arafat also wants an Israeli military pullback from the outskirts of Palestinian cities, an end to the economic siege of West Bank and Gaza workers and, of course, agreement by the Israeli army to cease fire.</p> <p>For his part, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, is insisting that Palestinian violence end, that the freed militants be rearrested, that Palestinian-controlled media cease what Israel sees as incitement, and that guarantees be given protecting Jewish holy places. If he does not get what he wants, he will act on his threat to bring one of Israel's leading rejectionists, Ariel Sharon, into a government of national unity and take the \"war\" to the Palestinians. Thus is Mr Barak, like Mr Arafat, driven to extremes.</p> <p>The question of whether the peace process can be revived in its present form is one that may only sensibly be addressed once the violence is halted. All the same, Bill Clinton's administration should already be asking itself some hard questions. It was Mr Clinton who pulled out all the stops for an ambitious, comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian agreement, applying extraordinary, personal pressure at the Camp David summit last July. Although all sides admitted it was a high-stakes gamble, Mr Clinton's Dayton-style tactics raised expectations to fever pitch.</p> <p>The past fortnight has, in one sense, been the bitter result of that great disappointment, the extreme reaction to America's all-or-nothing, headbanging diplomacy. The US, if it ever was, is no longer viewed by much of the Arab world as an even-handed peace-broker. And Mr Clinton, in any event, has but three months left to fret about his \"legacy\". Since the Oslo process began, it has been a given that peace will only come through US-led mediation. Maybe that perception is one, among many others, that is now changing. But first things first. Today's priority is to stop the killing.</p>",

In Gaza, thousands of supporters of Mr Arafat's own Fatah organisation urged their leader to boycott the summit altogether. The two recent terrorist incidents in Yemen, another Hizbullah kidnapping, attacks on synagogues in France and Britain, and (in a less directly connected way) the weekend hijacking of a Saudi airliner to Baghdad, have all underlined the way in which extremists in the Arab world are emboldened by the current confrontation. Assuming he does show up in Egypt, the Palestinian leader is expected to demand an international inquiry into the events of the past 17 days. While the violence appeared to have subsided yesterday, Raed Hammouda Yaacoub died in a Ramallah hospital of a bullet wound received last week. He became the 100th person to die, all but seven of whom were Palestinians or Israeli Arab citizens, and about one in five of whom were reportedly children or teenagers. This carnage does indeed demand a full, impartial and urgent investigation, and Israel should not continue to obstruct it. Mr Arafat also wants an Israeli military pullback from the outskirts of Palestinian cities, an end to the economic siege of West Bank and Gaza workers and, of course, agreement by the Israeli army to cease fire. For his part, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, is insisting that Palestinian violence end, that the freed militants be rearrested, that Palestinian-controlled media cease what Israel sees as incitement, and that guarantees be given protecting Jewish holy places. If he does not get what he wants, he will act on his threat to bring one of Israel's leading rejectionists, Ariel Sharon, into a government of national unity and take the \"war\" to the Palestinians. Thus is Mr Barak, like Mr Arafat, driven to extremes. The question of whether the peace process can be revived in its present form is one that may only sensibly be addressed once the violence is halted. All the same, Bill Clinton's administration should already be asking itself some hard questions. It was Mr Clinton who pulled out all the stops for an ambitious, comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian agreement, applying extraordinary, personal pressure at the Camp David summit last July. Although all sides admitted it was a high-stakes gamble, Mr Clinton's Dayton-style tactics raised expectations to fever pitch. The past fortnight has, in one sense, been the bitter result of that great disappointment, the extreme reaction to America's all-or-nothing, headbanging diplomacy. The US, if it ever was, is no longer viewed by much of the Arab world as an even-handed peace-broker. And Mr Clinton, in any event, has but three months left to fret about his \"legacy\". Since the Oslo process began, it has been a given that peace will only come through US-led mediation. Maybe that perception is one, among many others, that is now changing. But first things first. Today's priority is to stop the killing.",

      "body": "<p>Jonathan Freedland (Why Israel's peaceniks feel betrayed, October 14) explains in eloquent terms why the Israeli left feels let down by its Palestinian peace partners. While I think he is right, I think he fails to account for the reason for this, which lies in the different goals each side had in the peace process.</p> <p>While for Israel the process was a means to consolidate and legitimise its ill-gotten gains of war, for the Palestinians it was meant to be a means of restitution for injustice. These two goals are incompatible.</p> <p>If the international community is to play a constructive role, it must affirm the principle that the illegitimate gains of war cannot stand. In the case of Israel this means the territories that it has illegally occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and the ethnic cleansing within its own borders since 1948. The return of territory acquired by force and the right of refugees to return home are the very principles that the US and Britain have been loudly asserting in the context of the Balkans. Why should they not apply in the Middle East?<br><b>A Dawar<br>Robinson College, Cambridge</b></p> <p>Katharine Viner writes: \"If Palestine became a state, if Israel withdraws from all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem ... then the Palestinian community seems likely to accept the loss of pre-1967 Israel\" (Fear and rage in Palestine, October 14). So the Palestinians reserve the right never to have to spell out exactly what they want and to resort to violence when they don't get it. Is that because, in their heart of hearts, what they still really want is the destruction of Israel?<br><b>David Kalisch<br>Budleigh Salterton, Devon</b></p> <p>With your fly-on-the-wall reporting of the alleged mobile phone conversation on the mob killing of two Israeli soldiers ('I have just killed your husband' wife was told, October 14), the Guardian follows the tabloids in ghoulishly embellishing reports of an already grim event. Only the bereaved wife or the mob speaker could have had first hand knowledge of that conversation, and neither would be reliable enough to quote without attribution.<br><b>Peter Reina<br>London</b></p> <p>Whenever there is conflict in Israel-Palestine the west puts on a grave face and urges restraint on both sides. The assumption is that there are two equally valid moral positions in this dispute, and that we must not take sides.</p> <p>Yet what lies behind the Israel-Palestine conflict is the systematic colonisation and ethnic cleansing of a piece of land, all of which used to be called Palestine.</p> <p>Theodor Herzl rightly foresaw more than 100 years ago that this would be a necessary precondition for the creation of a Jewish state. The rapid expansion of settlements and exclusive connecting roads in the West Bank and Gaza during Ehud Barak's \"liberal\" period of office is clear evidence, if any were needed, that such a policy is not just an unfortunate historical relic.</p> <p>Would it be going too far to suggest that successive Israeli governments bear more responsibility than the Palestinians for the present unrest?<br><b>Dr Francis Clark-Lowes<br>Palestine Solidarity Campaign</b></p> <p>A week before Ariel Sharon's cheap political stunt, I attended a conference of the International Society for Justice Research on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The last speaker was a Palestinian journalist, who gave an account of the harassment of Palestinians at the hands of Israelis, of the mockery made of legal due process when Palestinian lawyers are kept waiting outside the courtroom while their Israeli counterparts confer with the judge, of the abrogation of civil, legal and human rights.</p> <p>But most of all, she brought tales of routine humiliation and contempt of Palestinians. With the help of video footage, she told how the Israeli Defence Force sets up armed posts on the roofs of Palestinian houses. There is no attempt to minimise the noise or the disruption. People just have to live with it. In the case on the video, the soldiers were happy to use the roof of a house as their latrine. Their voices could be heard clearly laughing and joking together as one told the other that the latter had just pissed on the head of whoever was below.</p> <p>When injustice and deprivation are perceived as based upon group identity, the response is collective action. If such treatment is routine, then the expressions of frustration and fury in response to a cheap political gesture are not surprising.<br><b>Rosamund Stock<br>London School of Economics</b></p> <p>Once again (Letters, October 14), we see the old canard that wars are caused by religion. In the 20th century we have seen millions butchered by atheistic regimes, such as those of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, giving the lie to the notion that all we need to do to have peace is to eradicate religion. Humanity will always find an excuse for war - religion has simply been a convenient one throughout history.<br><b>Paul Thompson<br>Friends in Christ (Primitive Quakers)</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland (Why Israel's peaceniks feel betrayed, October 14) explains in eloquent terms why the Israeli left feels let down by its Palestinian peace partners. While I think he is right, I think he fails to account for the reason for this, which lies in the different goals each side had in the peace process. While for Israel the process was a means to consolidate and legitimise its ill-gotten gains of war, for the Palestinians it was meant to be a means of restitution for injustice. These two goals are incompatible. If the international community is to play a constructive role, it must affirm the principle that the illegitimate gains of war cannot stand. In the case of Israel this means the territories that it has illegally occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and the ethnic cleansing within its own borders since 1948. The return of territory acquired by force and the right of refugees to return home are the very principles that the US and Britain have been loudly asserting in the context of the Balkans. Why should they not apply in the Middle East? A Dawar Robinson College, Cambridge Katharine Viner writes: \"If Palestine became a state, if Israel withdraws from all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem ... then the Palestinian community seems likely to accept the loss of pre-1967 Israel\" (Fear and rage in Palestine, October 14). So the Palestinians reserve the right never to have to spell out exactly what they want and to resort to violence when they don't get it. Is that because, in their heart of hearts, what they still really want is the destruction of Israel? David Kalisch Budleigh Salterton, Devon With your fly-on-the-wall reporting of the alleged mobile phone conversation on the mob killing of two Israeli soldiers ('I have just killed your husband' wife was told, October 14), the Guardian follows the tabloids in ghoulishly embellishing reports of an already grim event. Only the bereaved wife or the mob speaker could have had first hand knowledge of that conversation, and neither would be reliable enough to quote without attribution. Peter Reina London Whenever there is conflict in Israel-Palestine the west puts on a grave face and urges restraint on both sides. The assumption is that there are two equally valid moral positions in this dispute, and that we must not take sides. Yet what lies behind the Israel-Palestine conflict is the systematic colonisation and ethnic cleansing of a piece of land, all of which used to be called Palestine. Theodor Herzl rightly foresaw more than 100 years ago that this would be a necessary precondition for the creation of a Jewish state. The rapid expansion of settlements and exclusive connecting roads in the West Bank and Gaza during Ehud Barak's \"liberal\" period of office is clear evidence, if any were needed, that such a policy is not just an unfortunate historical relic. Would it be going too far to suggest that successive Israeli governments bear more responsibility than the Palestinians for the present unrest? Dr Francis Clark-Lowes Palestine Solidarity Campaign A week before Ariel Sharon's cheap political stunt, I attended a conference of the International Society for Justice Research on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The last speaker was a Palestinian journalist, who gave an account of the harassment of Palestinians at the hands of Israelis, of the mockery made of legal due process when Palestinian lawyers are kept waiting outside the courtroom while their Israeli counterparts confer with the judge, of the abrogation of civil, legal and human rights. But most of all, she brought tales of routine humiliation and contempt of Palestinians. With the help of video footage, she told how the Israeli Defence Force sets up armed posts on the roofs of Palestinian houses. There is no attempt to minimise the noise or the disruption. People just have to live with it. In the case on the video, the soldiers were happy to use the roof of a house as their latrine. Their voices could be heard clearly laughing and joking together as one told the other that the latter had just pissed on the head of whoever was below. When injustice and deprivation are perceived as based upon group identity, the response is collective action. If such treatment is routine, then the expressions of frustration and fury in response to a cheap political gesture are not surprising. Rosamund Stock London School of Economics Once again (Letters, October 14), we see the old canard that wars are caused by religion. In the 20th century we have seen millions butchered by atheistic regimes, such as those of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, giving the lie to the notion that all we need to do to have peace is to eradicate religion. Humanity will always find an excuse for war - religion has simply been a convenient one throughout history. Paul Thompson Friends in Christ (Primitive Quakers)",
