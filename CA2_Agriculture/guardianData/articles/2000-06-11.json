Their re turn is due to a peculiar set of circumstances involving the venue and the nature of West Indies' batting line-up. </p> <p>The condition of the Edgbaston pitch, which for some years has been the most capricious on the English test circuit, will be particularly intriguing. Five years ago the first ball of the match from Curtly Ambrose struck a clump of grass like a head of broccoli, cleared Mike Atherton's head and almost went for six byes. Seam has been master. </p> <p>But things have quietened down this season. In three county games there have been four totals of 400 or more, including the unbroken stand of 406, little over a week ago, between the Nottinghamshire openers Darren Bicknell and Guy Welton. So, unless the test strip has reverted to type, Nasser Hussain will want to retain the balance in his attack that a spinner will bring. </p> <p>The issue is confused, however, by the plethora of left-handers in the West Indies side. In the last test they played, against Pakistan in Antigua, there were six but earlier in the year, against Zimbabwe, seven of the first eight were cack-handers. </p> <p>Now another, Brian Lara, could replace a right-hander. It is this, along with Schofield's jittery bowling at Trent Bridge, that brings Croft, who when he turns the ball can be expected to do so away from the left-hander, back into the fold. </p> <p>However, he is a lucky fellow, his inclusion coming largely because of the eight wickets he took for Glamorgan against West Indies last week on a minefield at Cardiff. Peter Such's relegation to the Essex second XI means that there is no competition, a sorry comment on the state of English spin bowling. </p> <p>No one should expect too much if Croft plays, for after a promising start his test bowling degenerated to mediocrity with only 18 wickets from the last 15 innings in which he bowled. An indication of what could happen comes from Glamorgan's match in Birmingham earlier this season when Knight, a left-hander, made 233 and Croft had fig ures of 41-11-136-1. As horses for courses go, this is running a Whitbread shire in the Derby. </p> <p>It is Ealham's ability to swing the ball into the left-hander that earns him a recall, although he will play only if conditions are heavy. The likely scenario is that Schofield will be released today to play for Lancashire against New Zealand A and that Ealham and Steve Harmison will follow him back to their counties. </p> <p>Craig White, who suffered an unexplained blackout a couple of weeks ago, begins his rehabilitation today with a match for Scarborough against the Yorkshire Academy and should be available for the second test. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Prudential, the assurance group, yesterday cut the price tag on its Egg internet banking offshoot to \u00a31.3bn, despite announcing that its flotation was nine times oversubscribed. The shares will cost 160p each, putting the stock in the top end of the recently expected 130p-175p range when trading starts today. But the valuation is still well below the more excitable suggestions of up to \u00a34bn that were common in the market prior to the sharp downward movements in hi-tech shares seen during May. Meanwhile - in a move signalling the intensifying competition in web banking - Cahoot, Abbey National's online bank, will open for business today with an offer of interest-free credit cards and overdrafts for \"at least\" the first 25,000 people to open accounts. Cahoot said also it was offering a further bundle of incentives, including \u00a310,000 overdraft limits, no \"disloyalty charge\" for using other banks' cash machines and a choice of repayment methods. In addition, it said its first 150,000 customers would be offered subsidised new generation mobile telephones, with the wireless application protocol or WAP facility, allowing users access to the internet. Egg - which has signed one million customers since its launch two years ago - is floating an 18% stake, both to give its management capital for acquisitions and to provide incentives for staff. Proceeds from the sale will net \u00a3150m for Egg and \u00a386m for Prudential. Yesterday, Prudential said the take-up of Egg shares reserved for staff and customers accounted for nearly a quarter of the equity on offer. Egg's 1,400 employees have been given \u00a3100 worth of shares free, with the chance to buy another \u00a31,000 worth. The Prudential's 17,485 UK staff along with Egg's 1m-plus customers were also given the chance to buy up to \u00a31,000 worth of shares. However, because of the quantity of applications, all those - whether Egg or Prudential employees or Egg customers - who asked for full a \u00a31,000 will be scaled back to \u00a3752, whereas those who applied for either \u00a3500 or \u00a3200 worth will receive their requests in full. Despite this initial enthusiasm for Egg - and the suggestion that the shares could reach 170p in dealings today - there remains some scepticism as to Egg's long-term potential.

In the 30-mile catchment area of the out-of-town Fosse Park shopping centre, they will be among the first to deliver a verdict on M&amp;S's desperate effort to ditch its drab image. </p> <p>Gone are the row upon row of racks stuffed with clothes and staid, beige decor. Instead, interactive touch screens help women choose bras while the walls in the children's play area are lit from within and change colour slowly during the day. Some of the shop assistants have even ditched their plain uniforms. </p> <p>It is desperate action for desperate times, critics say. Fosse Park's store is the first step, M&amp;S claims, on the road to recovery after last month's shock decision by the company to cut its dividend to shareholders for the first time in its 74-year history. </p> <p>The dividend cut followed a stunning fall from grace for a group that can track its roots back to a Leeds market stall in 1884 and which until recently was the backbone of British life. While 43% of women still wear white M&amp;S knickers, estimates by retail consultants Verdict Research show its share of the women's wear market has fallen to 13.5% from 16.19%, and to 12% from 13.9% for men. </p> <p>The secret appeared to be its high quality yet affordable St Michael label. Then the shoppers stopped streaming through doors. Smaller rivals such as Debenhams and Next courted shoppers with a trendier look, and fierce competition in the high street bought M&amp;S to its knees. </p> <p>\"It was a combination of disparate factors,\" said Richard Hyman, chairman of Verdict Research. \"The tried and tested ranges were no longer relevant for the modern market.\" </p> <p>M&amp;S fired its long-standing head, Richard Greenbury, installed new management and brought in a foreign boss, Luc Vandevelde. In a break with the past, it hired a marketing director, Alan McWalter. </p> <p>The new team's aim is to adopt the success of a big department store, bringing in a personalised service for the high street, providing everything from clothes and food to pensions and loans. Out will go the \"seas of racks\" - lines and lines of trousers, skirts and blouses - and in comes a \"store within a store\" format. </p> <p>\"What they are doing is what they needed to do to get the performance much better. They are going to break the product offering into smaller chunks,\" said Mr Hyman. </p> <p>In Fosse Park, the store is split into sections, with different areas within men's wear, women's wear, food, home, the new \"beauty hall\" and the new baby and maternity range. M&amp;S is trying to emulate the \"customer is king\" attitude of its bigger, brasher American cousins. </p> <p>So, women purchasing the clothes from the new upmarket Autograph range will have each item wrapped in tissue paper by chic, black-clad shop assistants. </p> <p><strong> Revamped</strong><br> </p> <p>In other parts of the store, manager Andrew Jackson hopes his male customer will sit in the revamped sportswear section, watching a vast TV screen while his wife \"spends \u00a3500\" elsewhere in the shop. </p> <p>\"It's much improved,\" was an early verdict from one Fosse Park shopper, Steve Bell, 41, who used to work for one of the group's local suppliers, many of which have now been ditched by M&amp;S for foreign manufacturers. </p> <p>\"I can see they have split it all up,\" he says, carrying an armful of casual trousers and shorts towards the fitting rooms. </p> <p>To Mr Bell, the new display makes the clothes look different, which is not always the case. It is an effect that Mr McWalter, the newly recruited marketing director, sums up by talking about \"lifestyle issues\" and a \"leisure experience\". It is all about customer-friendly presentation, the result of scrutinising the habits of its 3.5m chargecard holders. Few stones have been left unturned, it appears. Even the dirty green carrier bags have been replaced by brighter version. </p> <p>Yet, while many of the changes appear shallow alterations to the image and presentation of the same old items, underneath there are attempts to instill substantial cultural change. </p> <p>Last month's sacking of 75 middle managers halved the ratio of bosses to non-bosses to one to 10. For the first time, the paternal, control-freakish M&amp;S gave staff the power to make decisions. </p> <p>\"People can always give more when they've got the freedom to do so. No one at home tells you when to go to tea, so why should you need someone at work?\" says Richard Wolff, divisional director of M&amp;S. </p> <p>Fosse Park is one of three experimental stores to receive the makeover before M&amp;S decides whether to roll it out nationwide. Sutton in Surrey was the first and Kensington in London will be next. </p> <p>After three days' of takings at Fosse Park, M&amp;S is optimistic, claiming it is \"ahead of estimates\". It is still early days, though, and analysts say the tills will need to start ringing all around the country if M&amp;S is to prove that its recent performance can be consigned to history. </p> <p><strong> M&amp;S: What's in and what's out</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Out</strong> </p> <p>Row upon row of clothes rails </p> <p>Strip lighting </p> <p>Control from the centre </p> <p>Blacks and greys </p> <p>Dirty green plastic bags </p> <p><strong> In</strong> </p> <p>\"Stores within stores\" </p> <p>Neon lights </p> <p>Retrained staff </p> <p>Colours </p> <p>Maternity wear, nursery, furniture and prams </p> <p>Beauty halls </p> <p>Cafes </p> <p>Credit cards </p> <p>Bright plastic bags</p>",

After years in which the two airlines have been locked in acrimonious courtroom and media battles over alleged \"dirty tricks\", attempts will be made to exploit the close personal relationship between Mr Branson and Mr Eddington in order to call a truce. With the threat of an open skies policy likely to hit the bottom line of both airlines, the two companies are eager to bury the hatchet after years in which their relationship has been soured by commercial rivalry and personal animosity.

      "body": "<p>Having sorted out the new deal and the old Labourites, it was only a matter of time before Tony and his cronies turned their attention to the real issue of the day: the forces of fashion conservatism. In true laid-back new Labour fashion, Blair has finally confessed to his hatred of smart dress codes at work. \"It's one of the tyrannies of modern life that men have to dress in conventional suits the whole time,\" he lamented in an interview with a women's magazine. The Prime Minister's mufti of choice is - appropriately - a denim shirt, the informal uniform of the mildly fashionable man. \"I'm trying to get out of suits,\" he confessed. </p> <p>And who, irrespective of gender or job, could disagree? Surely only old stick-in-the-muds such as hereditary peers actually like wearing suits, right? We're all one big Silicon Valley now, dressed in unisex Gap chinos and crisp white T-shirts, working harder than ever, but free at last from the stuffy tyranny of necktie or nylons. New Labour, new look. </p> <p>It was in the internet start-ups of California and Seattle that casual dressing in the white-collar workplace began in earnest in the mid-80s. The idea of forcing iconoclastic innovators to wrap a tie around their necks or wear Edwina Currie-style power-suits seemed contrary to the very spirit of the new technological revolution - young, dynamic and creative. The success of industries such as Microsoft and Netscape created speculation that profits were inversely related to the buttoned-down formality of other industries. Not surprisingly, the new look caught on. By the mid-90s, \"dress-down Fridays\" were commonplace in the UK; by the millennium every day had become dress-down day for some firms - even in parts of the Square Mile. </p> <p>But has the PM once again failed to catch the mood of the nation? Do we really want to go to work in civvies? \"The reality is that given the chance, most employees would go straight back to posh gear tomorrow morning,\" says Judi James, a professional image adviser and author of Body Talk, a guide book for dressing for success. \"They are totally bemused by the millennial dress code of 'smart-casual'. I recently trained a man who truly thought it meant being both at once. He wore a formal waistcoat and trousers with a Grateful Dead T-shirt. Whereas buying traditional suits requires half a brain cell, people find it stressful to learn a whole new set of rules.\" </p> <p>Anthea Yamey, a trainer in impression management, has been employed by companies including KPMG to guide employees through this fashion minefield. \"A few years ago, people like me were few and far between. But employers are now beginning to realise the impact that getting the new look 'wrong' can have on business. Is it OK, for instance, for top PAs to replace jackets with cardigans? To wear flowing flowery dresses instead of tailored suits? In some firms, of course, it's no problem, but in others it could lose them a deal.\" </p> <p>In any case, more freedom means more room for mistakes, points out Christine Abbot, manager of personal shopping at Harvey Nichols. If in doubt, cast your mind back to William Hague's notorious informal brainstorming weekend which he attended with jumper-clad shadow cabinet members. John Redwood even turned up in combat trousers, like some cross between a chief exec and an All Saint. Hague's intentions were good, but such were the horrors of the style-free zone on display that the Tories' ratings dropped a few inches on the graph that week. </p> <p>\"Employers are realising that with the increase in short-term contracts, employees are dazed by the variety in rules according to each company,\" says Abbot. So bewildered are employees in Citibank, Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, for instance, that managers have had to provide written guidelines on what constitutes \"acceptable casual\". \"Sometimes, it seems like an enforced freedom, because what counts as casual is more restrictive than a classic suit,\" says a PA at Merrill Lynch. Little wonder that one survey found only a third of businesspeople want to look casual at the office all the time. And over half of the staff at Arthur Anderson, which announced in January that its 7,000 UK staff would be free to wear whatever they wanted, still choose to sport formal suits. </p> <p>Christopher Early, a professor of organisational behaviour at the University of Indiana, believes that introducing casual wear \"can be read as just another attempt to manipulate employees\". He adds that it also runs the risk of taking on an Orwellian quality. \"All of us are casual, but some are more casual than others . . .\" The bohemian argument that informal dress de-layers management structures, leading to a more equal working environment, also doesn't wash with Dr Rob Briner, an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck College in London. \"When a company goes casual, it becomes very clear who has the money to spend on an impressive wardrobe and who doesn't.

It's tempting not to bother in a climate where so many meetings have been replaced by emails and telephone conferencing, but there's always someone you'll have to impress - especially as a front-line secretary or PA.

      "bodyText": "Having sorted out the new deal and the old Labourites, it was only a matter of time before Tony and his cronies turned their attention to the real issue of the day: the forces of fashion conservatism. In true laid-back new Labour fashion, Blair has finally confessed to his hatred of smart dress codes at work. \"It's one of the tyrannies of modern life that men have to dress in conventional suits the whole time,\" he lamented in an interview with a women's magazine. The Prime Minister's mufti of choice is - appropriately - a denim shirt, the informal uniform of the mildly fashionable man. \"I'm trying to get out of suits,\" he confessed. And who, irrespective of gender or job, could disagree? Surely only old stick-in-the-muds such as hereditary peers actually like wearing suits, right? We're all one big Silicon Valley now, dressed in unisex Gap chinos and crisp white T-shirts, working harder than ever, but free at last from the stuffy tyranny of necktie or nylons. New Labour, new look. It was in the internet start-ups of California and Seattle that casual dressing in the white-collar workplace began in earnest in the mid-80s. The idea of forcing iconoclastic innovators to wrap a tie around their necks or wear Edwina Currie-style power-suits seemed contrary to the very spirit of the new technological revolution - young, dynamic and creative. The success of industries such as Microsoft and Netscape created speculation that profits were inversely related to the buttoned-down formality of other industries. Not surprisingly, the new look caught on. By the mid-90s, \"dress-down Fridays\" were commonplace in the UK; by the millennium every day had become dress-down day for some firms - even in parts of the Square Mile. But has the PM once again failed to catch the mood of the nation? Do we really want to go to work in civvies? \"The reality is that given the chance, most employees would go straight back to posh gear tomorrow morning,\" says Judi James, a professional image adviser and author of Body Talk, a guide book for dressing for success. \"They are totally bemused by the millennial dress code of 'smart-casual'. I recently trained a man who truly thought it meant being both at once. He wore a formal waistcoat and trousers with a Grateful Dead T-shirt. Whereas buying traditional suits requires half a brain cell, people find it stressful to learn a whole new set of rules.\" Anthea Yamey, a trainer in impression management, has been employed by companies including KPMG to guide employees through this fashion minefield. \"A few years ago, people like me were few and far between. But employers are now beginning to realise the impact that getting the new look 'wrong' can have on business. Is it OK, for instance, for top PAs to replace jackets with cardigans? To wear flowing flowery dresses instead of tailored suits? In some firms, of course, it's no problem, but in others it could lose them a deal.\" In any case, more freedom means more room for mistakes, points out Christine Abbot, manager of personal shopping at Harvey Nichols. If in doubt, cast your mind back to William Hague's notorious informal brainstorming weekend which he attended with jumper-clad shadow cabinet members. John Redwood even turned up in combat trousers, like some cross between a chief exec and an All Saint. Hague's intentions were good, but such were the horrors of the style-free zone on display that the Tories' ratings dropped a few inches on the graph that week. \"Employers are realising that with the increase in short-term contracts, employees are dazed by the variety in rules according to each company,\" says Abbot. So bewildered are employees in Citibank, Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, for instance, that managers have had to provide written guidelines on what constitutes \"acceptable casual\". \"Sometimes, it seems like an enforced freedom, because what counts as casual is more restrictive than a classic suit,\" says a PA at Merrill Lynch. Little wonder that one survey found only a third of businesspeople want to look casual at the office all the time. And over half of the staff at Arthur Anderson, which announced in January that its 7,000 UK staff would be free to wear whatever they wanted, still choose to sport formal suits. Christopher Early, a professor of organisational behaviour at the University of Indiana, believes that introducing casual wear \"can be read as just another attempt to manipulate employees\". He adds that it also runs the risk of taking on an Orwellian quality. \"All of us are casual, but some are more casual than others . . .\" The bohemian argument that informal dress de-layers management structures, leading to a more equal working environment, also doesn't wash with Dr Rob Briner, an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck College in London. \"When a company goes casual, it becomes very clear who has the money to spend on an impressive wardrobe and who doesn't.

Sweden's hopes dwindled further ten minutes from the end when Patrik Andersson was dismissed for fouling Goor, his second booking. Nothing could detract from the joy of Waseige's men, who deserved to milk their bows at the end. For a nation who haven't even taken part in the European Championship finals since 1984, this is one to relish.",

      "body": "<p>England dare not ignore the facts. The West Indies, by conservative estimate, will have six left-handers in their line-up at Edgbaston on Thursday, five of them serious batsmen. And England's recent record against left-handers is appalling. </p> <p>Left-handers have tormented them over the last decade. Since Mark Taylor hit 219 at Nottingham in 1989, English bowlers have conceded seven double centuries in Test cricket. All of them have been scored by left-handers. Our bowlers tend to be neutered by anyone who bats the wrong way round. In chronological order England's tormentors have been Taylor, Aamir Sohail, Vinod Kambli, Allan Border, Brian Lara, Gary Kirsten, Sinath Jayasuriya and Kirsten again. </p> <p>The West Indian southpaws come in all shapes and sizes. There's Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who still looks as if he's turned up straight from school, even if he made his Test debut in 1993, and captain Jimmy Adams, who might have been coached by Brian Bolus so often does he use his pads. The latest is Wavell Hinds, who likes to beat the ball. Ridley Jacobs is a burly and uncomplicated keeper/batsman and there's a chap called Lara. </p> <p>Brian Lara's trials have provided some good copy since the West Indies have arrived in England. There's even been the suggestion that he might not play at Edgbaston. Ask the England dressing room whether they would like him in or out of the side and you would get a unanimous response. Lara will be there at one of his favourite hunting grounds and whether he scores runs at Arundel against the Zimbabweans this weekend or not he remains the most feared member of the West Indian line-up. </p> <p>His rehabilitation has been hindered by a terrible pitch at Cardiff. The West Indies have not complained though they had every right to. Some England touring sides would have been up in arms if they had such a dire surface on which to prepare for an overseas Test match, but the West Indies rolled up their sleeves impressively and won by 21 runs. In the process Nixon McLean threatened the current pecking order among the West Indian pacemen. </p> <p>Lara was not alone in struggling at Cardiff and I suspect he will be ready and most definitely hungry by Thursday along with his fellow left-handers. How will England's attack - the trio of pacemen are bound to stay the same despite the lack-lustre performance at Trent Bridge - cope with them all? Andy Caddick can take the wickets of left-handers but he is undoubtedly more vulnerable against them as well. His method is geared to bowling at right-handers; to shape the ball away and to aim for steep bounce around off-stump, which keeps the slip cordon busy. His margin for error is reduced significantly when trying to swing the ball back into left-handers. When the two sides last met Lara, in particular, chose to take the attack to him, and he was rattled by the assault. This duel will be fascinating. </p> <p>Gough at his best threatens them with the new ball. His spell at Lord's in the second innings against Zimbabwe, when he dismissed Alistair Campbell and Andy Flower in quick succession with late in-swing was awesome. But when the ball is older his reverse swing is not so potent to left-handers. Ed Giddins has a reputation of being good at left-handers since he has the capacity to seam the ball away from them. He'll have ample opportunity to justify that at Edgbaston. </p> <p>Now to Chris Schofield. Leg spin is less threatening to the left-hander, which is one reason why I would not play him at Edgbaston. Another is that he is patently not ready for Test cricket. It still bewilders me that he was given a central contract, which deliv ers the tacit message that those at the centre do not trust the coaching staffs at the counties to develop young players. Yet who is the coach at Lancashire? Bobby Simpson, who oversaw the emergence of Shane Warne and who probably knows more about wrist spinners (he was a good one himself) than anyone else over here. </p> <p>Schofield, whose promise I recognise, has much to learn and I don't think his education would be enhanced by bowling at a battery of left-handers at Edgbaston. Nor would England's chances of winning the match. So Robert Croft should be recalled, partly because I can't think of anyone else, partly because he has just bowled well against the tourists at Cardiff - even though conditions were stacked in his favour - partly because off-spinners are more dangerous against left-handers. They have a better chance of finding the edge and of containing the batsmen, which is one of the spinner's roles in the modern game. </p> <p>Other changes of personnel will have been discussed by the selectors last night. Andrew Flintoff was woeful against the swinging ball at Trent Bridge, leaden-footed and slow in thought. He may prefer to face an attack that sets little store by swing. England will - and probably should - retain him, but time is ticking by and the Lancashire player has still not yet made a meaningful contribution in his eight Test matches. </p> <p>Nick Knight also looked technically bereft at Trent Bridge, with his head falling towards cover point against the inswinger. Here my inclination would be to replace him with Michael Vaughan, in the runs immediately on his return to the Yorkshire side after injury. </p> <p>I would also be keen to recall one of England's wayward left-handers, Graham Thorpe, but he's still stuck in a deep trough. As I mentioned last week Thorpe is a quality player, but he's not Brian Lara; so he has to wait his turn.</p> <p><strong> Double centurions who have tormented England </strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Taylor (Aus)</strong> st Russell b Cook <strong> 219</strong> Nottingham - 1989 </p> <p><strong> Aamir Sohail (Pak)</strong> b Lewis <strong> 205</strong> Manchester - 1992 </p> <p><strong> Vinod Kambli (Ind)</strong> c Gatting b Lewis <strong> 224</strong> Bombay - 1993 </p> <p><strong> Allan Border (Aus)</strong> <strong> 200no</strong> </p> <p>Leeds - 1993 </p> <p><strong> Brian Lara (WI)</strong> c Russell b Caddick <strong> 375</strong> St John's - 1994 </p> <p><strong> Gary Kirsten (SA)</strong> c Stewart b Fraser <strong> 210</strong> </p> <p>Manchester - 1998 </p> <p><strong> Sinath Jayasuriya (SL)</strong> c Stewart b Fraser <strong> 213</strong> c Stewart b B Hollioake The Oval - 1998 </p> <p><strong> Gary Kirsten (SA)</strong> b Butcher <strong> 275</strong> Durban - 1999 </p>",

      "body": "<p> A golden age of English cricket .... and the West Indians beaten by an innings. Those were the days! Exactly 100 years ago in fact. A century ago today the West Indians played their first game in England in a tough baptism against a powerful London County side at Crystal Palace. </p> <p>Appropriately for such an historic occasion the incomparable Dr W.G. Grace, then still a formidable force, faced the first ball they bowled here. The doctor, the driving force behind the County, had selected a 'capital' eleven that included, in addition to himself, Billy Murdoch, the former Australian captain who had settled in this country, and a leavening of players with Test Match experience.</p> <p>Against this combination the tourists mustered what was really an ensemble rather than a team. In those days of long sea-journeys between territories they had not played together before. Several had not gone beyond their own island, found three-day cricket to be a strain, and the climate and pitches of even a good English summer quite foreign. Woods, the leading quick bowler, often lost heart, and once asked if he could bowl without boots so he could feel the earth beneath his feet.</p> <p>These tourists were essentially a melange of the white plantocracy with the right social and educational connections and black labourers a generation or two out of slavery. The latter were tested socially, too, as black faces in the cricketing ranks were less than few and far between. Some could not take time off from work and duties, or afford to be away, for such a long tour. The absentees included leading batsman Harold Austin, a future captain, who was fighting in the South African War.</p> <p> Yet they had performed well enough on their own pitches against largely amateur visiting teams from England to merit - at the persistence of Lord Hawke with Dr Grace's support - a chance to test their worth against England's best. The visitors admitted freely that they had 'come to learn'.</p> <p> The game itself was no match at all. From the moment openers Grace and Gilman set off with a 138-run partnership the bowlers knew that they were out of their depth and in for the thrashing which century-makers Mason, possibly then the best all-rounder in the country, and Parkes administered. Facing a 538-run total the visitors lost four early wickets - three to Grace - before Goodman and Cox offered their only real resistance. Both passed 50, but when they were out Mason routed the lower-order. Handicapped by deteriorating ground conditions in the follow-on 301 runs behind, the West Indians were shot out again by Grace and Mason as the County triumphed by an innings and 198 runs.</p> <p> Most of the ensuing games went the same way. There were successes, too, among the losses. Minor Counties at Northampton provided the first West Indian victory in England, Leicestershire the first over a county, and Surrey, outplayed by an innings, a prestigious scalp. Wisden commented: 'As an experiment the tour was extremely interesting and far more successful than might have been expected.'</p> <p> C.A. Ollivierre led the batting, sharing in two double-century first-wicket partnerships. Wisden : 'considering his opportunities of playing cricket in St Vincent must have been very limited, his performance was remarkable'. Ollivierre returned to play with distinction for Derbyshire, forerunner of his now plentiful compatriots who have made a career in the county championship.</p> <p> Lebrun Constantine scored the West Indians' first century on the hallowed turf at Lord's: his son Learie would make his own mark there and at many other grounds. Another name associated with Lord's - the name associated with Lord's - Pelham Warner, hit a hundred against Leicestershire in his only innings for his native region. He was born in Trinidad and his brother, Aucher, was the tourists' captain. In his tour report Pelham Warner wrote that there were 'plenty of good cricketers scattered over the islands'.</p> <p> Woods, who had already rattled teams visiting the Caribbean, shared with Burton in bowling out Norfolk for just 32 runs in the last innings of the tour. These players would come again and how they have learned _ to the extent that we are celebrating this summer the fiftieth anniversary of West Indies winning their first Test match, and series, in England and twenty-fifth anniversary of them winning the first World Cup. Now they are here again - as Wisden foresaw 'Englishmen will be right glad to welcome another West Indian eleven'. </p> <p>Just what the good doctor would have ordered. </p>",

Facing a 538-run total the visitors lost four early wickets - three to Grace - before Goodman and Cox offered their only real resistance. Both passed 50, but when they were out Mason routed the lower-order. Handicapped by deteriorating ground conditions in the follow-on 301 runs behind, the West Indians were shot out again by Grace and Mason as the County triumphed by an innings and 198 runs. Most of the ensuing games went the same way. There were successes, too, among the losses. Minor Counties at Northampton provided the first West Indian victory in England, Leicestershire the first over a county, and Surrey, outplayed by an innings, a prestigious scalp. Wisden commented: 'As an experiment the tour was extremely interesting and far more successful than might have been expected.' C.A. Ollivierre led the batting, sharing in two double-century first-wicket partnerships. Wisden : 'considering his opportunities of playing cricket in St Vincent must have been very limited, his performance was remarkable'. Ollivierre returned to play with distinction for Derbyshire, forerunner of his now plentiful compatriots who have made a career in the county championship. Lebrun Constantine scored the West Indians' first century on the hallowed turf at Lord's: his son Learie would make his own mark there and at many other grounds. Another name associated with Lord's - the name associated with Lord's - Pelham Warner, hit a hundred against Leicestershire in his only innings for his native region. He was born in Trinidad and his brother, Aucher, was the tourists' captain. In his tour report Pelham Warner wrote that there were 'plenty of good cricketers scattered over the islands'. Woods, who had already rattled teams visiting the Caribbean, shared with Burton in bowling out Norfolk for just 32 runs in the last innings of the tour. These players would come again and how they have learned _ to the extent that we are celebrating this summer the fiftieth anniversary of West Indies winning their first Test match, and series, in England and twenty-fifth anniversary of them winning the first World Cup. Now they are here again - as Wisden foresaw 'Englishmen will be right glad to welcome another West Indian eleven'. Just what the good doctor would have ordered.",

The outstanding individual performance may have come from a Welshman - or at least an adopted one - Matthew Maynard, but Gloucestershire under the calm guidance of Alleyne were patently the superior team. </p> <p>Their bowlers, pop-gunners in the longer game, but now schooled and confident in one-day cricket were all on target; their batsmen all contributed and for good measure their fielders were as sharp as ever, grabbing two straightforward run-outs. Their target of 226 caused few alarms once Kim Barnett, a month away from his fortieth birthday, and Tim Hancock had launched the innings with an opening partnership of 80 in 16 overs. They cruised home by seven wickets with 3.1 overs to spare. Fittingly Alleyne was still there to make the winning hit, though for most of his innings he could look on admiringly as Matt Windows in a romp to the tape, kept hoisting the ball to the legside boundary. </p> <p>The Welsh bowlers appeared neutered when bowling on a proper pitch. At Cardiff last week they could bowl a full length with impunity. Such deliveries merely shuddered the bottom of West Indian bats and went nowhere; short ones double declutched on landing and limped along the ground. Here on a blameless surface the batsmen could take liberties; half-volleys were pummelled; short balls bounced and could be attacked and Hancock, Barnett, Alleyne and Windows all enjoyed themselves. </p> <p>Suddenly those bowlers that had paralysed Lara and his fellow West Indies were impotent against stalwart county pros. Glamorgan cricket and cricketers will only continue to prosper if they sort out their square. </p> <p>But for Maynard we would not have had a game at all. He had to wait 16 years for the chance to display his talents in a Lord's final, but when it came he did not spurn it. Maynard is old by modern cricketing standards, but not that old. He's 34 and wasn't around when Glamorgan made their last visit to Lord's in 1977. He may also be at his peak. Yesterday he stroked a century that was flawless in judgment and execution until the final over when he erroneously sacrificed the strike. He was a rare man of the match award winner to find himself on the losing side. </p> <p>Maynard has not always been so serene when responsibility has been tossed on to his shoulders. In four Test matches and 10 one-day internationals for England he failed to make an impact. We all waited for him to erupt with breathtaking strokeplay that was so familiar on the county circuit. Yesterday there were no explosions either, but this is because Maynard has matured. His strokeplay now is more calculating; he now assesses the risks and takes fewer chances. </p> <p>So while his 100 was sprinkled with drives and pulls of the highest quality, there was nothing too audacious; the ball was kept on the ground; the shots were orthodox. Like other one-day 'experts' such as Neil Fairbrother he has learnt not to strive for breathtaking boundaries all the time. He now appreciates singles as well. </p> <p>If it wasn't for his age and a modest record he would surely be inked into England's one day squad for the triangular series. He may still be considered for Duncan Fletcher is well aware of his capabilities, though his selection would not tie in with David Graveney's declared concern to prepare for the next World Cup in three year's time. </p> <p>Maynard, having won the toss, was at the crease by the ninth over. Glamorgan stuck to their policy of opening with Robert Croft even though this ploy seems to waste the talents of an in-form Steve James as well as the sparkiness of Croft down the order. </p> <p>Croft cunningly batted eighteen inches outside his crease to combat the swing of Mike Smith but soon fell at the other end, undone by Harvey's away swing. So was Matthew Elliott, who was bowled off the inside edge. </p> <p>Now Maynard joined forces with Michael Powell in the only significant partnership of the innings - 137 from 31 overs. Maynard easily outpaced Powell because he always seemed to hit the gaps. None the less Powell's innings hinted at his promise. There were some superbly struck drives that often hit the field. Powell is one to follow. He is predominantly a front-foot player. Who wouldn't be when nurtured at Cardiff? </p> <p>As the score mounted Alleyne shuffled his bowlers astutely and none of them let him down. But he had to wait until the fortieth over when his sixth bowler, the off-spinner Jeremy Snape induced Powell to return a straightforward catch. Even though Maynard stayed until the last over the Glamorgan innings now lost momentum as Alleyne's team closed in. From 161-2 in the fortieth over they subsided to 225 all out with three balls still remaining </p> <p>There were a couple of run-outs and Harvey, who finished with the exceptional figures of five for 34, which were not at all flattering, was typically adept in those closing overs.

      "body": "<p>As Herschelle Gibbs and others turn on Hansie Cronje in Cape Town and pour out the confessions that could sink not only their former Springbok captain but the entire game of international cricket, you cannot help but notice certain similarities between South Africa and Wales. </p> <p>OK, I know that Monnow Valley Vineyards are hardly Stellenbosch Wineries and the Brecon Beacons are mere bumps alongside the Drakensbergs, but for every flat-earth Afrikaner fundamentalist there has to be a lunatic Welsh-speaking Salem-Bethesda chapel-goer who, in a moment of weakness has like Cronje, let Satan enter. </p> <p>And since Glamorgan are essentially Wales when it comes to cricket you could not help wonder what was going on in Jack Brown the Bookmakers every time something negative happened out in the middle. Two leading-edge dismissals from Robert Croft and Keith Newell must, however, be hard to manufacture. </p> <p>On the other hand, the odds were probably very good. 'Bombay calling Bedlinog; 120,00 rupee-rand says Croftee-Sahib cannot edge one to mid-off in the seventh over.' The Welsh offer far more cunning than Herschelle Gibbs, whose dropped World Cup catch against Australia was amateur panto. </p> <p>The Welsh are also better on stage and under interrogation. The trouble with Truth and Reconciliation Commissions is that they encourage people to, er, tell the truth. This would never do in Wales where story-telling, gloomy irony and sick-notes are national institutions. </p> <p>Grown men simply do not burst into tears at the first tricky question from a posh bloke in a wig. When a rebel Welsh tour went to South Africa in the early 90s, did anybody crack, even when put on the rack by the Grand Inquisitor Vernon Pugh? You can bet they didn't. </p> <p>Mind you, no Welsh captain would be allowed to do what Cronje apparently did and keep a handsome proportion of the bung for himself. That would have been unfair. Matthew Maynard is far too honourable, although, come to think of it, he did display a greedy side to his nature by hogging half the Glamorgan total for himself with an innings of 104.. </p> <p>In all truth it is probably stretching things a little far to imagine that Glamorgan had let Satan in. You know those similarities between the Jappies and the Taffs? Well, to be honest, Cape Town is a long way from Splott. </p> <p>But what about Gloucestershire? Up on the High Veld of the Cotswolds might there be some disenchanted Wesleyan enclave dancing by moonlight with Old Nick and prepared to wage class war on cricket? A sort of post-Methodist November 17 group spurred into direct action when their Lottery application for a new thatched roof on the pavilion was turned down? </p> <p>Don't scoff. What did Matt Windows use to do in the winter? Work for Sporting Index, the spread-betters, that's what. If Bourton-on-the-Water CC have a makeover because Kim Barnett and Tim Hancock took 49 balls to knock off the first 50 in their reply to Glamorgan's score, then I think Judge Edwin King should be asking some pretty stern questions in Cape Town.

      "bodyText": "As Herschelle Gibbs and others turn on Hansie Cronje in Cape Town and pour out the confessions that could sink not only their former Springbok captain but the entire game of international cricket, you cannot help but notice certain similarities between South Africa and Wales. OK, I know that Monnow Valley Vineyards are hardly Stellenbosch Wineries and the Brecon Beacons are mere bumps alongside the Drakensbergs, but for every flat-earth Afrikaner fundamentalist there has to be a lunatic Welsh-speaking Salem-Bethesda chapel-goer who, in a moment of weakness has like Cronje, let Satan enter. And since Glamorgan are essentially Wales when it comes to cricket you could not help wonder what was going on in Jack Brown the Bookmakers every time something negative happened out in the middle. Two leading-edge dismissals from Robert Croft and Keith Newell must, however, be hard to manufacture. On the other hand, the odds were probably very good. 'Bombay calling Bedlinog; 120,00 rupee-rand says Croftee-Sahib cannot edge one to mid-off in the seventh over.' The Welsh offer far more cunning than Herschelle Gibbs, whose dropped World Cup catch against Australia was amateur panto. The Welsh are also better on stage and under interrogation. The trouble with Truth and Reconciliation Commissions is that they encourage people to, er, tell the truth. This would never do in Wales where story-telling, gloomy irony and sick-notes are national institutions. Grown men simply do not burst into tears at the first tricky question from a posh bloke in a wig. When a rebel Welsh tour went to South Africa in the early 90s, did anybody crack, even when put on the rack by the Grand Inquisitor Vernon Pugh? You can bet they didn't. Mind you, no Welsh captain would be allowed to do what Cronje apparently did and keep a handsome proportion of the bung for himself. That would have been unfair. Matthew Maynard is far too honourable, although, come to think of it, he did display a greedy side to his nature by hogging half the Glamorgan total for himself with an innings of 104.. In all truth it is probably stretching things a little far to imagine that Glamorgan had let Satan in. You know those similarities between the Jappies and the Taffs? Well, to be honest, Cape Town is a long way from Splott. But what about Gloucestershire? Up on the High Veld of the Cotswolds might there be some disenchanted Wesleyan enclave dancing by moonlight with Old Nick and prepared to wage class war on cricket? A sort of post-Methodist November 17 group spurred into direct action when their Lottery application for a new thatched roof on the pavilion was turned down? Don't scoff. What did Matt Windows use to do in the winter? Work for Sporting Index, the spread-betters, that's what. If Bourton-on-the-Water CC have a makeover because Kim Barnett and Tim Hancock took 49 balls to knock off the first 50 in their reply to Glamorgan's score, then I think Judge Edwin King should be asking some pretty stern questions in Cape Town. And, closer to home, why, after years of corruption in the Cotswolds, have the police not made a single arrest? Not even Jilly Cooper. I apologise. Lord's was bathed in sunlight, the trains pulled into Paddington from the West alive with intermingling bonhomie and everybody down there in white in the homely bowl of the headquarters of the game was giving it their all. God, please re-enter Hansie's life. If this is all a sham, then we may as well all pack up and go home to watch wrestling on pay-per-view. I had to find something positive on which to cling. There was the bowling action of Jeremy Snape, who, strike me down, was the spitting image of our own Vic Marks when he wheeled for Somerset. If he just drops his hands a bit in his run-up. Ah, refuge in the past. I found I used to play club cricket against the fathers of Michael Powell and Adrian Dale. John and John of Abergavenny and Chepstow respectively. Now, those were the days... So, there you have it. A day that swung between cynical suspicion of sport in modern times and a rather doddering retreat into times past. Cricket all over. Reality, though, must lie somewhere between the two and maybe a few strokes were pulled in the days of WG Grace to put a new bed of thatch on the roof of a Cotswold pavilion.

But not Brian Charles Lara. </p> <p>Against only the third ball he faced yesterday, from Neil Johnson, who had claimed both the wickets the West Indians had lost in crawling to 55, he lifted his bat high and cracked it through point for the first of the 25 fours he struck, not forgetting five sixes, in a glorious 176 which left no doubt that his powers remain undiminished. </p> <p>A Zimbabwean attack of near Test strength was immediately placed under seige. Brian Strang was twice driven straight, pre-empting his immediate withdrawal from the attack. Pommie Mbangwa - who, a fortnight ago, had bowled out Yorkshire almost singlehandedly - was twice hoisted over mid-wicket and, in between, driven, cut and pulled for three fours. A backfoot drive over extra-cover's head propelled Lara to his fifty off only 43 balls. </p> <p>Lara's feet twinkled and his bat, lifted high, swung through with grace. The matchless splendour of Arundel Castle's ground and a large, sun-drenched crowd had Lara inspired. Having come in 16 minutes after lunch, Lara was well past his hundred at tea and the next 50 came from 45 balls. </p> <p>From being audacious, Lara then became reckless. A couple of big hits were miscued and then, hitting right across the 163rd ball he received, from Bryan Strang, he was bowled. </p> <p>The Zimbabweans stood up bravely to Lara's onslaught and did not lose their humour. Left-arm spinner Dirk Viljoen, who had been driven high for two sixes in the previous over, celebrated a maiden with high-fives. </p> <p>Sherwin Campbell, who remained unbeaten with 141, was at his most fluent when he was in the company of Lara for 51 overs, during which 276 runs were added. Some of Lara's brilliance rubbed off on him and he played some handsome cover-drives. </p> <p>For all of the morning, Campbell's main preoccupation had been the building of a foundation to the innings. The West Indians had been put in on a pitch that had traces of damp after being under covers during a very wet Friday. </p> <p>It was slow in pace and the bounce was low, but did afford some movement to the seamers. Adrian Griffith was trapped lbw to one that kept low, the score then only nine. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was hard put to pierce the field and, in a stay of 110 minutes, could muster only 17 runs before Johnson found his edge for a slip catch. </p> <p>Campbell, making ample use of the bottom hand to try to force the ball away, was on 31 when he was joined by Lara. He was on 118 when Lara left him, having taken 252 balls to reach his hundred, with 14 fours. </p> <p>A collapse followed Lara's exit. Jimmy Adams went in the same over, caught at gulley. Young Ramnaresh Sarwan played right across the line and became Strang's third victim, and Ridley Jacobs, the fifth of six left-handers in the order, was defeated by an in-swinger of full length from Mbangwa, reducing the West Indians to 338 for six. </p> <p>It would seem that the West Indians would have appreciated at least one more match before the first Test, beginning at Edgbaston on Thursday. Their batting line-up would depend on the extent of Wavell Hinds's recovery from an Achilles tendon injury and if he is fit, they might consider leaving out Griffith and promoting Chanderpaul, who made a century at Worcester, to open the innings with Campbell. </p> <p>Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, who did much hard work during the two series at home in the winter, will go into the Test cold. They were again kept under wraps. Of the other four pace bowlers in the party, Reon King was also rested while Nixon McLean, well experienced to bowl in English conditions after his stint with Hampshire, must be a strong contender after taking ten wickets in the first two matches. </p>",

      "body": "<p>There's a 'fact' doing the rounds that claims Australia has more ballet dancers per capita than any other country. It's probably urban myth, along the lines of the Swedish suicide rate or the six degrees of separation. And what is certain is that no one in the film business believes it. When Ridley Scott was trying to think of an actor who was tough enough to play the lead in Gladiator, he considered Mel Gibson, then decided he was too old and went for Russell Crowe. </p> <p>Because as far as the movies are concerned, being 'Australian' is a guarantee of uninhibited masculinity. Which might just explain the otherwise unlikely choice of Perth-born Heath Ledger to play Gibson's son in the new American Revolution epic, The Patriot. </p> <p>'From what I've seen, it is absolutely the most perfect time for Australians to be here,' Ledger says. Unlike the New Zealand-born Crowe or the New York State-spawned Gibson, the 21-year-old Ledger is unambiguously Australian. </p> <p>But like them, he looks like he could be handier in a fight than your average young Hollywoodite. In Ten Things I Hate About You, last year's teen Taming Of The Shrew reworking, Ledger's hulking build and wild hair made him seem older than most of his co-stars, even though he was actually a rare real teenager in a high-school movie. </p> <p>Ledger started acting at 12, and did the usual Australian TV thing, including a spot on Home And Away and a series called Sweat in which, intriguingly, he played a gay cyclist. That led to Roar, which was a short lived American made but Queensland based series with Ledger getting to show off his brawn in the role of a fifth-century Celtic warrior. Although the show is still fondly remembered by pubescent American girls, it only lasted a season. </p> <p>But not long after that, Ledger got the part of Patrick in Ten Things I Hate About You and the lead in Two Hands, a darkly comic thriller that was a big hit back in Australia. All in all, it seems like a pretty smooth rise. </p> <p>Next up he'll be taking top billing in A Knight's Tale, a medieval adventure by Payback director Brian Helgeland. But Ledger's big showcase is The Patriot, made by the Independence Day team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich and clearly aimed at the Braveheart niche in the cinema market. As the vehemently anti-British son, Ledger is the one who spurs the initially reluctant hero (Gibson) into action. </p> <p>'He's incredibly quick,' Gibson says. 'I recall how shit scared he was when we first started, but we joked around, as guys do, and before long, he fitted in perfectly.' </p> <p>But maybe Heath Ledger isn't quite as much of a pure Aussie bloke as everyone thinks. He couldn't manage to be stoic through the eighteenth-century soldiering required for the part, refusing to hide the pain when he shred a finger firing a musket. 'I wasn't a brave soldier,' he confesses.<br> </p> <p>Five things you should know about Heath Ledger:</p> <p>1. His favourite actor is Gene Kelly. </p> <p>2. He used to have a pet kangaroo. No, really. </p> <p>3. Improbably, for an Australian who also lived in LA for three years, he doesn't own a car. </p> <p>4. He was told off for singing too well in the football stadium sequence in Ten Things... </p> <p>5. He was a highly rated hockey player in his schooldays.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There's a 'fact' doing the rounds that claims Australia has more ballet dancers per capita than any other country. It's probably urban myth, along the lines of the Swedish suicide rate or the six degrees of separation. And what is certain is that no one in the film business believes it. When Ridley Scott was trying to think of an actor who was tough enough to play the lead in Gladiator, he considered Mel Gibson, then decided he was too old and went for Russell Crowe. Because as far as the movies are concerned, being 'Australian' is a guarantee of uninhibited masculinity. Which might just explain the otherwise unlikely choice of Perth-born Heath Ledger to play Gibson's son in the new American Revolution epic, The Patriot. 'From what I've seen, it is absolutely the most perfect time for Australians to be here,' Ledger says. Unlike the New Zealand-born Crowe or the New York State-spawned Gibson, the 21-year-old Ledger is unambiguously Australian. But like them, he looks like he could be handier in a fight than your average young Hollywoodite. In Ten Things I Hate About You, last year's teen Taming Of The Shrew reworking, Ledger's hulking build and wild hair made him seem older than most of his co-stars, even though he was actually a rare real teenager in a high-school movie. Ledger started acting at 12, and did the usual Australian TV thing, including a spot on Home And Away and a series called Sweat in which, intriguingly, he played a gay cyclist. That led to Roar, which was a short lived American made but Queensland based series with Ledger getting to show off his brawn in the role of a fifth-century Celtic warrior. Although the show is still fondly remembered by pubescent American girls, it only lasted a season. But not long after that, Ledger got the part of Patrick in Ten Things I Hate About You and the lead in Two Hands, a darkly comic thriller that was a big hit back in Australia. All in all, it seems like a pretty smooth rise. Next up he'll be taking top billing in A Knight's Tale, a medieval adventure by Payback director Brian Helgeland. But Ledger's big showcase is The Patriot, made by the Independence Day team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich and clearly aimed at the Braveheart niche in the cinema market. As the vehemently anti-British son, Ledger is the one who spurs the initially reluctant hero (Gibson) into action. 'He's incredibly quick,' Gibson says. 'I recall how shit scared he was when we first started, but we joked around, as guys do, and before long, he fitted in perfectly.' But maybe Heath Ledger isn't quite as much of a pure Aussie bloke as everyone thinks. He couldn't manage to be stoic through the eighteenth-century soldiering required for the part, refusing to hide the pain when he shred a finger firing a musket. 'I wasn't a brave soldier,' he confesses. Five things you should know about Heath Ledger: 1. His favourite actor is Gene Kelly. 2. He used to have a pet kangaroo. No, really. 3. Improbably, for an Australian who also lived in LA for three years, he doesn't own a car. 4. He was told off for singing too well in the football stadium sequence in Ten Things... 5. He was a highly rated hockey player in his schooldays.",

      "trailText": "<p>John Woo is a moralist, a romantic, and a superb director of action, which makes it all the more surprising that he's only just hitting his stride in Hollywood. Damon Wise charts his rise from Hong Kong B-movies to Mission: Impossible 2.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a filmmaker working in Hollywood today who had a tough upbringing. His father was ill, so his mother worked as a stonecutter to make ends meet. He had his first lesson in life, his first indication that things were not necessarily as they should be. So he began to wonder about a spiritual dimension, and was attracted to the Catholic Church. He even trained as a priest. The seminary, however, wouldn't accept him. </p> <p>Even though his films have violence on a scale seldom seen elsewhere, you can still see the moral lessons of the scriptures there, just waiting to be noticed, absorbed and learnt. This man, however, is not Martin Scorsese. He's not even Catholic: John Woo was raised in Hong Kong and his family was very definitely Protestant. Even so, there was something about the Catholic Church that appealed to his innate sense of decency. In his breakthrough film The Killer in 1989 he included a scene few outside his hardcore fans would recognise as a signature flourish: the routine destruction of a statue of the Virgin Mary. </p> <p>Some would see this as a yardstick of the way culture is headed, but Woo doesn't see it quite like that. 'Those scenes,' Woo said then, 'show how war can turn heaven into hell; anything that is pure and innocent is destroyed. The Virgin Mary symbolises purity, and she's shattered by bullets.' </p> <p>John Woo is a great moralist. He's also a romantic, and a superb director of action, which makes it all the more surprising he's only just hitting his stride in Hollywood with the insanely successful sequel to Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible, an action-heavy blockbuster that made leading man (and producer) Tom Cruise a multi-millionaire (again) in its opening four-day weekend. But Woo doesn't come from Hollywood, he never ran with the Movie Brats and could not conceivably be called a wunderkind. No, John Woo is a polite, well-dressed 52-year-old with a healthy disregard for the conventions of Hollywood filmmaking but a rigid respect for its moral codes. Talking about his movies of the late Eighties, he once told a interviewer: 'I was very influenced by musicals like Singin' In The Rain and West Side Story, and dancers like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. They have the rhythm of life. I shoot action scenes just as though they were dance sequences. I love ballet, I love dancing.' </p> <p>So how did this man come to orchestrate some of the most outrageous - if not explicit - violence in movies? Born in Guanghzhou, south China, in 1948, his family saved enough to send him to college in Hong Kong, where he joined a student theatre group and began making short 8mm films. After graduating, he began working in the local movie industry and in 1973 he joined the famous Golden Harvest company, for whom he began working as a director. When his first film, The Young Dragons, was released in 1973, it was already a milestone. 'I was 26 when I made it,' he said, 'and it was rare for anyone under 40 to be trusted to direct.' Golden Harvest liked what they saw, and Woo was given a three-year contract. </p> <p>Over the next 10 years, Woo became prolific, putting out an admirable 13 movies, though not all for Golden Harvest.Yet few of them figure in his biography. Who now would dwell on 1976's Princess Chang Ping, an attempt to capture on film some of the success of the Cantonese Opera. Or 1980's From Riches To Rags, a satire on consumerism that Woo himself acknowledges owes a debt to Mel Brooks, of all people. And although it's seen as a turning point by his biographers, few know of his 1986 film Heroes Shed No Tears, which caused an irreparable rift with his paymasters. 'Golden Harvest didn't like the focus on relationships or the bleakness of the ending,' said Woo. 'But I wouldn't agree to change anything, and so I abandoned it.' The film was released only after the commercial success of A Better Tomorrow, made three years later, which dealt with themes of love, loyalty and betrayal beneath its surface story of two brothers on either side of the law. It was, he said, 'the film I most wanted to make, but I was afraid that it might fail commercially. The audience is supposed to want pace, not serious issues and frightening violence and death.' </p> <p>But the film, his first collaboration with local action star Chow Yun-Fat, was a hit from its first midnight preview screenings, and Woo became something of a cult figure in the faceless world of Hong Kong cinema. Three years later, after an ill-advised sequel, he teamed up again with Fat to make the film that cemented his reputation, The Killer, in which his leading man plays an assassin, double-crossed by the mob, being pursued by a cop whose job will be on the line if he doesn't deliver. It was a classic mirror theme to which the director would return throughout his career, reflecting his concern for moral issues, identity and equilibrium outside his bravura, balletic flair for chaos and violence. </p> <p>The Killer and the following year's brutal A Bullet In The Head brought Woo to the West's attention, and 1992's Hard Boiled primed him for export. The simple story of a cop trying to bust a gun-running operation, which a plain-clothes colleague has infiltrated, Hard Boiled showed some of his most inventive work, but balanced it with a sentimental storyline that proved Woo was Hollywood material. </p> <p>The following year, Evil Dead director Sam Raimi brought him to California to bring oriental flair to an action movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. A loose remake of the 1932 movie The Most Dangerous Game, in which an insane Russian count takes pleasure in hunting humans in place of animals, the film was switched to urban New Orleans and had Van Damme as a struggling merchant sailor drawn into this ongoing snuff match by accident. </p> <p>Though it suffered poor reviews for its star and dialogue, the American press were generous to Woo's vision and even seemed to sympathise when he trimmed some three minutes of violence to appease the moralistic censor. Although not successful, the film brought Woo - and Hong Kong cinema - to a wider audience. Through Woo, cinemagoers began to understand the genealogy of Harvey Keitel's two-handed gunplay in Reservoir Dogs (a film believed to have been based on City On Fire by Woo's Hong Kong compadre Ringo Lam). They began to understand that violence could have a style, a context and a moral centre. </p> <p>Championed by the likes of Raimi and Quentin Tarantino - whose Rolling Thunder outlet distributed early Woo and other Hong Kong directors - Woo found Hollywood hard going. His next outing, Broken Arrow, starring a cast-against-type John Travolta as a fighter pilot involved in a plot to steal nuclear weaponry, fared little better. But everything crystallised with Face/Off , a hokey sci-fi thriller in which mad bomber Castor Pollux (Nic Cage) surgically switches identity to infiltrate the life of police officer Sean Archer (Travolta). Travolta's character responds by undergoing the same surgery, effectively becoming the villain. </p> <p>The result was Woo in exelsis, showing how comfortable the good guy is in the bad guy's skin but also the bad guy's winsome envy of the good guy's lifestyle. The set-piece is undoubtedly the moment in which a child wearing headphones stumbles through a scene of wanton carnage. The song playing on his Walkman is Somewhere Over The Rainbow, a last-minute substitute for Puff The Magic Dragon. The image sums up Woo's work and his impact. </p> <p>After the casual gun-slinging of the Tarantino wannabes, Woo is still determined to give his work a conscience and emotional resonance. When Tom Cruise came to him with Mission: Impossible 2, his loathing of sequels meant he nearly turned it down. 'There's nothing creative about it,' he told Entertainment Weekly. 'You have to follow the first. You have to follow the same characters.' But when Cruise offered him artistic control, Woo changed his mind, and although the finished product shows the danger of writing dialogue to accommodate pre-ordained action scenes, MI2 still bears the hallmarks of an auteur working in a genre more accustomed to seeing Steven Seagal in a singed chef's hat than Nicolas Cage suffering a crisis of conscience. It takes an age to peak, before erupting into spectacular po-faced kung fu, but MI2 still dwells on issues most other action directors ignore or sweep under the carpet. Cruise's enemy is not a convenient Cold War nemesis but an old colleague gone bad. The battlefield they fight over is a beautiful female art thief, played by Thandie Newton. </p> <p>Old traditions die hard, and even after 27 years, John Woo is inclined to put core Chinese values before the dollar sign. 'All of my movies are primarily about family, friendship, loyalty and honour.' If the box office receipts for MI2 are anything to go by, Woo might be on to something. It's just a shame Hollywood took so long to get him there. </p> <p>Mission: Impossible 2 opens on 7 July.</p>",

'This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings.' </p> <p>It has taken some time, but we are catching up. Or at least Steven Wise is. His book, Rattling the Cage, has caught fire on both sides of the Atlantic and with good reason. The book is a gem. I can count only a handful of books that changed the way I saw the world and this is one of them. It is a revolutionary work for the effect it may have, like the great Cautio Criminalis in the Middle Ages, which began the trend that made the burning of witches no longer thinkable. It is also a pleasure to read, giving intellectual and emotional satisfaction in every sentence. It has taken a while to get used to the moral implications of the 'inherent dignity of the human person,' as the convention against torture calls it. </p> <p>Professor Wise (he teaches animal law at law schools at Harvard, Chicago and Vermont) asks us to begin to think about the same concept for animals. He is not asking us to make an imaginative leap, but is taking us step by step along a simple, logical trajectory, through the history of human attitudes towards slavery, the rights of women, of children, until we see that we are resisting the basic similarities between the great apes and humans in vain. If bonobos can understand 3,000 words, we are at a loss to understand why they should not have some of the same basic legal protections that those of us who know fewer words in foreign languages have. </p> <p>Wise writes: 'Just because a chimpanzee placed before a keyboard fails to produce something worthy of Shakespeare does not indicate that he has no mind. I can't produce something worthy of Shakespeare and neither can you. If fundamental rights depend on the ability to write like Shakespeare or paint like Leonardo, almost no human beings would have them.' </p> <p>I go along with this, though I accord greater importance to Darwin's notion of sentience, where what matters is not intelligence but feeling. The similarity of feelings between humans and other animals is, to me, much less of a jump, and far more fascinating, than our so-called cognitive similarities. On both counts, it is good to remind ourselves that only five or six million years ago, humans, chimpanzees and bonobos were the same animal. And as everyone knows by now, we share more than 98 per cent of our genes with chimpanzees (in fact, chimps and gorillas are more genetically dissimilar than humans and chimps). </p> <p>Actually, genetically, we are not completely dissimilar from wolves, and socially we are very close to wolves, which is why we bond so easily and so deeply with dogs. If the human brain has somewhere between 10 billion and 100 trillion neurons, the complexity of the brain of just about any other so-called higher animal with three times less is not so different. It has taken us forever to acknowledge that other animals have conscious experiences, are aware, but the revolution is picking up speed and this book is giving it a mighty shove. </p> <p>We are forever looking for reasons not to accord dignity (rights, value, guarantees of freedom from pain, whatever it is) to other animals. 'They can't point,' we say. It is true: I find myself wondering whether one cow is able to draw attention to something interesting for a friend. But Wise examines a great deal of research showing how many of the great apes do precisely this. </p> <p>One of the great virtues of this book is to take you over ground that is both unfamiliar (the legal territory) and familiar, such as the ape-language experiments, but reviewing all with a keen intelligence. It is like having a super-smart guide on an intellectual journey, who speaks ordinary language but draws your attention to things you would never see without him. </p> <p>Professor Herbert Terrace, a psychologist, achieved fame by claiming that he could not teach an ape, Nim Chimpsky, to create a sentence. Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker agree, claiming that language in humans is innate, and unique to our species. But until I read Wise's demolition of this argument, I had no idea that 240 teachers taught Nim Chimpsky, that he was punished constantly, and that Professor Terrace advocated using a cattle prod on him. Small wonder that he was a linguistic failure. Which of us would not be under these circumstances? He was taught in a windowless, empty, sterile, 8ft by 8ft, white, concrete, cinder-block cubicle. </p> <p>After Nim was gone, Terrace returned to the classrooms and 'wondered how I and the other teachers could have spent so much time in these oppressive rooms'. All it takes is for Wise to put in a telling '!' After 'I' to make us see that Terrace was unaware of another sentient being in the room. You have to love him for that.</p> <p>The thesis is simple but inescapable (the great apes deserve legal protection), the logic is impeccable (their minds are enough like ours that it makes no sense to deny them personhood), the language is entertaining and the scholarship is daunting. He has assimilated everything in law and primate behaviour to bring us the first book about the legal rights for animals that will not just startle you but convert you.

At the age of 21, he was careless enough to lose both parents. Within a month, they succumbed to their separate cancers - his father in a hurry, his mother after months of messy, excruciating sickness. </p> <p>The dandified autonomy of Jack in The Importance of Being Earnest, born in a handbag at Victoria Station, suggests to Lady Bracknell 'a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life'. Eggers, who found himself bereft in earnest, recovered by reconstructing those decencies. Assuming the role of single parent, he set himself to raise his younger brother, Christopher, who was only eight. A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is his account of this premature initiation into adulthood. </p> <p>It comes armoured with ironic self-disqualifications, of which the most obvious is its title (dismissively abbreviated to AHWOSG on the book's running heads). Pretending to mumble an apology, Eggers defines his book as a 'kind of a memoir-y kind of thing', and proposes that if readers prefer to have it fictionalised, which would soften and make optional the remorseless facts it records they should exchange their copies for a digital manuscript on floppy disk; then they'll be interactively free to revise his text as they please. The whimsical gimmickry of the preface, in which Eggers winces at 'the unavoidability... of near-constant poignance' in his situation, serves as a self-disbelieving self-advertisement. </p> <p>Irony is a reflex of his case-hardened weariness, a style appropriate to a generation of young people who suffer from a desolating self-consciousness. Eggers and his friends, setting up a satirical magazine in San Francisco, fuss about what to wear to the office and then 'remembering not to think about what to wear, wear what we would have worn had we not been thinking about what to wear'. They want 'to be successful without being seen as successful-successful'. </p> <p>These are lives lived, as Umberto Eco remarked of postmodernism, inside inverted commas. Numbness is commended as a reaction to intolerable reality. During Eggers's childhood, a friend's father douses himself with petrol, lights a match, then incinerates himself in front of the family home; his son, Ricky, Dave's friend, goes on watching television. When Dave asks him what his dad's immolation looked like, the boy compares it to a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, when the heat which seethes from the sacred box melts the Nazis like wax. There is no difference between an actual catastrophe and Hollywood's simulations. </p> <p>At times, AHWOSG reads like a preview of a world which is not only post modern but post-human. Why bother remaining human when that state entails perpetual pain? Why not aspire to the condition of versatile, indestructible plastic? Moving from Chicago to California after the deaths of his parents, Eggers takes his brother to play in a Berkeley park which looks like 'the grounds of a laboratory for experimental people-making', exhibiting every available ethnic and sexual combination as if in an advertising display for Benetton. Some advertising executive in the sky, rounding up Latinos and lesbians and mixing races for aesthetic effect, seems to have commanded: 'Get me the Nineties. Get me the future!' </p> <p>Nevertheless, AHWOSG should not be mistaken for a chronicle of slack, anaesthetised disenchantment. Its tale of disaster and recuperation is genuinely interactive, because the writer's plight is a version of our own. We are all orphans, 'God's tragic envoys', obliged to make our way through an inimical world, fortunate if we can cling together for support. Eggers can't ironically disavow his compassion in nursing his mother while she coughs up gobbets of her liver and cracks stoical jokes, or the burden of grown-up cares he volunteers to shoulder in assuming responsibility for his brother. </p> <p>The question young Dave asks Ricky about his torched parent recurs throughout the book. Wanting not to think about such things, he can't stop himself wondering what his mother's cancer looks like. Should he envisage it as a rotten fruit, an insects' hive or a metastasising tarantula? And what do her remains look like after cremation? Sifting through the contents of the urn, he separates the varieties of ash, identifying white flakes of bone and guessing that the residual black pebbles are her stricken organs, scorched to a crisp. </p> <p>Though he concentrates with stark literalness on the way things look, his achievement is to tell us how such moments feel. The episode with the cinders, like much of AHWOSG, is an exercise in empathy, a solemn act of commiseration which enjoins us to share our private, unexpressed griefs with Eggers. For all his shifty irony, he offers himself to us as a martyr, who suffers on our behalf and survives traumas which, if we're lucky, we will only experience vicariously. </p> <p>The values AHWOSG upholds are hearteningly traditional (which probably explains its success in America). With Christopher, Eggers is a fretful mother hen, worrying about the squalor of the apartments they rent: 'I could clean,' he ventures. Mugged by Mexicans, he recovers his faith in law and order, impersonating a policeman as he argues with his attackers: 'I am the cop, a friendly but stern cop.' </p> <p>By founding his magazine, he demonstrates the efficacy of economic self-help and celebrates the sense of community he shares with his like-minded collaborators. This is a parable about virtue rewarded with happiness, hard work rewarded with wealth, and moody, aggrieved solipsism rewarded with universal admiration. </p> <p>Reporting a healthy surplus left over from his advance, Eggers even pledges to distribute a percentile of the profits to the first 200 readers to make a claim. Whether or not you write to him requesting a cheque, you'll feel yourself to be richer after reading his book.</p>",

Irony is a reflex of his case-hardened weariness, a style appropriate to a generation of young people who suffer from a desolating self-consciousness. Eggers and his friends, setting up a satirical magazine in San Francisco, fuss about what to wear to the office and then 'remembering not to think about what to wear, wear what we would have worn had we not been thinking about what to wear'. They want 'to be successful without being seen as successful-successful'. These are lives lived, as Umberto Eco remarked of postmodernism, inside inverted commas. Numbness is commended as a reaction to intolerable reality. During Eggers's childhood, a friend's father douses himself with petrol, lights a match, then incinerates himself in front of the family home; his son, Ricky, Dave's friend, goes on watching television. When Dave asks him what his dad's immolation looked like, the boy compares it to a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, when the heat which seethes from the sacred box melts the Nazis like wax. There is no difference between an actual catastrophe and Hollywood's simulations. At times, AHWOSG reads like a preview of a world which is not only post modern but post-human. Why bother remaining human when that state entails perpetual pain? Why not aspire to the condition of versatile, indestructible plastic? Moving from Chicago to California after the deaths of his parents, Eggers takes his brother to play in a Berkeley park which looks like 'the grounds of a laboratory for experimental people-making', exhibiting every available ethnic and sexual combination as if in an advertising display for Benetton. Some advertising executive in the sky, rounding up Latinos and lesbians and mixing races for aesthetic effect, seems to have commanded: 'Get me the Nineties. Get me the future!' Nevertheless, AHWOSG should not be mistaken for a chronicle of slack, anaesthetised disenchantment. Its tale of disaster and recuperation is genuinely interactive, because the writer's plight is a version of our own. We are all orphans, 'God's tragic envoys', obliged to make our way through an inimical world, fortunate if we can cling together for support. Eggers can't ironically disavow his compassion in nursing his mother while she coughs up gobbets of her liver and cracks stoical jokes, or the burden of grown-up cares he volunteers to shoulder in assuming responsibility for his brother. The question young Dave asks Ricky about his torched parent recurs throughout the book. Wanting not to think about such things, he can't stop himself wondering what his mother's cancer looks like. Should he envisage it as a rotten fruit, an insects' hive or a metastasising tarantula? And what do her remains look like after cremation? Sifting through the contents of the urn, he separates the varieties of ash, identifying white flakes of bone and guessing that the residual black pebbles are her stricken organs, scorched to a crisp. Though he concentrates with stark literalness on the way things look, his achievement is to tell us how such moments feel. The episode with the cinders, like much of AHWOSG, is an exercise in empathy, a solemn act of commiseration which enjoins us to share our private, unexpressed griefs with Eggers. For all his shifty irony, he offers himself to us as a martyr, who suffers on our behalf and survives traumas which, if we're lucky, we will only experience vicariously. The values AHWOSG upholds are hearteningly traditional (which probably explains its success in America). With Christopher, Eggers is a fretful mother hen, worrying about the squalor of the apartments they rent: 'I could clean,' he ventures. Mugged by Mexicans, he recovers his faith in law and order, impersonating a policeman as he argues with his attackers: 'I am the cop, a friendly but stern cop.' By founding his magazine, he demonstrates the efficacy of economic self-help and celebrates the sense of community he shares with his like-minded collaborators. This is a parable about virtue rewarded with happiness, hard work rewarded with wealth, and moody, aggrieved solipsism rewarded with universal admiration. Reporting a healthy surplus left over from his advance, Eggers even pledges to distribute a percentile of the profits to the first 200 readers to make a claim. Whether or not you write to him requesting a cheque, you'll feel yourself to be richer after reading his book.",

      "body": "<p>When Paul Morley was a very young man, just beyond his teens, his father killed himself. Leaving the family home in Stockport, he drove all the way to Gloucestershire, and two days later, overlooking a green English landscape, he threaded a hose pipe in through the window and lay back to die. To leave a life that had become intolerable. </p> <p>When Paul Morley was told about it, he remembers that a neighbour - to give him some activity - ordered him to clean out the cooker. He mindlessly scrubbed and scrubbed the grease-encrusted interior of the oven until patches glistened silver again through the crud. Then he kind of put his father's death away. It was, he says to me, 'as if as soon as he had died, he had been dead 20 years'. For his father had been going for a long time before he was really gone, dwindling away from his own life. </p> <p>In the book that Paul Morley has written two decades later about and for him, the father is an absence to the son, who doesn't really know what he does for a living, who can't really say what he looked like. He even seems to lack a name. The book is called Nothing . It is exhilarated with words and their many meanings, hooked on repetition and pun and nuance - yet it circles round and round the 'nothing' of Paul's father, as if he really were the black hole that one of Paul's sisters calls him, sucking in emotions. He never seemed to speak, never told his son he loved him, never kissed him at the end of the day but just muttered an abbreviated 'n'night', didn't laugh. </p> <p>When he died, Paul Morley didn't see his body. A few years later, he saw another body, of the singer Ian Curtis of Joy Division. He stared and stared at it, but still didn't think of his father, who seemed to have slipped out of his life, leaving no trace behind him, like a ghost. For his son, the father was mute, colourless and invisible. He was a depressive and he died at the age his son has now reached, more or less. </p> <p>He stares across the coffee cups on the table. Paul Morley - the rock journalist who sprinkles Barthes and Sartre through his prose, co-founder of the group Art of Noise, promoter of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, master of intellectual swagger and narcissistic cool - is not the way I had expected him to be. He is 43 now, but beneath his dark stubble, his face is rather sweet and anxious. His dark eyes look young and vaguely troubled. </p> <p>And the book - though dense with the allusive, braggardly, language-intoxicated prose that Morley has made his trademark over the years, crammed with Kafka and Kierkegaard and Foucault and echoes of Italo Calvino and swoony, doomy rock stars of the Seventies such as Nick Drake and postmodern games and lists of the books he's read and the ones he's nearly written and the titles he's flirted with - is a surprise. Under the decorated and swanky surface, it is raw and self-exposing; here's a Morley who's been hiding behind himself all these years. It's about loss, grief, a shadowy bereavement that has haunted him all his adult life. It's about the father he never knew and now tries to recreate out of the 'top 10 memories' which, he says, he carries around 'like a few stones in my pocket'. </p> <p>And it's about him, an awkward and solitary boy, growing up in Stockport, miserable at school, living in a house where love could not flourish in the presence of his father's despair, disconnected from himself, drifting slackly through teenage years with greasy hair and spotty cheeks, masturbating and falling in love with Marc Bolan's songs, waiting for the first kiss that would turn him from toad to prince. He doesn't really call himself unhappy: 'Or maybe I was unhappy without knowing it. Certainly, I was extremely unhappy at school. A lot of the time, I was scared. I was scared of my dad, of what he might do next. I remember looking at him, but hoping he wouldn't see me looking at him. I do have a few memories of happiness; I was happy when I bought a record. That made me happy.' </p> <p>Music, and writing about music, was where he lost and found himself and his book remains obsessed with the sense that words are both a place to discover things and a place to hide; both treacherous and true. The father he creates is made up by him, self-consciously his fiction. </p> <p>Very soon after his father died, Paul Morley left home. 'I fled. I became someone else. I disappeared from my old life. I disappeared into the New Musical Express and all the pop culture which I found mesmerising at the time. Maybe the reason I wrote the way I did was that I was always looking for clues and meanings, but I wasn't aware of it at the time. I would write 4-5,000 words every week. I felt I was invisible, too, like my dad. I felt I kind of flamed through life and no one really noticed me. I became addicted to my byline, even more than lots of journalists do. If my name was there, that was instant reality. I must exist.' </p> <p>So he didn't think about his father at all. He went through his twenties, became famous, infamous, developed a reputation for a kind of journalistic cruelty (this seems to hurt him). Rock idols died young. But his father wasn't there, not even as a memory, a distant ache. He married, had a daughter, divorced. He started Art of Noise. His two younger sisters grew up, with some difficulty and pain (the youngest, Carol Morley, has just made a film about her promiscuous and boozy adolescent teens, The Alcohol Years), but the siblings never discussed their father's death. His mother emerged as someone loving, soft and eccentric ('almost hippyish'), but neither did she talk to her son about what had happened. </p> <p>There was no guilt, rejection, anger, not even any conscious sense of loss. He was gone, nothing. He had died miles from home, in an unknown place. There was no grave to visit. Paul Morley couldn't even remember the date of his death, not the day, or month, or even year. He thought that he had died at the age of 43 and this made him ner vous; 43 was approaching, it would hit in 2000. Perhaps, he thought, there would be 'a switch'. Perhaps he would turn into his father. When he came to write Nothing , he discovered his father actually died at 41, and he'd already passed the marker, appropriate in a book that's full of botched revelations. </p> <p>He always wanted to write a book but never had a subject (of course, he always had a subject; for the whole of his adult life this has been his hidden subject). Then an editor, hearing from a friend of a friend that his father had been a suicide, took him to the Savoy for tea and asked him to write an article about it. </p> <p>'I started, but I couldn't do it. Not in a piece like that. But I had a beginning. I put it in a shoe box. I kept thinking about doing it, and gradually I knew it was my subject. But I still felt I couldn't deal with it. I didn't think I could remember anything. There were only these little whirlpools of memory around darkness.' </p> <p>But at about the same time his daughter, who was born in 1992, started to ask questions about her dead grandfather - where is he, who was he, what happened? 'I couldn't answer and that was wrong. I realised I would have to do something. She was asking these inno cent questions and I could almost start him again from scratch for her. He could be reborn.' He pauses to sip cooling coffee. I ask if he wrote his book to find his father or maybe to love his father, who he never loved in life. 'I wanted,' he says, 'to miss him. I wanted him to be someone that I missed. I never could say, in all those years ,\"I miss my dad\". It seemed a terrible thing he'd died so far away and was in an unmarked grave. Agonising, really. Agonising for me, but agonising for him most of all, wherever he is now, with his feelings. Maybe there are still his feelings somewhere. I hope so.' </p> <p>So he wrote Nothing, and it was in the writing that he began to recover the father he never had. Most people gradually diminish after death, smaller and smaller figures on the horizon. The opposite happens for Paul Morley, whose father, having been reduced to an invisible point, gradually becomes larger for him. </p> <p>'It was an act of recovery. I had a few hard and fast facts - classic memories and voids around then. And as I wrote, I found other things, here and there. It's taken a long time to get them. I do worry, yes, that it is an exposing kind of book. I talk to my partner, and she's my best friend, too. But I don't talk to friends. I don't really have a buddy group like that. I've always been quite solitary. Maybe that's to do with Dad. And here I am, writing this book.' </p> <p>At the end of Nothing he invites his two sisters and his mother to speak their (contradictory) memories into a recorder. This is the first time the family has sat down together to speak about the past; to make a book, they can remember things that are too painful recalled in the raw. 'And for them, I think the book is good. For my mother, I think she is glad that I have made him exist again, in a way. That I've made him real for me. There are private things I have gone into that are difficult, of course. But she knew I had lost my father and she is pleased I have got him back, that he exists. There is somebody now. When we talked together, we found things about each other that we had never known. If there's only an audience of three for this book, that's a good audience.' </p> <p>He used not to feel very lovable. 'I struggled to find out what love was. Maybe I didn't have a good model in place. I was always making my decisions based on \"love\" but I think really I was looking for stability and security and felt I could contrive it. Maybe love is finding meaning in a cold universe; a father is supposed to protect a child from the cold universe, isn't he? Maybe in my twenties and thirties I was trying to find that. For a bit, pop music was my meaning.' </p> <p>Perhaps, he says, he is finally growing up now (in 'a tentative kind of way'). 'It's taken a long time,' he says ruefully, 'and maybe that's to do with my past, or maybe it's a generational thing, the pop culture we grew up with. Our generation pioneered that postponement of growing up. Maybe that's why suddenly you get the Nick Hornbys and the Tony Parsons and that lot writing about the family. About bloody dads and bloody children. We've finally realised it's not the Velvet Underground or the Sex Pistols who are extraordinary after all. It's the family.' He hasn't cried for his father yet, although he cries at almost everything else ('pathetic, hopeless'),so maybe that's the same thing. </p> <p>At the end of Nothing , Paul Morley drives out to the place where his father took his life. He stares out across the green land. He finds the grave, has the plaque reinstated. It reads: 'At Peace'. He, at last, gives his father his name. Leslie Ronald Morley. Paul Morley's dad. </p> <p>\u0095 To order Nothing (Faber, normally \u00a311.99) at the special price of \u00a39.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",

In 40 years, Carole Jahme argues, 'it has become the only scientific subject to bleed into popular culture and leave a permanent mark of gender that in turn has gone on to colour the science'. </p> <p>About 62 per cent of the World Directory of Primatologists' members are female. The feminisation of the study is just one area covered in this book, which grew out of a television programme Jahme made about women and primates. </p> <p>A major theme is the way women who study primates become hooked on the animals they befriend.

In 40 years, Carole Jahme argues, 'it has become the only scientific subject to bleed into popular culture and leave a permanent mark of gender that in turn has gone on to colour the science'. About 62 per cent of the World Directory of Primatologists' members are female. The feminisation of the study is just one area covered in this book, which grew out of a television programme Jahme made about women and primates. A major theme is the way women who study primates become hooked on the animals they befriend. Consider Janis Carter who, as a young American researcher, bonded with Lucy, a chimp taught to use sign language. Carter flew her to West Africa to 'free' the captive-born ape, who was destined for a research lab, and spent 10 years in Gambia with a chimp colony.

But then why not call him Frank Slack instead - or plain old Mr Hopeless? </p> <p>Still, never mind. It's a brilliantly funny book. And the 29 bit is easier. That's Frank's age - you know, almost hitting the big three-O (well big if you're 29), suggesting that our man is riding an age crisis, perhaps on the cusp of change. </p> <p>But, better still, 29 is also Frank's 'score' as someone you might conceivably not want to meet at a dinner party - 29 as a measure of personal success in a scale of 10 categories offering a possible total of 100. One of Frank's pet obsessions is working out how much more of a failed person he is than practically everyone else he knows in terms of wealth, health, car, sex-life, job, popularity etc. </p> <p>And this 'scoring' thing is how he does it. Everyone who passes through his mind gets stamped with a score - footballers, binmen, Rupert Murdoch. Frank calls it 'The Maths', which strikes me as quite a good name for a novel. Anyway, hence Stretch, 29, arch underachiever de nos jours. </p> <p>Frank's own highest individual score (6) is for how interesting he thinks he is. Because despite having zero money (2), a crap job as a waiter (3), an X-reg Vauxhall Cavalier (2) and virtually no sex life (1), he is quite intriguing. </p> <p>First, you might ask how on earth the maladjusted, northern, working-class Stretch finds the energy to get himself to Oxford and pass all his exams only subsequently to devote what should be his career-building years to serving mobs of shouty estate agents and slappers in some low-rent bar 'n' grill in Battersea. </p> <p>Why do Frank's old chums from college - now corporate lawyers and bond traders with Maths in the high seventies - keep in touch, make allowances for his mood swings and wayward manners, play Mum, arrange job interviews with a view to Frank's socio-cultural rehab? Why do they insist on inviting him to their parties where he is likely to get reeling drunk, start a fist fight, insult the hostess, throw up, etc. How do you solve a problem like Frank? Why would you want to - eight years on? </p> <p>And yet they do - even though they seem to represent all that Frank hates. While everyone else seems to have risen without much effort to a comfortable level of metropolitan repose, Frank is still temperamentally stranded in a smart-arse, ironic, cynical, student time warp, sneering at ambition, railing at the tokens of commercial success like someone who doesn't know the war has ended. Hey Frank, snap out of it, you feel like shouting, you're nearly 30! </p> <p>With someone like this, you know things are going to get worse before they can get better, though it's noticeable that when Frank starts drifting from his moorings so does the plot slightly. There is a protracted car journey which can't quite be sustained by extra helpings of 'The Maths' and Frank's other pastime of writing his own amusing obituaries (entrepreneur, patron of the arts, movie director etc); and a subsequent redemptive exile in the North in which Frank gets soppy about children seems, well... over-stretched. But these are quibbles in an otherwise dazzling performance.</p> <p>It's a mark of Damian Lanigan's careful handling that we can manage to love poor Frank and feel sorry for his poor rich friends at the same time. Unusually for a comic novel, there are no eccentrics competing for our attention, no egregious coincidences, no extraneous doses of good luck, no hopeful punchlines in the mouths of halfwits. </p> <p>This is a book of great poise, teeming with invention, wicked humour and unforced insights ('She had the kind of face that women call beautiful and men call \"all right I suppose\" '). </p> <p>Lanigan has a good ear for the busy, first-person vernacular that has become de rigueur in this new sub-genre of 'diary of a hopeless inadequate', but you can bet he can write in all the other languages too.

There is a protracted car journey which can't quite be sustained by extra helpings of 'The Maths' and Frank's other pastime of writing his own amusing obituaries (entrepreneur, patron of the arts, movie director etc); and a subsequent redemptive exile in the North in which Frank gets soppy about children seems, well... over-stretched. But these are quibbles in an otherwise dazzling performance. It's a mark of Damian Lanigan's careful handling that we can manage to love poor Frank and feel sorry for his poor rich friends at the same time. Unusually for a comic novel, there are no eccentrics competing for our attention, no egregious coincidences, no extraneous doses of good luck, no hopeful punchlines in the mouths of halfwits. This is a book of great poise, teeming with invention, wicked humour and unforced insights ('She had the kind of face that women call beautiful and men call \"all right I suppose\" '). Lanigan has a good ear for the busy, first-person vernacular that has become de rigueur in this new sub-genre of 'diary of a hopeless inadequate', but you can bet he can write in all the other languages too. Smart guy, 99.",

'Four dollars 40, sir,' the hapless interruptee repeats, shaking his head, hoping he is not imminently to be trapped inside his own skull narrating myriad anxieties and memories for the next four pages, hoping, that is, that the plot will skate quickly over him, except there is not exactly a plot, it must be confessed, only dozens of characters plucked from the past 100 years of US history, speaking a rather stagy, not entirely goddamn convincing Americanese, musing on their terrible, unremittingly terrible lives. </p> <p>Such torrents of self-examination could be an attempt to stage the mighty solipsistic mania of modern America: the psychic flotsam of the chatshow, the live TV family reunion, the prurient desire for exposure, for no-holds-barred, real-life confession. Poolman seems principally disappointed with the lassitude of this America, the slouching failure of its inhabitants to move beyond inert self-absorption. The problem with portraying inertia is not to fall into it, and Poolman veers between crafting and recrafting endless moments of abject paralysis, and jolting the reader out of sophoria by a wild array of semi-developed, symbolic undercurrents and frenzied surrealism. </p> <p>What plot there is revolves - in the past - around the widow of General Custer, fighting to safeguard her husband's reputation, and - in the present - around a hapless old man, Eddie Reno, who may or may not be a reincarnation of Custer's horse. Reno thinks he has freed himself from slave-wagery by murdering his abusive boss, Mr Frampton, but then finds Frampton furiously pursuing him. Reno and Frampton are kidnapped by a Native American, who seems to be related to Little Bighorn, and history repeats itself, eternal return, says Poolman, only each time the circuit comes round again the protagonists are more lacklustre and pathetic. </p> <p>Poolman goads his inert characters with a bedlam of weirdness - an army of doll-like midget prostitutes, men thought dead leering from car windows, fast-talking mystics bringing revelations of metempsychosis. This makes the book at times an effective dismantling of the stolid blandness of diners and blueberry pancakes, invading them with reincarnated lunatics and gun-toting maniacs. </p> <p>Yet, the reader ends by feeling bombarded with a bemusing array of sameness - almost indistinguishable past and present, almost indistinguishable characters. In the closing stages, one of the many mysterious speakers, talking of a father apparently 'drawn to his death by a clever little fantasy', asks the reader to decide 'Which little fantasy?' and seems surprised by our bemused silence: 'Jesus. You mean you haven't guessed it?' The novel's last words reiterate the point: 'You mean you can't guess it? Christ. You people. You're all dumber than I thought.' </p> <p>In the end, this sort of scornful wryness seems an attempt to suggest a single point running serenely under the wild, riotous bedlam of semi-meaning, semi-symbol, the unmanageable interchangeability of the characters. Either the novel would have led us to some apotheotic realisation had we been sufficiently sophisticated to discern it, or everything is non-meaning anyway, hence the wild meaningless of the novel, which is then merely a faithful reflection of things as they stand. </p> <p>The scornful challenge - 'Think you understand?

All of them, as Rupert Christiansen says of the artist G\u00e9ricault, hoped to access 'a free market, a large audience, and lots and lots of money'. They variously flee debt, depression and isolation, hoping to make it in boom-time Victorian Britain. They frequently encounter indifference, but rarely hostility, and their reception, fraught with unease and misunderstanding, makes for attractive narratives of cultural confidence.

And unmistakably Yorkshire. </p> <p>'The West Indies? I'll tell you that my first tour there did for me and cost me a place on the next two England tours,' he said, as he relaxed at his home on the outskirts of Skipton. </p> <p>'It was 1953-54 and I was only 22. They didn't like my conduct, apparently. We'd been told not to fraternise with the Windies players but lads like Gary Sobers, Lance Gibbs and Everton Weekes were mates and they became lifelong friends. I was only young and if my conduct was found wanting then it was nothing compared to that of some of the so-called senior players on that tour. I got no help from most of them. </p> <p>'I was supposed to call them \"mister\" or \"sir'\"and they just called me \"Trueman\"! I told them straight that my parents had thought long and hard about my first name. All that amateur-professional nonsense was disgraceful. </p> <p>'As for an official word on what I was supposed to have done, I don't know. I was never told.' </p> <p>Trueman played in the first, fourth and fifth Tests and helped square the series after England had been 2-0 down, but he was then largely snubbed and it was not until 1957 - when the West Indies toured England - that Trueman was apparently forgiven and handed a genuine chance. He grabbed it with both hands and finished the series with 22 wickets as England triumphed 3-0 against a side packed with names such as Sobers, Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes and Sonny Ramadhin. </p> <p>'That West Indies series got me established in the England team at last,' he says. 'I was in the side pretty much all the way through for the next eight years until I finished as a Test bowler in 1965.' </p> <p>Thoughts of the Sixties inevitably drift to the 1964 series against Australia when everyone who lived through those summers recalls Trueman smashing through the 300-wicket barrier against the Aussies. </p> <p>Yet it was against the West Indies - that side again - that Trueman undoubtedly hit his international peak a year earlier in 1963. England lost the series 3-1 but Trueman was on fire and bagged his best- ever series haul of 34 wickets. </p> <p>It was a controversial tour with the West Indies twin pace attack of Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith under scrutiny. Hall, tall, lean and athletic, was the genuine article, but Griffith - a bowler Trueman had encountered during the 1959-60 tour to the Caribbean - astounded him. </p> <p>'I remembered him as a medium pacer,' he recalls. 'Then in 1963, when they played Yorkshire, I saw his run-up had lengthened by about 15 yards and his pace was absolutely electrifying. But from the moment I saw him I believed he was throwing the ball. Not just his fast delivery - they were all fast anyway - but all of them. </p> <p>'He hit Doug Padgett and Jackie Hampshire and Jackie still feels the effects of it. Ken Barrington got very upset by Griffith. It wasn't that we suspected Charlie of chucking_ we knew. His pace was amazing and he had hardly any follow-through. He and Hall hit Brian Close so many times in the Lord's Test we called Closey \"leopard\" because the bruises looked like spots.' </p> <p>For all that, Griffith helped the West Indies to a series win and he was only ever 'called' for throwing twice - once against India in 1962 and by English umpire Arthur Fagg when the Windies played Lancashire in 1966. </p> <p>As Trueman recalls, it was not the only time 'throwing' became an issue in matches between the sides. </p> <p>'On my first tour in 1954, Tony Lock was no-balled for throwing by Clyde Walcott's uncle who was standing as umpire. It upset Tony very, very much. Tony went away after that and worked hard on it and he got back into the England side. There was talk at that time about Sonny Ramadhin's action but he wore his sleeves down and you couldn't really see if the arm was straight or bent. </p> <p>'Years later Sonny did an interview with cricket writer Peter Johnson and admitted he'd thrown it throughout his career.' </p> <p>But back to the Hall-Griffith series of 1963 and Trueman has a remarkable story to tell about the second Test at Lord's. He was relaxing in the bath when he heard Dick Robins, the chairman of selectors, addressing the match umpires, Syd Buller and Eddie Phillipson. </p> <p>He was telling the umpires not - repeat not - to no-ball Charlie Griffith. I could not believe what I was hearing. Some time later I recounted his story in my autobiography and a small piece appeared in the Daily Telegraph rubbishing my claim. To which I reply_ who was there in the bathroom to say I am a liar? Some can call it diplomacy and not wishing to offend; I call it a cover-up. And cricket is still covering up to this day. We see it now with the betting scandals and the only surprise is that the stories about South Africa were uncovered and put into the public domain in the first place.' </p> <p>Trueman caused a stir a few years ago by raising questions about Courtney Walsh's action in delivering his quicker ball. He has no regrets but is not surprised that no action was taken. </p> <p>'That's cricket,' he says. 'Courtney is a lovely guy and a fine bowler but I was concerned about his quicker ball. I know one leading umpire considered reporting him but he was told from the highest level: \"don't think about it\". </p> <p>'I've also expressed my concern about one of our own. Darren Gough's quicker ball can look a little suspect but when I mentioned this to a leading selector at the time I was told quite plainly: \"If so-and-so has got away with it for years, why should we worry about Darren?\" ' </p> <p>Is it, I volunteered, a sensitive issue... a race issue? When Muttiah Muralitharan's action was 'called' in Australia, it was suggested there was a racist motive. </p> <p>For once, Freddie was almost speechless. 'Ah,' he said at last. 'But if you get me on that subject then any loose talk from me would take us all the way back to 1954 and the reasons I was dropped after my first West Indies tour. And that would not do at all, would it?' </p>",

Thoughts of the Sixties inevitably drift to the 1964 series against Australia when everyone who lived through those summers recalls Trueman smashing through the 300-wicket barrier against the Aussies. Yet it was against the West Indies - that side again - that Trueman undoubtedly hit his international peak a year earlier in 1963. England lost the series 3-1 but Trueman was on fire and bagged his best- ever series haul of 34 wickets. It was a controversial tour with the West Indies twin pace attack of Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith under scrutiny. Hall, tall, lean and athletic, was the genuine article, but Griffith - a bowler Trueman had encountered during the 1959-60 tour to the Caribbean - astounded him. 'I remembered him as a medium pacer,' he recalls. 'Then in 1963, when they played Yorkshire, I saw his run-up had lengthened by about 15 yards and his pace was absolutely electrifying. But from the moment I saw him I believed he was throwing the ball. Not just his fast delivery - they were all fast anyway - but all of them. 'He hit Doug Padgett and Jackie Hampshire and Jackie still feels the effects of it. Ken Barrington got very upset by Griffith. It wasn't that we suspected Charlie of chucking_ we knew. His pace was amazing and he had hardly any follow-through. He and Hall hit Brian Close so many times in the Lord's Test we called Closey \"leopard\" because the bruises looked like spots.' For all that, Griffith helped the West Indies to a series win and he was only ever 'called' for throwing twice - once against India in 1962 and by English umpire Arthur Fagg when the Windies played Lancashire in 1966. As Trueman recalls, it was not the only time 'throwing' became an issue in matches between the sides. 'On my first tour in 1954, Tony Lock was no-balled for throwing by Clyde Walcott's uncle who was standing as umpire. It upset Tony very, very much. Tony went away after that and worked hard on it and he got back into the England side. There was talk at that time about Sonny Ramadhin's action but he wore his sleeves down and you couldn't really see if the arm was straight or bent. 'Years later Sonny did an interview with cricket writer Peter Johnson and admitted he'd thrown it throughout his career.' But back to the Hall-Griffith series of 1963 and Trueman has a remarkable story to tell about the second Test at Lord's. He was relaxing in the bath when he heard Dick Robins, the chairman of selectors, addressing the match umpires, Syd Buller and Eddie Phillipson. He was telling the umpires not - repeat not - to no-ball Charlie Griffith. I could not believe what I was hearing. Some time later I recounted his story in my autobiography and a small piece appeared in the Daily Telegraph rubbishing my claim. To which I reply_ who was there in the bathroom to say I am a liar? Some can call it diplomacy and not wishing to offend; I call it a cover-up. And cricket is still covering up to this day. We see it now with the betting scandals and the only surprise is that the stories about South Africa were uncovered and put into the public domain in the first place.' Trueman caused a stir a few years ago by raising questions about Courtney Walsh's action in delivering his quicker ball. He has no regrets but is not surprised that no action was taken. 'That's cricket,' he says. 'Courtney is a lovely guy and a fine bowler but I was concerned about his quicker ball. I know one leading umpire considered reporting him but he was told from the highest level: \"don't think about it\". 'I've also expressed my concern about one of our own. Darren Gough's quicker ball can look a little suspect but when I mentioned this to a leading selector at the time I was told quite plainly: \"If so-and-so has got away with it for years, why should we worry about Darren?\" ' Is it, I volunteered, a sensitive issue... a race issue? When Muttiah Muralitharan's action was 'called' in Australia, it was suggested there was a racist motive. For once, Freddie was almost speechless. 'Ah,' he said at last. 'But if you get me on that subject then any loose talk from me would take us all the way back to 1954 and the reasons I was dropped after my first West Indies tour. And that would not do at all, would it?'",

The idle rich with time to pass a full eight hours comatose were consigned to the wheelie bin of history. For the past two decades, time to spare has become the burden of the poor and not enough time to sleep a status symbol. 'Busy' is now the standard reply to the social inquiry 'How are you?', intended to indicate that the speaker, in the argot of the day, has a life. But a change is in the air. Really Important Execs not only expect to 'knit up the ravelled sleave of care', they see a potential exclusivity in the offing: the men and women managing their lives so well that they even have time for eight hours' sleep. We look forward to a future where the well-rested discuss their dreams over a pre-siesta lunch. This is an area where Britain could surely set the pace (slow). Still there? Go back to bed.",

      "body": "<p>Here is how bad things have become in Italy: in the town of Camorosso, north of Trieste, children have been prohibited from playing football in the street. Residents complained that the noise of the games, played late into midsummer evenings, distracted them while they were watching television. </p> <p>The town council responded with a by-law that makes playing football on any public street or square an offence punishable by a \u00a315 fine and confiscation of the ball. But let's not be too quick to judge these good burghers harshly: it is probable that their real motivation is to discourage their young ones from embarking on a life of crime. </p> <p>If it is true that every Italian football season is composed of equal parts, scandal, hype, and genuine magnificence, this was the one in which Serie A found the third in such short supply that it tried to compensate by doubling up on the first, leaving even the most credulous of tifosi gagging and the always malleable sporting press calling it 'The Poisoned Season.' </p> <p>'Remember,' an Italian player said to me three years ago, as I was nearing the end of my season-long stay with the Serie B team of Castel di Sangro, 'we are the land not only of Dante, but Machiavelli.' True enough, but Machiavelli at least preached efficiency. </p> <p>One would have to go back to the bestial Borgias of the Fifteenth Century to find ancestry for this year's calamities, which occurred in three main areas: on the field, in the stands and under the table. </p> <p>On the field, the picture was starkly etched: for the second successive season, Italian clubs, who had won or reached the finals of the Uefa Cup in all but one other year of the decade, failed to get past the last 16. And only Lazio squeezed through the quarter-finals of the Champions League only to be immediately routed by Valencia. </p> <p>As for the national team, who qualified for Euro 2000 with only a one-point margin over Denmark and Switzerland, their season-long diversion seemed to determine against which unheralded opponents they could play worst in a friendly: the home losses to Belgium and Denmark ran neck and neck for top honours, though last week's defeat in Norway was pretty poor, too. </p> <p>The cause of the collapse was excruciatingly apparent to anyone who forced himself (as I did, for reasons that are unclear even to my therapist) to watch attentively from September to May. </p> <p>For this was the year when the obsession with defence, of which the Italians have never quite rid themselves grew like some horrid mutant fungus, choking off the oxygen supply on which the poetry of the game depends for its survival. </p> <p>Even in midfield and on what passed for attack it was the monotonous chant of 'legs and lungs, legs and lungs' that drowned out all else, to the point where anyone who displayed even a trace of creative impulse was certain to be benched. </p> <p>Consider the fate of the magnificent Roberto Baggio, who at 32 but with his skills refined rather than diminished, found himself suddenly chained to the bench by Marcello Lippi at Inter Milan. Baggio is, and always has been, a magician, his almost preternatural vision supported by an astonishing array of ballistic acrobatics that produce positively hallucinogenic effects, not to mention, goals, assists and victories. </p> <p>Less apparent to the oblivious, among whom Lippi shamefully numbered himself, is that Baggio possesses also as hard and fast and relentless a will to win as any man who has ever played the game. Lippi, however, was enamoured of the vision of a phalanx of muscular automatons: robotic football, designed for our Brave New World. </p> <p>Not only did he mistrust the sublime, he couldn't even recognise it as it happened. This caused him to cast an openly spiteful eye on Baggio, whose football begins at just that point beyond which the X's and O's of the chalkboad cannot go. </p> <p>All season long, Baggio suf fered with the silent dignity of a champion, but make no mistake: he suffered dearly. I spoke with him in early November, and even then the pain was apparent beyond the surface glimmer of the eyes, the anguish behind the brave attempts to smile. </p> <p>And that was only at the beginning of the year of large and small humiliations the sadistic Lippi made him endure in what seemed a campaign of cruelty designed to break Baggio's indomitable spirit. </p> <p>But by no means only at Inter was a sterile hyper-tacticality the new order of the day in Italy. This may have simplified the lives of the managers, who are cloned at Italy's national coaching academy and licensed to practice only after all traces of daring and imagination have been stamped out, but clearly it failed to charm the fans. </p> <p>It took no elaborate polling, only a counting of empty seats, to demonstrate that Serie A's sudden affliction with the calcio of constipation had the tifosi stampeding for the exits. </p> <p>At \u00a3100 a seat, they had come to expect football, not tic-tac-toe. Defending champions Juventus saw attendance fall by more than 10 per cent as defence and defence only reigned supreme; while at Perugia - after the sale of their one exciting player, Hidetoshi Nakata - gate revenues plunged by more than 25 per cent. </p> <p>Even the notoriously head-in-the-sand Federazione sensed something was wrong when fewer than 300 turned out to see Lazio play an Italian Cup match in Venice. While the spectacle in the stands might have been more vivid than the rigor-mortis setting in on the pitch, it was seldom edifying. There were also scandalous outbreaks of violence and racism in the domestic game. And then there was the end of season farce. </p> <p>For years, virtually everyone in Italy who is not a Juventus supporter has been convinced that the club's success has come less from merit than from intricate arrangements with an entire generation of referees. </p> <p>It is an article of faith among many that over the years Juventus have created an entire platoon of Manchurian Candidates, who can peacefully and calmly live their cover story lives, and work honestly as referees. But then one day the call comes, the conditioning kicks in, the dirty deed is done, and Juventus win yet another title. </p> <p>The man behind the puppet screen has long been presumed but never proven to be a certain Luciano Moggi, officially sixth down on the Juventus organisational chart, but widely perceived as the Agnelli family's Rasputin. </p> <p>With Juventus two points ahead of Lazio on the season's penultimate weekend, a young referee named De Santis was assigned to their crucial match against Parma. In the final seconds of the game, with Juventus 1-0 up, Parma's Cannavaro scored an impeccable header from a corner. The match was tied 1-1, and so it would end, leaving Lazio even on points with Juventus. </p> <p>But wait. De Santis waved off the goal, then spun and ran toward the opposite end of the field, blowing his whistle to end the match along the way, then disappearing immediately into the tunnel that led from the field and into his car conveniently awaiting him in the nearest possible parking lot. </p> <p>Players from both sides, dozens of commentators, hundreds of journalists, thousands of spectators and millions of television viewers around the world (including this one) were mystified. What possibly could have led to the annulling of the goal? </p> <p>Two dozen replays, freeze-frames and slow-motions from every possible angle demonstrated beyond any doubt that absolutely nothing irregular had occurred. </p> <p>It was then that the inexperienced De Santis made the blunder that will cost him his career. An enterprising journalist obtained the referee's mobile phone number and called him in his car. Instead of terminating the call instantly, the flustered young man tried tried to explain. </p> <p>He'd seen pushing in the area even before the kick had been taken and had blown his whistle in an attempt to sort it out. Therefore, he had not, in reality, annulled any goal, for there had been no goal to annul. </p> <p>Ah, but he'd failed to take television into account, and replays showed irrefutably that the ball was already bulging in the back of the Juventus net before De Santis had even begun to raise his whistle to his lips. </p> <p>Caught on audiotape now, in a lie both barefaced and pathetic, De Santis simply disappeared and has yet to resurface. Only the most dramatic of reversals could now dampen the flames of outrage threatening to destroy the whole edifice (or should that be artifice?) that had made Italy the envy of the footballing world. </p> <p>But let it never be said that either Moggi, God or Lucifer acts by the half-measure. </p> <p>The following Sunday a downpour inundated the Perugia ground at halftime. </p> <p>This was of interest only because Perugia's opponents were Juventus, who needed only a draw to secure the title, and who had seemed quite content to be 0-0 at half time. It became apparent that the Federazione was not going to permit this Poisoned Season to extend even a microsecond longer than necessary, even if it meant issuing scuba gear for the second half. Although the pitch was under water and the game held up, the referee ruled that play would continue and five minutes into the second half a lumbering Perugia defender reached into the muck in front of the Juventus goal and flipped an object - by God, it was the ball! - past the stunned Juventus keeper. </p> <p>So the game ended 1-0, which coupled with Lazio's easy home win over Reggina sent the title to Rome. </p> <p>Ten days later, having just played perhaps the finest match in what might well come to be viewed as the greatest career any Italian footballer has ever achieved, a slight and shy man named Baggio, who the day before had earned Inter qualification to next year's Champions League, scoring two goals that can only be described as brushstrokes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, parked his car in front of the house in which he'd grown up, in the small northern village of Caldogno. He knew he would would never wear Inter's shirt again. </p> <p>To ensure that his town would never be mistaken for Camorosso he removed from the trunk a brand new football and began dribbling it down the main street until joined by enough adoring children to assure the commencement of a game which, without riling the neighbours in the slightest, would last until well after midnight.</p>",

Ten days later, having just played perhaps the finest match in what might well come to be viewed as the greatest career any Italian footballer has ever achieved, a slight and shy man named Baggio, who the day before had earned Inter qualification to next year's Champions League, scoring two goals that can only be described as brushstrokes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, parked his car in front of the house in which he'd grown up, in the small northern village of Caldogno. He knew he would would never wear Inter's shirt again. To ensure that his town would never be mistaken for Camorosso he removed from the trunk a brand new football and began dribbling it down the main street until joined by enough adoring children to assure the commencement of a game which, without riling the neighbours in the slightest, would last until well after midnight.",

Up to 17,000 England fans travelling without tickets are expected to be in Eindhoven tomorrow for the team's opening game with Portugal, raising fears of violent clashes between rival thugs. The names of the men turned away were on a list of known or suspected hooligans. A Home Office spokesman said: 'That should get the message over that if you're on the list, don't travel.' Another fan who has been banned from travelling to international matches after a conviction for soccer violence was stopped by police at Harwich, Essex, as he tried to board a ferry to Holland. The fans who get through are expected to congregate in an area of Eindhoven dubbed 'Bar Street' by locals because it is packed with 80 adjacent pubs and clubs. Some bar owners were yesterday tying their chairs to the tables amid fears that trouble could erupt. As police warned potential English troublemakers that 'violence will be met with violence', an Observer investigation has established that English thugs are preparing to lead a 'united front' of racist troublemakers from across Europe to target Turkish people and businesses. Security forces in the Netherlands and Belgium fear hooligans from several countries will join forces to attack Turkish targets in a bid to avenge the recent murders of two Leeds United fans in Istanbul. The March killing in Istanbul, followed by fresh Anglo-Turkish battles in Copenhagen last month, have produced a lethal rivalry. 'What everybody dreads is a repetition of what happened in Istanbul: that somebody gets killed in violence involving English supporters and Turkish people,' said Els Cleemput of the gendarmerie, Belgium's national police force. 'We are worried about Turkish people being targeted. This is very much a concern for us, and all our local brigades have been informed of the threat. We will monitor English fans and try to avoid them meeting Turkish people.' Euro 2000 security chiefs admit the sizeable Turkish populations in both countries, and the dozens of predominantly Turkish areas, could make policing difficult.

Police have established that neo-Nazi Belgian hooligans have been in contact with English thugs by telephone and the internet offering to join forces.

Secondary schools will end the 9am-3.30pm routine to adapt to the changes, with many adopting the Continental system of an earlier start and finish to allow for sporting and cultural activities.</p> <p>As part of the plans, Education Secretary David Blunkett will next month officially launch the City Academies: inner-city centres of academic excellence to be jointly run and funded by private business, charities or churches and the Department for Education and Employment.</p> <p>But Graham Lane, education adviser to the Local Government Association, responded furiously last night: 'It's the most dangerous proposal to come out of this Government. This is the dismantling of comprehensive education. Private industry is working with the churches and the Government to destroy local accountability.'</p> <p>The new 'independent' state schools, established where schools have been designated as failures by inspectors, will operate outside the control of local authorities and will blur the divide between state and independent schools.</p> <p>Boots the Chemist and Reg Vardy, the north-east car dealer, are already involved in plans to set up new schools, which will be allowed to select 10 per cent of pupils.

      "bodyText": "Children will no longer attend a single secondary school from the age of 11 and the traditional school day will be scrapped, in a radical overhaul of the English school system designed to attract middle-class parents back into the state system. The planned changes, being prepared by Downing Street and a new Policy and Innovation Division within the Department for Education and Employment, will effectively consign the comprehensive system - the great egalitarian dream of the Sixties - to history. A senior DfEE adviser involved in drawing up the plans told The Observer: 'The idea that one school can provide for the needs of 1,000 inner-city children is just bonkers.' The centrepiece of the new plan will be the break-up of the traditional comprehensive, designed to teach children of all abilities under the same roof, and changes will be implemented in schools as early as September. Schools will be encouraged to specialise and children will take lessons in different institutions, receiving expert coaching in languages, music and advanced mathematics - in some cases from teachers in the private sector. Secondary schools will end the 9am-3.30pm routine to adapt to the changes, with many adopting the Continental system of an earlier start and finish to allow for sporting and cultural activities. As part of the plans, Education Secretary David Blunkett will next month officially launch the City Academies: inner-city centres of academic excellence to be jointly run and funded by private business, charities or churches and the Department for Education and Employment. But Graham Lane, education adviser to the Local Government Association, responded furiously last night: 'It's the most dangerous proposal to come out of this Government. This is the dismantling of comprehensive education. Private industry is working with the churches and the Government to destroy local accountability.' The new 'independent' state schools, established where schools have been designated as failures by inspectors, will operate outside the control of local authorities and will blur the divide between state and independent schools. Boots the Chemist and Reg Vardy, the north-east car dealer, are already involved in plans to set up new schools, which will be allowed to select 10 per cent of pupils. Critics believe it will lead to the establishment of 'a grammar school in every town' - John Major's big idea. A spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers said: 'There is no reason to attack the comprehensive system, which develops every pupil without pretending they can be put into pigeon holes early in their lives.' A manifesto pledge on secondary schools will replace the pledge on primary schools used in the 1997 election campaign. Labour will promise to raise the numbers of teachers, classroom assistants and mentors for 11-14 year-olds. Ministers are known to be concerned that standards of literacy and numeracy drop in the early years of secondary school, especially among boys. As part of the package, the DfEE will introduce a series of measures during the next academic year, including: \u0095 Special lessons for children who failed to reach the required standard in literacy and numeracy at 11. \u0095 All 11-year-olds to reach this level in the next decade - at present the target is 80 per cent by 2002. \u0095 Each child to have his or her own set of targets to reach by the age of 14. \u0095 Extension of the literacy and numeracy hour into secondary schools. \u0095 Introduction of a 'science hour' under strict guidance from Whitehall. Education Secretary David Blunkett said the reform of primary schools had led to a serious problem when children transferred at 11. 'Too many secondary schools are organised to deal with children coming from primary schools as they used to be,' he said.",

Sources within the Forensic Science Service (FSS), which manages the DNA database for the police, have told The Observer there are 'thousands' of samples illegally held. Police forces now routinely take DNA samples along with fingerprints from anybody charged with an offence. But under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, if charges are dropped or the person is acquitted, the DNA sample must be destroyed. Last month the Court of Appeal ruled that two men accused of rape and murder could not be convicted, despite 'compelling' evidence, because DNA samples held illegally by the police should have been destroyed. Sources within the FSS - who are not prepared to be named for fear of losing their jobs - said there is real concern that, unless steps are taken to 'clean up' the database, then many other prosecution cases could falter on similar grounds. Unpublished figures from the FSS, obtained by The Observer, appear to confirm that the process of removing DNA samples when a person is acquitted or no longer facing charges is not operating effectively. While there has been a dramatic rise in the number of samples being put on the database by the police, there has been a sharp fall in those being taken off. Last year the police put 174,000 DNA samples on their computer - a rise of some 20 per cent. But the number of samples coming off fell by 40 per cent to 15,000.

The alleged rapist whose case was thrown out by the Court of Appeal last month had his DNA taken when he was arrested for a burglary in January 1998. He was later acquitted and his DNA sample should have been removed from the database. He was then arrested when a DNA sample, taken from a 66-year old woman who had been raped at her home in London, matched his sample that was left on the police database. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We are carefully considering the implications of these cases in consultation with the FSS and ACPO to determine, what if any, steps need to be taken to improve the current system.' antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Concern is growing that Scotland's new national parks will be less democratic than their English equivalents and may pit new 'green lairds' against local interests across the Highlands. National parks with strict planning controls were set up in England in 1945, but moves to establish them in Scotland failed because of the power of the land-owning lobby. Increased mobility has brought vast tracts of Scotland within easy reach of the urban masses, while devolution has brought the need to control and contain pressures on the environment, particularly around Loch Lomond, the Trossachs and the Cairngorms, to the top of the political agenda. But it is feared that the bill to set up national parks, now going through the Scottish parliament, will please only 'townies with knapsacks'. The Executive is accused of rushing through legislation which is establishing general principles to cover widely varying situations. Campaigners believe that solutions designed for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs could wreak havoc in the Cairngorms and other parts of the Highlands. As the bill began its second stage in Holyrood last week, it became clear Highland campaigners are far from happy. At issue is the accountability of the park authorities.

      "body": "<p>It has been dubbed Mission Impossible. In a last-ditch effort to rescue the ailing Millennium Dome, an advertising campaign is being prepared that will acknowlege what most people have known all along: the attraction is a gigantic flop.</p> <p>Senior figures, including Dome boss Lord Falconer, are pressing for a multimillion-pound rebranding strategy with advertisements using the 'Marmite strategy': expensive television commercials that play perversely on the idea that not everyone likes the product.</p> <p>The rebranding exercise is a final attempt to get the struggling attraction back on track and make sure it hits its reduced target of 6 million visitors by the end of the year. The operators were given \u00a33m to spend on publicity as part of the \u00a329m handout from Lottery funds approved last month.</p> <p>Under the plan the New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the Dome, will dump its 'One amazing day' slogan. New commercials, being drawn up in time for the summer holidays, will admit that critics have rubbished the Dome, but argue that 85 per cent of 'real people' who visit it like it - and urge the public to go and see for themselves.</p> <p>Advertising giants Saatchi &amp; Saatchi created the initial ads for the Dome, with images of the dawn rising on a new century. But insiders now admit the campaign did not give people enough good reasons to go.</p> <p>Dome insiders concede that, with no new money to revamp the contents of the Dome, rebranding is the only option left to save the attraction. The Millennium Commission, which is being consulted on the ad campaign, wants to see more hyping of specific attractions, like the central show. It also wants more travel promotions to back up the ads.</p> <p>A source said: 'It is quite a difficult problem. They're having an enormous battle because the product is good, according to the people who have gone, but then you are coping with the unprecedented public relations negativity. I think that is a message that they want to get across to people - go and make up your own mind.'</p> <p>Despite claims that the new campaign will be a fresh start, image-makers have dismissed the rebranding as too little, too late. PR guru Max Clifford agrees that the torrent of criticism has to be confronted, but he says that the Dome should be transformed into a giant sports theme park and the new stadium turned over to the nation as soon as possible.</p> <p>Charles Wright, managing director of Wolff Olins, brand consultants, added: 'An advertising blitz will not save the Dome. The public has an impression that the product itself is flawed. If that's the case and the product is no good, then no amount of advertising will change it.</p> <p>'You only have to look at the Tate Modern or the London Eye to see what the Dome is up against. They have very clear attributes and they deliver. They have a \"Wow\" factor.'</p> <p>'When you go down to the Tate on a wet Sunday you see queues 500 yards long, with all sorts of ordinary folk joining the art lovers and tourists whom you would expect to see. The risk is that all the new advertising will be seen as window dressing. You have to say, \"Why bother?\".'</p> <p>David Rivett, managing director of international brand consultants Design Bridge, warned that the new campaign could end up doing more harm than good. 'It is sadly a doomed endeavour that could actually end up increasing the disappointment.</p> <p>'The risk with any relaunch is that you increase the hype without actually changing the product. People who are tempted to visit after seeing the new advertisements may feel let down because it promises a whole lot more but is in fact just the same old Dome.</p> <p>'If it is a choice between \"Come and see for yourself. It really is a nice day out. It's not perhaps as good as we said at first but it is a fun day for all the family\" and \"One amazing day\", I would be tempted to stick with \"One amazing day\".'</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been dubbed Mission Impossible. In a last-ditch effort to rescue the ailing Millennium Dome, an advertising campaign is being prepared that will acknowlege what most people have known all along: the attraction is a gigantic flop. Senior figures, including Dome boss Lord Falconer, are pressing for a multimillion-pound rebranding strategy with advertisements using the 'Marmite strategy': expensive television commercials that play perversely on the idea that not everyone likes the product. The rebranding exercise is a final attempt to get the struggling attraction back on track and make sure it hits its reduced target of 6 million visitors by the end of the year. The operators were given \u00a33m to spend on publicity as part of the \u00a329m handout from Lottery funds approved last month. Under the plan the New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the Dome, will dump its 'One amazing day' slogan. New commercials, being drawn up in time for the summer holidays, will admit that critics have rubbished the Dome, but argue that 85 per cent of 'real people' who visit it like it - and urge the public to go and see for themselves. Advertising giants Saatchi &amp; Saatchi created the initial ads for the Dome, with images of the dawn rising on a new century. But insiders now admit the campaign did not give people enough good reasons to go. Dome insiders concede that, with no new money to revamp the contents of the Dome, rebranding is the only option left to save the attraction. The Millennium Commission, which is being consulted on the ad campaign, wants to see more hyping of specific attractions, like the central show. It also wants more travel promotions to back up the ads. A source said: 'It is quite a difficult problem. They're having an enormous battle because the product is good, according to the people who have gone, but then you are coping with the unprecedented public relations negativity. I think that is a message that they want to get across to people - go and make up your own mind.' Despite claims that the new campaign will be a fresh start, image-makers have dismissed the rebranding as too little, too late. PR guru Max Clifford agrees that the torrent of criticism has to be confronted, but he says that the Dome should be transformed into a giant sports theme park and the new stadium turned over to the nation as soon as possible. Charles Wright, managing director of Wolff Olins, brand consultants, added: 'An advertising blitz will not save the Dome. The public has an impression that the product itself is flawed. If that's the case and the product is no good, then no amount of advertising will change it. 'You only have to look at the Tate Modern or the London Eye to see what the Dome is up against. They have very clear attributes and they deliver. They have a \"Wow\" factor.' 'When you go down to the Tate on a wet Sunday you see queues 500 yards long, with all sorts of ordinary folk joining the art lovers and tourists whom you would expect to see. The risk is that all the new advertising will be seen as window dressing. You have to say, \"Why bother?\".' David Rivett, managing director of international brand consultants Design Bridge, warned that the new campaign could end up doing more harm than good. 'It is sadly a doomed endeavour that could actually end up increasing the disappointment. 'The risk with any relaunch is that you increase the hype without actually changing the product. People who are tempted to visit after seeing the new advertisements may feel let down because it promises a whole lot more but is in fact just the same old Dome. 'If it is a choice between \"Come and see for yourself. It really is a nice day out. It's not perhaps as good as we said at first but it is a fun day for all the family\" and \"One amazing day\", I would be tempted to stick with \"One amazing day\".'",

      "body": "<p>Tim Berners-Lee, regarded as the father of the world wide web, has launched a blistering attack on government plans to give the security services sweeping powers to intercept emails and monitor traffic on the internet.</p> <p>The computer scientist who invented the technologies which underpin the web told The Observer that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill would stifle the development of the internet.</p> <p>He said the Bill - now going through the House of Lords - would have been thrown out 'in a second' in the US. 'It gives a government great power to abuse personal and commercial innovation.'</p> <p>Once the Bill becomes law every internet service provider (ISP) in the UK will be required to install a link to the security services, whichwill then be able to monitor internet traffic. Security services will be able to find out which websites users look at, which pages they download, and which chatrooms or discussion groups they frequent.</p> <p>Even more controversially, the Bill gives the Home Secretary the power to demand the surrender of keys to en-crypted data - a proposal which has been fiercely criticised by civil liberties and business organisations alike.</p> <p>Other campaigners have pointed out that the Bill does not recognise the global nature of the internet and is therefore doomed to failure.</p> <p>Berners-Lee believes the Bill fails to make governments accountable for their actions: 'There's very little protection. There's no recourse if your information has been pilfered by the Government, and even if it comes to light there is very little you can do.'</p> <p>He is also concerned that third parties will be unable to monitor the authorities' actions: 'Is there any way the press can ever find out to what extent this is happening? Is there any independent agency which has the right to follow up every request and find out statistically to what extent some of these things were just abuses of power?'</p> <p>Some commentators claim that an unregulated internet is far more dangerous than the threat of a strong-armed Government. They cite the example of David Copeland, currently being tried at the Old Bailey for causing bomb explosions in London, who allegedly found out how to make bombs on the web.</p> <p>But Berners-Lee argues that you cannot shoot the messenger.

      "bodyText": "Tim Berners-Lee, regarded as the father of the world wide web, has launched a blistering attack on government plans to give the security services sweeping powers to intercept emails and monitor traffic on the internet. The computer scientist who invented the technologies which underpin the web told The Observer that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill would stifle the development of the internet. He said the Bill - now going through the House of Lords - would have been thrown out 'in a second' in the US. 'It gives a government great power to abuse personal and commercial innovation.' Once the Bill becomes law every internet service provider (ISP) in the UK will be required to install a link to the security services, whichwill then be able to monitor internet traffic. Security services will be able to find out which websites users look at, which pages they download, and which chatrooms or discussion groups they frequent. Even more controversially, the Bill gives the Home Secretary the power to demand the surrender of keys to en-crypted data - a proposal which has been fiercely criticised by civil liberties and business organisations alike. Other campaigners have pointed out that the Bill does not recognise the global nature of the internet and is therefore doomed to failure. Berners-Lee believes the Bill fails to make governments accountable for their actions: 'There's very little protection. There's no recourse if your information has been pilfered by the Government, and even if it comes to light there is very little you can do.' He is also concerned that third parties will be unable to monitor the authorities' actions: 'Is there any way the press can ever find out to what extent this is happening? Is there any independent agency which has the right to follow up every request and find out statistically to what extent some of these things were just abuses of power?' Some commentators claim that an unregulated internet is far more dangerous than the threat of a strong-armed Government. They cite the example of David Copeland, currently being tried at the Old Bailey for causing bomb explosions in London, who allegedly found out how to make bombs on the web. But Berners-Lee argues that you cannot shoot the messenger. 'The internet is an enabling technology. Information has always been powerful and suddenly we have a much more powerful information tool, and this poses challenges to society to use it for good rather than bad.' His attack comes days after the Bill was attacked by the Institute of Directors. Professor Jim Norton, head of e-business policy, expressed fears that the Bill could be interpreted too broadly - giving government excessive powers and even forcing companies to move abroad. 'Is it really the intention to provide Inland Revenue or VAT inspectors or DTI company investigators with these powers?' he said. Many companies were worried, 'especially multinationals who contrast the proposed UK legislation with far more business-friendly proposals in Ireland, France, Germany and even the US.' The Government will come under further pressure later this week when the London School of Economics releases a research paper highly critical of the Bill. The paper - commissioned by the British Chamber of Commerce - will argue that the Bill risks inflicting serious damage to both business and civil liberties.",

Leaked to The Observer, it makes sobering reading. One in six children in the rich, industrialised nations lives in poverty. In terms of relative poverty - the number of families living on less than half median earnings - Britain finds itself in the bottom four, below Turkey, Poland and Hungary. Of the 23 countries surveyed, only Italy, the US and Mexico have a worse record on poverty.</p> <p>Nearly 20 per cent of Britain's children live in poverty, between three and four million people. That compares to 2.6 per cent in Sweden and 3.9 per cent in Norway, the two countries which could teach our stratified, wealth-obsessed country a thing or two about being a caring and equitable nation.</p> <p>Blair has made the eradication of childhood poverty one of the key planks of his Government's term of office. He says he wants to see an end to children eating beans for tea while the damp runs off the walls. He wants childhood poverty to end 'in a generation'. It is a tall order.</p> <p>The report makes much of what the Government has done in the past three years. It agrees with the claim that policies aimed at the problem - increases in child benefit, the working families tax credit, the new deal to get more poor parents into jobs - are working. To an extent. More than a million children have been lifted out of the poverty gap. But that still leaves three million too many languishing in a world of tinned rice pudding and few life chances.</p> <p>Child poverty experts, such as Jonathan Bradshaw from the University of York, say that much of the problem can be tracked back to the years of Margaret Thatcher when redistribution of wealth was a swear word, not a policy.</p> <p>The economics of trickle-down and rampant unemployment created an underclass against which Britain is still struggling. Bradshaw says that, despite progress, the problems run so deep that the country still finds itself in the position of the heartless man of Europe.</p> <p>To tackle the problem seriously will need a huge redistribution of wealth. And that needs political guts and political action, action which critics say the Government is reluctant to undertake fully, aware as it is of the important audience of Middle England. Experts estimate that it will cost another \u00a310 billion to heave Britain up to the position enjoyed by Sweden or Norway.</p> <p>'It begs the question whether there is the political support for that,' said David Piachaud, child poverty expert at the London School of Economics. 'Can you make such fundamental changes if you continue on this policy of redistribution by stealth? At some point people are going to notice it.'</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, will use this summer's spending review to announce further measures worth hundreds of millions of pounds. But as Brown gets up on Thursday evening to face the serried ranks of black-tied businessmen for his Mansion House speech, he will do so with the uncomfortable knowledge that each week, once Margaret has paid the bills - gas, electricity, telephone and water - her family has \u00a325 to live on.</p> <p>Margaret's youngest daughter 'celebrated' her fourth birthday yesterday. But Margaret won't be able to get to the shops to buy her anything as simple as a present until tomorrow's money rolls in. Her daughter's shoes are falling apart, and she sleeps on a mattress some friends had thrown out. Their house has no television or carpets.</p> <p>Last week there was food enough in the cupboard - Margaret had budgeted carefully - but the bills she has paid means she calculates that she's already spent \u00a34.14 of next week's money.</p> <p>Theresa, a mother of three from Acomb in York, remembers the moment when she felt most hopeless, about a year ago. She and her three children had just moved into a long-awaited council house. There were no carpets, and the walls were filthy. Her son, Lewis, nine at the time, was too scared to sleep in his room, the walls defaced with graffiti and stained black from a recent house fire. He clambered into his mother's bed for comfort. Theresa found it hard to soothe him: she was just as scared herself.</p> <p>Theresa's family have lived on the breadline since her husband left six years ago. In 1992 she received around \u00a380 a week with which she had to pay her bills and feed the four of them. Now, she gets \u00a393. Once the bills are paid, she has \u00a345 a week to buy food and clothes. It's taken her a long time to learn how to budget it well.</p> <p>'I'm allowed to earn an extra \u00a315 a week from cleaning. I end up spending whatever's in my purse. My daughter asked me for 20p last week. I had to say no. I hope that she understands. I hate the pettiness that poverty brings - I'm always on at the kids to turn off the bathroom light, as every penny counts. This week has been particularly bad. I'm two months behind on the sewage and water bills.'</p> <p>Two hundred miles away, in the shadow of London's Canary Wharf, a group of four tower blocks are known collectively as Will Crook Estate. On the top floor of Devitt House lives Moriom Begum. She is 44 and was born in Bangladesh. In 1991, her family of five moved into a two-bedroomed flat. Her son, 21, and daughter, 16, share one room, and the youngest, who is six, sleeps with her husband in their bed. The room was not even big enough for a cot.</p> <p>Her husband has recently become unemployed and the family claim a Jobseekers Allowance of \u00a3179 every 14 days. From this they must pay their gas, electricity and telephone bills, which leaves them with \u00a357 to spend on food for five each week. Moriom buys a big bag of rice at the beginning of the week to feed the family. Within 10 days, the money is exhausted, and four days pass during which they eat whatever is left. She can't afford to purchase clothes for her daughters costing more than \u00a35.</p> <p>Margaret in Newtown can see no way out. 'The council are trying to get me to go back to work at the moment,' she says. 'But it's impossible with the kind of childcare available. People don't seem to value family life any more.'</p>",

That compares to 2.6 per cent in Sweden and 3.9 per cent in Norway, the two countries which could teach our stratified, wealth-obsessed country a thing or two about being a caring and equitable nation. Blair has made the eradication of childhood poverty one of the key planks of his Government's term of office. He says he wants to see an end to children eating beans for tea while the damp runs off the walls. He wants childhood poverty to end 'in a generation'. It is a tall order. The report makes much of what the Government has done in the past three years. It agrees with the claim that policies aimed at the problem - increases in child benefit, the working families tax credit, the new deal to get more poor parents into jobs - are working. To an extent. More than a million children have been lifted out of the poverty gap. But that still leaves three million too many languishing in a world of tinned rice pudding and few life chances. Child poverty experts, such as Jonathan Bradshaw from the University of York, say that much of the problem can be tracked back to the years of Margaret Thatcher when redistribution of wealth was a swear word, not a policy. The economics of trickle-down and rampant unemployment created an underclass against which Britain is still struggling. Bradshaw says that, despite progress, the problems run so deep that the country still finds itself in the position of the heartless man of Europe. To tackle the problem seriously will need a huge redistribution of wealth. And that needs political guts and political action, action which critics say the Government is reluctant to undertake fully, aware as it is of the important audience of Middle England. Experts estimate that it will cost another \u00a310 billion to heave Britain up to the position enjoyed by Sweden or Norway. 'It begs the question whether there is the political support for that,' said David Piachaud, child poverty expert at the London School of Economics. 'Can you make such fundamental changes if you continue on this policy of redistribution by stealth? At some point people are going to notice it.' Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, will use this summer's spending review to announce further measures worth hundreds of millions of pounds. But as Brown gets up on Thursday evening to face the serried ranks of black-tied businessmen for his Mansion House speech, he will do so with the uncomfortable knowledge that each week, once Margaret has paid the bills - gas, electricity, telephone and water - her family has \u00a325 to live on. Margaret's youngest daughter 'celebrated' her fourth birthday yesterday. But Margaret won't be able to get to the shops to buy her anything as simple as a present until tomorrow's money rolls in. Her daughter's shoes are falling apart, and she sleeps on a mattress some friends had thrown out. Their house has no television or carpets. Last week there was food enough in the cupboard - Margaret had budgeted carefully - but the bills she has paid means she calculates that she's already spent \u00a34.14 of next week's money. Theresa, a mother of three from Acomb in York, remembers the moment when she felt most hopeless, about a year ago. She and her three children had just moved into a long-awaited council house. There were no carpets, and the walls were filthy. Her son, Lewis, nine at the time, was too scared to sleep in his room, the walls defaced with graffiti and stained black from a recent house fire. He clambered into his mother's bed for comfort. Theresa found it hard to soothe him: she was just as scared herself. Theresa's family have lived on the breadline since her husband left six years ago. In 1992 she received around \u00a380 a week with which she had to pay her bills and feed the four of them. Now, she gets \u00a393. Once the bills are paid, she has \u00a345 a week to buy food and clothes. It's taken her a long time to learn how to budget it well. 'I'm allowed to earn an extra \u00a315 a week from cleaning. I end up spending whatever's in my purse. My daughter asked me for 20p last week. I had to say no. I hope that she understands. I hate the pettiness that poverty brings - I'm always on at the kids to turn off the bathroom light, as every penny counts. This week has been particularly bad. I'm two months behind on the sewage and water bills.' Two hundred miles away, in the shadow of London's Canary Wharf, a group of four tower blocks are known collectively as Will Crook Estate. On the top floor of Devitt House lives Moriom Begum. She is 44 and was born in Bangladesh. In 1991, her family of five moved into a two-bedroomed flat. Her son, 21, and daughter, 16, share one room, and the youngest, who is six, sleeps with her husband in their bed. The room was not even big enough for a cot. Her husband has recently become unemployed and the family claim a Jobseekers Allowance of \u00a3179 every 14 days. From this they must pay their gas, electricity and telephone bills, which leaves them with \u00a357 to spend on food for five each week. Moriom buys a big bag of rice at the beginning of the week to feed the family. Within 10 days, the money is exhausted, and four days pass during which they eat whatever is left. She can't afford to purchase clothes for her daughters costing more than \u00a35. Margaret in Newtown can see no way out. 'The council are trying to get me to go back to work at the moment,' she says. 'But it's impossible with the kind of childcare available. People don't seem to value family life any more.'",

Number 81 was the home of the man Ireland nicknamed 'Maradona' (real name Derek Dunne), a one-time gifted footballer, father of two and heroin wholesaler.

Last Friday the blood had been washed down the drains and all that remained of the shooting was a cracked window covered with Dutch newspapers.

Engage, a limited-access internet site launched by the Meteorological Office last week, aims to help retailers keep their finger on the pulse of consumer demand by combining long-term weather forecasts with the most detailed research ever undertaken into shoppers' whims. The site reveals secrets such as the specific temperature at which shoppers stop swigging mineral water and start sipping tonic water (15 C) and the inexplicable taste Britons develop for lemonade around Christmas time when sales soar by more than 200 per cent. Engage, the first programme of its kind, has already won the approval of four of the five main food retailers in Britain. Safeway, which has been working with the Met Office on the system's prototype, claims it saves the company around \u00a33,000 a week at each outlet by letting store managers fine-tune stock levels, promotions and product placement. 'We've been using the trial system for just four months and already it's indispensable,' said Mark Aylwin, supply chain director at Safeway. 'It's only recently we've appreciated the huge impact that weather has on sales, but now our team members log on to the site every morning and base their plans entirely according to its predictions.' Retailers pay an undisclosed sum to the Met Office for access to the site, which combines records of general and store-specific sales statistics with long-term weather records to create an instant picture of how the weather has affected the performance of each store. The Met Office hopes the site will reduce the threat of further government cuts. Chancellor Gordon Brown ordered the closure of five weather centres earlier this year. Trends discovered by Engage show that the public's yen for hot, buttered toast in cold weather sends sales of bread soaring in bad weather, while demand for cold and flu remedies rises during mild weather as incubating germs inflict summer colds. Other discoveries are that sales of cat food fall in extremes of hot and cold weather while toilet paper sales increase by around 20,000 packs a month during early summer as hay-fever sufferers become afflicted by the rising pollen count.",

      "body": "<p>Alastair Campbell sat alone in Downing Street and flicked on the television. The Prime Minister's official spokesman was in relaxed mood, every now and then indulging in his well-practised habit of leaning back in his chair and propping his feet on the desk.</p> <p>That morning's newspapers had been full of headlines about the Prime Minister's speech to the Women's Institute. 'Blair's back with an appeal to tradition,' said the Daily Telegraph . 'Blair retreats from class war to the safety of old values,' said the Independent .</p> <p>Campbell's briefing to political editors the day before was paying dividends. The Government was back leading the news agenda after a rocky few weeks during which the Conservatives had suddenly found their claws and started scratching.</p> <p>On the screen in front of him - beyond the desk piled with briefing papers and along from the wall decorated with pictures by his children - Adam Boulton, political editor of Sky News, was reporting from Wembley Arena.</p> <p>Blair's big speech was just about to start. As Blair got up to speak, Campbell's world looked rosy. Thirty-five minutes later came meltdown. A turning point. A moment when the Prime Minister revealed an essential lack of judgment, a failure to connect with that key sector of the voting public - the fabled Middle England. Ever since that Wednesday morning effort to show the Prime Minister's 'big tent' credentials, the day the forces of conservatism got up and slapped him around the face, the Government has been on the back foot.</p> <p>The saga explains much about today's political landscape: the Government's problem with women, the New Labour message, the essential conservatism of a large chunk of British society, Blair's standing as leader, the rebirth of the Tories and the bizarre world of political spin. It is a story that stands as a picture of modern government and its relationship with the people.</p> <p>It is also a story about the two leading political parties. As Labour stumbles, the Tories have had success: Tony Martin, crime, pensions and asylum - culminating in this weekend's attack on the Government's European policy.</p> <p>This new mood in politics can be traced back to the first meeting of Downing Street's Strategic Communications Unit early in 1998. In the room were Siobhan Kenny, head of the unit, two special advisers - Phil Bassett and David Bradshaw - and Alan Evans, later to become John Prescott's media manager. They were there to discuss co-ordinating strategy and planning ahead. The Government needed to connect with women after concerns that their support for Labour was softer than men's.</p> <p>They decided to contact the WI, the Townswomen's Guild, and a raft of women's magazines, many of which had been knocking on Downing Street's door asking for greater access.</p> <p>Eileen Meadmore,the WI chairwoman, was asked if she would like to meet to discuss closer connections with the Government. Meadmore agreed.The Government saw it as a useful way of getting its message out. It was the first step to last week's disaster.</p> <p>A few weeks later Siobhan Kenny, arrived at WIheadquarters with a high-powered team concerned with women's issues. .</p> <p>With Meadmore, they planned a series of question and answer sessions to be published in the WI magazine, Home and Country . Prescott would do the first, followed by the Women's Minister, Tessa Jowell, and other members of the Government.</p> <p>The series worked, the message was getting out. Everybody was relaxed. It was the next step to last week's disaster. Meadmore asked if Blair would consider speaking at the annual conference the following summer, 1999. Blair was too busy. How about 2000?</p> <p>This would be a big event at which thousands of members would expect a major speaker. It was, surely, a better platform for Blair. Reynolds took the idea back to Campbell and Anji Hunter, Blair's diary secretary and key fixer in Downing Street. The date went into the diary. A ticking bomb.</p> <p>Last Sunday night Blair's inner circle heard their home faxes whirring. As the weekend came to an end, Blair - returning from his limited paternity leave - wanted advice on his first major speech since Leo's birth.</p> <p>He had written the draft in longhand at Chequers, his official country residence, before passing it to a secretary to be typed up. Blair writing a full draft himself is unusual. More often, he writes a series of key points and Campbell, Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, and David Miliband, head of the policy unit, write the actual words.</p> <p>This was different. Blair had laboured for hours about the key messages and how he wanted to put them across. Opportunity for all and a respect for tradition. Perfect Blairite territory. The speech was read by the inner circle - Campbell, Powell, Sally Morgan, Blair's political secretary, Miliband and Peter Hyman of the policy unit.</p> <p>Some faxed back ideas, a couple rang Blair to chat about his words. The WI's plea for a 'non-political' speech was taken to mean 'no Tory bashing'. Any references to the Conservatives were taken out. The speech had to be practical and refer to the WI's campaigns on breast cancer, Aids and domestic violence. Bassett had prepared a briefing paper for Blair on the history of the WI. The Prime Minister based the opening of his speech on Bassett's work.</p> <p>It was all very calm. On Monday, at the week's key strategy meeting, Charlie Falconer, Labour peer and Blair's political confidante, saw the speech. He agreed with the fundamental message. Campbell planned his Tuesday briefing. No one saw the elephant trap.</p> <p>So Campbell, in his office on his own on Wednesday morning, was left to watch with increasingly incredulity as a speech so well prepared, so well briefed, started disappearing in the slow hand-clapping and heckling. At first Campbell wasn't sure what the background noise he could hear from the television actually was. But as the cameras cut away to show the walk-out, it all became clear. Blair's face told the story.</p> <p>Campbell went straight into the lobby briefing - the daily jousting match between the official spokesman and Westminster journalists - his mind made up about the line to take. He would not attack the WI directly, but put the debacle down to a few bad-mannered oppositionists.</p> <p>After the briefing he admitted to friends that he had been too emollient about the WI, particularly when they suggested that it was Blair who had asked to be invited. 'That just isn't true,' he said.</p> <p>Campbell hadn't even bothered travelling to Wembley. He had decided to stay at Westminster for the lobby briefing. He wanted to push the message that many more trainee teachers were taking up positions at college. The message was lost.</p> <p>At Wembley, the fleet of cars ready to whisk Blair away contained a chastened set of occupants. In the front car Blair sat with Hunter. In the second car came Lucie McNeill, of his strategy team, and David Peel of the press office. McNeill had spoken with the WI director of communications about setting up interviews with 'modern looking' WI members who could give their reaction to the Blair speech. All the plans had to be abandoned. Hunter said she felt personally let down by the WI. Their rudeness had been inexcusable.</p> <p>At Millbank, Phil Murphy, the deputy general secretary of the Labour Party, was on the phone to the BBC - complaining about the use of Tory polls to lead news bulletins - when Boulton's report started.

      "bodyText": "Alastair Campbell sat alone in Downing Street and flicked on the television. The Prime Minister's official spokesman was in relaxed mood, every now and then indulging in his well-practised habit of leaning back in his chair and propping his feet on the desk. That morning's newspapers had been full of headlines about the Prime Minister's speech to the Women's Institute. 'Blair's back with an appeal to tradition,' said the Daily Telegraph . 'Blair retreats from class war to the safety of old values,' said the Independent . Campbell's briefing to political editors the day before was paying dividends. The Government was back leading the news agenda after a rocky few weeks during which the Conservatives had suddenly found their claws and started scratching. On the screen in front of him - beyond the desk piled with briefing papers and along from the wall decorated with pictures by his children - Adam Boulton, political editor of Sky News, was reporting from Wembley Arena. Blair's big speech was just about to start. As Blair got up to speak, Campbell's world looked rosy. Thirty-five minutes later came meltdown. A turning point. A moment when the Prime Minister revealed an essential lack of judgment, a failure to connect with that key sector of the voting public - the fabled Middle England. Ever since that Wednesday morning effort to show the Prime Minister's 'big tent' credentials, the day the forces of conservatism got up and slapped him around the face, the Government has been on the back foot. The saga explains much about today's political landscape: the Government's problem with women, the New Labour message, the essential conservatism of a large chunk of British society, Blair's standing as leader, the rebirth of the Tories and the bizarre world of political spin. It is a story that stands as a picture of modern government and its relationship with the people. It is also a story about the two leading political parties. As Labour stumbles, the Tories have had success: Tony Martin, crime, pensions and asylum - culminating in this weekend's attack on the Government's European policy. This new mood in politics can be traced back to the first meeting of Downing Street's Strategic Communications Unit early in 1998. In the room were Siobhan Kenny, head of the unit, two special advisers - Phil Bassett and David Bradshaw - and Alan Evans, later to become John Prescott's media manager. They were there to discuss co-ordinating strategy and planning ahead. The Government needed to connect with women after concerns that their support for Labour was softer than men's. They decided to contact the WI, the Townswomen's Guild, and a raft of women's magazines, many of which had been knocking on Downing Street's door asking for greater access. Eileen Meadmore,the WI chairwoman, was asked if she would like to meet to discuss closer connections with the Government. Meadmore agreed.The Government saw it as a useful way of getting its message out. It was the first step to last week's disaster. A few weeks later Siobhan Kenny, arrived at WIheadquarters with a high-powered team concerned with women's issues. . With Meadmore, they planned a series of question and answer sessions to be published in the WI magazine, Home and Country . Prescott would do the first, followed by the Women's Minister, Tessa Jowell, and other members of the Government. The series worked, the message was getting out. Everybody was relaxed. It was the next step to last week's disaster. Meadmore asked if Blair would consider speaking at the annual conference the following summer, 1999. Blair was too busy. How about 2000? This would be a big event at which thousands of members would expect a major speaker. It was, surely, a better platform for Blair. Reynolds took the idea back to Campbell and Anji Hunter, Blair's diary secretary and key fixer in Downing Street. The date went into the diary. A ticking bomb. Last Sunday night Blair's inner circle heard their home faxes whirring. As the weekend came to an end, Blair - returning from his limited paternity leave - wanted advice on his first major speech since Leo's birth. He had written the draft in longhand at Chequers, his official country residence, before passing it to a secretary to be typed up. Blair writing a full draft himself is unusual. More often, he writes a series of key points and Campbell, Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, and David Miliband, head of the policy unit, write the actual words. This was different. Blair had laboured for hours about the key messages and how he wanted to put them across. Opportunity for all and a respect for tradition. Perfect Blairite territory. The speech was read by the inner circle - Campbell, Powell, Sally Morgan, Blair's political secretary, Miliband and Peter Hyman of the policy unit. Some faxed back ideas, a couple rang Blair to chat about his words. The WI's plea for a 'non-political' speech was taken to mean 'no Tory bashing'. Any references to the Conservatives were taken out. The speech had to be practical and refer to the WI's campaigns on breast cancer, Aids and domestic violence. Bassett had prepared a briefing paper for Blair on the history of the WI. The Prime Minister based the opening of his speech on Bassett's work. It was all very calm. On Monday, at the week's key strategy meeting, Charlie Falconer, Labour peer and Blair's political confidante, saw the speech. He agreed with the fundamental message. Campbell planned his Tuesday briefing. No one saw the elephant trap. So Campbell, in his office on his own on Wednesday morning, was left to watch with increasingly incredulity as a speech so well prepared, so well briefed, started disappearing in the slow hand-clapping and heckling. At first Campbell wasn't sure what the background noise he could hear from the television actually was. But as the cameras cut away to show the walk-out, it all became clear. Blair's face told the story. Campbell went straight into the lobby briefing - the daily jousting match between the official spokesman and Westminster journalists - his mind made up about the line to take. He would not attack the WI directly, but put the debacle down to a few bad-mannered oppositionists. After the briefing he admitted to friends that he had been too emollient about the WI, particularly when they suggested that it was Blair who had asked to be invited. 'That just isn't true,' he said. Campbell hadn't even bothered travelling to Wembley. He had decided to stay at Westminster for the lobby briefing. He wanted to push the message that many more trainee teachers were taking up positions at college. The message was lost. At Wembley, the fleet of cars ready to whisk Blair away contained a chastened set of occupants. In the front car Blair sat with Hunter. In the second car came Lucie McNeill, of his strategy team, and David Peel of the press office. McNeill had spoken with the WI director of communications about setting up interviews with 'modern looking' WI members who could give their reaction to the Blair speech. All the plans had to be abandoned. Hunter said she felt personally let down by the WI. Their rudeness had been inexcusable. At Millbank, Phil Murphy, the deputy general secretary of the Labour Party, was on the phone to the BBC - complaining about the use of Tory polls to lead news bulletins - when Boulton's report started. Staff watched in silence as television screens revealed Blair's disaster. Many knew it had been a mistake. By tomorrow they would be in action. Blair went into Downing Street and straight into a meeting about that afternoon's Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Campbell briefed him to expect some 'grisly headlines' the next day - but they agreed that it would be a 48-hour wonder and that he still had to get his message out. Blair decided to make a joke about the heckling during his appearance in the Commons. By Thursday, the Government message was in a mess. The press agreed that Blair's speech had been misjudged. At that morning's nine o'clock meeting, the launch pad for the day's events, Godric Smith, Campbell's deputy, looked at a barrage of negative front pages. Lance Price, another senior press officer, was equally gloomy. 'In these situations the tone is one marked by a sort of gallows humour,' said one official at the meeting. 'You have to shrug your shoulders and get on.' They agreed that they would brief on the events of the day; the launch of a new set of Beacon Schools, the drug treatment agency, new training appointments. They knew no one would be interested, three positive stories would be lost. Millbank was brought in to start work on trying to redirect the story. The leaders of the heckling, Marion Chilcott and Chris Short, were put through Excalibur, Labour's computer database, to see if they brought up any useful, anti-Government, connections. Neither did.

'Carey is among those who point out that Labour selling its message to women voters is quite separate from delivering women-friendly policies,' the Times said, before quoting Carey as say ing: 'I haven't seen anything tangible coming out of this feminisation of the party.'

      "body": "<p>Most commentators have overlooked the fact that what happened between Tony Blair and the Women's Institute last week had a deeply personal element.</p> <p>They have downplayed what happened as a spin-doctor fiasco or a confrontation between Left and Right. The Daily Mirror has managed to present the WI as 'Blue Rinse Tories', more evil than the November 17 group.</p> <p>But this was no orchestrated political plot. Most of the women had booked their places at this event long before they knew the Prime Minister was coming.</p> <p>In interviews given subsequently, it is apparent many are thoughtful people with interesting, progressive views on sustainable development, the environment or rural transport.</p> <p>Of course, politics came into it. They didn't care for the 'party political broadcast' tone, and they didn't appreciate the renewed attack on the forces of conservatism, with a small 'c', since most probably still identify with that. Norm-ally, though, good manners and deference would have inhibited an attack on a Prime Minister.</p> <p>What happened was more complex and important, a spontaneous protest producing the astonishing paradox of the forces of decency turning on a decent man.</p> <p>What was it this audience of grandmothers heard and rejected in Blair's speech? I think they heard a boastful potency which neither valued nor mirrored their own exper-ience. Their slow handclap went beyond political disagreement. It was a corrective to hubris - of a politician, a father and a leader. 'What we saw,' says Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychotherapy, 'was, on a psychoanalytical or anthropological level, the power of elderly women against the male tyrant'.</p> <p>The message they delivered 'was a reminder that, however kingly the king, the mother has power'. This might sound fanciful, but the media seem to echo him; the blue-rinse brigade have 'humiliated' the invincible leader.</p> <p>Ironically - given the family focus of the WI - the subconscious trigger for this showdown may have been the birth of the Blair baby. It's no coincidence that this happened on the first public appearance of the Prime Minister after Leo's birth.</p> <p>The press had predicted the opposite: the nation would go gooey and Tony Blair would get a massive boost in the opinion polls. We have been told the Blairs are the nation's role model. Tony is a 'sharing dad', Cherie is an example for modern women; their family is an icon of the stability this society needs.</p> <p>Yet WI women will cer tainly feel differently. Theirs is a generation whose experience of mothering defines their identity. Most stayed at home with their children. They did not employ nannies. Nor did they ask their husbands, in far lowlier jobs than that of Prime Minister, to change nappies.</p> <p>They limited their family size because of financial and practical considerations, making sacrifices of their own desires and ambitions because they thought they were right for the community and their children as future citizens.</p> <p>The lifestyle of Blair's generation - my generation - are difficult for these women and many of us have at some point been on the receiving end of their ambivalence. One moment we feel our mother's pride in us as high-achieving daughters. The next, we en-counter the critical mother-in-law who seems to envy and disapprove of us.</p> <p>Family affection usually moderates these negative feelings. But they flare up again when the Blairs are elevated as the symbolic family. This is the ultimate have-it-all family; both parents in highly paid jobs, foreign holidays galore, nannies for the difficult bits and now a little extra Leo on top. Their lifestyle seems to say the sacrifices of the previous generation of women are meaningless.</p> <p>It's easy to see why these women might rebel when they hear 'community' - the ideology in whose name they made sacrifices - rammed down their throats as the cornerstone of a modern Britain which disregards them.</p> <p>Addressed by the country's leader, they would have been looking for validation of their lives and reassurance of a payback in terms of health care and the future of their local communities and environment. What they got instead was rhetoric.</p> <p>'Older women,' says Andrew Samuels, 'are highly intuitive. They know a lot but don't know how to express it. They often haven't had form-al education but they know a lot about life. What they heard was thin, desiccated, out of touch with these experiences. In psychoanalytic terms, what happened was a counter-transference, a nega tive hostile reaction that what they were getting wasn't true, wasn't real.'</p> <p>Currently spin doctors, politicians and some newspapers are set on discrediting these women as Conservatives (capital C). They are using offensive, sexist language about false teeth, grey armies and blue-rinse bri-gades. Such hostility only confirms that 'crone power' is potent and real.</p> <p>These older mothers are important not just because women over 55 are floating voters and could swing the next election. They are also symbolically important. Socially, the grandmother represents the voice of experience and, if her consent is actively and angrily withheld, a leader may not be able to lead.</p> <p>History provides plenty of examples of this. Before Blair's Ministers crack any more jokes about their fear of the monstrous regiment of grandmothers, they would do well to remember it was just such women who brought down the Argentine junta and helped destabilise the old communist order.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Most commentators have overlooked the fact that what happened between Tony Blair and the Women's Institute last week had a deeply personal element. They have downplayed what happened as a spin-doctor fiasco or a confrontation between Left and Right. The Daily Mirror has managed to present the WI as 'Blue Rinse Tories', more evil than the November 17 group. But this was no orchestrated political plot. Most of the women had booked their places at this event long before they knew the Prime Minister was coming. In interviews given subsequently, it is apparent many are thoughtful people with interesting, progressive views on sustainable development, the environment or rural transport. Of course, politics came into it. They didn't care for the 'party political broadcast' tone, and they didn't appreciate the renewed attack on the forces of conservatism, with a small 'c', since most probably still identify with that. Norm-ally, though, good manners and deference would have inhibited an attack on a Prime Minister. What happened was more complex and important, a spontaneous protest producing the astonishing paradox of the forces of decency turning on a decent man. What was it this audience of grandmothers heard and rejected in Blair's speech? I think they heard a boastful potency which neither valued nor mirrored their own exper-ience. Their slow handclap went beyond political disagreement. It was a corrective to hubris - of a politician, a father and a leader. 'What we saw,' says Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychotherapy, 'was, on a psychoanalytical or anthropological level, the power of elderly women against the male tyrant'. The message they delivered 'was a reminder that, however kingly the king, the mother has power'. This might sound fanciful, but the media seem to echo him; the blue-rinse brigade have 'humiliated' the invincible leader. Ironically - given the family focus of the WI - the subconscious trigger for this showdown may have been the birth of the Blair baby. It's no coincidence that this happened on the first public appearance of the Prime Minister after Leo's birth. The press had predicted the opposite: the nation would go gooey and Tony Blair would get a massive boost in the opinion polls. We have been told the Blairs are the nation's role model. Tony is a 'sharing dad', Cherie is an example for modern women; their family is an icon of the stability this society needs. Yet WI women will cer tainly feel differently. Theirs is a generation whose experience of mothering defines their identity. Most stayed at home with their children. They did not employ nannies. Nor did they ask their husbands, in far lowlier jobs than that of Prime Minister, to change nappies. They limited their family size because of financial and practical considerations, making sacrifices of their own desires and ambitions because they thought they were right for the community and their children as future citizens. The lifestyle of Blair's generation - my generation - are difficult for these women and many of us have at some point been on the receiving end of their ambivalence. One moment we feel our mother's pride in us as high-achieving daughters. The next, we en-counter the critical mother-in-law who seems to envy and disapprove of us. Family affection usually moderates these negative feelings. But they flare up again when the Blairs are elevated as the symbolic family. This is the ultimate have-it-all family; both parents in highly paid jobs, foreign holidays galore, nannies for the difficult bits and now a little extra Leo on top. Their lifestyle seems to say the sacrifices of the previous generation of women are meaningless. It's easy to see why these women might rebel when they hear 'community' - the ideology in whose name they made sacrifices - rammed down their throats as the cornerstone of a modern Britain which disregards them. Addressed by the country's leader, they would have been looking for validation of their lives and reassurance of a payback in terms of health care and the future of their local communities and environment. What they got instead was rhetoric. 'Older women,' says Andrew Samuels, 'are highly intuitive. They know a lot but don't know how to express it. They often haven't had form-al education but they know a lot about life. What they heard was thin, desiccated, out of touch with these experiences. In psychoanalytic terms, what happened was a counter-transference, a nega tive hostile reaction that what they were getting wasn't true, wasn't real.' Currently spin doctors, politicians and some newspapers are set on discrediting these women as Conservatives (capital C). They are using offensive, sexist language about false teeth, grey armies and blue-rinse bri-gades. Such hostility only confirms that 'crone power' is potent and real. These older mothers are important not just because women over 55 are floating voters and could swing the next election. They are also symbolically important. Socially, the grandmother represents the voice of experience and, if her consent is actively and angrily withheld, a leader may not be able to lead. History provides plenty of examples of this. Before Blair's Ministers crack any more jokes about their fear of the monstrous regiment of grandmothers, they would do well to remember it was just such women who brought down the Argentine junta and helped destabilise the old communist order.",

Every minute of the day, every day of the week, for the past five years, this ceaseless alphabetical outpouring - from the centre's hundreds of automatic DNA sequencers - has been displayed this way. </p> <p>What is being uncovered, before visitors' eyes, is nothing less than the genetic blueprint of humanity. Each A,C, G and T is a unit of DNA, and in a few days, having spewed out several hundred million such letters, that ticker will approach its first major milestone: the first working draft of the entire human genome. </p> <p>In collaboration with US government researchers, scientists at the Sanger Centre, backed by the Wellcome Trust, will announce they have decoded more than 90 per cent of the 3 billion units of DNA that determine our physical and mental characteristics. They will, in effect, have made the first biological blueprint of our species. </p> <p>'Think of the human genome as the Book of Life,' says John Sulston, director of the Sanger Centre. 'We are about to read the first proof copy, as important an understanding as learning the Earth goes round the Sun or we are descended from apes.' </p> <p>It is an astonishing achievement, one that reveals how life's mysteries are now succumbing to the onslaught of science. At this rate, scientists will produce their second, final, full draft of the human genome next year, or by early 2002, at least three years ahead of schedule. </p> <p>'We know we have now decoded between 88 and 92 per cent of human DNA,' Dr Michael Morgan, head of the Wellcome Trust's genome endeavours. 'We just have to run the figures through our computers to make sure we have pased the 90 per cent milestone mark.' </p> <p>It is certainly a dramatic achievement, though it has not been made without casualties. Indeed, the human genome project has become one of the most controversial scientific endeavours ever undertaken, riddled - as it now is - with exchanges of abuse, accusations that scientists are privatising the human soul. </p> <p>This hostility has been triggered, virtually single-handedly, by Craig Venter, the abrasive, ambitious geneticist whose intervention into the genome project turned a cosy academic enterprise into a bitter race that has provoked the consternation of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. </p> <p>It was Venter - backed by a vast pyramid of venture capital - who launched his private company Celera, based in Rockville, Maryland, as a straight competitor to the public international effort and claimed he would unravel the human genome's 3 billion DNA units quicker than they would, and at a profit. Give up now, he told genome scientists in 1998, and save your efforts for simpler creatures like the mouse. </p> <p>Now, two years later, Celera has produced its own working draft - or first assembly, as Venter calls it - of the human genome, and this weekend, like the scientists at the Sanger centre, its researchers will put their final, frantic touches to their first folio of the Book of Life. In the next few days, the world will find which team got there first. </p> <p>But the battle between Celera and the public Human Genome Project - a collective enterprise involving 16 different world institutes, with the Sanger Centre taking on by far the greatest workload - is not just a business of two outfits seeking precious scientific priority for a major discovery. They are divided by a far greater gulf: the very ownership of the genes of the human race. </p> <p>Venter aims to recoup his investment by selling his data to pharmaceutical companies and by taking out patents on the most promising genes he finds. These would form the basis of new medicines - for heart disease, diabetes, mental illness and cancers - in the next decade, he believes. </p> <p>But the idea that human genes can be patented this way, thus restricting their use to only a select few, is anathema to the Wellcome Trust, the Sanger Centre, and their US publicly funded counterparts. Indeed, the British Cabinet's chief scientific adviser, Sir Robert May, believes it would be a 'screaming disaster' if such patents were granted. </p> <p>Yet this is exactly what Venter expects. 'One hundred to 300 of the most promising genes - out of the tens of thousands in the whole human genome - that we find should be enough to give us a tidy return,' he says. </p> <p>But to do that, he will have to do more than just isolate a gene, which is typically made up of a few thousand DNA units. He will have to find out what protein that gene makes in the human body, and also work out how to interfere with its biological activity. Only then can he claim he has the right to hold a patent on it. Many scientists doubt if Venter has the resources to do that. Just working out the basic make-up of the human genome will keep him busy for the next year or so. He remains confident, nevertheless. </p> <p>The dispute is therefore about how medical science will proceed in the 21st century, with Venter, the research raptor who hunts genes for cash, encapsulating the approach of the ultimate capitalist, while John Sulston fulfils the part of the committed public servant. Certainly, the comparison is stark. </p> <p>Venter turns up at meetings in hired Jaguars, snappy clothes and a gold Rolex watch. When not checking the soaring price of share options, he sails his own yacht. Sulston runs a second-hand car, reads The Observer , and is opposed to global capitalism. Their only common denominator is science. </p> <p>However, it would be wrong to underestimate Venter, despite his upstart ways. He was a former medical orderly during the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War, where he started to ask himself 'big, naive questions', as he recalls. 'What is life in the first place? What makes it work?', he demanded. On his return to the US, he determined to find the answer and studied biochemistry, establishing a reputation as an innovative researcher, albeit one for whom the lure of lucre has been a prime motivation. </p> <p>By contrast, Sulston - the son of a vicar and a teacher - was a committed opponent of the Vietnam War and remains modest to the last, describing his work as nothing more than 'solid, middle-of-the-road science'. Money appears to have little appeal. In their different ways both have had a considerable impact on science, of course: Sulston in his quiet determined way, Venter in his role as a brash stimulator of genetic research - though scientists on either side of the Atlantic dispute his claims that his intervention was responsible for galvanising the human genome project, and bringing forward its completion date. </p> <p>'Competition is always good for efforts like ours,' says Dr Morgan. 'But the truth is that there were other, far more telling factors. </p> <p>'The development of new generation DNA analysers in the late Nineties dramatically improved sequencing rates, both for us and for Craig Venter. Similarly, we have come under increasing pressure from scientists to speed up our work. They have found our information so valuable they have pushed and pushed us to increase our output, and we have obliged.' </p> <p>For his part, Venter retains his main ire for British researchers. It was Morgan and Sulston, after all, who flew to the USA in 1998 immediately after Venter had announced his bid to privatise the project. There they pledged that they would double the United Kingdom's investment in unravelling the human genome, a move that restored US government researchers' dented morale, and raised the Sanger centre to the role of being the public project's prime opponent to Celera, much to Venter's annoyance. </p> <p>According to him, the Wellcome Trust - which has bankrolled Britain's entire \u00a3240 million involvement in the project - has merely involved itself in human genomics to try to cover up massive losses. It is not a point that impresses Dr Morgan. 'We are a charity. We can't hide our losses. In any case, if Venter had decided to co-operate with us, if he had decided to share the workload, instead of going into this thing as straight, competitive battle, we would be completing the full final draft, not the 90 per cent first draft, by now. </p> <p>'We would be a couple of years further down the path towards understanding our genes and their role in determining our health. That's why this stressing of a race is so harmful.'</p> <p><strong>Life's building blocks</strong></p> <p>Our bodies are made up of billions of cells, and each of these cells has a central core called a nucleus. Inside this nucleus are found the chromosomes.

Our total complement of chromosomes is known as the genome. </p> <p>We have about 100,000 genes parcelled up inside these 46 chromosomes and these are made of the chemical deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA. </p> <p>A total of about 3 billion units of DNA coil up inside the nucleus to form our chromosomes. These units of DNA are known as 'bases' and they come in four varieties: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Our genes are made up of different combinations of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts, a typical gene consisting of several thousand bases. </p> <p>Not every piece of DNA goes to make up a gene, however.

And a botched execution in Florida last week, where technicians took 33 minutes to find a vein to inject the poisonous chemicals intended to kill, has not helped their case either.</p> <p>Recent scandals over race, innocence and bungled executions appear to have put the death penalty on trial. The issue has enveloped the presidential race, as the spectre of innocent men and women being sent to their deaths haunts the candidate who has sent 131 people to death row - George W. Bush, Governor of Texas, overseer of the busiest execution system in the Western world.</p> <p>In his autobiography, Bush writes that 'the worst nightmare for a death penalty supporter, and of anyone who believes in our criminal justice system, is to execute an innocent man'.</p> <p>As one state, New Hampshire, becomes the first to abandon the death penalty and another, Illinois, imposes a moratorium after 13 men on death row were proved inno cent. Bush said recently that he was convinced that all 131 convicts executed 'under my watch' in Texas were guilty. He likes the death penalty to be, he says, 'swift and sure'.</p> <p>But a former judge on the Texas bench, Charles Bard, in Washington to announce the launching of a committee to stop wrongful convictions, cast doubt on the governor's confidence.</p> <p>When asked if he agreed with Bush that all 131 of the people executed under his regime had been guilty as charged, Bard replied: 'Everyone in Texas hopes and prays that is the case.

      "bodyText": "At least nine men were sent to death row in Texas after a psychologist recommended the death penalty partly because of the defendant's race, a review has found. The death sentence that prompted the review was thrown out last week by the US Supreme Court, after it learnt that the chief criminal psychologist for the Texan criminal justice department, Walter Quijano, had testified that an Argentinian, Victor Hugo Saldano, a convicted murderer, was a future danger to society due to his Hispanic heritage. Texas attorney-general John Cornyn began investigating in April after his office found problems with the Saldano case. The Saldano case is the latest embarrassment for supporters of the death penalty in the United States. Explosive DNA evidence has recently proved that several death row inmates were actually innocent. And a botched execution in Florida last week, where technicians took 33 minutes to find a vein to inject the poisonous chemicals intended to kill, has not helped their case either. Recent scandals over race, innocence and bungled executions appear to have put the death penalty on trial. The issue has enveloped the presidential race, as the spectre of innocent men and women being sent to their deaths haunts the candidate who has sent 131 people to death row - George W. Bush, Governor of Texas, overseer of the busiest execution system in the Western world. In his autobiography, Bush writes that 'the worst nightmare for a death penalty supporter, and of anyone who believes in our criminal justice system, is to execute an innocent man'. As one state, New Hampshire, becomes the first to abandon the death penalty and another, Illinois, imposes a moratorium after 13 men on death row were proved inno cent. Bush said recently that he was convinced that all 131 convicts executed 'under my watch' in Texas were guilty. He likes the death penalty to be, he says, 'swift and sure'. But a former judge on the Texas bench, Charles Bard, in Washington to announce the launching of a committee to stop wrongful convictions, cast doubt on the governor's confidence. When asked if he agreed with Bush that all 131 of the people executed under his regime had been guilty as charged, Bard replied: 'Everyone in Texas hopes and prays that is the case. I do not share his view'. Even members of the hardline Texas Pardons Board, which has rejected countless pleas for clemency and other appeals, are doubtful. One of them, Paddy Burwell, said last week: 'I worry that we may execute an innocent person. I think our system needs to be improved'. Bush himself is showing signs of concern over Texan judicial process, recently granting the first ever stay of execution in his tenure as governor, and allowing DNA tests on Ricky McGinn, a mechanic convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter minutes before his own death. But it is the question marks raised over the evidence of state psychologist Quijano that have created the greatest scandal, appearing to confirm what many ethnic minorities have long believed - that their high representation on death row was nothing less than racism. The death sentence that prompted the review was against convicted murderer Saldano, which was thrown out by the Supreme Court after it learnt that Quijano had testified at his trial that, since blacks and Hispanics are over-represented in jail, ethnicity 'was a factor weighing in favour of future dangerousness'. To impose death under Texan law, a jury must conclude the convict is a future danger. The death penalty debate in the US was emphatically reopened when the hardline Republican Governor George Ryan of Illinois - a long-time proponent of capital punishment - imposed a moratorium after new evidence exonerated 13 men sent to death row. Establishing the execution freeze, the governor said: 'I don't know if we'll ever go back to the death penalty as we knew it'. Public support for the death penalty is dwindling - a national survey in February found endorsement of capital punishment at 66 per cent, its lowest level for 19 years. Now, the focus is on Texas, the state that is America's unrivalled execution capital, and home turf of the man currently leading the polls to become the next President - and the focus is on procedure, evidence, DNA and race. Most prisoners on death row cannot afford lawyers and are assigned court-appointed attorneys. In a number of recent cases, these lawyers were found to have slept through trials. One of these was that of grandmother Betty Lou Beets, who had killed the husband who beat her. Her lawyer was regularly asleep, having been drinking heavily until late before the court heard of crucial evidence the next day. Other dead or condemned prisoners have been defended by court-appointed lawyers with extensive disciplinary records for professional misconduct. McGinn's lawyer was twice reprimanded by the Texas state bar. Last year, however, Bush rejected a Bill designed to improve legal representation for poor defendants. Now the attention is on DNA. In recent years, DNA testing has freed 72 inmates from prison, eight of them from death row. Bush himself was obliged to free two of them, both on rape charges. Yet only two states -- New York and Illinois - have mandatory DNA testing by law after the conviction of those sent to death row, as a final check. In the McGinn case, it took an investigator from outside the state and the superstar attorney Barry Scheck to push for the DNA testing, despite rulings against it by the state court and the board of pardons.",

Analysts had said the 1999 election of moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was Assad's last chance at a deal with the Jewish state to return the Golan Heights, captured in 1967 when Assad was defense minister.</p> <p>When his army regained a slice of the Golan in 1973 fighting, Assad himself raised the Syrian flag there, demonstrating the area's political importance. But Assad would not be hurried or pressured in talks that resumed in December after a hiatus of nearly four years. Negotiations were suspended again in January when Syria insisted Israel commit to returning to prewar 1967 borders.</p> <p>A skilful and ruthless politician, Assad often succeeded by keeping both foes and friends guessing, then suddenly reversing course when he saw an advantage.</p> <p>Syria put aside enmity with the United States to join the US-led coalition against longtime rival Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf war. Assad sent troops to help drive Iraq out of Kuwait, and later reaped diplomatic and financial benefits that included $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Assad could never be discounted in the Middle East equation. 'The Lion of Damascus' - his family name means lion in Arabic - was one of the Middle East's longest-serving leaders. He was credited with bringing political stability to a country of 9 million that had seen repeated coups since independence from France in 1946. Assad's bloodless takeover in 1970 was the last.</p> <p>Assad built a Soviet-style personality cult at home, his portrait plastered everywhere in Syria. His rise was an extraordinary feat for a man who began life as a peasant boy from the minority Alawite Muslim sect, born on 6 October 1930 in Syria's coastal hills. He plotted his way to power through the ranks of the military and the socialist Baath Party.</p> <p>He worked long hours and prided himself on managing the minutest details of his administration. His discipline extended to his private life - he was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol, but rumours about ill health have dogged him since a heart attack in 1983.</p> <p>He survived several reported coup attempts, including a failed 1984 effort by his ambitious brother Rifaat.</p> <p>Like his hero Saladin, the Kurdish warrior who defeated the Crusaders in the 12th Century, Assad dreamed of becoming the unchallenged leader of the Arab world.</p> <p>His attempts to rally Arab leaders against Israel gained little ground. He derided Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Jordan signed its own peace in 1994 and the Palestinians were pursuing yet another settlement with the Jewish state. Syria and Lebanon faced the prospect of being the last of Israel's neighbours to work out a peace deal.</p> <p>Assad's confrontation with Western-backed Israel led to close ties with Moscow during the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a blow, but also presented an opening for much-needed reform.</p> <p>Legislation meant to encourage private investment was enacted in 1991 but progress has been slow.</p> <p>Syria, historically a regional trade centre, has seen its neighbours rush into new technologies and a competitive global economy, while agriculture remains the mainstay of its economy.</p> <p>If ordinary Syrians are frustrated at being left behind they have said so quietly.</p> <p>Assad maintained a vast army of secret police and informers. His government jailed thousands of political prisoners without trial, according to human rights groups.</p> <p>Nonetheless, discussion of economic problems began to appear in Syria's state-controlled media in recent years. Occasionally, government ministers were criticised, though no one dared target Assad himself.</p> <p>March saw the first Cabinet reshuffle in eight years, part of the leadership's attempt to modernise the administration and eradicate corruption.</p> <p>Bashar Assad, his father's chosen heir, has championed economic reform and led the anti-corruption drive but it remains to be seen whether he has his father's skills.</p> <p>Bashar Assad's elder brother Basil had been groomed as heir, until his death in a 1994 car crash.</p> <p>Assad had three other sons and a daughter. He married an Alawite woman from a prominent clan. The presidential family was rarely seen in public.</p>",

But Assad would not be hurried or pressured in talks that resumed in December after a hiatus of nearly four years. Negotiations were suspended again in January when Syria insisted Israel commit to returning to prewar 1967 borders. A skilful and ruthless politician, Assad often succeeded by keeping both foes and friends guessing, then suddenly reversing course when he saw an advantage. Syria put aside enmity with the United States to join the US-led coalition against longtime rival Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf war. Assad sent troops to help drive Iraq out of Kuwait, and later reaped diplomatic and financial benefits that included $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. Assad could never be discounted in the Middle East equation. 'The Lion of Damascus' - his family name means lion in Arabic - was one of the Middle East's longest-serving leaders. He was credited with bringing political stability to a country of 9 million that had seen repeated coups since independence from France in 1946. Assad's bloodless takeover in 1970 was the last. Assad built a Soviet-style personality cult at home, his portrait plastered everywhere in Syria. His rise was an extraordinary feat for a man who began life as a peasant boy from the minority Alawite Muslim sect, born on 6 October 1930 in Syria's coastal hills. He plotted his way to power through the ranks of the military and the socialist Baath Party. He worked long hours and prided himself on managing the minutest details of his administration. His discipline extended to his private life - he was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol, but rumours about ill health have dogged him since a heart attack in 1983. He survived several reported coup attempts, including a failed 1984 effort by his ambitious brother Rifaat. Like his hero Saladin, the Kurdish warrior who defeated the Crusaders in the 12th Century, Assad dreamed of becoming the unchallenged leader of the Arab world. His attempts to rally Arab leaders against Israel gained little ground. He derided Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Jordan signed its own peace in 1994 and the Palestinians were pursuing yet another settlement with the Jewish state. Syria and Lebanon faced the prospect of being the last of Israel's neighbours to work out a peace deal. Assad's confrontation with Western-backed Israel led to close ties with Moscow during the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a blow, but also presented an opening for much-needed reform. Legislation meant to encourage private investment was enacted in 1991 but progress has been slow. Syria, historically a regional trade centre, has seen its neighbours rush into new technologies and a competitive global economy, while agriculture remains the mainstay of its economy. If ordinary Syrians are frustrated at being left behind they have said so quietly. Assad maintained a vast army of secret police and informers. His government jailed thousands of political prisoners without trial, according to human rights groups. Nonetheless, discussion of economic problems began to appear in Syria's state-controlled media in recent years. Occasionally, government ministers were criticised, though no one dared target Assad himself. March saw the first Cabinet reshuffle in eight years, part of the leadership's attempt to modernise the administration and eradicate corruption. Bashar Assad, his father's chosen heir, has championed economic reform and led the anti-corruption drive but it remains to be seen whether he has his father's skills. Bashar Assad's elder brother Basil had been groomed as heir, until his death in a 1994 car crash. Assad had three other sons and a daughter. He married an Alawite woman from a prominent clan. The presidential family was rarely seen in public.",

Along with countless Jews deported from Greece by the Nazis were socialists held in prison by the ruling dictators (who had taken power in 1936) and willingly handed over to the invader. If, as he suggests, the communists learned from the Germans, it was from the unenviable vantage point of a concentration camp.</p> <p>In fact if anyone can be said to have inherited the Nazis' mantle, it must be the barbarous post-war regime which produced its own version of the concentration camps on remote islands such as Makronisos, imprisoning and executing political opponents in vast numbers.</p> <p>It would have taken little research for de Berni\u00e8res to have uncovered widows of men who died in these camps, either directly at the hands of the rulers, or hanging themselves with their own clothing - men whose only crime was to write a critical poem, or simply to have a brother who fell foul of the regime.</p> <p>For him to seek, at this point, to lecture the friends and relatives of those victims of savagery is simply shameful.<br><b> Jeremy Henderson </b><br>Aberdeen</p>",

Friends of mine who met him in Greece while he was researching the book found him to be 'unbalanced on the subject of communists to the point of questionable mental health', and it was never on the cards that his book would be anything other than exceedingly biased. When Eleni was published, in English and Greek, it caused considerable uproar in Greece, far more than Captain Corelli's Mandolin is doing now, and a very competent rebuttal of his historical inaccuracies was published in response, but only in Greek. It seems a shame that Louis de Berni\u00e8res chose apparently to rely so heavily on one American's view of such a complex matter as the Greek civil war, rather than consulting indigenous sources where the general view is that awful atrocities were indeed committed during that period, but both sides were equally culpable. And that the problems would have been better resolved without the interference of Britain and the United States, given their existing anti-communist prejudice. Sylvia Rose London SE5 \u0095 Perhaps the most telling aspect of Louis de Berni\u00e8res' protestations concerning the furore surrounding the filming of his book is that he is so ignorant of Greece, its people and its history that he is seems incapable of understanding the profound insult that his distortion of history has inflicted. Along with countless Jews deported from Greece by the Nazis were socialists held in prison by the ruling dictators (who had taken power in 1936) and willingly handed over to the invader. If, as he suggests, the communists learned from the Germans, it was from the unenviable vantage point of a concentration camp. In fact if anyone can be said to have inherited the Nazis' mantle, it must be the barbarous post-war regime which produced its own version of the concentration camps on remote islands such as Makronisos, imprisoning and executing political opponents in vast numbers. It would have taken little research for de Berni\u00e8res to have uncovered widows of men who died in these camps, either directly at the hands of the rulers, or hanging themselves with their own clothing - men whose only crime was to write a critical poem, or simply to have a brother who fell foul of the regime. For him to seek, at this point, to lecture the friends and relatives of those victims of savagery is simply shameful. Jeremy Henderson Aberdeen",

High street bookmaker William Hill has a site (<a href=\"http://www.williamhill.co.uk\">www.williamhill.co.uk</a>) that links you to its spread-betting arm, although this will allow you to gamble only on sports, not the markets. There is even an online firm which offers advice to spread-betting fans. The site (<a href=\"www.sportsadviser.com\">www.sportsadviser.com</a>) offers a subscription service and has links to bookmakers' sites. Other big name bookmakers are expected to start offering online spread-betting services soon, possibly from tax havens such as Gibraltar which enable the gambler to avoid paying betting tax.</p> <p> To start spread betting you need to open an account. You can do this online, filling in a number of boxes to confirm things such as your age, telephone numbers (both home and work) and your address. You will be asked how long you have lived at the address, so the bookmaker can conduct a credit check. </p> <p> You will also be issued with a password.

Each time you bet you will be asked whether you want to pay gaming tax of 9 per cent on your stake or your winnings.</p> <p> If the idea of spread betting appeals, take care in your selection of bookmaker. Some of the companies operating in cyberspace are based in some fairly exotic places. If the company folds or makes a mistake, your avenues for redress are rather limited. </p> <p> The big name City spread-betting firms, in comparison, are licensed under the Financial Services Act which means, by law, they have to put aside sufficient cash to cover any eventuality.</p>",

Imagine what would have happened if Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp hadn't been sent off. He could have gone on to bag a hat trick - and the difference between the closing price (seven goals in total) and the opening level (2.4) would have been 4.6. Multiply this by \u00a3150 per goal and you end up having to shell out a whopping \u00a3690. There are numerous variations depending on which sport you bet on. And while you can reduce the damage by putting limits on the bet, it is still not for the faint-hearted. Addiction charities report that the most significant rise in compulsive gambling this year is from City traders spread betting on the net. Those who work in the Square Mile, it seems, cannot help turning their financial skills to other matters. Spread betting on Gordon Brown's speech is a perennial favourite in the City. Indeed you can bet on practically anything. Many bookmakers will offer spreads on the markets, everything from interest-rate fluctuations to the price of copper on London's Metals Exchange. And, increasingly, they are allowing you to do it online. In addition to IG Index, City Index (www.cityindex.co.uk) and Sporting Index (www.sportingindex.com) allow you to spread-bet online. High street bookmaker William Hill has a site (www.williamhill.co.uk) that links you to its spread-betting arm, although this will allow you to gamble only on sports, not the markets. There is even an online firm which offers advice to spread-betting fans. The site (www.sportsadviser.com) offers a subscription service and has links to bookmakers' sites. Other big name bookmakers are expected to start offering online spread-betting services soon, possibly from tax havens such as Gibraltar which enable the gambler to avoid paying betting tax. To start spread betting you need to open an account. You can do this online, filling in a number of boxes to confirm things such as your age, telephone numbers (both home and work) and your address. You will be asked how long you have lived at the address, so the bookmaker can conduct a credit check. You will also be issued with a password. Some online firms give you a choice of accounts, usually based on your attitude to risk. After having clicked through the options you will be asked to transfer some money into your account, usually using your debit card. Each time you bet you will be asked whether you want to pay gaming tax of 9 per cent on your stake or your winnings. If the idea of spread betting appeals, take care in your selection of bookmaker. Some of the companies operating in cyberspace are based in some fairly exotic places. If the company folds or makes a mistake, your avenues for redress are rather limited. The big name City spread-betting firms, in comparison, are licensed under the Financial Services Act which means, by law, they have to put aside sufficient cash to cover any eventuality.",

It's the same with all media: from newspapers to Channel 5, sex has been a driving force in boosting audiences. And the internet is no exception. More people look for sex on the net than anything else. </p> <p>But recently the UK purveyors of online adult entertainment have hit a wall. Fraud in the industry is running so high that the big banks, not to mention the likes of Visa and Mastercard, won't allow them to trade online. Instead, consumers dialling up an adult website now find, more often than not, that they are given a telephone number to ring if they want to subscribe to a service or order a product, rather than an icon to click on. </p> <p>The problems facing the adult entertainment industry are symptomatic of a wider malaise at the heart of e-commerce, chiefly the confusion over security for internet payments. The big e-tailers don't have to worry: they have developed their own bespoke transaction systems. But the smaller players enjoy no such comfort. </p> <p>This has huge implications for e-commerce - mainly on the question of whether it will take off as quickly as analysts and the Government expect. According to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Europe's online retail market grew by 200 per cent last year: the total value of transactions reached 3.5 billion euros. By the end of this year, that figure is predicted to have risen to 9bn euros. In two years' time, the total online retail market should, according to the BCG, be worth 45bn euros. </p> <p>But with the banks and the likes of Visa reluctant to get involved with many dotcom companies because of the high levels of risk, e-commerce appears to be heading up a cul-de-sac. But the impasse has created an opportunity for new players to fill the gap left by the banks. </p> <p>'The banks are paralysed,' said Nigel Wallbridge, co-founder of Global Internet Billing (GIB), an online payment solutions provider. 'They're pulling back from the market. This creates an interesting space for non-banks. Payment over the internet is going to be a huge growth area.' He singles out pay-per-view television on the internet and music downloads as two key areas likely to see their growth frustrated if concerns over the security of e-commerce are not ironed out. </p> <p>'There's a massive amount of shoplifting going on on the internet,' Wallbridge added. 'The banks see it as a huge risk because there are massive amounts of fraud. The problem has become so bad that the banks are not giving online accounts to new e-tailers.' </p> <p>GIB's solution to fraud concerns has been to develop a series of pre-pay charge cards which can be used to buy goods online. The company also offers a service that charges the costs of goods and services bought over the internet to your telephone bill. </p> <p>This may be attractive to consumers, but it is not a complete solution for e-tailers, who have to swallow hits from credit card fraud. Online consumers are able to obtain a refund if they can prove their card has been used fraudulently. But e-tailers have no such defence: they have to pay these costs, known in the industry as 'charge backs'. And while the e-tailer takes the hit, the company's bank will also have to process the charge-back claim. This costs anything between \u00a37.50 and \u00a320 a time. This may sound insignificant but when it is multiplied several thousand times, it is clear why the banks are reluctant to get involved with those dotcom companies which they consider high-risk. </p> <p>Couple this with the fact that dotcom companies have been known to go bankrupt, and it is clear that internet start- ups face some serious problems when trying to get established. </p> <p>As a result, several companies - known in the trade as 'payment solutions providers' (PSPs) - have emerged in recent years, aiming explicitly at the e-tail market. Well-known names include WorldPay (in which, significantly, NatWest has a 13 per cent stake), Secure Trading and NetBanx. </p> <p>These companies make their money by processing the online transactions of those e-tailers the conventional banks consider too risky. </p> <p>Critics of Visa and Mastercard argue that the confusion and widespread fraud permeating the e-commerce sector would not have been so rife if they had managed to develop their own online security systems more quickly. Much was made of Secure Electronic Transaction (SET), an industry-wide initiative that will see the introduction of a new automatic authentication system. Using SET, e-tailers would be immediately alerted when a fraudulent card was used. The system is currently being trialled with more than 100 pilot companies but, as a spokeswoman for Visa admitted: 'It has been slower to roll out than we anticipated.' </p> <p>For now, start up e-tailers have little choice but to use the new wave of PSPs, who don't ask to see two years' worth of accounts before agreeing to process a company's online transactions. </p> <p>Of course the quid pro quo for the fledgling start-ups that are regarded as liable to go bust overnight is that they have to pay the PSPs higher transaction fees. Whereas normal high street stores could expect to pay their bank fees of up to 2 per cent per transaction, the new wave of e-tailers normally pay around 4 per cent or more. </p> <p>'There is a feeling that they are having to pay excessive fees,' said Peter Jones of Payments Systems Europe, a payment consulting company. 'Anecdotal evidence suggests some companies, desperate to get going, are paying between 9 and 10 per cent per transaction.' </p> <p>And, of course, we, the consumers, ultimately end up footing the bill. The PSPs argue that cutting their fee structures is impossible because of the high rates they have to pay the banks. But unless the banks are prepared to accept more risk, the cost of processing online transactions will remain higher than in the high street - and the internet's bete noire remains.</p>",

      "byline": "Melinda Wittstock",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The all-points bulletin came at 9.30am last Monday, less than 48 hours after the internet news site APBnews.com had collected its latest, and perhaps last, award for excellence in investigative journalism. Staff of the hard hitting and highly respected site devoted to crime and justice learnt two things: crime does not necessarily pay, and justice doesn't always prevail. </p> <p>The money - all $23.5 million of it - had run out, chief executive Marshall Davidson told 140 staff crammed together in the lower Manhattan newsroom. Their 'speeded up' pay cheques would be their last from APBnews.com - unless a cash injection could be found within days. </p> <p>APBnews had become the latest victim of Wall Street's increasingly bearish outlook for content-driven websites following the 14 April meltdown of technology stocks on the Nasdaq market. Venture capital is drying up for internet companies, even if, like APBnews, they boast one million hits a day and consistent critical acclaim. </p> <p>'We were halfway through our game plan, and we ran out of juice,' says chief executive Mark Sauter. 'Everything changed that day in April. Until then, our investors were telling us to spend as much as we needed to expand into an international multimedia brand. Now they're only looking for small, cost-effective, immediately profitable sites.' </p> <p>But hope of a rescue was kept alive into this weekend, as APB talked to potential partners. It extended at least until tomorrow its deadline for a shutdown. </p> <p>The failure of privately-owned APB Online Inc to complete a crucial third round of financing came in a week that also saw significant cost cutting and big job losses at online magazine Salon.com, women's website and cable channel Oxygen Media and the CBS television network's internet division - along with the closure of the respected not-for-profit media website NewsWatch.org after an investor refused to stump up $1m. </p> <p>But such is the loyalty of the APB site's award-winning team that after Davidson broke the bad news, they gave him a standing ovation and vowed to continue working without pay until Friday - the company's deadline for finding a major media partner. </p> <p>'About 80 per cent of us are still here - every editor, every reporter - working to keep the site going while negotiations continue,' says Hoag Levins, the executive editor who built the scoop-driven newsroom. 'I've been in the business 30 years, and I've never seen this kind of loyalty.' </p> <p>APBnews made its web debut in November 1998, with live police scanner webcasts under the motto: 'to inform and serve'. Staffed by a mix of fresh-faced unknowns, Pulitzer Prize-winning veterans such as Sydney Schanberg - whose reporting on Pol Pot's Cambodia was immortalised in The Killing Fields - and big name columnists such as former New York City police chief William Bratton and O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, it had certainly lived up to its heady journalistic ambitions. </p> <p>Brill's Content, the US media magazine, had named it 'one of the best news sites' on the internet; TV Guide called it 'the CNN of police and crime news.' Major news sites including America Online, Yahoo!, Snap, MSNBC and NBCi were syndicating APB content, and just about every newspaper and broadcaster was following up its many scoops. </p> <p>APB could also boast some of American journalism's highest honours. Only last Saturday, Levins had celebrated a special citation from the prestigious Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc - only to be shut down two days later. 'No small irony,' he said, deadpan. </p> <p>'The lesson for every \"startup.com\" now seems to be: no matter how great the content or vision, you're entirely at the mercy of the markets. The irony here is that it was the internet that wildly altered the markets, introducing unprecedented volatility with day traders and the like, and it is that volatility that's to blame for the downturn in stock prices that has claimed our funding.' </p> <p>But unlike the online magazine Salon.com, forced last week by its Wall Street underwriters to cut 13 top jobs and slash costs, APBnews was meeting revenue targets. </p> <p>Launching its third planned round of financing in March, APBnews had raised another $3.6m before the April Nasdaq crash. 'We had been on target to break even less than two years from now, with total losses over four years of less than $60m. That's incredibly modest when you think of the sums other sites have haemorrhaged,' says APB corporate spokesman Joe Krakoviak. </p> <p>'But our investors are prepared to let great journalism go down the drain all because of current market conditions.

      "bodyText": "The all-points bulletin came at 9.30am last Monday, less than 48 hours after the internet news site APBnews.com had collected its latest, and perhaps last, award for excellence in investigative journalism. Staff of the hard hitting and highly respected site devoted to crime and justice learnt two things: crime does not necessarily pay, and justice doesn't always prevail. The money - all $23.5 million of it - had run out, chief executive Marshall Davidson told 140 staff crammed together in the lower Manhattan newsroom. Their 'speeded up' pay cheques would be their last from APBnews.com - unless a cash injection could be found within days. APBnews had become the latest victim of Wall Street's increasingly bearish outlook for content-driven websites following the 14 April meltdown of technology stocks on the Nasdaq market. Venture capital is drying up for internet companies, even if, like APBnews, they boast one million hits a day and consistent critical acclaim. 'We were halfway through our game plan, and we ran out of juice,' says chief executive Mark Sauter. 'Everything changed that day in April. Until then, our investors were telling us to spend as much as we needed to expand into an international multimedia brand. Now they're only looking for small, cost-effective, immediately profitable sites.' But hope of a rescue was kept alive into this weekend, as APB talked to potential partners. It extended at least until tomorrow its deadline for a shutdown. The failure of privately-owned APB Online Inc to complete a crucial third round of financing came in a week that also saw significant cost cutting and big job losses at online magazine Salon.com, women's website and cable channel Oxygen Media and the CBS television network's internet division - along with the closure of the respected not-for-profit media website NewsWatch.org after an investor refused to stump up $1m. But such is the loyalty of the APB site's award-winning team that after Davidson broke the bad news, they gave him a standing ovation and vowed to continue working without pay until Friday - the company's deadline for finding a major media partner. 'About 80 per cent of us are still here - every editor, every reporter - working to keep the site going while negotiations continue,' says Hoag Levins, the executive editor who built the scoop-driven newsroom. 'I've been in the business 30 years, and I've never seen this kind of loyalty.' APBnews made its web debut in November 1998, with live police scanner webcasts under the motto: 'to inform and serve'. Staffed by a mix of fresh-faced unknowns, Pulitzer Prize-winning veterans such as Sydney Schanberg - whose reporting on Pol Pot's Cambodia was immortalised in The Killing Fields - and big name columnists such as former New York City police chief William Bratton and O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, it had certainly lived up to its heady journalistic ambitions. Brill's Content, the US media magazine, had named it 'one of the best news sites' on the internet; TV Guide called it 'the CNN of police and crime news.' Major news sites including America Online, Yahoo!, Snap, MSNBC and NBCi were syndicating APB content, and just about every newspaper and broadcaster was following up its many scoops. APB could also boast some of American journalism's highest honours. Only last Saturday, Levins had celebrated a special citation from the prestigious Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc - only to be shut down two days later. 'No small irony,' he said, deadpan. 'The lesson for every \"startup.com\" now seems to be: no matter how great the content or vision, you're entirely at the mercy of the markets. The irony here is that it was the internet that wildly altered the markets, introducing unprecedented volatility with day traders and the like, and it is that volatility that's to blame for the downturn in stock prices that has claimed our funding.' But unlike the online magazine Salon.com, forced last week by its Wall Street underwriters to cut 13 top jobs and slash costs, APBnews was meeting revenue targets. Launching its third planned round of financing in March, APBnews had raised another $3.6m before the April Nasdaq crash. 'We had been on target to break even less than two years from now, with total losses over four years of less than $60m. That's incredibly modest when you think of the sums other sites have haemorrhaged,' says APB corporate spokesman Joe Krakoviak. 'But our investors are prepared to let great journalism go down the drain all because of current market conditions. And the tragedy is, even if the market regains its senses in six months, it will be too late for us. They want to see profitability right around the corner, but no one has ever gone from startup to profitability in just two years,' says Krakoviak. 'Just think where USA Today would be in today's conditions: it lost a billion dollars before it turned a profit, and now it is the most profitable newspaper in the country.' But even if APBnews finds a deep pocketed saviour among the big media goliaths it is understood to have been negotiating with, its difficulty finding finance is a harbinger of doom for independent and original content-driven sites. 'The prognosis is poor,' says media pundit Mark Crispin Miller, a professor at New York University. 'This should help dispel the hearty myth that everything lost in the old media will thrive in the new.

Last week's $24.3 billion (&#163;16bn) acquisition of Bestfoods, owner of brands such as Hellmann's and Knorr, was the culmination of a spending spree which has seen it mop up Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, SlimFast and Grupo Cressida in South America, all within three months.  </p>",

      "body": "<p>Niall FitzGerald, joint chairman of Unilever, must have felt a shiver down his spine as arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble announced the departure of Durk Jager, his counterpart at the US consumer products giant. Jager's successor, Alan Lafley, said: 'With hindsight, it's clear we changed too much too fast.' </p> <p>Unilever has been changing at least as much as P&amp;G. Last week's $24.3 billion (\u00a316bn) acquisition of Bestfoods, owner of brands such as Hellmann's and Knorr, was the culmination of a spending spree which has seen it mop up Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, SlimFast and Grupo Cressida in South America, all within three months. </p> <p>Then there is the small matter of Path to Growth, the restructuring programme announced in February, which will see it shed 10 per cent of its workforce, close 100 factories and cull 1,200 of its 1,600 brands. Will that prove too much, too fast, for Unilever? </p> <p>Naturally, FitzGerald is confident that it will not. SlimFast and Ben &amp; Jerry's may have cost $2.6bn between them but, for a company with sales of $45bn, those were small deals. Bestfoods may be much larger but, leaving aside the bakery products division which it will almost certainly sell, the business will account for just a quarter of Unilever's food business. </p> <p>The other parts of the division - and Unilever's other business - will be unaffected by the deal if not by the restructuring. Analysts say that part of the attraction of Bestfoods to Unilever is the quality of its management, and FitzGerald hopes that the 'vast majority' will stay. </p> <p>Certainly Bestfoods performance has been much better than Unilever's. Over the last five years, the US group has increased sales by 4.7 per cent and earnings by 14.7 per cent. Last year, its margins before depreciation were 18.4 per cent. </p> <p>That is a sharp contrast with Unilever, which has been struggling to increase sales, and where margins in the first quarter of the year were just 11.2 per cent. That is partly because Bestfoods brands are in growing markets: more and more of us are choosing convenience foods which we can cook quickly, such as Knorr soups and sauces, while trying to cut out Unilever's fats. </p> <p>Adding those faster-growing brands should make a dif ference to Unilever's performance: its sales growth target has been lifted from 5 per cent to 6 per cent, and it is now promising margins of between 16 and 17 per cent by 2004, up from its previous goal of 15 per cent. And it is promising some chunky synergy benefits: $750m by 2003 from eliminating overlaps and combining suppliers. </p> <p>If the deal lives up to its promise, it should be good for Unilever. But that is a big if. FitzGerald has proved himself one of the most able and innovative Unilever chairmen for decades. But even he cannot alter the fact that it is a big, unwieldy and inherently conservative group. Forcing radical change through a smaller, enterprising company would be hard enough. Implementing it at Unilever is, as P&amp;G's experience shows, fraught with pitfalls. </p> <p>That said, FitzGerald's record, combined with Unilever's lowly rating, means he should be given the benefit of the doubt. Buy, but be prepared to wait for results. </p> <p><strong> Going nowhere</strong><br> </p> <p>John Peace, new chief executive of Great Universal Stores, must envy Luc Vandevelde, his Marks &amp; Spencer counterpart. Getting sales moving at M&amp;S may look daunting but it is as easy as selling ice creams in summer compared to the task of stabilising a home-shopping business in accelerating decline. </p> <p>GUS did at least admit last week that it - or at least the previous management - should take the blame for failing to act sooner.

      "bodyText": "Niall FitzGerald, joint chairman of Unilever, must have felt a shiver down his spine as arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble announced the departure of Durk Jager, his counterpart at the US consumer products giant. Jager's successor, Alan Lafley, said: 'With hindsight, it's clear we changed too much too fast.' Unilever has been changing at least as much as P&amp;G. Last week's $24.3 billion (\u00a316bn) acquisition of Bestfoods, owner of brands such as Hellmann's and Knorr, was the culmination of a spending spree which has seen it mop up Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, SlimFast and Grupo Cressida in South America, all within three months. Then there is the small matter of Path to Growth, the restructuring programme announced in February, which will see it shed 10 per cent of its workforce, close 100 factories and cull 1,200 of its 1,600 brands. Will that prove too much, too fast, for Unilever? Naturally, FitzGerald is confident that it will not. SlimFast and Ben &amp; Jerry's may have cost $2.6bn between them but, for a company with sales of $45bn, those were small deals. Bestfoods may be much larger but, leaving aside the bakery products division which it will almost certainly sell, the business will account for just a quarter of Unilever's food business. The other parts of the division - and Unilever's other business - will be unaffected by the deal if not by the restructuring. Analysts say that part of the attraction of Bestfoods to Unilever is the quality of its management, and FitzGerald hopes that the 'vast majority' will stay. Certainly Bestfoods performance has been much better than Unilever's. Over the last five years, the US group has increased sales by 4.7 per cent and earnings by 14.7 per cent. Last year, its margins before depreciation were 18.4 per cent. That is a sharp contrast with Unilever, which has been struggling to increase sales, and where margins in the first quarter of the year were just 11.2 per cent. That is partly because Bestfoods brands are in growing markets: more and more of us are choosing convenience foods which we can cook quickly, such as Knorr soups and sauces, while trying to cut out Unilever's fats. Adding those faster-growing brands should make a dif ference to Unilever's performance: its sales growth target has been lifted from 5 per cent to 6 per cent, and it is now promising margins of between 16 and 17 per cent by 2004, up from its previous goal of 15 per cent. And it is promising some chunky synergy benefits: $750m by 2003 from eliminating overlaps and combining suppliers. If the deal lives up to its promise, it should be good for Unilever. But that is a big if. FitzGerald has proved himself one of the most able and innovative Unilever chairmen for decades. But even he cannot alter the fact that it is a big, unwieldy and inherently conservative group. Forcing radical change through a smaller, enterprising company would be hard enough. Implementing it at Unilever is, as P&amp;G's experience shows, fraught with pitfalls. That said, FitzGerald's record, combined with Unilever's lowly rating, means he should be given the benefit of the doubt. Buy, but be prepared to wait for results. Going nowhere John Peace, new chief executive of Great Universal Stores, must envy Luc Vandevelde, his Marks &amp; Spencer counterpart. Getting sales moving at M&amp;S may look daunting but it is as easy as selling ice creams in summer compared to the task of stabilising a home-shopping business in accelerating decline. GUS did at least admit last week that it - or at least the previous management - should take the blame for failing to act sooner. It is easy to see why they were reluctant to change. Home shopping through big book catalogues has been declining gradually for decades, but it still threw off masses of cash which could be recycled into more interesting businesses - property, consumer finance, Burberry and, more recently, ecommerce. Throw in a bit of inflation, which gave the illusion of growth in sales, and the business didn't look that broke.

Why? Because in the end people value specialised machines which enable them to do specific jobs, rather than a clumsy generalised machine which, with the right attachments, can do anything. </p> <p>Much the same will happen to the PC. Most people nowadays buy a PC because they want to send email and browse the web. But in order to do this they have to acquire an expensive, ludicrously over-powered, general-purpose machine which is extraordinarily difficult to master.

I was reminded of this many times last weekend when helping some friends come to grips with their first computer.

'Ah well,' I said, 'first you have to launch a dial-up connection to log on and then you need to launch an email client and then you ...' 'Eh?' they said, and who could blame them? </p> <p>The PC is doomed because the world supply of masochists like me is finite and already nearing saturation point.

The equity and investment boom has coincided with a squeeze on profit margins and higher corporate debt. </p> <p>The bank warns that 'a fall in US equity markets, coupled with a weakening dollar, could potentially exert a deflationary influence on the rest of the world'.

Even Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has given tacit approval. </p> <p>But make no mistake, this is not a bout of compassion. National self-interest is the driving force. Immigrants, legal and illegal, have played a vital role in the US in building the so-called 'Goldilocks' economy (strong technology-driven growth that nonetheless avoids inflation). Western European demographics also point to the need for immigration. The economic migrant will be essential, it seems, to protect your state pension. </p> <p>Analysis of migration has been traditionally couched in negative terms. Mass population movement has been closely entwined with slavery, bonded labour and expulsions. </p> <p>More generally, 'pub' economics leads to negative sentiment towards immigrant labour which is seen as displacing native workers from their jobs. This is based on the fallacy that there is a fixed number of jobs available. </p> <p>But economic development depends on waves of migration. The oldest 'stages of development' theories emphasise that rural-urban migration is a key engine of economic growth.

      "bodyText": "The term 'economic migrant' has pejorative overtones: would-be workers are vilified as sponging squeegee merchants or benefit fraudsters. But while politicians compete to reduce the incentives for coming here, the Department for Education and Employment is devising economic incentives to lure highly skilled workers - presumably also economic migrants - to fill acute skills shortages. In the US there are moves to lift the cap on foreign high-tech workers, and a remarkable coalition of conservatives, liberals and trade unions is pushing for a total amnesty for up to 6 million illegal immigrant workers. Even Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has given tacit approval. But make no mistake, this is not a bout of compassion. National self-interest is the driving force. Immigrants, legal and illegal, have played a vital role in the US in building the so-called 'Goldilocks' economy (strong technology-driven growth that nonetheless avoids inflation). Western European demographics also point to the need for immigration. The economic migrant will be essential, it seems, to protect your state pension. Analysis of migration has been traditionally couched in negative terms. Mass population movement has been closely entwined with slavery, bonded labour and expulsions. More generally, 'pub' economics leads to negative sentiment towards immigrant labour which is seen as displacing native workers from their jobs. This is based on the fallacy that there is a fixed number of jobs available. But economic development depends on waves of migration. The oldest 'stages of development' theories emphasise that rural-urban migration is a key engine of economic growth. Applied globally, this means that though capital is mobile, restricting labour mobility inhibits optimum production. Similarly, trade theory suggests that free movement of labour across borders is a necessary counterpart to free capital movements. Such theories are not just pie in the sky - they form the economic basis for the existence of the European Union.

It is not just periodic over-valuation, but the instability of sterling that plagues industry. When exchange rates are so uncertain, it is difficult for firms to make sales plans or determine labour requirements even a few months ahead, let alone make decisions to invest in new capacity which may take years to come to fruition. </p> <p>This is not just a British problem.

The recent difficulties in the motor industry are just one example. </p> <p>While floating rates have become excessively volatile, a return to the post-war Bretton Woods system of so-called 'fixed' rates is not the answer. Exchange rates need to be adjusted with changing circumstances, not left until weaker countries eventually become forced to devalue in crisis conditions. 'Pegging' currencies to a major currency, such as the dollar, raises similar problems. Currency unions, such as Emu, avoid this difficulty, but they are only a workable solution for groups of countries already integrated. </p> <p>The answer is to look for ways of managing exchange rates in a flexible manner. This must be done on a two-tier basis, regionally and globally - since it is only practical to operate such arrangements between a limited number of countries. </p> <p>There are lessons to be learnt from experience with the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The first is the need to adjust rates relatively frequently and by small amounts, rather than waiting to make major adjustments when they have become well out of line. For example, in an ERM-type system with +/-2.5 per cent bands, parities might be reviewed monthly and changes made in steps of say, 1 per cent. The new parity would then still be within the old band, and the changes in spot rates following the monthly review would not provide scope for the sort of major speculative gains associated with sterling's exit from the ERM in 1992. </p> <p>The second lesson is the need to build in arrangements for automatic intervention if the agreed bands are threatened. This should be the responsibility of a special fund with borrowing powers, rather than left to central banks with limited resources. </p> <p>Such an arrangement would be a particularly appropriate means of managing the relation between sterling (and the currencies of other EU members outside Emu) and the euro. It would leave open the question of whether we eventually joined, but stabilise the sterling-euro relationship in the interim. To benefit British industry, however, it would be essential to agree a competitive rate for the pound. But with the Emu authorities worried about the weakness of the euro, this could be a good moment to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal which would lower the pound and strengthen the euro. </p> <p>Such a new-style ERM should go hand in hand with arrangements to manage the rate between the euro and the dollar. This is particularly important for the UK. We should not want greater stability against the euro to be purchased at the cost of continuing instability against the dollar and other currencies. Such a limited arrangement should be expanded as soon as possible into a tripolar system involving the yen.

      "body": "<p>So the Oganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the British economy is converging on the eurozone, does it? Well, hang on a minute... </p> <p>There is a difference between the way the OECD's 'verdict' has been reported, and what it actually said. The key point is that the OECD (or part of it) has concluded that Britain is likely to be 'as close, or even closer, to the economic centre of gravity of the euro area' than some existing, or prospective, members. </p> <p>Thus the author of the OECD report is quoted as saying: 'If Greece is deemed fit to join, it would be strange if the UK wasn't.' You do not need to have been diverted from Oxford to Harvard to note that there are several deductive leaps in such interpretations. The fact, if fact it is, that some of the others have converged even less with the core European economies is not by any means reliable evidence that Britain is ready. </p> <p>The OECD is a centre of excellence and does not always speak with one voice. Its half yearly Economic Outlook contains information which makes me reluctant to conclude that British performance is quite as good as it is cracked up to be, or that we are converging on the 'core' economy, Germany. </p> <p>In its section on Germany, the OECD (writing a few days before the recent minor recover of the euro) notes: 'The euro has continued to depreciate, and despite last year's rise in unit labour costs, German competitiveness remains favourable.' </p> <p>Wow, I thought! Unit labour costs are a worry in Germany are they? Well, yes, up to a point: further inspection reveals that 'unit labour costs increased by 0.7 per cent in 1999'. Even closer inspection unearths the fact that unit labour costs fell in Germany in 1997 (by 1.1 per cent) and 1998 (0.6 per cent) and are expected by the OECD to fall again (0.6 per cent) in celebration of this millennium year. </p> <p>Perhaps, in raising interest rates sharply last week, the European Central Bank does not believe costs are falling enough in the 'core economy', but that is not my point. Let us now turn to the section on the British economy, where we find that unit labour costs rose by 3.3 per cent in 1997, by 5.1 per cent in 1998, by 4.1 per cent in 1999 and are expected to celebrate millennium year with a further 3.7 per cent rise. </p> <p>As every good Keynesian knows, the course of unit labour costs is the key to domestically generated inflation. 'Core' inflation has little to do with the kind of monetary statistics cited by the ECB in justification of last week's rise. The Thatcher government discovered this in the early 1980s. </p> <p>The good news is that Britain's core inflation rate is a lot lower than it used to be in the bad old days. It was because our unit labour costs tended to rise a lot faster than those of Germany that the pound had to be devalued against the D-mark over the years. It is no good saying, 'What good did those devaluations do?' The point is that they were necessary to put the British economy back on to level pegging with the German one. Otherwise our performance would have been even worse, because we should have been even more uncompetitive than we were. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the euro: it is fashionable to say that the Chancellor's convergence tests are irrelevant, because the eventual decision will be political. It certainly will be, just as Chancellor Helmut Kohl overrode all the economic conditions the Bundesbank would have liked to impose before German monetary unification after the fall of the Wall. </p> <p>But that does not mean Gordon Brown should not be doing everything in his power to make the British economy fitter, or less unfit, to join the eurozone. </p> <p>At a seminar last week organised by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Vincent Cable MP, the former Bank of England economist Christopher Taylor (now at the NIESR) made the point that the famous five tests did not include the exchange rate. The seminar was entitled 'The High Exchange Rate: a Problem for Whom?' But Ed Balls, Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury, gave the impression that one way of interpreting the Government's strategy is that it is trying to do everything it can to stabilise Britain's real exchange rate. </p> <p>This might seem odd at a time when the exchange rate - both nominal and real - is causing such manifest problems. The OECD calculates, by the way, that our export performance will have deteriorated by about 15 per cent between 1997 and this year. </p> <p>Given the trend of unit labour costs, the pound should have been falling in order to maintain price competitiveness. In fact, until its recent change of direction, it had been rising fast, thereby compounding the real exchange rate problem. And, paradoxically, the rise in the pound has been making our underlying inflation performance look better than it really is. </p> <p>Balls made it clear that he saw the Government's emphasis on stability as a way of avoiding the pressures on demand that traditionally exacerbate the trend of unit costs and hence the real 'exchange' rate. In this we evidently have some way to go. Entry to the euro would remove a devaluation as a means of adjustment. All the emphasis then would be on doing a lot better on core inflation than at the moment. </p> <p> William Keegan's book '2066 and All That', is published this week by Iynx, price \u00a36.99.</p>",

Let us now turn to the section on the British economy, where we find that unit labour costs rose by 3.3 per cent in 1997, by 5.1 per cent in 1998, by 4.1 per cent in 1999 and are expected to celebrate millennium year with a further 3.7 per cent rise. As every good Keynesian knows, the course of unit labour costs is the key to domestically generated inflation. 'Core' inflation has little to do with the kind of monetary statistics cited by the ECB in justification of last week's rise. The Thatcher government discovered this in the early 1980s. The good news is that Britain's core inflation rate is a lot lower than it used to be in the bad old days. It was because our unit labour costs tended to rise a lot faster than those of Germany that the pound had to be devalued against the D-mark over the years. It is no good saying, 'What good did those devaluations do?' The point is that they were necessary to put the British economy back on to level pegging with the German one. Otherwise our performance would have been even worse, because we should have been even more uncompetitive than we were. Which brings us back to the euro: it is fashionable to say that the Chancellor's convergence tests are irrelevant, because the eventual decision will be political. It certainly will be, just as Chancellor Helmut Kohl overrode all the economic conditions the Bundesbank would have liked to impose before German monetary unification after the fall of the Wall. But that does not mean Gordon Brown should not be doing everything in his power to make the British economy fitter, or less unfit, to join the eurozone. At a seminar last week organised by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Vincent Cable MP, the former Bank of England economist Christopher Taylor (now at the NIESR) made the point that the famous five tests did not include the exchange rate. The seminar was entitled 'The High Exchange Rate: a Problem for Whom?' But Ed Balls, Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury, gave the impression that one way of interpreting the Government's strategy is that it is trying to do everything it can to stabilise Britain's real exchange rate. This might seem odd at a time when the exchange rate - both nominal and real - is causing such manifest problems. The OECD calculates, by the way, that our export performance will have deteriorated by about 15 per cent between 1997 and this year. Given the trend of unit labour costs, the pound should have been falling in order to maintain price competitiveness. In fact, until its recent change of direction, it had been rising fast, thereby compounding the real exchange rate problem. And, paradoxically, the rise in the pound has been making our underlying inflation performance look better than it really is. Balls made it clear that he saw the Government's emphasis on stability as a way of avoiding the pressures on demand that traditionally exacerbate the trend of unit costs and hence the real 'exchange' rate. In this we evidently have some way to go. Entry to the euro would remove a devaluation as a means of adjustment. All the emphasis then would be on doing a lot better on core inflation than at the moment. William Keegan's book '2066 and All That', is published this week by Iynx, price \u00a36.99.",

      "body": "<p>Beads of sweat broke out on the Secretary of State's forehead, and it wasn't because of the bright sunlight pouring through the window of his spacious Whitehall office. </p> <p>'But John, you said you'd be able to hold it together for at least 12 months... the election's only a month away.' </p> <p>'I know Steve, but the bad news is the Germans left it in a damn mess, and we only found out once we'd done proper due diligence. I've done what I can but I'm afraid it's going to be 7,000 jobs gone unless...' </p> <p>It's the nightmare scenario. A month before a May 2001 election, John Towers comes cap in hand to Stephen Byers at the Department of Trade and Industry, asking for \u00a3100 million to bridge the gap between a cash-starved Rover and the deal - just over the horizon - with a foreign car giant that will secure the company's future. </p> <p>If he doesn't get it, Rover will turn into a niche builder of sports cars under the MG brand, employing 1,500 people at its once-massive Longbridge plant. The headlines are not to be countenanced. </p> <p>But what's worse is that on Friday 4 May 2001 - the day after Labour is returned to power - the wily Towers pulls out of the hat a miraculous deal with Volkswagen to build a new generation of cars, securing 10,000 jobs. The question of the \u00a3100m is lost in the post-election afterglow. </p> <p>This is a thoroughly hypothetical situation, of course, but it raises issues that are coming to the top of economists' minds. </p> <p>There has been much comment about the Government's abandonment of its early free-market credentials in favour of increasing intervention in industry. Examples have come thick and fast, from the 1998 Energy Review, which halted the 'dash for gas' and saved coal miners' jobs by restricting permission to build new power stations, to \u00a3530m for Airbus, \u00a3100m for coal (effectively RJB mining), \u00a3152m offered to BMW for Rover and last week's \u00a315m for textiles </p> <p>But what signals is this sending out? To some experts, this Government has opened itself to 'gaming' by big companies. </p> <p>Economist John Kay says: 'The Government has laid itself open to this kind of thing. In a way we have moved back to a situation which used to be the norm. We were unusual in having, during the Thatcher years, a government which just said no to companies which came begging.' </p> <p>There is evidence that as the pace of state 'rescue packages' has increased, companies have cottoned on. </p> <p>RJB head Richard Budge played a shrewd public hand over coal, issuing timely warnings of potential crises such as the closure of Ellington colliery, close to Byers's North East constituency, and even the efficient Selby super-pit in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Last month privatised rail operator Railtrack said the Government had to give it a further \u00a31 billion a year in subsidy if it wants the top class railway it has promised voters. And the week before that information leaked into the public domain on came British Nuclear Fuels, suggesting it may need more aid if Ministers are to achieve their long-term ambition of seeing it privatised. Steelmaker Corus and even telecoms giant Vodafone have not been above such tactics. </p> <p>The subject is horribly complicated - the more intervention there is, the less clear become the rules for industrial policy. The help sought is not always a direct handout. Influence on fiscal measures or legislation may be just as valuable. And the private, as opposed to public, negotiating positions between businesses and governments, and possibly the full extent of any deals done, may never become clear. On top of that, the law of unintended consequences takes hold. </p> <p>Kay acknowledges this, but says the problem is unique to this Government. 'Industrial actions never have intended consequences. Privatisation is the same as nationalisation in this respect. The Government set up autonomous bodies to oversee the industries, but it soon turned out that they did not work as planned.' </p> <p>So how is this Government different from previous administrations, particularly Conservative ones? </p> <p>Economists identify several factors. First, New Labour is more fenced in by European regulations than the nationalising administrations from the end of the Second World War to the Seventies. </p> <p>Second, it appears more prepared to be drawn in public on industrial issues and on specific companies and sectors than any Government for three decades. </p> <p>Third, as Kay suggests, it is less ready to leave regulators to oversee industries independently. </p> <p>John Quelch, dean of the London Business School, says: 'You might call it Dome syndrome. There is an enterprise that the Government wishes to be commercially viable, but which consumers still perceive to be the responsibility of government. </p> <p>'Also, Ministers are making comments regarding levels of service and performance, and reinforcing the idea that government is responsible for this. So the managers of that enterprise have the ability to go to government and ask for further support.' </p> <p>Kay points out that the sectors that have most leverage have close relationships with governments. Some are privatised utilities; some are transport or telecoms companies. Others, such as pharmaceuticals and defence companies, for example, rely on government as their major purchaser. </p> <p>In each case there is evidence that government getting involved directly, rather than via a regulator, has increased under Labour. </p> <p>For example, the Government has directed new electricity trading arrangements, framed a Utilities Bill to make companies reduce bills and become more 'consumer- focused', and pronounced on internet access charges. Firms such as Northern Electric, National Grid, BT and Thames Water have taken the opportunity to play on their relations with government in public. </p> <p>In pharmaceuticals, where the Government has introduced a new drugs evaluation agency called Nice, the situation is similar. Last autumn Nice decided the NHS should not pay for a new Glaxo flu treatment. Glaxo felt its viability in the UK was being undermined, and threatened to leave the country. </p> <p>Another key, and complicating, factor is jobs. Rover, RJB, and Courtaulds may not be regulated, or sell to government, but they all employ thousands of staff in Labour-held constituencies. </p> <p>Quelch says: 'The Government has not established clear criteria regarding what it is prepared to listen to. This sends the message that it is always worth queuing up to negotiate.' </p> <p>Beyond this, governments find it hard to resist the temptation to fix independent regulators, Kay says. </p> <p>Professor Stephen Littlechild, the first privatised electricity regulator and one of the key post-privatisation figures, gives several examples. 'When these industries were privatised, the government could get out of them, and the regulator would be left to run competition. </p> <p>'This Government wants to do things directly with the industries - for example, saying there must be 10 per cent of electricity generated from renewable [energy sources] by 2010. </p> <p>'And in the Utilities Bill that is going through, Ministers have the power to direct the regulator on things like environmental issues.' </p> <p>Littlechild believes the consequences are costly: 'There is a cycle to these things - the Government gets more and more involved, companies play along, then Ministers realise it is too costly and try and extricate themselves.' </p> <p>But there are sceptics who believe the Government may not be as soft a touch as is supposed. Tim Besley of the London School of Economics says that until clear figures are produced, proving Labour to be more interventionist, such arguments are purely speculative. </p> <p>And Cambridge economist Paul Seabright says that although this Government may be more involved than previous ones, it is not softer, and may be more knowledgeable. After all, it was Rover that provided an embarrassment for the Thatcher government when it emerged that British Aerospace had been offered 'sweeteners' to take the car firm off the DTI's hands. </p> <p>It is, however, the way this Government auctioned off third-generation mobile spectrum, generating \u00a322.5bn for the exchequer, that tells Seabright there has been a change. </p> <p>Instead of privatisations followed by reports from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee criticising the process for short-changing taxpayers, New Labour has shown itself prepared to bargain with business for public assets, which will no longer be undervalued. </p> <p>'The rules of the game are changing dramatically,' says Seabright, 'and in surprising ways.

      "bodyText": "Beads of sweat broke out on the Secretary of State's forehead, and it wasn't because of the bright sunlight pouring through the window of his spacious Whitehall office. 'But John, you said you'd be able to hold it together for at least 12 months... the election's only a month away.' 'I know Steve, but the bad news is the Germans left it in a damn mess, and we only found out once we'd done proper due diligence. I've done what I can but I'm afraid it's going to be 7,000 jobs gone unless...' It's the nightmare scenario. A month before a May 2001 election, John Towers comes cap in hand to Stephen Byers at the Department of Trade and Industry, asking for \u00a3100 million to bridge the gap between a cash-starved Rover and the deal - just over the horizon - with a foreign car giant that will secure the company's future. If he doesn't get it, Rover will turn into a niche builder of sports cars under the MG brand, employing 1,500 people at its once-massive Longbridge plant. The headlines are not to be countenanced. But what's worse is that on Friday 4 May 2001 - the day after Labour is returned to power - the wily Towers pulls out of the hat a miraculous deal with Volkswagen to build a new generation of cars, securing 10,000 jobs. The question of the \u00a3100m is lost in the post-election afterglow. This is a thoroughly hypothetical situation, of course, but it raises issues that are coming to the top of economists' minds. There has been much comment about the Government's abandonment of its early free-market credentials in favour of increasing intervention in industry. Examples have come thick and fast, from the 1998 Energy Review, which halted the 'dash for gas' and saved coal miners' jobs by restricting permission to build new power stations, to \u00a3530m for Airbus, \u00a3100m for coal (effectively RJB mining), \u00a3152m offered to BMW for Rover and last week's \u00a315m for textiles But what signals is this sending out? To some experts, this Government has opened itself to 'gaming' by big companies. Economist John Kay says: 'The Government has laid itself open to this kind of thing. In a way we have moved back to a situation which used to be the norm. We were unusual in having, during the Thatcher years, a government which just said no to companies which came begging.' There is evidence that as the pace of state 'rescue packages' has increased, companies have cottoned on. RJB head Richard Budge played a shrewd public hand over coal, issuing timely warnings of potential crises such as the closure of Ellington colliery, close to Byers's North East constituency, and even the efficient Selby super-pit in Yorkshire. Last month privatised rail operator Railtrack said the Government had to give it a further \u00a31 billion a year in subsidy if it wants the top class railway it has promised voters. And the week before that information leaked into the public domain on came British Nuclear Fuels, suggesting it may need more aid if Ministers are to achieve their long-term ambition of seeing it privatised. Steelmaker Corus and even telecoms giant Vodafone have not been above such tactics. The subject is horribly complicated - the more intervention there is, the less clear become the rules for industrial policy. The help sought is not always a direct handout. Influence on fiscal measures or legislation may be just as valuable. And the private, as opposed to public, negotiating positions between businesses and governments, and possibly the full extent of any deals done, may never become clear. On top of that, the law of unintended consequences takes hold. Kay acknowledges this, but says the problem is unique to this Government. 'Industrial actions never have intended consequences. Privatisation is the same as nationalisation in this respect. The Government set up autonomous bodies to oversee the industries, but it soon turned out that they did not work as planned.' So how is this Government different from previous administrations, particularly Conservative ones? Economists identify several factors. First, New Labour is more fenced in by European regulations than the nationalising administrations from the end of the Second World War to the Seventies. Second, it appears more prepared to be drawn in public on industrial issues and on specific companies and sectors than any Government for three decades. Third, as Kay suggests, it is less ready to leave regulators to oversee industries independently. John Quelch, dean of the London Business School, says: 'You might call it Dome syndrome. There is an enterprise that the Government wishes to be commercially viable, but which consumers still perceive to be the responsibility of government. 'Also, Ministers are making comments regarding levels of service and performance, and reinforcing the idea that government is responsible for this. So the managers of that enterprise have the ability to go to government and ask for further support.' Kay points out that the sectors that have most leverage have close relationships with governments. Some are privatised utilities; some are transport or telecoms companies. Others, such as pharmaceuticals and defence companies, for example, rely on government as their major purchaser. In each case there is evidence that government getting involved directly, rather than via a regulator, has increased under Labour. For example, the Government has directed new electricity trading arrangements, framed a Utilities Bill to make companies reduce bills and become more 'consumer- focused', and pronounced on internet access charges. Firms such as Northern Electric, National Grid, BT and Thames Water have taken the opportunity to play on their relations with government in public. In pharmaceuticals, where the Government has introduced a new drugs evaluation agency called Nice, the situation is similar. Last autumn Nice decided the NHS should not pay for a new Glaxo flu treatment. Glaxo felt its viability in the UK was being undermined, and threatened to leave the country. Another key, and complicating, factor is jobs. Rover, RJB, and Courtaulds may not be regulated, or sell to government, but they all employ thousands of staff in Labour-held constituencies. Quelch says: 'The Government has not established clear criteria regarding what it is prepared to listen to. This sends the message that it is always worth queuing up to negotiate.' Beyond this, governments find it hard to resist the temptation to fix independent regulators, Kay says. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the first privatised electricity regulator and one of the key post-privatisation figures, gives several examples. 'When these industries were privatised, the government could get out of them, and the regulator would be left to run competition. 'This Government wants to do things directly with the industries - for example, saying there must be 10 per cent of electricity generated from renewable [energy sources] by 2010. 'And in the Utilities Bill that is going through, Ministers have the power to direct the regulator on things like environmental issues.' Littlechild believes the consequences are costly: 'There is a cycle to these things - the Government gets more and more involved, companies play along, then Ministers realise it is too costly and try and extricate themselves.' But there are sceptics who believe the Government may not be as soft a touch as is supposed. Tim Besley of the London School of Economics says that until clear figures are produced, proving Labour to be more interventionist, such arguments are purely speculative. And Cambridge economist Paul Seabright says that although this Government may be more involved than previous ones, it is not softer, and may be more knowledgeable. After all, it was Rover that provided an embarrassment for the Thatcher government when it emerged that British Aerospace had been offered 'sweeteners' to take the car firm off the DTI's hands. It is, however, the way this Government auctioned off third-generation mobile spectrum, generating \u00a322.5bn for the exchequer, that tells Seabright there has been a change. Instead of privatisations followed by reports from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee criticising the process for short-changing taxpayers, New Labour has shown itself prepared to bargain with business for public assets, which will no longer be undervalued. 'The rules of the game are changing dramatically,' says Seabright, 'and in surprising ways. It will be difficult to predict how they will turn out. The Government has shown that it wishes to occupy the driving seat.' That may be true for assets in high demand. But a true sign of the success of the government's commercial touch in industrial investment would be a similar auction for a stake in Rover - should Ministers agree to provide any aid in the first place. Now why does that seem less likely? Rescues that went wrong Concorde: The Anglo-French joint venture was launched in 1962, driven as much by political motives (Europe) as commercial ones. Only 18 were built, costing the UK billions. Rolls Royce: In 1971 receivers were called into the engineering company. A state aero engine company was formed, while the car business was sold. RR was privatised in 1987. Upper Clyde Shipbuilders: UCS received funds from the Shipbuilding Industry Board set up after the 1967 Geddes report. It became a byword for 'lame duck' industry in the Seventies. Shipbuilding has never recovered. British Leyland: Formed in 1968 and nationalised in 1974. Renamed Rover in 1987, it was sold to British Aerospace, which sold it to BMW in 1994. They dumped it this year. British Steel: Another Wilson nationalisation, in 1967.

      "body": "<p><strong>Gemma Hunt:</strong> We had been kicking the football around in the back yard since we could walk. We used to live in Greenwich and there was a flower shop down the road run by a woman who played for a local women's team, and she said to my dad, 'You should take your girls to football.' We were nine when we first went to training and we have been playing ever since. </p> <p> We played at secondary school with the boys, which was a lot more physical. When it got too much, we used to stop. I prefer playing with girls. It's a different game, a lot more skilful, not as fast as the men's, just better all round. Most of the boys were behind us. But when we were 14, we weren't allowed to play with the boys any more. </p> <p> Our teacher at school had played women's football, so when we asked her to form our own team, she knew where we were coming from. We were the only girls in the boys' team, but as soon as they announced a girls' team, there were loads of girls wanting to play football, and we started an 11-a-side team. Our teacher would take us to different schools and we started a league. We started winning medals and it went from there. We moved to Dartford a couple of years ago, so we switched teams from Millwall to Croydon, which practises nearby, and were league cup winners and FA Cup winners last year. </p> <p> It's good being a twin, but then I don't know what it's like just being on my own. We used to fight a lot, but as we're getting older we get on better. But there is a downside. If one of us does something wrong, we both get blamed for it. We can't really get away with much because everyone knows who we are. We are not really competitive with each other, but there is a pressure to keep up. At the end of the day, we have to work as hard as each other and if Carly's in form, then she should play - likewise, if I am. Being sisters, we do push each other and back each other. If she gets tackled, I'm right there backing her up. I think we're quite aggressive players.</p> <p> We are always called Twinny, it's never Gemma or Carly, and then some people call us The Rottweilers, because we are small on the football pitch - we're only 5ft 2in - and we are playing against some really big women. But we don't take no prisoners. We are always at people's feet, tackling them. It's only in the past year that I've had my hair short. People can tell us apart now; they never used to. Carly's a lot bigger than me because she does weights. But when we are on the field, we wear headbands, and no one can tell us apart. </p> <p><strong>Carly Hunt:</strong> We finished school two years ago and did a one-year sports science course at college. Since then, we have been coaching kids on Saturdays and working with schools. </p> <p> We'll train twice a week for Croydon, and then when we have international matches, we'll train twice a day. We were 16 when we played our first match for England under-18s. I am the captain, and I have been called into the England seniors, but I couldn't go this year because of a cartilage injury. So I'm going to spend a final year with the under-18s. Gemma hasn't been called up yet. Hopefully, we'll both be going up next year. That's been our ambition, to play seniors and win the World Cup, which America holds at the moment. We've always done everything together. We both even play midfield. If we both get asked to seniors, great. Or it might take some time, like it did for Gary and Phil Neville. </p> <p>The FA is committed to making women's football a professional sport in 2003. We are only 18 now, so in three years it would be great to start playing professionally. It was annoying at school: we were technically better than the boys, and they could go on and play for money, whereas we couldn't. The only money we earn is what's left over from our expenses when we go abroad with the England team. It is frustrating. If we were men, playing at our level, we might be earning thousands of pounds a week. </p> <p>When we were at school, teachers asked us what we wanted to do when we left, and we'd always say we'd be professional footballers. They'd say that wasn't realistic, so I used to say I'd like to be a firefighter. So if the professional league doesn't happen, that's what we're going to do. </p> <p> We do get the odd comment about women not being able to play football, the women's game not being as good as the men's. We are not saying it's as good, it's a different game to watch. I think opinion is changing. The last FA Cup was televised - Gemma scored the winning goal - so the profile is growing. But the television series Playing the Field was disgraceful, and really set back women's football. That's not how women footballers are. </p> <p> Women's football is bitchy, but male footballers say it's the same. A lot of people say that we must be butch to play. But you've only got to look at us to see we're quite slight. We like to go clubbing, Gemma loves shopping and dressing up and music. There has been talk of a record company wanting us to bring out a single. We can't sing, we can't dance, but we'll give it a go.</p>",

Ah, I do miss them all. <br> Still, must press on if I'm to finish the last of my chores in time to get to London this evening to meet my old chum Constance, who I'm supposed to be going out to see a film with, unless she rings as usual the minute I'm leaving to cancel owing to someone more interesting having unexpectedly just flown in from Phnom Penh or New York or Neptune. <br> I return to my ablutions followed by a spot of work, so it's not until mid-afternoon that I suddenly remember how I was obliged to leave the laughable brown Metro at John's house last night due to faculties beyond my control, so it's up the hill 14 miles on foot to the village to take my venerable old boots to the cobbler's, buy a wholemeal TV dinner at the organic shop to get my body back into peak condition after eating instant noodles and Frosties all week, and pop into Oxfam with my equally venerable classic raincoat, which I have finally been forced to concede no longer qualifies in the developed world as a recognisable article of clothing, though arguably with the addition of a large turnip and a trilby it could still usefully measure out its days flapping about on a stick in a ploughed field. But then the stumbling block turns out to be the pet shop, where I'm supposed to get some wood shavings and straw for Lucky's bed. Imagine my surprise when the woman comes out of the back with two sacks the size of barns, which means me staggering down the high street looking like a haywain with legs, much to the entertainment of everyone I pass, in particular a group of street urchins who draw my attention to the trail of sawdust following me down the pavement. <br>Amazingly, I'm in town with plenty of time to hang around waiting hours for Constance to remember to turn up in her half-moon specs, which make her look perfectly brainy for reading in but do slow her down a bit when it comes to walking.

      "body": "<p><strong>I fall ill and my cover goes sick</strong></p> <p>I Have a Lloyds TSB Gold Service Account which includes free travel insurance, running from July to July. Last November, I booked a holiday to Canada and paid \u00a3180 deposit. In mid-December, I had chest pains which were diagnosed as angina, and I started treatment. In April, I told the doctor about my holiday plans and he said there was no problem, other than to inform the insurer. When I did, Lloyds TSB cancelled my cover on the basis that my illness was pre-existing. Yet when I booked the holiday I had no idea that one month later I would be ill. </p> <p>KS, Bristol </p> <p>Lloyds TSB regards conditions as pre-existing if they occur at any time before you start your holiday, however healthy you were when you bought the policy and booked the trip. This surprised me because I thought annual insurance was valid on the terms agreed at the outset for the whole year. </p> <p>Lloyds TSB admits it was wrong to tell you that your policy would not cover cancellation costs, so it will now reimburse the deposit if you change your mind about going. But the bank insists that it will not insure you to go on holiday. </p> <p>This is important for holidaymakers to appreciate, particularly if you have annual insurance, and could travel many months after buying the policy. Even if the wording indicates that you must inform the insurer if you suffer a serious condition before booking your holiday, companies will probably reject a claim caused by an illness that did not arise until after booking unless it knew before you left and agreed you could travel. </p> <p>This is standard practice with travel insurance, although most insurers will continue the policy, provided you are not travelling against your doctor's advice. Here, if you make a claim , the GP must write a letter confirming that you were fit to travel. </p> <p><strong> Saving in euros? On no account</strong><br> </p> <p>My wife and I plan to buy a French property. We have a \u00a310,000 deposit and, as sterling is strong, wonder whether it is best to invest this in a euro account until we find the home we want?</p> <p>DJ, Saffron Walden </p> <p>The pound has weakened against the euro, so it is probably not worth doing. Euro accounts pay little interest, anyway. Your \u00a310,000 is worth about 16,000 euros. The best rates are 2.75 per cent from Abbey National (01534 885000) and from Halifax (Isle of Man 01624 612323 or Jersey 01534 759340). Onshore accounts pay more than 6 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Mobile mistake: Sliced by Orange</strong><br> </p> <p>My Abbey National statement in February showed that \u00a3101 had been deducted on 25 January. The bank said it was an electronic direct debit set up by Orange mobile phones. But I have no such phone. Orange admitted the mistake and promised to refund \u00a3101, plus \u00a314.50 they had taken from my account in February. They could not explain why and how they had been able to take my money without knowing my name, or having my authority. </p> <p>LK, Lewes </p> <p>When the Orange operator was selling this phone, he typed in the wrong account number. Abbey National's system asks the operator to confirm that both name and number are correct. The operator, presumably without checking, said they were. Abbey then failed to spot that the Orange client's name did not match yours, and activated the direct debit. When you complained, Abbey refunded the money to you under the direct debit indemnity, which obliges banks to immediately reimburse their customers and sort out the problem afterwards. Abbey has now recouped the money from Orange. </p> <p>Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. Include a phone number, but not SAEs or documents.

      "bodyText": "I fall ill and my cover goes sick I Have a Lloyds TSB Gold Service Account which includes free travel insurance, running from July to July. Last November, I booked a holiday to Canada and paid \u00a3180 deposit. In mid-December, I had chest pains which were diagnosed as angina, and I started treatment. In April, I told the doctor about my holiday plans and he said there was no problem, other than to inform the insurer. When I did, Lloyds TSB cancelled my cover on the basis that my illness was pre-existing. Yet when I booked the holiday I had no idea that one month later I would be ill. KS, Bristol Lloyds TSB regards conditions as pre-existing if they occur at any time before you start your holiday, however healthy you were when you bought the policy and booked the trip. This surprised me because I thought annual insurance was valid on the terms agreed at the outset for the whole year. Lloyds TSB admits it was wrong to tell you that your policy would not cover cancellation costs, so it will now reimburse the deposit if you change your mind about going. But the bank insists that it will not insure you to go on holiday. This is important for holidaymakers to appreciate, particularly if you have annual insurance, and could travel many months after buying the policy. Even if the wording indicates that you must inform the insurer if you suffer a serious condition before booking your holiday, companies will probably reject a claim caused by an illness that did not arise until after booking unless it knew before you left and agreed you could travel. This is standard practice with travel insurance, although most insurers will continue the policy, provided you are not travelling against your doctor's advice. Here, if you make a claim , the GP must write a letter confirming that you were fit to travel. Saving in euros? On no account My wife and I plan to buy a French property. We have a \u00a310,000 deposit and, as sterling is strong, wonder whether it is best to invest this in a euro account until we find the home we want? DJ, Saffron Walden The pound has weakened against the euro, so it is probably not worth doing. Euro accounts pay little interest, anyway. Your \u00a310,000 is worth about 16,000 euros. The best rates are 2.75 per cent from Abbey National (01534 885000) and from Halifax (Isle of Man 01624 612323 or Jersey 01534 759340). Onshore accounts pay more than 6 per cent. Mobile mistake: Sliced by Orange My Abbey National statement in February showed that \u00a3101 had been deducted on 25 January. The bank said it was an electronic direct debit set up by Orange mobile phones. But I have no such phone. Orange admitted the mistake and promised to refund \u00a3101, plus \u00a314.50 they had taken from my account in February. They could not explain why and how they had been able to take my money without knowing my name, or having my authority. LK, Lewes When the Orange operator was selling this phone, he typed in the wrong account number. Abbey National's system asks the operator to confirm that both name and number are correct. The operator, presumably without checking, said they were. Abbey then failed to spot that the Orange client's name did not match yours, and activated the direct debit. When you complained, Abbey refunded the money to you under the direct debit indemnity, which obliges banks to immediately reimburse their customers and sort out the problem afterwards. Abbey has now recouped the money from Orange. Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. Include a phone number, but not SAEs or documents.

They paid \u00a346,000 for a tiny cottage when they left London for East Anglia 10 years ago and \u00a356,000 for a 40ft steel ketch. </p> <p>A small place was suitable because they intended staying only six months before sailing away. But Susanna fell pregnant twice in quick succession and in 1998 discovered she had breast cancer. So they had to put their adventure plans on hold and look for a larger home for Elise, now 8, and Hayden, 7. They found an idyllic clapboard cottage but had to fight off London weekenders who pushed the price from \u00a385,000 to \u00a3116,000 despite its dilapidated state. 'We bought a pile of rot in a bog,' says Susanna. They have since spent \u00a330,000 renovating the cottage and converting the loft. Brad, who is a carpenter, did much of the work himself. The local vicar bought their previous cottage and let them stay in it while they worked on the new one. </p> <p>Susanna is an actress but now spends more time teaching drama and looking after the children. Their income varies wildly, and this year they reckon to earn about \u00a325,000 between them. They have \u00a330,000 life insurance bought with their London flat, but they have not increased it since. Pensions are not high in their priorities. Susanna contributes about \u00a360 a month; Brad has nothing put by, except a small pension through the American Union of Carpenters and a $90,000 shares inheritance he would like to keep as his last link with America. If they cashed in the shares to fund the trip, they would have to pay a lot of tax. </p> <p>Susanna is not worried about pensions, as they have no plans to retire: 'As an actor, I hope to go on for ever. We are both the kind of people who go on until we drop.' But they are determined to achieve the sailing trip - next year before Elise starts secondary school. Susanna has thought of various ways of financing it: selling the boat when they return (although Brad is unlikely to agree); using the boat to earn money; filming or writing about the trip. They will rent out the cottage, in a popular sailing area, which should cover the mortgage and provide a small income. But she asks: 'Could we approach the building society for an increased mortgage?' When they return, they will want to borrow to extend the cottage further.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Joanne Cox</strong></p> <p>The most obvious means of funding the trip is from Brad's US shares. He could reduce the tax liability by cashing them in over the year rather than all at once, particularly as he will have no income while they are sailing. Or he could take an income from the shares. If they prefer a loan, they should start with the Britannia, where they have a track record. The share portfolio is probably sufficient security for all their borrowing and is a valuable safety net, particularly as their incomes vary. They need Britannia's permission to let the property and should establish their financial position should the property not be let for some time: do they need a slush fund to cover mortgage costs or will the Britannia allow them to defer their payments until they return? </p> <p>A letting agent can suggest appropriate rent, and they should decide on house insurance and whether or not to let the property fully furnished. Ideally, they should start saving now for next year with cash Isas, looking at internet, phone or postal accounts. Pension contributions can be made only out of earned income, so Susanna may need to cancel payments during the trip. She should check the implications of this with the provider or her adviser. </p> <p>They should start investigating travel insurance. Because of Susanna's ill-health, underwriting may take some time and, if left to the last minute, could delay the trip.</p> <p>Joanne Cox is a financial adviser with the Co-op. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Janine Starks</strong></p> <p>Susanna's ideas for financing the trip will not provide hard cash upfront. Their mortgage already takes them to retirement age, so they should not extend it. They could, though, release some of the equity in the house, arrange a secured loan, and use some of the US money. </p> <p>Flexible mortgages allow payment breaks but Britannia does not offer them and they could face penalties if they paid off their existing loan. As they obviously have a good relationship with Britannia, they should ask for a secured loan with a charge against the house; this is flexible because they can draw down money as they need it, although the interest rate would be higher. Touching the US money may cause a capital gains tax problem, but the longer they leave it the greater the problem will become. It is reasonable not to touch the money because it's their only retirement provision, but, in any case, their US investments need a full review. A more balanced portfolio would include investments in the UK, Europe, and other international areas. By rearranging their US investments, they can take advantage of UK tax benefits on Isas and pensions. </p> <p>They should reconsider their life assurance; Susanna's history of breast cancer will make insurance expensive, so they should start by increasing Brad's cover. </p> <p>Janine Starks works for Bath-based adviser Chase de Vere. </p> <p> Advice is for guidance only.</p>",

Susanna contributes about \u00a360 a month; Brad has nothing put by, except a small pension through the American Union of Carpenters and a $90,000 shares inheritance he would like to keep as his last link with America. If they cashed in the shares to fund the trip, they would have to pay a lot of tax. Susanna is not worried about pensions, as they have no plans to retire: 'As an actor, I hope to go on for ever. We are both the kind of people who go on until we drop.' But they are determined to achieve the sailing trip - next year before Elise starts secondary school. Susanna has thought of various ways of financing it: selling the boat when they return (although Brad is unlikely to agree); using the boat to earn money; filming or writing about the trip. They will rent out the cottage, in a popular sailing area, which should cover the mortgage and provide a small income. But she asks: 'Could we approach the building society for an increased mortgage?' When they return, they will want to borrow to extend the cottage further. Adviser 1: Joanne Cox The most obvious means of funding the trip is from Brad's US shares. He could reduce the tax liability by cashing them in over the year rather than all at once, particularly as he will have no income while they are sailing. Or he could take an income from the shares. If they prefer a loan, they should start with the Britannia, where they have a track record. The share portfolio is probably sufficient security for all their borrowing and is a valuable safety net, particularly as their incomes vary. They need Britannia's permission to let the property and should establish their financial position should the property not be let for some time: do they need a slush fund to cover mortgage costs or will the Britannia allow them to defer their payments until they return? A letting agent can suggest appropriate rent, and they should decide on house insurance and whether or not to let the property fully furnished. Ideally, they should start saving now for next year with cash Isas, looking at internet, phone or postal accounts. Pension contributions can be made only out of earned income, so Susanna may need to cancel payments during the trip. She should check the implications of this with the provider or her adviser. They should start investigating travel insurance. Because of Susanna's ill-health, underwriting may take some time and, if left to the last minute, could delay the trip. Joanne Cox is a financial adviser with the Co-op. Adviser 2: Janine Starks Susanna's ideas for financing the trip will not provide hard cash upfront. Their mortgage already takes them to retirement age, so they should not extend it. They could, though, release some of the equity in the house, arrange a secured loan, and use some of the US money. Flexible mortgages allow payment breaks but Britannia does not offer them and they could face penalties if they paid off their existing loan. As they obviously have a good relationship with Britannia, they should ask for a secured loan with a charge against the house; this is flexible because they can draw down money as they need it, although the interest rate would be higher. Touching the US money may cause a capital gains tax problem, but the longer they leave it the greater the problem will become. It is reasonable not to touch the money because it's their only retirement provision, but, in any case, their US investments need a full review. A more balanced portfolio would include investments in the UK, Europe, and other international areas. By rearranging their US investments, they can take advantage of UK tax benefits on Isas and pensions. They should reconsider their life assurance; Susanna's history of breast cancer will make insurance expensive, so they should start by increasing Brad's cover.

His clumsy relationship with Pat (an excellent Janis Kelly) is painfully convincing. Alice Goodman's text, written in heroic couplets and full of sharp humour, avoids the easy lure of cynicism which hindsight might legitimately have allowed. Her voice is every bit as distinct in this work as the composer's (though the ENO programme gives her puzzlingly short biographical shrift), her serious and skilful words a mature complement to his moments of Wagnerian caprice and jazzy pastiche. </p> <p>Shunning operatic habit, the work moves from public spectacle to, in the final scene, private contemplation, like a symphony unexpectedly ending with a slow movement then dying away quietly. This remains the most problematic section, not entirely resolved here and not helped by the dodgy string solos of the otherwise valiant ENO orchestra (though after three-and-a- half exhausting hours without let up, the closing bars are a rough time to be given stretching solos). </p> <p>Paul Daniel conducted with insight and energy, always allowing the singers, amplified at the composer's request, to be heard above the huge score, which adds several low clarinets, four saxophones, two pianos and keyboard sampler to the usual forces. Chorus and cast were first class. My one regret is that I can't attend the remaining five performances. Be part of the Great Leap Forward and go.</p>",

At last, in an exuberant moment of high theatre, the Spirit of 76 descends and the American President appears, followed by a scarlet-clad First Lady. A perfect ballet of bows and handshakes with Chou En-lai (the sensitive baritone David Kempster) takes place on the tarmac. Almost at once, Nixon breaks into the dazzling 'News' aria which, like Madame Mao's chilling coloratura aria ('I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung') and 'The Chairman Dances', has become familiar through concert performance. The only surviving cast member is the baritone James Maddalena, formidable in the title role. So unnervingly faithful is his Nixon, with receding hair-line, chipmunk nose and a spectrum of facial twitches now spiced with a warming touch of Tony Blair, it's hard to imagine anyone else ever daring to play the part. He sings expressively and endows his character with moving dignity, which makes his vanity and folly all the more human. His clumsy relationship with Pat (an excellent Janis Kelly) is painfully convincing. Alice Goodman's text, written in heroic couplets and full of sharp humour, avoids the easy lure of cynicism which hindsight might legitimately have allowed. Her voice is every bit as distinct in this work as the composer's (though the ENO programme gives her puzzlingly short biographical shrift), her serious and skilful words a mature complement to his moments of Wagnerian caprice and jazzy pastiche. Shunning operatic habit, the work moves from public spectacle to, in the final scene, private contemplation, like a symphony unexpectedly ending with a slow movement then dying away quietly. This remains the most problematic section, not entirely resolved here and not helped by the dodgy string solos of the otherwise valiant ENO orchestra (though after three-and-a- half exhausting hours without let up, the closing bars are a rough time to be given stretching solos). Paul Daniel conducted with insight and energy, always allowing the singers, amplified at the composer's request, to be heard above the huge score, which adds several low clarinets, four saxophones, two pianos and keyboard sampler to the usual forces. Chorus and cast were first class. My one regret is that I can't attend the remaining five performances. Be part of the Great Leap Forward and go.",

Directed by Heddy Honigmann </p> <p><strong> The Barber of Siberia </strong> (195mins,12). Directed by Nikita Mikhalkov; starring Julia Ormond, Richard Harris </p> <p>Samantha Morton doesn't say a word. She is Hattie in <strong> Sweet and Lowdown</strong>, and also its heart. 'It's my day off, and I want a talking girl,' Sean Penn complains to begin with. 'Goddamn mute, orphan half-wits,' he adds shortly thereafter. This is a modest return to directorial form by Woody Allen after the barren Celebrity . He wrote it years ago and took it off the shelf in critical adversity, a return to roots. </p> <p>Penn, all primped hair and horrendously tight suits, is Emmet Ray, the allegedly second greatest jazz guitarist (after Django) of the Thirties. A warped ego; a chauvinist pig; a pimp; a drunk, coward and kleptomaniac. But magic when he plucks the strings. Morton, in this phoney docubiography, is the girl he met on the boardwalk, lived with for a year and never quite got out of his pathetic system. </p> <p>Penn gives another virtuoso performance, the genius with a heart of crud. The chuckles, if not outright laughs, keep coming. Maybe it tails away a bit as Penn moves on to marry Uma Thurman's randy socialite or grow desperate with Gretchen Moll's blank floozy. Nevertheless, the essential pathos is there. </p> <p>He's a shell who needs his silent partner, Morton's wonderfully mobile face moving from adoration to desolation, a mime of the mind. When she's gone, he is gone as well. This is Woody in a minor key: rich, witty and evocative - neither challenging nor profound. It works, though, and Morton doesn't need a single line, never mind a one-liner. A true actress in a great week for actresses. </p> <p>Saffron Burrows is not, by any means, the only good thing about <strong> Gangster No.1</strong>; but after an iffy run of parts she is notably fine as a mobster's moll with a faithful heart. Burrows, long, feisty and talking the London lingo she grew up with, needs a director who brings out the best in his cast. Paul McGuigan, going big screen after the triumphs of The Acid House , is clearly that. </p> <p>There isn't a false note in this artfully structured saga of gang life through the past 30 years. Paul Bettany, with baby face and Cagney eyes, plays No.1, an upwardly muscular hood from the tower blocks who falls under the spell of the local Mr Big, Freddy Mays (David Thewlis). Together, they rampage, maim and extort in the hallowed Kray way. </p> <p>But Thewlis falls for Burrows and (as hooligans do) begins to grow gooey. Bettany, passion thwarted, stitches him up and sends him away until the present day, when the prison doors swing open. Now No.1 has metamorphosed with the years into Malcolm McDowell, a monster of angst and bravado, who somehow has to get Mays - the love and the hate - out of his system. </p> <p>What, a British gangster movie with a touch of class? Undoubtedly. Much of this adaptation of the stage play by Louis Mellis and David Scinto seethes with a raw energy, exploring a dark world where everyone's a victim. McDowell doesn't go over the top for once; Bettany will be a star; Burrows shows what she can do. </p> <p>You may not like it - some of the violence is not even for bravehearts; you've probably seen too much of this concrete hell too many times; and Johnny Ferguson's script never entirely shakes off the curse of the stage setpiece, especially at the contrived denouement - But score Number One for burgeoning talent. </p> <p>Ashley Judd, she of the chipmunk smile and haunting eyes, is a star without modern parallel, a child of the Forties reincarnated. Last year, she was June Allyson, radiant mum, in Double Jeopardy , battling wife fighting back. <strong> Eye of the Beholder</strong> makes a Gene Tierney of her: a beautiful, serially driven murderess who bewitches a British secret service agent with domestic troubles of his own (Ewan McGregor). She drags him, in obsessive love, across the cities of America and the wastelands of Alaska as her guardian angel. </p> <p>Stephan Elliott, from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert , doesn't really know whether this is macabre romance or portentous thriller. McGregor is required to be pretty anonymous again - and spends (our) taxpayers' money so lavishly that Gordon Brown might drop Oxbridge and turn on MI6. Higher tosh! But Judd, clothed by Valentino in dresses to die for, is a treat, the undoubted reason why this was a brief box-office champion in the States. </p> <p>And the other big question about romantic comedies - endlessly recycled across the movies of the past two years - is, of course: who's taking who to the high-school prom? <strong> Drive Me Crazy</strong> has nothing original to offer by way of answers. The two stars get it together. Why else are they stars? But Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina the resting teenage witch) and Adrian Grenier are winsome enough, more able than usual to make up their own minds. Rob Thomas's screenplay has some nice sight gags, as when Hart drops her mobile phone from a great height on to a screaming cat. John Schultz directs with an amiable zest. </p> <p>It isn't great, but it isn't bad, and it prompts only one big question in return. Why are America's teen turn-ons, as here, always a good six years older in real life than the characters they play? Hart looks like a pastier Doris Day; Grenier is out of university, never mind college. Do their audiences want to pile on the years of self-identifying maturity? And, if so, when do they want to start shedding them again? </p> <p>Recipe time (1). Take no money worth talking about, one Dutch documentary maker (Henny Honigman) and an original idea. Call it <strong> The Underground Orchestra</strong>. Go to Paris, go to the Metro, and talk to the street musicians scraping a living. </p> <p>They are the dispossessed of the globe; from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Arabia, Latin America. They have trouble with visas and landlords and the police. But they love their music and play it well - and so they become defined human beings to us, not statistics on some asylum-seekers' chart. </p> <p>They are artists we can relate to, and are thus infinitely sympathetic. It is a brilliant notion, brilliantly executed. What's the difference between political and economic refugees? Nothing here. They are all people like us. We bleed when they bleed. The Romanians on the streets have never been so human or so comprehensible. Bring Ann Widdecombe or Jack Straw if you see them in the foyer - but go. </p> <p>Recipe time (2). Take $35 million and one lauded Russian director (Nikita Mikhalkov). Mix Dr Zhivago, Titanic and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Season with talent from seven European countries and decorate with sumptuous scenes from inside the Kremlin. Add passionate love, heartbreak, tragedy, outrageous comedy. </p> <p>It's got everything, so surely it must be a Hollywood-shaking success, a bombe surprise ? No, it's <strong> The Barber of Siberia</strong>. Just a bomb. This Barber opened at Cannes last year and exited to boos and groans. It has not been much heard of since. </p> <p>The unluckiest actress of the week, Julia Ormond, working to Mikhalkov's own screenplay, is a seasoned American adventuress in1885 Moscow, recruited by Richard Harris, a crazed inventor of the monstrous tree-felling machine he calls his barber, to con development cash out of Tsar Alexander the Third (the modest Mikhalkov again). </p> <p>She falls for a young mili tary cadet called Tolstoy (Oleg Menshikov). He falls even harder for her. Thereafter, amid much epic to-and-froing across continents and decades, everything falls apart. To be fair, some audiences (Eastern European ones especially) seem to have found this operatic blending of emotions ripely enchanting, but that can only be a question of national taste. </p> <p>Here it just feels odd and dislocated, which makes it almost impossible for the imported actors. Menshikov, touching 40, plays 22 with total self-belief, but Harris resorts to berserk grotesque and Ormond is a true victim. She is a competent, comely non-star of an actress. Here, she's supposed to be Audrey Hepburn (in War and Peace), Julie Christie and Garbo rolled into an impossible bundle. Mikhalkov has a damnable habit of shooting her straight on, emoting, to camera. Cruel impossibility. She's innocent, OK? </p> <p>This is a disaster without villainesses.We learn two things. That you can only make memorable movies (like Oblomov ) if you stick to what you know, stay with your cultural roots, forget pastiche Hollywood. And, second, that time can be an implacable enemy. This Barber lasts for three hours. You go in feeling spruce and you stagger into the light needing a haircut.</p>",

The first was George Mitchell's description in <strong> Once We Were Warriors</strong> (Radio 5) of a wrestling match between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy. Five million viewers, mainly women, switched on regularly every Saturday afternoon in the Seventies to watch fighters such as Mick McManus and Jackie Pallo slug it out in the ring on ITV. As examples of beefcake they were prodigious, nay awesome, but still sufficiently nimble on their feet to chuck each other about and put on an entertaining show. Sometimes they got so excited the audience joined in. A woman once scrambled through the ropes and bit Adrian 'Nature Boy' Street in the leg. </p> <p>Wrestling changed in the Eighties. Beef gave way to lard. Giant Haystacks was 6ft 9ins, weighed 39 stone and, recalled Mitchell, came out of his corner wearing only a napkin. Not a pretty sight, just listening to it turned my stomach. In the circs, I respect the then newly appointed head of ITV Sport's decision in 1988 to drop wrestling from the schedule because it was out of touch. It was a brave decision - I personally wouldn't care to antagonise anyone weighing 39 stone, wearing a napkin. Despite protests and threats to do him over, Greg Dyke stuck to his guns.

Was it coincidence that echoes of Spoonface Steinberg's piping little voice came to me as I listened to 13-year-old refugee Sia Mia's account of rape and murder at the hands of Sierra Leonean rebels? It was Lee Hall, author of Spoonface, who together with Kate Rowland, head of radio drama came up with the idea of dramatising the views of five real children from totally different backgrounds in Africa, Brazil, Lapland, Korea and finally Britain.

      "byline": "Peter Conrad",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The face which thrusts itself into your face when you meet Mark Morris is rather scary, especially if it's early in the morning. 'How insulting!' he shrieked when I commiserated with his bloodshot eyes. Then he checked them in a mirror and winced at the twin sunsets he saw. 'Ohmygod,' he wailed, 'that's the red wine.' </p> <p>He then retreated behind a pair of shades and further obfuscated himself in a cloud of fag smoke. His voice, thanks to the liquor and fumes, is a foghorn, but it booms from inside a body which is frisky and androgynous, despite his black stubble and marauding chest hair. Crossing his legs, he displayed a pair of lurid socks which seemed to go with the wine he'd been drinking and began to complain - or should I say bitch? - about the enforced trek from his West End hotel to rehearsals in north London. 'I'm stay ing in Leicester Square because it's near the Coliseum. Then they tell me the rehearsals are in Hampstead, and I'm like, \"Excuse me?\" It's far away and it's filthy dirty, and anyway I'm thirsty. No wonder I look a mess.' </p> <p>As he talked, Morris flapped the air with his hands and stirred up minor cyclones. Even when seated, he is - as befits a great choreographer and dancer - a whirling dervish. Yet whereas traditional ballet seeks to achieve lift-off, imitating the aerodynamism of angels, his style of dancing emphasises rootedness, earthy contact with the floor. At his beefiest, Morris resembles one of the pirouetting pachyderms in Fantasia . 'Big bottoms, large breasts - OK with me!' he once remarked in describing the approved physique for members of the Mark Morris Dance Group; their dances resound with the percussive din of bare feet stamping on the floorboards. </p> <p>Now at ENO, you can see the Maoist marches and ballroom tangos he choreographed for John Adams's opera Nixon in China , which inaugurates a virtual Morris season at the Coliseum. His exultant, pantheistic production of Handel's cantata L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, which in 1997 played to full houses, returns on 30 June; on 28 June, he pairs Purcell's Dido and Aeneas with a new production of Four Saints in Three Acts, a rarely seen mystical farrago with music by Virgil Thomson and a babbling, blissed-out text by Gertrude Stein. </p> <p>The Handel and Purcell productions date from Morris's residency at the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels a decade ago, when he outraged the Belgians. After being presented to Queen Fabiola, he reported: 'Best blowjob I ever had!' This did not deter him from describing Fabiola's helmet-like coiffure as 'a Maggie Thatcher hairdo of death'. </p> <p>Remembering his antics in Brussels, he told me: 'I was symbolic of something those people didn't like about each other.' It pleases Morris to think of himself as a nightmare, the energetic embodiment of everything abominated by the stiff, timid bourgeoisie. A nocturnal prowler, outfitted in black except for those red socks and his flaring eyes, he resembles Dracula in drag. His witchy malevolence and his slippery gift for commuting between genders will be displayed in the Purcell opera, in which, while the mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly sings from the pit, he dances both Dido and the Sorceress who plots her downfall. </p> <p>'I try to make them as different as possible, though they're opposites who are secretly alike. It's the hair thing that distinguishes them - up for Dido, down for the Sorceress.' He illustrated by imperiously flicking his mane, a raven's nest of entangled strands. </p> <p>This flouncing reminded me of the resemblance between Morris's Sorceress and two Hollywood bitch goddesses. 'Yeah, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis; those are fabulous actresses. And I also based her on Cruella de Vil. She's gleeful and vindictive, she has just the greatest time with her evil powers.' The Sorceress enjoys herself so much, in fact, that she visibly masturbates during her revels: Morris's female homage, perhaps, to the solitary climax which Nijinsky dramatised by grinding his hips on the scarf of the elusive nymph at the end of L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faun e. </p> <p>In Brussels, people also fussed when Morris's Dido had alfresco sex with the swarthy Aeneas of Guillermo Resto. 'Big deal,' he yawned. 'Dido and Aeneas fuck - why not? It's only showbiz. Everyone in the court is trying to per suade her to get back into dating; that's what it's about. So you see me come. But the sex scene is very formally choreographed, in an archaic style. Anyway, these days it's a middle-aged memory of lust; Guillermo and I are the two ancientest people in my company.' </p> <p>Morris used to insist on performing Purcell's brief opera on its own. 'It's a tragedy, with the comic witches in the middle of it. Why would you want anything else? Now we're doing it as a double-header. You see one piece, you have a drink - no, a couple of drinks - then you see another piece.' Dido will be preceded by Four Saints , which Morris has long wanted to stage. In doing so, he's aware of the need to combat the hyperbolic legend of the work's premiere. </p> <p>The first American production of Four Saints in Three Acts, at Hartford in 1934, made modernism chic. High society cherished the piece as a specimen of high camp and referred to the collaborators as Miss Thomson and Mr Stein. Though no one understood Stein's mystically inane libretto, her title became a commercial catch-phrase, and the window of Gimbels department store on Fifth Avenue soon advertised 'Four Suits in Two Acts'. </p> <p>The jazzy saints, who crooned and strutted in a cellophane heaven, were recruited in Harlem nightclubs. The choreographer, Frederick Ashton, conducted auditions horizontally; Thomson likewise, enthusing over the attributes of black performers, confessed: 'I went up to Harlem and I ended up with my end up in Harlem.' </p> <p>As Morris admits: 'A lotta people know about Four Saints just as an event. It was like the first night of The Rite of Spring - everyone in the world claimed that they were there, even though they weren't. But I want to get over all that, to make it new again. I always loved Stein's writing, though it's easy to make fun of. It's like your bookmark could be anywhere. You think duh, did I read this already? Not everyone gets what she does, but it provokes thought and produces pleasure. </p> <p>'Thomson, too, said that his music wasn't for everybody - it was for anybody. Nowadays, postminimalistically, the score sounds different. It's open but it's not empty. There's space in it. Sure, nothing happens. But what could happen? They're in heaven, right? So they're in rapture all the time. It's a festival, a festivity. And it's a fiesta, too. Teresa and Ignatius are Spanish saints; you can hear Spanish folk dances in the music, along with the gospel songs and fugueing tunes and protestant hymns.' </p> <p>The spirit of revelry - both carnal and spiritual, demonic and divine - is what animates Morris's best dances and explains their popularity. Dance, after all, is jubilant and, therefore, a mode of worship. 'I want the religion in Four Saints to be fun. Next spring, in a retrospective, we're going to pair it with my production of Handel's Dixit Dominus . The God in that is grim, relentless; it's not an easy one to watch. But Four Saints is about people in ecstasy, who just float off the ground. What I love is baroque religiosity. I went to an Orthodox wedding in Skopje. You stand around for hours and get high on incense, then everyone does fabulous dances and gets drunk. I thought, \"They sure know how to get married here!\" It's the same in India, where they have all these thousands of gods partying in the pantheon. How do they remember all their names?' </p> <p>When Morris mentioned India, I recalled a glimpse he'd once had of a woman who was the namesake of Stein's Teresa, and is touted by some as a candidate for sanctity. 'Sure, I went to Mother Teresa's outfit in Calcutta one evening. We sat on the floor with those fabulous sisters and shared their prayerbooks. But do I think she was a saint? No, I don't believe in any of that, though I'm happy if other people do. I'm faithless, but I believe in magic. For me, the weird thing was that the visit happened in the evening after I'd been at a temple dedicated to Kali, where I saw this really scary, violent ceremony.' </p> <p>The conjunction of opposites is typical of Morris, who discovers both Dido and the Sorceress within his polymorphous body. On an average day, he can divide himself between the charitable, celibate crone and the goddess festooned with blood-gorged penises; he attends a mass after witnessing an orgy. He is exuberant and thoughtful, like the schizoid temperaments contrasted in Handel's cantata, but never moderate. He is a force of nature, infectiously rampant.

      "bodyText": "The face which thrusts itself into your face when you meet Mark Morris is rather scary, especially if it's early in the morning. 'How insulting!' he shrieked when I commiserated with his bloodshot eyes. Then he checked them in a mirror and winced at the twin sunsets he saw. 'Ohmygod,' he wailed, 'that's the red wine.' He then retreated behind a pair of shades and further obfuscated himself in a cloud of fag smoke. His voice, thanks to the liquor and fumes, is a foghorn, but it booms from inside a body which is frisky and androgynous, despite his black stubble and marauding chest hair. Crossing his legs, he displayed a pair of lurid socks which seemed to go with the wine he'd been drinking and began to complain - or should I say bitch? - about the enforced trek from his West End hotel to rehearsals in north London. 'I'm stay ing in Leicester Square because it's near the Coliseum. Then they tell me the rehearsals are in Hampstead, and I'm like, \"Excuse me?\" It's far away and it's filthy dirty, and anyway I'm thirsty. No wonder I look a mess.' As he talked, Morris flapped the air with his hands and stirred up minor cyclones. Even when seated, he is - as befits a great choreographer and dancer - a whirling dervish. Yet whereas traditional ballet seeks to achieve lift-off, imitating the aerodynamism of angels, his style of dancing emphasises rootedness, earthy contact with the floor. At his beefiest, Morris resembles one of the pirouetting pachyderms in Fantasia . 'Big bottoms, large breasts - OK with me!' he once remarked in describing the approved physique for members of the Mark Morris Dance Group; their dances resound with the percussive din of bare feet stamping on the floorboards. Now at ENO, you can see the Maoist marches and ballroom tangos he choreographed for John Adams's opera Nixon in China , which inaugurates a virtual Morris season at the Coliseum. His exultant, pantheistic production of Handel's cantata L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, which in 1997 played to full houses, returns on 30 June; on 28 June, he pairs Purcell's Dido and Aeneas with a new production of Four Saints in Three Acts, a rarely seen mystical farrago with music by Virgil Thomson and a babbling, blissed-out text by Gertrude Stein. The Handel and Purcell productions date from Morris's residency at the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels a decade ago, when he outraged the Belgians. After being presented to Queen Fabiola, he reported: 'Best blowjob I ever had!' This did not deter him from describing Fabiola's helmet-like coiffure as 'a Maggie Thatcher hairdo of death'. Remembering his antics in Brussels, he told me: 'I was symbolic of something those people didn't like about each other.' It pleases Morris to think of himself as a nightmare, the energetic embodiment of everything abominated by the stiff, timid bourgeoisie.

It's also true that his ideas were blithely unprescriptive: museums can choose their own confectionery, hang those light-strings almost any way they like. Since there was no original, no intellectual copyright, the artist was always surprised that people didn't just buy some bulbs and make their own versions. </p> <p>But Felix Gonzalez-Torres was never a theorist. He loved minimalism - its elegant restraint, if not its austere detachment. </p> <p>Look at his lights and you see Dan Flavin's cool neon defrosted; every floor-piece of sparkling sweets winks playfully at Carl Andre.

But that's what you'd have to pay for three hours' work by a premier-league record spinner if you're promoting a night at one of the hipper clubs in town. The wages commanded by some of the stars behind the turntable decks have reached such dizzying proportions that one London promoter recently started a lobby to combat the inflation.</p> <p>As the members of this exclusive set fly over to Ibiza this week for the start of a lucrative summer playing dance records to barely-conscious ravers, it's time to blow the whistle on this most over-valued of modern occupations.</p> <p>First, let's be fair. It has not been an overnight success story, nor entirely undeserved: DJs have played an important part in the dissemination of black and popular music for years. They were crucial to the birth of rock'n'roll and hip hop. They furthered the cause of disco, where 'the mix' - the continuous flow of beats - moved the energy from the stage to the dancefloor.</p> <p>Some time in the Nineties, however, the DJ became deified. Hitherto invisible, he was moved into the spotlight. You can now see him on the sleeves of stylishly presented compilation or mix albums. The INCredible Sound Of... series put the likes of Trevor Nelson, Gilles Peterson and Jo Whiley on expensively packaged CDs.</p> <p>It was, of course, simply a response to the need for personalities, for 'faces'. The problem is that the issue of creative rights in dance music has become blurred in the process. The very name of the compilation The INCredible Sound Of... posits the DJ as creator.

But that's what you'd have to pay for three hours' work by a premier-league record spinner if you're promoting a night at one of the hipper clubs in town. The wages commanded by some of the stars behind the turntable decks have reached such dizzying proportions that one London promoter recently started a lobby to combat the inflation. As the members of this exclusive set fly over to Ibiza this week for the start of a lucrative summer playing dance records to barely-conscious ravers, it's time to blow the whistle on this most over-valued of modern occupations. First, let's be fair. It has not been an overnight success story, nor entirely undeserved: DJs have played an important part in the dissemination of black and popular music for years. They were crucial to the birth of rock'n'roll and hip hop. They furthered the cause of disco, where 'the mix' - the continuous flow of beats - moved the energy from the stage to the dancefloor. Some time in the Nineties, however, the DJ became deified. Hitherto invisible, he was moved into the spotlight. You can now see him on the sleeves of stylishly presented compilation or mix albums. The INCredible Sound Of... series put the likes of Trevor Nelson, Gilles Peterson and Jo Whiley on expensively packaged CDs. It was, of course, simply a response to the need for personalities, for 'faces'. The problem is that the issue of creative rights in dance music has become blurred in the process. The very name of the compilation The INCredible Sound Of... posits the DJ as creator. But whose music is it really? Who wrote it? Who made it? Trevor Nelson didn't, nor did Jo Whiley. Compiling and mixing a CD takes skill but it shouldn't be portrayed as a form of composition. Putting DJs on sleeves consolidates the overrated status they enjoy in clubs. A promoter told me: 'DJs have turned into the rock stars I hated in the first place.'

      "body": "<p>The great thing about the seven-minute walk from Bankside to St Paul's, across London's first new bridge in a century, as compared with a trip around the London Eye, say, is that you are actually going somewhere. The bridge offers a perspective of London just as astonishing in its way as the view from the London Eye. But at the end of the trip you don't have that slightly lame feeling of being right back where you started. </p> <p>The bridge has the effect not just of changing how a key part of the river looks, but also how it functions. For the first time it is possible to walk directly from the trading floors and the corporate headquarters of the north bank to the ducking- and-diving, south-of-the-river world of lock-up garages, council flats and railway arches that is still at the heart of Southwark, despite the epidemic of urban regeneration triggered by the Tate. </p> <p>Negotiating the bridge is also an intensely physical experience. Under a thundery gun-metal grey sky, there is the unmistakable gamey tang of low-tide London mud in the air. You can feel the beginnings of rain in the breeze, and the slight bouncing judder of aluminium underfoot. And of course there is a remarkable unfolding perspective of London as you move forward. </p> <p>Southwark's foreshore is one of the few vantage points from which it is possible to understand the pattern of London's growth and to get a sense of the city as a physical entity. You can see the mark left on London's topography by what, beneath all the reinforced concrete and plate glass, is visibly still the same marshy flood plain pockmarked with gravel banks that the legions of Emperor Claudius I encountered in AD43. From here you can read London's history, economic, and political, inscribed in the physical form of the city, like the rings of a tree. </p> <p>Despite such violent intrusions from the twentieth century as the instantly recognisable saw-toothed silhou- ettes of the Barbican's towers and the stainless steel rolling pin that was once the National Westminster Bank's high-rise headquarters, only the dome of St Paul's itself stands out, clearly defined against the skyline effortlessly crushing a riverfront scrum of buildings of bone-chilling mediocrity from the 1960s and 1970s. </p> <p>As you walk across, the viewpoint shifts, and the dome of the cathedral gets bigger and bigger, until you find yourself drawn into the north bank, where it appears almost vertically above you at the top of a river of stone steps. Stop midstream, and there is the remarkable sense of being afloat on a waterscape as if you were on a tightly rigged racing catamaran. The silence is in sharp contrast to the rumbling thunder of trains that made London's other pedestrian crossing, Hungerford Bridge, so daunting. </p> <p>The design is the product of an unusually diverse group of people. Norman Foster was the architect. Ove Arup were the engineers. But it was the sculptor Antony Caro who brought the team together to win the competition for the commission, beating among others, Frank Gehry and Richard Serra. They have created a bridge that is a beautiful object, lithe and delicate, but which still manages to acknowledge the magnitude of the task facing its builders. Spanning a fifth of a mile of water with just two supports is no party trick. But the bridge doesn't want to boast about it either. Rather than pumping up the structure like a bodybuilder on steroids, they have given the bridge muscles that ripple under the skin, like a sleek racehorse. </p> <p>Teamwork is one of those touchy-feely words that architects love to use, but which seldom describes the reality of warring egos, and competing claims for credit.

      "bodyText": "The great thing about the seven-minute walk from Bankside to St Paul's, across London's first new bridge in a century, as compared with a trip around the London Eye, say, is that you are actually going somewhere. The bridge offers a perspective of London just as astonishing in its way as the view from the London Eye. But at the end of the trip you don't have that slightly lame feeling of being right back where you started. The bridge has the effect not just of changing how a key part of the river looks, but also how it functions. For the first time it is possible to walk directly from the trading floors and the corporate headquarters of the north bank to the ducking- and-diving, south-of-the-river world of lock-up garages, council flats and railway arches that is still at the heart of Southwark, despite the epidemic of urban regeneration triggered by the Tate. Negotiating the bridge is also an intensely physical experience. Under a thundery gun-metal grey sky, there is the unmistakable gamey tang of low-tide London mud in the air. You can feel the beginnings of rain in the breeze, and the slight bouncing judder of aluminium underfoot. And of course there is a remarkable unfolding perspective of London as you move forward. Southwark's foreshore is one of the few vantage points from which it is possible to understand the pattern of London's growth and to get a sense of the city as a physical entity. You can see the mark left on London's topography by what, beneath all the reinforced concrete and plate glass, is visibly still the same marshy flood plain pockmarked with gravel banks that the legions of Emperor Claudius I encountered in AD43. From here you can read London's history, economic, and political, inscribed in the physical form of the city, like the rings of a tree. Despite such violent intrusions from the twentieth century as the instantly recognisable saw-toothed silhou- ettes of the Barbican's towers and the stainless steel rolling pin that was once the National Westminster Bank's high-rise headquarters, only the dome of St Paul's itself stands out, clearly defined against the skyline effortlessly crushing a riverfront scrum of buildings of bone-chilling mediocrity from the 1960s and 1970s. As you walk across, the viewpoint shifts, and the dome of the cathedral gets bigger and bigger, until you find yourself drawn into the north bank, where it appears almost vertically above you at the top of a river of stone steps. Stop midstream, and there is the remarkable sense of being afloat on a waterscape as if you were on a tightly rigged racing catamaran. The silence is in sharp contrast to the rumbling thunder of trains that made London's other pedestrian crossing, Hungerford Bridge, so daunting. The design is the product of an unusually diverse group of people. Norman Foster was the architect. Ove Arup were the engineers. But it was the sculptor Antony Caro who brought the team together to win the competition for the commission, beating among others, Frank Gehry and Richard Serra. They have created a bridge that is a beautiful object, lithe and delicate, but which still manages to acknowledge the magnitude of the task facing its builders. Spanning a fifth of a mile of water with just two supports is no party trick. But the bridge doesn't want to boast about it either. Rather than pumping up the structure like a bodybuilder on steroids, they have given the bridge muscles that ripple under the skin, like a sleek racehorse. Teamwork is one of those touchy-feely words that architects love to use, but which seldom describes the reality of warring egos, and competing claims for credit. For once it actually reflects what really happened. Without the engineers, the bridge would not stand up. Without the architects, there would never have been the manic attention to detail that treated the design of every bolt head and weld as a major architectural issue. Without Foster's design skill, and highly effective championing of the bridge against doubters it would never have been built. And without Caro? In its present form it's hard to see Caro's direct involvement, but without him it would have been an entirely different bridge. He remained fully involved, even when the original design, a project that would have had a much clearer Caro signature, was modified in response to the request from the competition judges for a less sculptural design. 'People ask me which part of the bridge is mine,' says Caro. 'And, of course, I can't point to any single aspect of it. But that isn't really the issue. The idea of a sculptor, an architect, and an engineer working together is what really makes this bridge different, and I was there when all the important decisions were made.

      "body": "<p>Around 3.20pm last Saturday, 10 people dropped their trousers in front of Buckingham Palace in protest at the British monarchy. They were hauled away by the police and the crowd broke up. But then a cameraman found a spot of brown liquid on his clothes. He wiped it off, looked at the sky. What kind of rain was this? He soon found his answer. Two men, both stripped to the waist, each flicking a bottle of either ketchup or soy sauce at the other, lurched into view giggling hysterically. They continued pelting each other, hitting onlookers indiscriminately, until eight bottles were empty, and their bodies were drenched in sauce. </p> <p>The performance complete, the two men reached into a plastic bag and started handing out leaflets describing the 'Naked Soy Sauce and Ketchup Fight At Buckingham Palace'. The leaflet invited 'all visitors... to participate' and then gave the names of the 'performers': Yuan Cai, 44, and Jian Jun Xi, 38, two former art students from north London. 'Long Live the People', it proclaimed in large print. The people looked on, bemused. </p> <p>To the crowd, Cai and Xi may have appeared familiar. Last October they found their performance art - or 'live art' as they prefer it to be known - all over the papers. One afternoon, the two Chinese artists discreetly joined a party of Japanese tourists who were weaving their way through the Tate Gallery towards Tracey Emin's latest work, My Bed - a dilapidated collection of skid-marked sheets, used condoms and vodka bottles strewn around a mattress. The two men sprang from the crowd, stripped down to their underpants and then began romping on the exhibit. A pillow fight ensued. They shouted something in Mandarin. Cai tried to put on a pair of underpants he found on the bed. Then the police arrived. The Tate declined to press charges. </p> <p>Cai and Xi are keen to harvest some artistic credibility from their new-found fame. Sitting in the WKD bar in Camden, they describe themselves as 'heroes... ahead of our time', searching for a 'new route' in art. Emin, however, says they are 'gimmicky', and wishes that the Tate, whose responsibility she considers it to look after her work, had had them charged. 'It was upsetting and disturbing - a criminal offence,' she said. 'I wouldn't go round to someone's house, smash up a coffee table and call that art. It's terrorism - like some failed artist threatening to jump off Waterloo bridge unless they're given a gallery.' </p> <p>Cai and Xi prove unfazed when I convey Emin's comments. 'She's the failed artist, struggling in the system to network with the right people and hang out with the critics. Tracey's been recruited to the London Mafia of artists - a gang who try to dominate the scene.' </p> <p>Cai and Xi first performed together at Cit\u00e9 des Arts in Paris, colluding in 1994 for the 'Shit a Day' piece, for which they defecated daily on to a plate, before sitting down to eat it. Another recent stunt was on 21 May, again at the Tate, when they made a contribution to Marcel Duchamp's seminal work, the Fountain, a factory-made urinal he chose to autograph in 1917 and call art. Cai and Xi urinated on it for over a minute, their contribution kept away from Duchamp's porcelain by the work's Perspex case. Some say they missed the point. </p> <p>The Tate are not amused with Cai and Xi, choosing only to fax a terse statement about their exploits. 'The pleasure of our visitors has twice been disrupted by two artists who have threatened works of art and our staff. Tate will be taking action to protect the interests of visitors, the safety of the works of art in the collection and its employees.' They declined to say what the action would be. </p> <p>Cai and Xi take their art very seriously, despite frequently collapsing into giggles when talking about it. I ask why they felt they had to add to Duchamp's work. 'The urinal is there - it's an invitation,' says Cai. 'As Duchamp said himself, it's the artist's choice. He chooses what is art. We just added to it.' </p> <p>Xi, the stockier and friendlier of the pair, jumps in. 'Modern British art is getting worse and worse. They haven't taken any risks. The mainstream are caught in a circle, and we are outside that circle - pissing in.' </p> <p>One might dismiss them as publicity-hungry charlatans, leeching off a renaissance in British art. But wasn't that renaissance built on sensation? Pickled sheep, elephant dung, tents filled with the names of the artist's ex-lovers - all grabbed the headlines with cynical ease. Cai and Xi have, for the majority of their works, relied on defacing or 'contributing to' the work of another artist. When we met last week, they told me how they intended to add to their canon. Yesterday, at the Institute for International Visual Arts in Hoxton, in front of the assembled luminaries of British art, Cai was supposed to lie down in the middle of the floor and make a crucifix pose. He would then invite Xi to be the first of the onlookers to urinate into his mouth. </p> <p>I ask them, three days before this event, if they worry that their coprophilia means they'll never be taken seriously. 'We are not ashamed, we have no roots. We can eat our shit in public,' insists Xi. 'We want to make people think. We are ahead of our time. Future generations will understand us.' I ask them what exactly the future generations will understand - what they are trying to say. 'The statement we're making is \"yes, this is a new possibility\",' explains Xi. </p> <p>These kind of exploits have been seen before, of course. In 1976 Carl Andre's bricks at the Tate were sprayed with blue food dye, by a man protesting against their purchase, and dye was added to Damien Hirst's sheep installation at the Serpentine in 1994. </p> <p>Minor works of vandalism - such as pencil scratching on paintings - were found by a recent survey of museums to be surprisingly common. But major attacks were a different matter: their perpetrators were mostly men who want publicity and make no attempt to escape from the scene of the crime. More than half such attackers have been detained under the Mental Health Act. It is thought that, for some, an attack on a piece of work is a substitute for an attack on a person. And one defence is common: the assailant is making a 'positive contribution' to the work. </p> <p>Cai and Xi do not seem in need of a sectioning order. They are two sane, talkative men, who live on Becks beer and cigarettes. Cai is a father of three, Xi is divorced. They grew up in China, under Mao's Cultural Revolution. Cai found himself in trouble at the age of 16. He had been listening to Simon and Garfunkel on the radio. A former member of the Maoist boy scouts, the Little Red Guards, he plotted to flee to Russia. His father, a state publisher, informed on him. Cai spent three years in jail, one of them doing hard labour. </p> <p>He and Xi met at art college in Nanjing. They married English nationals and got UK passports. Then they went to art school. 'At Chelsea and the Royal College of Art, I was in the same college as Tracey Emin and Dinos Chapman,' says Cai. 'They were both doing boring pictures of squares and flowers - no skill at all.' Xi graduated from Goldsmith's. </p> <p>In 1996 they joined forces again for a piece called 'New Directions' in the Venice Biennale, in which they erected 125 misleading road signs, suggesting for example that there was a toilet down a street where there wasn't one. The next year, they graced the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford: Xi lay on the floor, and Cai drew a white line around his body, as though it were a murder scene. Recently they have lived off various commissions, one for a festival of Chinese art funded partly by the Arts Council. In 1998 Xi attempted a piece called 'Week Of Suffering'. He stuck chillies up his nose and mouth, lay with a raw fish down his throat and rammed a marrow in his mouth. Someone took pictures - these are an essential part of the piece. Then came Emin's bed, and stardom. </p> <p>'Since we jumped on the bed we see so many possibilities,' says Cai. 'We are determined to make a new way of looking at art. No artist can take the risks we do or have our ideas.' Again, I ask what their 'new way' is. The response - from Xi - is incomplete. 'It's action, direct action. We are also anti-class system,' he says. 'We want people to think that our work has political elements.' Elements that say what? What is the message? 'Look at this!' he says, raising his hands to an imaginary work of art. 'That is the message.' We agree to meet again the following day to give them more time to formulate a proper answer. </p> <p>The next day Cai complains of a troubled sleep. They haven't been able to find an answer to the question - what are they trying to say? They can say, however, that they want to 'make people happy' and bring attention to art and society. They have big plans for July and have targeted some unlikely sponsors for a new piece. They intend to ask a restaurant - the New Cultural Revolution, in Camden, north London - to collect the faeces of a week's customers. Cai and Xi will smear themselves in it and then go to the Tate, where they will walk around the exhibits discussing the works and recording their conversation. The owner of The New Cultural Revolution has yet to hear of their plans. </p> <p>After this, they intend to go one stage further. Chairman Mao, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, swam the Yangtse River to prove his physical fitness. Once they leave the Tate, Cai and Xi will swim across the Thames. The river police put their chances of survival as 'slim'. Still, at least they won't have to wash those trousers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here are some examples of 'difficult' ages: 0-three months (anarchy); eight months ('separation anxiety'); two ('terrible'); 13-18 (adolescence); 30 (unwelcome end to youth); 40 onwards (midlife crisis); old age (no gloss needed). We are all 'going through a stage'. We are - most of us - at a 'difficult age'. </p> <p>But what's age got to do with it, as Tina Turner almost sang (as the greatest age-defier in the pop world, she should have done). We all defer to age. We look at each new decade as if it were an augury, a predictor of our state of mind. We expect age to be a symbolic key, but it cannot tell us much. If anything, it is like one of those gold-coated plastic keys that used to be stuck on twenty-first birthday cards. It is not reliable. And, like those birthday keys, it cannot open any real doors. </p> <p>I asked my grandmother one day (I was seven) while we were picking lavender, how old she was. There was a pause. 'Ninety-nine,' she replied tartly. There was no mistaking the rebuke. Age evidently was a subject to be tidied away, like the lavender we would later tuck into muslin bags. I was put out that she did not want to answer my question. I was hurt to be thought tactless and felt cheated by her lie. For children, 'How old are you?' is the first and most important question to settle. </p> <p>As a child, you boast about your age; later, you may lie about it. For a child, each new year is a higher score. And then suddenly you want to shout 'stop!' My mother-in-law advises me to 'stay 39' but I've let things slide. I am 42. For many people, their twenties are the most unhappy time of their lives - partly because they are not advertised as 'difficult'. In the same way that parties are often disagreeable because you are obliged to look as though you are having a good time, it can be a strain being in your twenties. I am all for an official 'terrible twenties' label. </p> <p>I have often wondered whether I might have a midlife crisis. The idea of reinventing yourself is always attractive. And this week I have had a guide to hand: Martin Amis's autobiography (curious that even his initials should stand for middle age). Oddly, I had been pondering the implicit expectation in the book that the forties almost routinely bring turmoil in their wake when something happened to suggest that the reverse might be true. Perhaps, like all age clich\u00e9s, this one needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Midlife crises may not be all they are cracked up to be. </p> <p>I was on a mission to buy my stepson a belt. He is 12 (a difficult age). He and his 14-year-old brother are converts to the charm of heavy metal (music and props). I'd been given some hints (more rumour than precise instruction) from my stepson about where to go and presently found myself in Camden Town in north London. The market has been a favourite haunt of adolescents for decades. It is crowded, seedy, trendy and inexpensive. I wound in and out of shops before fetching up outside one I was not quite sure about entering. At the door was an assistant in black leather, dripping with chains who looked like a bouncer and was pierced in many places like an abortive stapling experiment. </p> <p>I stepped inside the shop which was dark, small and malodorous. It smelt of leather and of something else, more unsavoury, harder to identify. A pale girl with hair like turquoise cotton wool stared at me over a bank of silver jewellery. Studded belts hung from the walls like whips or nooses and an atmosphere of passive violence obtained. In the corner a fat, swarthy man, who was almost as old as me, skulked. </p> <p>I felt intensely self-conscious. My clothes were wrong: my rusty linen suit, my stone-grey, tailored jacket, my middle-aged face and middle-class voice. I was an alien and the assistant evidently thought so too. He was breathing down my neck, as if he didn't trust me at all. I stared at studded chokers in mauve, scarlet and fake zebra skin. What I wanted, I ventured uncertainly, was a belt to go round the waist. 'Most belts do,' he said in an unfriendly way. I had been feeling small, now I felt invisible. 'I don't know where any of these things are supposed to go,' I protested weakly. And it was at this point that he produced the belt. </p> <p>It was composed entirely of silver bullets, hanging like fierce pods in a row and all strapped together with rubber. It was a ludicrously macho, violent yet original item, unlike anything else in the shop. One of the bullets had been painted a lethal scarlet. It weighed a ton. And even the smart-alec assistant was none too clear about how to get the damned belt round his waist. He wrestled with it for some time before getting the better of it. It was costly and frightening - too frightening to turn down. 'I'll take it,' I whispered. </p> <p>The man in the corner stepped forward, the manager as it turned out. He looked me up and down dismissively. 'Come with me,' he said, 'I have the perfect trousers for you. Upstairs.' 'No,' I said, with effort. 'I have quite enough trousers already. I am happy with my trousers.' I headed for the street. </p> <p>At the time, in the shop, I thought this is what it means to be middle aged. But now I see that what I was feeling was nothing of the kind. It was a flashback to being 14: self-conscious, hoping I looked right, hoping not to be too ridiculous, hoping I might have chosen the right belt. </p> <p>Nothing has changed. That 14-year-old is still inside but must not be let out again on any account. 'You're as young as you feel,' the clich\u00e9 goes. Well, thank God it isn't always true. I suddenly saw what is seldom acknowledged, that middle age is not a crisis but an oasis: the relief, the joy of not being 14 any more! </p> <p>But never let on that you know what it is to be anything other than middle-aged. I must find my equivalent of the bullet belt, and belt up. I know because I once enthusiastically volunteered at supper time that, as a teenager, I too had been a regular in Camden Town, down at the market. And I was well into describing the furs, the battered army coats, the cracked leather jackets, the second-hand granny dresses, before I looked up and saw my stepson's face registering polite incredulity and an alarmed disinclination to hear more. So even though you recognise that history is repeating itself in front of your own eyes (adolescence has no new lines), it will not do to say: 'I felt the same at your age.' Or, even worse: 'I felt the same last week.' Teenagers need to feel different from middle-aged people, especially their parents. </p> <p>Having said that, I can't help wondering whether I might not go back to the shop and ask just to see those trousers.</p>",

He is 12 (a difficult age). He and his 14-year-old brother are converts to the charm of heavy metal (music and props). I'd been given some hints (more rumour than precise instruction) from my stepson about where to go and presently found myself in Camden Town in north London. The market has been a favourite haunt of adolescents for decades. It is crowded, seedy, trendy and inexpensive. I wound in and out of shops before fetching up outside one I was not quite sure about entering. At the door was an assistant in black leather, dripping with chains who looked like a bouncer and was pierced in many places like an abortive stapling experiment. I stepped inside the shop which was dark, small and malodorous. It smelt of leather and of something else, more unsavoury, harder to identify. A pale girl with hair like turquoise cotton wool stared at me over a bank of silver jewellery. Studded belts hung from the walls like whips or nooses and an atmosphere of passive violence obtained. In the corner a fat, swarthy man, who was almost as old as me, skulked. I felt intensely self-conscious. My clothes were wrong: my rusty linen suit, my stone-grey, tailored jacket, my middle-aged face and middle-class voice. I was an alien and the assistant evidently thought so too. He was breathing down my neck, as if he didn't trust me at all. I stared at studded chokers in mauve, scarlet and fake zebra skin. What I wanted, I ventured uncertainly, was a belt to go round the waist. 'Most belts do,' he said in an unfriendly way. I had been feeling small, now I felt invisible. 'I don't know where any of these things are supposed to go,' I protested weakly. And it was at this point that he produced the belt. It was composed entirely of silver bullets, hanging like fierce pods in a row and all strapped together with rubber. It was a ludicrously macho, violent yet original item, unlike anything else in the shop. One of the bullets had been painted a lethal scarlet. It weighed a ton. And even the smart-alec assistant was none too clear about how to get the damned belt round his waist. He wrestled with it for some time before getting the better of it. It was costly and frightening - too frightening to turn down. 'I'll take it,' I whispered. The man in the corner stepped forward, the manager as it turned out. He looked me up and down dismissively. 'Come with me,' he said, 'I have the perfect trousers for you. Upstairs.' 'No,' I said, with effort. 'I have quite enough trousers already. I am happy with my trousers.' I headed for the street. At the time, in the shop, I thought this is what it means to be middle aged. But now I see that what I was feeling was nothing of the kind. It was a flashback to being 14: self-conscious, hoping I looked right, hoping not to be too ridiculous, hoping I might have chosen the right belt. Nothing has changed. That 14-year-old is still inside but must not be let out again on any account. 'You're as young as you feel,' the clich\u00e9 goes. Well, thank God it isn't always true. I suddenly saw what is seldom acknowledged, that middle age is not a crisis but an oasis: the relief, the joy of not being 14 any more! But never let on that you know what it is to be anything other than middle-aged. I must find my equivalent of the bullet belt, and belt up. I know because I once enthusiastically volunteered at supper time that, as a teenager, I too had been a regular in Camden Town, down at the market. And I was well into describing the furs, the battered army coats, the cracked leather jackets, the second-hand granny dresses, before I looked up and saw my stepson's face registering polite incredulity and an alarmed disinclination to hear more. So even though you recognise that history is repeating itself in front of your own eyes (adolescence has no new lines), it will not do to say: 'I felt the same at your age.' Or, even worse: 'I felt the same last week.' Teenagers need to feel different from middle-aged people, especially their parents. Having said that, I can't help wondering whether I might not go back to the shop and ask just to see those trousers.",

      "body": "<p>Is this a Frasier I see before me? No, it's the classically-trained actor Kelsey Grammer, who just happens to have found fame and fortune as TV's Dr Frasier Crane, strutting the Shakespearean stuff he has loved since childhood. During Frasier 's summer break, Grammer could be forgiven for lolling beside his LA pool like any other superstar, counting his money in the sun. Instead, he has chosen to take a chance on Broadway, braving one of the stage's ultimate dares: Macbeth. </p> <p>Thanks to Cheers and Frasier, Grammer is the most successful star in the history of US television, now enjoying an unrivalled eighteenth year in the top 10 ratings, and said to earn seven figures per half-hour episode. So why is he putting himself through this? 'I know, we never learn, do we?' he shrugs with a wan grin at Sardi's, Broadway's favourite watering-hole. 'It may sound corny, but the stage is my first love. It's where I started out. In television, you lose that intimate contact with the audience. If I don't go back to live theatre every few years, I begin to feel... rusted.' </p> <p>It is 24 hours before Macbeth 's first public preview and a week till opening night. The critics, he thinks, will be out to get him on Thursday, even before they file into the Music Box Theater. 'Oh sure, even when it was first announced, they started yelling What? Frasier playing Macbeth? That guy?' It is only thanks to Grammer's grace under such pressure, both onstage and off, that the production has made it this far. It's been a long, hard road to the Great White Way. </p> <p>Clowns proverbially want to play Hamlet. But 45-year-old Grammer is no mere clown, more a gifted and versatile actor who has tackled plenty of Shakespeare since his student days at New York's Julliard School, and in rep before 'lapsing' into TV. He has played Richard II and supporting roles in Hamlet and Othello . But he's been haunted by Shakespeare's murderous thane for 20 years, since fate propelled him into the title role as a 25-year-old Broadway understudy. 'I wasn't very good,' he recalls matter-of-factly. 'I was too young.' Back in 1980 noted thesp Philip Anglim pulled out because, to Grammer's tactful memory, 'he got sick'. Broadway veterans recall that it was more to do with 'lousy reviews'. Which makes the progress of Grammer's latest Macbeth from New England to New York all the braver. For last month's notices of his Boston try-out were worse than he feared. </p> <p>'You can take the boy out of Frasier , but you can't quite take Frasier out of the boy,' wrote Ed Siegel of the Boston Globe . Grammer's Macbeth was 'capable and often daring' but 'rarely distinguished'. The Boston Herald pinned the blame for 'this mess' on its British director, Terry Hands, he of 25 years with the Royal Shakespeare Company. To the Herald 's Terry Byrne, Hands had 'no respect for the text'. Grammer's performance offered 'absolutely no insight' into the character. William K. Gale of the Providence Journal-Bulletin proved a lone voice in the critical wilderness: 'How is Kelsey Grammer? Well, he's pretty darn good.' </p> <p>Backstage in Boston, despite packed houses and standing ovations, crisis duly loomed. For a few days, the show's future teetered as the producers considered pulling the plug and Grammer pondered the wisdom of braving New York's notoriously hard-to-please critics. Maybe, for all the advance hype - whole page ads in the New York Times, Frasier's sonorous voice repeatedly telling upscale radio listeners just how 'complex... driven... dark' Macbeth is - the men in suits would chicken out and cancel the Broadway transfer. </p> <p>So it was to a tense Colonial Theater in Boston, right around the corner from the Cheers bar where Grammer first made Frasier's name, that I hied me 10 days ago to judge for myself. As a devout Frasier fan, I wanted to catch what might prove my only chance to see a production surely destined for legendary status, whether as triumph or disaster, even as legendary, perhaps, as Peter O'Toole's 'tomato ketchup' Macbeth at the Old Vic in 1980. So did Macbeth's 'vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself', apply to Frasier's attempt to play Shakespeare's 'butcher' king? No, not at all. I wound up agreeing with Mr Gale: Kelsey Grammer's Macbeth was pretty darn good. </p> <p>OK, Laurence Olivier he ain't. More Kenneth Branagh, thoroughly convincing and excellent in parts without leaving all that much etched on your soul. But there were certainly those vital benchmarks by which an accomplished actor makes so huge a part his own. </p> <p>A naturally introspective stage presence, Grammer can be sinister at unexpected moments; by the wily way he asks Banquo: 'Is't far you ride?', you know just what's on his dastardly mind. He speaks the verse well, is spot-on with the rhythms and emphases of the big soliloquies, and grows persuasively deranged as he progresses from warrior-hero to murderous tyrant to fatalistic corpse-in-waiting. </p> <p>Macbeth's confrontation with Banquo's Ghost (unseen in this production by the audience) is particularly effective. With only a handful of guests at the vast table to point up the tyrant's growing isolation, Hands craftily places Lady Macbeth (the excellent Diane Venora) in the empty seat, so that her husband winds up nearly throttling her. As his comeuppance nears, at the hands of the feistiest Macduff I have ever seen (Bruce A. Young), his eyes go Archie Rice-dead as the news of his wife's death has him tomorrowing toward all our yesterdays. </p> <p>Because we already warm to Grammer via Frasier as a genial, vulnerable if uptight sort of guy, the thane we first meet really is 'too full of the milk of human kindness' to proceed all that blithely with the murder of Duncan. But there are fewer pros than cons to Grammer's celebrated alter ego. An undeniable (and seemingly unavoidable) problem arises when an actor with such familiar comic body language decides to go legit. Grammer's natural walk, for instance, is a laborious sub-Groucho Marx waddle, all splayed feet and bent knees, neck bobbing like a chicken's. It works to great effect in Frasier , when he lopes across the room to tackle some passing crisis, but proves less apt when his Macbeth is required to stride off one side of the stage while, in true RSC fashion, the next scene is already under way on the other. But you can't do much about that, I told Hands down the phone to Wales, where he was taking a break between Boston and Broadway to deal with a crisis of his own at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which he now runs. 'Oh yes, I can. What else?' So I told him about the bouncing eyebrows. To my surprise (and horror), Hands relayed this to Grammer, who apparently 'cracked up' when I was quoted as calling the production 'too RSC'. </p> <p>More phone calls followed. By the time both men arrived in New York last week, Grammer having persuaded the producers that, to hell with the critics, the show must go on, I almost felt part of the production team. By Thursday night's dress rehearsal, I was backstage at the Music Box as Hands tried to erase the last vestiges of Grammer's Frasier from Grammer's Macbeth in time for the first preview. </p> <p>The new-grown beard helps, and the smaller theatre offers a better focus for Grammer's resonant voice and Hands's cleverly orchestrated shafts of light amid the claustrophobic darkness. But that measured Frasier tread... it even sparked recognition in the eyes of passers-by as Grammer, otherwise anonymous behind his shades, plodded across West 44th Street from Sardi's to the theatre. </p> <p>'I hope I've shed Frasier's mannerisms,' he told me. 'I really don't want his nervous tics coming along for the ride. It's the same voice, of course, but I use it quite differently. As for the walk... ' A shrug, and he waddled off to don his make-up. </p> <p>Hands is cunning enough to hide Grammer's famous face behind an elaborate helmet on his first entrance, denying audiences their chance to applaud this stellar Macbeth before he has opened his mouth. Well, this is America, where Shakespeare gets a brief programme note plus credits as 'playwright', alongside a synopsis of the play which does not shrink from giving away the ending. </p> <p>New York audiences will no doubt compensate, as did Boston's, with a thunderous standing ovation at the end. But are catharsised Frasier fans applauding Kelsey Grammer or Frasier Crane, or Grammer's Frasier, or Frasier's Macbeth, or even Grammer's Frasier's Macbeth? It was the question which dared not speak its many names as I tried to avoid putting Grammer off his Shakespearean stride. </p> <p>So I asked it anyway. 'Look,' he sighed with an authentic Frasier grimace, 'Frasier's a breeze compared with this. I think the real point is that stage acting is quite different from small-screen work. You use the same techniques and skills, but in a much larger way. And Shakespeare, of course, makes for a different kind of theatre. Here in America, there's a built-in reverence - this is distant, this is grand. People don't expect a production to be urgent, gripping, as I hope this one is. But I've noticed, after a tuning-in period of 10 minutes or so, that they're on the edge of their seats. A lot of them, I'm delighted to say, are people who've never been to Shakespeare before.' </p> <p> En route to this 'major moment' in his career, Grammer has lived through serial drama and tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Born in the US Virgin Islands, he was 12 when his father was shot dead, by a man subsequently acquitted on grounds of insanity. Eight years later, his sister was abducted, raped and murdered in Colorado. Five years after that, his two half-brothers died when attacked by sharks while scuba diving. </p> <p>Small wonder, perhaps, that Grammer found solace in drink and drugs. Busted for drunk-driving and cocaine possession, then rearrested for violating his probation, he served 30 days in jail, flipped his car again and finally checked himself into the Betty Ford Clinic in 1990. When his second marriage collapsed amid it all, his wife suffered a miscarriage while attempting suicide, then told all to tabloid TV. </p> <p>Shakespeare, he says, helped him through all this. At 13, traumatised by the death of his grandfather (of natural causes) so soon after his father's murder, he was introduced by a 'wonderful' teacher to Stoicism as exemplified by Brutus in Julius Caesar. 'I had already been turned on by Shakespeare's language as young as 10.' From Brutus, he learned that 'we can maintain an essential dignity while not allowing our emotions to rule our lives'. He had found 'a refuge' in Shakespeare and 'a passion for his language'. </p> <p>Third time around, he has now found teetotal happiness in marriage to a former MTV dancer, Camille Donatacci. A visit to their website (<a href=\"http://www.kelseylive.com\">www.kelseylive.com</a>) reveals that their surrogate (as yet) children are two Basenji dogs named Little Red and Prince Bakuma Zen Koji. Grammer posts his views on subjects ranging from alcoholism to the bombing of Iraq and the impeachment of Clinton ('I wish that whatever occurred in the Oval Office had never taken place'). He videotapes monthly greetings to his fans, answering their painfully predictable questions with infinite patience. Post-tax profits from the site are devoted to worthy causes supported by his charitable foundation. </p> <p>Does he find himself drawing on his own tragedies when squaring up to a role like Macbeth? 'No, I'd rather not. I managed to play Laertes without having to think of my own dead sister to grieve for his. Because I'm on TV, almost everything I do seems to have huge consequences, whether I like it or not. You could say the same of Macbeth. But any incidents that may have occurred in my own life are never as interesting as what's in the play. If something from the past passes through my mind on a particular evening, though, then that performance can take right off.' </p> <p>Hands considers Grammer's Macbeth 'outstanding - quite worthy of Stratford'. When I suggest casting him next as Iago, to Bruce Young's Othello, he agrees: 'Nice idea. But you know who I actually see Kelsey as, milking both his comic skills and his dramatic power? Richard III.' </p> <p>The dress rehearsal is done, the walk straightened out and the box office is doing booming business. Tomorrow, the punters will start arriving, followed on Thursday by the critics. Is Grammer superstitious? 'No. I don't have a problem saying the name of my part backstage.' But will the jinx on the 'Scottish play' strike yet again this week, in the shape of the New York critics' make-or-break reviews? 'Life,' groans Grammer, 'is designed to be tough.' </p> <p>Whatever the critics say, summer audiences on Broadway seem likely to follow Boston's lead in taking no notice and plonking sell-out bums on seats. Fail? Frasier fail? Kelsey Grammer has screwed his courage to the sticking-place and does not deserve to fail.</p>",

Kelsey Grammer has screwed his courage to the sticking-place and does not deserve to fail.",

Labels die hard. </p> <p>Fortunately for Christianity, or at any rate most people's perception of Christianity, there is now a new, improved - dare one say cool - way to salvation which is simultaneously solving the perennial 'more-bums-on-pews' dilemma. It's called Alpha. In its present form (it originated in the late Seventies but was updated 10 years ago) Alpha has successfully rebranded Christianity to appeal to people, mainly young people - the average age of those who have taken an Alpha course is 27 - who would rather be crucified than wear sandals. Muscular Christianity these days refers to New Age Christians who belong to a gym. </p> <p>Charlotte Bromley Davenport, aged 25, public school and university educated, did the Alpha course in January. She is tall, slim, bright, friendly, funny, beautiful, talks about films, fashions and boyfriends and works as a photographer for Vogue . She now runs a group specifically geared to take Alpha into prisons. She is a totally committed Christian but at the same time completely relaxed about her faith. </p> <p>'If it comes up in conversation, of course I'll talk about it but I don't bang on about it.' Her friends include converts and non-believers. She recently dumped a boyfriend after much agonising because he was a committed atheist but is that so different from a twitcher dumping a self-confessed pigeon strangler? Is the Alpha course at all similar to Billy Graham's way of teaching? 'Who is Billy Graham?' asked Charlotte. </p> <p>Seven thousand churches in Britain, 15,000 worldwide, covering every Chris tian denomination from lowest Baptist to highest Catholic run the Alpha course. So do 80 of our 170 universities and colleges and 120 out of 158 prisons. When the Reverend Sandy Miller, rector of Holy Trinity, Brompton in Knightsbridge first thought of running the course Alpha was designed for regular churchgoers. It was his curate Nicky Gumbel, a barrister by training, who turned it into a sort of beginners' guide to Christianity for non-believers, or at least people who when filling in forms automatically put C of E in the religious box without knowing why. </p> <p>At 63, Sandy Miller says he belongs to a generation who went to church but never thought to question their religion. It was something you were taught at school, like Latin. Today's sceptical, streetwise younger generation are curious. They won't be fobbed off with cant; they want explanations, answers, inspiration. A 10-week Alpha course including a couple of voluntary residential prayer weekends provides them with all of these. </p> <p>The 900 or so students arriving at Holy Trinity, Brompton, just around the corner from Harrods, for the fifth lecture in the current series 'Why do we pray and how do we pray?' last Wednesday night did not look like your stereotype happy-clappy. The sessions started at seven and many of them had clearly come straight from work, young men still making deals on their mobiles as they turned into the tree-lined lane that leads to HTB, girls in sleek designer suits and high heels carrying briefcases. Overheard snatch of conversation: 'Are you going to Archie's do tomorrow night?' 'Yes, but later - I've got a presentation at six and t'ai chi at eight.' The atmosphere inside the church falls somewhere between school assembly and a cocktail party except that there's no alcohol and no one is trying to look obviously cool. Everyone looks happy, friendly and alert, unlike the disciples at the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh's ashram in Poona where everyone looks happy, friendly and stoned. There's a queue for supper - \u00a32.50, shepherd's pie and coleslaw on paper plates and juice in plastic cups. 'For Christssake Kev watch me head with that frigging pole,' says a bearded man in jeans. Illusions shattered? No, it's someone from the television crew here to film the evening for a future David Frost special. There are cables everywhere and a huge screen to the right of the altar. Before Nicky Gumbel starts the official lecture, he apologises for the intrusion but there's no point in denying that publicity is important. This is only a rehearsal. The real filming is next week. People who don't want to be filmed should arrive early and stand in the left-hand supper queue. The cameramen have had strict instructions. Banalities over we are invited to stand and sing along to a guitar played by a young man with a voice like Mark Knopfler. </p> <p>As a speaker, Gumbel sounds disconcertingly like Tony Blair - same boyish sincerity, same halting but heartfelt delivery. He prays, he tells us because it is the way, the only way to have a relationship with God. And because it's effective. He keeps a prayer diary and ticks those prayers that have been answered. There are a lot of ticks. Sometimes his prayers are not answered. There was the time he was playing tennis with a friend, who suddenly collapsed on court with a heart attack. All night Gumbel prayed for his friend's recovery. Why God, why, he asked miserably, furiously in the morning, did you let a happily married man with a loving wife and six children die? He realised he had a choice. He could either stop believing in God or accept the mystery of the Almighty and carry on praying. He stayed with the mystery. </p> <p>By the way, had we heard the story about the atheist who fell of a cliff, clutched at a tuft of grass and cried: 'Oh God, if you really are up there help me'? 'Let go of the tuft of grass,' boomed a voice from above. The atheist hesitated for a moment then said: 'Is there anyone else up there?' </p> <p>Gumbel's combination of humour, anecdote, metaphysics, quotations from the bible and complex theology are both persuasive and compelling. On the form that they are invited to complete when they finish the Alpha course, students are asked 'would you have described yourself as a Christian before you took the Alpha course?' Most of them write 'sort of' or 'more or less' or 'Christian-ish'. And would they describe themselves as Christians now? Most of them write yes. </p> <p>Was there a specific moment during Charlotte's journey to Christianity when she knew that she had seen the light? Oh yes, said the girl who shunned religious groups at university because she wanted to do normal things like go clubbing and get pissed. It was at a Pontin's holiday camp in Chichester, West Sussex's answer to Damascus, that the group had taken over for their residential weekend. 'They were talking about the Holy Ghost and I suddenly felt all shivery and then gradually felt myself becoming filled with love and peace.' She said it matter of factly as if she were describing flu symptoms. </p> <p>It's first their normality then their niceness that distinguishes young New Age Christians from the weirdo born-again Cliff Richard brigade. Their agnostic contemporaries don't consider them odd. 'If the rest of us are bitching about someone, the Christians will probably stand up for them, they are really nice that way,' said Gary Matthewman, second-year piano student at the Royal College of Music, which has its fair share of Alpha converts. 'They may not get as drunk as we do and they go to bed earlier but there's nothing weird about them. They are ordinary violinists and saxophonists and pianists who happen to believe in God.' </p> <p>What was it that finally decided Charlotte to take the Alpha course? 'I suppose I was fed up with all the crap, the posing, the image obsession. That probably sounds strange coming from someone whose job is all about image but that's strictly work. This is different.

      "body": "<p>I have no doubt that Observer readers are the type who listened in Spanish classes. So you all know how to pronounce this little baby. Say-at Lay-on. Not Seet Ly-own, as a mate of mine had it when it first arrived, which sounds like a sofa covered in animal hide. Still, such a flashy piece of furniture would, no doubt, meet the approval of a Seat Leon owner. Despite multiple protestations in the PR literature ('These are not cars aimed at the boy racer'), the Leon - especially the top-of- the-range Sport and Cupra - has a whiff of the wide boy about it.</p> <p>Which is more than fine by me. Wide boys and women have been the driving force (sorry) behind most of the last decade's motoring innovations. When women started getting behind their own wheel (as opposed to behind the wheel of their husband's motor), a whole new category of car came on the scene: the rinky-dink safe-as-you-like supermini - the Twingo, Ka, Micra, Yaris, Matiz, Lupo. And when more and more wide boys were pulling doughnuts in lowered Ford Escorts and tweaking the engines of their Novas and Renault 5s, the manufacturers eventually had to respond. Now, most mid-range cars have a sport version that's aimed more at the Max Power reader than it is at the peruser of Middle-Management Weekly .</p> <p>The Seat Leon combines the best of the women's cars (safety, VFM, styling) with the wide boys' (pizzazz, driving ability, styling). Its generously equipped entry version - anti-lock brakes, four air bags - costs just \u00a310,995. The 20V T Sport is under \u00a316,000, and that has air-con and six gears. Once you get to the SE, the Sport and the Cupra models, lowered suspension is standard. And, aside from satisfying the ladies and the lads, all this is offered in a vehicle that appeals to the Beemer or VW owner.

      "bodyText": "I have no doubt that Observer readers are the type who listened in Spanish classes. So you all know how to pronounce this little baby. Say-at Lay-on. Not Seet Ly-own, as a mate of mine had it when it first arrived, which sounds like a sofa covered in animal hide. Still, such a flashy piece of furniture would, no doubt, meet the approval of a Seat Leon owner. Despite multiple protestations in the PR literature ('These are not cars aimed at the boy racer'), the Leon - especially the top-of- the-range Sport and Cupra - has a whiff of the wide boy about it. Which is more than fine by me. Wide boys and women have been the driving force (sorry) behind most of the last decade's motoring innovations. When women started getting behind their own wheel (as opposed to behind the wheel of their husband's motor), a whole new category of car came on the scene: the rinky-dink safe-as-you-like supermini - the Twingo, Ka, Micra, Yaris, Matiz, Lupo. And when more and more wide boys were pulling doughnuts in lowered Ford Escorts and tweaking the engines of their Novas and Renault 5s, the manufacturers eventually had to respond. Now, most mid-range cars have a sport version that's aimed more at the Max Power reader than it is at the peruser of Middle-Management Weekly . The Seat Leon combines the best of the women's cars (safety, VFM, styling) with the wide boys' (pizzazz, driving ability, styling). Its generously equipped entry version - anti-lock brakes, four air bags - costs just \u00a310,995. The 20V T Sport is under \u00a316,000, and that has air-con and six gears. Once you get to the SE, the Sport and the Cupra models, lowered suspension is standard. And, aside from satisfying the ladies and the lads, all this is offered in a vehicle that appeals to the Beemer or VW owner. Meaning, it has a more grown-up status. All in all, it's a pretty package. Especially when, as my 20V T Sport did, it comes in bright yellow. The door handles matched (all versions are five-door) and blended into the banana-mobile.

      "body": "<p>Underneath our ribs lies the largest and one of the most vital of our organs: the liver. The liver performs many important functions relating to the blood, manufacturing substances that enable the blood to clot effectively, as well as others that regulate the digestion, absorption and storage of nutrients, such as vitamins A, B, K and folate. It also converts vitamin D into its most useful form for our bodies, which has implications for calcium's bone-maintaining functions.</p> <p>People often first become aware of their livers when they receive abnormal results from a routine blood test and are informed that they have raised levels of liver enzymes. The presence of abnormally high levels of such enzymes as gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GT) or alkaline phosphatase in the blood suggests that the liver is working at a reduced capacity and is struggling to perform its essential duties. Because raised levels of liver enzymes can occur for many reasons, your doctor will need to investigate further to ascertain whether they have been caused by the hepatitis virus, the side effects of certain drugs - perhaps strong anti-inflammatories - or, in rare cases, a cancerous tumour. In the majority of cases, however, there is no underlying cause except for your liver's inability to cope with your eating and drinking habits. In such instances, regard high enzyme levels as a warning that you must start looking after your liver.</p> <p>Because the liver is the organ that primarily filters, digests and metabolises food, what we eat and the liquids we drink have a huge impact on its health. Everything that you swallow is metabolised by the liver, so I don't recommend that you take any medication, whether it be a natural remedy or an over-the-counter or prescription drug, unless you have discussed it with your GP first. I once saw a patient who had been advised by a friend to soak his feet in potassium-permanganate solution to help his eczema (a treatment that might have been effective had it been supervised by a trained professional) and who ended up with severe liver problems.</p> <p>The most common reason that the level of liver enzymes may shoot upwards is drinking too much alcohol, in which case your doctor will tell you that your gamma GT reading is higher than usual. Although some people are astounded by this diagnosis, especially if they don't drink much, it may be that their livers are extremely sensitive. Or it may be the result of a previous illness. If this is the case, your doctor won't worry about this unduly, unless the levels change significantly. You will probably be told to start looking after your liver and after a few months your enzyme levels should return to normal.</p> <p>You may be advised either to avoid alcohol for a few months or to cut down your intake. Many people find that spirits, which have a high alcohol content, hit the liver harder than wine. It's therefore generally better to stick to wine and not to drink on an empty stomach, which unleashes a rush of concentrated alcohol into your system, making your liver work overtime. Drinking a small amount of wine with a meal is the best plan, because food keeps the alcohol in the stomach for longer, slows down its absorption rate and enables the liver to work at a comfortable pace. (Not all wines suit a stressed liver, however, and dessert wines can be particularly aggravating.) Although beer seems to be well tolerated by the liver, its main drawback is that we tend to drink it when we are not eating. Yet many beers provide an excellent accompaniment to food - light beers suit Japanese food very well, for example, while a Guinness complements a ploughman's lunch perfectly - just remember to have a few mouthfuls of food before sipping your pint. Caffeine also irritates the liver, so reduce your intake of caffeine-containing drinks to a maximum of two a day.</p> <p>If you have raised liver enzyme levels, but no other medical problems, a daily combination of a well-balanced, healthy diet, comprising lots of fresh vegetables, fruit, lean proteins and fibre, with 2.5 litres of water (which helps the liver to rid itself of unwanted waste products or toxins) will enable your liver to return to normal as quickly as possible.</p> <p>There is one nutritional substance to which you should pay particular attention, however: fat. Whether it is of vegetable or animal origin, fat is one of the hardest foods for the body to break down and metabolise, which makes it even more difficult for a stressed liver, triggering indigestion, nausea, bloating, wind and a general feeling of heaviness (hence the expression 'feeling liverish'). It's therefore best to keep your intake of fried foods, cream, butter-rich pastries and cheese to a minimum. The liver hates having to cope with concentrated fats, so either eat a little fat often or accompany a fatty food with a fibre-containing one - have a piece of cheese with a slice of wholegrain bread or some grapes, for instance. Keep your food simple and chargrill fish, roast lean meats, steam young vegetables and dress them with fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil instead of dowsing them with lashings of b\u00e9chamel-type sauces. If your weight tends to be on the low side, and you are worried about cutting out such a rich source of calories from your diet, step up your intake of starchy foods (carbohydrates), such as pasta, rice, potatoes, bread and desserts made with sugar and fruit, such as sorbets, chocolate dishes, stewed rhubarb or poached peaches.</p> <p>Regard receiving a diagnosis of raised levels of liver enzymes as an opportunity to re-evaluate your diet and to adopt eating habits that you'll enjoy for a long time to come. Even when your readings return to normal, your liver will thank you if you continue to give it a break and don't demand such a high, and frequently unachievable, performance from it.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books</p>",

He had picked it up from an enlightened fitness instructor who went round bomb shelters during the Blitz teaching stressed-out women to sleep at will. Gran always took a nap under the desk at her office in the lunch break to give her the energy she needed to raise nine children, and at 85 she is more alert than I am at 36.</p> <p>Typically, I have only started to concede that my grandmother might have a point because a friend shoved a glossy, hardback tome by the world's leading sleep expert, Dr William Dement, into my hands; they were fed up of hearing me moan about how tired I was. In The Promise of Sleep (Macmillan, \u00a316.99) Dr Dement, director of the sleep disorders clinic and research centre at Stanford University, painstakingly takes the layman on an easy-to-read journey through his many years of scientific sleep research. He states that 'nature definitely intended that adults should nap in the afternoons because just as we have a significant drop in body-core temperature and alertness at night, we also have a similar but smaller drop in the middle of the day'. Which is why most of us - especially those who have a significant sleep 'debt' because they have difficulty sleeping at night, or go out partying too much, work long hours or have small children - feel particularly tired between the hours of 2pm and 4pm.</p> <p>The nap, Dement says, should be short because the brain and body must stay within the realms of the first two stages of sleep and not enter into deep sleep. In these early stages, your breathing rate begins to slow, as do your brain waves, your eye movements and your heartbeat. You may have fleeting visual imagery, or 'hypnagognic hallucinations'. Your muscles will briefly relax and your brain-stem stimulation via muscle nerves will be reduced. You will become disengaged and blind and deaf to most outside stimulation for a short while, but you should either train yourself to wake up or use an alarm at this point. If you sleep for more than 30 minutes, you will enter a deep sleep and your muscles relax completely. Blood pressure drops, pulse and respiration are slowed and the blood supply to the brain is minimal. If you are then awakened from stage three and four sleep, you will feel distinctly groggy.</p> <p>Churchill advocated the need for a quick nap long before the Stanford research, and is famous for planning his cabinet war meetings around his afternoon shuteye. Mike Jackson, commander of the Nato peace-keeping force in Kosovo, kept a camp bed by his desk so he could take a nap whenever he felt his mental agility was being impaired by sleepiness. Other famous nappers include Napoleon, Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison.</p> <p>More average workplaces tend not to be conducive to napping, though, despite a great deal of effort in the mid-90s by Professor James B Maas (author of Miracle Sleep Cure - The Key to a Long Life of Peak Performance ; Thorsons, \u00a37.99) to promote 'the power nap'. While a few companies installed quiet areas and Richard Reeves, director of futures at the Industrial Society, predicted that in the 'near future most companies will install bunk beds for power naps', the idea never really caught on because workers were unwilling to be seen as dozy wimps with a kindergarten routine.</p> <p>Last month, the American National Sleep association released the results of an extensive sleep survey which showed that although one-third of workers felt they needed a nap during the day, less then 10 per cent of those had ever slept at work. All of them gave their bosses' negative reactions as their main reason for not napping.</p> <p>There is certainly a lot of guilt associated with any kind of afternoon sleep in this country. While the sexy siesta is unashamedly taken to escape the midday sun, the nap is associated with infants and senior citizens in 'lazy-boy' chairs. We are 'caught napping' and try to excuse ourselves when we are woken with a start by saying that we were just taking '40 winks'. The World Nap Organization, which aims to promote 'guilt-free' naps, says that even at the weekend, spouses were the main 'guilters', with 67 per cent of the 600 people it surveyed saying that their partners made them feel lazy when they took a mid-afternoon sleep. This, of course, is due to every couple's lifelong tiredness competition, with the weekend nap used either as a bargaining tool ('All right, you sleep now if I can lie in tomorrow') or as a sign of rebellion or retreat against the idea of a jolly family weekend.</p> <p>The sleepy spouse might like to point out to the 'guilter' that the nap now has the backing of the Department of Transport. As most car accidents happen either in the middle of the night or in the afternoon when we fall into our sleepiest 'trough', the Highway Code recommends that a nap is the best response to feeling tired at the wheel. As Professor Jim Horne, director of sleep research at Loughborough University, says: 'The Highway Code advises drivers who feel drowsy to pull in at the nearest service station and take a brief nap. This shows that governmental Health and Safety bodies recognise that a light sleep of 15 minutes will make the driver feel refreshed and able to safely continue. It can do wonders for the mental performance - and the same thing can be applied to situations other then driving.'</p> <p>The House of Commons is probably the only place packed full of unabashed guilt-free catnappers because of late-night sit-ins, long lunches and, perhaps, the Churchillian catnap as precedent. Although some MPs snooze discreetly in their offices, many simply put their feet up in the main chamber and openly snore their way through a minor speech.</p> <p>In your own office, try and find a nearby chair, sofa or soft floor. Alternatively, bring in a comfortable pillow and put your head on your desk, with your arms folded above your head. Turn off the ringer on your phone, let everyone know that you are trying this experiment to keep you alert, and see if you can train yourself to doze for a short space of time. You could do what a friend who works in a particularly dynamic PR company does each lunchtime, which is go to the quietest place in her local library and have a quick zizz. 'No one cares because everyone is so used to people dropping off there,' she says. Another friend working in the film industry always takes his deckchair on set and places it as far away from everyone else as he can.</p> <p>Try and talk to your boss about the reduction in errors and accidents and the increased productivity and improved atmosphere that a nap-friendly atmosphere would encourage. Invite a sleep expert to give a seminar to your company. If all else fails, quote Churchill: 'Don't think that you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That's a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination.' *</p> <p><b> The art of napping</b></p> <p>\u0095 The nap should be about 10 to 30 minutes long. Any longer, and your body will fall into delta, or deep, sleep. The body only needs a short sleep because the nervous system is very resilient and easily rejuvenated . If the nap is too long, slow- wave sleep will occur and all of the body's systems will slow down.</p> <p>Use an alarm if you do not trust yourself to wake up within this time and if you are severely sleep deprived and feel you must nap for longer, extend your sleep to 90 minutes, but don't expect to be fully alert until at least an hour after a long nap.</p> <p>\u0095 If you want to start napping, then reduce your caffeine intake. Caffeine is only a brief fix for tiredness, whereas a nap is what your body needs.</p> <p>\u0095 A nap is not a good idea if you have severe difficulty falling asleep at night. If you are taking a regular daytime nap for longer than 30 minutes, you may find that this is what is stopping you from having good, continuous night-time sleep.</p> <p>\u0095 If you are going to take a controlled nap in the day, try to make a habit of it. A sudden irregular nap might disrupt your internal body clock and nocturnal sleeping pattern.</p> <p>\u0095 Taking naps only at weekends will not do a lot for your general alertness. Brief naps taken daily are far healthier than sleeping in or taking very long naps at the weekend. Weekend napping is like only dieting and exercising at weekends - it won't work as a way of reaching your 'peak performance'.</p> <p>\u0095 Late-afternoon napping is not recommended by any of the sleep experts. It can delay your falling-asleep time in the evening and begins to shift your biological clock, making getting up in the morning a struggle.</p> <p>\u0095 You might decide that a refreshing nap is a good idea but find that you can't seem to fall asleep. It may be that you are getting enough sleep anyway, and just relaxing with your eyes closed will be beneficial in restoring your energy.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have excessive daytime sleepiness, recurring episodes of naps or lapses into sleep, then you may have a more serious problem than sleep deprivation. Narcolepsy is a medical condition in which the sufferer will sleep for15 to 20 minutes and wake up feeling refreshed, only to feel chronically tired again within the next two to three hours. Sudden sleep attacks can occur in situations when sleeping is quite inappropriate, such as while eating, talking, laughing or driving. It is thought that one in every 2,000 people suffers from narcolepsy, although 80 per cent go undiagnosed. With controlled sleep and proper medication, narcolepsy can be managed.</p> <p><b> Websites </b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sleepnet.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sleepnet.com/</a><br> Everything you want to know about sleep but are too tired to ask.

      "body": "<p>To most of you, it was just a news story, but to me it was something more. In 1991, a 19-year-old former public schoolboy named Andrew Smith arrived in New York to take up a place at art school. He found that student digs weren't to his liking, so, being an ambitious sort, checked into the glamorous Pierre Hotel, blowing his $4,500 savings on a binge that lasted a week. A fortnight later, he returned and - check this for style - stayed for five whole months, amassing a bill of $45,000. With no hope of paying, he signed an American Express voucher belonging to another Andrew Smith and scarpered, but was caught by the FBI, charged with fraud, and sent home to south-east London to await trial.</p> <p>This was strange, yet still short of bizarre. That came next. Smith did a runner to France, where he became a celebrity cat breeder and hit trouble only last year, when he called the Pierre with an offer to pay back the money he owed. Rather than accept, they alerted Interpol, and on 19 February of this year, Smith's home in Bourg-en-Bresse was raided by 10 gendarmes who had failed to wonder whether he would in fact be in. He wasn't, went into hiding, and was at large until a fortnight ago, when he was finally apprehended in Lyon. He is currently on hunger strike in a French prison.</p> <p>Now, like you, I read all this assuming it had been scripted by John Cleese or Michael Frayne. Until I got to the end. This was where Smith claimed that he never meant to sign someone else's credit-card slip, but that the hotel staff had mistaken him for another Andrew Smith, who had stayed there earlier. To the lay person, this defence may sound lame, implausible, preposterous even, but I know where he's coming from and I've got at least 7,645 countrymen who are with me on this. If we banded together and marched over to France, we could probably spring him ourselves. Allow me to explain.</p> <p>There's this joke that I've always loved. It's old and may strike some readers as mildly profane, though I can't help but see it as poetic and strangely moving. It goes something like this.</p> <p>'A young Native American brave goes to see his chief one day. \"Chief,\" he asks, earnestly, \"how do you choose what names to give us?\" The chief looks down at the boy, then up into the far distance as he slips into a reverie. \"Why, I look to the earth and the sky for guidance,\" he says. \"If I see the moon rising among the stars, I name the brave Rising Moon. If I spy the buffalo sweeping majestically across the plain, I name him Running Buffalo. If the eagle swoops above, he will be Flying Eagle. Anyway, why do you ask, Two Dogs Humping?\"'</p> <p>Like any decent person, I can empathise with poor Two Dogs, forever having to spell his name three times over to querulous bank tellers and at airport check-ins. At the same time, part of my amusement at this joke undoubtedly stems from a conviction that Two Dogs's plight could have been very much worse. He could, for instance, have been named Two Dogs Smith.</p> <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, eight out of the top 10 most common names in England (no figures exist for the UK as a whole) end in Smith. My own weighs in at number eight, well down on the chart-topping David (my brother and 13,621 others) and James (my father), but enough to spread confusion wherever I go and be a constant source of chagrin.</p> <p>The truth is that Andrew on its own would have been bad enough. In itself, it's a good name, of Greek origin, meaning 'manly, with strength', but that's not the whole story. No one knows why some names explode in popularity at given times - although Professor David Hargreaves of Surrey University has a theory of 'cyclical vogues' (Sharon is due round again soon, you might like to note) - but from the mid-50s through to the 60s, mine did. There were always three or four others in my form at school and, like many Andrews of our generation, I have had to live with the disturbing thought that I might have been named after Prince Andrew, and, speaking personally, I would rather have been named after a mound of Tesco own-brand lard.</p> <p>At the moment, we Andrew Smiths seem to be popping up all over the place. Apart from our representative in France, there is the prolific striker who plays for Kilmarnock in Scotland and Andrew Smith MP, who has managed the considerable feat of being Chief Secretary to the Treasury while remaining absolutely true to the anonymity implied by his name.</p> <p>To be sure, having such a common handle has brought certain advantages. At school, it was usually possible to avoid unpleasant rituals like cross-country runs by feigning the assumption that all of the 'A Smiths' on the starter's sheet referred to someone else. And I get other people's email every day, including one long and fruity exchange between a namesake and the woman with whom he is having a torrid affair, which arrived faithfully every day for a time, like my own personal soap opera.</p> <p>Mostly, though, there has been the irritation of being confused for others and feeling your own identity in the world compromised, diluted if you like, through being shared with so many others. Picture my horror when, stumbling across a numerology website in the course of researching this article, I tapped in the names of several friends and family members, to be given back values of 54, 68, 74, then keyed in my own and received a huge, mocking '0' in return. This really happened.</p> <p>And still I went into a profession where your name is really all you have. I've always been suspicious of this. Was I trying to claim it, finally, for my own? If so, was I alone in feeling that impulse? All of which begged a greater question. When we have children, we agonise over what to call them, instinctively realising that our decision will impact on their subsequent lives. Equally, performers understand that different names carry different expectations, independently of the person they're attached to, which is why they often change them. To what extent, then, do they shape us as we travel through life, and how?</p> <p>A Puritan preacher supposedly once told his congregation that 'a good name is a thread tyed about the finger, to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our master.' According to Elsdon Smith and his Treasury of Name Lore , a good name would have been along the lines of Flie-fornication, or Steadfast-on-high, or Obedience (these are the people who founded the USA, lest we forget), but while we might quibble his reading of the details, the preacher's point stands. Name is identity, a place in the world.</p> <p>It turns out that surnames have only been used in the way that we use them since the end of the 16th century. They were initially intended only to distinguish between people of the same given name and could be based on a father's first name or occupation (David's son, O'Kelly, Plumber, Smith), a place of residence (York, Hastings), or an epithet based on some notable personal trait (Swift, Little, Arm-strong). These only turned into hereditary surnames in the early Middle Ages, beginning, scholarship suggests, with aristocrats and in the cities. Women forfeited their surnames on marriage, just as slaves in the southern states of America were initially denied them. As Amy and Leon Kass of the University of Chicago note: 'The slaveholders understood perfectly that this made the childish station permanent, with neither a public life, nor a properly private life possible in relation to the wider world.'</p> <p>So, names also represent power. Anthropologists tell us that in many pre-industrial societies, naming ceremonies mark the bestowing of a soul upon the child, while in Christian doctrine, they signify a claiming of the soul. In either case, notes Deluzain, the effect is the same: 'The person who receives a name thereby receives an identity and place in society.' The registering and granting of certificates of birth thus represent a contract between the individual and society. If either side is deemed to have failed its part of the bargain, dissatisfaction is often expressed through the changing or withholding of names, as when Cassius Clay rejected his 'slave name' in favour of Muhammad Ali, or when prisoners are forced to exchange theirs for numbers.</p> <p>Similarly, the oldest debating trick in the book is to mispronounce an opponent's name. Freud purported to notice that aristocrats mispronounced their doctors' names more than others and thought that this was an unconscious means of recovering some of the power that any patient surrenders on walking through a surgery door. In his book Real Men , author Frank Rose describes the process by which recruits are ejected from the ranks, which involves being marched to the gates, accompanied by slow drum rolls and imprecations never to mention the disgraced soldier's name again.</p> <p>'From a strictly objective point of view, blotting out a person's name in a club registry or forbidding cadets to mention a name in the future does absolutely nothing to change either the person or what he or she did. However, the link between name and identity is so strong and the importance of the symbolic name bargain so great that we genuinely feel that actions of this type somehow have the desired effect of making the person a nonentity.'</p> <p>Where does this leave us Andrew Smiths? Halfway between White City and Television Centre, as it happens. Meeting up with a sample was a comic exercise in itself. At the BBC, I trailed from one building to another as receptionists insisted that they had dozens of Andy Smiths and the one I was looking for, like corkscrews and torches whenever you need them, was always somewhere else.

      "bodyText": "To most of you, it was just a news story, but to me it was something more. In 1991, a 19-year-old former public schoolboy named Andrew Smith arrived in New York to take up a place at art school. He found that student digs weren't to his liking, so, being an ambitious sort, checked into the glamorous Pierre Hotel, blowing his $4,500 savings on a binge that lasted a week. A fortnight later, he returned and - check this for style - stayed for five whole months, amassing a bill of $45,000. With no hope of paying, he signed an American Express voucher belonging to another Andrew Smith and scarpered, but was caught by the FBI, charged with fraud, and sent home to south-east London to await trial. This was strange, yet still short of bizarre. That came next. Smith did a runner to France, where he became a celebrity cat breeder and hit trouble only last year, when he called the Pierre with an offer to pay back the money he owed. Rather than accept, they alerted Interpol, and on 19 February of this year, Smith's home in Bourg-en-Bresse was raided by 10 gendarmes who had failed to wonder whether he would in fact be in. He wasn't, went into hiding, and was at large until a fortnight ago, when he was finally apprehended in Lyon. He is currently on hunger strike in a French prison. Now, like you, I read all this assuming it had been scripted by John Cleese or Michael Frayne. Until I got to the end. This was where Smith claimed that he never meant to sign someone else's credit-card slip, but that the hotel staff had mistaken him for another Andrew Smith, who had stayed there earlier. To the lay person, this defence may sound lame, implausible, preposterous even, but I know where he's coming from and I've got at least 7,645 countrymen who are with me on this. If we banded together and marched over to France, we could probably spring him ourselves. Allow me to explain. There's this joke that I've always loved. It's old and may strike some readers as mildly profane, though I can't help but see it as poetic and strangely moving. It goes something like this. 'A young Native American brave goes to see his chief one day. \"Chief,\" he asks, earnestly, \"how do you choose what names to give us?\" The chief looks down at the boy, then up into the far distance as he slips into a reverie. \"Why, I look to the earth and the sky for guidance,\" he says. \"If I see the moon rising among the stars, I name the brave Rising Moon. If I spy the buffalo sweeping majestically across the plain, I name him Running Buffalo. If the eagle swoops above, he will be Flying Eagle. Anyway, why do you ask, Two Dogs Humping?\"' Like any decent person, I can empathise with poor Two Dogs, forever having to spell his name three times over to querulous bank tellers and at airport check-ins. At the same time, part of my amusement at this joke undoubtedly stems from a conviction that Two Dogs's plight could have been very much worse. He could, for instance, have been named Two Dogs Smith. According to the Office for National Statistics, eight out of the top 10 most common names in England (no figures exist for the UK as a whole) end in Smith. My own weighs in at number eight, well down on the chart-topping David (my brother and 13,621 others) and James (my father), but enough to spread confusion wherever I go and be a constant source of chagrin. The truth is that Andrew on its own would have been bad enough. In itself, it's a good name, of Greek origin, meaning 'manly, with strength', but that's not the whole story. No one knows why some names explode in popularity at given times - although Professor David Hargreaves of Surrey University has a theory of 'cyclical vogues' (Sharon is due round again soon, you might like to note) - but from the mid-50s through to the 60s, mine did. There were always three or four others in my form at school and, like many Andrews of our generation, I have had to live with the disturbing thought that I might have been named after Prince Andrew, and, speaking personally, I would rather have been named after a mound of Tesco own-brand lard. At the moment, we Andrew Smiths seem to be popping up all over the place. Apart from our representative in France, there is the prolific striker who plays for Kilmarnock in Scotland and Andrew Smith MP, who has managed the considerable feat of being Chief Secretary to the Treasury while remaining absolutely true to the anonymity implied by his name. To be sure, having such a common handle has brought certain advantages. At school, it was usually possible to avoid unpleasant rituals like cross-country runs by feigning the assumption that all of the 'A Smiths' on the starter's sheet referred to someone else. And I get other people's email every day, including one long and fruity exchange between a namesake and the woman with whom he is having a torrid affair, which arrived faithfully every day for a time, like my own personal soap opera. Mostly, though, there has been the irritation of being confused for others and feeling your own identity in the world compromised, diluted if you like, through being shared with so many others. Picture my horror when, stumbling across a numerology website in the course of researching this article, I tapped in the names of several friends and family members, to be given back values of 54, 68, 74, then keyed in my own and received a huge, mocking '0' in return. This really happened. And still I went into a profession where your name is really all you have. I've always been suspicious of this. Was I trying to claim it, finally, for my own? If so, was I alone in feeling that impulse? All of which begged a greater question. When we have children, we agonise over what to call them, instinctively realising that our decision will impact on their subsequent lives. Equally, performers understand that different names carry different expectations, independently of the person they're attached to, which is why they often change them. To what extent, then, do they shape us as we travel through life, and how? A Puritan preacher supposedly once told his congregation that 'a good name is a thread tyed about the finger, to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our master.' According to Elsdon Smith and his Treasury of Name Lore , a good name would have been along the lines of Flie-fornication, or Steadfast-on-high, or Obedience (these are the people who founded the USA, lest we forget), but while we might quibble his reading of the details, the preacher's point stands. Name is identity, a place in the world. It turns out that surnames have only been used in the way that we use them since the end of the 16th century. They were initially intended only to distinguish between people of the same given name and could be based on a father's first name or occupation (David's son, O'Kelly, Plumber, Smith), a place of residence (York, Hastings), or an epithet based on some notable personal trait (Swift, Little, Arm-strong). These only turned into hereditary surnames in the early Middle Ages, beginning, scholarship suggests, with aristocrats and in the cities. Women forfeited their surnames on marriage, just as slaves in the southern states of America were initially denied them. As Amy and Leon Kass of the University of Chicago note: 'The slaveholders understood perfectly that this made the childish station permanent, with neither a public life, nor a properly private life possible in relation to the wider world.' So, names also represent power. Anthropologists tell us that in many pre-industrial societies, naming ceremonies mark the bestowing of a soul upon the child, while in Christian doctrine, they signify a claiming of the soul. In either case, notes Deluzain, the effect is the same: 'The person who receives a name thereby receives an identity and place in society.' The registering and granting of certificates of birth thus represent a contract between the individual and society. If either side is deemed to have failed its part of the bargain, dissatisfaction is often expressed through the changing or withholding of names, as when Cassius Clay rejected his 'slave name' in favour of Muhammad Ali, or when prisoners are forced to exchange theirs for numbers. Similarly, the oldest debating trick in the book is to mispronounce an opponent's name. Freud purported to notice that aristocrats mispronounced their doctors' names more than others and thought that this was an unconscious means of recovering some of the power that any patient surrenders on walking through a surgery door. In his book Real Men , author Frank Rose describes the process by which recruits are ejected from the ranks, which involves being marched to the gates, accompanied by slow drum rolls and imprecations never to mention the disgraced soldier's name again. 'From a strictly objective point of view, blotting out a person's name in a club registry or forbidding cadets to mention a name in the future does absolutely nothing to change either the person or what he or she did. However, the link between name and identity is so strong and the importance of the symbolic name bargain so great that we genuinely feel that actions of this type somehow have the desired effect of making the person a nonentity.' Where does this leave us Andrew Smiths? Halfway between White City and Television Centre, as it happens. Meeting up with a sample was a comic exercise in itself. At the BBC, I trailed from one building to another as receptionists insisted that they had dozens of Andy Smiths and the one I was looking for, like corkscrews and torches whenever you need them, was always somewhere else. The matre d' at the restaurant where I met Andy the illustrator asked for my name and that of the person I was meeting three times before finally surrendering to the fact that they were the same, even though we manifestly weren't. By the time I found him sitting at the bar, he had convinced himself that the whole thing was a cruel hoax perpetrated by his agent. Everyone mentioned the same things: the nudges and winks at seaside hotels and B&amp;Bs when you book a room for yourself and your girlfriend and give your name as Smith; receiving the wrong post ('I feel like I know the other Andy Smiths at the BBC, because I'm always opening their letters by mistake'); phone conversations which stutter to a halt in the realisation that the other party thinks you're someone else they know of the same name; irritation at credit-card ads which use 'A Smith' as a cipher for 'any old sod' or 'anonymous'. Everyone had had the feeling that they've had to work harder to be noticed at various points in their lives, even if, in retrospect, they were misguided. We all got on well and mixed easily.

A perfect friend performs the following tasks seamlessly: telling me the truth, but only when I am in a state of ripeness to hear it. Comforting me, most particularly when I am unable to ask for it. Supporting me, but not out of pity. Loving me, but without mailing me an emotional invoice for it. A perfect friend would never turn up more than five minutes late for dinner, would be ready to show their own vulnerabilities, pay for their round, and smoke Marlboro Reds (so I could bum one occasionally). They'd not be afraid to give compliments (something that men find perplexingly difficult), and would criticise only in order to heal rather than to harm. Now that I think about it, if I had a perfect best friend, I'd marry them. Yet the friends I do have are wonderful in their imperfections, and they are the best friends I could ever hope for in a world in which imperfection is the rule and in which I myself am about as far as you can get from being an exception to that rule. \u0095 White City Blue , Tim Lott's Whitbread Award- winning novel about male friendship, is published by Penguin, price \u00a36.99",

      "body": "<p>Britain's architects have a spring in their step, thanks to all the city bonuses splurged on Clerkenwell's lofts and the restaurant epidemic in London - both of which came on top of the tidal wave of Lottery-funded projects. At last they have a chance to design real buildings, and buildings that get noticed, at that. Their new museums, apartments and bars, with their Eames chairs and blonde-wood floors, are published in all the glossies. Their portraits get in the papers. Tony Blair invites them for drinks in Downing Street. There is a palpable sense that architects feel better about themselves than they have done for 30 years, that they are not being ignored in the way they so comprehensively once were - and the Prince of Wales is nothing but a bad memory. </p> <p>If there was anything sadder than the sight of a breast-beating British architect of the 70s blaming himself for all the failures of high-rise housing, it was the spectacle of a British architect of the 80s jogging forlornly in the dust, trying to leap on to the running board of Britain's fundamentally literary culture. 'Look,' they would tell anybody who would listen, 'everybody abroad loves what we do; they hire us to build the Pompidou and redesign the Reichstag, so we are important. We matter even if everybody back home ignores us. We aren't just builders or boring engineers.' Now, even the notoriously cautious founder of Future Systems, Jan Kaplicky, is beginning to look more cheerful: people are giving him work, though he was well past 50 before he got to build the press box at Lord's cricket ground, the first decent-sized project of his entire career to date. </p> <p>But it's still easy to get the impression that there is nothing Britain's young architects - and this is a description that has very little to do with calendar age - would like to be so much as young British artists. It's so much more fun being Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, the Chapman brothers or Sam Taylor-Wood, than it is being David Chipperfield, Nigel Coates or Will Alsop. Let alone being Alex de Rijke, Sally Mackereth or Louisa Hutton. For a start, things happen so much quicker. Hirst was cleaning up in the shark business straight after his degree show. Chipperfield is still fighting for work at home 20 years after he left the Architectural Association. Of course there is a generational mismatch: Chipperfield's art-world equivalent would belong to the Richard Long or Antony Gormley era of those who have already made it big time, but Chipperfield is only just beginning to surface in the cultural bigger picture. Hutton, 10 years younger than Chipperfield, belongs to the young British artists' generation, but she has had to move to Berlin to get to build anything larger than domestic conversions, and is still all but invisible in London. </p> <p>It's also more fun being an artist because you don't have to labour under the burden of an all-consuming paranoia about being overtaken by your contemporaries in the ceaseless and pitiless struggle for the next commission. Tate Modern is good news for every young British artist. They may not get to exhibit their work there right away, but they still have a chance next year, or even in the next decade. But for architects, it's very different. There is, by definition, only one chance to design the most important new art gallery in Britain for 50 years, every 50 years. So you could see decidedly mixed feelings on the faces of a lot of the not-so-young British architects as they walked around the Tate's opening party last month. They were too smart to say it, but there was a palpable sense of 'it could have been me' in the air. </p> <p>Architecture, like art, is a conversation, with private languages, cliques and alliances. But, in the end, nothing matters more for an architect struggling to establish a reputation than the chance to build. There are so few chances to build projects that really matter, that nothing else - certainly not group loyalty, friendship or artistic alliances - comes before the determination to get the job. </p> <p>And the group now taking on the role of Britain's leading architects can still remember the fate of their predecessors who taught them in the 70s, condemned by the three-day week, the oil shock and the miners' strike to a career of paper architecture and unbuilt competition wins. They don't want to go the same way, but their prospects are still cluttered up by the big beasts ahead of them that so obstinately refuse to move over to let them move up. Norman Foster is still the most respected British architect internationally, and he is still busy soaking up the lion's share of the best jobs in town. </p> <p>Richard Rogers is still the best politically connected architect in Britain since the 30s. Nick Grimshaw, far from fading away as a hi-tech period piece, is putting on a late burst of speed, picking up significant new projects. Terry Farrell is continuing to reinvent himself. And if the Alsops and the Chipperfields still aren't where they think they ought to be by now, where does this leave the generation coming after them? </p> <p>The subtext to the Architecture Biennale in Venice is intimately connected with all these tangled concerns. The Biennale is deep in art community's territory. It's where the British Council gave everybody from Anthony Caro to Gilbert and George a highly visible platform. It's where Norman Foster and James Stirling were lionised. And this year it's where the fading classical stucco of the British pavilion will house work by four London-based architects: Will Alsop, Nigel Coates, Zaha Hadid and David Chipperfield - a choice that embodies the dilemmas and tensions underlying contemporary British architecture. The Venice Architecture Biennale is a curious event, a cross between the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and a low-rent expo. It's staged as often as the city of Venice manages to raise enough cash - which makes for intervals that can be rather longer than its title implies. </p> <p>And it sprawls far beyond the grandeur of the Biennale garden, with its collection of national pavilions, and out into the old ropery and warehouses of the Arsenale and the city itself. It is, so Venice would like us all to think, the most important event in the architectural calendar bar none. To be invited to exhibit represents major recognition. To be the commissioner means a chance to change the course of architectural history. Certainly that happened back in the early 80s, when one particular biennale turned out to be a mass rally for the forces of soon-to-be ubiquitous postmodernism which went on an unstoppable rampage all over the world soon afterwards. Its impact is still being felt, from the terracotta towers of Canary Wharf to the business parks of Shenzen. </p> <p>This year's commissioner is Massimiliano Fuksas - an architect from Rome who is trying to give it a point of view by setting the Biennale theme on a course that is ostensibly an exploration of the social concerns of architecture rather than its aesthetics. Britain's role is directed by the British Council - the first to admit that when it comes to architecture it is on ground much less solid than it is with art or literature. But it seized on the social theme of the Biennale, and decided to make the remarkable collection of new architecture along London's Jubilee Line extension the focus for the exhibition. It wanted to look at the impact of architecture on regenerating east London. </p> <p>In the event, the show isn't about that. The British Council couldn't raise the money. What it is now setting out to do is mark a changing of the guard. David Chipperfield, Will Alsop, Zaha Hadid and Nigel Coates are all in the late-forties to early-fifties age bracket - that sets them up as the generation taking over from Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and James Stirling. Those were the big three who set the tone for British architects for almost 25 years. Now it's time for a fresh look at the nature of British architecture. The trouble with architecture in Britain is that it carries the burden of utility in a way that its practitioners never quite know how to deal with. It has had the effect of creating a massive inferiority complex among the architects, when they compare themselves with artists. Go around an average school of architecture now, and you will find them turning out projects that look more and more like bad art. You'll find architecture students fiddling about with video cameras, constructing automatic drawing machines, working on installations - almost anything, in fact, but dealing with the tiresome quest for designing buildings that keep the rain out. </p> <p>And this anxiety about art and status is, to some extent, reflected in the British quartet at Venice. It is a group which is, of course, not really a group: four architects who might be characterised as representing the war between the blob tendency and the box faction. On one side is Will Alsop who, after a shaky start as a postmodernist, built a very big, blobby, blue building outside Marseille, which serves as a town hall for the area. On the other is the cooler rationalism of the box tendency, represented in Venice by David Chipperfield. Nigel Coates, with his partner Doug Branson, is certainly in the blob camp, with an exhibit at Venice called Ecstacity. It was Coates who shaped the baroque muscles of the Dome's Body Zone, and who created the ill-fated National Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield. Hadid doesn't do blobs. She makes boxes that have been shattered and sliced open. Her contribution to the Venice show is a vivid display on three bridges. </p> <p>The underlying premise behind all the fuss about Venice is that Britain is world class when it comes to architecture. Is this true? Well, the common thread shared by all the British exhibitors is that they have built hardly anything at home. David Chipperfield is master-planning the Museum Island in Berlin. He is also building a law court in Salerno and an institute of contemporary arts in Milan. But in London he was beaten by Nick Grimshaw to do a new building for the Royal College of Art. Hadid is the architect who was the subject of the absurd row over the Cardiff Bay Opera House, a project killed off by the very same millennium commissioners who authorised yet another emergency multi-million bail-out for the Dome, because the project, in their judgment, lacked a proper business plan. Abroad, she's building in America and Italy. Alsop has managed to build rather more than the rest, but even he is doing more in Germany than at home. </p> <p>Are they as good, for example, as those international protagonists in the battle between the blob and the box: Frank Gehry and Herzog and de Meuron? The four have yet to prove themselves. They have so far shown promise, as have so many other architects that the British Council might have selected to exhibit at the Biennale. Though they all have yet to build the buildings that will really mark their coming of age.</p>",

Those were the big three who set the tone for British architects for almost 25 years. Now it's time for a fresh look at the nature of British architecture. The trouble with architecture in Britain is that it carries the burden of utility in a way that its practitioners never quite know how to deal with. It has had the effect of creating a massive inferiority complex among the architects, when they compare themselves with artists. Go around an average school of architecture now, and you will find them turning out projects that look more and more like bad art. You'll find architecture students fiddling about with video cameras, constructing automatic drawing machines, working on installations - almost anything, in fact, but dealing with the tiresome quest for designing buildings that keep the rain out. And this anxiety about art and status is, to some extent, reflected in the British quartet at Venice. It is a group which is, of course, not really a group: four architects who might be characterised as representing the war between the blob tendency and the box faction. On one side is Will Alsop who, after a shaky start as a postmodernist, built a very big, blobby, blue building outside Marseille, which serves as a town hall for the area. On the other is the cooler rationalism of the box tendency, represented in Venice by David Chipperfield. Nigel Coates, with his partner Doug Branson, is certainly in the blob camp, with an exhibit at Venice called Ecstacity. It was Coates who shaped the baroque muscles of the Dome's Body Zone, and who created the ill-fated National Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield. Hadid doesn't do blobs. She makes boxes that have been shattered and sliced open. Her contribution to the Venice show is a vivid display on three bridges. The underlying premise behind all the fuss about Venice is that Britain is world class when it comes to architecture. Is this true? Well, the common thread shared by all the British exhibitors is that they have built hardly anything at home. David Chipperfield is master-planning the Museum Island in Berlin. He is also building a law court in Salerno and an institute of contemporary arts in Milan. But in London he was beaten by Nick Grimshaw to do a new building for the Royal College of Art. Hadid is the architect who was the subject of the absurd row over the Cardiff Bay Opera House, a project killed off by the very same millennium commissioners who authorised yet another emergency multi-million bail-out for the Dome, because the project, in their judgment, lacked a proper business plan. Abroad, she's building in America and Italy. Alsop has managed to build rather more than the rest, but even he is doing more in Germany than at home. Are they as good, for example, as those international protagonists in the battle between the blob and the box: Frank Gehry and Herzog and de Meuron? The four have yet to prove themselves. They have so far shown promise, as have so many other architects that the British Council might have selected to exhibit at the Biennale. Though they all have yet to build the buildings that will really mark their coming of age.",

      "body": "<p>I'm off everything now. I couldn't have written another book if I hadn't cleaned up.' Yep, Will Self, at 38, is free of his long addiction to drugs and alcohol, and prepared to shed whatever dubious glamour that gave him. Before, he's always fudged the issue. His line for many years was that he'd been a heroin addict in his late teens and early twenties, but cleaned up in 1986. </p> <p>This was true as far as it went - but didn't really address the question of how far he'd relapsed in subsequent years. It was always obvious that he was on something , the only question was what. He says now that he never went back to injecting heroin, but he did use it - and cocaine, and alcohol, and anything else going. For most of the 90s, he says, 'I was pushing a bottle of Scotch a day. But I never in all those 10 years ended up back on heroin because my body just couldn't take it - I'd use it for a few days or at most a few weeks and I'd become too physically ill and run-down to continue. I'd go on a binge, then come off with pot and booze, or try and taper off and maintain that, and then relapse on to heroin - over and over again trying to switch combinations and trying to find a way in which I could continue to get loaded without it being a problem.' </p> <p>He thought no one knew, though he realises now that 'a highly visible addict is like a child who hides behind a tree and thinks they can't be seen because they can't see you. But after the incident of 1997 [when he took heroin on the prime minister's plane] anybody who read a tabloid knew that I had a drug problem, while I still obstinately refused to acknowledge that I did myself.' </p> <p>But, since last October, he has been sober and seems confident that he can remain so. Some of his friends are more sceptical - they say things like, 'It's early days,' and point out that he cleaned up once before. But certainly the determination is there. He bought a bottle of posh ginger beer from Sainsbury's the other day and took a swig and thought: 'This contains alcohol,' and looked at the label and found it was 0.05 per cent proof. So he went and poured it down the loo. </p> <p>He looks good on it, too - though altogether quieter than I have known him. But then, in the past, I've always known him in partying mode. This time he's at home, with his wife Deborah Orr, and their two-year-old son Ivan, and a book called Beyond Toddlerdom open on the sofa. The house is immaculate and surprisingly grand. He always says he lives in Vauxhall, which sounds rather raffish, but it's a lie - his house is in fashionable Stockwell and could feature in a design supplement any day. 'We live like kings!' he laughs. He does, too. Being married to Deborah Orr automatically makes him the envy of most male journalists in London. She is an unconventional beauty with great swags of tawny hair who was The Guardian Weekend editor and is now an award-winning columnist for The Independent . My colleague Euan Ferguson describes her as a 'proper tykey wee Motherwell bauchle,' which is evidently Scottish for a Good Thing. </p> <p>They married three years ago, and the marriage got off to a rocky start. Deborah was four months pregnant in April 1997 when Self was sacked from The Observer for taking drugs on John Major's plane. At the time, he was very loud and fierce in blaming The Observer; now he says demurely, 'I just blame myself. I mean, it was a shitty imbroglio and I put my disease at the centre of it all. Nobody at The Observer behaved badly. In fact, Will Hutton [the then editor] wrote and offered me money for treatment out of his own pocket, which I think was a saintly gesture.' The only person he remains furious with is Rosie Boycott, whom he claims betrayed him by printing a conversation in The Independent on Sunday which he thought was off the record. He will never speak to her again - 'But I wouldn't hire a hit man!' </p> <p>The dark suspicion at the time was that his heroin-taking was a stunt, that he was trying to 'do a Hunter S Thompson'. On the contrary, he says, he didn't give it a second thought. 'After all, at that point in my life I'd been taking heroin off and on for two decades - it was all in the day's work for me. In fact, the only thing that occurred to me - because I was smoking a lot of pot - was that I must stay downwind of the PM's special branch.' He spent what for him was a boring day covering Major's campaign in Derbyshire, filed his (perfectly coherent) copy, and thought no more about it. But apparently a Sunday Express man gleaned some gossip from Tory press minders, and cooked it up into a story. </p> <p>Self repeatedly told Hutton that there was no truth in the story, and Hutton went out to bat for him on that basis. But when Observer lawyers asked Self to sign an affidavit, he refused, and at that point Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief, sacked him. Self recalls the final scene at The Observer, with Rusbridger asking how he could lie to his editor for three days and himself thinking, 'I was doing class-A drugs at 17. I have lived the bulk of my adult life on the wrong side of the law, and you're asking me how I could have dared to tell a lie ?' </p> <p>Self's friends at the Groucho were disposed to cheer, regarding it as a heroic adventure. Self disagrees. He says the whole experience was horrible and humiliating - Deborah didn't eat for a week, neither of them slept, they had reporters camping on their doorstep, his older children (from his first marriage) heard gossip at school, it was all a nightmare. Indeed, he says solemnly: 'I do think I have a responsibility to point out, very clearly, that I don't think that my talents or my success as a writer have anything to do with my drug use or drinking. On the contrary, I've always had to fight against them in order to get any serious literary work done. So I think it is important for me to put that on the record. You know, drug addiction is as bad as your parents tell you it is. It really is.' </p> <p>Coo-er. This is the man who once said that telling people not to take drugs was like telling them not to breathe. But now he is eager to forget all that - he even claims that none of his writing ever glamourised drug use (oh come, Will!). When I mentioned that I loved his short story, Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys, he said he found it too poignant to re-read because, 'I realise now it's very much an anticipatory suicide note, written when I was struggling against alcoholism and really going under.' He rejects huge swathes of his past as tainted with addiction. Even his exciting pre-Deborah love life, when Tatler described him as 'the rock star of the literati with his own groupies', has been confined to the dustbin. Promiscuity, he says, was merely another symptom of his addictive personality - 'just a need to fix myself at a very primary level of feeling. And to gain the approbation and security of people being prepared to go to bed with me.' All his vastly complicated psychiatric history, in which he has been variously diagnosed as depressive, hypermanic, manic-depressive and even, when he was 19, borderline schizophrenic, can now be reduced to one simple diagnosis: 'I'm as sane as you are. But I am an addict.' </p> <p>This seems a tad simplistic. Even sober, he is a very dark and complex character, driven by strange guilts and fears and paranoias, unable to relax. Apart from all his other addictions he is a workaholic, who published eight books between 1991 and 1998, and probably wrote as much again in journalism. His current commitments include a weekly television review and occasional interviews (always with women) for The Independent on Sunday, a regular column for American GQ, and for the architects' paper Building Design, and a weekly 'essay' for the Today programme. He pops up on television arts programmes, and is currently doing an improbable stint as a 'live writer' in Jay Jopling's White Cube gallery. He is also writing a film script based on The Picture of Dorian Gray and a book about masculinity based on interviews with a woman-to-man transsexual ('We're just getting to his penis'). But all this is subsidiary to what he sees as his main job - writing fiction. </p> <p>Self's new novel, How the Dead Live, is literally 'long-awaited' - it was due out last year, but he was in no state to write it. He describes it now as 'the book that saved me'. It is written by a dead woman who is clearly his mother, and continues the theme of one of his first and greatest short stories, The North London Book of the Dead. But he has made one significant biographical change: he has given her two daughters (one of whom is a heroin addict) rather than three sons. Why? 'Well, I think partly, at the rather flip level, from a desire to recreate myself as a beautiful woman! Cocteau said that all artists are hermaphrodites, so I suppose there was a desire to maximise my feminine side. And again, Freud said that all art is wish-fulfilment and my mother had always wanted daughters. She didn't want sons and always had a very uneasy relationship with our masculinity.' </p> <p>Self seems to be actually haunted by his mother, who died of cancer in 1988. She was an unhappy woman, unmaternal, whom he describes as 'very loving and very aggressive'. After she died, he read her diaries and was shocked to find how coolly and critically she described her children. 'I think in the end she loved and disparaged us all equally. But I was the youngest and around her most, so I had the most intimate relationship with her by virtue of proximity.' His father, an LSE professor who first left home when Self was nine, was a remote and intimidating figure - 'a man who used dialectics the way the Japanese used bamboo slivers during the war'. The marriage was on, off, on, off for several years and ended in divorce when Self was 18. His cousin, Susannah Self, has recorded: 'There was a sense that the one thing that held together their difficult marriage was their total adoration of their little Willy. Day in, day out, they had nothing but pathological wonder for their incredibly naughty and difficult creation.' </p> <p>If he thought he had to be naughty to keep his parents' marriage intact, he certainly did his best - he started smoking dope at 12, was a regular in Hampstead pubs by 14, and first injected heroin at 17. When he went to Oxford to read PPE he was 'never for a second without some drug or other'. Mark Honigsbaum, who shared a flat with him in Oxford, recalls him in his final year 'holed up with Kant and a syringe'. He got a third. After that he devoted himself full time to being a junkie, till his mother paid for him to dry out in 1986. </p> <p>He was abstinent for three-and-a-half years, during which he worked for an industrial publisher, writing articles on deep-bore oil-well drilling. He survived his mother's death sober, but then started drinking again the next year. It was joy, not sorrow, that unhinged him. 'I was already wholly focused on literary ambition at that point - I really, really wanted to publish a book, that was my alpha and omega. My life up till then had really been a sort of brilliant mistake and I thought it would all be redeemed by having a book accepted. And when The Quantity Theory of Insanity was accepted in late '89, I felt I'd arrived, and all the brakes went off. I thought: \"Here I am, a proper citizen, I'm married, I've got a book coming out.\" So I didn't really believe what had been told to me - that I had an addictive disease that would never be cured.' </p> <p>By the time he arrived on the literary scene in 1991 - chosen as one of Granta 's Best Young British Novelists before he'd even published a novel - he was back on drugs and drink full time, and so he remained for most of the 90s. His pattern was to binge in London and then escape to the country - usually the Orkneys, which he loves - to clean up and write. But things started to go wrong in the summer of 1998 when he set off on one of his escapes and found he couldn't drive any more, he was too sick from drugs and blood-poisoning. His oldest friend, a consultant psychiatrist, managed to get him admitted to a private clinic, expecting him to be put in the drying-out ward. But Self fought that idea tooth and nail and persuaded the doctors that he was suffering from depression. 'So they put me on Prozac, which was ridiculous - I'm not a depressive. It made me completely mad, completely.' </p> <p>He was supposed to be delivering How the Dead Live in the autumn of 1998, but he missed that deadline, and the next. He knew he would have to be sober to write it, but he kept putting it off. In March last year, he achieved a DIY detox from hard drugs and booze, but he was still smoking enormous quantities of pot - 'A couple of Masai warriors had to pitch bales of the stuff into the basement every day.' Eventually he decided that only total abstinence would work and in October presented himself at an AA meeting, saying he was helpless in the face of addiction. 'I was 38 years old. I was in one shape or form addicted to drugs for nearly 20 years.' </p> <p>Then he went to the country and wrote How the Dead Live . Deborah had been urging him to do it fast - 'Do a bosh job, bosh, bosh, bosh, write a novella, fulfil your contract.' But in the end he wrote 400 pages. He says it was the hardest work he's ever done. In the past, he would write all day, stop at 7pm and reward himself with four Scotches and two joints then re-read what he'd written and go, 'Oh ha ha, that's quite good!' But with this one there was no reward. 'I couldn't get any zip going. And I didn't get any sense of completion until I was very near the end, when suddenly I could look back and see that it was working. But up till then I was in the dark wood.' Normally, he would celebrate the delivery of a manuscript by going on a bender. This time he took his seven-year-old daughter to buy presents in Hamleys. </p> <p>Many of his friends believe his drug problems over the past decade have been connected to guilt over the bitter break-up of his first marriage, to Kate Chancellor (sister of the actress Anna 'Duckface'), in 1993. He left his children, Alexis and Madeleine, when they were only two and six months. He has been a conscientious visiting father all these years, always turning up on the dot to collect them from school or take them swimming, however smashed or hungover he might be, but he admits, 'There's no doubt in my mind that my addiction has affected them - how can you be a good father when you're that self-destructive?' And he thinks it is no coincidence that he finally decided to sober up just when his children were becoming old enough to hear the gossip about their father. </p> <p>He says that obviously his life has changed with abstinence - though it was changing anyway, what with being married, having a new child and growing older. 'I have become just a helluva lot quieter. I don't go out much - I'm quite comfortable with that for the moment, but in due course I'd like to be a lot more sociable again. I just don't see anybody.' Oddly - for one who is so keen on women - he says he wishes he had more men friends, he wishes he'd kept a gang from school or university. But his drink and drugs - and the paranoia that went with them - gradually blew them all away. I know quite a few people who were friends with Will Self but had some terminal row with him. His current close friend is the writer Andrew O'Hagan - he and Deborah are going on holiday with him and his girlfriend India Knight - but Will says that even Andrew got fed up with him being 'fucking out to lunch'. </p> <p>Also, he is really too dazzling to be a good friend. I remember in 1995 taking an incredibly long train journey back from the Cheltenham Festival with Will and his then girlfriend, Victoria Hull. He was wildly entertaining, ranting on about all the contemporary writers he hates. But it was more like a performance than a conversation - and it went on for five hours. </p> <p>He is to some extent an actor; he knows it, and is troubled by it. 'There's a part of me that plays to the gallery and a part of me that would sooner slink underneath it and go home. I'm not so sure that the latter person isn't truer to my nature, but I'm quite confused about it. Deborah says it's vulgar to be famous - and I do have quite a lot of regrets about having a public profile which, for whatever reason, militates against the work being considered on its own merits.' </p> <p>This is a constant beef - that in Britain he's seen as a media performer first, and a novelist second. In America, it's the opposite - they treat him as a serious literary figure and call him 'Mr Self'. He gets very tetchy here when people say - as they often do - that they love his journalism and short stories but find his novels unreadable. This is a very sore topic indeed - when I raised it I suddenly saw a flash of the old Will, ranting on about people who were too lazy to read books. I got the same blistering when I said I wished he wouldn't use 'dictionary' words. He actually boasts that he uses a thesaurus and that, 'To me, a writer saying he doesn't use one is like a mechanic saying he doesn't use a socket set.' </p> <p>But what's the point of using words that have no life outside a dictionary? I think the explanation is that he has an inferiority complex about his literary credentials - he read PPE at university, not Eng Lit, and says that the difference between him and Martin Amis is that Amis is a 'writer's writer', steeped in literature, whereas he writes 'novels of ideas'. He puts his writing manifesto on the cover of How the Dead Live: 'I don't write fiction for people to identify with and I don't write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people.' For me, it sums up the fatal flaw in his fiction - a certain condescension in his attitude to the reader. He wants to dazzle and astonish more than he wants to communicate. </p> <p>Whereas his journalism, I think, is brilliant - just as dazzling but mercifully shorter and cushioned by the surrounding stodge. I love his interviews for The Independent on Sunday , but am also quite relieved to note their diminishing frequency, which he explains is because 'My subjects are becoming distinctly elusive - my quarry is scampering over the veldt ahead of my gun!' He likes interviewing women because he thinks he's somehow reconnecting with his mother. But there is no doubt in his mind that his journalism is secondary to his fiction - 'Fiction is where I really find myself as a writer. It's the mother lode. It's where I get my jollies.' </p> <p>Next year, he thinks he might give up journalism to concentrate entirely on novels. He wants to write bigger novels - 'Bigger canvas, longer time span, more characters and more gearing into the world. In my twenties and thirties, I had that kind of fashionable deconstructionist view that it was meaningless to write about what characters thought because it was such an artificial construct - and I think in my case that was also a reflection of my own immaturity. But the interesting thing about middle age is that you begin to see how people change over time, and how they change in relation to social change, and you begin to get an inkling of why the 19th-century novelists were so preoccupied by this phenomenon. It requires a big canvas and a lot of space and a lot of oomph to bring it off, and I'm really interested in doing it.' </p> <p>Is he confident that he can stay clean? 'Today, yes, today. I don't know for the future, but I sincerely hope so because - I don't want to be melodramatic about it but I don't need to be - it fucking nearly killed me. And I love my life and I love my wife, I love my children, and I love such friends as I've managed to keep despite the disease, and I don't want to spoil that. But it's pointless to make pledges for the future - it's about dealing with the day.' </p> <p>\u0095 How the Dead Live (Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99) is published on 22 June</p>",

All his vastly complicated psychiatric history, in which he has been variously diagnosed as depressive, hypermanic, manic-depressive and even, when he was 19, borderline schizophrenic, can now be reduced to one simple diagnosis: 'I'm as sane as you are. But I am an addict.' This seems a tad simplistic. Even sober, he is a very dark and complex character, driven by strange guilts and fears and paranoias, unable to relax. Apart from all his other addictions he is a workaholic, who published eight books between 1991 and 1998, and probably wrote as much again in journalism. His current commitments include a weekly television review and occasional interviews (always with women) for The Independent on Sunday, a regular column for American GQ, and for the architects' paper Building Design, and a weekly 'essay' for the Today programme. He pops up on television arts programmes, and is currently doing an improbable stint as a 'live writer' in Jay Jopling's White Cube gallery. He is also writing a film script based on The Picture of Dorian Gray and a book about masculinity based on interviews with a woman-to-man transsexual ('We're just getting to his penis'). But all this is subsidiary to what he sees as his main job - writing fiction. Self's new novel, How the Dead Live, is literally 'long-awaited' - it was due out last year, but he was in no state to write it. He describes it now as 'the book that saved me'. It is written by a dead woman who is clearly his mother, and continues the theme of one of his first and greatest short stories, The North London Book of the Dead. But he has made one significant biographical change: he has given her two daughters (one of whom is a heroin addict) rather than three sons. Why? 'Well, I think partly, at the rather flip level, from a desire to recreate myself as a beautiful woman! Cocteau said that all artists are hermaphrodites, so I suppose there was a desire to maximise my feminine side. And again, Freud said that all art is wish-fulfilment and my mother had always wanted daughters. She didn't want sons and always had a very uneasy relationship with our masculinity.' Self seems to be actually haunted by his mother, who died of cancer in 1988. She was an unhappy woman, unmaternal, whom he describes as 'very loving and very aggressive'. After she died, he read her diaries and was shocked to find how coolly and critically she described her children. 'I think in the end she loved and disparaged us all equally. But I was the youngest and around her most, so I had the most intimate relationship with her by virtue of proximity.' His father, an LSE professor who first left home when Self was nine, was a remote and intimidating figure - 'a man who used dialectics the way the Japanese used bamboo slivers during the war'. The marriage was on, off, on, off for several years and ended in divorce when Self was 18. His cousin, Susannah Self, has recorded: 'There was a sense that the one thing that held together their difficult marriage was their total adoration of their little Willy. Day in, day out, they had nothing but pathological wonder for their incredibly naughty and difficult creation.' If he thought he had to be naughty to keep his parents' marriage intact, he certainly did his best - he started smoking dope at 12, was a regular in Hampstead pubs by 14, and first injected heroin at 17. When he went to Oxford to read PPE he was 'never for a second without some drug or other'. Mark Honigsbaum, who shared a flat with him in Oxford, recalls him in his final year 'holed up with Kant and a syringe'. He got a third. After that he devoted himself full time to being a junkie, till his mother paid for him to dry out in 1986. He was abstinent for three-and-a-half years, during which he worked for an industrial publisher, writing articles on deep-bore oil-well drilling. He survived his mother's death sober, but then started drinking again the next year. It was joy, not sorrow, that unhinged him. 'I was already wholly focused on literary ambition at that point - I really, really wanted to publish a book, that was my alpha and omega. My life up till then had really been a sort of brilliant mistake and I thought it would all be redeemed by having a book accepted. And when The Quantity Theory of Insanity was accepted in late '89, I felt I'd arrived, and all the brakes went off. I thought: \"Here I am, a proper citizen, I'm married, I've got a book coming out.\" So I didn't really believe what had been told to me - that I had an addictive disease that would never be cured.' By the time he arrived on the literary scene in 1991 - chosen as one of Granta 's Best Young British Novelists before he'd even published a novel - he was back on drugs and drink full time, and so he remained for most of the 90s. His pattern was to binge in London and then escape to the country - usually the Orkneys, which he loves - to clean up and write. But things started to go wrong in the summer of 1998 when he set off on one of his escapes and found he couldn't drive any more, he was too sick from drugs and blood-poisoning. His oldest friend, a consultant psychiatrist, managed to get him admitted to a private clinic, expecting him to be put in the drying-out ward. But Self fought that idea tooth and nail and persuaded the doctors that he was suffering from depression. 'So they put me on Prozac, which was ridiculous - I'm not a depressive. It made me completely mad, completely.' He was supposed to be delivering How the Dead Live in the autumn of 1998, but he missed that deadline, and the next. He knew he would have to be sober to write it, but he kept putting it off. In March last year, he achieved a DIY detox from hard drugs and booze, but he was still smoking enormous quantities of pot - 'A couple of Masai warriors had to pitch bales of the stuff into the basement every day.' Eventually he decided that only total abstinence would work and in October presented himself at an AA meeting, saying he was helpless in the face of addiction. 'I was 38 years old. I was in one shape or form addicted to drugs for nearly 20 years.' Then he went to the country and wrote How the Dead Live . Deborah had been urging him to do it fast - 'Do a bosh job, bosh, bosh, bosh, write a novella, fulfil your contract.' But in the end he wrote 400 pages. He says it was the hardest work he's ever done. In the past, he would write all day, stop at 7pm and reward himself with four Scotches and two joints then re-read what he'd written and go, 'Oh ha ha, that's quite good!' But with this one there was no reward. 'I couldn't get any zip going. And I didn't get any sense of completion until I was very near the end, when suddenly I could look back and see that it was working. But up till then I was in the dark wood.' Normally, he would celebrate the delivery of a manuscript by going on a bender. This time he took his seven-year-old daughter to buy presents in Hamleys. Many of his friends believe his drug problems over the past decade have been connected to guilt over the bitter break-up of his first marriage, to Kate Chancellor (sister of the actress Anna 'Duckface'), in 1993. He left his children, Alexis and Madeleine, when they were only two and six months. He has been a conscientious visiting father all these years, always turning up on the dot to collect them from school or take them swimming, however smashed or hungover he might be, but he admits, 'There's no doubt in my mind that my addiction has affected them - how can you be a good father when you're that self-destructive?' And he thinks it is no coincidence that he finally decided to sober up just when his children were becoming old enough to hear the gossip about their father. He says that obviously his life has changed with abstinence - though it was changing anyway, what with being married, having a new child and growing older. 'I have become just a helluva lot quieter. I don't go out much - I'm quite comfortable with that for the moment, but in due course I'd like to be a lot more sociable again. I just don't see anybody.' Oddly - for one who is so keen on women - he says he wishes he had more men friends, he wishes he'd kept a gang from school or university. But his drink and drugs - and the paranoia that went with them - gradually blew them all away. I know quite a few people who were friends with Will Self but had some terminal row with him. His current close friend is the writer Andrew O'Hagan - he and Deborah are going on holiday with him and his girlfriend India Knight - but Will says that even Andrew got fed up with him being 'fucking out to lunch'. Also, he is really too dazzling to be a good friend. I remember in 1995 taking an incredibly long train journey back from the Cheltenham Festival with Will and his then girlfriend, Victoria Hull. He was wildly entertaining, ranting on about all the contemporary writers he hates. But it was more like a performance than a conversation - and it went on for five hours. He is to some extent an actor; he knows it, and is troubled by it. 'There's a part of me that plays to the gallery and a part of me that would sooner slink underneath it and go home. I'm not so sure that the latter person isn't truer to my nature, but I'm quite confused about it. Deborah says it's vulgar to be famous - and I do have quite a lot of regrets about having a public profile which, for whatever reason, militates against the work being considered on its own merits.' This is a constant beef - that in Britain he's seen as a media performer first, and a novelist second. In America, it's the opposite - they treat him as a serious literary figure and call him 'Mr Self'. He gets very tetchy here when people say - as they often do - that they love his journalism and short stories but find his novels unreadable. This is a very sore topic indeed - when I raised it I suddenly saw a flash of the old Will, ranting on about people who were too lazy to read books. I got the same blistering when I said I wished he wouldn't use 'dictionary' words. He actually boasts that he uses a thesaurus and that, 'To me, a writer saying he doesn't use one is like a mechanic saying he doesn't use a socket set.' But what's the point of using words that have no life outside a dictionary? I think the explanation is that he has an inferiority complex about his literary credentials - he read PPE at university, not Eng Lit, and says that the difference between him and Martin Amis is that Amis is a 'writer's writer', steeped in literature, whereas he writes 'novels of ideas'. He puts his writing manifesto on the cover of How the Dead Live: 'I don't write fiction for people to identify with and I don't write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people.' For me, it sums up the fatal flaw in his fiction - a certain condescension in his attitude to the reader. He wants to dazzle and astonish more than he wants to communicate. Whereas his journalism, I think, is brilliant - just as dazzling but mercifully shorter and cushioned by the surrounding stodge. I love his interviews for The Independent on Sunday , but am also quite relieved to note their diminishing frequency, which he explains is because 'My subjects are becoming distinctly elusive - my quarry is scampering over the veldt ahead of my gun!' He likes interviewing women because he thinks he's somehow reconnecting with his mother. But there is no doubt in his mind that his journalism is secondary to his fiction - 'Fiction is where I really find myself as a writer. It's the mother lode. It's where I get my jollies.' Next year, he thinks he might give up journalism to concentrate entirely on novels. He wants to write bigger novels - 'Bigger canvas, longer time span, more characters and more gearing into the world. In my twenties and thirties, I had that kind of fashionable deconstructionist view that it was meaningless to write about what characters thought because it was such an artificial construct - and I think in my case that was also a reflection of my own immaturity. But the interesting thing about middle age is that you begin to see how people change over time, and how they change in relation to social change, and you begin to get an inkling of why the 19th-century novelists were so preoccupied by this phenomenon. It requires a big canvas and a lot of space and a lot of oomph to bring it off, and I'm really interested in doing it.' Is he confident that he can stay clean? 'Today, yes, today. I don't know for the future, but I sincerely hope so because - I don't want to be melodramatic about it but I don't need to be - it fucking nearly killed me. And I love my life and I love my wife, I love my children, and I love such friends as I've managed to keep despite the disease, and I don't want to spoil that. But it's pointless to make pledges for the future - it's about dealing with the day.' \u0095 How the Dead Live (Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99) is published on 22 June",

So it's important that you start imposing restrictions. I think you have to start with a simple fact: that there are 52 weeks in a year, and that you have to have four weeks holiday, four weeks preparation for the season, and two weeks that you say, 'It's raining,' or 'it's snowing,' or 'it's [pause] Christmas' or, yes, whatever. Well, that leaves 42 weeks, and you can play, say, one and a half games a week. That's, say, 65 games. And then you can give maximum quality, because what's lacking now is quality. The quality is going down because there is too much football.</p> <p> <strong>SK The Champions League is a scandal in that respect, isn't it? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Absolutely. Ridiculous. It's much too much. Everything is too much.</p> <p> <strong>SK Is the European Championship as important as it used to be, or has it been devalued by the increase in club football? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> I think it has to be important. You have to make it very important. Look, I am professional enough to know that money matters, but a national team is a national interest. And you as a club have to cooperate with that. So you don't need eight foreigners in your team.</p> <p>I think that, just as wingers died out in England, you now have to prevent national teams from dying out. All borders have already gone, or are going, or are half gone. You don't need a passport any more, or a lot less than before. OK. I don't mind that at all. You all have the same currency. Also not a problem at all. But isn't it wonderful that you can see your own national team play? What is there against that?</p> <p> <strong>SK But haven't you become a European? You've lived half your life outside Holland. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> I am and always will be a Dutchman, for the very simple reason: I have the Dutch mentality. [Laughs.] I don't have a Spanish mentality or a German or an Italian. Just be pleased that we have so many different beautiful mentalities. And go to work with them. That's culture. It's what you take from history.</p> <p> <strong>SK Which players have you particularly enjoyed watching this season? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Well, there's several players who have that. I've really enjoyed Luis Figo, I've enjoyed that, that Shevchenko, what's he called, from, eh, Milan. And that, that Veron. Couple of good things. That Salas at first. Yes, of course those are nice things. You've enjoyed that, eh, that Yorke in the beginning.</p> <p>So of course these are snapshots. But yes, there are some footballers who I simply like. Owen a little less because he has had a lot of injuries.</p> <p>But those are people of whom you say: 'Hey, well, yes, you watch them.' I think for instance someone who can defend well, if I see Jaap Stam defending, I think that's attractive too. How he does it, and what he does. And yes, mistakes or not, there are nice things in that.</p> <p> <strong>SK I want to ask you about the Dutch team. It's not a Cruyffian side, as they play without wingers, and... </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> No, first of all, responsible for that team is Frank Rijkaard. He has his own way of seeing things. Well, you have to appreciate that. But I've always said that if we play differently from the others we have more chances, because we do have more initiative.</p> <p> <strong>SK Holland's playing style originated with you. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> It happened midway through the Sixties. I was the second full professional in Holland, in 1964 I think. Think about it: it hasn't existed that long. Piet Keizer was the first, I was the second. Half the players trained in the evenings and the other half during the day. Well, that hadn't happened in England since the Fifties.</p> <p>And yes, I thought English football with wingers was fantastic. Stanley Matthews and so on. That was gigantic, eh? And at some point, through certain ideas, that changed. And I don't agree with that change. I think the wing is one of the most beautiful positions. People who can play there... it's a delight to see them. If you see someone like Figo you say: 'Guys, that's beautiful.'</p> <p> <strong>SK Figo is a winger after your heart. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> For instance, yes. Can do everything: can cross, can cut inside, can shoot with his right or left. Yes, he really has everything. And of course there are others. Dennis Bergkamp always played outside-right.</p> <p> <strong>SK Do you think he could do that again? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Oh, everyone can do it. Why not? If you have the qualities. And it's the most beautiful position because you can have a great time dribbling, if you position yourself rightly. You're always playing one against one, you can create so much space for your team. Yes, I always loved that spot. I almost always began on a wing.</p> <p> <strong>SK You often went down the left and then... </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Left, hop. I began from there.</p> <p> <strong>SK What has happened to Bergkamp? In recent years he has become a 'moments footballer' with very few moments. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, but that's a consequence of football today. I remember when I was being brought up in the past, they said: 'Hey, forwards aren't allowed to run. Calm down. All your strength for the decisive action.' Nowadays there isn't a person on the pitch who runs as much as a forward. Diving into the gaps, running, pulling, you name it. It's totally different. I prefer the other way.</p> <p> <strong>SK But surely Patrick Kluivert is a hard-working centre-forward, not Bergkamp? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, that could be. But I mean, Bergkamp, he could be one of the ones from the past. Like [Marco] Van Basten, Romario. Isn't it a waste if Romario runs himself silly from left to right? He should be somewhere near the penalty area and get everything out of that that he can.</p> <p> <strong>SK So you think it's fine that Bergkamp stands there doing nothing for ages and then... </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Oh, that depends. But then you have to adjust your style of play. Of course you can also play with two strikers. But then you have to show a high rate of return. Romario stood still, but he has a high rate of return. They have to think about return, you know. But with me a beautiful footballer always has an advantage.</p> <p> <strong>SK So you give Bergkamp the benefit of the doubt, or... </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Always. But of course he has to show a return. You have to keep us Dutchmen awake or else we go weak. Well, in England they don't do that, so Bergkamp will have moments of weakening. You mustn't see that as a failing. That's just the way we Dutch are.</p> <p> <strong>SK Bergkamp has landed up on the Dutch bench once or twice recently. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, the returns weren't there. So many similar players, drawn games. Yes, then you'll have to change.</p> <p> <strong>SK Kluivert has developed terrifically. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> In part. He did well against Belgium, or against Germany, against Czechoslovakia and so on. It's all drawn matches, of course that's not much cop.</p> <p> <strong>SK But he plays well at Barcelona, doesn't he? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, but that's not the Dutch team.</p> <p> <strong>SK No, but... </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> As a striker he has developed well, but I've known Kluivert since he was nine or ten years old [holds his hand a couple of feet above the floor]. So: surprising, surprising, well no.</p> <p> <strong>SK You always saw it in him. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Saw him coming, and you saw his development, and of course football nowadays is much more physical, and that suits him perfectly. Well, apart from his physique he has a lot of vision and a reasonable-to- good technique.</p> <p>Had he played in a different era, he would have found it more difficult, because there was less space then and so the level of play was technically better.</p> <p> <strong>SK If you see Holland now, does it make your heart leap? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> No, not yet, not yet.</p> <p> <strong>SK But I mean, do you watch as a fan? Do you hope Holland will win? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, of course. Particularly since all those boys have well, all is exaggerated, but almost all of them made their debuts with me [when Cruyff was manager of Ajax]. Or were with me, or had to do with me, or I don't know what in some way or another. That's all nice, isn't it? I just hope people do well.</p> <p> <strong>SK Holland always lose on penalties - the last two Europeans; the last World Cup. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> A Dutchman likes doing something beautifully. But if you have to take a penalty after the match, work it out: you've already played a match, you've played extra time, so in principle you're walking on your last legs, you can't go on, and then you try to hit the penalty beautifully! In that situation you should just run up, eyes shut, and shoot.</p> <p> <strong>SK Against Brazil at the World Cup, Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer missed penalties they took with the inside of the foot. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, those are things that can't be done after two hours of football, you don't have an inside any more. Then it's a case of: close down your brain, don't look [mimes blasting a penalty-kick].</p> <p> <strong>SK Did you ever take a crucial penalty? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, of course you take a penalty occasionally, because it happens, but we had specialists. I wasn't a specialist. At Ajax it was Gerrit Muhren, at Barcelona there was [Carles] Rexach, and they just stood there with the ball and well, [Ronald] Koeman. Recently Koeman. Well, of the ten penalties eleven went in. So that was never a problem.</p> <p> <strong>SK Holland have just switched from white shorts to black ones, the colour they wore in the Seventies. Do you approve? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, no problem. I think it has a certain impact. Orange is a difficult colour. So you have to have a very good orange shirt because it has to emit something.</p> <p> <strong>SK Very bright orange. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes, has to be very orange. Particularly if it gets sweaty. It mustn't go dead. That's a problem in itself, you know. I played here at Barcelona, they had blue-and-red shirts, and it depends on the material, but when those boys began sweating, you could still see them from the stands, because you were seeing them against the green pitch. </p> <p>But if you're on the pitch, and you're looking towards the stands, because that's your eyeline, and you saw that blue and red and it was dark with sweat, you couldn't see anyone standing there. And then the people in the stands said, 'What, can't you see him?' No, no, I really didn't see him.</p> <p>So, the first thing I did when I came here as manager was to find a shirt made of a material (by the way: not that I know anything about materials) that you could say, 'Hey, if someone's sweating, I want to be able to see him.'</p> <p>Another thing I did at Barcelona: I wanted our second colour to be an orange shirt, aggressive orange. So that if we went somewhere nobody could think: 'Who are those guys?' That's us. And the colour orange is fantastic for that. </p> <p>For the Dutch team too. Awing the opposition is the best thing there is, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>SK So if a team like Germany, or Bayern Munich, play in grey</strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> No, I don't like that. Rubbish. Barcelona's change kit is grey now. What is that? [Sniffs.] Not colours for me.</p> <p> <strong>SK While Euro 2000 is on, will you be able to walk around in Amsterdam? </strong></p> <p><strong>JC</strong> Yes! I find it pleasant everywhere, never have trouble. Never trouble anywhere.</p> <p> <strong>SK</strong> Thank you very much for the interview. </p> <p>JC OK. I'm going to watch the second half. Real Madrid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When he is not travelling around Europe watching games, he sits in the television room of his Barcelona mansion channel-hopping from match to match. At 53, he still plays quite often. One recent evening the man voted European Player of the Twentieth Century tried to go cold turkey. With Champions League matches on TV in the other room, and his daughter popping in occasionally to relay scores, he talked at length to The Observer. Thankfully the topic was football, and Euro 2000 in particular. Cruyff talked and talked and talked in his own unique language. (One crucial rule: he often uses the word 'you' to refer to himself.) Along the way, he explained how to score in a penalty shoot-out. The moment the interview ended, he dashed back to the television room. SK Are you looking forward to Euro 2000 - yet another big football tournament, or is the football diet too rich? JC There's much too much football. So it's important that you start imposing restrictions. I think you have to start with a simple fact: that there are 52 weeks in a year, and that you have to have four weeks holiday, four weeks preparation for the season, and two weeks that you say, 'It's raining,' or 'it's snowing,' or 'it's [pause] Christmas' or, yes, whatever. Well, that leaves 42 weeks, and you can play, say, one and a half games a week. That's, say, 65 games. And then you can give maximum quality, because what's lacking now is quality. The quality is going down because there is too much football. SK The Champions League is a scandal in that respect, isn't it? JC Absolutely. Ridiculous. It's much too much. Everything is too much. SK Is the European Championship as important as it used to be, or has it been devalued by the increase in club football? JC I think it has to be important. You have to make it very important. Look, I am professional enough to know that money matters, but a national team is a national interest. And you as a club have to cooperate with that. So you don't need eight foreigners in your team. I think that, just as wingers died out in England, you now have to prevent national teams from dying out. All borders have already gone, or are going, or are half gone.

      "body": "<p>Somewhere in the back of the minds of 352 professional footballers recently arrived in the Low Countries lurks the same fantasy: Rotterdam, 2 July, around 7.55 in the evening local time, and there they are standing tall, breathing deep, the sound of their own national anthem filling the air, about to play the Euro 2000 final. </p> <p>Luis Figo has thought about this moment. He wants it to be Portugal against Spain. His country - naturally - against the country where he plays his football, who happen to be his tip for the tournament. No guessing the outcome of his imagined dream final. 'We will win,' he announces, although his bravado is diluted by a grinning dose of self mockery. He knows the prospect of Portugal rising above 15 of Europe's finest is a joke in most people's eyes.</p> <p>For a decade Portugal have been classic underachievers. Figo belongs to a golden generation, an exceptional group crowned the best in Europe at under-17 level and World Champions at under-20. With the inventive Rui Costa and the twinkle-toed Joao Pinto, when they joined up with Vitor Baia, Fernando Couto and Paolo Sousa (who were only a year or so older than the wonderkids) in the senior squad, Portugal expected years of greatness. Instead people have been scratching their heads to work out why they haven't matured as an international force. </p> <p>Each of them has proof of glittering club careers at home on mantelpieces laden with prizes. As for the national team, well, they didn't even qualify for the last World Cup. Figo is not alone believing the time has come for the golden generation to prove their worth in the red and green. This summer is, according to Sousa, 'the moment of truth.' </p> <p>They are the most talented squad in Group A when it comes to pure technique and imagination. But they can also be the most over-elaborate, which was their undoing last time around at Euro 96. Coach Humberto Coelho, whose steadying leadership qualities have made Portugal a more compact, disciplined unit, has concentrated on adding toughness to a game plan that depended on trickery. </p> <p>For the perfect example he needs look no further than his captain, Figo. Those daring, creative raids down Barcelona's right have made him the most hacked down player in La Liga, but, intriguingly, he also commits the most fouls. He seems at ease with his volatile temperament: 'I'm a calm person off the pitch but I'm very aggressive on it. You have to be.' Supporters at the Nou Camp cherish Rivaldo but they love Figo more, because he always gives everything. </p> <p>Considering he's both an idol and an artist he has very few prima-donna tendencies (save the occasional theatrical dives). With Pep Guardiola absent from the team for much of last season Figo was handed the captaincy but such is his modesty he would only refer to himself as vice-captain. In spite of soaring popularity, responsibility and fame he remains level headed, kind, genuine. </p> <p>He sometimes goes horse riding or plays golf to relax. He spends time with his Swedish girlfriend, a model, and their year-old daughter. Figo is happy living in Barcelona, and seems contented enough to see out the remaining four years of his contract even through transfer speculation has been rife since manager Louis van Gaal left town. </p> <p>With a buy-out clause put at up to \u00a331.5 million the Catalans would make a considerable profit on the arch-creator they bought for only \u00a31.5 million from Sporting Lisbon. Back then, in 1995, he was cheap because a move to Serie A collapsed in controversy when he and his agent signed contracts with two different clubs and he was banned from playing in Italy for two years. Just think, at the time Manchester City tried to sneak in when Brian Horton had a vision of this young, little-known Portuguese called Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo linking up with rising England starlet Garry Flitcroft... </p> <p>He has always been coveted, since childhood in the 'Os Pastilhas' district of Lisbon, dribbling and tormenting his pals on sandy playgrounds until he was spotted by Sporting, the club his father supported. There would be uproar if Figo was allowed to leave Barcelona now. He is 27 and enjoying those radiant moments when an athlete's levels of energy and experience exist in perfect harmony. </p> <p>Be it Phil Neville or Gareth Barry, Dennis Wise or Steve McManaman, whoever undertakes the burden of patrolling England's dreaded left side when England make their first foray into Euro 2000 will be hoping upon hope Figo is shunted to the other side and out of harm's way.

      "bodyText": "Somewhere in the back of the minds of 352 professional footballers recently arrived in the Low Countries lurks the same fantasy: Rotterdam, 2 July, around 7.55 in the evening local time, and there they are standing tall, breathing deep, the sound of their own national anthem filling the air, about to play the Euro 2000 final. Luis Figo has thought about this moment. He wants it to be Portugal against Spain. His country - naturally - against the country where he plays his football, who happen to be his tip for the tournament. No guessing the outcome of his imagined dream final. 'We will win,' he announces, although his bravado is diluted by a grinning dose of self mockery. He knows the prospect of Portugal rising above 15 of Europe's finest is a joke in most people's eyes. For a decade Portugal have been classic underachievers. Figo belongs to a golden generation, an exceptional group crowned the best in Europe at under-17 level and World Champions at under-20. With the inventive Rui Costa and the twinkle-toed Joao Pinto, when they joined up with Vitor Baia, Fernando Couto and Paolo Sousa (who were only a year or so older than the wonderkids) in the senior squad, Portugal expected years of greatness. Instead people have been scratching their heads to work out why they haven't matured as an international force. Each of them has proof of glittering club careers at home on mantelpieces laden with prizes. As for the national team, well, they didn't even qualify for the last World Cup. Figo is not alone believing the time has come for the golden generation to prove their worth in the red and green. This summer is, according to Sousa, 'the moment of truth.' They are the most talented squad in Group A when it comes to pure technique and imagination. But they can also be the most over-elaborate, which was their undoing last time around at Euro 96. Coach Humberto Coelho, whose steadying leadership qualities have made Portugal a more compact, disciplined unit, has concentrated on adding toughness to a game plan that depended on trickery. For the perfect example he needs look no further than his captain, Figo. Those daring, creative raids down Barcelona's right have made him the most hacked down player in La Liga, but, intriguingly, he also commits the most fouls. He seems at ease with his volatile temperament: 'I'm a calm person off the pitch but I'm very aggressive on it. You have to be.' Supporters at the Nou Camp cherish Rivaldo but they love Figo more, because he always gives everything. Considering he's both an idol and an artist he has very few prima-donna tendencies (save the occasional theatrical dives). With Pep Guardiola absent from the team for much of last season Figo was handed the captaincy but such is his modesty he would only refer to himself as vice-captain. In spite of soaring popularity, responsibility and fame he remains level headed, kind, genuine. He sometimes goes horse riding or plays golf to relax. He spends time with his Swedish girlfriend, a model, and their year-old daughter. Figo is happy living in Barcelona, and seems contented enough to see out the remaining four years of his contract even through transfer speculation has been rife since manager Louis van Gaal left town. With a buy-out clause put at up to \u00a331.5 million the Catalans would make a considerable profit on the arch-creator they bought for only \u00a31.5 million from Sporting Lisbon. Back then, in 1995, he was cheap because a move to Serie A collapsed in controversy when he and his agent signed contracts with two different clubs and he was banned from playing in Italy for two years. Just think, at the time Manchester City tried to sneak in when Brian Horton had a vision of this young, little-known Portuguese called Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo linking up with rising England starlet Garry Flitcroft... He has always been coveted, since childhood in the 'Os Pastilhas' district of Lisbon, dribbling and tormenting his pals on sandy playgrounds until he was spotted by Sporting, the club his father supported. There would be uproar if Figo was allowed to leave Barcelona now. He is 27 and enjoying those radiant moments when an athlete's levels of energy and experience exist in perfect harmony. Be it Phil Neville or Gareth Barry, Dennis Wise or Steve McManaman, whoever undertakes the burden of patrolling England's dreaded left side when England make their first foray into Euro 2000 will be hoping upon hope Figo is shunted to the other side and out of harm's way. In a recent warm-up match against Italy he switched flanks and away from his favoured right side. That, for a team as tilted as England, would be a blessing. But not much. Players possessing his bewildering brand of skills are a danger anywhere. Anyway, it would be naive to assume Coelho hasn't spotted England's most exploitable weakness and won't position his most potent weapon accordingly. Figo believes it will be a close run thing between all the group contenders: 'England practise a more European style of football now,' he says. 'They have very good players who play in some of Europe's greatest teams and they are great going forward. I like Paul Scholes, Alan Shearer and David Beckham, they are all players who could do us harm. They had difficulty in qualifying but will be strong at Euro 2000. 'Germany are in transformation.

'In the past we haven't played enough as a team, we've been too individualistic. We tend to play well against strong teams but sometimes underperform against weaker ones,' admits Figo. 'But we can get it right now and we can go all the way at Euro 2000. Portugal can win it. Why not? We have the ability and we have a lot of hope.'",

The eye is drawn to him even though Richard Branson should dominate the room.</p> <p>Just around the corner in the hall are such luminaries as the Alans, Ayckbourn and Bennett, and Sir Elton John, along with someone he will certainly recognise in Paul Smith. In a room across the corridor, Seamus Heaney, bearing a striking resemblance to Tommy Docherty, looks as if he is holding court. Posh and the girls are in another ante-chamber, laughing (all except Geri), perhaps at Gilbert and George, who strut nearby in all their manhood. </p> <p>This is the ground floor of the newly extended National Portrait Gallery and a moody black and white study of David Beckham has duly taken its place amid the nation's significant figures since 1990. It is a picture, by Lorenzo Agius, who was also responsible for the street-cred poster of Trainspotting, that does genuinely say much about Beckham, both as professional and person.</p> <p>The hair is carefully unkempt - as Dolly Parton once said: 'It costs a lot of money to look this cheap' - and just one eye peers through the locks. Beckham himself has said, forlornly in these voracious media shark-tank days: 'All I want to be known as is a great footballer.' There is both a shyness and steeliness in the gaze. The wispy beard and moustache suggest full maturity still to come. The right side of his face is in shadow. We have indeed seen a dark side.</p> <p>Today, Middle England seems to be passing through. 'He looks better like that than with that awful skinhead cut,' says one handbag to her fellow blue-rinsed day-out companion. You can bet that Beckham's mum, once a hairdresser, has told him as much herself but kids today, eh? It made the bulletins not long ago when it was announced that Beckham would be replacing Lady Thatcher, who was to be kicked upstairs to the 1960-90 section of the gallery.</p> <p> Actually, he didn't oust her. Any other newly fashionable figure could have been seized upon. It is just that Beckham has become a modern icon for use in headlines, neatly twinned as he is with a celebrity wife. Two for the price of fame of one.</p> <p>The problem was that of the former Posh and Becks figures, Paul Gascoigne - no sign of his portrait here - shot his bolt and Princess Diana proved mortal. When Gazza recently admitted that he was once sent home from training when in Glasgow with Rangers for being drunk, it merited a paragraph or two. Tell us something we hadn't guessed. A successor from the new showbusiness that is English football was needed. The problem is that Beckham does not really conform to the flawed-genius figure so prevalent in football's, sport's, and life's modern era.</p> <p>So the boy and his missus buy a Hertfordshire South Fork. So he spends \u00a3300 on a haircut that yer average suits-you-sir barber would have done for a fiver. So he drives his Ferrari a bit too fast now and then. So he has the name of the baby he dotes on tattooed on his back, an angel added to watch over Brooklyn. So he likes the odd fashion show and has been a victim of the sarong. And, snigger, snigger, his wife, wearing her mouth on the sleeve of her little Gucci number, has revealed that he has been known to don her underwear. Thongs ain't what they used to be.</p> <p>He was sent off against Argentina in that World Cup match in France 98, though, wasn't he? And he has reacted angrily to some verbal abuse from the cheap seats hasn't he? The boy can have a bit of a temper on him, as well. Heinous crimes in these black-and-white, tabloid times. The drawback is that he drinks only the odd beer and likes nothing better than a Saturday night in front of Blind Date with Posh and pizza. It is a red-top shame that he genuinely seems head-over-heels in love with Victoria. And when he did have a spat with Sir Alex Ferguson, leading to his being dropped from the Manchester United team to play Leeds after missing training twice in a week, it was all over in a few days.</p> <p>As frenzied speculation mounted that he was under the thumb of his wife, who was supposedly involved in a battle of wills with Sir Alex Ferguson, Beckham simply swallowed his pride, declared that United had always been his club, having been given it by his father Ted (not that one), and got back to doing what he does best: being a footballer.</p> <p>And it is that - what a relief - to which the nation turns it lonely eyes for Euro 2000. It is hard to see Kevin Keegan ignoring those wicked, curling crosses, free kicks and corners for England's opening game against Portugal in Eindhoven tomorrow night the way the idiosyncratic Glenn Hoddle did at the start of France 98.</p> <p>The next few weeks will determine whether that experience, and St Etienne, proved formatively valuable, on the gain-through-pain principle, and whether we concern ourselves with what David Beckham really is about or whether all the peripherals of celebrity/notoriety intrude anew.</p> <p>This time, Beckham is coming into a tournament refreshed by a holiday rather than stressed out by Manchester United's duel with Arsenal in 1998 and tension at England's training camp. This time, though at 25 he is still two or three years from his peak, he has honed the game and has developed the temperament to make amends for 30 June, 1998. Any repeat of the first of only two red cards in his career and the phone-in lines will hum with more personal name-callers.</p> <p>It was certainly a key period in the life and career of David Beckham, as he himself has recognised going into the subsequent major championship. 'I know I have a short fuse at times but I don't think what went on against Argentina will happen again,' he insists. 'It has made me stronger mentally.'</p> <p>'In hindsight, it was an accident waiting to happen,' recalls his team-mate Graeme Le Saux of the episode. 'The whole World Cup and before at La Manga, you could see the frustration in him building up. </p> <p>'He was away from his girlfriend and coupled with things that were said and which happened it was very difficult for him, although he never showed it, apart from maybe to the Manchester United lads he was close to. He wasn't treated well by Glenn Hoddle and maybe indirectly it contributed.' </p> <p>After the experience, Sir Alex Ferguson urged Beckham to get back to the people he loved and it is in such an environment that he has since flourished, despite the personal terrace abuse - or, dare one suggest, even perhaps because of it. Stalkers and death threats, both of which Beckham has been subjected to, are quite another matter, however. </p> <p>Le Saux has also had to endure terrace vilification. 'You hear it but it's at a distance. Sometimes it just doesn't bother you if you are focused,' he says. 'Sometimes it eats at you and maybe that explains why David reacted to it early on. In my opinion it's a sad reflection on some people who watch football.</p> <p>'We should be looking at someone like David Beckham and saying: \"It's great that he's playing football in this country for us and our kids to see.\" Yes boo him, but why pick on him? It's disgusting. I just think people deserve some sort of respect, especially people who are very good at their job.' This time Kevin Keegan appears to have talked him up and made him feel secure pre-tournament by starting him in all three warm-up games. 'There's never been a player who can cross the ball like him,' says the England manager. 'He's one of a kind, an exceptional talent. He'd be a key player in Brazil's side. No one in the game underestimates his ability.'</p> <p>And it is that ability, his character having come through a searching examination, which is crucial to England's chances. He still harbours a desire to play in the centre of midfield, to become the No10 that seems to bestow true greatness - emulating the man who beat him to World Player of the Year, Rivaldo. </p> <p>But though Beckham performed adequately in the role for Manchester United in the European Cup final against Bayern Munich last year as replacement for the suspended Roy Keane, more recently against Brazil he wandered through 30 minutes looking lost, his concerns about his positioning and defensive role undermining his creative function. </p> <p>It is something Hoddle eventually had in mind for him, during the time before he had second thoughts. 'He sees the furthest pass first,' said the then admiring Hoddle, who no doubt believed the boy embodied something of himself. It is still as the modern wide player, though, that Beckham looks best equipped to serve the national team, utilising the move infield only as variation to disrupt the opposition.</p> <p>At first sight, he does not seem blessed with great pace, or the dribbling skills to go past defenders, though a weaving goal against Real Madrid this season showed the close control developing in his game. More, his trademark has been manipulation of a football that has been developed as a result of the modern plastic, lacquered balls which swerve and dip as encouraged of manufacturers by the game's excitement-seeking governing bodies.</p> <p>Perhaps Beckham's boots - silver being the latest trend for the lad who said that he has always taken a pride in his appearance since choosing an extravagant outfit as a pageboy at a family wedding - also have something to do with it. Unusually, as most players prefer worn old favourites, he changes them every few games for a new hand-stitched pair, retaining the ones he has done well in out of superstition.</p> <p>Le Saux has played against him many times, both for Chelsea and in England training. 'The most important thing is to stop him crossing the ball because his supply is so consistent,' he says - and Andy Cole has described it as 'like Christmas coming every Saturday'. Le Saux adds: 'Manchester United gear themselves up to providing him with the ball in areas where he is dangerous. But it's very difficult to get to him before he has had a touch and set himself for the cross.</p> <p>'As a full-back, I am always trying to edge myself towards him so that I get there as the ball is arriving. If you get there when he has had his first touch, it is too late because he will whip the ball around your ears. Normally I would leave the wide player and cover for the centre backs but United switch the ball very quickly from right to left, quicker than you can get there. </p> <p>'For me, he has a wonderful relationship with his team because they really appreciate what he can do and he is lucky because they make his job easier for him.'</p> <p>It is probably what Beckham appreciates, why he backed down after being dropped against Leeds. And probably what England need to do more, as Keegan has hinted in statements that there is more to come from Beckham.</p> <p>'I could get into more scoring positions but I concentrate on putting the right ball in and the team winning,' Beckham says, aware of his record of only one goal in 31 internationals. </p> <p>That came against Colombia, the only free kick converted directly at France 98. He also points up the difference between himself and Ryan Giggs. 'He attacks players, he can run at them like Maradona and I can't do that. I just aim to whip it into the box. If I can get past someone I will but I don't need to to make an impact.' What England would give for the balance that Giggs provides, in more ways than one.</p> <p>'I think he's also getting more confident about going past people. I've noticed it recently,' adds Le Saux of Beckham. 'But the weakness is that although he's quick, he's not lightning and you don't have to give him a couple of yards in case he checks and runs past you. You can allow yourself to get quite close to him.' On the debit side for this observer last season was also his rolling around after a foul but hardly vicious challenge by Bordeaux's Lilian Laslandes.</p> <p>'He's relentless,' adds Le Saux. 'I'm always trying for the initiative because there is nothing worse for a wide midfield player than having a full-back bombing on and you have to cover. I'm always trying to exploit someone creative so that they can be less effective if they are breathing heavily. But he has that United appetite for work and he is never fazed. You can be having a great game against him but he will come back for more.'</p> <p>What concerned Ferguson during the Leeds affair was that the work ethic might be waning amid all the showbiz stuff 'n' nonsense that was filling the papers. As best friends do, Gary Neville is also said to have reminded him of his primary professional purpose. Under Eric Cantona, Beckham learned the value of afternoon work. It is that which honed the dead-ball skills.</p> <p>I recall seeing him in a warm-up against Chelsea once curling one home via the underside of the crossbar. Twenty minutes into the game he repeated it for real. 'I know when they're going in,' says Beckham. 'I can feel it. I was always able to hit them like that even as a kid, but I used to practise them back then, too. That's why they come off.'</p> <p>As a boy he scored 101 goals in 115 games for his club, Ridgeway Rovers and first came to United's notice when he won a Bobby Charlton Soccer Skills challenge with record points. 'Shoot at all times if you get a chance,' Sir Bobby told him. So skinny was Beckham, though, that he couldn't make the England Schoolboys team. </p> <p>Ferguson knows that a one-eyed Beckham, not sidetracked by abuse or involved in feuds and irrelevant issues on the field, is potentially a footballing vision. 'David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of a God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless [that word again] application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate,' Hugh McIlvanney wrote on Ferguson's behalf for his autobiography.</p> <p>There is, too, an arrogance to Beckham on the pitch. 'The great ones can have that. Cantona did,' Ferguson said once. But it is not evident off the pitch. 'Anyone who says that doesn't really know me,' Beckham has said. Once after giving a press conference, he inquired after the identity of a certain journalist. The man stepped forward to be told by Beckham that, having written a recent piece questioning whether he was getting big for his boots, he should not judge people without knowing them.</p> <p>That press conference was a vicarious, excruciating experience. It was in La Baule in '98, a few days after he had been left out of England's opening game against Tunisia. One thing it did prove was that his Essex drawl giving the impression of dullness merely covered a brave sincerity at a time when he must have felt bemused at the offhand behaviour of his boyhood hero Hoddle. </p> <p>Ferguson has also admitted that Beckham's stubbornness has caused him to disagree with his player but that he admires his resolve. 'When the chips are down on the football field, you can bet your life that David Beckham won't be found wanting,' he has said. </p> <p>In turn, Beckham undoubtedly trusts and respects his manager, even if he can resent the authoritarianism at times. He has spoken of how he came to see that a loan spell to Preston North End that Ferguson arranged five years ago was a valuable learning and motivational experience. </p> <p>Ferguson has noticed, he added, that Beckham has gone from being a fun-loving boy to a more introverted man in recent years. </p> <p>It may be just a maturing process but if not, it is a shame if all the vilification and the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, jokes, have subdued him. Why is it that we expect people paid to be articulate with their feet to be so with their mouths?</p> <p>Let the TV impressionist Alistair MacGowan say it for him. In a brilliant sketch going beyond taking the mickey to affectionate admiration, MacGowan had him sat at dinner with Posh and two critics not dissimilar to Tom Paulin and Germaine Greer, unable to resist trying to impress him and Posh with their erudition and insight.</p> <p>'The thing I like about art and sport,' said a humble Becks, 'is that they are both about creating, expressing yourself as a human being. If you are not creating, you are just on the sidelines shouting abuse. And at the end of the day, a lot of criticism can be destructive. Look at Gazza. Look at Gary Barlow. I just think we should respect all artists, all creators.'</p>",

This time, though at 25 he is still two or three years from his peak, he has honed the game and has developed the temperament to make amends for 30 June, 1998. Any repeat of the first of only two red cards in his career and the phone-in lines will hum with more personal name-callers. It was certainly a key period in the life and career of David Beckham, as he himself has recognised going into the subsequent major championship. 'I know I have a short fuse at times but I don't think what went on against Argentina will happen again,' he insists. 'It has made me stronger mentally.' 'In hindsight, it was an accident waiting to happen,' recalls his team-mate Graeme Le Saux of the episode. 'The whole World Cup and before at La Manga, you could see the frustration in him building up. 'He was away from his girlfriend and coupled with things that were said and which happened it was very difficult for him, although he never showed it, apart from maybe to the Manchester United lads he was close to. He wasn't treated well by Glenn Hoddle and maybe indirectly it contributed.' After the experience, Sir Alex Ferguson urged Beckham to get back to the people he loved and it is in such an environment that he has since flourished, despite the personal terrace abuse - or, dare one suggest, even perhaps because of it. Stalkers and death threats, both of which Beckham has been subjected to, are quite another matter, however. Le Saux has also had to endure terrace vilification. 'You hear it but it's at a distance. Sometimes it just doesn't bother you if you are focused,' he says. 'Sometimes it eats at you and maybe that explains why David reacted to it early on. In my opinion it's a sad reflection on some people who watch football. 'We should be looking at someone like David Beckham and saying: \"It's great that he's playing football in this country for us and our kids to see.\" Yes boo him, but why pick on him? It's disgusting. I just think people deserve some sort of respect, especially people who are very good at their job.' This time Kevin Keegan appears to have talked him up and made him feel secure pre-tournament by starting him in all three warm-up games. 'There's never been a player who can cross the ball like him,' says the England manager. 'He's one of a kind, an exceptional talent. He'd be a key player in Brazil's side. No one in the game underestimates his ability.' And it is that ability, his character having come through a searching examination, which is crucial to England's chances. He still harbours a desire to play in the centre of midfield, to become the No10 that seems to bestow true greatness - emulating the man who beat him to World Player of the Year, Rivaldo. But though Beckham performed adequately in the role for Manchester United in the European Cup final against Bayern Munich last year as replacement for the suspended Roy Keane, more recently against Brazil he wandered through 30 minutes looking lost, his concerns about his positioning and defensive role undermining his creative function. It is something Hoddle eventually had in mind for him, during the time before he had second thoughts. 'He sees the furthest pass first,' said the then admiring Hoddle, who no doubt believed the boy embodied something of himself. It is still as the modern wide player, though, that Beckham looks best equipped to serve the national team, utilising the move infield only as variation to disrupt the opposition. At first sight, he does not seem blessed with great pace, or the dribbling skills to go past defenders, though a weaving goal against Real Madrid this season showed the close control developing in his game. More, his trademark has been manipulation of a football that has been developed as a result of the modern plastic, lacquered balls which swerve and dip as encouraged of manufacturers by the game's excitement-seeking governing bodies. Perhaps Beckham's boots - silver being the latest trend for the lad who said that he has always taken a pride in his appearance since choosing an extravagant outfit as a pageboy at a family wedding - also have something to do with it. Unusually, as most players prefer worn old favourites, he changes them every few games for a new hand-stitched pair, retaining the ones he has done well in out of superstition. Le Saux has played against him many times, both for Chelsea and in England training. 'The most important thing is to stop him crossing the ball because his supply is so consistent,' he says - and Andy Cole has described it as 'like Christmas coming every Saturday'. Le Saux adds: 'Manchester United gear themselves up to providing him with the ball in areas where he is dangerous. But it's very difficult to get to him before he has had a touch and set himself for the cross. 'As a full-back, I am always trying to edge myself towards him so that I get there as the ball is arriving. If you get there when he has had his first touch, it is too late because he will whip the ball around your ears. Normally I would leave the wide player and cover for the centre backs but United switch the ball very quickly from right to left, quicker than you can get there. 'For me, he has a wonderful relationship with his team because they really appreciate what he can do and he is lucky because they make his job easier for him.' It is probably what Beckham appreciates, why he backed down after being dropped against Leeds. And probably what England need to do more, as Keegan has hinted in statements that there is more to come from Beckham. 'I could get into more scoring positions but I concentrate on putting the right ball in and the team winning,' Beckham says, aware of his record of only one goal in 31 internationals. That came against Colombia, the only free kick converted directly at France 98. He also points up the difference between himself and Ryan Giggs. 'He attacks players, he can run at them like Maradona and I can't do that. I just aim to whip it into the box. If I can get past someone I will but I don't need to to make an impact.' What England would give for the balance that Giggs provides, in more ways than one. 'I think he's also getting more confident about going past people. I've noticed it recently,' adds Le Saux of Beckham. 'But the weakness is that although he's quick, he's not lightning and you don't have to give him a couple of yards in case he checks and runs past you. You can allow yourself to get quite close to him.' On the debit side for this observer last season was also his rolling around after a foul but hardly vicious challenge by Bordeaux's Lilian Laslandes. 'He's relentless,' adds Le Saux. 'I'm always trying for the initiative because there is nothing worse for a wide midfield player than having a full-back bombing on and you have to cover. I'm always trying to exploit someone creative so that they can be less effective if they are breathing heavily. But he has that United appetite for work and he is never fazed. You can be having a great game against him but he will come back for more.' What concerned Ferguson during the Leeds affair was that the work ethic might be waning amid all the showbiz stuff 'n' nonsense that was filling the papers. As best friends do, Gary Neville is also said to have reminded him of his primary professional purpose. Under Eric Cantona, Beckham learned the value of afternoon work. It is that which honed the dead-ball skills. I recall seeing him in a warm-up against Chelsea once curling one home via the underside of the crossbar. Twenty minutes into the game he repeated it for real. 'I know when they're going in,' says Beckham. 'I can feel it. I was always able to hit them like that even as a kid, but I used to practise them back then, too. That's why they come off.' As a boy he scored 101 goals in 115 games for his club, Ridgeway Rovers and first came to United's notice when he won a Bobby Charlton Soccer Skills challenge with record points. 'Shoot at all times if you get a chance,' Sir Bobby told him. So skinny was Beckham, though, that he couldn't make the England Schoolboys team. Ferguson knows that a one-eyed Beckham, not sidetracked by abuse or involved in feuds and irrelevant issues on the field, is potentially a footballing vision. 'David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of a God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless [that word again] application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate,' Hugh McIlvanney wrote on Ferguson's behalf for his autobiography. There is, too, an arrogance to Beckham on the pitch. 'The great ones can have that. Cantona did,' Ferguson said once. But it is not evident off the pitch. 'Anyone who says that doesn't really know me,' Beckham has said. Once after giving a press conference, he inquired after the identity of a certain journalist. The man stepped forward to be told by Beckham that, having written a recent piece questioning whether he was getting big for his boots, he should not judge people without knowing them. That press conference was a vicarious, excruciating experience. It was in La Baule in '98, a few days after he had been left out of England's opening game against Tunisia. One thing it did prove was that his Essex drawl giving the impression of dullness merely covered a brave sincerity at a time when he must have felt bemused at the offhand behaviour of his boyhood hero Hoddle. Ferguson has also admitted that Beckham's stubbornness has caused him to disagree with his player but that he admires his resolve. 'When the chips are down on the football field, you can bet your life that David Beckham won't be found wanting,' he has said. In turn, Beckham undoubtedly trusts and respects his manager, even if he can resent the authoritarianism at times. He has spoken of how he came to see that a loan spell to Preston North End that Ferguson arranged five years ago was a valuable learning and motivational experience. Ferguson has noticed, he added, that Beckham has gone from being a fun-loving boy to a more introverted man in recent years. It may be just a maturing process but if not, it is a shame if all the vilification and the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, jokes, have subdued him. Why is it that we expect people paid to be articulate with their feet to be so with their mouths? Let the TV impressionist Alistair MacGowan say it for him. In a brilliant sketch going beyond taking the mickey to affectionate admiration, MacGowan had him sat at dinner with Posh and two critics not dissimilar to Tom Paulin and Germaine Greer, unable to resist trying to impress him and Posh with their erudition and insight. 'The thing I like about art and sport,' said a humble Becks, 'is that they are both about creating, expressing yourself as a human being. If you are not creating, you are just on the sidelines shouting abuse. And at the end of the day, a lot of criticism can be destructive. Look at Gazza. Look at Gary Barlow. I just think we should respect all artists, all creators.'",

      "body": "<p>When I moved to the Netherlands in October 1976, I was seven years old and had never previously heard of the country. Only later did I realise I had arrived in the middle of a Golden Age.</p> <p>My father had taken a job in the town of Leiden, and our new house stood in what I now know to be a typical Dutch street. The tiny terraced houses were fronted by huge windows, through which passers-by could peer in to make sure nothing untoward was happening.</p> <p>On our first Dutch evening, my brother and I ventured on to the street to meet the other children. They greeted us by singing what were probably the only English words they knew: 'Crazy boys, crazy boys!' But over the next few evenings relations improved. Soon we became regulars in the street's daily football match.</p> <p>I had barely kicked a football before. In London, nobody I knew had. But in Leiden everybody did. The Netherlands was then the best footballing country on earth. In 1974 the Dutch team had reached the final of the World Cup playing a brand of football that tens of millions of people today still remember. 'Total football' the English called it, while the Hispanic countries named the team 'la naranja mec\u00e1nica', or The Clockwork Orange. From Jacques Tati to Rudolf Nureyev, the world watched entranced.</p> <p>At the next World Cup, in 1978, Holland reached the final again. Playing against Argentina in Buenos Aires, in a stadium packed with armed soldiers and the generals who then ruled the country, the Dutch went 1-0 down. Then, a lanky flower seller from the north of Holland named Dick Nanninga headed the ball into the confetti-strewn Argentina net. I can still hear the cheer erupting from our neighbouring houses. In the end Argentina won 3-1.</p> <p>I left the Netherlands in 1986, and I now feel Dutch in one regard only. At Euro 2000 I will be rooting for Oranje (as we call them in Holland). So will millions of other people from Jakarta to Timbuktoo who barely know that the Netherlands is a country as well as a football team. The reason is not merely that the Dutch have an excellent team, although they do: they are the bookmakers' favourites to win this championship.</p> <p>The important thing is that the Dutch play the beautiful game. In February, after they had humiliated Germany in a friendly, Oliver Kahn, the German goalkeeper, said: 'We have played against the finest that there is in European football. It's madness when you see these perfect footballers.' In the Seventeenth century the Dutch produced great and distinctive painters. Now this overcrowded country of just 16 million people manufactures footballers. Why? At the risk of giving away the secret, I will explain. </p> <p>Soon after my arrival I discovered that every boy in Holland belonged to a football club. In Leiden, which then had just over 100,000 inhabitants, there were dozens. Some of them fielded twenty senior teams, seven teams of under-eights, and so on. Not to play football was not to exist.</p> <p>My brother and I joined the Ajax Sportman Combinatie, a club founded in 1892, which had once been one of the best in Holland and still possessed a genuine stand. ASC was no longer any good, but that never deflected me.</p> <p>As a child I would rise each Saturday at 7am and race to the ground. The gates would still be locked, but my team-mates and I would rattle them until, at last, at about 8am, someone unlocked them. Then we would play on ASC's gravel pitch until our match kicked off. Afterwards we would hang around the ground hoping for a game with another team. Then we would go to someone's house to play football.</p> <p>When the football was rained off we would race to the ground anyway, where we would be taken to a hall to play indoors, or be shown videos of the 1974 and 1978 World Cups.</p> <p>Almost all Dutch boys spent their youth much as I did. Of the 14 million people living in Holland in the Seventies, one million played football at clubs like ASC. No other country had a higher proportion of registered footballers. Franz Beckenbauer said he finally understood why Dutch players were so good when he flew over Holland in a helicopter and saw that it consisted chiefly of football grounds.</p> <p>No wonder we all played. My parents paid ASC about \u00a350 a year, and in return my brother and I were allowed virtually to live at the club. Twice a week we were trained by coaches who had completed long courses for the privilege. One had played professional football. We played on pitches obsessively watered and mowed by the local council. Dutch football, in fact, is a testament to Dutch social democracy.</p> <p>In England, when two lovers of football meet, the first question is: 'Which club do you support?' In the Netherlands, the question is, 'Which club do you play for?' The Dutch are players first, fans second. I once asked Boudewijn Zenden, who plays for Barcelona and Holland, which club he had supported as a child. None, he said. Nor did he have posters of idols on his walls. Zenden played.</p> <p>When I returned to England, I met people who professed to love football, watched their team each weekend, but never kicked a ball. I discovered that in England it is hard to get the chance. It is no myth that Margaret Thatcher sold off the school playing-fields. She did. Between 1981 and 1997, an estimated 5,000 playing fields were sold in Britain and turned into houses and supermarkets. There are other problems besides. The Liverpool and District Sunday League has lost more than half its teams in recent years, as councils raise the pitch rent and players get fed up changing in the bushes to play in the mud.</p> <p>I now live in central London. Within a few miles there are a couple of million people, but they are served by fewer football pitches than are the people of Leiden. No wonder England is not very good at football.</p> <p>Albert Camus, the late goalkeeper and sometime novelist, said: 'All that I know most surely about morality and the obligations of man, I owe to football.' Well, all that I know most surely about Holland, I owe to football. Playing the game was an education in the country. </p> <p>We encountered teams from seaside villages where the people were so devoutly Protestant they only played on Saturdays. They lived on brown bread, fish and dairy products, so that even in the under-elevens many of them stood six feet tall. Edwin van der Sar, the giant who is today Holland's goalkeeper, comes from one of those clubs.</p> <p>In villages further inland, where the local farmers had become millionaires selling flower bulbs to the world, the local teams would draw crowds of several thousand. The best players received such lavish payments under the table from the farmers that many of them refused to turn professional, saying they could not afford to. Each club we played against had a distinctive culture: Protestant or posh, bulb-farming or Dutch West Indian. </p> <p>The Netherlands, I discovered, is a country of clubs. The Dutch have the time for it. Particularly in the 1970s, vast numbers of people did not work. They had once gone to a doctor complaining of stress or tiredness or minor backache, and had been told to retire and draw 70 per cent of their last salary ad infinitum. Those who still worked did so gently. Even today, virtually every office in Holland is deserted by 5pm. My father usually returned home at lunchtime and spent the afternoon skulking indoors in case a colleague saw him.</p> <p>When he went outside, my father used his leisure time to play cricket. Most people used it for football. But playing was only one way of passing time at the club. Many Dutchmen think that their real job is chairing their football club, or its materials committee, or coaching the fourteenth team. Club culture in Holland was universal. Ajax Sportman Combinatie was one of the worst clubs in the country, yet it was recognisably related to the best, which also happened to be called Ajax.</p> <p>When Ajax of Amsterdam was founded, in 1900, its board wrote to my club asking permission to use the name Ajax. We granted it, but said we would review the matter a hundred years later. Ajax agreed. Sadly, by the time 2000 rolled around it turned out that ASC had mislaid Ajax's letter. The Amsterdammers have thus retained their name.</p> <p>In the 1970s Ajax of Amsterdam was still a neighbourhood club rather like ASC. It just happened to be the best neighbourhood club in the world.</p> <p>Ajax won three consecutive European Cups between 1971 and 1973, with a team consisting mainly of local boys who would provide the nucleus of the 'naranja mec\u00e1nica'. Barry Hulshoff, the bearded socialist, then the Ajax centre-back, ran into an old man in a Greek mountain village many years later. 'He took my hands and held them and he cried,' Hulshoff recalls. 'It went on for four or five minutes. I was very embarrassed. I just didn't know what was going on.</p> <p> Later my translator explained it. He said there was no television in the village, so this old man used to walk for two hours to reach another village to watch Ajax games on television. The man had loved Ajax and now, in front of him, he saw one of the players he used to watch.'</p> <p>The players whom the Greek had watched came predominantly from Amsterdam-East. Sjaak Swart, the Ajax outside-right, and Piet Keizer, the outside-left, grew up around the corner from each other a short walk from the old Ajax ground. Johan Cruyff, the centre-forward, as a child used to wander up the road to watch the Ajax first team train.</p> <p>Last December I met Swart in his restaurant above an ice rink, just behind where the old Ajax stadium had stood. 'The other day,' said Swart, 'I walked into the canteen at the new Ajax ground and Johan and Pietje were sitting there. ''There they are again, the great forward-line!'' I shout.</p> <p>Then they all had a cup of coffee. I can imagine a similar scene at ASC.</p> <p>So rooted are almost all Dutchmen in club culture that when a star retires, he often instantly finds himself another, lesser club. Swart played nearly 20 years of amateur football after retiring from Ajax. Wim Meutstege, an Ajax player in the late 1970s, later joined ASC. Frank Rijkaard, another Ajax man and the current Oranje manager, plays for the third veterans' eleven of his local club, Abcoude.</p> <p>Rijkaard, still only 37, said: 'We have a nice team, a team of friends, and for an hour and a half we chase, run, play football. Well, fantastic! And then you've sweated, you've done something, and you go into the canteen and drink a beer and chat about the game. Often you have a nice opponent, have a joke along the way. I have no aspirations to anything more.'</p> <p>This winter I watched Rijkaard's contemporary, Ruud Gullit, play for the fifth team of an Amsterdam club, AFC. The opponents were the third eleven of a club called OSDO, and there were about 20 spectators.</p> <p>'By half time Gullit's side were 5-0 down, though they eventually recovered to lose just 5-3. Yet Gullit looked happy. Once or twice he almost scored, but on each occasion he missed the ball entirely. After the game he shook everyone's hand and congratulated the pygmy woman referee. As he walked off the pitch, he exclaimed to no one in particular: 'The second half was better!' We have all left the field on a Saturday afternoon thinking exactly that.</p> <p>The mere fact that almost everyone in Holland plays football cannot itself explain the country's success. Until the 1970s Dutch football was mediocre. Holland would occasionally lose to Luxembourg, and considered their main rivals to be Belgium.</p> <p>It was Johan Cruyff who made the Dutch good at football, but it took me a while to realise this. In October 1976, when I first began to ponder these questions, Cruyff was starting to disappear from the scene. He still played for Barcelona, but had already said he would skip the World Cup in Argentina. He retired from football in 1978. Then, discovering that he had lost all his money in a pig-farming venture, he began playing again in the US.</p> <p>So I got an inkling of who he was only on December 6, 1981, when he returned to Ajax. This little man, whose body had been wrecked by two decades of chain-smoking and being kicked, astounded me most Sundays for the next three years. I remember a penalty-kick he took on December 5, 1982 against Helmond Sport. Instead of shooting in the conventional manner, he passed the ball forward and to his left. There his team-mate Jesper Olsen, running into the penalty area, collected it, and passed it back to Cruyff, who placed the ball in an empty net while the Helmond keeper watched open-mouthed and motionless.</p> <p>Cruyff shaped all Dutch footballers: Gullit and Rijkaard who played with him, the Dutchmen who will appear at Euro 2000, and all of us at ASC. The main change he unwittingly effected in Leiden was to get us talking about football. </p> <p>Cruyff was the man who turned Dutch football into a sort of academic debating society. 'Football is a game you play with your head,' he once said.</p> <p>Other countries do not see it that way. I once asked Gullit to compare the English, the Italians and the Dutch. 'In a Dutch changing room,' he said, 'everyone thinks he knows best. In an Italian changing room everybody probably also thinks he knows best, but nobody dares to tell the manager. And in an English changing room, they just have a laugh.'</p> <p>I have interviewed British chief executives, Argentine generals and Ukrainian mafiosi, but the most talkative people I know are Dutch footballers. You speak to them for an hour and a half, ask every question you can think of, and when you finally turn off the tape recorder they hold forth for another half hour. Sjaak Swart had told me at the start of the interview that he had no time, but when I finally managed to cut him short he said: 'Another cup of coffee, boy?'</p> <p>I will be rooting for the Dutch this month. And I know they are the most gifted team in the championship. But I expect them to lose. That is because the Dutch think winning is beside the point.</p> <p>I realised this ten years ago when I took my football team on a tour of Holland. We won our first match 8-0, and afterwards, over a beer in the canteen, one of our Dutch opponents said to me: 'But of course we played the better football.'</p> <p>He meant that his team had combined better, thought harder, played the prettier game, whereas we had merely been brutish. He was talking nonsense, but he was making a common Dutch point: that playing 'good football' matters more than winning.</p> <p>To the Dutch, 'good football' is the passing, thinking, balletic game invented by Cruyff. The master himself has taken to saying that Holland 'really' won the World Cup of 1974, even though they lost in the final. How so? Well, according to Cruyff, everyone still remembers the beautiful football Holland played, and that is a victory more enduring than mucky gauges like final scores.</p> <p>Guus Hiddink, coach of the Dutch side that reached the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup playing beautiful football, said later: 'You have to say that our style, our philosophy has impressed the world and that's what I'm proud of.' He added: 'I don't know if I'd have been happy with a World Cup won in a bad way. We couldn't have done that.' No coach of any other country could have said that.</p> <p>Rijkaard says he wants to turn Dutch players into winners. This summer, he won't be happy if Holland end up with plaudits but no prize. Or so he says. Win or lose, come autumn he will be chasing after the ball at Abcoude again.</p> <p>Adapted from an article that appeared on 3 June in 'the business', the FT weekend magazine.</p>",

Twice a week we were trained by coaches who had completed long courses for the privilege. One had played professional football. We played on pitches obsessively watered and mowed by the local council. Dutch football, in fact, is a testament to Dutch social democracy. In England, when two lovers of football meet, the first question is: 'Which club do you support?' In the Netherlands, the question is, 'Which club do you play for?' The Dutch are players first, fans second. I once asked Boudewijn Zenden, who plays for Barcelona and Holland, which club he had supported as a child. None, he said. Nor did he have posters of idols on his walls. Zenden played. When I returned to England, I met people who professed to love football, watched their team each weekend, but never kicked a ball. I discovered that in England it is hard to get the chance. It is no myth that Margaret Thatcher sold off the school playing-fields. She did. Between 1981 and 1997, an estimated 5,000 playing fields were sold in Britain and turned into houses and supermarkets. There are other problems besides. The Liverpool and District Sunday League has lost more than half its teams in recent years, as councils raise the pitch rent and players get fed up changing in the bushes to play in the mud. I now live in central London. Within a few miles there are a couple of million people, but they are served by fewer football pitches than are the people of Leiden. No wonder England is not very good at football. Albert Camus, the late goalkeeper and sometime novelist, said: 'All that I know most surely about morality and the obligations of man, I owe to football.' Well, all that I know most surely about Holland, I owe to football. Playing the game was an education in the country. We encountered teams from seaside villages where the people were so devoutly Protestant they only played on Saturdays. They lived on brown bread, fish and dairy products, so that even in the under-elevens many of them stood six feet tall. Edwin van der Sar, the giant who is today Holland's goalkeeper, comes from one of those clubs. In villages further inland, where the local farmers had become millionaires selling flower bulbs to the world, the local teams would draw crowds of several thousand. The best players received such lavish payments under the table from the farmers that many of them refused to turn professional, saying they could not afford to. Each club we played against had a distinctive culture: Protestant or posh, bulb-farming or Dutch West Indian. The Netherlands, I discovered, is a country of clubs. The Dutch have the time for it. Particularly in the 1970s, vast numbers of people did not work. They had once gone to a doctor complaining of stress or tiredness or minor backache, and had been told to retire and draw 70 per cent of their last salary ad infinitum. Those who still worked did so gently. Even today, virtually every office in Holland is deserted by 5pm. My father usually returned home at lunchtime and spent the afternoon skulking indoors in case a colleague saw him. When he went outside, my father used his leisure time to play cricket. Most people used it for football. But playing was only one way of passing time at the club. Many Dutchmen think that their real job is chairing their football club, or its materials committee, or coaching the fourteenth team. Club culture in Holland was universal. Ajax Sportman Combinatie was one of the worst clubs in the country, yet it was recognisably related to the best, which also happened to be called Ajax. When Ajax of Amsterdam was founded, in 1900, its board wrote to my club asking permission to use the name Ajax. We granted it, but said we would review the matter a hundred years later. Ajax agreed. Sadly, by the time 2000 rolled around it turned out that ASC had mislaid Ajax's letter. The Amsterdammers have thus retained their name. In the 1970s Ajax of Amsterdam was still a neighbourhood club rather like ASC. It just happened to be the best neighbourhood club in the world. Ajax won three consecutive European Cups between 1971 and 1973, with a team consisting mainly of local boys who would provide the nucleus of the 'naranja mec\u00e1nica'. Barry Hulshoff, the bearded socialist, then the Ajax centre-back, ran into an old man in a Greek mountain village many years later. 'He took my hands and held them and he cried,' Hulshoff recalls. 'It went on for four or five minutes. I was very embarrassed. I just didn't know what was going on. Later my translator explained it. He said there was no television in the village, so this old man used to walk for two hours to reach another village to watch Ajax games on television. The man had loved Ajax and now, in front of him, he saw one of the players he used to watch.' The players whom the Greek had watched came predominantly from Amsterdam-East. Sjaak Swart, the Ajax outside-right, and Piet Keizer, the outside-left, grew up around the corner from each other a short walk from the old Ajax ground. Johan Cruyff, the centre-forward, as a child used to wander up the road to watch the Ajax first team train. Last December I met Swart in his restaurant above an ice rink, just behind where the old Ajax stadium had stood. 'The other day,' said Swart, 'I walked into the canteen at the new Ajax ground and Johan and Pietje were sitting there. ''There they are again, the great forward-line!'' I shout. Then they all had a cup of coffee. I can imagine a similar scene at ASC. So rooted are almost all Dutchmen in club culture that when a star retires, he often instantly finds himself another, lesser club. Swart played nearly 20 years of amateur football after retiring from Ajax. Wim Meutstege, an Ajax player in the late 1970s, later joined ASC. Frank Rijkaard, another Ajax man and the current Oranje manager, plays for the third veterans' eleven of his local club, Abcoude. Rijkaard, still only 37, said: 'We have a nice team, a team of friends, and for an hour and a half we chase, run, play football. Well, fantastic! And then you've sweated, you've done something, and you go into the canteen and drink a beer and chat about the game. Often you have a nice opponent, have a joke along the way. I have no aspirations to anything more.' This winter I watched Rijkaard's contemporary, Ruud Gullit, play for the fifth team of an Amsterdam club, AFC. The opponents were the third eleven of a club called OSDO, and there were about 20 spectators. 'By half time Gullit's side were 5-0 down, though they eventually recovered to lose just 5-3. Yet Gullit looked happy. Once or twice he almost scored, but on each occasion he missed the ball entirely. After the game he shook everyone's hand and congratulated the pygmy woman referee. As he walked off the pitch, he exclaimed to no one in particular: 'The second half was better!' We have all left the field on a Saturday afternoon thinking exactly that. The mere fact that almost everyone in Holland plays football cannot itself explain the country's success. Until the 1970s Dutch football was mediocre. Holland would occasionally lose to Luxembourg, and considered their main rivals to be Belgium. It was Johan Cruyff who made the Dutch good at football, but it took me a while to realise this. In October 1976, when I first began to ponder these questions, Cruyff was starting to disappear from the scene. He still played for Barcelona, but had already said he would skip the World Cup in Argentina. He retired from football in 1978. Then, discovering that he had lost all his money in a pig-farming venture, he began playing again in the US. So I got an inkling of who he was only on December 6, 1981, when he returned to Ajax. This little man, whose body had been wrecked by two decades of chain-smoking and being kicked, astounded me most Sundays for the next three years. I remember a penalty-kick he took on December 5, 1982 against Helmond Sport. Instead of shooting in the conventional manner, he passed the ball forward and to his left. There his team-mate Jesper Olsen, running into the penalty area, collected it, and passed it back to Cruyff, who placed the ball in an empty net while the Helmond keeper watched open-mouthed and motionless. Cruyff shaped all Dutch footballers: Gullit and Rijkaard who played with him, the Dutchmen who will appear at Euro 2000, and all of us at ASC. The main change he unwittingly effected in Leiden was to get us talking about football. Cruyff was the man who turned Dutch football into a sort of academic debating society. 'Football is a game you play with your head,' he once said. Other countries do not see it that way. I once asked Gullit to compare the English, the Italians and the Dutch. 'In a Dutch changing room,' he said, 'everyone thinks he knows best. In an Italian changing room everybody probably also thinks he knows best, but nobody dares to tell the manager. And in an English changing room, they just have a laugh.' I have interviewed British chief executives, Argentine generals and Ukrainian mafiosi, but the most talkative people I know are Dutch footballers. You speak to them for an hour and a half, ask every question you can think of, and when you finally turn off the tape recorder they hold forth for another half hour. Sjaak Swart had told me at the start of the interview that he had no time, but when I finally managed to cut him short he said: 'Another cup of coffee, boy?' I will be rooting for the Dutch this month. And I know they are the most gifted team in the championship. But I expect them to lose. That is because the Dutch think winning is beside the point. I realised this ten years ago when I took my football team on a tour of Holland. We won our first match 8-0, and afterwards, over a beer in the canteen, one of our Dutch opponents said to me: 'But of course we played the better football.' He meant that his team had combined better, thought harder, played the prettier game, whereas we had merely been brutish. He was talking nonsense, but he was making a common Dutch point: that playing 'good football' matters more than winning. To the Dutch, 'good football' is the passing, thinking, balletic game invented by Cruyff. The master himself has taken to saying that Holland 'really' won the World Cup of 1974, even though they lost in the final. How so? Well, according to Cruyff, everyone still remembers the beautiful football Holland played, and that is a victory more enduring than mucky gauges like final scores. Guus Hiddink, coach of the Dutch side that reached the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup playing beautiful football, said later: 'You have to say that our style, our philosophy has impressed the world and that's what I'm proud of.' He added: 'I don't know if I'd have been happy with a World Cup won in a bad way. We couldn't have done that.' No coach of any other country could have said that. Rijkaard says he wants to turn Dutch players into winners. This summer, he won't be happy if Holland end up with plaudits but no prize. Or so he says. Win or lose, come autumn he will be chasing after the ball at Abcoude again. Adapted from an article that appeared on 3 June in 'the business', the FT weekend magazine.",

'But if I was betting I would go for Holland or France. That's not to say I don't think England have a chance. I think we've got a good chance, and we're a decent price.' </p> <p>Keegan certainly knows how to keep things light. A German journalist at his major press conference of the week asked in surprise whether England briefings were always conducted with so much knockabout and self-deprecating humour. 'I am not used to this sort of thing with the German managers,' she said. 'This is more like the Muppet Show.' </p> <p>No-one ever said that of Glenn Hoddle's press conferences so Keegan must be doing something right, though he is acutely aware that the time has arrived for action to back up the banter. He is sick of hearing he has no tournament experience, fed up with fielding negative questions about Alan Shearer, and anxious for the football to start. He needs a win against Portugal not just to simplify England's route to the second stage, but to buy himself some breathing space.</p> <p>Keegan has never entirely won over his doubters, and popularity will not help him if England make an unconvincing start to this campaign. To put the matter bluntly, a poor result in Eindhoven tomorrow evening could initiate a downward spiral that could see Keegan out of a job within a few weeks. </p> <p>The manager still insists England can win the competition if they play as well as they can, but admitted last week he has never actually seen them play as well as they can during his time in charge. If the hoped-for improvement fails to materialise in the next fortnight, or if Keegan is charged with not knowing how to get the best out of his team, there would seem little point in continuing the same wait-and-see policy into the next World Cup. </p> <p>'Every coach has his own methods, and it's fair to say mine are still under scrutiny,' Keegan said. 'But I do get a bit annoyed with people saying I have no tournament experience as a manager. I know that as well as anyone. No-one gets a grounding in this job. Very few people take on the job knowing what international management is all about. You just fly by the seat of your pants.' </p> <p>Keegan knows one thing though. Tomorrow's game is the big one. Bigger than Germany next week. Because England's performance will dictate what happens in the rest of the tournament. Whether qualification is easy or difficult, whether Keegan has got the team right or whether it needs to be changed, whether the manager gets the nation's backing. </p> <p>'We haven't even looked at Germany yet, I think it would be wrong to do so,' Keegan said. 'Everything is focused on Portugal at the moment. The million dollar question is how you win your first game without leaving yourself open and jeopardising the points. We certainly want to win it, if we come back with three points we will know exactly what we need to do in the other games, but it's equally important we don't lose.' </p> <p>The manager is not disclosing what formation he prefers, but it sounds like a risk-free 4-4-2, especially as he claims to have settled on the side for the Portugal game a fortnight ago. That would suggest Denis Wise on the left, rather than Nick Barmby or Steve McManaman, in a line-up similar to the one that started against Brazil except for Tony Adams coming in for Martin Keown. </p> <p>It is possible Keegan is coming round to the view that three central defenders and wing-backs best utilise England's resources - he played that system at Newcastle after all - but he is unlikely to try anything too surprising in the first game. 'It's very important not to get beat in the first match,' said Shearer, doubtless echoing his manager's view. 'I'm not saying we will be going out for a draw, but a draw wouldn't be a bad result,' the captain added. </p> <p>'You've got to look at who you are playing,' Keegan said. 'Portugal play with two wide players and just one up front. What I want is first to pass the ball at our pace rather than the opposition's, which is something we didn't manage in Malta last week, and secondly to be playing most of the game in their half. With the players we've got we need that to happen.' </p> <p>Keegan is also looking to keep the players he has got on the pitch until the end. England's rash of dismissals in qualifying for Euro 2000 has become a fading memory, but competition always brings a competitive edge. 'I want players who have got character and guts, players who are winners, and if you want players like that it is unreasonable to expect them not to pick up bookings from time to time,' he said.</p> <p>'But I do want to keep 11 men on the pitch, that's the last thing I say to the lads before they go out. Losing a man always makes life difficult. You can compensate to a degree, but it ain't half hard work. It is vitally important we don't put ourselves at such a disadvantage.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Franz Beckenbauer is Germany's supreme optimist. He strongly fancies Erich Ribbeck's team to beat all comers at Euro 2000. Beckenbauer believes Germany can successfully defend the European title they won four years ago at Wembley. 'Not because we've dramatically improved in the last few days. But because there are not really any who're better than us.' The Kaiser has spoken. But there has been no round of applause or nods of support. There are few, if any, in the land of the champions who share his optimism. In fact an almost embarrassing silence has followed the Kaisers' remarks. Even those as well qualified as Beckenbauer have been much more careful about Euro 2000. Notably Gunter Netzer who played as elegantly for M\u00f6nchengladbach and with as much sophistication as Beckenbauer for Bayern Munich in Germany's good old days. He hopes but does not believe Germany can win it again. 'We've got a problem that no one ever reckoned with. We're short of first-class defensive players.

Nielsen, <br> Goldbaek, Molnar, Beck, Gravesen. <br></p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> G Benko (Austria)<br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> The Danes get us away against the World Champions. Gronkjaer forces a corner early on. The Danish feel another was warranted following the cross, but the Austrian ref gives a goal kick.<br> <strong>2</strong> A familiar sight for Newcastle fans - John Dahl Tomasson, through with just Barthez to beat, barely makes the keeper work with a poor shot. A golden opportunity.<br> <strong>4</strong> Anelka breaks at pace but loses possession on the edge of the area.<br> <strong>5</strong> Could be a fun year ahead at Old Trafford. Barthez comes racing out, misses the ball completely but takes out Lauren Blanc instead. Denmark cannot make use of the lose ball with no-one in between the posts. <br> <strong>6</strong> An immense throw from Schmeichel sets the Danes breaking in numbers with the French badly organised. They fail to capitalise, though, Blanc making a late saving interception with Tomasson loitering.<br> <strong>9</strong> Djorkaeff's 30-plus yard shot following a freekick clips the wall but goal kick given.<br> <strong>12</strong> Ebbe Sand brings a good save from Barthez down to his right after the French defence backed off too much.<br> <strong>13</strong> Anelka benefits from iffy linesman's decision, rounds Schmeichel brilliantly, but the angle and number of Danes back put him off and he puts it into the side-netting.<br> <strong>15</strong> Manchester United keepers past and present indulge in a bit of a kicking competition, won by the Dane by about 15 yards.<br> <strong>16 GOAL! France 1 - 0 Denmark</strong> Schmeichel blocks Anelka's darting run, but the ball falls to a curiously placed Lauren Blanc (is that total football, then?) who couldn't miss. Schmeichel has a moan. Reassuring, in a way, to see some things don't change.<br> <strong>18</strong> France playing some lovely stuff. This time the flag does come to Denmark's aid as Anelka (again) shapes up to do some more damage.<br> <strong>20</strong> Gronkjaer looks willing down the Danish left. Takes on Thuram and wins a corner which goes behind without troubling the French at all.<br> <strong>24</strong> Schjonberg thwarts Anelka at the near post. The corner is cleared by Schmeichel's fists.<br> <strong>29</strong> A Danish corner comes to nothing, Barthez leaping for the ball extravagently.<br> <strong>31</strong> The Danes try to find a way through the French back line but apparently lack the guile on this occasion at least.<br> <strong>32</strong> Zidane pings one past Schmeichel's left post from about 25 yards. The French are making chances with measurably greater ease than their opponents.<br> <strong>34</strong> Ooof! Heintze gets in Thuram's way as the Frenchman brings the ball out. It takes the Dane a good few seconds to recover from that.<br> <strong>37</strong> Neilsen's 20 yarder doesn't really test Barthez.<br> <strong>39</strong> Anelka robs the Danes who are lazy in taking a throw just inside the French half. He sets Henry off up the left. Despite the attention of two Danish defenders, the Arsenal man still manages to make his way to within sight of the goal and squeeze in a shot which only just goes wide.<br> <strong>44</strong> Thuram steals possession as the Danes dally once again. He puts it right in front of Nicolas Anelka and only Schjonberg's presence of mind stops a clear run on goal. The resulting corner is cleared.<br> <strong>46</strong> Desailly tries to jockey it out down by his left corner, but is too complacent. The throw-in sets up a few moments of Danish pressure which eventually lead to a corner, but the French deal with it easily.<br> <strong>47</strong> Half time: France 1 - 0 Denmark<br></p> <p><strong>46</strong> France kick off for the second half with neither team having made any changes.<br> <strong>47</strong> Some fantastic play by Zidane up the left, working it out to Henry who just fails to keep control. Denmark clear.<br> <strong>48</strong> Henry gets back to tackle a dithering Bisgaard. It seems the whole French team is willing to get their hands dirty.<br> <strong>50</strong> Henriksen's cross following a half-cleared Danish corner keeps the pressure on the French goal but the second centre is no better than the first.<br> <strong>52</strong> Dodgy, over-the-top challenge by Petit is not especially malicious but it gets him a ticking off. From the freekick Schjonberg hits one low which Barthez doesn't collect properly, but Tomasson characteristically faffs up the rebound when at least half a chance was on offer. Still, the Danes are in the hunt.<br> <strong>55</strong> More like it from Denmark. They stamp out an attempted French counter-attack and turn it into a shooting chance. Bisgaard's effort is poor and gets a deflection anyway, but it is that kind of work rate which has thus far given France the advantage.<br> <strong>58</strong> Blanc hits an incredible ball 50 yards to Henry's feet but the striker's attempt to clip it round Schmeichel is negligible.<br> <strong>59</strong> Substitution for France, Patrick Viera replacing Youri Djorkaeff.<br> <strong>60</strong> Gronkjaer, now playing up the right, gently whips in a cross but Sand's header is weak.<br> <strong>63</strong> Henry's cross from the left wing inch perfect except for the fact its recipient, Anelka, hardly ever scores with his head. And he doesn't this time, either.<br> <strong>64 GOAL! France 2 - 0 Denmark</strong> Wooah! Henry shifts up the field like, well, something off a shiny shovel and is in the area before anyone in a white shirt can get even close. His pace makes it nigh on impossible for Schmeichel to close down the angles as is his want and the Arsenal man simply rolls it into the bottom right hand corner. Breath-taking.<br><strong>67</strong>Anelka threatens to give us an action replay from the right, but he is blocked a little heavily (though legally, says the ref) and Denmark tidy up.<br> <strong>70</strong> By cruel contrast, the Danes have lost what momentum they were building up at the start of the second half. A lumped ball over the top by Colding is pretty uninspiring stuff.<br><strong>72</strong> Double substitution for Denmark, roping off Bisgaard and Tofting and bringing on Martin Jorgensen and Thomas Gravesen.<br><strong>76</strong> Henry is off again and only a challenge by Colding on the goal line stops him from pulling it across for one of three waiting blue shirts. Henry looks awesome.<br> <strong>78</strong> The fresh legged Jorgensen has a dip but his shot is woeful, nearly going out for a throw-in.<br><strong>80</strong> Substitution by Denmark, replacing the ineffective Tomasson with Mikkel Beck.<br> <strong>81</strong> Henry squares a ball into Anelka's stride across the edge of the area but his shot is underhit into Schmeichel's gloves.<br><strong>82</strong> French substitution, Anelka coming off for Sylvian Wiltord.<br><strong>83</strong> A Danish freekick ends up at the feet of the scary-looking Schjonberg. His drive across the six-yard box is blocked somewhat masochistically by Lizerazu.<br><strong>85</strong> Brilliant play in midfield by France. First Wiltord plays a one-two with Deschamps to carry it out, then, having lost the ball, Petit wins it back before Neilsen could control it.<br><strong>87</strong> Schmeichel does just enough to stop Wiltord from clipping it past him after breaking through the middle. Zidanesticks the rebound on the Moon.<br><strong>88</strong> A little too much show-boating from Deschamps lets Jorgenesen have a go from 30 yards, but his shot is fielded well by Barthez.<br><strong>91</strong> Zidane wellies one hard and low right at Schmeichel and it is all he can do to parry it back out.<br><strong>92 GOAL! France 3 - 0 Denmark</strong> Zidane slips it through to Viera who, confronted by Schmeichel, squares it to Wiltord who pushes it in easily. The scorer was certainly in an off-side position when the original ball was played through to Viera, but that would just be nit picking.<br><strong>93</strong> The ref puts Denmark out of their misery - full time: France 3 - 0 Denmark.<br></p>",

Nielsen, Gronkjaer, Tomasson, Sand, Colding, Tofting, Bisgaard. Subs: Sorensen, Kjaer, Hogh, Helveg, Jorgensen, Laursen, B. Nielsen, Goldbaek, Molnar, Beck, Gravesen. Referee: G Benko (Austria) 1 min The Danes get us away against the World Champions. Gronkjaer forces a corner early on. The Danish feel another was warranted following the cross, but the Austrian ref gives a goal kick. 2 A familiar sight for Newcastle fans - John Dahl Tomasson, through with just Barthez to beat, barely makes the keeper work with a poor shot. A golden opportunity. 4 Anelka breaks at pace but loses possession on the edge of the area. 5 Could be a fun year ahead at Old Trafford. Barthez comes racing out, misses the ball completely but takes out Lauren Blanc instead. Denmark cannot make use of the lose ball with no-one in between the posts. 6 An immense throw from Schmeichel sets the Danes breaking in numbers with the French badly organised. They fail to capitalise, though, Blanc making a late saving interception with Tomasson loitering. 9 Djorkaeff's 30-plus yard shot following a freekick clips the wall but goal kick given. 12 Ebbe Sand brings a good save from Barthez down to his right after the French defence backed off too much. 13 Anelka benefits from iffy linesman's decision, rounds Schmeichel brilliantly, but the angle and number of Danes back put him off and he puts it into the side-netting. 15 Manchester United keepers past and present indulge in a bit of a kicking competition, won by the Dane by about 15 yards. 16 GOAL! France 1 - 0 Denmark Schmeichel blocks Anelka's darting run, but the ball falls to a curiously placed Lauren Blanc (is that total football, then?) who couldn't miss. Schmeichel has a moan. Reassuring, in a way, to see some things don't change. 18 France playing some lovely stuff. This time the flag does come to Denmark's aid as Anelka (again) shapes up to do some more damage. 20 Gronkjaer looks willing down the Danish left. Takes on Thuram and wins a corner which goes behind without troubling the French at all. 24 Schjonberg thwarts Anelka at the near post. The corner is cleared by Schmeichel's fists. 29 A Danish corner comes to nothing, Barthez leaping for the ball extravagently. 31 The Danes try to find a way through the French back line but apparently lack the guile on this occasion at least. 32 Zidane pings one past Schmeichel's left post from about 25 yards. The French are making chances with measurably greater ease than their opponents. 34 Ooof! Heintze gets in Thuram's way as the Frenchman brings the ball out. It takes the Dane a good few seconds to recover from that. 37 Neilsen's 20 yarder doesn't really test Barthez. 39 Anelka robs the Danes who are lazy in taking a throw just inside the French half. He sets Henry off up the left. Despite the attention of two Danish defenders, the Arsenal man still manages to make his way to within sight of the goal and squeeze in a shot which only just goes wide. 44 Thuram steals possession as the Danes dally once again. He puts it right in front of Nicolas Anelka and only Schjonberg's presence of mind stops a clear run on goal. The resulting corner is cleared. 46 Desailly tries to jockey it out down by his left corner, but is too complacent. The throw-in sets up a few moments of Danish pressure which eventually lead to a corner, but the French deal with it easily. 47 Half time: France 1 - 0 Denmark 46 France kick off for the second half with neither team having made any changes. 47 Some fantastic play by Zidane up the left, working it out to Henry who just fails to keep control. Denmark clear. 48 Henry gets back to tackle a dithering Bisgaard. It seems the whole French team is willing to get their hands dirty. 50 Henriksen's cross following a half-cleared Danish corner keeps the pressure on the French goal but the second centre is no better than the first. 52 Dodgy, over-the-top challenge by Petit is not especially malicious but it gets him a ticking off. From the freekick Schjonberg hits one low which Barthez doesn't collect properly, but Tomasson characteristically faffs up the rebound when at least half a chance was on offer. Still, the Danes are in the hunt. 55 More like it from Denmark. They stamp out an attempted French counter-attack and turn it into a shooting chance. Bisgaard's effort is poor and gets a deflection anyway, but it is that kind of work rate which has thus far given France the advantage. 58 Blanc hits an incredible ball 50 yards to Henry's feet but the striker's attempt to clip it round Schmeichel is negligible. 59 Substitution for France, Patrick Viera replacing Youri Djorkaeff. 60 Gronkjaer, now playing up the right, gently whips in a cross but Sand's header is weak. 63 Henry's cross from the left wing inch perfect except for the fact its recipient, Anelka, hardly ever scores with his head. And he doesn't this time, either. 64 GOAL! France 2 - 0 Denmark Wooah! Henry shifts up the field like, well, something off a shiny shovel and is in the area before anyone in a white shirt can get even close. His pace makes it nigh on impossible for Schmeichel to close down the angles as is his want and the Arsenal man simply rolls it into the bottom right hand corner. Breath-taking. 67Anelka threatens to give us an action replay from the right, but he is blocked a little heavily (though legally, says the ref) and Denmark tidy up. 70 By cruel contrast, the Danes have lost what momentum they were building up at the start of the second half. A lumped ball over the top by Colding is pretty uninspiring stuff. 72 Double substitution for Denmark, roping off Bisgaard and Tofting and bringing on Martin Jorgensen and Thomas Gravesen. 76 Henry is off again and only a challenge by Colding on the goal line stops him from pulling it across for one of three waiting blue shirts. Henry looks awesome. 78 The fresh legged Jorgensen has a dip but his shot is woeful, nearly going out for a throw-in. 80 Substitution by Denmark, replacing the ineffective Tomasson with Mikkel Beck. 81 Henry squares a ball into Anelka's stride across the edge of the area but his shot is underhit into Schmeichel's gloves. 82 French substitution, Anelka coming off for Sylvian Wiltord. 83 A Danish freekick ends up at the feet of the scary-looking Schjonberg. His drive across the six-yard box is blocked somewhat masochistically by Lizerazu. 85 Brilliant play in midfield by France. First Wiltord plays a one-two with Deschamps to carry it out, then, having lost the ball, Petit wins it back before Neilsen could control it. 87 Schmeichel does just enough to stop Wiltord from clipping it past him after breaking through the middle. Zidanesticks the rebound on the Moon. 88 A little too much show-boating from Deschamps lets Jorgenesen have a go from 30 yards, but his shot is fielded well by Barthez. 91 Zidane wellies one hard and low right at Schmeichel and it is all he can do to parry it back out. 92 GOAL! France 3 - 0 Denmark Zidane slips it through to Viera who, confronted by Schmeichel, squares it to Wiltord who pushes it in easily. The scorer was certainly in an off-side position when the original ball was played through to Viera, but that would just be nit picking. 93 The ref puts Denmark out of their misery - full time: France 3 - 0 Denmark.",

      "body": "<p>More has been written about James Joyce's masterpiece Ulysses than any other literary work, though I think it's safe to say that hardly anyone has actually read it - in fact, according to my exhaustive research in the office, it seems to boil down to just me and a few other advanced people. Luckily, none of this has stopped millions of visitors turning up in Dublin every year to celebrate 'Bloomsday', held on 16 June - the day on which, in 1904, all the action in Ulysses takes place - and named after Leopold Bloom, one of the book's two main protagonists. The other is Stephen Dedalus, an undisguised Joyce in his early twenties. </p> <p>During the course of the novel, the pair each make their separate odysseys through the city, getting into minor social scrapes, the middle-aged Bloom musing on lunch, sex and unsavoury bodily functions, the young Stephen thinking about 'the ineluctable modality of the visible' (don't ask me) and other impenetrable bardic matters. </p> <p>Really, that's all you need to know to have a good Bloomsday, which in recent years has turned into a week-long festival of dressing-up, tours, performances and readings at various sites around Dublin germane to the plot, though mostly it's about zig-zagging fearlessly in the footsteps of our heroes, drinking Guinness, behaving indecorously and staying up too late. </p> <p>I am here ahead of the official revels to carry out my own important scholarly studies, accompanied by my old chum Jon, who was best man at my wedding and has selflessly agreed to come along and make sure I've got the map the right way up. </p> <p>Any aficionado's first stop has to be the Martello watchtower out in Sandycove, where Joyce was an unpaying guest. It features in the opening scene of the book in which Stephen is watching 'stately, plump Buck Mulligan' having a shave on the roof. The tower now houses the James Joyce Museum, and attracts visitors from all over the world (Jamie Lee Curtis dropped by the other week), so needless to say our taxi driver has to radio the office to see if anyone has heard of it. </p> <p>But when we get there it's interesting to see Joyce's guitar and his walking stick and his death mask, and the circular gunrest up the narrow spiral stone staircase with its view of Joyce's 'snotgreen' sea, though it doesn't look particularly green today. But I would defy anyone remotely 'plump' to get up these steps, and indeed it turns out that Oliver Gogarty - the real-life model for Buck Mulligan - was a person of unexceptional girthly dimensions in addition to being a minor poet, surgeon, self-styled wit, weekend aviator and the man who was paying the rent. </p> <p>We must infer that the reason Joyce made Buck fatter and more unpleasant was because Gogarty fired a gun over his guest's head when he was asleep, which in those days was the way to ask someone to leave. Confusingly, in Ulysses it's somebody else who fires the gun (read entire book for full details). Suffice to say, Joyce left the tower as soon as he could get his trousers on. </p> <p>Afterwards we take the Dart railway back into town. It's chucking it down now as we struggle across the O'Connell bridge, too preoccupied with having our eyes poked out by people's umbrellas to stand gawping at the spot where Bloom stopped to throw cake crumbs to the seagulls over the Liffey. We nip into the first pub we can find that boasts a completely barking, white-bearded toothless drunk, who keeps Jon busy with the manifold evils of grasping, bloodsucking women, while I peruse my dog-eared copy of Ulysses (well, dog-eared at the beginning, where I restarted it a million times in 1985). 'Are you an engineer?' our new friend suddenly demands, for reasons best known to his social worker. We make our polite escape to the next watering hole (next door, as it happens), where we eat a hearty Irish stew and have a couple of drinks to prepare us for the literary pub crawl due to start upstairs at the Duke, in Duke Street, at 7.30pm. </p> <p>The sun comes out. Hurray! But then it starts raining again. The tour kicks off with a few auld ballads and an amusing extract from Waiting for Godot performed by a pair of robust actorly types, whose repertoire teems with jokes, stories and readings from Yeats, Oscar Wilde and the like, as we wind in and out of O'Neill's and the Old Stand, back to the Duke and, finally, to Davy Byrne's, a 'moral pub', where Bloom enjoyed a mustardy gorgonzola sandwich and a glass of Burgundy before going off to buy a lewd book. </p> <p>We have just time to pop into a further 18 establishments around the riotous Temple Bar area before accidentally managing to find our hotel, by now so much cerebrally stimulated that we hardly notice that the rain has stopped. </p> <p>Next morning we're up early and as eager as you like to spend half the morning at the Writers' Museum with a full- lard fried eggs and black pudding breakfast churning about inside us, though it does take us a while to find the place with our eyes closed and every hammer drill in Dublin thudding through the city (to commemorate our visit, the council has decided to replace all the roads and pavements at the same time). But soon we are wandering around the hushed Georgian rooms with our audio-guides plugged in, leaning reverently forward to inspect the multifarious first editions, forewords, frontispieces and sundry programmes and playbills and pens and pipes, plus Samuel Beckett's typewriter and telephone, which has a red button on it that he could press to stop incoming calls when he wasn't feeling talkative, or perhaps just had a hangover, which is understandable. </p> <p>There's not much here about Joyce (who of course has a museum to himself), though I do find out that even at the age of 18 he was busy startling influential people with the ripeness of his mind. Ibsen sent him a gushing letter after Joyce had reviewed one of his plays. By the time Ulysses was published in 1922 he had the literary world at his feet peeling him grapes. Eliot agreed it was a masterpiece; Hemingway was an admirer; Faulkner was too awestruck even to speak to him; F. Scott Fitzgerald offered to jump out of the window to demonstrate his veneration (Joyce said it wouldn't be necessary). Only Virginia Woolf said the book was shite (or something like that). We have a half-hour cavity in our busy itinerary, but we find a brilliant corner newsagent's called the Candy Shop, where Jon gets a souvenir Ha'penny Bridge snowstorm for his girlfriend, and I buy a packet of tissues. We spend 20 minutes looking in the window, because it's not everywhere you can buy the Mirror, a large sliced loaf, a Russian army helmet, a leprechaun alarm clock, a 1962 hurling programme, a pocket-sized Life and Times of John F. Kennedy , a snooker cue, a Nottingham Forest scarf and a set of Singaporean stamps without moving from the counter. Obviously the Candy Shop sells Mars bars as well, but as favourite shops go, this one just about pips the one round the corner from our hotel called Why Go Bald!, which has a massive neon sign depicting a smiling man with his hair flashing on and off. </p> <p>We traipse down to the James Joyce Centre on North Great George's Street, which is preparing for Bloomsday. Here we meet Ken, a grand, tousled white-haired gent who shows us round, telling us stories about Joyce's father who drank away the family fortune, and of Nora Barnacle who eloped with Joyce to Paris on 16 June 1904 (hence the significance of that date). Ken is slightly anxious about the likely success of a new Bloomsday event based on the Nighttown brothel scene, which according to the blurb will be a 'hallucinatory pageant recreating the dementia of the drunken experience of reeling through Edwardian Dublin's red light district', though it sounds like a hit to me. </p> <p>I'm a bit slow to spot the clues during all this, but it turns out that James Joyce was Ken's uncle! How cool is that? Though, obviously, it was probably less cool when Ken was growing up in the Thirties and Forties and Joyce's name was Beelzebub in polite Dublin circles. I ask if he's seen Nora , the film about Nora Barnacle. He says it was quite good, though he was a bit alarmed when Ewan McGregor turned up before shooting to research the part. 'Very nice chap,' he says, 'but Joyce was a six-footer and Ewan McGregor is...' </p> <p>'Short?' </p> <p>'Well, yes, though they did make him look taller.' </p> <p>The Joyce Centre is not a museum, but there's a library where anyone can come and browse or carry out research, and a bookshop. The door from 7 Eccles Street is here (Bloom's address in the novel - the actual house was demolished); on the top floor is a gallery depicting the real-life Dubliners who appeared in Joyce's fiction under different names; then there's Joyce's furniture from his apartment in Paris; photographs of Joyce and family and his contemporaries. </p> <p>Ken is very good value, reciting passages from Ulysses and the truly bonkers Finnegan's Wake as we go along, obliging me to scrape the barrel of my memory to show I've been paying attention. 'Ah, that's in... er... what is it, isn't it? \"Lestry gonians\"? No, wait, the other one,' I say, starting to sound like one of Joyce's least punctuated interior monologues. It can be a difficult book, I say. Ken tells us even Matisse hadn't read it, and he was supposed to be doing the illustrations. 'He assumed it was a version of Homer's Odyssey ,' he says. Which apparently explains why everyone is wearing Grecian sandals. </p> <p>Jon intervenes with the theory that Ezra Pound went to the same barber as Brendan Behan, or at least one with a very similar sense of humour. </p> <p>Ken hands us over to his colleague, Lynn, who lends us a green umbrella and takes us for a walk through north inner-city Dublin, where the declining fortunes of the Joyce family were marked by a rapid succession of 14 different addresses, each less wholesome than the one before it. The last and therefore worst was in Fontenoy Street, a two-bedroom single-storey house. Obviously, they've done it up a bit now - and you have to think of it with a family of 11 living there - but I can't help wondering what the present occupiers think about us standing outside their living-room window discussing their house as an example of Edwardian urban squalor. Lynn assures us they don't mind. </p> <p>Anyway, it was here that Joyce wrote the filthy letters to Nora. I don't know about the filthy letters, so she reads one out. It is quite filthy. 'And there are filthier ones than this,' she says. We go to Eccles Street and look at the hospital that used to be number seven. Here we have to imagine Bloom coming out, crossing to the sunny side ('avoiding the loose cellarflap of Number 75') and up to the corner to buy some offal for breakfast. We hear the famous extract about Bloom liking 'the inner organs of beasts', especially 'grilled mutton kidneys, which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine'. Yum. </p> <p>Entirely by chance we get back to the hotel in time for a short nap and the afternoon highlights of England v Brazil, before heading out to research some more pubs with Joycean credentials. We go to the ancient Brazen Head (where Ulysses promises 'a decent enough do') and the Ormond, where the 'Sirens' chapter was set ('best value in Dublin') and end up propping up the Octagon Bar at the Clarence, an elegant hotel part-owned by U2's Bono, and a hip designer retreat from the 'colourful' slappers'n'lads scene of Temple Bar. </p> <p>To be honest, it's not until afterwards that I find the Clarence is even mentioned in Ulysses . Maybe they're all in there somewhere. As Bloom says: 'Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub'. On the other hand Bloom is not much of a drinker. As every schoolboy knows, 'he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon and full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour's glass and his neighbour nist not of his wile'. </p> <p>Whatever that means... </p> <p><strong>Festival diary</strong></p> <p><strong> Tomorrow until Thursday</strong> City walking tours following Ulysses, 2pm, James Joyce Centre.

The door from 7 Eccles Street is here (Bloom's address in the novel - the actual house was demolished); on the top floor is a gallery depicting the real-life Dubliners who appeared in Joyce's fiction under different names; then there's Joyce's furniture from his apartment in Paris; photographs of Joyce and family and his contemporaries. Ken is very good value, reciting passages from Ulysses and the truly bonkers Finnegan's Wake as we go along, obliging me to scrape the barrel of my memory to show I've been paying attention. 'Ah, that's in... er... what is it, isn't it? \"Lestry gonians\"? No, wait, the other one,' I say, starting to sound like one of Joyce's least punctuated interior monologues. It can be a difficult book, I say. Ken tells us even Matisse hadn't read it, and he was supposed to be doing the illustrations. 'He assumed it was a version of Homer's Odyssey ,' he says. Which apparently explains why everyone is wearing Grecian sandals. Jon intervenes with the theory that Ezra Pound went to the same barber as Brendan Behan, or at least one with a very similar sense of humour. Ken hands us over to his colleague, Lynn, who lends us a green umbrella and takes us for a walk through north inner-city Dublin, where the declining fortunes of the Joyce family were marked by a rapid succession of 14 different addresses, each less wholesome than the one before it. The last and therefore worst was in Fontenoy Street, a two-bedroom single-storey house. Obviously, they've done it up a bit now - and you have to think of it with a family of 11 living there - but I can't help wondering what the present occupiers think about us standing outside their living-room window discussing their house as an example of Edwardian urban squalor. Lynn assures us they don't mind. Anyway, it was here that Joyce wrote the filthy letters to Nora. I don't know about the filthy letters, so she reads one out. It is quite filthy. 'And there are filthier ones than this,' she says. We go to Eccles Street and look at the hospital that used to be number seven. Here we have to imagine Bloom coming out, crossing to the sunny side ('avoiding the loose cellarflap of Number 75') and up to the corner to buy some offal for breakfast. We hear the famous extract about Bloom liking 'the inner organs of beasts', especially 'grilled mutton kidneys, which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine'. Yum. Entirely by chance we get back to the hotel in time for a short nap and the afternoon highlights of England v Brazil, before heading out to research some more pubs with Joycean credentials. We go to the ancient Brazen Head (where Ulysses promises 'a decent enough do') and the Ormond, where the 'Sirens' chapter was set ('best value in Dublin') and end up propping up the Octagon Bar at the Clarence, an elegant hotel part-owned by U2's Bono, and a hip designer retreat from the 'colourful' slappers'n'lads scene of Temple Bar. To be honest, it's not until afterwards that I find the Clarence is even mentioned in Ulysses . Maybe they're all in there somewhere. As Bloom says: 'Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub'. On the other hand Bloom is not much of a drinker. As every schoolboy knows, 'he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon and full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour's glass and his neighbour nist not of his wile'.

      "body": "<p>If Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituents want to inspect their MP's old stamping ground at the other end of the country, they have only to pay a quick visit to a website called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\" \"target=\"_NEW&quot;\">homedirectory.com</a>. There, by clicking on a 360 degree tour of Islington, they will find themselves in Richmond Crescent, N1, outside the Prime Minister's former house, where they can gaze up the street and zoom in on what was once the leader's drawing room window. </p> <p>The virtual tour is an internet application tailor-made for the business of buying, selling or renting property. Instead of relying on one carefully selected estate agent's photograph before deciding to visit a house, you can look around each of the main rooms at your leisure, having a good peek at the vendor's knick-knacks in the process. If you are moving to a strange city, you can look for a suitable neighbourhood from hundreds of miles away. And if you're renting a holiday cottage you can check it really is in a 'quiet, rural setting'. </p> <p>In the US, virtual tours have taken off in a big way for selling property. Potential buyers can view the outside of thousands of properties at sites such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\" \"target=\"_NEW&quot;\">realtor.com</a> and 'move' around up to a dozen different rooms inside. The idea is catching on fast in the UK. Using a system called Ipix, estate agent Winkworths has been offering 360 degree viewing for almost a year now, and has more than 100 properties that can be inspected with a virtual tour at any one time. </p> <p>Spokeswoman Lindsay Brown says: 'Nearly all our offices now have the equipment, and our people have been trained to take the pictures. We've even had people purchase properties from abroad without having actually visited them.' Winkworth offers the tour as a free service to its clients, but if you want to sell your own house over the internet, you can pay to have the pictures taken. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\" \"target=\"_NEW&quot;\">Houseweb.com</a>, a Cambridge-based internet site, has just launched a service that offers a virtual tour as part of an inclusive advertising package on its website for \u00a3199. Alternatively, you can pay \u00a3150 just to have the virtual tour pictures taken. Mark Desvaux, Houseweb's founder, says: 'The main advantage for buyers is that they can establish quickly whether a property is of interest. From the seller's point of view, it means you don't have to tidy your home for every viewing appointment, and you get fewer time wasters.' </p> <p>Homedirectory.com has concentrated largely on getting pictures of local neighbourhoods online (mainly of London districts, although it also has virtual tours of, among others, Edinburgh and Swansea). In total, it has more than 2,000 images which can be viewed in 360 degrees. Rupert Connelly, Homedirectory's chief executive, explains: 'It gives people a feel for the neighbourhood they might want to move to.' Homedirectory.com also offers virtual tours of individual homes, but Connelly says the take-up has been slow, possibly because property has been selling fast. He believes it will be more popular in a stagnant market. </p> <p>Having a virtual tour made is a simple process, involving a photographer visiting your home for about an hour.

      "bodyText": "If Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituents want to inspect their MP's old stamping ground at the other end of the country, they have only to pay a quick visit to a website called homedirectory.com. There, by clicking on a 360 degree tour of Islington, they will find themselves in Richmond Crescent, N1, outside the Prime Minister's former house, where they can gaze up the street and zoom in on what was once the leader's drawing room window. The virtual tour is an internet application tailor-made for the business of buying, selling or renting property. Instead of relying on one carefully selected estate agent's photograph before deciding to visit a house, you can look around each of the main rooms at your leisure, having a good peek at the vendor's knick-knacks in the process. If you are moving to a strange city, you can look for a suitable neighbourhood from hundreds of miles away. And if you're renting a holiday cottage you can check it really is in a 'quiet, rural setting'. In the US, virtual tours have taken off in a big way for selling property. Potential buyers can view the outside of thousands of properties at sites such as realtor.com and 'move' around up to a dozen different rooms inside. The idea is catching on fast in the UK. Using a system called Ipix, estate agent Winkworths has been offering 360 degree viewing for almost a year now, and has more than 100 properties that can be inspected with a virtual tour at any one time. Spokeswoman Lindsay Brown says: 'Nearly all our offices now have the equipment, and our people have been trained to take the pictures. We've even had people purchase properties from abroad without having actually visited them.' Winkworth offers the tour as a free service to its clients, but if you want to sell your own house over the internet, you can pay to have the pictures taken. Houseweb.com, a Cambridge-based internet site, has just launched a service that offers a virtual tour as part of an inclusive advertising package on its website for \u00a3199. Alternatively, you can pay \u00a3150 just to have the virtual tour pictures taken. Mark Desvaux, Houseweb's founder, says: 'The main advantage for buyers is that they can establish quickly whether a property is of interest. From the seller's point of view, it means you don't have to tidy your home for every viewing appointment, and you get fewer time wasters.' Homedirectory.com has concentrated largely on getting pictures of local neighbourhoods online (mainly of London districts, although it also has virtual tours of, among others, Edinburgh and Swansea). In total, it has more than 2,000 images which can be viewed in 360 degrees. Rupert Connelly, Homedirectory's chief executive, explains: 'It gives people a feel for the neighbourhood they might want to move to.' Homedirectory.com also offers virtual tours of individual homes, but Connelly says the take-up has been slow, possibly because property has been selling fast. He believes it will be more popular in a stagnant market. Having a virtual tour made is a simple process, involving a photographer visiting your home for about an hour. Each image is a composite of two 180 degree pictures taken with a 'fish-eye' lens, which are digitally joined together. The tour can usually be online within a couple of days. But it may not be right for every property. A pokey little flat could look even more pokey seen in 360 degrees on a computer screen.

It's all go!<br> <strong>3</strong> Second and third corners for Italy, already showing signs of life. Lots of running from the front two, Inzaghi and Totti.<br> <strong>5</strong> Turkey a shambles - Akyel clears for a fourth Italian corner.<br> <strong>6</strong> Totti hits the post but flagged off, anyway. Still, the Azzurri looking more than a little up for this.<br> <strong>8</strong> Davala tidies up, putting it behind for a fifth Italian corner. Comes out to Conte who cuts inside but his cross is hit more in hope than anything. Cleared.<br> <strong>9</strong> Turkey's first corner comes from nothing but ends up in Toldo's gloves without a sniff of a challenge.<br> <strong>11</strong> Italy's midfield, seen by the press as its weakness, is doing okay here. Once again, the ball is recycled and another corner forced. Again, though, the centre is wasted.<br> <strong>13</strong> A seventh Italian corner fizzes across the area. Turkish hearts a-flutter.<br> <strong>14</strong> First direct shot on goal comes from Turkey, funnily enough. Sergen's effort from 18 yards curls wide.<br> <strong>17</strong> Totti's freekick goes right into the wall but it is sent back wide. Inzaghi then glances the follow-up cross wide with his head when power was needed. A soft miss.<br> <strong>19</strong> Totti forces a throw on the left, level with the Turkish penalty area, but it leads to nothing.<br> <strong>22</strong> Turkish freekick won wide on the left after a nice bit of skill from Abdullah. Comes to nothing - nice touch, though.<br> <strong>26</strong> Sergen has a header blocked after nice work freed Turkey down the left. Turkey coming into this now.<br> <strong>27</strong> Jinky, Ginola-esque run from deep by Italy's Fiore, but no movement from the recently dormant Italian attack.<br> <strong>29</strong> Hakan Sukur jumps with Toldo as he tries to collect an over-hit through ball. The keeper just about tidies up, but Sukur's physical presence is definitely a threat.<br> <strong>30</strong> Once again Sukur gets a bit heavy but this time the Scottish ref isn't having any of it.<br> <strong>31</strong> Lively play from the Turks. Slide rule ball sets Sergen away, but blocked for a corner which, guess what, ends up with the keeper.<br> <strong>34</strong> Tayfun penalised halfway inside the Turkish half for over doing the hard stuff. Albertini pings it into the box, but pretty unimaginative use of set piece.<br> <strong>36</strong> Alpay cuts out a Maldini through ball. The Turkish stopper's looking composed.<br> <strong>37</strong> Alpay sorts it out again after Abdullah surrenders posession out on the left.<br> <strong>39</strong> Sukur wins a corner just by being among the Italians at a long throw. Toldo punches the resultant cross well away.<br> <strong>40</strong> Abdullah fouled out on the left. Sukur's marker reads it well and the ball is cleared.<br> <strong>41</strong> Italy break again, winning a corner whch Fiore hits hard and fast. It floats all the way over, via an unwitting Turkish defender's head, but a goal kick is given. Still, they've had plenty of corners in this half and they don't seem to want to do anything with them. Ingrates.<br> <strong>45</strong> Half-time: Turkey 0 - 0 Italy. An odd half drifts to an end, no time added by a referee who was recently immortalised in song by Glaswegian art-rockers, Mogwai.<br></p> <p><strong>46</strong> As in the first half, the Italians left waiting out on the retractable Arnhem pitch. Finally, though, the Turks emerge and kick off the second half.<br> <strong>47</strong> A little spurt through the Italian midfield by Sergen ended seemingly by a tap to the ankles, but play waved on.<br> <strong>48</strong> Turkey win a corner, well claimed by Toldo.<br> <strong>49</strong> Sukur once again keeping the Italin back pair busy with his presence alone on the edge of the Italian box, but the ball squirms away to safety.<br> <strong>50</strong> Maldini has to tackle Umit well, but then gets a rollocking from the young Italian keeper for clearing the subsequent throw when the keeper had it covered.<br> <strong>51</strong> Tayfur's low drive smothered comfortably by Toldo.<br> <strong>52 GOAL! Turkey 0 - 1 Italy</strong> Inzaghi mis-hits a shot across the goal which is only partly cleared, and Antonio Conte smartly puts the loose ball in the net with an overhead kick on the six-yard line.<br> <strong>54</strong> First Totti then Zambrotta cut in and take aim, the latter's effort flying well wide after Abdullah lazily let his man go on the Italian right.<br> <strong>56</strong> Tayfur just off-target with a chance similar to Conte's goal, volleying wide of Toldo's left post after Italy pondered on a Turkish freekick.<br> <strong>57</strong> Rustu's goal somehow survives as Totti hits the post and then Inzaghi has a tame rebound cleared off the line with the keeper elsewhere.<br> <strong>58</strong> Italy turning the screw. Albertini's lobbed shot deflected behind for a corner which is only just dealt with by the Turkish defence.<br> <strong>60</strong> Maldini less efficient on Umit this time, giving away a freekick out on the right... <strong>61 GOAL! Turkey 1 - 1 Italy</strong> ... which proves costly. The Italian defence, and Francesco Toldo in particular, caught by Okan's sneaky late run and header.<br> <strong>61</strong> Substitution for Italy, Mark Iuliano coming on for Gianluca Pessotto.<br> <strong>63</strong> Inzaghi in like a hawk as he is played through. Again, though, his underhit shot is cleared relatively comfortably by Alpay.<br> <strong>65</strong> Zambrotta's turn to put the frighteners on Turkey, Rustu down to his left.<br> <strong>69 GOAL! Turkey 1 - 2 Italy</strong> Well-taken penalty by Inzaghi after Ogun harshly adjudged by Dallas to have fouled the Italian forward.<br> <strong>72</strong> Lively run from Okan leads to a Turkish corner. Italy clear, though.<br> <strong>75</strong> Substitutions - Italy bring on Alessandro Del Piero for Fiore, with Tugay Kerimoglu replacing Umit Davala for Turkey a few seconds later.<br> <strong>76</strong> Del Piero announces his arrival with a swerving 30 yard freekick onto the underside of Rustu's bar. His defence finish the job for him, hacking it away.<br> <strong>76</strong> Italy's Conte stretchered off after coming off worst in a midfield challenge.<br> <strong>78</strong> More sloppy defending by Italy ends up with Sergen getting among the back me. Appeals for a penalty as the ball is awkwardly cleared fall on deaf Scottish ears.<br> <strong>78</strong> Substitution, Turkey bringing on Arif Erdem for a knackered Sergen.<br> <strong>79</strong> Inzaghi fires just wide having come in from the right.<br> <strong>80</strong> Toldo does well to palm the ball out from under his bar as an Abdullah cross loops deceptively.<br> <strong>82</strong> Substitution - Italy drag off Totti for a more defensive Angelo Di Livio. <br> <strong>87</strong> Di Livio brings the ball out, laying it off to Del Piero on the left of the Turkish area, but his shot is weak.<br> <strong>89</strong> Substitution - Turkey's last throw of the die, replacing scorer Okan with Galatasaray team-mate, Ergun.<br> <strong>90</strong> Del Piero shoots the ball high and wide from well inside the area.<br> <strong>91</strong> In the first of three added minute, Del Piero gets free behind the Turks but, having rolled it past Rustu, sees the Turks clear off the line for at least the third time today. In truth, it could have been a cricket score for Italy. Well, a Scrabble score, anyway.<br> <strong>93</strong> No goal! Di Livio's tap in ruled offside as he absent-mindedly strays with Italy attacking three on two. Italians annoyed, as well they might be.<br> <strong>94</strong> Italy have a slight late scare, Toldo apparently picking the ball up from an Italian team-mate's touch, but the 'pass' is deemed unintentional, and the Azzurri can probably relax ...<br> <strong>94</strong> Full time: Turkey 1 - 2 Italy</p>",

Referee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland) 1 min Italy's Filippo Inzaghi kicks off the Dutch half of Euro 2000. 2 First Francesco Toldo in sticks for Italy flaps at a Turkish through ball, then Italy break and force a (wasted) corner. It's all go! 3 Second and third corners for Italy, already showing signs of life. Lots of running from the front two, Inzaghi and Totti. 5 Turkey a shambles - Akyel clears for a fourth Italian corner. 6 Totti hits the post but flagged off, anyway. Still, the Azzurri looking more than a little up for this. 8 Davala tidies up, putting it behind for a fifth Italian corner. Comes out to Conte who cuts inside but his cross is hit more in hope than anything. Cleared. 9 Turkey's first corner comes from nothing but ends up in Toldo's gloves without a sniff of a challenge. 11 Italy's midfield, seen by the press as its weakness, is doing okay here. Once again, the ball is recycled and another corner forced. Again, though, the centre is wasted. 13 A seventh Italian corner fizzes across the area. Turkish hearts a-flutter. 14 First direct shot on goal comes from Turkey, funnily enough. Sergen's effort from 18 yards curls wide. 17 Totti's freekick goes right into the wall but it is sent back wide. Inzaghi then glances the follow-up cross wide with his head when power was needed. A soft miss. 19 Totti forces a throw on the left, level with the Turkish penalty area, but it leads to nothing. 22 Turkish freekick won wide on the left after a nice bit of skill from Abdullah. Comes to nothing - nice touch, though. 26 Sergen has a header blocked after nice work freed Turkey down the left. Turkey coming into this now. 27 Jinky, Ginola-esque run from deep by Italy's Fiore, but no movement from the recently dormant Italian attack. 29 Hakan Sukur jumps with Toldo as he tries to collect an over-hit through ball. The keeper just about tidies up, but Sukur's physical presence is definitely a threat. 30 Once again Sukur gets a bit heavy but this time the Scottish ref isn't having any of it. 31 Lively play from the Turks. Slide rule ball sets Sergen away, but blocked for a corner which, guess what, ends up with the keeper. 34 Tayfun penalised halfway inside the Turkish half for over doing the hard stuff. Albertini pings it into the box, but pretty unimaginative use of set piece. 36 Alpay cuts out a Maldini through ball. The Turkish stopper's looking composed. 37 Alpay sorts it out again after Abdullah surrenders posession out on the left. 39 Sukur wins a corner just by being among the Italians at a long throw. Toldo punches the resultant cross well away. 40 Abdullah fouled out on the left. Sukur's marker reads it well and the ball is cleared. 41 Italy break again, winning a corner whch Fiore hits hard and fast. It floats all the way over, via an unwitting Turkish defender's head, but a goal kick is given. Still, they've had plenty of corners in this half and they don't seem to want to do anything with them. Ingrates. 45 Half-time: Turkey 0 - 0 Italy. An odd half drifts to an end, no time added by a referee who was recently immortalised in song by Glaswegian art-rockers, Mogwai. 46 As in the first half, the Italians left waiting out on the retractable Arnhem pitch. Finally, though, the Turks emerge and kick off the second half. 47 A little spurt through the Italian midfield by Sergen ended seemingly by a tap to the ankles, but play waved on. 48 Turkey win a corner, well claimed by Toldo. 49 Sukur once again keeping the Italin back pair busy with his presence alone on the edge of the Italian box, but the ball squirms away to safety. 50 Maldini has to tackle Umit well, but then gets a rollocking from the young Italian keeper for clearing the subsequent throw when the keeper had it covered. 51 Tayfur's low drive smothered comfortably by Toldo. 52 GOAL! Turkey 0 - 1 Italy Inzaghi mis-hits a shot across the goal which is only partly cleared, and Antonio Conte smartly puts the loose ball in the net with an overhead kick on the six-yard line. 54 First Totti then Zambrotta cut in and take aim, the latter's effort flying well wide after Abdullah lazily let his man go on the Italian right. 56 Tayfur just off-target with a chance similar to Conte's goal, volleying wide of Toldo's left post after Italy pondered on a Turkish freekick. 57 Rustu's goal somehow survives as Totti hits the post and then Inzaghi has a tame rebound cleared off the line with the keeper elsewhere. 58 Italy turning the screw. Albertini's lobbed shot deflected behind for a corner which is only just dealt with by the Turkish defence. 60 Maldini less efficient on Umit this time, giving away a freekick out on the right... 61 GOAL! Turkey 1 - 1 Italy ... which proves costly. The Italian defence, and Francesco Toldo in particular, caught by Okan's sneaky late run and header. 61 Substitution for Italy, Mark Iuliano coming on for Gianluca Pessotto. 63 Inzaghi in like a hawk as he is played through. Again, though, his underhit shot is cleared relatively comfortably by Alpay. 65 Zambrotta's turn to put the frighteners on Turkey, Rustu down to his left. 69 GOAL! Turkey 1 - 2 Italy Well-taken penalty by Inzaghi after Ogun harshly adjudged by Dallas to have fouled the Italian forward. 72 Lively run from Okan leads to a Turkish corner. Italy clear, though. 75 Substitutions - Italy bring on Alessandro Del Piero for Fiore, with Tugay Kerimoglu replacing Umit Davala for Turkey a few seconds later. 76 Del Piero announces his arrival with a swerving 30 yard freekick onto the underside of Rustu's bar. His defence finish the job for him, hacking it away. 76 Italy's Conte stretchered off after coming off worst in a midfield challenge. 78 More sloppy defending by Italy ends up with Sergen getting among the back me. Appeals for a penalty as the ball is awkwardly cleared fall on deaf Scottish ears. 78 Substitution, Turkey bringing on Arif Erdem for a knackered Sergen. 79 Inzaghi fires just wide having come in from the right. 80 Toldo does well to palm the ball out from under his bar as an Abdullah cross loops deceptively. 82 Substitution - Italy drag off Totti for a more defensive Angelo Di Livio. 87 Di Livio brings the ball out, laying it off to Del Piero on the left of the Turkish area, but his shot is weak. 89 Substitution - Turkey's last throw of the die, replacing scorer Okan with Galatasaray team-mate, Ergun. 90 Del Piero shoots the ball high and wide from well inside the area. 91 In the first of three added minute, Del Piero gets free behind the Turks but, having rolled it past Rustu, sees the Turks clear off the line for at least the third time today. In truth, it could have been a cricket score for Italy. Well, a Scrabble score, anyway. 93 No goal! Di Livio's tap in ruled offside as he absent-mindedly strays with Italy attacking three on two. Italians annoyed, as well they might be. 94 Italy have a slight late scare, Toldo apparently picking the ball up from an Italian team-mate's touch, but the 'pass' is deemed unintentional, and the Azzurri can probably relax ... 94 Full time: Turkey 1 - 2 Italy",

      "body": "<p>I have a confession to make. What I'm about to tell you would be considered shameful in some circles, like owning an Engelbert Humperdinck boxed set. But here goes: I like ros\u00e9 wines. Before I get drummed out of the International Federation of Cork Dorks, perhaps I should explain. I might not drink them on a daily, or even monthly, basis, but there are times when nothing else tastes quite as good. If the summer ever gets started, you'll know what I mean. Good ros\u00e9s combine the fragrance and freshness of a white with the structure of a lighter red. </p> <p>The amusing Bluffer's Guide to Wine (Ravette Publishing, \u00a32.99) dismisses pink wines as an irrelevance. Most supermarket buyers feel the same way: 'They're a blip in the summer,' one told me with all the enthusiasm of a career gravedigger. 'If we didn't stock any, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Nobody is very interested.' </p> <p>Until very recently, I was a pinkophobe too. The stuff on the market from Anjou, Portugal and the south of France was pallid, boring or cloyingly sweet. So what's changed? Two things, in my view. The first is that producers have started to take pink wines more seriously, giving them as much attention as their reds and whites, rather than treating them as frivolous sidelines destined for the nearest ice bucket or posing pouch.

      "bodyText": "I have a confession to make. What I'm about to tell you would be considered shameful in some circles, like owning an Engelbert Humperdinck boxed set. But here goes: I like ros\u00e9 wines. Before I get drummed out of the International Federation of Cork Dorks, perhaps I should explain. I might not drink them on a daily, or even monthly, basis, but there are times when nothing else tastes quite as good. If the summer ever gets started, you'll know what I mean. Good ros\u00e9s combine the fragrance and freshness of a white with the structure of a lighter red. The amusing Bluffer's Guide to Wine (Ravette Publishing, \u00a32.99) dismisses pink wines as an irrelevance. Most supermarket buyers feel the same way: 'They're a blip in the summer,' one told me with all the enthusiasm of a career gravedigger. 'If we didn't stock any, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Nobody is very interested.' Until very recently, I was a pinkophobe too. The stuff on the market from Anjou, Portugal and the south of France was pallid, boring or cloyingly sweet. So what's changed? Two things, in my view. The first is that producers have started to take pink wines more seriously, giving them as much attention as their reds and whites, rather than treating them as frivolous sidelines destined for the nearest ice bucket or posing pouch. It's taken a long time, but ros\u00e9s have finally come over all respectable. They're even recognised as great food wines.

      "body": "<p>The brash, loud red of the strawberry is a wake-up call for the start of the scarlet-fruit season - those 12 weeks of the year when tiny red fruit comes at us nonstop, from the crisp-fleshed early cherries to the velvety late-season raspberries. The cheap hooker of the fruit world it may be, but the strawberry never fails to get my attention, and once June is upon us, it is not long before I fall for the vulgar delights of a strawberry tart. </p> <p>Strawberries, cream and crisp pastry is a once-a-year treat in my house. It may come in the form of a tiny shortcrust tartlet filled with a mixture of cream cheese and cream, piled high with sliced fruit, or a flaky concoction of puff pastry, wobbly custard and icing sugar. Last year, I made wafer-thin shortcakes and sandwiched them with thick yogurt and the ubiquitous Elsanta strawberries. Before that, I had a brief passion for thick American strawberry shortcake - albeit the tombstone of the strawberry-tart world. </p> <p>Perhaps the most glamourous are the tarts the size of a wheel that you see in Parisian pastry shops, filled with cr\u00e8me ptissi\u00e8re, their huge berries imprisoned in glossy redcurrant glaze. I am not fond of sticky jam coverings on fruit tarts, but I do like the thick custard filling - especially as it is such a fag to make at home. </p> <p>The good thing about making such things in your own kitchen is that you can experiment with recipes for the more fragile pastry that would probably come to grief in the commercial world. No shop assistant to lift the delicate crust from window to cardboard box, and no journey home perilously perched on someone's lap in a warm car. At home, we can roll out pastry as light as we dare, as it only needs to make the short trip from plate to lips. </p> <p>The perfect strawberry tart is a finely judged assembly of crumbling pastry, luscious fruit and deep, creamy filling. It must be fragile. So much so that you can barely pick it up. The pastry should break between your fingers. It need not always be filled with the traditional pastry cream made from eggs, milk and sugar; it could be something less sweet and with a bit of a tang to it, such as double cream mixed with fromage frais or yogurt. As I said, I don't go a bundle on those bright, jammy glazes so favoured by pastry chefs, so I use a fine dusting of icing sugar. The choice is yours, I guess. </p> <p>If our once-a-year orgy of berries and cream is to be memorable, then the pastry must be more interesting than an old-fashioned shortcrust. Maybe try a nut crust for a fruit tart - that is, pastry to which you have added ground hazelnuts or almonds? Nuts of any sort have an affinity with berries (and with stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots), and help to make the pastry even more crumbly. I sometimes add a few chopped pistachios to my strawberries, too. </p> <p>The idea is to provide a pastry that does little more than support the fruit - it should, I think, be so thin and crisp as to be almost invisible. The bonus here is that pastry such as this barely lasts five minutes when filled with fruit and laden with cream. So you have no choice but to wolf it almost as soon as it is made. </p> <p>The classical filling for any red-fruit tart is cr\u00e8me ptissi\u00e8re, that thick, creamy yellow custard thickened with a little flour. I do like this, even though it is a bore to make. It would, of course, be easy to fill your pastry with nothing more than a giant blob of whipped cream, but I find this overwhelms the berries, like a newborn baby in a king-size bed. Smarten it up with a half-quantity of mascarpone or cr\u00e8me frache, and you have something with an edge to it that will flatter rather than smother the fruit. </p> <p>Perhaps the cutest little tart of all is one made with wild strawberries - fraises de bois. When I finally get round to getting the garden done, a patch of these tiny, heavily seeded berries will be one of the first things to go in. Not that I have ever cooked with them; they tend not to make it as far as the kitchen. But for the next few weeks at least, the big red cultivated berry it will have to be - and for me there is no better place for them than all wrapped up with pastry and cream. </p> <h2>Strawberry tart</h2> <p><strong> Almond pastry</strong> </p> <p>A crisp and crumbly pastry (which I sometimes use for frangipani-filled tarts). This is enough for a 25cm tart tin with shallow sides, or 20 small fruit tarts.

It should look like breadcrumbs. Stir in the ground almonds and the sugar and add the egg yolk. Mix everything with your hands and squeeze together gently to form a soft ball of dough. </p> <p>Roll the dough into a short, thick sausage, then cut thin round slices from it. Use the slices to line a 25cm (or thereabouts) tart tin with shallow sides, pushing the pieces together with your fingers. You could, if you are dexterous, roll the pastry and lift it in by hand, patching where necessary, but I find the former method easier with a very short pastry. </p> <p>Prick the pastry case all over with a fork, then put in the fridge to rest for half an hour. This will stop it shrinking when it gets in the oven. </p> <p>Bake the pastry case in a preheated oven at 180 C/gas mark 4 for 15 minutes or so, until it is pale biscuit-coloured. Cool in its tin, then carefully remove it and put it in a cooling rack. Small tart cases will need 12-15 minutes in the oven. </p> <p><strong> for the filling: <br>200ml double cream <br>200g thick live yogurt or faiselle or fromage frais <br>2 tsps icing sugar <br>1 drop of vanilla extract or 1 tsp rose-water </strong></p> <p><strong>to assemble the tart: <br>20 medium-sized strawberries <br>icing sugar </strong></p> <p>Place the cooled tart case on a serving plate, then spoon the filling inside, levelling it off with the back of a spoon.

      "body": "<p>Pity poor Edward Heathcote Amory. Last week, after a long day at work as a Daily Mail leader writer, he slumped down in front of the television and, as he tells it, chanced upon a game show called Naked Jungle, part of Channel 5's season celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of British naturism. All 10 of the contestants - five men and five women - were completely naked. So, too, was their host, Keith Chegwin, who presided over the proceedings wearing only a pith helmet. On his head. </p> <p>Heathcote Amory was so appalled that he insisted on joining an estimated audience of two million people to watch the entire hour-long programme, the better to write an editorial piece the next day describing it as 'a new milestone in the degradation of mainstream British television', which appeared complete with pictures taken from a video of the show, little black boxes scattered about the wonder fully saggy bodies on display to protect the readers from things they might not have seen before. </p> <p>How the paper came by these 'video grabs' was a mystery. Channel 5 did not send out any preview tapes because they did not want newspapers running these kinds of pictures, nor did the paper ask for a tape after the event. The answer came on Friday when a second piece appeared, this time by Leo McKinistry, once more carrying censored shots of Chegwin's portly frame under the headline 'Channel Filth'. For the sake of journalism, McKinstry announced, he had been watching Channel 5's output for four weeks now so that he could examine the station's 'grotesque exercise in vulgarity' before listing all the things - reviews of porn flicks, an adult hypnotism show, the softest of softcore that Hollywood can deliver - that this exercise comprises. </p> <p>Exactly how scandalised other viewers were by the sight of Chegwin's penis remains to be seen. By the end of last week the Independent Television Commission had received just one complaint from a viewer who said he could 'do without Keith Chegwin prancing around'. An ITC spokesman said it did not believe there was anything in its codes about the choice of Chegwin as a presenter. As to the content of the show itself: 'Late-night nudity in a non-sexual context and in a programme that is well signposted may not be in breach of the programme codes.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the war of Keith Chegwin's penis fits neatly into a noble two- pronged tradition, both of nudity in British culture and of the press getting tumescent with fury about it. Last week one newspaper was describing David Elstein, head of Channel 5, as Britain's 'pornographer in chief', an honour previously bestowed upon Michael Grade and Michael Jackson, former and current controllers of Channel 4, for the perceived excesses of programmes such as The Word , and Eurotrash or the Red Light Zone strand. 'Newspapers are happy to put an admiring picture of Joely Richardson in a skimpy dress on their front page,' says Dawn Airey, Channel 5's controller of programmes. 'They'll give acres of space to the women from the WI posing naked for a calendar. But then something like this comes along and they decide it's an outrage.' </p> <p>As to more general criticisms of the channel's output, Airey was dismissive. 'The adult material comprises less than 2 per cent of our schedule,' she said. 'And we can make a very clear intellectual defence of it. We don't say this is art or high-minded. It's just erotica for erotica's sake.' It was, she said, in the spirit of the Carry On movies and naughty seaside postcards. </p> <p>Certainly Britain's current crop of adult-orientated programmes has a fine history. It dates back two decades to 1981 and Chris Tarrant's Over The Top - known as OTT - a late-night version of the kids' programme Tiswas , in which scantily dressed women had custard pies thrown at them. </p> <p>Soon naked people were turning up on prime-time television in the Six O'Clock Show , a Friday evening London TV magazine programme hosted by Michael Aspel. 'That's probably where the present trend started,' says Charlie Parsons of Planet 24, the company behind The Word and The Big Breakfast , who was a producer on the Six O'Clock Show . 'We used to do lots of items about nudists. You'd always cover them up with a strategically placed tea pot or something like that.' </p> <p>In the Nineties, instead of being labelled as good coarse fun, this kind of programming was now tagged as ironic. 'Any nudity became justified as a postmodern approach to the culture of the Carry On films rather than as the real thing,' says Parsons. 'Which of course was just an excuse for titillation.' </p> <p>Doubtless this is true. In 1998, BBC2 controller Mark Thompson described a series called Naked , about the human body sans clothes, as 'more about identity than salaciousness'; similarly Touch and Go , a torrid BBC drama about wife-swapping, was, he said, expressing 'a fascination with relationships'. </p> <p>Keith Chegwin, Parsons says, fits perfectly into an ironic postmodern culture. He had been a children's TV presenter in the Seventies whose career - and celebrity marriage to fellow presenter Maggie Philbin - had both collapsed after he descended into alcoholism. Parsons rescued him by booking him for an item on The Word in an ironic homage to Seventies children's television which eventually turned into a slot on The Big Breakfast . </p> <p>However, in televisual, terms what defines Chegwin's (naked) move from Channel 4 to Channel 5 - and indeed the whole of Channel 5's adult output - is the death of all that postmodern irony. Channel 5 simply doesn't bother with it. Indeed, Naked Jungle would have been oddly familiar to anybody who has seen evening television in, say, Spain or Italy, both of which have a soft spot for game shows full of nudity. </p> <p>'We clearly have a problem with sex and nakedness in Britain which they don't have on the continent,' says Jeff Ford, controller of acquisitions for Channel 5. It came as little surprise to Ford that, after the broadcast of Naked Jungle , he received a call from a German TV company which wishes to acquire the format. </p> <p>The problem for Channel 5 is that nudity is such a contentious issue in Britain that it was always bound to be criticised whatever it did. Last week, shortly before Chegwin's fine body was to be presented to an eager public, the Freedom to be Yourself group, who campaign for the right to be naked where they like when they like, were protesting naked outside Brighton Pavilion. Like the Mail, they weren't impressed by Naked Jungle , though for entirely different reasons. 'The portrayal is exploitative,' said Vincent Bethell of the group.

If you put your hands inside a cardoon (you mean to say you have never done this?) you can, in our garden, pull out more snails from a single leaf than your hands will carry. Young, otherwise healthy cardoon plants can be eaten through overnight, leaving a frayed stub surrounded by chewed-off leaves. </p> <p> If they just stuck to cardoons I would plant a thicket for them, but there are few things they will not nibble. So I go through periods of loathing the little buggers. But... Here am I creating a wildly unnatural food supply for them and they are merely responding as they know how. If I were to leave them be, the results would not be catastrophic. And they do serve a purpose. Slugs and snails eat all the waste and decaying vegetable matter that would otherwise attract and foster disease and fungal attacks. They love wet, stringy tissue best - young cardoons, lettuces, comfrey - but will try most things. Leave some comfrey or cardoon leaves on the ground near your lettuces or young cosmos seedlings (I have seen a tray of healthy cosmos reduced to chewed matchsticks in the greenhouse overnight) and they will go for those first. This also makes them very useful in the compost heap. Slugs will happily spend their days munching through it all, including any cardboard that you add, processing your waste and representing it as finely digested slug poo. A healthy compost heap should be teeming with slugs, woodlice, brandlings and other invertebrates, all greedily recycling your waste. All these animals are vital, because the equation is beautifully simple: the more compost you can produce, the better. </p> <p> And of course all these waste-eaters are important food for thrushes, hedgehogs, foxes, toads, ground beetles, ducks and chickens. Ten years ago it would have been necessary in a piece such as this to explain the food chain. Now we are all familiar with it, yet the avid chemical gardener still behaves as though their garden were in a loop quite outside the circle. This is silly and self-centred: no garden is an island. To everything non-human in the garden, your carefully preserved boundaries are merely objects in the landscape. The most obvious result of this is that you will share the wildlife - good and bad - of your neighbours, be they industrial, agricultural or horticultural. What I find interesting is when people plant up an urban or suburban back garden in as tropical a manner as possible. Where do they think the pollinators will be? In creating an environment that hosts none of the wildlife it is designed to support, they are also making an area that is less than friendly to all the local wildlife. A double whammy. </p> <p>This is not to say that one should self-consciously plant up the garden only with native plants. Gardens are never less than artifice, particularly 'wild' gardens. But it does make sense to create an environment where local ecology feels at home. This is likely to include some grasses to provide seeds and pollen. It would also feature a selection of umbellifers such as angelica, fennel, chervil or dill - all of which are rich in nectar and particularly attractive to hoverflies and lacewings, whose larvae in turn eat aphids. Stinging nettles are essential food for the caterpillars of nymphalid butterflies, so every garden should have a patch of carefully preserved nettles. And a typical suburban street is an ideal environment for songbirds and bees - if it is not drenched in chemicals and has a selection of indigenous plants. </p> <p> There is no need to be too gloomy about this. A well-stocked garden with a couple of mature trees and plenty of shrubs can support a far higher density of songbirds than a wood. In fact, most gardens are more wildlife-friendly than the average field, although far too many chemicals are still being used. I am sure all garden chemicals are a con trick to get you to part with your money: they do nothing to help your garden and everything to harm the ecology. Ditch the lot now and never buy any more. </p> <p> But to get your thrushes and blackbirds, you must have food for them in the shape of worms, invertebrates and insects. Indigenous species tend to support a much richer insect life than introductions. The London plane, for example, apparently only supports one insect species in Britain, whereas the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) supports 284 insect species. How many people plant oak trees in their garden? It is lovely from the first and gives enormous pleasure as it grows. </p> <p> Successful organic gardening depends on this interrelation of plant and animal life. It is a completely holistic system and, if managed properly, will attain its own balance. This cannot possible happen if man blitzes certain pests when they arise. You need some aphids if you are to have ladybirds or lacewings, and you need slugs if hedgehogs and toads are to visit your garden. Each predator must have enough to feed on to maintain their controlling presence. Then, if and when there is an explosion of one particular 'pest', the predatory population will respond. </p> <p> It is an entirely self-regulating system and it works fine. But the gardener can help. The most important thing is to have healthy plants. A healthy plant grows strongly enough to survive attack. Of course 'healthy' does not mean a plant that is being forced into unnatural vigour by over-feeding. That simply makes it ideal fodder for aphids, slugs and anything else that feeds off sappy, young growth. Let your garden plants adapt to your soil and grow at their own pace. Overcrowding is another source of all kinds of problems, and yet a good garden should feel packed to the gunnels. The answer is to avoid the massed effect created by lots of weedy little plants and to plant in groups, so that each individual plant has the space to grow healthily and yet, when mature, is jostling its neighbours without crowding them out. </p> <p> Don't tidy up too much. There is a balance to be struck between the kind of order most people need in their gardens, with healthy plants pruned and supported, and dead vegetation gathered, and enough overgrown and dying vegetation to support the full range of wildlife that the garden needs. Don't cut all your grass short. Have at least a patch that you cut just twice a year. Apart from anything else, this will encourage wildflowers, which will increase insect diversity. And diversity is the key. A healthy garden has as wide a range of insects, birds and mammals as possible. </p> <p> There are two animals that, as far as I can see, serve no use to the gardener whatsoever. The first is the rat - which is much more prevalent in gardens than most people admit - and the second is the mole. Compared to rats, moles are charming creatures, but are an absolute pain in the garden, as they eat precious worms and do phenomenal amounts of damage in border and lawn alike.</p>",

Here, the empire has struck back with a vengeance, as a cursory glance at recent Booker Prize short-lists confirms. If it were not for the English literatures of Australia, India, Canada and South Africa, we would be living in a literary Lilliput. Indeed it is only possible to construct a plausible narrative of contemporary 'English literature' if (to name some of the most obvious) you conjure the names of Ben Okri, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo, Vikram Seth, Upamanyu Chatterjee, Rohinton Mistry, Hanif Kureishi, Michael Ondaatje, and now the impressive newcomer Zadie Smith, whose remarkable debut White Teeth was passed over by the Orange Prize this week. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that in the last 25 years only one novel truly matches up to Dr Raine's prescription: Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (with Martin Amis's Money and Ian McEwan's Enduring Love as distinguished runners-up). </p> <p>There are many criticisms you can make of Rushdie's work, but you cannot deny its originality.

(Arguably, Martin Amis did the same with Money .) Say what you like about Amis and Rushdie, but most of the other new writers published in the last 30 years sound like someone else, and certainly not like themselves.

Here, too, originality is hard to come by. It is a commonplace of this discussion that there are, indeed, only three, or seven, or 10, basic plots in literature. </p> <p>Shakespeare, as all the leader writers have pointed out, 'depended' heavily on Plutarch and Holinshed.

Sooner or later, the consequences of policy towards the pound becomes the decisive political issue of the day. The euro promises to be no different.</p> <p>Suddenly, what has been obvious to the economic cognoscenti is entering the political mainstream. The moment is arriving when it will be clear that Gordon Brown's five economic tests to allow Britain to join the euro will be comfortably passed. The conjunction of an approaching election, growing restiveness among pro-Europeans that the Government has been inadequate in making the case for the euro and Britain's economic convergence with Europe is making the issue jump to life. The Chancellor wanted to negotiate the next 12 months as the Government has the last, saying as little as possible so that there were no hostages to fortune in the run-up to the election. Events are moving so quickly that the debate is moving beyond such control.</p> <p>Paradoxically, his difficulty is that the British economy is performing very well, a truth underlined by the OECD report on the UK published last week. The Treasury was pleased the Paris- based government club of economic forecasters' verdict on Britain was that our economic track record and prospects were in some respects enviable, but less happy that the OECD felt able to say that Britain was better qualified to be a member of the euro than some of its principal members. On inflation and unemployment alone, we could handle membership of the euro, but what now seems clear is that Brown is delivering what he promised, an economy less prone to boom and bust and which could sit comfortably in the eurozone.</p> <p>With the interest-rate gap between Britain and the euro area now 1.75 per cent and likely to narrow further, the only remaining technical obstacle to Britain joining the euro is the exchange rate.

      "bodyText": "Every post-war government has been hit by it in the end - and New Labour is about to enter its own travails. Sooner or later, the consequences of policy towards the pound becomes the decisive political issue of the day. The euro promises to be no different. Suddenly, what has been obvious to the economic cognoscenti is entering the political mainstream. The moment is arriving when it will be clear that Gordon Brown's five economic tests to allow Britain to join the euro will be comfortably passed. The conjunction of an approaching election, growing restiveness among pro-Europeans that the Government has been inadequate in making the case for the euro and Britain's economic convergence with Europe is making the issue jump to life. The Chancellor wanted to negotiate the next 12 months as the Government has the last, saying as little as possible so that there were no hostages to fortune in the run-up to the election. Events are moving so quickly that the debate is moving beyond such control. Paradoxically, his difficulty is that the British economy is performing very well, a truth underlined by the OECD report on the UK published last week. The Treasury was pleased the Paris- based government club of economic forecasters' verdict on Britain was that our economic track record and prospects were in some respects enviable, but less happy that the OECD felt able to say that Britain was better qualified to be a member of the euro than some of its principal members. On inflation and unemployment alone, we could handle membership of the euro, but what now seems clear is that Brown is delivering what he promised, an economy less prone to boom and bust and which could sit comfortably in the eurozone. With the interest-rate gap between Britain and the euro area now 1.75 per cent and likely to narrow further, the only remaining technical obstacle to Britain joining the euro is the exchange rate. The treaty says that a prospective member needs two years of currency stability at a rate of proven durability and the current oscillations are far from that. Yet some further strength in the euro and weakness in the pound will see that hurdle passed. Sterling will have moved into the economic holding pen from which it could enter the euro if the country so willed. Within the Cabinet, the argument has been joined with growing passion.

Craig was shot dead in October 1988. The UDA said he was colluding with the IRA. However, the former FRU soldier who operated undercover in Northern Ireland says his fate was sealed by a leaked RUC video, showing the UDA leader meeting with a senior Belfast IRA man in a Catholic bar. The ex-soldier claims that officers at the FRU's base in Army headquarters at Thiepval barracks, Lisburn, gave the video to Nelson, who had infiltrated the UDA. The ex-FRU soldier's allegations are to be given to Sir John Stevens, the former deputy chief constable of Cambridgeshire, in charge of investigating claims of collusion between the British Army and loyalist terrorists. Speaking from a secret location in Europe, the former undercover soldier said: 'The RUC's anti-terrorist surveillance unit, E4A, had filmed a meeting between Craig and this Provo from Unity Flats in the bar in the Markets area.

It's an amazing turnaround to find that a player who refused to train for Real Madrid is only too willing to play in an unglamorous practice match for France's reserves against a team made up of a selection from Croatia's Second Division in the suburbs of Zagreb. He scored a hat-trick. He smiled. He wants to be part of the mission in Holland and Belgium.</p> <p>For the first time in France's history they are favourites for a tournament outside their own land. Not only because they are the World Champions but because they are the team of 1998 plus strikers. They have evolved. </p> <p>'We are better then 1998,' chirps Lebeouf. Indeed they seem in ideal shape: the first choice defence has nearly 400 caps between them, the midfield are proven winners, and the attack brims with youthful vigour. </p> <p>It wasn't too long ago that frustration was welling up about the dearth of striking talent. Everybody admits they were lucky to win the World Cup with Stephane Guivarc'h leading the charge, and only eight months ago the front cover of France Football blared the following advertisement: 'Urgent... France is desperately seeking a goalscorer.' </p> <p>Anelka, having been hailed as the answer when his brace ripped through England at Wembley, had lost his form to a niggling combination of arrogance and injury. Thierry Henry was quietly acclimatising to a central role. David Trezeguet had never quite turned raw potential into the real deal. Now, to France's delight, all three have the makings of world-beaters and coach Roger Lemerre is spoilt for choice.</p> <p>Henry seems to be the slight favourite, although Trezeguet had a recent spell with the midas touch and Anelka simply has star quality and a taste for the big occasion. </p> <p>'Competition is healthy', as the trio of strikers have all been heard saying recently, is the new mantra. But continuity is the foundation. Unforseen injuries and suspensions permitted, if Lemerre had to pick a team to win any given game eight players would know for sure they are in. </p> <p>Barthez in goal, protected by the defensive core of Desailly and Laurent Blanc with Deschamps and Petit just up ahead. Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu get the nod as roaming full backs par excellence. Zidane, of course, is guaranteed. That leaves three attacking berths up for grabs and this is where Lemerre's selection becomes interesting. </p> <p>One of the three out and out strikers plays for definite. One of Robert Pires, Christophe Dugarry, Youri Djorkaeff or Johan Micoud will create from deep alongside Zidane. And the last place? That's the big debate. Will he play another attacker, or another playmaker, or Wiltord, who is something in between? Over to you Roger. </p> <p>There's a mindboggling number of permutations and he is expected to mix and match according to the opposition. All will play a part, as they did two years ago. Talk of the national team seldom mentions a starting 11, or a 16 including a subs bench, but always the 22. Le vingt-deux. It is a magic number in France. Lebeouf summed up the mood persuasively: 'L'Equipe de France is like a drug.'</p> <p>The taste of breaking ground as French footballers has served to whet the appetite. Now they are World Champions they want to be the first team to claim both global and European supremacy, a feat never before accomplished, even by the great German, Dutch or Italian sides who have gone close. </p> <p>'It's fabulous to find ourselves facing a new challenge. It's another way of making football history for our country and for ourselves. This is our chance you see,' muses Zidane. </p> <p>As Desailly points out, 'Everyone in the group has desire, hunger. We all want to win Euro 2000 but we must be humble. Everything has its moment. We cannot think that just because we are World Champions we only need click our fingers to reach another final. We have to forget our victory in the World Cup to get moving again.'</p> <p>If France want it enough they have all the attributes to clinch the trophy named after one of their own, Henri Delaunay. Preparation for Euro 2000 was carefully planned to echo the formula for '98. Meeting up at Clairfontaine, then a spell in Tignes for some beneficial mountain air, before a trip to Morocco for some sunshine with a couple of warm-up games thrown in for good measure. For the tournament itself they are staying in a converted castle - not dissimilar to Clairfontaine - on a lake just outside Brussels. </p> <p>It's all deliberately familiar. Even 18 of the World Cup 22 are the same. For this generation of players France '98 is the eternal reference point, the catalyst, the pinnacle. That summer will forever be remembered as the time their nation fell in love with football. </p> <p>A passion suddenly bloomed, growing with every game.You could sense it in the Provencal market squares, hear it in the tabacs in Nantes, smell it in Lyonnaise cafes. Football gradually penetrated everyday life in France, and by the time Les Bleus reached the final the country was smitten. </p> <p>In the subsequent two years the people of France and its football team have drifted apart. League attendances are healthy and the legendary 22 still cause a stir wherever they go, but for your average monsieur et madame the summer of love ran its course. </p> <p>Success in the Low Countries would remind all the grannies why they had a soft spot for 'Zizou', bring a smile to the folically challenged every time Blanc kisses Barthez's bald head for luck, and get the hip hop kids wanting to be Anelka. </p> <p>How resonant it will be for Aime Jacquet, the architect who put this extraordinary group together and masterminded that golden period. He knows well the curiously fickle attitude to football in France: 'I hoped that every French man and woman would get behind the French team before the tournament began. </p> <p>'In reality, what happened was that Les Bleus were forced to prove themselves on the pitch. To prove that they truly were the talented performers, hungry for victory, that I'd been telling people about for ages.' </p> <p>Now to prove themselves all over again.</p>",

Everybody admits they were lucky to win the World Cup with Stephane Guivarc'h leading the charge, and only eight months ago the front cover of France Football blared the following advertisement: 'Urgent... France is desperately seeking a goalscorer.' Anelka, having been hailed as the answer when his brace ripped through England at Wembley, had lost his form to a niggling combination of arrogance and injury. Thierry Henry was quietly acclimatising to a central role. David Trezeguet had never quite turned raw potential into the real deal. Now, to France's delight, all three have the makings of world-beaters and coach Roger Lemerre is spoilt for choice. Henry seems to be the slight favourite, although Trezeguet had a recent spell with the midas touch and Anelka simply has star quality and a taste for the big occasion. 'Competition is healthy', as the trio of strikers have all been heard saying recently, is the new mantra. But continuity is the foundation. Unforseen injuries and suspensions permitted, if Lemerre had to pick a team to win any given game eight players would know for sure they are in. Barthez in goal, protected by the defensive core of Desailly and Laurent Blanc with Deschamps and Petit just up ahead. Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu get the nod as roaming full backs par excellence. Zidane, of course, is guaranteed. That leaves three attacking berths up for grabs and this is where Lemerre's selection becomes interesting. One of the three out and out strikers plays for definite. One of Robert Pires, Christophe Dugarry, Youri Djorkaeff or Johan Micoud will create from deep alongside Zidane. And the last place? That's the big debate. Will he play another attacker, or another playmaker, or Wiltord, who is something in between? Over to you Roger. There's a mindboggling number of permutations and he is expected to mix and match according to the opposition. All will play a part, as they did two years ago. Talk of the national team seldom mentions a starting 11, or a 16 including a subs bench, but always the 22. Le vingt-deux. It is a magic number in France. Lebeouf summed up the mood persuasively: 'L'Equipe de France is like a drug.' The taste of breaking ground as French footballers has served to whet the appetite. Now they are World Champions they want to be the first team to claim both global and European supremacy, a feat never before accomplished, even by the great German, Dutch or Italian sides who have gone close. 'It's fabulous to find ourselves facing a new challenge. It's another way of making football history for our country and for ourselves. This is our chance you see,' muses Zidane. As Desailly points out, 'Everyone in the group has desire, hunger. We all want to win Euro 2000 but we must be humble. Everything has its moment. We cannot think that just because we are World Champions we only need click our fingers to reach another final. We have to forget our victory in the World Cup to get moving again.' If France want it enough they have all the attributes to clinch the trophy named after one of their own, Henri Delaunay. Preparation for Euro 2000 was carefully planned to echo the formula for '98. Meeting up at Clairfontaine, then a spell in Tignes for some beneficial mountain air, before a trip to Morocco for some sunshine with a couple of warm-up games thrown in for good measure. For the tournament itself they are staying in a converted castle - not dissimilar to Clairfontaine - on a lake just outside Brussels. It's all deliberately familiar. Even 18 of the World Cup 22 are the same. For this generation of players France '98 is the eternal reference point, the catalyst, the pinnacle. That summer will forever be remembered as the time their nation fell in love with football. A passion suddenly bloomed, growing with every game.You could sense it in the Provencal market squares, hear it in the tabacs in Nantes, smell it in Lyonnaise cafes. Football gradually penetrated everyday life in France, and by the time Les Bleus reached the final the country was smitten. In the subsequent two years the people of France and its football team have drifted apart. League attendances are healthy and the legendary 22 still cause a stir wherever they go, but for your average monsieur et madame the summer of love ran its course. Success in the Low Countries would remind all the grannies why they had a soft spot for 'Zizou', bring a smile to the folically challenged every time Blanc kisses Barthez's bald head for luck, and get the hip hop kids wanting to be Anelka. How resonant it will be for Aime Jacquet, the architect who put this extraordinary group together and masterminded that golden period. He knows well the curiously fickle attitude to football in France: 'I hoped that every French man and woman would get behind the French team before the tournament began. 'In reality, what happened was that Les Bleus were forced to prove themselves on the pitch. To prove that they truly were the talented performers, hungry for victory, that I'd been telling people about for ages.' Now to prove themselves all over again.",

Known simply as Dimas, he has become a globetrotter at club level. Quick and lively, he has recaptured some of his earlier form since moving to Belgium last season. Undisputed choice at left-back.</p> <p><strong>Jorge Costa </strong><br>28 Porto. Caps: 26. The hard man of Porto and Portugal's defence, this uncompromising figure stands for no nonsense. He is just what Portugal need to stiffen their traditionally soft underbelly.</p> <p><strong>Fernando Couto</strong><br> 30 Lazio. Caps: 62/Goals:6. Couto was once a highly respected figure at the heart of Barcelona and Portugal's defence. Since his move to Lazio he has looked clumsy and out of place. This tall and temperamental centre-half will need to recapture his best form quickly. </p> <p><strong>Abel Xavier </strong><br>27 Everton. Caps: 13/Goals: 2. Xavier seems to have displaced regular right-back Secretario from the team. After being discarded by PSV Eindhoven, he has settled well at Everton. He is tough-tackling, versatile and dangerous going forward, too. It's just a shame about his hair style.</p> <p><strong>Paulo Bento </strong><br>30 Real Oviedo. Caps: 21.

Meanwhile, he remains a useful player who can anchor the midfield allowing his more creative team-mates to get forward. </p> <p><strong>Rui Manuel Costa</strong><br> 28 Fiorentina. Caps: 51/Goals: 18. Costa is generally considered as world class. He is a true playmaker in the old-fashioned sense. His passing is exquisite and he can switch the play between defence and attack with mesmerising smoothness. He is also very dangerous in front of goal.</p> <p><strong>Paulo Sousa</strong><br> 29 Parma. Caps: 44. Sousa is a player of great experience gained from playing in Germany and Italy. Sousa usually sits deep in midfield, helping Paulo Bento to snuff out opposing attacks, but also adding some good passing ability of his own.</p> <p><strong>Luis Figo</strong><br> 27 Barcelona. Caps: 59/Goals:13. Figo is genuinely world class. Some say he is the best in Europe at the moment. Two-footed, he can play on either wing and can also play just behind the striker. His crossing and dribbling are second to none and he is lethal when he gets near the goal.</p> <p><strong>Sergio Conceicao </strong><br>25 Lazio. Caps: 23/Goals: 2. Left winger Conceicao has been in good form, but has struggled to get into the national team recently. He should get the nod for Euro 2000. He is a hard-working player who can cut inside as well as attack down the wing.</p> <p><strong>Ricardo Sa Pinto</strong><br> 27 Real Sociedad. Caps: 36/Goals:8. In the absence of any natural goalscorer, Sa Pinto is the best option up front for Portugal. He is not tall for a centre-forward and will play as lone striker, so he will need support from his midfield team-mates. He will need to control his fiery temper.</p>",
