      "body": "<p>English visitors to Wrexham are accustomed to the feeling that indigenous folk in pubs and restaurants are making disparaging remarks behind their backs. But it is not something you expect when, like Robbie Savage, you are a local boy with a Welsh-speaking dad and have worn the red dragon on your chest. </p> <p>When you are brought up a Savage, however, it is not just headline writers who are unable to resist every opportunity to make a connection between name and nature. And if a few dodgy tackles on the football field have convinced some fans that he is the anti-Christ, Wrexham's less successful sons like to assuage their jealousy by portraying him as a typically flash footballer. </p> <p>Savage, 25, says: \"It's really sad because when I go back, I see all the same friends I had at school. Yet people want to believe the worst of me and it means I don't want to go home as much. The Wrexham fans even booed me when I played at the Racecourse Ground for Crewe.\" His Leicester manager Martin O'Neill believes his physical appearance encourages detractors to jump to instant, erroneous conclusions - the beach-blond hair, the designer sideburns and a suntan that is as permanent as Liz Hurley's. </p> <p>Even O'Neill admits a prejudice saying: \"He looks like he should be surfing in California and if there is one thing that annoys me about him, it's that tan. I know he hasn't been to Barbados because we haven't played there lately, so he must have been on the sunbed. As we approach February, I like players to have that drained, pale look that I've always had at this stage of the season.\" </p> <p>In an incestuous world like football, people form indelible value judgments about you on the flimsiest of evidence. Savage names three incidents: his part in the sending off of Justin Edinburgh in last season's Worthington Cup final which enraged Tottenham's players and fans; his challenge on Arsenal's Nwanko Kanu during this month's FA Cup tie; and his naivety in throwing down a shirt with Paolo Maldini's name on it before Wales played Italy, which led to him being sacked from, then recalled to, the national squad. </p> <p>Airing the name of Savage in front of Totttenham supporters provokes the same reaction as waving an Arsenal scarf in their faces. Yet he insists he is not a dirty player and learned to tackle only after joining Leicester. Perhaps that is part of the problem as he explains: \"At Crewe I played in midfield, just in front of the back four, and my job was to get the ball and give it to Danny Murphy, who could really play.\" </p> <p>His manager, who often forgets to remove his tongue from his cheek before speaking, says that all he lacks as a footballer is ability. \"He will never be able to pass a ball like Garry Parker did for us a few years back and he hasn't got electrifying pace.\" Neither, adds O'Neill, does he make mazy, nor even Muzzy Izzet dribbles, but \"he is improving as a player and he has galvanised us a couple of times when the team were on their knees. He has become an integral part of the side.\" </p> <p>Savage claims to have learned everything from O'Neill, even, it would seem, the timing of a punchline. Having played as wing-back in the first 14 games of last season, he was horrified when Leicester bought Andy Impey to play in his position. \"I wasn't happy but I am not a quitter and I believed there was room for both of us in the side. Now I tell the gaffer Impey's the best buy he ever made.\" </p> <p>Savage's self-deprecatory humour makes it difficult to view him as one of the game's bad boys. And though he appeared to have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth when he joined Manchester United and played alongside David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs in the side that won the FA Youth Cup, it quickly rusted in his jaws. </p> <p>Having played in every round of the Youth Cup, he was dropped to make way for Giggs in the final. A year later, when Alex Ferguson delivered the cruellest euphemism in football, telling Savage he was \"letting him go\", he added that he was certain he would make it elsewhere. </p> <p>Savage's head, though, was full of confusion as he drove home to Wales and he was unable to find the words to tell his parents. \"I went out with a mate to play snooker while I thought of how to tell them. But my mind must have been wandering and I crashed the car. I woke up in hospital to find mum and dad there and told them then.\" </p> <p>Savage will be snapping at the heels of Chelsea's expensive foreigners in tomorrow's fifth-round FA Cup tie but the way he talks about them, like a star-struck fan, seems to make a myth of the flash theory. </p> <p>He says: \"When we played at Stamford Bridge the other week, it was George Weah's first full game and it was fantastic to be on the same pitch.

      "body": "<p>Hats off to Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen, voted the three best players in the world in Fifa's recent poll. Well, at least they were by the Laos Under-20 coach Soutskhone Oudompet, the only one of 140 national-team coaches to vote exclusively for English players. There were other idiosyncratic choices: Bolivia's Manuel Reinaldo Bilches clearly hasn't seen Paulo Wanchope in action for a while. It also revealed the whereabouts of some forgotten characters. Willie McFaul, the former Newcastle United goalkeeper and manager, for example, is masterminding Guam's assault on the heights of world football. And Burma are the latest to grapple with the prose of the former Lincoln City manager Colin Murphy. If that doesn't make them clean up their human rights record, nothing will. </p> <p>\u0095 Quoting Murphy's programme notes is usually the last resort of the desperate football diarist, but the publication of a new history of Lincoln City makes it almost topical. Brian Halford's Past Imperfect takes Murphy's words as its guiding text: \"You, me, we all of us have been forced to breakfast on travesty, lunch on objection and insult, dine on inflicted pressure,\" the former City boss mused. Past Imperfect is a fine title, but Breakfasting On Travesty might have captured the essence of the Imps even better. </p> <p>\u0095Let's hope Soutskhone Oudompet wasn't watching Sky Digital's coverage of Manchester United v Arsenal on Monday night, which offered subscribers the chance to follow one player for 15 minutes at a time. One drawback became obvious when viewers watching Roy Keane found themselves lip-reading a mouthful of obscenities when Arsenal scored. Another, which would have disappointed Soutskhone, was that Andy Cole, picked as the next player in focus, was promptly substituted. Close-up footage of the pride of Laos donning his tracksuit: another coup for the digital revolution. </p> <p>\u0095The Cyprus FA is trawling the world for top-quality players qualified to represent the island. According to the French paper L'Equipe, the first two targets are Leicester City's Muzzy Izzet, whose Turkish background seems to make him a candidate, and the Watford teenager James Panayi. Look out world. </p> <p>\u0095The Diary's own performance-of-the-week award goes to Jack Lester, the Grimsby Town striker who has moved to Nottingham Forest. Lester took the trouble to post a message on a Grimsby internet mailing list, which read in part: \"I decided to send this message because I didn't just want to drift away without acknowledging the tremendous support I have had at Grimsby from the club, the management, the players, the other staff, the local press and radio, and of course the fans. Everyone has been an inspiration, in good times and bad.\" </p> <p>\u0095David Beckham is a huge animal, worth around \u00a3500. But don't take our word for it, that's the view of his owner, Jessica Healey of Wedmore in Somerset, who is selling her herd of beef calves, all named after Old Trafford stars, for slaughter. Bye bye David.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hats off to Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen, voted the three best players in the world in Fifa's recent poll. Well, at least they were by the Laos Under-20 coach Soutskhone Oudompet, the only one of 140 national-team coaches to vote exclusively for English players. There were other idiosyncratic choices: Bolivia's Manuel Reinaldo Bilches clearly hasn't seen Paulo Wanchope in action for a while. It also revealed the whereabouts of some forgotten characters. Willie McFaul, the former Newcastle United goalkeeper and manager, for example, is masterminding Guam's assault on the heights of world football. And Burma are the latest to grapple with the prose of the former Lincoln City manager Colin Murphy. If that doesn't make them clean up their human rights record, nothing will. \u0095 Quoting Murphy's programme notes is usually the last resort of the desperate football diarist, but the publication of a new history of Lincoln City makes it almost topical. Brian Halford's Past Imperfect takes Murphy's words as its guiding text: \"You, me, we all of us have been forced to breakfast on travesty, lunch on objection and insult, dine on inflicted pressure,\" the former City boss mused. Past Imperfect is a fine title, but Breakfasting On Travesty might have captured the essence of the Imps even better. \u0095Let's hope Soutskhone Oudompet wasn't watching Sky Digital's coverage of Manchester United v Arsenal on Monday night, which offered subscribers the chance to follow one player for 15 minutes at a time. One drawback became obvious when viewers watching Roy Keane found themselves lip-reading a mouthful of obscenities when Arsenal scored. Another, which would have disappointed Soutskhone, was that Andy Cole, picked as the next player in focus, was promptly substituted. Close-up footage of the pride of Laos donning his tracksuit: another coup for the digital revolution. \u0095The Cyprus FA is trawling the world for top-quality players qualified to represent the island. According to the French paper L'Equipe, the first two targets are Leicester City's Muzzy Izzet, whose Turkish background seems to make him a candidate, and the Watford teenager James Panayi. Look out world. \u0095The Diary's own performance-of-the-week award goes to Jack Lester, the Grimsby Town striker who has moved to Nottingham Forest. Lester took the trouble to post a message on a Grimsby internet mailing list, which read in part: \"I decided to send this message because I didn't just want to drift away without acknowledging the tremendous support I have had at Grimsby from the club, the management, the players, the other staff, the local press and radio, and of course the fans. Everyone has been an inspiration, in good times and bad.\" \u0095David Beckham is a huge animal, worth around \u00a3500. But don't take our word for it, that's the view of his owner, Jessica Healey of Wedmore in Somerset, who is selling her herd of beef calves, all named after Old Trafford stars, for slaughter. Bye bye David.",

Harris will not be allowed to officiate until February 29 at the earliest but the fourth official on duty at the tie, David Unsworth, despite having an allegation of technical irregularities proven against him, will face no further action.

Now I'm expected to follow, and it's a good thing my legs are strapped to a snowboard, otherwise they would be shaking uncontrollably. At least the view is good. </p> <p>And so it should be - I'm looking at the whole of Andorra, all 280 square miles of it. Immediately below is Arcalis, a resort that is eager to attract snowboarders to its miles of off-piste opportunities among these craggy peaks. Soon you won't need to fly to get to where I am; there will be a lift to give access to hundreds of gulleys and cliffs that seem tailor-made for boarding. </p> <p>But despite the board park, halfpipe, pisted runs and fast, modern chairlifts, there is a noticeable absence of crowds. As Mark Creighton, director of the ski school at Arcalis, explains, \"There is a policy to keep Arcalis green, so there are no hotels here, no accommodation, just the mountain. That keeps the number of people to an acceptable level and maintains the area's natural beauty.\" </p> <p>But back to the boarding, because that's what we're here for. I can't stay on top of the mountain for much longer, so I ease myself to the edge and lurch over. </p> <p>It's a bit like jumping from a high diving board and never quite landing and, although I flail my arms a lot and don't feel totally in control, neither am I quite out of control. Gaining confidence, I actually get in a few turns, sending the classic spray of snow out in a wide arc. Although, to my embarrassment, at the very moment I am stretched to the limit of my abilities, I notice Mark gently skiing backwards in front of me and looking at the scenery as if he's sliding on a nursery slope. </p> <p>Pretty soon we are back in the valley, just a handful of long, snaking tracks coming down off the peaks to show where we have been. </p> <p>We are based in the small town of Arinsal, which has a real village atmosphere and hostel-type accommodation, which should appeal to most snowboarders on the lookout for a no-frills trip. Arinsal itself is a good warm-up area with its wide, high-sided slopes, and it has the best nightlife in Andorra after Soldeu. </p> <p>The Surf restaurant, next to the gondola, offers one of the best barbecues around, while upstairs the club is open late and the drink is cheap and plentiful. However, being drunk in the street is actually illegal in Andorra, and, although there are no licensing hours, clubs are subject to noise limits, so that when you go to bed there is no music thumping through your head into the small hours and no screaming drunks outside your window. </p> <p>From Arinsal, it's no more than an hour's drive to any of the other resorts. But it's worth hiring a car because the ski bus service leaves a lot to be desired. </p> <p>The closest resort is Pal, a small place full of beautiful tree-lined runs, mainly reds, but with a few blues and greens. We had one of the best day's boarding here as well as the best food in the slope-side restaurant. </p> <p>Next came Soldeu-el-Tartar - a big mountain putting a lot of investment in on new lifts and a halfpipe.

      "body": "<p>1 <strong> Snowboarding looks easy, do I really need a lesson?</strong> If you take a full-day, professional lesson to start, you will avoid hours of frustration and struggle on the slopes. A full-day lesson will show you the basics of getting started, ease you into turns and polish your technique as you begin to link turns. A two-hour lesson leaves you hanging without skills to ride the mountain. </p> <p>2 <strong> Am I too old/young to get started?</strong> I have had 84-year-olds come through my snowboarding camp and seen many children learn to ride, although they had never been on skis before. Go for it at age seven. </p> <p>3 <strong> What is the best board for me?</strong> If you are interested in carving smooth turns with no jumping, then look into a freecarving board model with a length that falls between your nose and the top of your head. </p> <p>For all mountain riding and a solid performance in a wide variety of snow conditions, go for the freeriding board style. This is perfect for your first day on the slopes, the halfpipe or ripping up fresh powder. Buy a freeride model between your chin and nose in height. </p> <p>For fun, look at a freestyle board. They are light and easy turning makes them easy to spin and ride in all conditions, but they are not known for durability or ability to deliver stability at speeds. </p> <p> 4<strong> What is the best way to set up my bindings?</strong> <br> For a freestyle set-up, position your bindings slightly wider (centre to centre) than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. Place your front binding 10-27 degrees forward, or positive angle, and your back binding positive as well. Position your bindings so that your toes hang over the edge slightly more than your heels. Adjust the forward lean of your front binding, located on your highback, forward - to increase the response and quickness of your heelside edge. Rotate the highback of the front binding to become near parallel to the heelside edge. </p> <p>5 <strong> I have trouble stopping quickly, what's wrong?</strong> <br> If your legs are locked straight, your board will make a bounc ing, chattering attempt at stopping. The key to quick stops is being able to manage your board's pressure in the snow. Start with equal weight on both feet, when you will be pressuring the entire board into the snow. Now, you must apply your body weight through the board and on to the snow so that the edges grip. To do this, you must be able to lower your body mass on to the biting edge evenly and progressively. The legs will be flexing, allowing the weight of the body to pressure the edge and thus grip the snow and stop. </p> <p>6 <strong> I can make turns easy to my heels, but I fall when I try to get to my toes. Why?</strong> <br> Learning to make a heelside turn is easier because your body will rotate into the turn, if only to see where you are going. </p> <p>When it comes to making good toeside turns, first of all, slow down! On a heelside traverse, shift your weight (from 50/50) more to the front foot (70/30). Simply move your hips towards the nose of the board, which will then seek the fall line and begin the first half of the turn automatically. As you get going into the turn, rotate your head, shoulders, hips and knees into the same direction as the desired turn and stay on your front foot! Your board will come around effortlessly every time if you just remember the three simple steps: slow down, shift weight to front foot, rotate into the turn.</p> <p>Avoid leaning into the turn or getting on to your back foot because of fear. </p> <p>7 <strong> What should I work on to get better?</strong> <br> Learning to carve will help you ride longer with less effort and prepare you for riding powder. Aggressive short-radius turns are the only weapon against steep slopes, moguls, trees and crowds. </p> <p>Develop your carving balance by tipping your board up on edge past 45 degrees. Start riding down the fall line. Tip the board up on edge and try to maintain that edge, without sliding, across the slope and back up the hill. Practise on both edges. To link carve turns together, repeat the process to get started but roll the board over to the downhill edge when you get to 45 degrees away from the fall line. If you are sliding and you try to get on to the downhill edge, you will crash. Make sure you are carving before you go to the next turn. </p> <p>For aggressive edge-biting turns with an even tempo, try to find a rhythm in your head and keep the turn shape intact. The more you practise, the more you will gain strength and control over your board when the going gets rough. </p> <p>8 <strong> I can survive jumps, but how do I get good board grabs?</strong> <br> When you jump, you still need to maintain a good riding foundation, which includes: 50/50 weight, flexed knees and ankles, straight back, arms at your sides with one hand on either side of the board, and eyes looking in the direction of travel. Notice hand position. </p> <p>First the take off. Do not throw your hands into the air on every jump. Use your arms for balance only when you need them. On take-off, jump upward with your shoulders going skyward rather than your elbows. As you fly through the air, with the proper hand position, bring your board up under your body rather then reaching down for the rail. With decent hangtime, you will have your board in your hand with no effort, and - remembering to let go - land smoothly. </p> <p>9<strong> How do I learn to spin?</strong> <br> I suggest working on riding \"fakie\", or backwards, until you are comfortable turning and stopping. The obvious progression would be to start with a 180-degree rotation and move up 180 degrees at a time. That is why you want to learn to ride backwards first. </p> <p> 10 <strong> What is the secret to riding a halfpipe?</strong> <br> The secret to getting big air is not collapsing in the transition. You need to get set in the flat bottom in an aggressive stance with all the elements of a good foundation in place. As you enter the transition of the approaching wall, start to push gently with your legs to counter the force that is trying to get your legs to bend. If you bend at the legs in the transition, you will be slowing yourself down and losing speed required to launch out of the vertical. </p> <p>\u0095 Kevin Delaney presents more tips at Board-it.com, the online snowboarding guide.

This is perfect for your first day on the slopes, the halfpipe or ripping up fresh powder. Buy a freeride model between your chin and nose in height. For fun, look at a freestyle board. They are light and easy turning makes them easy to spin and ride in all conditions, but they are not known for durability or ability to deliver stability at speeds. 4 What is the best way to set up my bindings? For a freestyle set-up, position your bindings slightly wider (centre to centre) than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. Place your front binding 10-27 degrees forward, or positive angle, and your back binding positive as well. Position your bindings so that your toes hang over the edge slightly more than your heels. Adjust the forward lean of your front binding, located on your highback, forward - to increase the response and quickness of your heelside edge. Rotate the highback of the front binding to become near parallel to the heelside edge. 5 I have trouble stopping quickly, what's wrong? If your legs are locked straight, your board will make a bounc ing, chattering attempt at stopping. The key to quick stops is being able to manage your board's pressure in the snow. Start with equal weight on both feet, when you will be pressuring the entire board into the snow. Now, you must apply your body weight through the board and on to the snow so that the edges grip. To do this, you must be able to lower your body mass on to the biting edge evenly and progressively. The legs will be flexing, allowing the weight of the body to pressure the edge and thus grip the snow and stop. 6 I can make turns easy to my heels, but I fall when I try to get to my toes. Why? Learning to make a heelside turn is easier because your body will rotate into the turn, if only to see where you are going. When it comes to making good toeside turns, first of all, slow down! On a heelside traverse, shift your weight (from 50/50) more to the front foot (70/30). Simply move your hips towards the nose of the board, which will then seek the fall line and begin the first half of the turn automatically. As you get going into the turn, rotate your head, shoulders, hips and knees into the same direction as the desired turn and stay on your front foot! Your board will come around effortlessly every time if you just remember the three simple steps: slow down, shift weight to front foot, rotate into the turn. Avoid leaning into the turn or getting on to your back foot because of fear. 7 What should I work on to get better? Learning to carve will help you ride longer with less effort and prepare you for riding powder. Aggressive short-radius turns are the only weapon against steep slopes, moguls, trees and crowds. Develop your carving balance by tipping your board up on edge past 45 degrees. Start riding down the fall line. Tip the board up on edge and try to maintain that edge, without sliding, across the slope and back up the hill. Practise on both edges. To link carve turns together, repeat the process to get started but roll the board over to the downhill edge when you get to 45 degrees away from the fall line. If you are sliding and you try to get on to the downhill edge, you will crash. Make sure you are carving before you go to the next turn. For aggressive edge-biting turns with an even tempo, try to find a rhythm in your head and keep the turn shape intact. The more you practise, the more you will gain strength and control over your board when the going gets rough. 8 I can survive jumps, but how do I get good board grabs? When you jump, you still need to maintain a good riding foundation, which includes: 50/50 weight, flexed knees and ankles, straight back, arms at your sides with one hand on either side of the board, and eyes looking in the direction of travel. Notice hand position. First the take off. Do not throw your hands into the air on every jump. Use your arms for balance only when you need them. On take-off, jump upward with your shoulders going skyward rather than your elbows. As you fly through the air, with the proper hand position, bring your board up under your body rather then reaching down for the rail. With decent hangtime, you will have your board in your hand with no effort, and - remembering to let go - land smoothly. 9 How do I learn to spin? I suggest working on riding \"fakie\", or backwards, until you are comfortable turning and stopping. The obvious progression would be to start with a 180-degree rotation and move up 180 degrees at a time. That is why you want to learn to ride backwards first. 10 What is the secret to riding a halfpipe? The secret to getting big air is not collapsing in the transition. You need to get set in the flat bottom in an aggressive stance with all the elements of a good foundation in place. As you enter the transition of the approaching wall, start to push gently with your legs to counter the force that is trying to get your legs to bend. If you bend at the legs in the transition, you will be slowing yourself down and losing speed required to launch out of the vertical. \u0095 Kevin Delaney presents more tips at Board-it.com, the online snowboarding guide.

Once every decade, despite being a tiny Bavarian village 150 miles southwest of Munich. What's the significance of its play? In 1633, the village fell victim to the Black Death. The burghers took an oath that if it survived, they would re-enact Christ's suffering and death every 10 years. What good would that do? Hopefully, God would have pity on them and release their village from the epidemic. Did it work? No one died from the day of the vow, the village is still there, and the play has been performed every decade since. It sounds riveting. Cynics need not apply. There are barely enough tickets for true fans. A sell-out? A seat in the 4,600-strong audience calls for forward planning. Is it staged daily? Five times a week between May 22 and September 29, from 9am to 5.30pm, including a lunch break of three hours. Just line up at the box office? Contact with a tour operator to Germany would be a more sensible first step. The German Tourist Office (0171-317 0908) has a list of more than 40. Offering Passion packages?

I tried to find a diversionary sheep to point to. </p> <p>Next morning, we woke to the clanging of cow bells and by 10am we were swaying in a cable car up the side of Brienzer Rothorn, the 2,350m monster of a mountain that towers over the valley. At the top, I'd expected ice, wind and splendid isolation, and what we got were ice, wind, a caf\u00e9, restaurant and visitors' centre.

It began as one of those days that kids love and make parents twitch - more bobsleigh hell rides, two rounds of mini-golf and an hour spent floating in ever-decreasing circles on a pedalo at Brientz. Then the cloud began to lift and blobs of blue appeared in the sky. </p> <p>We jumped in the car and headed upwards, past Wengen and a waterfall so high that its water turns to mist, through passes that squirm through giant fissures in the rock, past rivers running white-water fast.

They flew over on day trips from France and bombed the hell out of the place. </p> <p>Canning Town still looks like a bomb site today. What can the aggregating droves of new Jubilee Line tourists make of this poor, if characterful, quarter of Thames-side London as they begin to turn up in search of local colour and refreshment? What tourists, you ask. Like I said, Jubilee Line Tourists. </p> <p>Since the long-awaited \u00a33.5bn Tube extension was completed just before the end of last year, a growing number of curious and intrepid tourists, Londoners among them, are buying One Day Zone 1-4 Travelcards (\u00a34.10) and trekking out east to explore the true wonders of JLE architecture. </p> <p>The pluckiest of all are daring to leave the palatial shelter of the stations to make forays into deepest Docklands. One can almost hear them echo Charlie Marlow, narrator of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, recalling, as his boat sails into the London docks, the last words of Mr Kurtz . . . \"The horror! The horror!\" </p> <p>I promise I'm not kidding. Although the Jubilee Line stations are as good as they're cracked up to be - true wonders of the public realm - first views from the generous concourses of Bermondsey, Canada Water, North Greenwich, Canning Town and West Ham are not exactly encouraging. </p> <p>The landscapes beyond are daunting, sweeping compositions of power lines, gas holders, Parcel Force depots, warehouses and every possible variety of local authority housing built between VJ Day in 1945 and the abolition of the GLC in 1986. Threaded and laced above, below, underneath and between are flyovers, flyunders, decidedly unmagical roundabouts, \"Drive Thru\" McDonalds and the extensive paraphernalia of London's sewage system. </p> <p>The grandest sight I saw within easy walking distance of West Ham station was the great Northern Outfall Sewer slewing eastwards from Mill Meads pumping station. Well, there was the extensive East London Cemetery, too, but, without doubt, nothing here matches the imposing JLE station. An impressive architectural essay in brick, concrete and glass, this is dominated by an imposing Dudok Dutch-style clock tower and is, touchingly, a homage to Charles Holden (1875-1960), the Quaker Arts &amp; Crafts architect who refused a knighthood (twice) and bequeathed London some of its finest Underground stations, pre-JLE. </p> <p>It really is worth making the brief trip to West Ham to see the new station designed by Haward &amp; Van Heyningen. I am prepared to admit that you might find few other places of interest in West Ham (don't jump to conclusions: the famous football club's ground is reached from Upton Park station, which is some way off), so let's go back and begin at the beginning, at Westminster where the 11 new stations of the JLE begin. </p> <p>There's no point listing the tourist sights above Michael Hopkins' superb new station, although I found it strange (imagining myself a tourist in my own city) that there appears to be just one, rather pricey, caf\u00e9 anywhere near Parliament Square. There is a very highly subsidised caf\u00e9 and restaurant opening on to a magnificent Gothic Revival riverside terrace nearby, but this is reserved for those who toil not, but spin (the latter a great deal) and pretend to represent the rest of us in the Mother of Parliaments. </p> <p>The station is like a Piranesi etching brought to life, but through the distorting lens of 20th-century engineering. The set designers of BBC TV's Gormenghast have nothing on this modern castelline architecture. Its toughness, its sheer battleship qualities help to redeem the tarty and grossly overweight Portcullis House that groans above the Underground station and, curiously, has been designed by the same architect. </p> <p>On to Waterloo, where you can watch the beginnings of restoration work on Nicholas Grimshaw's Eurostar Terminal. Tourists often overlook the gastronomic wonders of The Cut (sinful cakes at Konditor &amp; Cook, tapas to write home to Spain about at Don Felippe and great fish at Livebait), the fetishistic wonders of Lower Marsh (Ian Allan for railway books and model trains; Honour for rubberwear and size 12 six-inch stilettos) in favour of the improving culture of the South Bank. </p> <p>At the east end of The Cut is Southwark station, a magical design by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, its lofty concourse dominated by an imposing wall of blue glass installed by the artist Alex Beleschenko. Outside: the unrewarding rigours of Blackfriars Road and, from May, a reasonably brief walk to the brand new Tate Modern housed in the former Bankside Power Station which looms over the Globe Theatre. </p> <p>London Bridge is next. Far from falling down, as once it looked to be, the station - underground at least - is a deeply impressive and clearly signed labyrinth, no string required to find your way out. Designed by young JLE architects under Roland Paoletti. Excellent. Outside . . . the bridge, of course, and Tower Bridge a few minutes' walk east, the delightfully spooky London Dungeon, pisco sours at Fina Estampa, one of London's finest (only?) Peruvian restaurants, and the Dickensian walk underneath the arches down Bermondsey Street to Tower Bridge Road. </p> <p>And so out to Docklands proper. Talk about Dickensian, me old china. Slap, bang, wallop across the frog from the old (ie brand new) Tube station is the Dickens Estate. You could've knocked me down wiv a fevvah. A butcher's down one end of Jamaica Road reveals the dreaded Canary Wharf Tower; a butcher's the other way has its polar opposite to show, a high-rise council tower of the late 1960s. </p> <p>In fact, Bermondsey is a kind of exhibition of LCC and GLC post-Blitz housing. I find this riveting; you might find it depressing. If so, everyone back on the train. </p> <p> Canada Water. Housed under a huge glazed drum - it would be ideal for high-wire trapeze shows - the concourse of this station is deeply impressive. But, it's set in the middle of what looks to be nowhere and, unless you're a fan of 40-ton articulated lorries, I'd stick to the station boundaries, then press on to Canary Wharf. </p> <p>This is the JLE's showcase, the second busiest Under ground station after Oxford Circus and designed by Foster &amp; Partners on an awe-inspiring scale. Here's the heroic civic engineering of ancient Rome brought brilliantly up-to-date. Superb. </p> <p>Upstairs is, well, Canary Wharf, an alarmingly funny Yuppie theme park. Its Logan's Run atmosphere (you're dead meat here if you're over 30) is unsettling - no grannies, no dogs, no working class (sorry, I nearly forgot: they don't exist anymore in New Britain), yet the bombastic Chicago and Manhattan-style architecture is well worth seeing. Lots of public art, some of it excellent. </p> <p>Bring barrowloads of cash or gold credit cards. There are no bargains at the Wharf. Hotel by Philippe Starck opens this year; the bar could well be fun. The Brera caf\u00e9 in the shopping mall serves some of the only decent capuccinos in London beyond Soho's Bar Italia. </p> <p>A few stragglers left their seats at North Greenwich station, jaws set, determined, despite the freezing mist, to have the best day of their lives, as advertised by the Prime Minister. The Yves Klein blue station is fantastic and the bus station above is pretty good, too. </p> <p>Canning Town's next. That's where I came in. The station is, again, a fine piece of architecture; it sits, like some latter-day religious monument on top of a rise. The bus station, by Eva Jiricna, alongside it combines to form an almost Baroque composition. Not Turin or Dresden, maybe, but pretty impressive all the same. </p> <p>The station is partly on the sight of the one-time Thames Ironworks. The last ship built here was HMS Thunderer in 1911. Not much seems to have happened since. Your choice is fish'n'chips, Caribbean takeaway or proper bacon sarnies on crusty slices of white bloomer in the market caf\u00e9. </p> <p>Aw'right. Back on the Tube to West Ham and into the supremely airy Stratford station that cries out for a smart stainless-steel topped Italian bar and caf\u00e9. Change here for Southend and Clacton, but these cockney resorts are well out of London Underground bounds. Back to Westminster, its one caf\u00e9 and the crowded, Tube-driven London every tourist knows.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> The Day Britain Died</strong><br>Andrew Marr <br>Profile, \u00a37.99, 251pp</p> <p>Successful political journalists, in the end, can rarely resist issuing a state-of-the-nation proclamation. Perhaps it's all their professional exposure to policy and rhetoric, those overheated Westminster afternoons among the power-wielders and fantasists. Perhaps it's the election campaigns, the sweeps through distant marginals, the growing sense, watching Britain roll past beyond the tinted glass of the press bus, that the truths of these islands are most plainly revealed to travelling lobby correspondents. </p> <p>Either way, this book, at first, feels deadeningly over-familiar. Andrew Marr, who has written political columns for many newspapers, and has appeared on many current affairs programmes, has produced \"at speed\" a volume heavily reliant on quotes from his fellow pundits and polemicists.</p> <p>Here are half-page sections and hurried references from Jeremy Paxman's The English, Peter Hitchens's The Abolition Of Britain, Simon Heffer's Nor Shall My Sword: The Reinvention of England - all recent books, all concerned with the temperature of the nation in the early fevers of devolution, and all slightly patched-together, short on original fact and thought.</p> <p>Ten days ago, on Newsnight on BBC2, Paxman interviewed Marr about the reform of the House of Lords, a subject mentioned in both their books. The impression was left of busy, clever men, slightly distracted and over-committed, their multimedia careers perhaps stunting individual projects. This Monday, Marr is scheduled to appear on BBC2 again, presenting this book's television version. </p> <p>The thesis he is so efficiently publicising is that Britain is at a \"turning-point\". The union of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which conservatives often call ancient but is in fact less than three centuries old, is most likely doomed. Devolution and its consequences, and the deepening tensions between English regions, and the tightenings of European integration and American influence and worldwide capitalism, are all straining the old shotgun marriage beyond repair. If it is not to dissolve into nastiness, Marr argues, then a new, more flexible set of arrangements needs to be found. He and his camera crew have gone looking for them. </p> <p>For the opening 70 pages, Marr's prose putters agreeably along, up and down the lanes of British history and constitutional theory, nipping up side roads to discuss the dominance of London, the impact of electronic commerce or the future of the BBC, and stopping briefly at the obvious sights - Diana's funeral crowds, the former Govan shipyards - for the modern amateur sociologist. Unlike, say, Heffer or Hitchens, he is never pompous, his underlying arguments sound logical, and he writes fluent, conversational paragraphs; but he does not surprise. It is rather like reading expertly presented revision notes. </p> <p>As Marr talks to Scots about the inevitability of independence, spies \"storm-clouds ahead for the Windsors\", and warns of the \"slow extinction\" of the Commons by public apathy and New Labour's majority, a picture of abrupt and imminent change quite at odds with his measured language comes into focus.</p> <p>It's what you might call the Charter 88 problem: British liberals have been anticipating the break-up of the established order for so long, and so politely, with countless mild petitions and sensibly researched schemes copied from abroad, that the whole process has come to seem inevitable - consensual, close to boring. In fact, as any fearful glance at the Daily Telegraph will tell you, a good proportion of Britons are hot-faced with outrage at the weakening of the old order. Others are furiously impatient to hasten it. Once Marr starts meeting these people, his pages start to reward more than skim-reading. </p> <p>There is a towering English nationalist from Buckinghamshire called Cyning Meadowcroft, who looms outside Parliament every Wednesday, and five years ago persuaded an American company to start producing cards for St George's Day (sales have swelled from almost zero beforehand to over 50,000). There is Robin Page, ex-presenter of One Man and His Dog and the rural Right's favourite martyr, railing against Tuscany and bistros and \"Blair and his wife prancing about like little emperors [when] you've got farmers who can't get tuppence\". There is a trucker from Basildon called Derick who keeps saying other Europeans are \"just the same as us\", although he can't speak their languages. </p> <p>Marr listens, then challenges. He contrasts the rhetoric of country conservatives - all their teary talk of a threatened grassy idyll - with the actual history of much of the British countryside: \"enclosures... waves of agricultural and industrial revolution... hellish working conditions and bad housing\". He confronts Eurosceptics with the complicity of the British political institutions they idealise in the quiet advance of Brussels. In fact, every time someone says anything lazy, Marr politely demolishes it, like a modest student winning a pub argument. </p> <p>The Britain that emerges is mixed-up, complicated, and \"in a state of constant flux\". The supposedly cruel capital, for example, absorbs immigrants more easily than allegedly friendlier regions. The English patriots of the Home Counties know more about Normandy than the north of England. The idea of Englishness itself, Marr suggests, may never, at any time, have meant the same thing to everyone. His writing relishes these tensions and contradictions: English tabloid culture is neatly summarised as \"swagger and self-pity\"; the \"strange, sharp flavour\" of modern Britain is crisply evoked. </p> <p>Marr concludes that only a federal country, with separate parliaments for each of its parts, can hope to hold such a hybrid together. He fears a complete break-up, interestingly, for the squeeze it might put on minorities. Smaller countries may want more standard sorts of citizen; to judge by the homophobia currently popular among some of Scotland's cultural guardians, Marr could be right. And by the finish here, as his sentences lengthen and implore, and repeat earlier motifs, and stretch towards a mild sort of oratory, it is possible to imagine his television series ending quite grandly.</p>",

Here are half-page sections and hurried references from Jeremy Paxman's The English, Peter Hitchens's The Abolition Of Britain, Simon Heffer's Nor Shall My Sword: The Reinvention of England - all recent books, all concerned with the temperature of the nation in the early fevers of devolution, and all slightly patched-together, short on original fact and thought. Ten days ago, on Newsnight on BBC2, Paxman interviewed Marr about the reform of the House of Lords, a subject mentioned in both their books. The impression was left of busy, clever men, slightly distracted and over-committed, their multimedia careers perhaps stunting individual projects. This Monday, Marr is scheduled to appear on BBC2 again, presenting this book's television version. The thesis he is so efficiently publicising is that Britain is at a \"turning-point\". The union of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which conservatives often call ancient but is in fact less than three centuries old, is most likely doomed. Devolution and its consequences, and the deepening tensions between English regions, and the tightenings of European integration and American influence and worldwide capitalism, are all straining the old shotgun marriage beyond repair. If it is not to dissolve into nastiness, Marr argues, then a new, more flexible set of arrangements needs to be found. He and his camera crew have gone looking for them. For the opening 70 pages, Marr's prose putters agreeably along, up and down the lanes of British history and constitutional theory, nipping up side roads to discuss the dominance of London, the impact of electronic commerce or the future of the BBC, and stopping briefly at the obvious sights - Diana's funeral crowds, the former Govan shipyards - for the modern amateur sociologist. Unlike, say, Heffer or Hitchens, he is never pompous, his underlying arguments sound logical, and he writes fluent, conversational paragraphs; but he does not surprise. It is rather like reading expertly presented revision notes. As Marr talks to Scots about the inevitability of independence, spies \"storm-clouds ahead for the Windsors\", and warns of the \"slow extinction\" of the Commons by public apathy and New Labour's majority, a picture of abrupt and imminent change quite at odds with his measured language comes into focus. It's what you might call the Charter 88 problem: British liberals have been anticipating the break-up of the established order for so long, and so politely, with countless mild petitions and sensibly researched schemes copied from abroad, that the whole process has come to seem inevitable - consensual, close to boring. In fact, as any fearful glance at the Daily Telegraph will tell you, a good proportion of Britons are hot-faced with outrage at the weakening of the old order. Others are furiously impatient to hasten it. Once Marr starts meeting these people, his pages start to reward more than skim-reading. There is a towering English nationalist from Buckinghamshire called Cyning Meadowcroft, who looms outside Parliament every Wednesday, and five years ago persuaded an American company to start producing cards for St George's Day (sales have swelled from almost zero beforehand to over 50,000). There is Robin Page, ex-presenter of One Man and His Dog and the rural Right's favourite martyr, railing against Tuscany and bistros and \"Blair and his wife prancing about like little emperors [when] you've got farmers who can't get tuppence\". There is a trucker from Basildon called Derick who keeps saying other Europeans are \"just the same as us\", although he can't speak their languages. Marr listens, then challenges. He contrasts the rhetoric of country conservatives - all their teary talk of a threatened grassy idyll - with the actual history of much of the British countryside: \"enclosures... waves of agricultural and industrial revolution... hellish working conditions and bad housing\". He confronts Eurosceptics with the complicity of the British political institutions they idealise in the quiet advance of Brussels. In fact, every time someone says anything lazy, Marr politely demolishes it, like a modest student winning a pub argument. The Britain that emerges is mixed-up, complicated, and \"in a state of constant flux\". The supposedly cruel capital, for example, absorbs immigrants more easily than allegedly friendlier regions. The English patriots of the Home Counties know more about Normandy than the north of England. The idea of Englishness itself, Marr suggests, may never, at any time, have meant the same thing to everyone. His writing relishes these tensions and contradictions: English tabloid culture is neatly summarised as \"swagger and self-pity\"; the \"strange, sharp flavour\" of modern Britain is crisply evoked. Marr concludes that only a federal country, with separate parliaments for each of its parts, can hope to hold such a hybrid together. He fears a complete break-up, interestingly, for the squeeze it might put on minorities. Smaller countries may want more standard sorts of citizen; to judge by the homophobia currently popular among some of Scotland's cultural guardians, Marr could be right. And by the finish here, as his sentences lengthen and implore, and repeat earlier motifs, and stretch towards a mild sort of oratory, it is possible to imagine his television series ending quite grandly.",

      "body": "<p>The single most important thing not to be in Bologna is on a diet. Breakfast may be optional, but all other meals are compulsive, eating between meals is compelling, and lunch is compulsory. Shortly before 1pm, the shop shutters come down and Bologna tucks in. </p> <p>They're at it well before that, though. </p> <p>Yes, you can do the sensible thing and check what's on at the town hall's tourist office on Piazza Maggiore - \"a mighty square\", as Henry James wrote after his own three-day city break here in 1869, \"with the Middle Ages &amp; the Renaissance all frowning &amp; smiling together\". But Bologna may rearrange your good intentions and, before the weekend is out, you could find yourself turning into Michael Winner. </p> <p>Bologna's \"historic centre\" is made for the short break - a walkably compact constellation of palaces, student bars, galleries, restaurants, shops, piazzas and churches in pinks, terracottas and ochres, connected by a 25-mile cardiovascular system of bustling porticoed walkways. </p> <p>And you can enjoy it in the company of locals instead of the tourist legions of Florence or Venice, though that could change now that Italy's foodie capital is a Europe 2000 City of Culture. </p> <p>The tarpaulins are coming down to reveal \u00a360m worth of new projects and restoration works, including a Museum of Music in the ornate Sanguinetti Palace and the complete renovation of the old tobacco and salt warehouses to house the Cineteca film archive. The list - take a look on <a href=\"http://www.bologna2000.it\">www.bologna2000.it</a> - runs to 600 projects. </p> <p>So here it is, 10.30am of a bright, wintry Saturday morning, and I have climbed 500-plus steps for terrific views of the Apennine foothills from Bologna's tilting landmark - the 12th-century Asinelli tower. Then I am seduced by Blowoutsville. </p> <p>Noticing a lot of people already in smart bars knocking back the bubbly, I join in. Soon after, a minor feast at a lowly market snack stall testifies that even the junk-food here is great. </p> <p>Then, walking the network of stylish streets around the main square, I see an outdoor cocktail party. It's the over flow from the bar-pasticceria Zanarini. Inside, amid cakes and pyramids of pink meringues, a long stainless-steel crescent of a bar is covered with canap\u00e9s. </p> <p>I must get a grip before eats and drinks subvert all my resolutions, which include: see art, see buildings, see shops, get to at least one recital and buzz round the city on that modern-day Etruscan transport, the scooter. </p> <p>My other ambition is to find out if this inventive city sent the rest of us the watery mince but kept the real spaghetti bolognese patent locked in its own kitchens and laughed its head off. </p> <p>There are two things that everyone in Bologna will tell you - that Europe's first university was founded here in the 11th century, and that it invented pasta. </p> <p>I visit the university, with its wonderful grand hall and courtyard walls covered with the heraldic crests of long-ago students. I also find plenty of pasta - tortellini, tortelloni, ravioli, twirly gramigna, tagliatelle, pappardelle and lasagne. But nobody boasts about you-know-what. </p> <p>At the edge of Piazza Maggiore, I find what to me is the most gripping monument of the visit: broad panels of small black-and-white photographs engraved on tiles. They are the faces of Bologna's many war-time partisans. Some were executed in this square. This is the counterpoint to the present-day abundance, the upmarket shops, the new rightwing mayor and the many ladies who brush by in all shades of mink. </p> <p>But, as I find throughout Bologna, stylish does not mean stand-offish. At the Baglioni, a grand hotel in the old style, I am inundated with charm, from managers, to desk staff. At supper at Battibecco, one of Bologna's top restaurants, owner Nico Costa bounds out of the kitchen to shake hands and resolve my confusion about you-know-what. </p> <p>\"Italians never ask for spaghetti bolognese!\" he declares. He dismisses the idea that you should help it along with a bit of ground pork or prosciutto - \"It's beef, only beef, with celery, carrots, onions, tomatoes cooked for a long time.\" </p> <p>And he insists that the one thing you never put in spaghetti bolognese is spaghetti. It's tagliatelli; that's official. </p> <p>After the meal, I understand why Bologna's nickname is La Grassa (The Fat), and why Italy's top medical school is situated here: I am ready to be carried straight from the table to the cardiac ward. </p> <p>But Bologna is a late-night city buzzing with 60,000 university students, and I am temporarily revived by the throbbing bars on side-streets off the Via Zamboni. </p> <p>The knock-out blow is a large ice cream, after which I remember nothing. I will never know how Mr Winner does it. </p> <p>I awake to stillness and open the window on dense swirls of snow. Overnight, a thick white duvet has fallen over the city. Outside, people are bringing children and puppies for a look. There are palm trees weighed down with snow in palazzo gardens. </p> <p>Hiring a scooter is out, but the porticoes make walking easy, so I spend Sunday morning on church crawl with caf\u00e9 stops for hot chocolate as syrupy and black as crude oil. </p> <p>Cavernous San Petronio basilica is gloomy, but San Giacomo on Piazza Rossini is warm with candlelight and a good soloist; Santa Maria dei Servi has a wonderful organ. </p> <p>Later that day, I get to hear a Renaissance choral recital. Some members of the audience are puppies. I also call in at Bologna's national gallery, the Pinacoteca, to see its Carraccis and Renis. </p> <p>Next morning, as I pack, it all begins to melt. Big armfuls of snow crashing down from the trees, roadways a soupy slush. I am off home. No more Renaissance musical puppies, no more streets of furry ladies. I am no longer Michael Winner. It is all running away in the melt-off, like a dream. </p> <p><strong>5 of the best places to eat</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Zanarini</strong>, Piazza Galvani, for champagne and canapes.</p> <p><strong>2. A F Tamburini</strong>, Via Caprarie 1, a classic delicatessen with a self service buffet.</p> <p> <strong>3. Lazzarini</strong>, Via Clavature 1, a big functional but stylish fast-food place.</p> <p><strong>4. Il Portico</strong>, Via Augusta Righi 11, for pizza.</p> <p><strong>5. Trattoria Anna Maria</strong>, Via delle Belle Arti, for pasta.</p> <p><strong>If you've got any energy left over...</strong></p> <p><strong>1. </strong> Take a city walking tour from the tourist office in the town hall (Palazzo Comunale). </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Hire a scooter from Treno e Scooter on the railway forecourt, 0039 051 253 832.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Bar crawl in university area around Via Zamboni. Don't miss Le Stanze at Via del Borgo di San Pietro 1.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Sprint up the 97m Asinelli tower.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Stockpile regional foodstuffs to take home. Mushrooms ir truffles on Via Drapperie, or fresh pasta at Paolo Atti, Via Caprarie 7.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Advance hotel booking is a good idea: Bologna hosts lots of arts festivals and trade fairs.

      "bodyText": "The single most important thing not to be in Bologna is on a diet. Breakfast may be optional, but all other meals are compulsive, eating between meals is compelling, and lunch is compulsory. Shortly before 1pm, the shop shutters come down and Bologna tucks in. They're at it well before that, though. Yes, you can do the sensible thing and check what's on at the town hall's tourist office on Piazza Maggiore - \"a mighty square\", as Henry James wrote after his own three-day city break here in 1869, \"with the Middle Ages &amp; the Renaissance all frowning &amp; smiling together\". But Bologna may rearrange your good intentions and, before the weekend is out, you could find yourself turning into Michael Winner. Bologna's \"historic centre\" is made for the short break - a walkably compact constellation of palaces, student bars, galleries, restaurants, shops, piazzas and churches in pinks, terracottas and ochres, connected by a 25-mile cardiovascular system of bustling porticoed walkways. And you can enjoy it in the company of locals instead of the tourist legions of Florence or Venice, though that could change now that Italy's foodie capital is a Europe 2000 City of Culture. The tarpaulins are coming down to reveal \u00a360m worth of new projects and restoration works, including a Museum of Music in the ornate Sanguinetti Palace and the complete renovation of the old tobacco and salt warehouses to house the Cineteca film archive. The list - take a look on www.bologna2000.it - runs to 600 projects. So here it is, 10.30am of a bright, wintry Saturday morning, and I have climbed 500-plus steps for terrific views of the Apennine foothills from Bologna's tilting landmark - the 12th-century Asinelli tower. Then I am seduced by Blowoutsville. Noticing a lot of people already in smart bars knocking back the bubbly, I join in. Soon after, a minor feast at a lowly market snack stall testifies that even the junk-food here is great. Then, walking the network of stylish streets around the main square, I see an outdoor cocktail party. It's the over flow from the bar-pasticceria Zanarini. Inside, amid cakes and pyramids of pink meringues, a long stainless-steel crescent of a bar is covered with canap\u00e9s. I must get a grip before eats and drinks subvert all my resolutions, which include: see art, see buildings, see shops, get to at least one recital and buzz round the city on that modern-day Etruscan transport, the scooter. My other ambition is to find out if this inventive city sent the rest of us the watery mince but kept the real spaghetti bolognese patent locked in its own kitchens and laughed its head off. There are two things that everyone in Bologna will tell you - that Europe's first university was founded here in the 11th century, and that it invented pasta. I visit the university, with its wonderful grand hall and courtyard walls covered with the heraldic crests of long-ago students. I also find plenty of pasta - tortellini, tortelloni, ravioli, twirly gramigna, tagliatelle, pappardelle and lasagne. But nobody boasts about you-know-what. At the edge of Piazza Maggiore, I find what to me is the most gripping monument of the visit: broad panels of small black-and-white photographs engraved on tiles. They are the faces of Bologna's many war-time partisans. Some were executed in this square. This is the counterpoint to the present-day abundance, the upmarket shops, the new rightwing mayor and the many ladies who brush by in all shades of mink. But, as I find throughout Bologna, stylish does not mean stand-offish. At the Baglioni, a grand hotel in the old style, I am inundated with charm, from managers, to desk staff. At supper at Battibecco, one of Bologna's top restaurants, owner Nico Costa bounds out of the kitchen to shake hands and resolve my confusion about you-know-what. \"Italians never ask for spaghetti bolognese!\" he declares. He dismisses the idea that you should help it along with a bit of ground pork or prosciutto - \"It's beef, only beef, with celery, carrots, onions, tomatoes cooked for a long time.\" And he insists that the one thing you never put in spaghetti bolognese is spaghetti. It's tagliatelli; that's official. After the meal, I understand why Bologna's nickname is La Grassa (The Fat), and why Italy's top medical school is situated here: I am ready to be carried straight from the table to the cardiac ward. But Bologna is a late-night city buzzing with 60,000 university students, and I am temporarily revived by the throbbing bars on side-streets off the Via Zamboni. The knock-out blow is a large ice cream, after which I remember nothing. I will never know how Mr Winner does it. I awake to stillness and open the window on dense swirls of snow. Overnight, a thick white duvet has fallen over the city. Outside, people are bringing children and puppies for a look. There are palm trees weighed down with snow in palazzo gardens. Hiring a scooter is out, but the porticoes make walking easy, so I spend Sunday morning on church crawl with caf\u00e9 stops for hot chocolate as syrupy and black as crude oil. Cavernous San Petronio basilica is gloomy, but San Giacomo on Piazza Rossini is warm with candlelight and a good soloist; Santa Maria dei Servi has a wonderful organ. Later that day, I get to hear a Renaissance choral recital. Some members of the audience are puppies. I also call in at Bologna's national gallery, the Pinacoteca, to see its Carraccis and Renis. Next morning, as I pack, it all begins to melt. Big armfuls of snow crashing down from the trees, roadways a soupy slush. I am off home. No more Renaissance musical puppies, no more streets of furry ladies. I am no longer Michael Winner. It is all running away in the melt-off, like a dream. 5 of the best places to eat 1. Zanarini, Piazza Galvani, for champagne and canapes. 2. A F Tamburini, Via Caprarie 1, a classic delicatessen with a self service buffet. 3. Lazzarini, Via Clavature 1, a big functional but stylish fast-food place. 4. Il Portico, Via Augusta Righi 11, for pizza. 5. Trattoria Anna Maria, Via delle Belle Arti, for pasta. If you've got any energy left over... 1. Take a city walking tour from the tourist office in the town hall (Palazzo Comunale). 2. Hire a scooter from Treno e Scooter on the railway forecourt, 0039 051 253 832. 3. Bar crawl in university area around Via Zamboni. Don't miss Le Stanze at Via del Borgo di San Pietro 1. 4. Sprint up the 97m Asinelli tower. 5. Stockpile regional foodstuffs to take home. Mushrooms ir truffles on Via Drapperie, or fresh pasta at Paolo Atti, Via Caprarie 7. The practicals Advance hotel booking is a good idea: Bologna hosts lots of arts festivals and trade fairs.

At my hotel in coastal Sabratha, the bathroom floor was permanently flooded, but the window framed a triple-decker Roman theatre, a stupendous panel of pink pillared stone propping up the evening sky.

I hitched a ride for a few days in a 14-ton expeditionary truck run by the UK adventure holiday operator Dragoman, and we roared for hours through a parched landscape with all the ease of a Sunday morning cruise on the M6. The highway ran straight and empty to the hot horizon, like the finger-tracing on a frozen pool which exposes the charcoal ice below. </p> <p>Here and there, the finger strayed from the straight line, and the truck was forced to work cautiously round the edge of a dune that had lunged across our track. Periodically, we passed bus carcases on their side and buckled cars hard up against gulch walls, the sand lapping over the steering wheels. </p> <p>Three camels, with skins like frothing coffee, stalked stiffly by, one with a giant \"X\" branded into its right hind leg. We overtook a van heaped high with green foliage lopped from goodness knows where. As the sun rolled west, tiny shrubs scratched through the darkening dustbowl, looking like grouse on a Scottish moor. </p> <p>The truck, named Carmen Electra, lurched off-road and we pitched our tents in a saucer of red dust and strange pale-green berries the size of ping-pong balls. Overhead, the night sky glistened like a jewelled aubergine. Leaning against Carmen's spare wheel to steady our binoculars, we could make out one of the moons of Jupiter. </p> <p>Next morning, we continued north through the crusted plateau. Pliny talked of the region's \"wilderness of elephants\", but we saw only camels and a scrawny rabbit. After Carmen had wound down the ragged edge of the escarpment, random gravel pits and car dumps signalled the approach of civilisation. At dusty Azizyah, 30 miles from Tripoli, there were the first commercial clumps of olive trees, brought to North Africa by the Phoenicians and then mass-cultivated by the Romans, who planted 15 million of them. Near the barracks where the US airforce bombed Gadafy's quarters in 1986, a sheep stood on its hind legs and munched olive leaves, like an old man chewing tobacco. The Dragoman caravan halted for 48 hours in Tripoli, a comfortable and atmospheric city where fig trees and Italianate balconies distribute calm and shade over gouged-up pavements. In the market of the old city, dates were smeared like honey into straw urns, and lamb joints hung festooned with green ribbons of coriander and parsley. Dark Tuareg faces wrapped in cotton shashes, strode past air-conditioned offices. The regime has relaxed the rules on private enterprise: I bought a tape of Libyan reggae music for \u00a31 and a huge sugared doughnut from a street vendor for 8p. </p> <p>A stone's throw from the old city, the Byzantine citadel of Assaray-al-Hamra has been converted into Libya's national museum.

This too is a story of a bunch of eccentrics rebelling in their country's capital. </p> <p>Uzupis, or the Republic of Angels as it has been dubbed, comprises only 148 acres and around 120 residents. It has one main street, surrounded by lanes and courtyards full of art galleries. But since last April it has had its own president, its own bishop, two churches, an embassy in Moscow and no fewer than four official flags - one for each season. Banners hang from neglected buildings, labelling them the Uzupis Sheraton, Chanel and Harods (sic). </p> <p>Soon the tiny state will have its own Nelson's column or Eiffel tower - a bronze sculpture of an angel that will stand in the main square, in honour of Zeonas Steinys, a much-loved local painter who died in 1998. Its unveiling will mark the official founding of the Republic of Angels - and if that causes problems with the rest of Lithuania, there is a 12-strong army to call on. </p> <p>In Pimlico the rebellion began with the detonation of an unexploded bomb left over from the second world war. In Uzupis the trigger was Frank Zappa, the gifted but undeniably weird American rock star. </p> <p>Nine years ago Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union, leaving a lot of empty plinths that had previously been occupied by statues of Lenin, Marx and their regional disciples.

      "bodyText": "There aren't many Lithuanians who have seen Passport to Pimlico, the classic Ealing comedy in which a group of Londoners declare independence from Britain after uncovering documents that reveal their home streets to be part of Burgundy. That's a shame, because it might help the bemused residents of Vilnius understand what's going on in the ancient district of Uzupis. This too is a story of a bunch of eccentrics rebelling in their country's capital. Uzupis, or the Republic of Angels as it has been dubbed, comprises only 148 acres and around 120 residents. It has one main street, surrounded by lanes and courtyards full of art galleries. But since last April it has had its own president, its own bishop, two churches, an embassy in Moscow and no fewer than four official flags - one for each season. Banners hang from neglected buildings, labelling them the Uzupis Sheraton, Chanel and Harods (sic). Soon the tiny state will have its own Nelson's column or Eiffel tower - a bronze sculpture of an angel that will stand in the main square, in honour of Zeonas Steinys, a much-loved local painter who died in 1998. Its unveiling will mark the official founding of the Republic of Angels - and if that causes problems with the rest of Lithuania, there is a 12-strong army to call on. In Pimlico the rebellion began with the detonation of an unexploded bomb left over from the second world war. In Uzupis the trigger was Frank Zappa, the gifted but undeniably weird American rock star. Nine years ago Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union, leaving a lot of empty plinths that had previously been occupied by statues of Lenin, Marx and their regional disciples. An obvious question remained: what to do with the empty plinths? Saulius Paukstys, a civil servant and member of the Vilnius bohemian set, saw the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition. He founded the Frank Zappa Fan Club and commissioned a socialist realist sculptor to create a statue of Zappa on a patch of land in front of a children's hospital in the centre of the city. \"We were desperate to find a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom,\" Paukstys recalls. He now holds the post of national security chief. At first the authorities criticised the plan, particularly after discovering that Zappa was a bit of a leftie. \"They said: 'What has he got to do with Lithuania anyway?' We said: 'Nothing really.' Then someone convinced them that Zappa had Jewish features and seeing as Jewish history is very important to Lithuania, they plumped for that.\" The statue was erected in downtown Vilnius five years ago. The most famous of modern Bohemians, Czech president Vaclav Havel, was invited to the unveiling, where a military brass band played Zappa hits. Membership of the fan club ballooned; a radio station allocated airtime for a weekly Zappa broadcast, which included doses of Zappa philosophy; and a Zappa Love Letter Club was set up to bring Vilnius's lonely hearts together. The fan club and the city's artistic community are practically synonymous, so when the artists started drifting back to their old haunt of Uzupis, Zappa was the natural candidate for patron saint. And last spring, when the local artists and young people decided to take a stand against the city council's neglect of Uzupis, he was the figure they rallied behind. \"The spirit of Zappa made us see that independence from Moscow was not enough and persuaded us to declare independence from the rest of Vilnius,\" says Paukstys. \"We're trying to relearn the smell of identity,\" agrees Roman Lileikis, president of Uzupis and one of Lithuania's leading musicians and film-makers.

      "body": "<p>The journey began in November, the month the Lakota Sioux call the Moon When the Wolves Run Together, in my home city of Glasgow. It was to take me across the ocean and half a continent away to South Dakota on the trail of the American Indian. </p> <p>In 1892, Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show came to Glasgow and created a sensation, as it did throughout Europe. The people of my city were wild for it, especially for the Indians and their fantastic costumes. A member of the troupe gave a Lakota Sioux ghost dance shirt to Kelvingrove art gallery and museum. I remember seeing it there as a child, along with a model of an Indian Plains family, all dressed in buckskin and beading. But in 1999 Glasgow recognised the shirt as an important piece of Sioux history and returned it to the tribe. </p> <p>As the plane flies into Minneapolis, the city lights spread out below us, I am struck with the thought of the strangeness of cities. The great plains where the Indians roamed in search of buffalo are now a great forest of pale orange and yellow, miles and miles of artificial lights laid out on the land like millions of barren Christmas trees. Instead of a people at one with nature, we have become aliens on the earth, people who can't see the stars in the sky for the orange haze above our streets. </p> <p>On to Rapid City and then the long drive across the prairie. The roads are so endless and so empty that you wonder how the Indians and the whites ever ran into each other. I stop at Wall, a little town on the edge of the South Dakota Badlands. It's a curious experience, one of those delights that Western capitalism throws up, a place that flourishes because a demand has been created for it way beyond any need. </p> <p>In 1931, Dorothy and Ted Hustead bought the local drugstore here. It was the middle of the Depression and business was slow. One hot July day, Dorothy watched the dust rising behind the passing cars and realised the people inside them would be thirsty. She put up a sign offering free ice-water. So many people stopped that the Husteads built a virtual empire on it. Practically every souvenir or craft shop along the wooden boardwalk now belongs to their family, rather like some towns in Scotland where woollen mills with different names mysteriously offer the same woolly jumpers. Here in Wall, you can buy expensive leather-fringed jackets or cheap dreamcatcher earrings, the cheapest of them made in China, where they'll churn out anybody's culture and undercut the natives. </p> <p>From this examplar of that proud marketing concept, the American Dream, you move into the Badlands, a strange, desolate place that could come out of a nightmare. Here, fantastically-shaped hills have erupted on the land like vomit from deep inside the earth. Catch the light right and you see bands of colour streaked along the surface, rich reds and purples. A few miles past the western entrance, where the land is still flat, is the Prairie Homestead. It's closed for the winter, but I peer through dusty windows into what looks like an outpost of Hell. This housed a family of the first settlers, or sodbusters. </p> <p>It's built into the sod, with grass covering the roof, and you can see that the earth floor inside is cracked. Outside it's a 30-yard walk to the privy, a shack where a wooden plank with two holes is perched above God knows what horrors. Rattlesnakes could lurk anywhere on the prairie, even in the rafters of the houses. Blizzards were so blinding that sometimes the people had to use a rope tied between the house and the barn to hold on to. The Homestead Act of 1862 offered a parcel of land to every settler who could secure a claim. It drew a million people here, undoubtedly one of the marketing triumphs of all time. </p> <p>After this detour, it's late by the time I reach Pierre, South Dakota's state capital, where the ghost dance shirt is held. The receptionist at my motel has heard of it, not surprisingly as she's a counsellor at Lower Brule Indian school. She says she'd like to think there's no prejudice against the Indians but there is really. It's the work ethic. They don't really have it. \"We keep trying to force it on them,\" she says. </p> <p>Next morning, I go to the South Dakota State Historical Society Museum, where director David Hartley takes me round one of the most wonderful museums I've ever been in. It shows the history of the people of South Dakota, from the Sioux creation myth to sodbusters and gold miners and right up to the present day. The Lakota believe they came from a cave deep inside the Black Hills, where they were first called the Buffalo Nation. But when they came to live on the surface of the earth, they became Ikce Wicasa, Ordinary People. This embracing of the ordinary strikes me as similar to Glaswegians' faith in the power of the workers. The parallels are even stronger with the Cheyennes, whose name for themselves is Tsetsehesestahase - We Are the People, a common Scottish football chant. </p> <p>\"The Lakota are more spiritual than we are,\" says Hartley. \"To them there was no status in accumulating possessions or wealth. You gained status in giving it away.\" Their name for generosity, one of their four cardinal virtues (the others are courage, wisdom and fortitude) was wacatognaka, the ability to give without a pounding heart. </p> <p>The exhibit cases here are filled with artefacts they gave away, often on ceremonial occasions - moccasins decorated with quillwork, an intricate Oglala beaded saddle blanket, tiny little beaded turtles given to new mothers to hold their babies' umbilical cords. Next to their lightness of spirit and the exquisite beauty of their workmanship, the soldiers' possessions are cumbersome and ugly - iron shackles, rifles, metal spurs, dark leather saddles. </p> <p>Glasgow's ghost dance shirt stands in a case of its own. It's a pale tan colour with rust-brown fringing and has some holes in the side with staining around. This looks ominously like blood, though it could be ink or anything. </p> <p>The ghost dance, a strange mix of Christianity and the Indians' own religion, tore through the Indian nations in 1889 and 90. It was non-violent and should have posed no threat to the white authorities, but they were afraid because the Indians were so crazed with the dance they did it for days on end, from dawn into the hours of darkness. A Paiute called Wovoka claimed he had seen the dance in a vision and that if the people performed it a Messiah would come to rescue them from the whites. If they wore special ghost dance shirts, the white man's bullets could not hurt them. Many Indians were wearing them when they died in the terrible massacre at Wounded Knee on December 29 1890. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the shirts are not rare. The museum already had one of its own when the Glasgow shirt was returned. </p> <p>It's dusk by the time I get down to Lake Sharpe, which offers the sportsman fishing and sailing. An Indian camp has been set up there on La Framboise Island to protest against the government's possession of the Sioux's sacred tribal lands, the Black Hills of Dakota. The tepees are deserted, but right at the end of the camp is the familiar sound of a television playing. Inside a large blue plastic marquee I find 21-year-old Richard Shangreaux, who says the Sioux are the caretakers of the earth. He's an Oglala, of the Teton nation, and he grew up in a tepee. </p> <p>He has the fine face of a brave, the chiselled nose and high cheekbones. He also has an anorak. \"We walk in spirituality. It's not a religion, it's a way of life,\" he says, taking a taco out of its plastic wrapper and munching on it. \"They're scared of our spirituality. They're not scared of us physically. They've got the biggest guns in the world.\" </p> <p>A smaller Indian joins him, 23-year-old LeGrand Wells, a Hunkpapa Sioux who was brought up in the city of Minneapolis. He says he wants to learn about the traditional ways of his people, though he's scared he might not make it through the cold winter. </p> <p>They invite me into the tepee where they keep a sacred fire burning 24 hours a day. A chair with a blanket thrown over sits by the side of it. They say it's for the spirit of the fire, Yellow Horse. Inside, the tepee is cosy as a cocoon, with soft fabrics and cushions scattered everywhere. As a way of coping with the rigours of the Dakota winter it seems infinitely more attractive than the Prairie Homestead. \"They did so much and worked so hard to make us forget who we are,\" says LeGrand. \"It almost worked.\" Richard throws some sweetgrass into the fire. We sit in the warmth and we are all thinking of the wrongs that have been done the Indian people, as the flames and the scented grass whisper upwards to the roof poles of the tepee and through to the night outside. </p> <p>How close Indian hopes are to going up in smoke is evident the next day at the Wounded Knee massacre site. The road there is through the eastern gate of the Badlands, over the White River, where 3,000 Sioux danced the Ghost Dance in the snow for days together, past cliffs and buttes all puckered up like pleating. This is the Pine Ridge reservation, with straggly little towns where many live in trailers with several cars parked outside, some working, some not. Like the people. Everyone here is on food stamps. </p> <p>Beyond Kyle, the road deteriorates suddenly, becoming like a rally track. Finally, at Wounded Knee, we're back on the highway. But the Indians have clearly not mastered the white man's art of packaging their history. There is no visitor centre, no gift shop or tearoom, only a couple of stalls that have been closed up for the season. A plain metal sign tells the story of the massacre, which happened in the Moon of Popping Trees (December-January) 1890. Hundreds of Indian men, women and children were gunned down by US soldiers. Many of the women were fleeing, their babies in their arms. </p> <p>As I try to decipher where everything actually happened, a car suddenly revs up and drives all of 20 yards to sit by mine. An Indian sticks his head out of the car. He says his name is Jeremy and hands me a leaflet welcoming me to the Oglala Lakota nation. Then he asks if I'm interested in arts and crafts. He pulls out a bundle of dreamcatchers and medicine wheels, ranging from $15 to $30. \"I'll give you a good deal if you take more than one,\" he offers. I discover I have no cash left. \"Can you give me a few dollars then?\" he says. </p> <p>Indian culture and history are for sale throughout the state of South Dakota, not necessarily by Indians, but the reservation itself is a depressing place, a reminder of how much the Indians have lost in becoming part of the American nation. In Pine Ridge itself, the main social attraction seems to be the local Texaco station, where Indians sit round chatting and eating greasy food. </p> <p>Just outside Pine Ridge, on the Nebraska border, is another protest camp, Camp Justice. Last June (the Moon When the Chokecherries Are Ripe), two Indian men were found dead in a ditch 100 yards north of this mud-caked field. Their throats were slit, their faces and bodies heavily bruised, their wrists swollen after being tightly bound. No one has been brought to justice for their murder. </p> <p>This is the underside of the tourist industry that brings so much money to this area in the summer. It's a black hole in the heart of South Dakota, a place where no visitor would willingly choose to go. Beyond the reservation, and into the Black Hills, things are much more comfortable and even downright touristy. Hot Springs, a spa town, and Hill City are both charming places where you buy Indian souvenirs without con fronting the misery of the Indians themselves. </p> <p>Between them lie miles of beautiful parkland, not the Jane Austen rolling variety but rugged hills black with trees, and clear blue skies streaked with fantastical clouds you can understand Indian artists seeing visions in. As Wind Cave National Park gives way to Custer State Park, you see deer and wild turkeys and even a herd of little donkeys. On the Wildlife Loop road is a prairie dog town, where hundreds of these rabbit-like creatures live in the animal equivalent of a shanty town, their burrows littering the ground like hundreds of miniature rubbish dumps. </p> <p>Most fascinating of all is the sight of herds of buffalo roaming free on the hills as they once roamed right across the Great Plains. Signs warn you they are unpredictable, but they seem gentle creatures, standing stolidly chewing grass or lying dead asleep. They are so close to your car you can see the dust on their flanks and the yellow burrs that have clung to their faces. </p> <p>The buffalo are a reminder that what is lost can be built up again, as the Indians are trying to restore their own culture and religion. But the sacred tribal lands of the Black Hills have become sacred to the white man, too - for the money they generate. More than 2.5 million people a year visit Mount Rushmore, with its car parks and gift shops and sculptures of dead politicians. You walk up an avenue draped with state flags, its triumphalism queasily reminiscent of Nazi architecture. Then, from above the $10 million amphitheatre, you look across at the carved stone faces of Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln. And it's strangely disappointing. The achievement is remarkable, the workmanship magnificent, but you're left wondering, what does it all mean? Are these grim-faced men the whole of American history? Are they even the best of it? </p> <p>Just a few miles south of Hill City is the Crazy Horse Memorial, built when Chief Henry Standing Bear of the Sioux wrote to sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski saying his people \"would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too\". Crazy Horse was a warrior and a visionary leader, who believed this world was not the real world. Through dreams he entered the real world, the world of spirits, where his horse floated and danced. Ziolkowski and his wife Ruth decided the memorial, of Crazy Horse on his stallion, would be the largest ever built, nearly 600ft high. </p> <p>The work has been in progress for 50 years and is still not finished, partly because the Ziolkowski family refuse to accept government funding, partly because it is so colossal. The place is a building site, the horse's head is only sketched in. But you look up above the trees and see the stern face of the man, his hair flying out behind him in the stone wind; you see the beauty of the horse; and you think of freedom. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Jean Rafferty organised her trip through STA travel (020 73616262), flying from Glasgow to Rapid City via Minneapolis at a cost oif \u00a3264 return plus tax.

      "bodyText": "The journey began in November, the month the Lakota Sioux call the Moon When the Wolves Run Together, in my home city of Glasgow. It was to take me across the ocean and half a continent away to South Dakota on the trail of the American Indian. In 1892, Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show came to Glasgow and created a sensation, as it did throughout Europe. The people of my city were wild for it, especially for the Indians and their fantastic costumes. A member of the troupe gave a Lakota Sioux ghost dance shirt to Kelvingrove art gallery and museum. I remember seeing it there as a child, along with a model of an Indian Plains family, all dressed in buckskin and beading. But in 1999 Glasgow recognised the shirt as an important piece of Sioux history and returned it to the tribe. As the plane flies into Minneapolis, the city lights spread out below us, I am struck with the thought of the strangeness of cities. The great plains where the Indians roamed in search of buffalo are now a great forest of pale orange and yellow, miles and miles of artificial lights laid out on the land like millions of barren Christmas trees. Instead of a people at one with nature, we have become aliens on the earth, people who can't see the stars in the sky for the orange haze above our streets. On to Rapid City and then the long drive across the prairie. The roads are so endless and so empty that you wonder how the Indians and the whites ever ran into each other. I stop at Wall, a little town on the edge of the South Dakota Badlands. It's a curious experience, one of those delights that Western capitalism throws up, a place that flourishes because a demand has been created for it way beyond any need. In 1931, Dorothy and Ted Hustead bought the local drugstore here. It was the middle of the Depression and business was slow. One hot July day, Dorothy watched the dust rising behind the passing cars and realised the people inside them would be thirsty. She put up a sign offering free ice-water. So many people stopped that the Husteads built a virtual empire on it. Practically every souvenir or craft shop along the wooden boardwalk now belongs to their family, rather like some towns in Scotland where woollen mills with different names mysteriously offer the same woolly jumpers. Here in Wall, you can buy expensive leather-fringed jackets or cheap dreamcatcher earrings, the cheapest of them made in China, where they'll churn out anybody's culture and undercut the natives. From this examplar of that proud marketing concept, the American Dream, you move into the Badlands, a strange, desolate place that could come out of a nightmare. Here, fantastically-shaped hills have erupted on the land like vomit from deep inside the earth. Catch the light right and you see bands of colour streaked along the surface, rich reds and purples. A few miles past the western entrance, where the land is still flat, is the Prairie Homestead. It's closed for the winter, but I peer through dusty windows into what looks like an outpost of Hell. This housed a family of the first settlers, or sodbusters. It's built into the sod, with grass covering the roof, and you can see that the earth floor inside is cracked. Outside it's a 30-yard walk to the privy, a shack where a wooden plank with two holes is perched above God knows what horrors. Rattlesnakes could lurk anywhere on the prairie, even in the rafters of the houses. Blizzards were so blinding that sometimes the people had to use a rope tied between the house and the barn to hold on to. The Homestead Act of 1862 offered a parcel of land to every settler who could secure a claim. It drew a million people here, undoubtedly one of the marketing triumphs of all time. After this detour, it's late by the time I reach Pierre, South Dakota's state capital, where the ghost dance shirt is held. The receptionist at my motel has heard of it, not surprisingly as she's a counsellor at Lower Brule Indian school. She says she'd like to think there's no prejudice against the Indians but there is really. It's the work ethic. They don't really have it. \"We keep trying to force it on them,\" she says. Next morning, I go to the South Dakota State Historical Society Museum, where director David Hartley takes me round one of the most wonderful museums I've ever been in. It shows the history of the people of South Dakota, from the Sioux creation myth to sodbusters and gold miners and right up to the present day. The Lakota believe they came from a cave deep inside the Black Hills, where they were first called the Buffalo Nation. But when they came to live on the surface of the earth, they became Ikce Wicasa, Ordinary People. This embracing of the ordinary strikes me as similar to Glaswegians' faith in the power of the workers. The parallels are even stronger with the Cheyennes, whose name for themselves is Tsetsehesestahase - We Are the People, a common Scottish football chant. \"The Lakota are more spiritual than we are,\" says Hartley. \"To them there was no status in accumulating possessions or wealth. You gained status in giving it away.\" Their name for generosity, one of their four cardinal virtues (the others are courage, wisdom and fortitude) was wacatognaka, the ability to give without a pounding heart. The exhibit cases here are filled with artefacts they gave away, often on ceremonial occasions - moccasins decorated with quillwork, an intricate Oglala beaded saddle blanket, tiny little beaded turtles given to new mothers to hold their babies' umbilical cords. Next to their lightness of spirit and the exquisite beauty of their workmanship, the soldiers' possessions are cumbersome and ugly - iron shackles, rifles, metal spurs, dark leather saddles. Glasgow's ghost dance shirt stands in a case of its own. It's a pale tan colour with rust-brown fringing and has some holes in the side with staining around. This looks ominously like blood, though it could be ink or anything. The ghost dance, a strange mix of Christianity and the Indians' own religion, tore through the Indian nations in 1889 and 90. It was non-violent and should have posed no threat to the white authorities, but they were afraid because the Indians were so crazed with the dance they did it for days on end, from dawn into the hours of darkness. A Paiute called Wovoka claimed he had seen the dance in a vision and that if the people performed it a Messiah would come to rescue them from the whites. If they wore special ghost dance shirts, the white man's bullets could not hurt them. Many Indians were wearing them when they died in the terrible massacre at Wounded Knee on December 29 1890. Surprisingly, the shirts are not rare. The museum already had one of its own when the Glasgow shirt was returned. It's dusk by the time I get down to Lake Sharpe, which offers the sportsman fishing and sailing. An Indian camp has been set up there on La Framboise Island to protest against the government's possession of the Sioux's sacred tribal lands, the Black Hills of Dakota. The tepees are deserted, but right at the end of the camp is the familiar sound of a television playing. Inside a large blue plastic marquee I find 21-year-old Richard Shangreaux, who says the Sioux are the caretakers of the earth. He's an Oglala, of the Teton nation, and he grew up in a tepee. He has the fine face of a brave, the chiselled nose and high cheekbones. He also has an anorak. \"We walk in spirituality. It's not a religion, it's a way of life,\" he says, taking a taco out of its plastic wrapper and munching on it. \"They're scared of our spirituality. They're not scared of us physically. They've got the biggest guns in the world.\" A smaller Indian joins him, 23-year-old LeGrand Wells, a Hunkpapa Sioux who was brought up in the city of Minneapolis. He says he wants to learn about the traditional ways of his people, though he's scared he might not make it through the cold winter. They invite me into the tepee where they keep a sacred fire burning 24 hours a day. A chair with a blanket thrown over sits by the side of it. They say it's for the spirit of the fire, Yellow Horse. Inside, the tepee is cosy as a cocoon, with soft fabrics and cushions scattered everywhere. As a way of coping with the rigours of the Dakota winter it seems infinitely more attractive than the Prairie Homestead. \"They did so much and worked so hard to make us forget who we are,\" says LeGrand. \"It almost worked.\" Richard throws some sweetgrass into the fire. We sit in the warmth and we are all thinking of the wrongs that have been done the Indian people, as the flames and the scented grass whisper upwards to the roof poles of the tepee and through to the night outside. How close Indian hopes are to going up in smoke is evident the next day at the Wounded Knee massacre site. The road there is through the eastern gate of the Badlands, over the White River, where 3,000 Sioux danced the Ghost Dance in the snow for days together, past cliffs and buttes all puckered up like pleating. This is the Pine Ridge reservation, with straggly little towns where many live in trailers with several cars parked outside, some working, some not. Like the people. Everyone here is on food stamps. Beyond Kyle, the road deteriorates suddenly, becoming like a rally track. Finally, at Wounded Knee, we're back on the highway. But the Indians have clearly not mastered the white man's art of packaging their history. There is no visitor centre, no gift shop or tearoom, only a couple of stalls that have been closed up for the season. A plain metal sign tells the story of the massacre, which happened in the Moon of Popping Trees (December-January) 1890. Hundreds of Indian men, women and children were gunned down by US soldiers. Many of the women were fleeing, their babies in their arms. As I try to decipher where everything actually happened, a car suddenly revs up and drives all of 20 yards to sit by mine. An Indian sticks his head out of the car. He says his name is Jeremy and hands me a leaflet welcoming me to the Oglala Lakota nation. Then he asks if I'm interested in arts and crafts. He pulls out a bundle of dreamcatchers and medicine wheels, ranging from $15 to $30. \"I'll give you a good deal if you take more than one,\" he offers. I discover I have no cash left. \"Can you give me a few dollars then?\" he says. Indian culture and history are for sale throughout the state of South Dakota, not necessarily by Indians, but the reservation itself is a depressing place, a reminder of how much the Indians have lost in becoming part of the American nation. In Pine Ridge itself, the main social attraction seems to be the local Texaco station, where Indians sit round chatting and eating greasy food.

      "body": "<p>Two great romances and just about everything else of note that's gone on in Samos happened at least 2,000 years ago. Admittedly almost everywhere you go in the Mediterranean seems to have had a brief spell in the BC era when three men, two dogs and a few fast triremes ruled the known world. And you wouldn't want to underplay Samos's AD years when the island has been successively occupied by Romans, Goths, Huns, Venetians, Genoese and, for centuries, Turks, and has seen them all off. </p> <p>But it was the sixth century BC that spanned Samos's glory days. Democracy had already come and gone. Polycrates - tyrant, legalised pirate and patron of arts and monumental architecture - had seized dominion over the island and the whole of the Aegean. And, at the same time, Pythagoras was working out his right-angled triangle theorem. A couple of centuries later, a Samian mathematician realised that the earth circled the sun, rather than vice versa, at least a millennium and a half before Copernicus. </p> <p>Of the island's great lovers, Antony and Cleopatra, who called by in the first century BC with their pet leopard, asses' milk baths and exotic dancers, were perhaps the most sybaritic. Hera, queen of the gods, and her lover (and brother) Zeus were undoubtedly the most indefatigable: their wedding night lasted 300 years, and Hera, initially a reluctant bride, later a jealous wife, perpetually renewed her virginity by bathing in the sacred river Imvrasos. The river is still there and so is Hera's temple, once one of the wonders of the ancient world, now knee-high ruins with one solitary pillar standing. </p> <p>Samos is not quite so cutesy and pretty as some of the other Greek islands. The towns have a business-like air. Samians used to be great ship-builders, now they make their living - aside from tourism - from olive oil and wine growing, including a grand cru dessert wine that is used as a communion wine in some countries (not sure if that is a recommendation). There must be quite a bit of rain some of the year, because the island is very green; there are miles of pine forest, several proper mountains and beautiful, sculpted valleys scattered with cypress trees like exclamation marks. </p> <p>I first went to Samos in the 1970s as a backpacker heading for Turkey. By mistake we got off the Athens ferry at Karlovassi, the lesser of Samos's two ports and finally pitched up at Pythagorio, birthplace of the geometrician. We stayed with a couple of old ladies who rented out rooms. </p> <p>Back then, there were maybe half a dozen tavernas and a kind of dairy selling Greek coffee and yogurt, and that was it. Now it is the premier resort of Samos: yachts are moored all along Polycrates's harbour; jewellery shops stand shoulder to shoulder up the high street, and there are hundreds of restaurants and bars. Purists might call it commercialised - I rather like it. In any case, in Pythagoras's day, the town allegedly had a population of 250,000, six times that of the entire island today. </p> <p>The Turkish coast is only a couple of kilometres across the water from Pythagorio, but when we were first there, only one small ferry made the crossing and you were vigorously discouraged from using it - \"Don't you know they have a typhoid epidemic over there.\" Now there are hydrofoil connections, day trips to Ephesus, regular ferries. You might hear the odd anti-Turkish jibe, but business is business. The real animosity in the spring of 1999 - at least expressed in the graffiti - was directed at Nato for its incursions in Kosovo. </p> <p>Not that we heard much about that where we were stay ing in Ormos Marathokampos, a little fishing village on the south-west coast of Samos that has a couple of bakeries, a few tavernas, a harbour and a beach. It's the kind of place where you get to know people fast. Yani, who reckoned to make the \"best pizzas this side of Naples\" at his waterside caf\u00e9, had run a pizza parlour in Cleveland for 27 years before retiring to his native Samos. He spends the winter working on the land and picking up olives. Quite a modest workload compared with some. </p> <p>Our landlord Costa (we were staying in a self-catering villa) also runs an olive-pressing factory. And, as for Manoli, a restaurateur along the coast, he has his own wine label, an \"interest\" in olives, helps his father with his charcoal burning in the hills, and is a partner in a bike- and car-rental business. When we met him, he'd just been entertaining some tax inspectors from Lesbos and - how well-organised is he? - they brought him clams and rare and very salty sardines, only found in Lesbos waters, that you eat raw. </p> <p>On our first day, when good intentions of taking lots of exercise were running high, we set off on a long walk eastward along the bay from Ormos. It was as we turned inland, away from the sea breeze, that we got that first blast of hot, sweet-scented air, that in itself is a reason to visit Greece in springtime. The combined smell of massed wild flowers and oleander, a bit herby, thyme probably, sweeps over you like maple syrup - or Pyrgos honey. Along the road to Chora and Pythagorio, roadside stalls sell bags of fantastically aromatic oregano and and tins of honey from, so the label says, \"thyme, coniferous trees, flowers\". </p> <p>Routinely, all Samos's beaches have the prefix \"pure white sand\" in guide books - this is not strictly or even loosely true. Quite a few are pebbly. Psili Ammos beach, two or three kilometres west of Ormos, is a beautiful exception and it is a good place to begin an exploration of the wild west end of Samos, where Mount Kerkis plunges into the sea, and rarely-used tracks lead to empty coves. </p> <p>Samos is an island of motorbikes - well, they're mostly 50cc motor scooters, styled to look like motorbikes. They're for hire everywhere. Ours had \"Ultimate Weapon\" painted on the tank to give that Harley feeling. Zig-zagging up the hills, sun on your back, breeze in your face, magnificent scenery - it is a delightful way to travel. Which is why the walking programme came to rather a standstill, and why we didn't even contemplate climbing Mount Kerkis. This is the highest mountain on Samos, indeed in this part of the Aegean (a bit under 1,500m); a dormant volcano that looms over Ormos, handsome but slightly ominous - the kind of granite lump that might look more tempting with a snowcap. </p> <p>It presented a challenge to our fellow holiday-makers: two with climbing boots, waterbottle, plus crampons and ropes probably, failed to reach the top having set off at 5am. Another couple tried the after-lunch, flips-flops and ouzo method, and failed, too. Finally an unassuming man in khaki shorts, who used to walk the Peak District, cracked it and was down again in time for a siesta. </p> <p>Actually, what I missed most from the back-packing days was not lengthy treks on foot, but the island-hopping - the pleasure of being at the mercy of master seamen who, however erratic their timetabling, can charge at a 12ft quay at 20 knots, swivel and park on a sixpence. So we took a smallish jobbing ferry to Ikaria, a neighbouring island, along with a slate lorry, a jeep, a few soldiers (plenty of those in this part of the world), a couple of fellows in windcheaters and a school of backgammon players. </p> <p>The island is so-named because Icarus, son of Daedalus the inventor, fell into the sea and drowned just off the south coast when the sun melted the wax on his wings. Locals can take you to the precise spot. Anyone would think it was a true story. More recently, Ikaria was a dumping ground for communists and other dissidents during the colonels' era, and it still has a reputation for being pretty (as have most of the islands). </p> <p>We landed at the capital, Agios Kyrikos, a workaday little town, and walked along the cliff path to Therma, a seaside spa with numerous hot springs, once a resort popular with Greeks, especially those suffering from rheuma tism or gout. But, in decline and out of season, there was a torpid, Death in Venice vibe about the place, which a soak in a bathful of steaming hot, radioactive water did nothing to dispel. Quite the contrary. Still there were signs of something about to happen: chairs were lined up outside restaurants for a lick of paint; an earthmover shifted sand from one end of the beach to the other; hotel foyers were getting a scrubdown. I can imagine it would be a pleasant place to stay, even - or especially - if you have aching joints and sore feet. </p> <p>On the far side of Ikaria, there is apparently a ravishing beach and the beginnings of one or two small resorts. I hope they won't be the Death of Therma. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Helen Oldfield was the guest of Laskarina Holidays (0629 822203/4). Prices for two weeks at Ormos Marakampos, Samos, in self-catering accomodation from \u00a3460pp in May (inc flight) to \u00a3645 in August. Laskarina also has, for the first time this year, accomodation and hotel rooms on the north coast of Ikaria, which cost around \u00a350-\u00a3100 less than equivalents on Samos. The ferry between Samos and Ikaria costs \u00a36 return, more on a hydrofoil.</p>",

And you wouldn't want to underplay Samos's AD years when the island has been successively occupied by Romans, Goths, Huns, Venetians, Genoese and, for centuries, Turks, and has seen them all off. But it was the sixth century BC that spanned Samos's glory days. Democracy had already come and gone. Polycrates - tyrant, legalised pirate and patron of arts and monumental architecture - had seized dominion over the island and the whole of the Aegean. And, at the same time, Pythagoras was working out his right-angled triangle theorem. A couple of centuries later, a Samian mathematician realised that the earth circled the sun, rather than vice versa, at least a millennium and a half before Copernicus. Of the island's great lovers, Antony and Cleopatra, who called by in the first century BC with their pet leopard, asses' milk baths and exotic dancers, were perhaps the most sybaritic. Hera, queen of the gods, and her lover (and brother) Zeus were undoubtedly the most indefatigable: their wedding night lasted 300 years, and Hera, initially a reluctant bride, later a jealous wife, perpetually renewed her virginity by bathing in the sacred river Imvrasos. The river is still there and so is Hera's temple, once one of the wonders of the ancient world, now knee-high ruins with one solitary pillar standing. Samos is not quite so cutesy and pretty as some of the other Greek islands. The towns have a business-like air. Samians used to be great ship-builders, now they make their living - aside from tourism - from olive oil and wine growing, including a grand cru dessert wine that is used as a communion wine in some countries (not sure if that is a recommendation). There must be quite a bit of rain some of the year, because the island is very green; there are miles of pine forest, several proper mountains and beautiful, sculpted valleys scattered with cypress trees like exclamation marks. I first went to Samos in the 1970s as a backpacker heading for Turkey. By mistake we got off the Athens ferry at Karlovassi, the lesser of Samos's two ports and finally pitched up at Pythagorio, birthplace of the geometrician. We stayed with a couple of old ladies who rented out rooms. Back then, there were maybe half a dozen tavernas and a kind of dairy selling Greek coffee and yogurt, and that was it. Now it is the premier resort of Samos: yachts are moored all along Polycrates's harbour; jewellery shops stand shoulder to shoulder up the high street, and there are hundreds of restaurants and bars. Purists might call it commercialised - I rather like it. In any case, in Pythagoras's day, the town allegedly had a population of 250,000, six times that of the entire island today. The Turkish coast is only a couple of kilometres across the water from Pythagorio, but when we were first there, only one small ferry made the crossing and you were vigorously discouraged from using it - \"Don't you know they have a typhoid epidemic over there.\" Now there are hydrofoil connections, day trips to Ephesus, regular ferries. You might hear the odd anti-Turkish jibe, but business is business. The real animosity in the spring of 1999 - at least expressed in the graffiti - was directed at Nato for its incursions in Kosovo. Not that we heard much about that where we were stay ing in Ormos Marathokampos, a little fishing village on the south-west coast of Samos that has a couple of bakeries, a few tavernas, a harbour and a beach. It's the kind of place where you get to know people fast. Yani, who reckoned to make the \"best pizzas this side of Naples\" at his waterside caf\u00e9, had run a pizza parlour in Cleveland for 27 years before retiring to his native Samos. He spends the winter working on the land and picking up olives. Quite a modest workload compared with some. Our landlord Costa (we were staying in a self-catering villa) also runs an olive-pressing factory. And, as for Manoli, a restaurateur along the coast, he has his own wine label, an \"interest\" in olives, helps his father with his charcoal burning in the hills, and is a partner in a bike- and car-rental business. When we met him, he'd just been entertaining some tax inspectors from Lesbos and - how well-organised is he? - they brought him clams and rare and very salty sardines, only found in Lesbos waters, that you eat raw. On our first day, when good intentions of taking lots of exercise were running high, we set off on a long walk eastward along the bay from Ormos. It was as we turned inland, away from the sea breeze, that we got that first blast of hot, sweet-scented air, that in itself is a reason to visit Greece in springtime. The combined smell of massed wild flowers and oleander, a bit herby, thyme probably, sweeps over you like maple syrup - or Pyrgos honey. Along the road to Chora and Pythagorio, roadside stalls sell bags of fantastically aromatic oregano and and tins of honey from, so the label says, \"thyme, coniferous trees, flowers\". Routinely, all Samos's beaches have the prefix \"pure white sand\" in guide books - this is not strictly or even loosely true. Quite a few are pebbly. Psili Ammos beach, two or three kilometres west of Ormos, is a beautiful exception and it is a good place to begin an exploration of the wild west end of Samos, where Mount Kerkis plunges into the sea, and rarely-used tracks lead to empty coves. Samos is an island of motorbikes - well, they're mostly 50cc motor scooters, styled to look like motorbikes. They're for hire everywhere. Ours had \"Ultimate Weapon\" painted on the tank to give that Harley feeling. Zig-zagging up the hills, sun on your back, breeze in your face, magnificent scenery - it is a delightful way to travel. Which is why the walking programme came to rather a standstill, and why we didn't even contemplate climbing Mount Kerkis. This is the highest mountain on Samos, indeed in this part of the Aegean (a bit under 1,500m); a dormant volcano that looms over Ormos, handsome but slightly ominous - the kind of granite lump that might look more tempting with a snowcap. It presented a challenge to our fellow holiday-makers: two with climbing boots, waterbottle, plus crampons and ropes probably, failed to reach the top having set off at 5am. Another couple tried the after-lunch, flips-flops and ouzo method, and failed, too. Finally an unassuming man in khaki shorts, who used to walk the Peak District, cracked it and was down again in time for a siesta. Actually, what I missed most from the back-packing days was not lengthy treks on foot, but the island-hopping - the pleasure of being at the mercy of master seamen who, however erratic their timetabling, can charge at a 12ft quay at 20 knots, swivel and park on a sixpence. So we took a smallish jobbing ferry to Ikaria, a neighbouring island, along with a slate lorry, a jeep, a few soldiers (plenty of those in this part of the world), a couple of fellows in windcheaters and a school of backgammon players. The island is so-named because Icarus, son of Daedalus the inventor, fell into the sea and drowned just off the south coast when the sun melted the wax on his wings. Locals can take you to the precise spot. Anyone would think it was a true story. More recently, Ikaria was a dumping ground for communists and other dissidents during the colonels' era, and it still has a reputation for being pretty (as have most of the islands). We landed at the capital, Agios Kyrikos, a workaday little town, and walked along the cliff path to Therma, a seaside spa with numerous hot springs, once a resort popular with Greeks, especially those suffering from rheuma tism or gout. But, in decline and out of season, there was a torpid, Death in Venice vibe about the place, which a soak in a bathful of steaming hot, radioactive water did nothing to dispel. Quite the contrary. Still there were signs of something about to happen: chairs were lined up outside restaurants for a lick of paint; an earthmover shifted sand from one end of the beach to the other; hotel foyers were getting a scrubdown. I can imagine it would be a pleasant place to stay, even - or especially - if you have aching joints and sore feet. On the far side of Ikaria, there is apparently a ravishing beach and the beginnings of one or two small resorts. I hope they won't be the Death of Therma. The practicals Helen Oldfield was the guest of Laskarina Holidays (0629 822203/4). Prices for two weeks at Ormos Marakampos, Samos, in self-catering accomodation from \u00a3460pp in May (inc flight) to \u00a3645 in August. Laskarina also has, for the first time this year, accomodation and hotel rooms on the north coast of Ikaria, which cost around \u00a350-\u00a3100 less than equivalents on Samos. The ferry between Samos and Ikaria costs \u00a36 return, more on a hydrofoil.",

      "body": "<p>It was Christopher Potter - now the much-lauded publishing director of Fourth Estate but, back in 1990, a lowly commissioning editor - who \"discovered\" novelist Carol Shields for a British audience. Though, of course, a writer is not really \"discovered\". It's a bit like that silly joke: what was the highest mountain in the world before Everest was found? Carol Shields's voice is her own; she \"discovered\" herself. Still, it was the meticulous Potter, trawling through small Canadian, American and Australian publishers looking for writers - \"I knew there were bound to be people who'd been overlooked\" - who one day picked up her novel, Mary Swann, then published by a \"tiny, ramshackle\" firm in eastern Canada, read it and loved it. </p> <p>So much so that he got hold of her remaining backlist - four novels and a book of short stories - read those, and took the decision to publish the lot. </p> <p>Shields's work had already done the rounds of British publishers and been \"overlooked\" by everybody. Yet Potter knew instantly, from the first paragraph: \"A character tells a joke about the way she dresses that tells you a lot about her, about her flaws; it tells you she can see her flaws but is unable to do anything about them. It is human and funny, and I knew here was an unusual and a major voice.\" But then Potter- a former maths student with an MSc in philosophy of science- who came into publishing because it was the first job he was offered, is himself quite unusual. \"I never had a plan, no overarching structure\" - none of what Shields has designated \"ejaculatory narrative\" ie linear, plot-driven, resolution-driven. </p> <p>Potter didn't have any preconceived notions of good writing. \"I could please myself,\" he says. And it just so happened that what pleased him also pleased a great many others. Mary Swann was published to great critical acclaim, with reviewers asking, \"Where has this major writer been hidden?\" Four years later, The Stone Diaries, the 80-year chronicle of Daisy Goodwill Flett's miserably unsatisfied middle-class life, was short-listed for the Booker, only losing when the chair of the judging panel, Lord Gowrie, put his casting vote behind Roddy Doyle. In 1995, The Stone Diaries won the Pulitzer Prize. \"I could easily have been a Daisy Flett,\" says Carol Shields. \"One of those women who erases herself, who somehow slips out of her own life. I only missed it by one generation.\" Shields was born in 1935, the fictional Daisy in 1905. \"Still, thank god for Christopher,\" says Shields, who hasn't believed in god since the age of six. </p> <p>There are connections, interstices, moments in a life that seem to change its entire trajectory, and some of them are obvious - getting your book published, the moment when Daisy's first husband, Harold, falls out of the bedroom window on their honeymoon night and is killed. But most of them aren't. All of Shields's writing implicitly asks the question: suppose life is as much in the minutiae as it is in the big picture. We tend to hang our lives on, or fashion them out of, the dramatic episodes - birth, death, love, hate, war - because they impress a pattern on our world. But suppose there is no pattern, or that the pattern is in the detail - most lives are lived in detail: a new recipe for soup, how to find time to take the cat to the vet - and we tend to disregard the detail, or to regard it with contempt, as though it is somehow keeping us from the real business of living. \"Ordinary\" has become a term of abuse, so to say that Shields chronicles \"ordinary lives\" will sound disparaging to some ears. Anyway, as she says, \"I don't believe in ordinary or extraordinary people, unless we are all extraordinary.\" She is interested in biography, in how we construct the stories of our own lives and other people's - what we select, what we leave out. Why are we curious about other people, she asks. Are we curious enough about our own lives? </p> <p>Shields is a feminist, and has been all her life, though she gave this sensibility a name only after reading Betty Friedan in the 70s. When she started writing, she wanted specifically to write about women, family loyalties, \"people like me\": subject matter that seems conservative. Even she was afraid it was dull. \"I didn't think there would be an audience outside women's magazines.\" But her interest in structure would always mark her as unusual. Happenstance, her third novel, was the dissection of a marriage told from both points of view - first one, then the other. Mary Swann examines the life of a murdered poetess from the perspectives of four individuals, each of whom are obsessed by her. In Larry's Party, her last novel, and a book about a man, the structure mimics the convoluted workings of Larry's thought. The Stone Diaries is the biography of a woman who slowly writes herself out of her own life. And so on. It's not that she has an agenda, she says. \"It's just that clearly, if you write a few books, you are going to write about the things that concern you deeply, and perhaps even more deeply than you'd like to confess to. For me, I object to the casual dismissal of women that I so often see.\" </p> <p>Childhood is built for happiness, and yet there is almost always something ineradicably sad about it. For Shields, I think, it was her parents' silence. Though they were, she says, the best parents they were able to be, they didn't talk to their children, and for Shields - who is a wonderful listener, who seems scarcely to want to talk herself if she can listen - this must have been so lonely. Anyway, she is married to someone, Don, \"43 years this summer\", who loves to talk. \"He likes nothing more than a table full of people, all talking.\" </p> <p> Shields was born in Chicago 64 years ago, in the pretty suburb of Oakland. She was the third child. Her brother and sister are twins - which could have been the root of the loneliness. But no, she says, she never felt excluded. \"I was everyone's little darling.\" Her mother, Ines, of Swedish descent and from whom she must inherit her golden hair, used to tell her that she was an accident. \"She turned it into a blessing, so I never minded. But I remember reading how Nancy Friday's life was ruined by her mother telling her that same thing, and I thought, 'Oh, it all depends on how it's said.'\" </p> <p>Life was ordered. A prairie-style house, four rooms up, four rooms down. Church every Sunday. Family meals in the evenings, when her father would serve and carve. \"I think he liked that role. Apart from that, I didn't know him very well. I don't think we ever had a real conversation.\" The thing about children, she says, is that they are not very interested in childhood, they take it for granted. Of course, there are things that you know as a child that stay with you always. \"The way that children have of really knowing the surface of their lives. I could put my hand now on a particular square of linoleum in our kitchen and know exactly how it felt.\" She, too, plays that game at night, when unable to sleep, of revisiting every room of her childhood home, and then every cupboard and every drawer. </p> <p>But so much is lost, she says, or goes unexamined. As a child, she relished her mother's vast family of seven siblings. \"All dead now.\" (Her mother was the youngest. Was she, perhaps, the accident?) She accepted the fact that her father was alone in the world, that his family was a sort of blank. \"All I know about my father's mother is something my mother once told me. That her name was Pearce and that she was 'Proud to be a Pearce'.\" What should be inferred from this? That the mother-in- law thought her not good enough to marry her son. Not that anything would ever be said. \"Ours was a quiet house, reserved . . . I do not come from a storytelling family.\" </p> <p>Details. Uncle Harry, her mother's brother, who lost a leg in the first world war and whose mother could never be told. \"I've always wondered what sort of woman she was that she could not bear that news.\" The terrible nightmares she had when she was 10 about a child murder in a Chicago park. \"It's a problem what you tell children, how much you protect them. It's how you present it, I suppose.\" No chance of protection here, with all the mothers talking, huddled in groups, full of whispers and anecdote. Later, Shields would turn this into a short story. \"The only real violence of my childhood.\" </p> <p>The violence of the war impinged upon her as a child, but as an inconvenience more than a reality. She was six when it began and nine when it ended; the surprise in that, she says, is that it seemed so very long at the time. She is famous in her family for declaring when the war ended: \"Good. There will be no more news.\" To the child, the war was an interruption of life, not life itself. \"We didn't even know where Germany was.\" There were no nightmares about this enemy. This killing was more of a game. At school, on the wall hung a huge poster of a man swinging a sword over the heads of some \"Japs\", and every time someone got 100% marks, the sword would chop through another body. In the schoolyard, there were \"scrap drives\". \"And, as you jumped on the tin can, you shouted, 'Kill that Jap'.\" Shields's most potent memory of this time is of her mother on VJ Day running out on to the porch, a carving fork held aloft - because, naturally, she was in the middle of cooking - shouting \"un-con-di-tio-nal surr-en-der\", with a break after every syllable, so that the words rolled like thunder. It was so unlike her, Shields says. </p> <p>Shields would never write about war, \"would never be interested to write about it,\" and it's true that not even in The Stone Diaries, which spans most of the last century, does it make an appearance, apart from \"exterior little curls\". This is not simply because it is a male subject, though that, too. \"The modelling of war is very male. Women don't write a great deal about war.\" Certainly, there is a level at which this is a version of the feminist his/story, her/story - history is male, made by men and related by men. But it is also, for Shields, a matter of taste, of sensibility. For her, it's as if life is a magnet, constantly attaching random bits and pieces to itself. What she has is that extraordinary gift of seeming to find everything interesting, while lavishing the same democratic care on every detail demanding her attention - I hesitate to say - like a good mother. But maybe it is the same kind of nurturing, this evenhandedness, this sympathetic ear. Maybe that's partly where she learned it. Shields has, after all, five children: John, Ann, Catherine, Meg and Sarah. As she says, \"That's quite a lot.\" </p> <p>She started writing \"small poems\" when her children were little. One day she discovered she had enough for a book and was pleased when this was published by a local press. At the age of 40, her children now away from home - all except Sarah, \"I call her our love child, though I would never tell her that\" - she started to write her first novel, Small Ceremonies. And when this was accepted for publication, after \"three refusals\", she thought she'd try another. That's how she did it, she says: by increments. Gradually. And that's how she still writes, as she goes along imagining each part of her novel as a square and quilting it together. Someone once said, she tells me, that there is nothing constant in this life except gradualism. \"I think that's right. I never thought of myself as a writer. And then I was, almost by accident.\" </p> <p>For 20 years she was a wife and mother, and always a good friend - she has 12 best friends. Just as for the 20 years before that she was a good daughter, compliant, because that's what you did in those days if you were a good girl - \"even when you knew it was ridiculous\". If you were clever, you acted dumb, \"particularly if you were a blonde\". You talked about the holiness of the body, and kept yourself intact. You married in your early 20s - in her 22nd year she went to a wedding every week. \"It was part of a progression.\" And you had children. It sometimes seemed, she says, that she was an observer in her own life. Things were happening outside her world - the civil-rights movement, assassinations, the Vietnam war - and she was reading about them in Newsweek. She describes herself at this time as a \"very unreflective person\". \"I have become a very reflective person.\" Something must have thrown the switch, woken her up to her own life. Or maybe it was on all along, but she was too busy - there were so many demands. She wasn't frustrated, she says. She felt she had a very reasonable life. \"I have never, for one second, wanted to be a man.\" And it wasn't as though there was a burning desire to write. \"I never thought about it at all. I was taking French lessons... If anything, I felt guilty about having such an easy time.\" Are there people who go through life having an easy time, I asked her. \"No one gets through this unruffled,\" she says. \"I know that.\" </p> <p>A reviewer once wrote of one of her books that Shields \"doesn't do sadness very well\". Isn't that offensive, Shields says; and she doesn't mean the sentiment, she means the gracelessness of the remark. The review continued: \"Faced with tragedy she tends to bow out.\" And there may even be some accuracy in this. Shields would acknowledge that she has an interest in goodness, \"in why people seek to be good\", that on balance she prefers happy endings to sad ones. She has a friend who's always teasing her: \"All you want is for all your children to be happy all the time.\" And this is probably true of her characters, too. </p> <p>She tells me a story about an occasion, when her children were young, when she opened the fridge door and a heavy bottle of lemonade fell on her foot, smashing her toe. She tried to be brave, but it hurt so much that all she could do was cry. \"And there they all were, standing around me like little flowers, and I thought, 'I could crush them all with this letting go.' But I couldn't be brave.\" And maybe there is a sense of denial in all this, a desire to retreat into cosy domesticity. To put everything to rights by being brave. To trust to the humdrum, the habitual, the ordinary. The world in which the bottle never falls from the sky. And all that can be said is that it would be a great trick, if it could be pulled off. </p> <p> It is just over one year ago that she was standing in front of her mirror, dressing, when she noticed that one of her breasts was disfigured. She knew immediately, she says, that it was cancer; it turned out to be \"very aggressive\". Within days she had had a mastectomy. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment lasted until July. </p> <p>Cancer is ordinary, no question. But its effect on a life is far from ordinary; it blasts everything ordinary apart. You have to relearn the ordinary, if you have time. \"That innocence,\" she says, \"of believing that nothing will ever happen to you.\" I know this, too, because, like her, I've sat and listened to the diagnosis. Because of this common ground, we can swap stories. \"Cancer is a lot to have in common,\" she says. The letters. \"The ones I really object to are the ones where they say 'I am putting you on my prayer list.' There I draw the line,\" she says. What she calls \"becoming a funny-looking person\". \"In a way that's the hardest part for me, losing my hair, my eyebrows. I've always looked so ordinary.\" The shock of it, counting the length of the gaps in between the crying... 24 hours, 48 hours. Now she can't recall the last time she cried about it. The one comfort: at least it is me and not my daughters. And then the awful realisation - that cancer absolves you from nothing, protects you from nothing. She has accepted that her life will have a different shape now from the one she once imagined: \"A different shape and probably shorter.\" </p> <p>She has continued writing. A book of short stories is published this week, Dressing Up For The Carnival, and her biography of Jane Austen comes out next year. It's quite interesting, she says, that it was always assumed that Austen died of tuberculosis, but she has recently been rediagnosed as dying from cancer, a lymphoma. She was 41. </p> <p>Shields would like to write another novel. \"That would be nice.\" But not about illness, she says. \"Probably not.\" I had assumed that most of the stories in Dressing Up For The Carnival were written after she knew she had cancer - there is something dark, questing, at the core of each one - but this is not the case. Only three of them were written after the diagnosis. \"I needed something to occupy me.\" </p> <p>I was thinking of what she said about writing, about how you patch a book together and how it is only at the end that you stand back and can see it as a whole. Of course, it is her metaphor for living. And the question is, as always, how do you know when it is complete? </p> <p>Her daughter, her little one, Sarah - her favourite, I suspect, though it's not my place to say - once asked her how you know when you are grown up. Back then, Shields says, she wasn't quite sure how to answer her. \"I was a rather pious mother when I was young.\" But now she thinks she would say, \"Life begins later than you think.\" </p>",

Why are we curious about other people, she asks. Are we curious enough about our own lives? Shields is a feminist, and has been all her life, though she gave this sensibility a name only after reading Betty Friedan in the 70s. When she started writing, she wanted specifically to write about women, family loyalties, \"people like me\": subject matter that seems conservative. Even she was afraid it was dull. \"I didn't think there would be an audience outside women's magazines.\" But her interest in structure would always mark her as unusual. Happenstance, her third novel, was the dissection of a marriage told from both points of view - first one, then the other. Mary Swann examines the life of a murdered poetess from the perspectives of four individuals, each of whom are obsessed by her. In Larry's Party, her last novel, and a book about a man, the structure mimics the convoluted workings of Larry's thought. The Stone Diaries is the biography of a woman who slowly writes herself out of her own life. And so on. It's not that she has an agenda, she says. \"It's just that clearly, if you write a few books, you are going to write about the things that concern you deeply, and perhaps even more deeply than you'd like to confess to. For me, I object to the casual dismissal of women that I so often see.\" Childhood is built for happiness, and yet there is almost always something ineradicably sad about it. For Shields, I think, it was her parents' silence. Though they were, she says, the best parents they were able to be, they didn't talk to their children, and for Shields - who is a wonderful listener, who seems scarcely to want to talk herself if she can listen - this must have been so lonely. Anyway, she is married to someone, Don, \"43 years this summer\", who loves to talk. \"He likes nothing more than a table full of people, all talking.\" Shields was born in Chicago 64 years ago, in the pretty suburb of Oakland. She was the third child. Her brother and sister are twins - which could have been the root of the loneliness. But no, she says, she never felt excluded. \"I was everyone's little darling.\" Her mother, Ines, of Swedish descent and from whom she must inherit her golden hair, used to tell her that she was an accident. \"She turned it into a blessing, so I never minded. But I remember reading how Nancy Friday's life was ruined by her mother telling her that same thing, and I thought, 'Oh, it all depends on how it's said.'\" Life was ordered. A prairie-style house, four rooms up, four rooms down. Church every Sunday. Family meals in the evenings, when her father would serve and carve. \"I think he liked that role. Apart from that, I didn't know him very well. I don't think we ever had a real conversation.\" The thing about children, she says, is that they are not very interested in childhood, they take it for granted. Of course, there are things that you know as a child that stay with you always. \"The way that children have of really knowing the surface of their lives. I could put my hand now on a particular square of linoleum in our kitchen and know exactly how it felt.\" She, too, plays that game at night, when unable to sleep, of revisiting every room of her childhood home, and then every cupboard and every drawer. But so much is lost, she says, or goes unexamined. As a child, she relished her mother's vast family of seven siblings. \"All dead now.\" (Her mother was the youngest. Was she, perhaps, the accident?) She accepted the fact that her father was alone in the world, that his family was a sort of blank. \"All I know about my father's mother is something my mother once told me. That her name was Pearce and that she was 'Proud to be a Pearce'.\" What should be inferred from this? That the mother-in- law thought her not good enough to marry her son. Not that anything would ever be said. \"Ours was a quiet house, reserved . . . I do not come from a storytelling family.\" Details. Uncle Harry, her mother's brother, who lost a leg in the first world war and whose mother could never be told. \"I've always wondered what sort of woman she was that she could not bear that news.\" The terrible nightmares she had when she was 10 about a child murder in a Chicago park. \"It's a problem what you tell children, how much you protect them. It's how you present it, I suppose.\" No chance of protection here, with all the mothers talking, huddled in groups, full of whispers and anecdote. Later, Shields would turn this into a short story. \"The only real violence of my childhood.\" The violence of the war impinged upon her as a child, but as an inconvenience more than a reality. She was six when it began and nine when it ended; the surprise in that, she says, is that it seemed so very long at the time. She is famous in her family for declaring when the war ended: \"Good. There will be no more news.\" To the child, the war was an interruption of life, not life itself. \"We didn't even know where Germany was.\" There were no nightmares about this enemy. This killing was more of a game. At school, on the wall hung a huge poster of a man swinging a sword over the heads of some \"Japs\", and every time someone got 100% marks, the sword would chop through another body. In the schoolyard, there were \"scrap drives\". \"And, as you jumped on the tin can, you shouted, 'Kill that Jap'.\" Shields's most potent memory of this time is of her mother on VJ Day running out on to the porch, a carving fork held aloft - because, naturally, she was in the middle of cooking - shouting \"un-con-di-tio-nal surr-en-der\", with a break after every syllable, so that the words rolled like thunder. It was so unlike her, Shields says. Shields would never write about war, \"would never be interested to write about it,\" and it's true that not even in The Stone Diaries, which spans most of the last century, does it make an appearance, apart from \"exterior little curls\". This is not simply because it is a male subject, though that, too. \"The modelling of war is very male. Women don't write a great deal about war.\" Certainly, there is a level at which this is a version of the feminist his/story, her/story - history is male, made by men and related by men. But it is also, for Shields, a matter of taste, of sensibility. For her, it's as if life is a magnet, constantly attaching random bits and pieces to itself. What she has is that extraordinary gift of seeming to find everything interesting, while lavishing the same democratic care on every detail demanding her attention - I hesitate to say - like a good mother. But maybe it is the same kind of nurturing, this evenhandedness, this sympathetic ear. Maybe that's partly where she learned it. Shields has, after all, five children: John, Ann, Catherine, Meg and Sarah. As she says, \"That's quite a lot.\" She started writing \"small poems\" when her children were little. One day she discovered she had enough for a book and was pleased when this was published by a local press. At the age of 40, her children now away from home - all except Sarah, \"I call her our love child, though I would never tell her that\" - she started to write her first novel, Small Ceremonies. And when this was accepted for publication, after \"three refusals\", she thought she'd try another. That's how she did it, she says: by increments. Gradually. And that's how she still writes, as she goes along imagining each part of her novel as a square and quilting it together. Someone once said, she tells me, that there is nothing constant in this life except gradualism. \"I think that's right. I never thought of myself as a writer. And then I was, almost by accident.\" For 20 years she was a wife and mother, and always a good friend - she has 12 best friends. Just as for the 20 years before that she was a good daughter, compliant, because that's what you did in those days if you were a good girl - \"even when you knew it was ridiculous\". If you were clever, you acted dumb, \"particularly if you were a blonde\". You talked about the holiness of the body, and kept yourself intact. You married in your early 20s - in her 22nd year she went to a wedding every week. \"It was part of a progression.\" And you had children. It sometimes seemed, she says, that she was an observer in her own life. Things were happening outside her world - the civil-rights movement, assassinations, the Vietnam war - and she was reading about them in Newsweek. She describes herself at this time as a \"very unreflective person\". \"I have become a very reflective person.\" Something must have thrown the switch, woken her up to her own life. Or maybe it was on all along, but she was too busy - there were so many demands. She wasn't frustrated, she says. She felt she had a very reasonable life. \"I have never, for one second, wanted to be a man.\" And it wasn't as though there was a burning desire to write. \"I never thought about it at all. I was taking French lessons... If anything, I felt guilty about having such an easy time.\" Are there people who go through life having an easy time, I asked her. \"No one gets through this unruffled,\" she says. \"I know that.\" A reviewer once wrote of one of her books that Shields \"doesn't do sadness very well\". Isn't that offensive, Shields says; and she doesn't mean the sentiment, she means the gracelessness of the remark. The review continued: \"Faced with tragedy she tends to bow out.\" And there may even be some accuracy in this. Shields would acknowledge that she has an interest in goodness, \"in why people seek to be good\", that on balance she prefers happy endings to sad ones. She has a friend who's always teasing her: \"All you want is for all your children to be happy all the time.\" And this is probably true of her characters, too. She tells me a story about an occasion, when her children were young, when she opened the fridge door and a heavy bottle of lemonade fell on her foot, smashing her toe. She tried to be brave, but it hurt so much that all she could do was cry. \"And there they all were, standing around me like little flowers, and I thought, 'I could crush them all with this letting go.' But I couldn't be brave.\" And maybe there is a sense of denial in all this, a desire to retreat into cosy domesticity. To put everything to rights by being brave. To trust to the humdrum, the habitual, the ordinary. The world in which the bottle never falls from the sky. And all that can be said is that it would be a great trick, if it could be pulled off. It is just over one year ago that she was standing in front of her mirror, dressing, when she noticed that one of her breasts was disfigured. She knew immediately, she says, that it was cancer; it turned out to be \"very aggressive\". Within days she had had a mastectomy. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment lasted until July. Cancer is ordinary, no question. But its effect on a life is far from ordinary; it blasts everything ordinary apart. You have to relearn the ordinary, if you have time. \"That innocence,\" she says, \"of believing that nothing will ever happen to you.\" I know this, too, because, like her, I've sat and listened to the diagnosis. Because of this common ground, we can swap stories. \"Cancer is a lot to have in common,\" she says. The letters. \"The ones I really object to are the ones where they say 'I am putting you on my prayer list.' There I draw the line,\" she says. What she calls \"becoming a funny-looking person\". \"In a way that's the hardest part for me, losing my hair, my eyebrows. I've always looked so ordinary.\" The shock of it, counting the length of the gaps in between the crying... 24 hours, 48 hours. Now she can't recall the last time she cried about it. The one comfort: at least it is me and not my daughters. And then the awful realisation - that cancer absolves you from nothing, protects you from nothing. She has accepted that her life will have a different shape now from the one she once imagined: \"A different shape and probably shorter.\" She has continued writing. A book of short stories is published this week, Dressing Up For The Carnival, and her biography of Jane Austen comes out next year. It's quite interesting, she says, that it was always assumed that Austen died of tuberculosis, but she has recently been rediagnosed as dying from cancer, a lymphoma. She was 41. Shields would like to write another novel. \"That would be nice.\" But not about illness, she says. \"Probably not.\" I had assumed that most of the stories in Dressing Up For The Carnival were written after she knew she had cancer - there is something dark, questing, at the core of each one - but this is not the case. Only three of them were written after the diagnosis. \"I needed something to occupy me.\" I was thinking of what she said about writing, about how you patch a book together and how it is only at the end that you stand back and can see it as a whole. Of course, it is her metaphor for living. And the question is, as always, how do you know when it is complete? Her daughter, her little one, Sarah - her favourite, I suspect, though it's not my place to say - once asked her how you know when you are grown up. Back then, Shields says, she wasn't quite sure how to answer her. \"I was a rather pious mother when I was young.\" But now she thinks she would say, \"Life begins later than you think.\"",

He said: \"I believe the sensationalism of reporting in some papers may have attracted the kind of people we don't want in Telford.\" For West Mercia police the links being made between the deaths of the McGowans and the Stephen Lawrence case are highly uncomfortable. In a new statement yesterday the force attempted to rebut charges they had not taken the investigation seriously. \"We have carried out inquiries into far right groups who were referred to by family and friends of Erroll McGowan. The results of those inquiries indicate that no such group is active in the Telford area. \"We have investigated allegations of past harassment on Erroll McGowan. Six people were interviewed in connection and a file presented to the crown prosecution service. They decided there was insufficient evidence to charge any individuals with racial harassment or in connection with Erroll's death.\" A review by a West Midlands detective superintendent into the investigation into Erroll's death had taken place in July 1999 and lasted 10 days. An internal investigation of the handling of both cases is now being undertaken by a Det Supt Mel Shore. West Mercia said close liaison with family members had been a \"top priority\". But Clifton McGowan said last night: \"It was more a PR exercise to make them look good. They didn't actually tell us anything. They were treating us worse than five-year-old children. I wish now we had recorded some of these conversations.\" A spokesman for the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight said Shropshire had high levels of racism, but one of the lowest levels of fascist activity in England. Icyline McGowan added: \"I see what's happening and I am hurt. I would like really the truth to be known, because I believe they didn't do what the police said they did.\"",

I'm not arguing for the introduction of office uniforms - the colour and style of a beautiful suit should, clearly, be as individual as the wearer - but a professional appearance nevertheless speaks volumes about the attitude of an individual and their company.

Take a look at today's high-rollers in commerce: Branson's in jumpers; Evans is in baseball caps; Lynne Franks and Anita Roddick are in kaftans, for Christ's sakes! These free-wheeling tycoons know that cut-away collars and twin-sets constrict the flow of blood to their brain. If someone wears a suit in my workplace, it's because they're off to a bereavement party, or they've been busted - or worse. And it's not just us - it's a lot our clients too. They wear slacks, they wear fashion tops and they're saying: \"We're not Ms Brown and Mr Jenkins - we're Lisa and Dave. You can hang with us.\"</p> <p>But I agree with you on personal hygiene.

I don't doubt the professional abilities of the high-rollers you mention, but aren't they just the ones at the tip of the business iceberg? We all know that changes in our working environment are leading to a diminishing amount of personal contact, which can, unfortunately, fool us into thinking that since everything can be done with computers and telephones there's no need to look good any more.

It was to illustrate the laid-back modus operandi that's becoming prevalent not just in businesses like mine, but in more \"serious\" enterprises like Andersen's. This stampede towards the casual has less to do with our growing use of telecoms, and more to do with the growing antipathy towards the uniformity of groups of men in suits.

But I do believe my work to be an art, which couldn't survive without an ability to think creatively. To visit a bespoke tailor and choose the cloth, style and tiniest details of a suit is a very individual approach to the interpretation of one's ideas - a long way from a visit to the quartermaster's stores for a demob suit.</p> <p>The point I'm trying to make is this: I make clothes for some of the most charismatic and free-spirited individuals anyone could hope to meet - people who would never let themselves be constrained by a suit. Both of us know that jobsworths who gain pleasure from narrowmindedness will do so just as well in casual jackets and slacks as in the finest Savile Row suit. You say a suit is a workplace uniform, but isn't the alternative just to switch to the uniform of the slob? Greyness would remain. We're all motivated to succeed, whatever our business: don't you think that, if wearing a smart suit were detrimental to free though and fresh ideas, we'd have discovered this a little earlier?</p> <p>I'm confident that, if we have this same debate in 50 years, very little will have changed. In response to your chairman, who now slobs around the office, I'd just say this: I have just finished making two suits for a partner of a very successful London advertising firm.

The new rules, modelled on those for individual savings accounts, have been dubbed the \"CAT\" standards (it stands for Charges, Access and Terms). To win the official CAT-mark of quality, loans will have to meet a range of conditions covering clarity, fees and flexibility. But look beneath the glossy fur and this CAT is more than a little moth-eaten in places. </p> <p>Ministers announced this week that by summer next year, all the UK's mortgage lenders will be policed by the Financial Services Authority, the new \"super-watchdog,\" which will be a given a range of powers to punish firms that break the rules. At the moment, lenders are regulated by a voluntary code of practice regarded by many as pretty toothless. </p> <p>This change is clearly good news for consumers, as is the announcement that the FSA will regulate mortgage advertising and will insist that the information lenders give about their loans is clear, comprehensive and not misleading. </p> <p>But where the government has royally blown it, say critics, is in failing to tackle two of the issues that have caused most concern: the poor quality and sometimes downright dodgy mortgage advice given by some salespeople that can leave borrowers trapped in the wrong deals, and the problem of rogue mortgage advisers, who are able to set themselves up in business without any qualifications or training, and go about their business unchecked. </p> <p>For reasons no one seems able to fathom, ministers have decided not to regulate the mortgage advice on which millions of people rely to help them find the home loan that's best for them. In other words, the basic loan information you are provided will probably be pretty sound but there will be no rules governing the quality of the advice you get. </p> <p>With more than 4,000 different products to choose from, all with different bells and whistles, mortgages are an area where home-buyers rely heavily on decent advice. Yet all too often it seems they don't get it. One example the Consumers' Association gives is the current scandal over mis-sold endowments, which it says has partly been caused by mortgage advisers falsely claiming that endowment mortgages are more flexible than repayment loans. </p> <p>Even the FSA's own consumer panel is up in arms. It says the new regime will leave consumers \"confused and unprotected against poor-quality advice\". </p> <p>Equally controversial is the government's decision not to bring thousands of mortgage brokers under the umbrella of the new regime. Many of these people are already policed by the FSA because they also sell regulated products such as personal pensions, but an estimated 10,000 are not and therefore fall outside the new system. </p> <p>While the new regulatory system won't be in place for another 18 months, you will be able to buy a CAT-marked mortgage from April this year. The CAT standards (see panel) will be voluntary - lenders won't have to comply with them, but they will be required to tell borrowers whether or not a particular loan meets the standards and if not, why not. </p> <p>One of the best reasons for switching to a CAT-marked mortgage is that with these, lenders will be required to calculate people's interest payments on a daily rather than annual basis. Many UK lenders, including the Halifax, the UK's biggest, operate annual interest systems which result in people paying interest on debt they no longer owe. Having their interest calculated daily could save a typical borrower perhaps \u00a370 a year. However, this could be lost if unscrupulous lenders raise rates to compensate for loss of profit. </p> <p>Other CAT standards include a requirement that all fees must be disclosed. </p> <p>CAT-marked variable rate mortgages cannot impose any early redemption penalties, which means you can walk away at any time, while in the case of fixed-rate and capped mortgages, there must be no redemption penalties after the end of the fixed/capped period. </p> <p> Where the CAT standards come unstuck is with the requirement that on variable rate mortgages, the interest rate you pay must be no higher than 2% above the Bank of England base rate. </p> <p>In the current low interest rate environment this will provide very little benefit to homeowners because it is such a wide margin. </p> <p>Come April, if the base rate is still 5.75%, it means the lender won't be able to charge you more than 7.75%. As Patrick Bunton at mortgage broker London &amp; Country puts it: \"There's not a single high street lender with a standard variable rate as high as that at the moment. It's certainly not putting them under any pressure to reduce rates.\" </p> <p>But the biggest problem with the CAT standards is that they exclude discounted variable rate mortgages and cashback deals. Discounted rate deals are hugely popular - latest figures from mortgage companies indicate they account for around 50%-60% of all new loans being taken out. Demand for them is likely to increase even further when the anticipated interest rate cuts arrive later this year or early next. Yet if you want a CAT-marked discounted deal, you won't be able to buy one. </p> <p>So, are there many deals currently on the market that already meet all the CAT standards? Probably very few, reckons Mr Bunton. Many are ruled out because the interest is not calculated daily. With a lot of the fixed-rate and capped deals on the market, the arrangement fee is higher than the maximum \u00a3150 that can be imposed (in many cases the fee is around \u00a3200-\u00a3300), or the way the redemption penalties are structured doesn't meet the CAT requirements. </p> <p>However, several lenders have come out and said they meet all or virtually all of the standards. Virgin Direct says its Virgin One account - an all-in-one account combining a current account and a mortgage - meets all the standards. Interest is calculated daily and the rate for a typical borrower is 1.2% above base rate. Moreover, there is no arrangement fee, no separate charge for mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance and no redemption penalties at any time. </p> <p>Co-operative Insurance Society this week launched what it described as a \"CAT-friendly\" deal. It is a repayment mortgage with a variable rate of 6.7% and a 1% discount for new borrowers in the first year. Interest is calculated daily, it is free of redemption penalties and there is no arrangement fee or mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance to pay.</p>",

In the current low interest rate environment this will provide very little benefit to homeowners because it is such a wide margin. Come April, if the base rate is still 5.75%, it means the lender won't be able to charge you more than 7.75%. As Patrick Bunton at mortgage broker London &amp; Country puts it: \"There's not a single high street lender with a standard variable rate as high as that at the moment. It's certainly not putting them under any pressure to reduce rates.\" But the biggest problem with the CAT standards is that they exclude discounted variable rate mortgages and cashback deals. Discounted rate deals are hugely popular - latest figures from mortgage companies indicate they account for around 50%-60% of all new loans being taken out. Demand for them is likely to increase even further when the anticipated interest rate cuts arrive later this year or early next. Yet if you want a CAT-marked discounted deal, you won't be able to buy one. So, are there many deals currently on the market that already meet all the CAT standards? Probably very few, reckons Mr Bunton. Many are ruled out because the interest is not calculated daily. With a lot of the fixed-rate and capped deals on the market, the arrangement fee is higher than the maximum \u00a3150 that can be imposed (in many cases the fee is around \u00a3200-\u00a3300), or the way the redemption penalties are structured doesn't meet the CAT requirements. However, several lenders have come out and said they meet all or virtually all of the standards. Virgin Direct says its Virgin One account - an all-in-one account combining a current account and a mortgage - meets all the standards. Interest is calculated daily and the rate for a typical borrower is 1.2% above base rate. Moreover, there is no arrangement fee, no separate charge for mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance and no redemption penalties at any time. Co-operative Insurance Society this week launched what it described as a \"CAT-friendly\" deal. It is a repayment mortgage with a variable rate of 6.7% and a 1% discount for new borrowers in the first year. Interest is calculated daily, it is free of redemption penalties and there is no arrangement fee or mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance to pay.",

      "body": "<p>When supermarket giant Sainsbury's installed Sir Peter Davis as its new chief executive on an annual salary of \u00a31.25m, it was only after \"long and protracted negotiations\". Manchester United captain Roy Keane has just signed a new contract for a staggering \u00a350,000 a week, but, again, this was only after three months of trading and a threat to leave the club. </p> <p>Bargaining may have paid off for them, but can it work for you? As a new graduate with no track record, it won't be easy - but don't let that deter you. </p> <p>\"Of course it helps if you have some industry experience,\" says Jeremy Langley of The Graduate Recruitment Company. \"But graduates have more leeway than they think and they shouldn't approach their first job thinking I can't negotiate, I'm just a graduate.\" </p> <p>Langley divides the graduate job market into two categories. \"There's the one that everybody talks about - the blue chip graduate training schemes which account for the top 20,000-30,000 graduates. And the other category - those graduates remaining, which when you consider that 350,000-400,000 leave higher education with a degree every year, represents a huge percentage of the total market. </p> <p>\"It's this category - graduates applying to small and medium-sized firms - where you'll find more scope for negotiating salaries. Don't expect such flexibility from the large companies, which tend to set fixed salary bands for their graduates.\" </p> <p>When it comes to talking money, a bit of preparation goes a long way. \"Before negotiating, set your benchmark,\" suggests Langley. \"But be realistic. The average salary for a graduate is around \u00a316,000 so you can use that as a basis.\" </p> <p>Rod Oakland, deputy director of the University of Birmingham careers centre agrees: \"You'll need to present a strong, well-argued case and that means doing some research first.\" </p> <p>Most university careers centres can provide data on average starting salaries in different sectors and for different degree subjects. \"Whatever you do, don't just pluck a figure out of the air,\" warns Oakland. </p> <p>If you have relevant industry experience through a sandwich course, use it. \"You should expect to be remunerated accordingly, particularly if you have been working for a competitor,\" says Langley. </p> <p>Avoid pricing yourself out of a job. John, a business development manager from London, did just that when he went for an interview as a marketing assistant. \"I think it was part naivety and part arrogance. I had a mate in the City who had just started on \u00a322,000 plus perks. So I thought I'd push it. I asked for \u00a319,000 but they only wanted to pay \u00a315,000. </p> <p>\"I thought things had gone well and I really expected them to come back to me with a higher offer. But they didn't and when I phoned they said they liked me but couldn't come close to matching what I was after.\" </p> <p>As a top rate graduate, you can command an impressive starting salary in the City. But here, as with other large firms, graduate salaries are set. \"If we really want someone, we might offer a sign-on bonus,\" explains an HR manager from a leading retail bank, \"but other than that it's the same salary for any graduate with any degree.\" Still, \u00a32,000 upfront is not to be sneezed at. </p> <p>Back to the table and what to do next. A common ploy is to fabricate a counter offer. Curly Moloney of Moloney Search warns: \"You have to be very careful. As far as I'm concerned it's best to be honest.\" </p> <p>According to Moloney, most companies research their markets and have a good idea of what competitors are paying. \"It will look quite odd if you say you've been offered a much higher salary for a similar job.\" She adds: \"If you want to negotiate the salary, you should be open about it from the start. It will look very bad if you spring it on an employer at the last minute if all along you said money is not an issue.\" </p> <p>If you are thinking of going down the \"better offer\" route, take heed. Business communities can be smaller than you think. People know each other - and they talk. </p> <p>If all else fails, start thinking about your future prospects. Many employers might not be able to move far on salary but they might agree to a training allowance, say \u00a31,500. This will be easier for your boss to justify to his or her superiors. </p> <p>And it will do wonders for that crucial track record.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When supermarket giant Sainsbury's installed Sir Peter Davis as its new chief executive on an annual salary of \u00a31.25m, it was only after \"long and protracted negotiations\". Manchester United captain Roy Keane has just signed a new contract for a staggering \u00a350,000 a week, but, again, this was only after three months of trading and a threat to leave the club. Bargaining may have paid off for them, but can it work for you? As a new graduate with no track record, it won't be easy - but don't let that deter you. \"Of course it helps if you have some industry experience,\" says Jeremy Langley of The Graduate Recruitment Company. \"But graduates have more leeway than they think and they shouldn't approach their first job thinking I can't negotiate, I'm just a graduate.\" Langley divides the graduate job market into two categories. \"There's the one that everybody talks about - the blue chip graduate training schemes which account for the top 20,000-30,000 graduates. And the other category - those graduates remaining, which when you consider that 350,000-400,000 leave higher education with a degree every year, represents a huge percentage of the total market. \"It's this category - graduates applying to small and medium-sized firms - where you'll find more scope for negotiating salaries. Don't expect such flexibility from the large companies, which tend to set fixed salary bands for their graduates.\" When it comes to talking money, a bit of preparation goes a long way. \"Before negotiating, set your benchmark,\" suggests Langley. \"But be realistic. The average salary for a graduate is around \u00a316,000 so you can use that as a basis.\" Rod Oakland, deputy director of the University of Birmingham careers centre agrees: \"You'll need to present a strong, well-argued case and that means doing some research first.\" Most university careers centres can provide data on average starting salaries in different sectors and for different degree subjects. \"Whatever you do, don't just pluck a figure out of the air,\" warns Oakland. If you have relevant industry experience through a sandwich course, use it. \"You should expect to be remunerated accordingly, particularly if you have been working for a competitor,\" says Langley. Avoid pricing yourself out of a job. John, a business development manager from London, did just that when he went for an interview as a marketing assistant. \"I think it was part naivety and part arrogance. I had a mate in the City who had just started on \u00a322,000 plus perks. So I thought I'd push it. I asked for \u00a319,000 but they only wanted to pay \u00a315,000. \"I thought things had gone well and I really expected them to come back to me with a higher offer. But they didn't and when I phoned they said they liked me but couldn't come close to matching what I was after.\" As a top rate graduate, you can command an impressive starting salary in the City. But here, as with other large firms, graduate salaries are set. \"If we really want someone, we might offer a sign-on bonus,\" explains an HR manager from a leading retail bank, \"but other than that it's the same salary for any graduate with any degree.\" Still, \u00a32,000 upfront is not to be sneezed at. Back to the table and what to do next. A common ploy is to fabricate a counter offer. Curly Moloney of Moloney Search warns: \"You have to be very careful. As far as I'm concerned it's best to be honest.\" According to Moloney, most companies research their markets and have a good idea of what competitors are paying. \"It will look quite odd if you say you've been offered a much higher salary for a similar job.\" She adds: \"If you want to negotiate the salary, you should be open about it from the start. It will look very bad if you spring it on an employer at the last minute if all along you said money is not an issue.\" If you are thinking of going down the \"better offer\" route, take heed. Business communities can be smaller than you think. People know each other - and they talk. If all else fails, start thinking about your future prospects. Many employers might not be able to move far on salary but they might agree to a training allowance, say \u00a31,500. This will be easier for your boss to justify to his or her superiors. And it will do wonders for that crucial track record.",

      "bodyText": "The Russian authorities have arrested a journalist who worked to expose the suffering wrought by the Chechnya war, accusing him of joining the guerrillas in the Caucasus. The arrest came as the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, yesterday stoked the fires of a new Russian militarism and nationalism by lashing out at \"all sorts of scum\" who were bent on tearing Russia to pieces and bringing it to its knees. \"Throughout the entire history of our country, it has always been that it only takes Russia to become weaker for all sorts of scum to pop up and try to beat our country, tear it to pieces, and force it to its knees,\" Mr Putin said. \"No one has ever succeeded, nor will they ever, because simple Russian people have always stood in the way.\" Russian intelligence sources yesterday told the Interfax news agency that Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for the US-funded Radio Liberty who had been missing for 12 days, had been arrested in Chechnya and faced charges of belonging to an illegal armed group. Russian RTR state television confirmed the report, quoting Oleg Aksyonov, an interior ministry spokesman, as saying Mr Babitsky was being held in Chechnya because he lacked the proper military accreditation to work in the war zone. Another leading Moscow journalist, Aleksandr Khinshteyn, who specialises in investigating sleaze in the government, has gone into hiding to avoid being taken to a psychiatric clinic by the police, who want him detained for alleged driving licence offences. A couple of hundred journalists and human rights activists demonstrated yesterday outside the police ministry in Moscow to protest against the hounding of Mr Khinshteyn, an investigative television and newspaper reporter. The press crackdown by forces under the former KGB agent Mr Putin, and the reversion to the old Soviet practice of dispatching dissident voices to psychiatric clinics, are sending ripples of fear through Moscow's independent media. \"Today they want to send us to the asylum, tomorrow they'll be closing down the newspapers,\" said Pavel Gusev, the editor of Moscow's bestselling newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, said. Mr Babitsky has courted great personal risk by spending weeks under Russian bombardment in Grozny and elsewhere in Chechnya during the four-month conflict. He is also a veteran of the past Chechen war of 1994-96. On Wednesday, Sergey Yastrzhembsky, the Russian spokesman on Chechnya, said that Mr Babitsky's disappearance proved that the Russian authorities could not guarantee the safety of journalists working in Chechnya. Oleg Panfilov, head of the Glasnost Fund monitoring media freedom, disclosed yesterday that Mr Babitsky was being held by Russian troops in a cellar in Urus-Martan, south of Grozny. \"The generals will go to any lengths to prevent journalists from seeing the present war and its consequences,\" he said. \"The detention is absolutely illegal.\" The reporter could be jailed for five years if found guilty of joining the Chechen guerrillas. Earlier this week Vladimir Kozin, a foreign ministry official, urged \"more decisive and concrete action to create an information blockade for western journalists undertaking subversive work on Chechnya territory\". The World Association of Newspapers has just written to Mr Putin to point out that the killing of 11 journalists last year in Russia made the country the most dangerous place in Europe for the media. \"We remain seriously concerned at the appalling level of danger facing members of the press. Such violence fosters a climate of fear that inhibits journalistic investigation and promotes self-censorship,\" the letter said. \"Independent journalists covering election campaigns reportedly remain at greatest risk.\" Mr Khinshteyn has repeatedly sought to investigate allegations of corruption made against Boris Berezovsky, the millionaire Kremlin insider, and his ally, Vladimir Rushailo, the interior minister.",

      "body": "<p>If you are one of the 1.35m people who bought an iMac in the past three months, congratulations, you've just joined a select group. You are also using an industry pariah. iMacs - all Macs for that matter - are second-class citizens when it comes to financial services on the internet. </p> <p>The latest example of this exclusion is the internet bank smile.co.uk - the first in the UK to offer a current account. Two months after its launch Smile is still inaccessible to Mac users because of a software problem. Surf to the bank's secure web site on your Mac and all you'll get is a blank page. Smile customer services say they \"are aware of the problem and are working to fix it\". But a little investigation reveals the glitch is just the tip of an iceberg. </p> <p>Smile's owner, The Co-op Bank, puts the blame on flaws in the Mac version of Java - an internet operating system specifically designed to run on any computer. It says it trusts only Java to ensure online banking is kept hidden from prying eyes.</p> <p>\"We are unapologetically Java-based because only Java offers the level of security we need,\" says Co-op spokesman David Smith. He says the bank knew Mac users would have a problem using the service before the system's launch, though the fact was conveniently ignored during the Smile advertising campaign. </p> <p>Smith claims Macs are at fault for the incompatibility. \"[The service] is aimed at people with up-to-date equipment who are very comfortable with the internet,\" says Smith. \"It's the Macs that need to be sorted out.\" </p> <p>But Mac experts say it is not a Mac problem at all but a Smile problem. \"Banks that claim [that Macs have] a security issue are talking nonsense,\" says Alex Sobosley, editor of MacFormat. Java was intended to create a single internet-wide standard for programming on the web. But Microsoft did not stick to the Java design standard when it wrote its version for Windows machines.</p> <p>Consequently Smile programmers were left with two different systems to cater for and Mac users have drawn the short straw. Meanwhile Windows users are enjoying Smile's 4.33% interest rate and free \u00a3500 overdraft in their droves. Some Mac users regard it as a form of computer apartheid. </p> <p>Smile is not the only example of Mac marginalisation. Two of the latest home-finance and accounting packages, Money 2000 from Microsoft and Intuit's Quicken, are not available to Mac users. The packages are designed to help you keep track of your daily credits and debits, connect to your bank account via the internet, gather mortgage information, manage investments, savings and bills, and even create a will. </p> <p>Money 2000 is written exclusively for Windows machines, while the Mac version of Quicken is not for sale to European customers - though it retails for $49.95 in the US. And forget about buying Quicken online. Intuit will supply the Mac package only to customers in Canada and the US. If you're a European with a Mac, you're simply not getting it. The reason for this bizarre situation eludes Intuit's UK support staff, who don't even know the Mac version exists. </p> <p>The main reason for this anti-Mac attitude is the financial cost of developing software for the proportionally small number of Mac owners - 1.6m in the UK, or one-in-10 of all personal computers. But some blame a deeper anti-Mac conspiracy. </p> <p>Industry insiders accuse software publishers of trying to eliminate Mac versions of software to cut costs. John Cormack, the creator of the popular computer game Quake, recently urged Mac owners not to buy the Windows version of the game and run it on a Mac using a Windows emulator, but rather to wait until the Mac version was released. Both versions were ready at the same time, but the Windows version went on sale first. Cormack said that if the publishers saw that the Mac version was not selling (because Mac users had bought the Windows version) they would pull the plug on any further Mac development. The same applies to the financial software industry. </p> <p>A case in point is Market Maker - an online share-trading package supplied by the CMC group in Hertfordshire. No Mac version is available because most of the company's existing customers use Windows PCs. Market Maker is the first system to give share prices in real-time and to perform transactions in seconds. Typical online share trading systems are email based, transactions can take anything from 30 seconds to 30 minutes, while new share prices are published every 10 to 20 minutes. </p> <p>If you're not a budding Gordon Gekko, the email system might suit you just fine, but there is another advantage in Market Maker.

      "bodyText": "If you are one of the 1.35m people who bought an iMac in the past three months, congratulations, you've just joined a select group. You are also using an industry pariah. iMacs - all Macs for that matter - are second-class citizens when it comes to financial services on the internet. The latest example of this exclusion is the internet bank smile.co.uk - the first in the UK to offer a current account. Two months after its launch Smile is still inaccessible to Mac users because of a software problem. Surf to the bank's secure web site on your Mac and all you'll get is a blank page. Smile customer services say they \"are aware of the problem and are working to fix it\". But a little investigation reveals the glitch is just the tip of an iceberg. Smile's owner, The Co-op Bank, puts the blame on flaws in the Mac version of Java - an internet operating system specifically designed to run on any computer. It says it trusts only Java to ensure online banking is kept hidden from prying eyes. \"We are unapologetically Java-based because only Java offers the level of security we need,\" says Co-op spokesman David Smith. He says the bank knew Mac users would have a problem using the service before the system's launch, though the fact was conveniently ignored during the Smile advertising campaign. Smith claims Macs are at fault for the incompatibility. \"[The service] is aimed at people with up-to-date equipment who are very comfortable with the internet,\" says Smith. \"It's the Macs that need to be sorted out.\" But Mac experts say it is not a Mac problem at all but a Smile problem. \"Banks that claim [that Macs have] a security issue are talking nonsense,\" says Alex Sobosley, editor of MacFormat. Java was intended to create a single internet-wide standard for programming on the web. But Microsoft did not stick to the Java design standard when it wrote its version for Windows machines. Consequently Smile programmers were left with two different systems to cater for and Mac users have drawn the short straw. Meanwhile Windows users are enjoying Smile's 4.33% interest rate and free \u00a3500 overdraft in their droves. Some Mac users regard it as a form of computer apartheid. Smile is not the only example of Mac marginalisation. Two of the latest home-finance and accounting packages, Money 2000 from Microsoft and Intuit's Quicken, are not available to Mac users. The packages are designed to help you keep track of your daily credits and debits, connect to your bank account via the internet, gather mortgage information, manage investments, savings and bills, and even create a will. Money 2000 is written exclusively for Windows machines, while the Mac version of Quicken is not for sale to European customers - though it retails for $49.95 in the US. And forget about buying Quicken online. Intuit will supply the Mac package only to customers in Canada and the US. If you're a European with a Mac, you're simply not getting it. The reason for this bizarre situation eludes Intuit's UK support staff, who don't even know the Mac version exists. The main reason for this anti-Mac attitude is the financial cost of developing software for the proportionally small number of Mac owners - 1.6m in the UK, or one-in-10 of all personal computers. But some blame a deeper anti-Mac conspiracy. Industry insiders accuse software publishers of trying to eliminate Mac versions of software to cut costs. John Cormack, the creator of the popular computer game Quake, recently urged Mac owners not to buy the Windows version of the game and run it on a Mac using a Windows emulator, but rather to wait until the Mac version was released. Both versions were ready at the same time, but the Windows version went on sale first. Cormack said that if the publishers saw that the Mac version was not selling (because Mac users had bought the Windows version) they would pull the plug on any further Mac development. The same applies to the financial software industry. A case in point is Market Maker - an online share-trading package supplied by the CMC group in Hertfordshire. No Mac version is available because most of the company's existing customers use Windows PCs. Market Maker is the first system to give share prices in real-time and to perform transactions in seconds. Typical online share trading systems are email based, transactions can take anything from 30 seconds to 30 minutes, while new share prices are published every 10 to 20 minutes. If you're not a budding Gordon Gekko, the email system might suit you just fine, but there is another advantage in Market Maker. CMC is pioneering a dealing service called Contracts for Difference, which effectively allows you to trade five times as many shares as you pay for. With as little as \u00a35,000 you could become a day-trader from your home. The service, launched on January 10, has already gathered hundreds of customers - all Windows users. But Andrew Palmer, CMC marketing manager, believes the Mac market is simply too small to be worth the development costs. Like the Quake players, one solution is to fork out for an emulator and fool the opposition into thinking you're using a Windows PC. But you'd be losing out on all fronts. There's the speed issue - programs run faster if they are written for the specific hardware. Worse still, not all software is compatible with the emulator and technical problems are a nightmare to sort out. Despite all this, I believe my own iMac was worth the cash, if only to stick two fingers up at the Gates empire. The Mac has survived similar crises before, and there is other software out there, albeit non-standard. But there are greater forces than my iMac at play, and if industry attitudes don't change soon we privileged few may soon become quirky has-beens. Smile",

He is on a dialysis machine and is having round the clock treatment - a transplant may be considered. As demonstrators gathered yesterday to protest about care at the Prince Philip hospital, it emerged that it has been at the centre of two recent police inquiries into patient deaths. A spokesman for Dyfed Powys police confirmed that one of the investigations has been concluded and an inquest is due to be held, while police are awaiting a crown prosecution service ruling on the second death. The two deaths, which occurred in June and October 1998, are said to be unconnected to one another or to the latest incident. Carmarthenshire NHS trust, which launched an immediate internal investigation into the kidney blunder, had intended to release its preliminary findings yesterday. But officials have now decided to wait the completion of a more detailed report from the two leading urologists appointed by the Royal College of Surgeons to carry out an independent inquiry. The trust is carrying out an audit of 400 recent operations at the hospital. Nurses there say they have complained about post-operative care in the urology department. Gwynedd hospital, in Bangor, north Wales, where Mr Roberts worked from 1983 to 1997, said it had no plans to carry out an audit of past operations similar to the one now taking place in Llanelli.

Llanelli MP Denzil Davies said he wanted the public to be given the results of the Royal College of Surgeons' independent investigation. \"All the evidence given to the inquiry and the conclusion should be made public so that people can maintain confidence in the hospital,\" he said.",

She would rather lose her car than lose her private healthcare policy. </p> <p>But retired administrator Marjorie Hemming, 71, cancelled her \u00a31,000-a-year policy with Prime Health after it failed to cover her for the treatment she wanted for glaucoma. Instead she obtained \"fantastic\" service at her local NHS hospital and says she will never again cough up for expensive private insurance. The recent flu epidemic will tempt many to consider going private. Even Tony Blair's dad was revealed this week to have taken out private health insurance. </p> <p>But while Ms Cokyll is evangelical about the benefits of her policy, the experience of Ms Hemming underlines how taking out a private policy may be no guarantee that your full needs will be met. </p> <p>A Jobs &amp; Money survey this week of monthly charges on budget plans - which may have extensive exclusions and high \"excesses\" - also reveals that while premiums are affordable for 30-50-year olds, they rise steeply for 70 year olds. Fully comprehensive policies that mirror everything available on the NHS can cost pensioners \u00a3400 per month or more. </p> <p>Buying a medical policy on price grounds alone, in the same way that people shop around for car insurance, makes little sense for most people, says David Worth, managing director of Medical Fees Insurance Agency (MFIA). \"Buying on price alone is where most people come to grief, finding later on that the policy is not as extensive as they believed. Look at stress-related illness. It's a serious problem, which the more expensive policies cover, but the cheaper ones don't. </p> <p>\"The public also have to understand that private medical insurance is designed for acute, curable conditions and can't cover chronic conditions. Often the public don't appreciate the difference\" Mr Worth says. </p> <p>Anybody considering buying a private medical policy should check the following items: </p> <p><strong> Excesses:</strong> The soaring cost of medical bills has prompted many insurers to introduce excesses on policies as a way to reduce premiums. The two most common excess levels are \u00a3100 and \u00a3250, ie: you pay the first \u00a3100 or \u00a3250 of the medical costs. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, a \u00a3100 excess tends to reduce the average premium by 10%, while a \u00a3250 excess cuts the cost by around 25%. Excesses are most common on policies sold to elderly people. One thing to look out for is whether the excess is per claim or per year. If you make two claims in one year you could end up paying \u00a3500 in fees on top of your premiums. And even though a \"per year\" excess is usually cheaper, it is not watertight; if your treatment occurs at a time when you your policy is up for renewal, you will end up paying the excess twice over, for the former and the new policy. </p> <p><strong> Exclusions</strong> </p> <p>It is near-impossible to find an individual medical insurance policy that will cover you for Aids, drug or alcohol addiction or self-inflicted injuries. Beyond that, each company will have its own list of excluded conditions. Gener ally, the more conditions excluded, the cheaper the policy, but the less use it will be. Employer-sponsored schemes tend to have fewer exclusions - some even include Aids - as it reduces the problem of \"selection\" for the insurance company. Selection is where people buy medical insurance policies knowing that they are at particular risk from a condition, whereas in an employer scheme, the risks of \"poor\" lives which result in high claims is cancelled out by the \"good\" lives. </p> <p><strong> Family policies:</strong> Buyers of private healthcare usually take out family policies, which cover children for little extra cost. But the cut-off ages for family policies can vary widely, with some policies stopping cover for children at 18, while others include them until 21. Some policies will even continue to cover children until the age of 25 if they remain in full-time education. </p> <p>Another item to look out for is if the policy will pay for a parent's bed when a child has been hospitalised. Some policies offer this benefit at no extra cost, while others exclude it, leaving the parent to pay \u00a350-\u00a3100 night bed fees. </p> <p><strong> Pre-existing conditions:</strong> This is one of the most contentious areas of private medical policies. Currently, insurers operate two different approaches; full medical disclosure or \"moratorium\" underwriting. Under full disclosure, the applicant has to complete an extensive medical questionnaire form before a policy will be granted, and in the case of older applicants, will have to attend a medical with a doctor approved by the insurer. </p> <p>Any pre-existing condition notified to the insurer may then be excluded from the future cover, so if you get it again, bad luck, you may have to go on the NHS. What's more, if you lie on the form and the insurer finds out, your policy is invalidated and the insurer could take even tougher action against you. </p> <p>The second approach is moratorium underwriting, where the applicant does not have to give any medical evidence about themselves at all. But under these policies you will be automatically disqualified for two years from any cover if you develop a condition you have had in the last five years. </p> <p><strong> Premium escalation and age bands:</strong> Despite huge and expensive advertising campaigns by the major companies such as Bupa and PPP, the number of people with private medical insurance was static or falling for most of the 90s. For every new buyer of a policy, another has fallen out because they can no longer afford the soaring cost of premiums. MFIA's Mr Worth says it is essential that buyers take a realistic view of how much the policy will cost over the years: \"Don't just look at the initial cost that is quoted, as the insurance companies rarely tell you what it's going to cost you in later years.\" Most policies operate 10-year age bands, with premiums leaping upwards as you get older and move into the next band. </p> <p>One way of controlling costs is to buy a fixed-price plan, such as Bupa's new plan in which you pay a little more now to ensure that your premiums will not rise for at least five years. </p> <p><strong> Employer schemes:</strong> </p> <p>For the \"selection\" reasons set out above, employer schemes are usually much cheaper than individually bought plans. However, these vary widely in quality. Many are free for certain categories of employee, but others oper ate by offering employees discounts on the premiums for a particular provider. If the discount is only 10-20% then the scheme may have little value over buying one individually through a broker. But other schemes offer more generous discounts, such as Ms Cokyll's BBC scheme, which gives members 46% off the standard Bupa price. </p> <p>If you are not as fortunate as Ms Cokyll and do not have an employer scheme - her last operation was at London's Wellington Hospital, where fees are some \u00a3525 a day before surgery - it is probably worth consulting a broker before buying an individual policy. The newly formed Association of Medical Insurance Intermediaries operates a freephone number, 0800-421216, to help you locate a local broker. </p>",

But other schemes offer more generous discounts, such as Ms Cokyll's BBC scheme, which gives members 46% off the standard Bupa price. If you are not as fortunate as Ms Cokyll and do not have an employer scheme - her last operation was at London's Wellington Hospital, where fees are some \u00a3525 a day before surgery - it is probably worth consulting a broker before buying an individual policy. The newly formed Association of Medical Insurance Intermediaries operates a freephone number, 0800-421216, to help you locate a local broker.",

The UN classifies Chechnya as the world's top danger spot, primarily because of the kidnapping risk, and does not permit expatriate staff to base themselves there or in Ingushetia. \"The north Caucasus is the only region in the world where every single major aid agency has been hit, either by murder, rape or kidnapping,\" one UN worker said.",

They might have succeeded in this devilish plan had the firemen not spotted black smoke billowing away in a different place. The children then gathered up stones and rocks, and started throwing them at the fire engine as the two officers were getting back into it. The officers were spared injury, but the engine is now covered with chips and dents. </p> <p>As it so happened, the fire had been a false alarm. There was no burning factory, just a bonfire of rubbish and old mattresses. But as sub-officer Declan Mullan of Mereway fire station told the Chronicle, \"It makes you wonder what would have happened if it was one of their families that had needed us. We're here to save lives and protect the public, and we shouldn't have to put up with this type of behaviour. If we get called out to the same place again, we've asked the police to attend so we can get on with the job and not have to worry that we're going to get hit by stones.\" </p> <p>The question that always seems to puzzle grown-ups is why children behave in this way. One day this week, I forgot to turn off the television after the breakfast news and found myself watching Kilroy on BBC1. The theme was juvenile vandalism and how to prevent it. There was the usual gathering of interested parties dug up by the programme's researchers - reformed young vandals (all claiming to have given up vandalising), virtuous young people who had never vandalised, victims of vandalism, voluntary youth workers, council officers and the like. The grown-ups divided along predictable lines - those of a certain age who thought that delinquent youngsters who smash windows and daub graffiti on walls should be given \"a bit o' that\" (ie, a good thrashing) by their parents, as they would have been in the old days, and those who thought that they ought to be talked to and, above all, listened to. </p> <p>Robert Kilroy-Silk, the programme's presenter, tried to find out from the reformed delinquents why they had spent so much time vandalising instead of engaging in more constructive pursuits. They said they had been plagued by boredom, that there had been nothing else to do, and that it gave them a buzz. Hadn't they cared about the misery they were causing? They hadn't thought about it, they said. They had just enjoyed the excitement of smashing things and then running away, imagining that they were being chased. Nobody was chasing them, of course. There were no police on the beat. It had been a pretty safe kind of thrill. </p> <p>The adults in the listening category complained about the absence in deprived areas of such things as swimming pools, ice rinks and youth centres that would keep children entertained. They blamed the government. They blamed local councils. They blamed parents who push children into the streets just to get them out of the house. When the youngsters were asked what they would say to adults who were willing to listen to them, they fell curiously silent. The viewer might have been left with the impression that the only solution to the problem was fierce disciplinary measures, especially as the proponents of the tough approach were always greeted with loud applause. </p> <p> The truth is that the hardliners are in tune with the spirit of the times. In France, where violence in schools is perceived as a major problem, \"zero tolerance\" is now the prevailing principle. Schools aren't allowed to beat children, but they expel them in droves. Police get called in and charge them with crimes - three pupils at one school are currently being investigated for extortion and attempted murder after throwing downstairs a boy called Pablo when he refused to do their Spanish homework, despite daily bribes of five francs and a bar of chocolate. </p> <p>In the US, it's the same. \"Permissive liberalism\" is under fierce attack even by a traditionally liberal magazine such as the New Republic. Occasionally, \"zero tolerance\" goes too far, says the magazine, as when a schoolboy in Georgia was suspended for giving his French teacher a bottle of vintage wine for Christmas.

Presumably Radio 3 keeps reviving the iconic 40s Home Service discussion programme to prove that it isn't dumbing down. Having to borrow the gravitas of another era rather disproves it. </p> <p>I'm not sure whether The Brains Trust's subjects or speakers are more maddening. The brains are billed as those of leading international intellectuals in science, history, theology and the arts. Yet hearing the first programme's cast last week (Theodore Zeldin, Jonathan Glover, Angela Tilbury and Ian Stewart), similarities were more apparent than differences. All were liberal humanists, aged within roughly 15 years of each other. </p> <p>Where were the young people - or are grey hairs required to become a leading intellectual? In that case, where were the old voices? Why was there no non-western perspective? For a really challenging debate, you must surely pit fresh perspectives against the known. Otherwise the bourgeoisie is chattering to itself. </p> <p>The listeners' questions are easy to parody. There's always a loopy romantic one: in the 40s, \"what are the most beautiful words in the English language?\"; last week \"what is hope?\" But mostly they occupy a well demarcated religio-moral terrain, asking whether fighting tyranny inevitably turns you into a tyrant, or why certain kinds of work are so little valued. </p> <p>These are weighty matters but, on the issue of work at least, the answers mostly seemed facile. There are many lenses through which the world is viewed today - politically, economically, psychoanalytically - but you wouldn't know it from these senior common room speculations. Curiously, the only really nuanced and critical take on received wisdom came from Tilbury, the voice of religion. </p> <p>Of course, those who rue the frenzied contemporary culture of jargon and argot find The Brains Trust attractive because, with its Telemann opening music and unhurried ratiocination, it sounds as though it belongs in another universe. But this isn't the 40s anymore, when unscripted high table talk seemed positively revolutionary. Now we've got Start the Week and In Our Time regularly debating intellectual issues. The Brains Trust sounds like heritage radio. </p> <p>Radio 4's award-winning series of teenagers' audio diaries, Fresh Air, rudely transposed us back to the 21st century. It kicked off with 16-year-old Tinu who, synopsised, sounds like PC incarnate: she is black, Christian and disabled, and was abandoned by her father when she was three. </p> <p>In fact, this was one of the most powerful radio programmes I've heard. Tinu is so self-conscious and self-preoccupied that she is riled if people look at her but feels invisible if they don't. Hearing her talk softly into her mike as, braving the bystanders, she made the taxing journey into school put one right in there with her. </p> <p>By the end, this had become an extraordinarily raw, intimate document. The articulate Tinu poured in all her hurt about the loss of her father and her struggle to avoid becoming a victim, exciting terrific empathy. If the BBC has any sense it will put her passionate fluency into one of those discussion programmes. Radio needs such voices, not just as case histories and social problems, but as definers and interpreters of the world. </p> <p>Finally, the most memorable words of the week came from Paul Fox. In The House that Birt Built (Radio 4), he summed up John Birt's BBC reign as \"too much bias and not enough understanding\".</p>",

There are many lenses through which the world is viewed today - politically, economically, psychoanalytically - but you wouldn't know it from these senior common room speculations. Curiously, the only really nuanced and critical take on received wisdom came from Tilbury, the voice of religion. Of course, those who rue the frenzied contemporary culture of jargon and argot find The Brains Trust attractive because, with its Telemann opening music and unhurried ratiocination, it sounds as though it belongs in another universe. But this isn't the 40s anymore, when unscripted high table talk seemed positively revolutionary. Now we've got Start the Week and In Our Time regularly debating intellectual issues. The Brains Trust sounds like heritage radio. Radio 4's award-winning series of teenagers' audio diaries, Fresh Air, rudely transposed us back to the 21st century. It kicked off with 16-year-old Tinu who, synopsised, sounds like PC incarnate: she is black, Christian and disabled, and was abandoned by her father when she was three. In fact, this was one of the most powerful radio programmes I've heard. Tinu is so self-conscious and self-preoccupied that she is riled if people look at her but feels invisible if they don't. Hearing her talk softly into her mike as, braving the bystanders, she made the taxing journey into school put one right in there with her. By the end, this had become an extraordinarily raw, intimate document. The articulate Tinu poured in all her hurt about the loss of her father and her struggle to avoid becoming a victim, exciting terrific empathy. If the BBC has any sense it will put her passionate fluency into one of those discussion programmes. Radio needs such voices, not just as case histories and social problems, but as definers and interpreters of the world. Finally, the most memorable words of the week came from Paul Fox. In The House that Birt Built (Radio 4), he summed up John Birt's BBC reign as \"too much bias and not enough understanding\".",

This year's treat has got to be Rancid Aluminium, in which a gaggle of ace Brit faces - Tara Fitzgerald, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, a Fiennes, Dani Behr, Nick Moran - are left with a good deal of egg on them. Bless! </p> <p>The reviews for the film have been uniformly vile, but the one that interested me most pointed out that, as both Steven Berkoff and Keith Allen were in it, its dreadfulness was signalled well in advance and so anyone who parted with their money for a ticket expecting decent - as opposed to indecent - entertainment had only themselves to blame. The way this critic described it, the Allen/Berkoff alliance was a sort of Stalin-Hitler pact of bad acting and general hammery. </p> <p>Now, I know that, while living the lotus-eating life down here in soft old Sussex, I've taken my eye off the ball a bit in recent years, but the last time I looked both Berkoff and Allen were bywords for raw, simmering sexuality, fierce integrity and, frankly, incendiary talent. Now, apparently, they pack a punch somewhere between that of Mutt and Jeff, and Crystal Tips and Alistair. In short, they've Lost It. How'd that happen? </p> <p>I think I know. It's because people want to lose it. This is a previously unexplored avenue, as credibility is popularly considered something that we cling to through thick and thin. As a lividly thin, pale, credible young thing (moi) wrote in the Face back in - aaiiieeee! - 1984: \"Credibility has replaced paying one's dues as the official credentials needed before a career in the communications industry can get off the launch pad. When you are rich and famous, you can do without it - though it hurts you so! - and once it is gone you will just have to live with the loss. Like virginity or a contact lens, once you lose your credibility you won't get it back, at least not in this life.\" </p> <p>But was I happy? Well, yes, but not as happy as I am now that I'm a portly old hack with about as much cred as a hostess trolley. I was talented, too; why, looking back at my second collection, Sex And Sensibility, I think there's a case for saying that between the years of 1983 and 1992 I was the best critic and essayist in this country, which probably means THE WORLD. Those were the days when I could change Kim Philby's mind about giving another interview to the West; when Radio 4 called me \"the cleverest woman in Britain\". </p> <p>And did I enjoy it? No. Couldn't handle it. Used to get actually physically sick before I wrote; I was thinking too much, you see. Nowadays I only get sick when I drink too much, which is a much better deal. </p> <p>There is a real, sensual kick that comes with Losing It, which I'm sure Messrs Berkoff and Allen have discovered for themselves and which explains why they are pursuing their goal so thoroughly. You're not meant to say it, though. You can leave your children, dump your spouse and put your parents out to grass on a sex farm, and still get away with it, in reasonably Bohemian circles. But if you - happily! - admit to betraying your talent, there's the most ridiculous amount of wailing, teeth-gnashing and finger-pointing. </p> <p>It's mean to say it, of course, but the types who go in for this sort of moralising - oh what you could have been! - are always the types who never had any talent themselves in the first place, and so can't believe you had the gall to throw yours away. Think of poor Salieri, beseeching God to give the Gift to him and not to that moronic, dirty-minded \"creature\", Mozart. Or of the hotel waiter who turned up at George Best's suite door bearing two bottles of Mo\u00ebt on ice: Best was back in Belfast to open a supermarket, for which he'd been paid \u00a320,000 in cash, which now lay scattered across the king-size bed; his latest squeeze was the current Miss World, Mary Stavin, who was sat at the dressing table wearing two wisps of oyster silk and fixing her hair. The waiter took it all in - the Miss World, the \u00a320,000, the champagne - and uttered the heartfelt cry, \"Oh, George, where did it all go wrong?\" </p> <p> Likewise, Laurence Olivier told Vivien Leigh, \"I am sick of the myth of the Glorious Couple\", and promptly retired to Brighton with Joan Plowright, a woman as plain as her name, to commute every day to the Royal Court in London, taking a great delight in wearing his sober suit and hat, carrying an umbrella and briefcase, and passing for normal. Making films as bad as Harold Robbins' The Betsy was the ultimate luxury for him, not hardship - he was cocking a snook at that final sacred cow, his talent. The same happened to Richard Burton when he dumped the goddesses for a BBC PR girl and threw himself into a welter of bad films. It's like climbing Everest, destroying your talent; you do it because it's there. </p> <p>If you've got it, flaunt it; if it ain't broke, break it. After a few years, there's something a bit precious about having too much talent, something a bit up yourself. Far better to throw it on the fire and join the hoi polloi. This, I am sure, was the reasoning behind the decision of those Titan talents, Keith Allen and Steven Berkoff, to make a film as bad as Rancid Aluminium.

Oh yes, and there was a shooting in the corridor - 20 bullets fired and only one man down. The security guard? Just fainted, though that wrist wound needed suturing. Nice touch. </p> <p>Amid this weekly flurry of vignettes there never seems to be a quiet moment for coffee and a game of draughts.

Like John, Frank has always put the Labour party first, campaigning tirelessly for candidates in byelections and general elections. John appointed Frank as the first shadow minister for London because of his commitment to the city. Working with London members Frank helped to secure the best ever local election results in London. John was Labour through and through. I know that Frank is the same and that his vision for a more equal, fairer, decent London is one John would have shared. I urge London members to give him their support. Baroness Elizabeth Smith Edinburgh \u0095 Slagging off Ken Livingstone in the national and London press is obviously part of a New Labour MP's job description. However, I was astonished to pick up the Argus in Sussex and find local Blairite MP Ivor Caplin accusing Ken of using Brighton as a \"tax-haven\". Before he wastes more ink, someone should remind Mr Caplin that London is 50 miles away and we don't get a vote. Andy Player Brighton andyplayer@hotmail.com \u0095 So Frank Dobson thinks Ken Livingstone is alienating Afro-Caribbean voters by not asking Trevor Phillips to be his running mate (Dobson attacks Millbank 'mess', January 28). What does this say about Dobson's choice of a man to be his deputy? Or maybe women's votes don't count. Fiona and Nick Jenkins Leeds nick@235hpr.freeserve.co.uk \u0095 I'm sick of receiving begging letters from Dobbo - seven to date. These mail shots have probably cost (who?) over \u00a3150,000. Geoffrey Sheridan London geoffrey.sheridan@talk21.com \u0095 Now you've found 101 uses for the Dome (Letters, January 27), can anyone think of 101 uses for a Dobson mailshot? Chris Willis London \u0095 After 1,000 days, it is time to open a debate on the choice of New Labour's campaign song for the next election - one suspects that, no matter how appropriate, they won't be using Things Can Only Get Better again. Although tempted by alternatives such as I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and You Can't Always Get What You Want, my considered nomination is Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word.

This year 30 to 40 couples will marry in our church; some of them are making second marriages. Not all those who ask eventually receive the reply they want.

Like any diagnosis it may be wrong, but it has to be attempted.</p> <p>Those who marry here are certainly not doing it to please the church. Their previous relationships will have broken down for a number of reasons - social, personal, spiritual and psychological.

      "bodyText": "Anglican vicars are not, by and large, \"awfully nice people\" (Leader, January 26) - 19 years of ordained ministry have taught me that. What they may be, at their best, are people who work with those experiencing life's harder side in an atmosphere of realism and hope. This year 30 to 40 couples will marry in our church; some of them are making second marriages. Not all those who ask eventually receive the reply they want. This has nothing to do with ersatz therapy, but with the work of discerning what is really going on inside people that has always been the job of a priest or pastor. Like any diagnosis it may be wrong, but it has to be attempted. Those who marry here are certainly not doing it to please the church. Their previous relationships will have broken down for a number of reasons - social, personal, spiritual and psychological. They are looking for a new start in life for themselves and the people they belong to. Some of them will be helped to achieve this and that is good news. Chris Swift Rector of St Nicholas Shepperton, Middx \u0095 Following a traumatic illness, my husband walked out on 26 years of happy marriage to live with his newly acquired mistress. I tried to preserve our marriage, but after five years, the court allowed the dissolution of the marriage and a vicar friend of the couple agreed to marry them in their local church.

DebtCall estimates that personal sector borrowing in 1999 reached \u00a3614.8bn, surpassing \u00a3600bn for the first time. Of this total, credit cards represent \u00a330.5bn, a 30% rise on 1998 and an average balance for every card issued of about \u00a3750.</p> <p>These figures indicate the extent to which we are increasingly comfortable with debt. But if comfort becomes complacency, that can be a dangerous thing.</p> <p>DebtCall, which operates a free telephone advice line (see below for the number), has been bombarded with calls from people who cannot cover their regular monthly bills after the Christmas blow-out. Mr Thomson says the number of people who pay off their card bills every month has fallen and, according to the British Bankers' Association, fewer than half of all card holders now pay this way. As each month slips by, more people find themselves in arrears. DebtCall estimates that \u00a330.7bn of the total private debt is due to late payments.</p> <p>The symptoms of excessive debt are not hard to spot. First you will find it harder to meet normal costs, such as heating bills and the weekly shop. Then, as a temporary measure, you will consider using credit cards to cover these costs until you are \"back on your feet\". Finally, if the pressure does not let up, you may consider taking out a loan to get creditors off your back. If these symptoms seem to fit your circumstances now is the time to take action.</p> <p>Failure to do so could lead to personal insolvency. This is defined in two ways: when your debts outweigh the means to pay them back, taking into account all worldly possessions; or when you are unable to pay bills as they fall due. Shirley Jackson, a council member of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, says the latter is the more common: \"That's much more likely to catch people out. You shouldn't have to sell your house first,\" she says. The worst case is bankruptcy. If your debts are greater than \u00a320,000, bankruptcy will last three years during which you will not be able to buy a mortgage, hold a credit card, look after anyone else's money, become a company director or stand as an MP.</p> <p><b>How to cope when you can't pay</b></p> <p>* Stop borrowing. Do not be tempted to borrow to pay off existing debts</p> <p>* Do not try to ignore debts or hope your creditors will forget. Contact them immediately to let them know there may be a delay in payment</p> <p>* Sit down with a piece of paper and work out how much you owe. Include everything from outstanding payments on hire purchase goods to mortgage instalments. Then work out your income and your expenditure. Anything left over from your income after you subtract essential expenditure should be put towards clearing debts</p> <p>* Work out which debts must be paid first. This will require balancing between essentials - such as mortgage repayments and electricity bills - and priority debts, such as court fines</p> <p>* Seek professional help. The calculations you have made so far will help advisers to understand your situation (see below for useful phone numbers)</p> <p>* Draw up a pro-rata payment plan. Using your calculations, work out how much money, if any, you can spare to pay off debts. Then work out how much each debt represents as a total of the whole. Divide the available money up and pay this towards each debt every month. For instance, if your credit card bill accounts for 25% of your total debt and you have \u00a3100 available to cover the total you should put \u00a325 towards that bill each month. This will be useful if you have to appear in court as proof that you have taken reasonable steps to pay your debts</p> <p>* Do not be intimidated by debt collectors. Insist that all communication is by letter. This will be useful if you have to appear in court and you will find it easier to keep a cool head</p> <p>* If you receive a court summons, do not ignore it. If you fail to turn up, an order for payment may be made in your absence - thereby adding to your problems.</p> <p>Apart from DebtCall (0800-980-5060) the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux offers debt counselling (0171-833-2181). Other sources of help are the National Debtline on 0808-808-4000 and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service on 0800-138-1111, which will arrange an appointment to see a counsellor.</p>",

This is defined in two ways: when your debts outweigh the means to pay them back, taking into account all worldly possessions; or when you are unable to pay bills as they fall due. Shirley Jackson, a council member of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, says the latter is the more common: \"That's much more likely to catch people out. You shouldn't have to sell your house first,\" she says. The worst case is bankruptcy. If your debts are greater than \u00a320,000, bankruptcy will last three years during which you will not be able to buy a mortgage, hold a credit card, look after anyone else's money, become a company director or stand as an MP. How to cope when you can't pay * Stop borrowing. Do not be tempted to borrow to pay off existing debts * Do not try to ignore debts or hope your creditors will forget. Contact them immediately to let them know there may be a delay in payment * Sit down with a piece of paper and work out how much you owe. Include everything from outstanding payments on hire purchase goods to mortgage instalments. Then work out your income and your expenditure. Anything left over from your income after you subtract essential expenditure should be put towards clearing debts * Work out which debts must be paid first. This will require balancing between essentials - such as mortgage repayments and electricity bills - and priority debts, such as court fines * Seek professional help. The calculations you have made so far will help advisers to understand your situation (see below for useful phone numbers) * Draw up a pro-rata payment plan. Using your calculations, work out how much money, if any, you can spare to pay off debts. Then work out how much each debt represents as a total of the whole. Divide the available money up and pay this towards each debt every month. For instance, if your credit card bill accounts for 25% of your total debt and you have \u00a3100 available to cover the total you should put \u00a325 towards that bill each month. This will be useful if you have to appear in court as proof that you have taken reasonable steps to pay your debts * Do not be intimidated by debt collectors. Insist that all communication is by letter. This will be useful if you have to appear in court and you will find it easier to keep a cool head * If you receive a court summons, do not ignore it. If you fail to turn up, an order for payment may be made in your absence - thereby adding to your problems. Apart from DebtCall (0800-980-5060) the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux offers debt counselling (0171-833-2181). Other sources of help are the National Debtline on 0808-808-4000 and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service on 0800-138-1111, which will arrange an appointment to see a counsellor.",

Accounts that top the league include the Bristol City account offered by Bristol &amp; West, the Yorkshire Terriers account from Yorkshire building society, which raises money for Huddersfield Town, and the Barnsley-linked Reds Saver operated by Barnsley building society. From tomorrow the Yorkshire Terriers account pays 4.70% gross on a minimum balance of \u00a325, while from February 7 the Bristol City account will pay 4.75% gross on balances of \u00a3100-plus. The Reds Saver offers 4.50% gross on balances of \u00a3100 or more. In all cases, 1% of the average balance is paid to the club. However, while all three offer instant access, some come with restrictions - the Bristol City account only allows 12 withdrawals a year. Other high-paying accounts include the St Andrew's Saver account for Birmingham City fans operated by Legal &amp; General Bank, and the Woolwich's Charlton Premier, aimed at Charlton Athletic supporters. These offer rates starting at 4.15% and 4.25% gross respectively. Less generous ones include Bath building society's Pirates Super Saver account for Bristol Rovers fans, which pays 1.50% gross on balances below \u00a31,000, and Darlington building society's accounts for Darlington and Hartlepool United supporters, which pay a minuscule 0.10% gross on balances of \u00a31 to \u00a3500 and just 1.60% gross from \u00a3500 to \u00a34,999. However, there are perks. The Canary and Bristol City accounts are among those that offer a 5% discount on a season ticket and a free mortgage valuation. A bigger voice for fans A new government-backed scheme will give football fans a bigger say in running teams they support. It could see clubs adopting mutual ownership. The Supporters Direct scheme will help fans with advice on how to organise supporters' trust holdings in their clubs. These would control individual supporters' holdings so fans could use their united strength to keep clubs safe from asset strippers. The project is backed by the Co-operative Bank which will give free banking and help. The bank foresees partnerships with local authorities, often the team's landlords, which could lead to a mutual form of ownership. It cites Northampton Town and Bournemouth as examples of good practice.",

For those who have already been through an expensive divorce the thought may be compelling enough to try to negotiate a pre-nuptial agreement which will regulate what happens should the marriage fail. Michael Douglas is reported to be the latest celebrity to have gone down this line, asking fianc\u00e9e Catherine Zeta-Jones to sign an agreement which will restrict her share of his fortune should they divorce.</p> <p>Such agreements are unenforceable in Britain, unlike in America where they are routine among the super-rich. However, it is possible the law here may change soon to give them limited recognition. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 lists the factors courts should take into account when making financial orders on divorce.

      "bodyText": "It may not be too romantic but, \"How much will this cost me if it all goes wrong?\" is a question that crosses the mind of many people about to marry. For those who have already been through an expensive divorce the thought may be compelling enough to try to negotiate a pre-nuptial agreement which will regulate what happens should the marriage fail. Michael Douglas is reported to be the latest celebrity to have gone down this line, asking fianc\u00e9e Catherine Zeta-Jones to sign an agreement which will restrict her share of his fortune should they divorce. Such agreements are unenforceable in Britain, unlike in America where they are routine among the super-rich. However, it is possible the law here may change soon to give them limited recognition. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 lists the factors courts should take into account when making financial orders on divorce. These include the needs of the couple and their children, their resources and earning capacity, their health, their contributions and the length of the marriage. Conspicuously absent from this list is any agreement they may have made before or after marrying.

      "bodyText": "Does your lender calculate interest on a daily basis? Halifax: No, but launching a range of mortgages with daily interest calculation in June. Abbey National: A third of 30-plus mortgages currently on offer feature daily interest calculation, including its flexible mortgage. Nationwide: No, but does offer daily interest calculation for overpayments. Woolwich: On 10 of its 24 mortgage deals currently available, the Woolwich calculates interest daily but charges it monthly. Northern Rock: Of 11 products currently available, only its flexible mortgage offers this. NatWest: No. Barclays: No, though its base rate tracker features monthly interest calculation. Alliance &amp; Leicester: No. However, it calculates interest monthly on its flexible mortgages. Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society: No. But, does allow borrowers to make part repayments which are credited the following month. Standard Life Bank: Yes (it offers only one deal, the Freestyle flexible mortgage, launched in January 1999). Do the loans carry extended redemption penalties, tying you in for perhaps several years after the fixed/capped period ends? Halifax: No - axed them from new mortgage products last year. Says only a \"very small percentage\" of existing borrowers likely to be tied in by overhanging redemption penalties. Abbey National: Axed them from new mortgage products in 1998. Some existing borrowers tied in by penalties. Nationwide: Current range - no. No idea how many existing borrowers affected. Woolwich: Yes, six of the 24 deals have overhanging penalties. Unable to say how many existing borrowers affected. Northern Rock: Only one of the current deals has overhanging penalties, but the \"overhang\" is substantial (a two-year fixed rate with penalties for a total of six years). NatWest: Current range, no. Barclays: No - axed them more than six months ago. A \"small minority\" of existing borrowers likely to be affected. Alliance &amp; Leicester: Yes, three of the 10 deals on offer have overhanging penalties. Around 30% of home loans sold in 1999 involve extended redemption penalties. Norwich &amp; Peterborough: Current range, no. Some existing borrowers affected. Standard Life Bank: The loan does have an overhanging penalty - the 6.65% standard variable rate is discounted by 0.89% for the first six months, with a penalty of three months' gross interest if you walk away in the first 12 months. Do any of its loans track the base rate? Halifax: Launched its first base rate tracker loans last summer. About 10 of the 30 loans currently on offer are trackers. Abbey National: Only one, its flexible mortgage, launched in June 1999. Nationwide: Only one, its base rate tracker, launched last year. Woolwich: Nine of the 24 current deals do. Northern Rock: Current range, no. Did offer a base rate tracker last year. NatWest: Only one, its base rate tracker mortgage. Barclays: Eight out of the 14 on offer do. Alliance &amp; Leicester: Four of the 10 deals on offer, including its base rate tracker, have rates linked \"in full or in part\" to the base rate. Norwich &amp; Peterborough: No. Standard Life Bank: No. Do any of its current deals involve the borrower having to take the lender's buildings/ contents insurance? Halifax: Axed compulsory insurance about seven years ago, so only \"a handful\" of existing borrowers affected. Abbey National: Axed compulsory insurance from core product range about 10 years ago, so very few of the existing borrowers affected. Nationwide: No. Woolwich: Axed compulsory insurance in March 1999. Says \"small minority\" of existing borrowers affected. Northern Rock: Axed compulsory insurance in summer 1999. Unable to say how many existing borrowers affected. NatWest: No. It has no figures for existing borrowers. Barclays: No. Says \"a small minority\" of existing borrowers likely to be affected. Alliance &amp; Leicester: No. Only 2% of borrowers who took out loans in 1999 affected. Norwich &amp; Peterborough: Yes. It has 15 different deals, each available both with and without compulsory insurance (those without have less attractive rates). Standard Life Bank: No. Is there an arrangement fee? If so, how much? Halifax: No arrangement fee on any of current deals. A \"small percentage\" of existing borrowers will have paid one. Abbey National: Says \"under 50%\" of current range carry a booking fee (typically \u00a3150). No figures on how many existing borrowers affected. Nationwide: Of the 19 loans on offer, seven have a \"reservation fee\". Usually \u00a395 and applies to fixed and capped rate products. No figures on how many existing borrowers affected. Woolwich: Of the 24 deals, 13 have an \"application fee\" (typically \u00a3195). Northern Rock: Nine of its 11 deals carry an arrangement fee varying from \u00a3395-\u00a3495. Existing borrowers on fixed/discounted rate etc likely to have paid a fee. NatWest: Says all 23 products will have an arrangement fee. Typically \u00a3295, but for two of them (graduate mortgages) it is \u00a31. Barclays: Three of its 14 deals carry an arrangement fee (typically \u00a3295). Says majority of existing borrowers likely to have paid one. Alliance &amp; Leicester: Of the 10 loans on offer, five carry an arrangement fee (typically \u00a3295). Norwich &amp; Peterborough: All the deals carry an arrangement fee (typically \u00a3295) which is added to the account. Standard Life Bank: No.",

The independent Electoral Reform Society confirmed yesterday that 587 signatures - the minimum needed to trigger a vote under new government rules - have been validated on a petition collected in Ripon, North Yorkshire. National campaigners from both sides will now descend on the small market town to canvass parents of children at the grammar school's main feeder primary schools.

The result is expected by Easter and a victory for reformers would see selection abolished in 2002. The vote will be a pointer to the fortunes of England's 163 other selective grammar schools. Ripon is openly divided on the issue, with strong anti-selection feeling matched by affection for the grammar, founded in 1663, which topped North Yorkshire's state school academic league table this year. The argument has also been complicated by attempts to revive Ripon College, the nearby state school which came bottom of the same league table. The school was awarded specialist technology status last week, bringing \u00a3120,000 funding plus \u00a3120-a-head for its 600 pupils over the next four years. The heads of both schools are barred from campaigning, but have both declared their support for the status quo.

He speaks from the heart about his brother Liam, his wife Meg, the baby on the way - and the album that charts his turnaround. By Lindsay Baker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Just when was it that the glamour of Oasis first started to fade? When did their seductive supernova swagger cease to be sexy, and begin to seem graceless? Was it when a heavily bearded Liam Gallagher set upon an unsuspecting fan in Australia, breaking his nose? Or was it when even Liam's impeccable singing voice failed to disguise the fundamental pub-rock flavour of the band's third album? Somewhere along the line, a couple of years back, Oasis began to resemble a parody of themselves. Then, last year, to make matters worse, both the guitarist and bass-player suddenly walked away from the group, and were swiftly followed by the boss of the band's label.</p> <p>The glorious, giddy heights of Champagne Supernova and Wonderwall seem long gone, as are the days when the irreverent, hedonistic Gallagher brothers, boozing for England, could do no wrong: Noel and wife Meg partying at Downing Street; luscious Liam and pouting Patsy posing glossily under a Union Jack duvet on the cover of Vanity Fair's Swinging London issue, the sexy ubercouple - so much more fun than their usurpers, Posh and Becks.</p> <p>The Oasis party started in 1993 and continued pretty much unabated until 1997. They brightened the Major years, saw in New Labour and (What's The Story?) Morning Glory sold 12 million copies worldwide, topped only by the Spice Girls in the 90s.</p> <p>Not that their third album, Be Here Now, didn't sell. It did - six million copies, to be precise. It was not that Oasis had become less successful, just less fashionable - and less likeable. For Noel Gallagher, it was the 1997 world tour that did it. The nose-breaking incident in Australia was symptomatic. \"It just turned into a travelling piss-up,\" he admits now, as he sits sipping tea. \"Bonehead and Liam were just fuckin' out of control, and I was trying to keep everyone together and trying to explain that people had stopped talking about the music and were just talking about the bullshit that surrounded the band. But after about a month, I just gave up and thought, fuck it, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" It was not a great time for the band's public image: internationally, the view of them was \"a bunch of lunatics who come roaring through town drunk, smash the place up, play a couple of gigs and fuck off again. We did some shocking gigs on the last tour purely because we'd been out too much the night before. As soon as we put the instruments down, we'd go out and get absolutely shit-faced.\"</p> <p>He sounds almost repentant. I'd expected him to be sober (he'd recently declared his new, clean status), but I thought that he might be aggressive or arrogant. None of that. He's not what you'd call humble, exactly, but he's polite, friendly even. And in spite of what he fears may be the onset of flu (\"you know something's wrong when cigarettes start to taste bad\"), he looks rather well, all bright-eyed and clear-skinned. In spite of the band's downward spiral, something, it seems, stopped them from throwing it all away. They pulled themselves back from the brink of terminal self-indulgence and self-destruction, and have emerged from the chaos of the past few years with a new line-up, their own record label and an excellent new album, Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants.</p> <p>It's not a radical departure, and Noel's songwriting style remains the same, but Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is more subtle than its predecessors, more of a \"grower\", and sounds perceptibly more modern than the previous three albums. \"We needed a fresh inspiration from somewhere,\" says Noel. They enlisted Mark \"Spike\" Stent to co-produce with Noel. \"If there's one person who can embellish a rock'n'roll sounding band, then Spike's the man, because he's worked with U2, Madonna, Massive Attack and Bjourk, and he has one foot in the rock'n'roll camp and one in contemporary, electronic music. He'd always liked the band, but he thought that the records sounded crap, which was his opening line to us.\"</p> <p>The songs are more personal, and there is less of the Supersonic-style sloganeering. Noel stopped writing lyrics \"that just rhymed or sounded good. It's hard to write a really deeply personal song and then give it to someone else who's five years younger than you to express it down the microphone. But Liam's got to understand that, from now on, the songs are going to get more meaningful to me and probably less meaningful to him. And he'll understand as he gets older.\"</p> <p>The way Noel describes it, it's hard to know which was more insane, being on a deranged, drugs-driven world tour or being at home in London, where the party continued in much the same way. The new album is more about the comedown than the highs. Where Did It All Go Wrong? is a track written just before Noel and Meg, both now 32, moved out of Supernova Heights, their home in Belsize Park, north London.</p> <p>Their house had turned into a nightclub, he says, \"a pretty good one at that. The bar was always open, the door was always open, there were more people coming in and out than I ever got to know. I must have wasted years sitting there with the curtains closed talking about bullishit - aliens, pyramids, debating 'did they really land on the moon, let's watch the footage again in slow motion' or 'crop circles - what's that all about?'\" One morning, he looked in the mirror at his yellow skin and popping eyes, unable to focus, with a load of strangers in the kitchen, and thought, \"Oh fuck, how did we get here?\"</p> <p>Sunday Morning Call is about a particular person on a self-destruct mission, who is \"too rock'n'roll for their own good\". My guess is Kate Moss. \"Could be - she's one of my mates, but I wouldn't like to say who it's about.\" Did Noel never think of checking himself into the Priory, the usual drying-out route favoured by the rich and famous? \"I never understand people who spend \u00a350,000 a month to cure a \u00a310,000-a-month habit. And it creates another shit storm and a media circus, and people lie about why they're going in, and say they're 'stressed out'.\" Instead, Noel and Meg sold their London house and moved to Buckinghamshire. He took the phone off the hook and stayed in. Gas Panic, the new album's darkest track, was written while weaning himself off cocaine - \"going cold turkey, without wanting to sound too dramatic about it\" - in the midst of a night-time panic attack. \"It's basically a paranoid drugs song.\"</p> <p>Even when the house wasn't full of party guests, life then at Supernova Heights sounds nightmarishly reminiscent of the Burton-Taylor carousing years. A drugs-and-booze-fuelled Noel and Meg were rowing \"about fuck all. 'You said that to that person and they said that about me.'\" Finally, says Noel, \"I picked my missus up off the kitchen floor\" and the two of them set off on a month-long holiday to Thailand. \"We'd never really hung out together sober,\" he says. \"We met through drugs. Our relationship was surrounded by drugs. We got married when we were pissed. Though we weren't drunk when we decided to get married,\" he adds hastily. \"When I decided I was going to come off it and change the way I lived, in the beginning it was, like - how's that gonna be with our relationship. Am I still gonna like her?\"</p> <p>The holiday was a success, and he wrote the album's most uplifting track, the tranquil Who Feels Love, after a visit to a temple. \"It was the calm after the storm. I suppose I was feeling at one with the world.\" He had become \"re-acquainted\" with his wife. \"It was like, 'Yeah, she is cool',\" he says. \"'And I do actually like her. I love her.'\"</p> <p>Then, on their second wedding anniversary last year, Meg told her husband that she was pregnant, \"as luck would have it\", he beams (by the time you read this, the baby's arrival will be imminent). \"That gave us something else. You go on being young and having nothing to keep you grounded... I like that I'm not going to be able to let myself go any more, because I'm going to have to be there.\" It was good timing, for both of them. Without the pregnancy, it might have been harder for Meg to quit the rock'n'roll lifestyle, says her husband. \"Meg is hardcore, her and her fuckin' girlfriends are worse than any bunch of guys I've ever been out with.\" I find that hard to believe. \"I mean it, man,\" he says seriously. \"They are fuckin' hardcore rock'n'roll women. They can be a bit scary when they're out, actually,\" he smiles. \"She's easily led, that woman,\" he says, rather fondly, \"especially by mates who are 10 years younger than her. Meg always wanted kids, anyway, and I was, like, well, if it happens it happens, but I was over the moon that it did.\"</p> <p>When guitarist Bonehead and bass-player Guigsy left the band in August last year, Liam \"freaked out\", but Noel was philosophical about it. \"By their own admission, they weren't very good musicians,\" he says. They signed up rhythm guitarist Gem, formerly of Heavy Stereo, and bassist Andy Bell, formerly of Ride, to join the Gallaghers and drummer Andy White, and the new line-up made its debut in Philadelphia last December. The full world tour starts in Japan next month, ending up in the UK in July.</p> <p>Noel is equally sanguine about the departure earlier this month of Alan McGee, the boss of Creation who originally signed up the band on the spot at a small gig in Glasgow and who has left to set up an internet company. \"With two members leaving and then this, it looked like a big shit sandwich. But when you go to bed at night it's a crisis, and when you wake up in the morning it's just another problem to be solved.\" Liam was quoted as saying that he felt deserted by McGee, for whom the band had made around \u00a330 million. \"I know for a fact he just said that for effect, because I know he wasn't upset with Alan when he left. I dunno why he's saying he's broken-hearted because to be broken-hearted you have to have a heart, and he hasn't. He might think he does. He's got a soul, but he's not got a heart.\"</p> <p>Creation Records has now folded, and 30 staff were made redundant. Noel feels for them, but says, matter-of-factly, \"it's not the first record label that's folded, and it won't be the last . . . If it hadn't been for Alan, I wouldn't have signed off the dole. It works both ways. We made him a lot of money. He gave us the chance to make him a lot of money. He left us in a pretty decent position.\" The band have now set up their own label, Big Brother, though they remain under the auspices of parent company Sony.</p> <p>A large number of young Britons spent their formative years on the late-80s rave scene, a movement that sparked a tabloid moral panic - and one that was largely outlawed by the Tory government. For those people, hedonism and anti-authoritarianism went hand in hand. So, when Oasis appeared in 1993, extolling the virtues of drugs - \"like having a cup of tea\", as Noel famously phrased it once - and proudly displaying their working-class, anti-establishment credentials, it's no surpise that the \"chemical generation\" took to them. Like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses before them, Oasis tapped straight into the rebellious, feel-good moment.</p> <p>After he'd made the famous drugs-and-tea comment, Noel recalls returning to his previous home in St John's Wood to find his house surrounded by journalists and the street cordoned off. He went to a friend's place. There had been questions raised in Parliament, and the then Home Secretary, Michael Howard, was on television demanding that he be kicked out of the country. \"Two years later, I was arriving at Downing Street in a Rolls-Royce and thinking, 'I hope you're fuckin' watching this now.'\"</p> <p>His mum was very proud, he says, as was Meg's mother, a former trades unionist. \"And, of course, I was entirely convinced I was going to get a knighthood,\" he laughs. The post-victory euphoria was still tangible in Britain. Again in repentant mode, he says that he wished he'd called his Liverpool docker acquaintances the night before to ask if there was anything they wanted him to say to Tony Blair. \"But of course I went there for the infamy more than anything, and it was, like, 'You're top.' 'No, you're top.' 'No, you're fuckin' top.' 'Well, thanks a lot, here's a gold disc.'\" Whatever he may think of Blair now - he says he became disillusioned when the Government started \"taking money off single mothers and students\" - he's still glad that he went to Downing Street. \"Once. I wouldn't do it again.\" He concedes that Blair's spin doctors were using him to heighten New Labour's credibility, \"but we'd had 18 years of the fuckin' Tories drip-drying this country almost out of business. I'd voted Labour all my life.\"</p> <p>Oasis's laddish demeanour was also very of-the-moment in the early days. Back in 1993, Loaded magazine was soon to be launched, and \"lad culture\", though not to everyone's taste, had at least a new frankness and honesty about it. The band's brashness seemed emblematic of a shift in British male identity. The popular perception of Oasis is still steeped in drugs, violence and sex. Is that a good thing? Noel pauses for a moment. \"I can see that when we came along at the arse end of '93, it was Suede and all them lot, and we were, like, 'Right. They're shit. They're shit. You're fuckin' totally shit. Chop 'em out. Get us a fuckin' beer. Hello darlin'.' And the kids went berserk, because they were, like, 'that's me incarnate, how cool is that'. And the more people said it, the more we just went berserk. And we lived up to it for a while.\"</p> <p>Liam, although calmer nowadays, still does, off and on. He \"went missing\" for a few days last November, and the tabloids made the most of it. For Noel, such behaviour, even now, is not without its advantages: \"I was thinking, 'For fuck's sake, not again', but to some kid living in a council block in Glasgow, I bet he was going, 'You fuckin' go on, my son, you really don't give a fuck, Liam'.\" Episodes such as this - and Liam's scrape with the law for drugs possession a few years back - help Joe Public connect with the band, Noel believes. He can understand the media obsession with Liam and Patsy, he says. \"Rockstar. Headcase. Actress. Headcase. Little blonde chick, lunatic with a beard. I can see why people wonder what's going on behind closed doors.\" Patsy's recent comments in GQ magazine about the couple's sex life made front-page news in many of the tabloids.</p> <p>Not that Liam and Patsy have a monopoly on the column inches, of course. At one point, Noel was approached by the tabloids to comment on more or less any subject: the Royal Family, the Labour Party, other bands. \"They'd be, like, 'get someone round to Gallagher's house. He'll be up, he'll give you a quote'.\" And Noel would invariably oblige, usually drunk. \"I'd be, like, 'What? The French? What've they done? Nicking our fish? Fuck 'em! Fuckin' French! And I'd go into one.\"</p> <p>Nor has Meg exactly shunned the limelight. Her high public profile, frequently in Gucci, has added to the Gallaghers' seeming ubiquity. Unlike Patsy, who, since her days as the Bird's Eye peas girl, has been used to life in the public eye, celebrity was thrust upon Meg suddenly, and she embraced it. Her short-lived column in the Sunday Times, while curiously compelling, did little to enhance the band's mystique. Noel was not keen. \"I went fuckin' ballistic. We have heated debates about stuff like that. To me it was just celebrity name-dropping and it was wrong.\" But the paper was offering her \u00a350,000, and her party-organising business with friend Fran Cutler had not, at that point, taken off. \"She wouldn't want anyone to think that she sits at home all day, eating cream cakes and spending my money. She's her own woman. At the end of the day, we had to agree to disagree. I would never put my foot down and tell her what to do. She'd tell me to piss off.\"</p> <p>These days, \"lad culture\" has begun to look a bit tired. The Loaded ethos has been lifted and transformed by the wider men's magazine market, and the media generally, into something more ubiquitous and more cynical. For Oasis still to appear fresh, something more than a reputation for hell-raising is needed to justify their status, something more profound, and no one is more aware of that than Noel. But his approach is double-edged. On the one hand, he acknowledges that the mad-for-it melodrama helps people feel a connection with the band. On the other hand, he refuses to indulge his little brother. \"I'm the only person who'll tell it like it is. He has a lot of people who pussyfoot around him and say, 'He does this because of that'. Fuck him. He's 27. He's a millionaire. I'm not having it that his life is any worse than someone who's living in fuckin' Leicester, who's got two kids and no fuckin' job. I'm not having any of that shit.\"</p> <p>Liam doesn't always like hearing that, or reading it in print; it seems demeaning to him. \"But if it wasn't for me,\" says his brother, \"he'd think it was all right to go on a bender for three days and not see his kid. He'd think that was fine. He sees me and I'm, like, 'You're a disgrace.' It's for his own good. There's two sides to Liam: when he's pissed, he's fuckin' horrible, and I hate him, and I really mean that. I fuckin' hate him. It's just psychotic alcohol bullshit and I've got no time for him. When he's sober, he's a top geezer and you can have a rational conversation with him about anything.\" Rather sweetly, he adds, in his brother's defence, that it's a tall order to juggle the balls of rock-stardom and fatherhood, and that every so often Liam drops one of those balls, and that's when he goes on drinking binges. There's a track on the album written by Liam called Little James, about his stepson (Patsy's son by the singer Jim Kerr). \"It's a good song,\" says Noel. \"I wouldn't have let it be on the album otherwise.\"</p> <p>Noel asked his brother recently which Liam would be coming on tour with them this year. He told him that if it was the same Liam who came on tour in 1997 - \"with a beard and a stupid hat, blowing a stupid trumpet into his microphone\" - then it would be the last tour on which Noel would be joining him. If, however, it was the Liam that he knows and likes, then that would be fine. \"I just wanted to know what weapons to pack.\" Noel's worst nightmare is that somewhere in the middle of Texas, Liam will get drunk, start arguing, and the two new members of the band will bale out.</p> <p>He's optimistic, though. \"Everyone likes a drink and all that, but the chaos seems to have left, and I think we all know we're not some young punks any more. I don't like to say that we're responsible adults, exactly, but we want to put on a good show for the people who've bothered to come and see us after all these years.\" The remorse creeps back into his voice. \"We've made some bad mistakes in the past, and still, in England, if we put out one photograph we sell out two nights at Wembley Stadium. To me, that is fuckin' astonishing. And we're not going to fuck it up this time.\"</p> <p>It's perhaps no wonder that the Gallagher brothers are determined not to let their success slip through their fingers, nor that they went on a four-year bender when fame and wealth came their way. They had more reason to celebrate than most. Noel feels no nostalgia for his early years in Manchester. Out of his old friends, some are dead, some are in prison for drug-dealing or robbing, and a lot of them are \"average Joes\". He remembers going to his local, the Packhorse, on Friday nights. Everyone would stand around the pool table \"talking about who was hardest, City or United\". They are not romantic memories.</p> <p>For Liam, their brother Paul, and himself, life was no worse than for anyone else on his street, but, he says, the 80s were not a good time to be growing up. His unhappiest memories were of \"unemployment and desolation, growing up on the dole on \u00a317 a week. My Mam used to take half of it, and I'm glad she done it now. I come from fuck all and if I go back to nothing I'll have had a good trip.\" He won't be rushing back there, though. He still supports Manchester City, of course, but he gets agitated when Mancunians expect a more general sense of loyalty. \"I'm like, 'Get over it, we don't live here any more. It's just the place where I used to live.'\" When he goes there now, he says, he gets the sense of being a huge fish in a tiny fishbowl. \"I think I'd probably go insane up there. London's massive, and there are millions of famous people, so who gives a fuck.\"</p> <p>Of course, there's more to it than the grim surroundings. \"Home life was a bit of a pain in the arse,\" he says, more quietly, \"because my Dad was a typical Irishman, flying off the handle for any reason, and my Mam was a typical Irishwoman, always stood by him, even though we were always going 'leave him'.\" Peggy Gallagher waited until her sons had grown up, \"God bless her\", and then off she went. He hasn't seen his father for years. Does he think they will ever be reconciled? \"Never. I find it very hypocritical when he goes, 'my sons this, my sons that'. He doesn't even know us. He used to say that none of us would end up doing anything with our lives coz we were useless, coz we had no qualifications.</p> <p>\"If I went back to shake his hand and forgive him, that would condone everything he's done. He'd have got away with it. He's got to go to his grave knowing for a fact that I hate him and that Liam hates him and that my Mam doesn't want anything to do with him. He's got to fuckin' pay for his sins, man. Simple as that. Fuck him. He beat me up when I was kid. He actually physically had me on the floor, and I had black eyes because of him, up until I was 16, 17.\" His father has always denied this. But for Noel a reunion is off the cards. \"There's no fuckin' way. There's nothing that anyone can say to me like 'but he's your dad'. Big deal.\"</p> <p>Not that it was all doom and gloom. Learning to play the guitar in his teens was a happy time, he says, \"strumming away on the same three chords - a bit like now.\" And listening to the Smiths (\"Morrissey and Marr were like gods to me\"), seeing the Stone Roses play, going to raves in his 20s, and working as a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets. His happiest childhood recollections are not of Manchester, but of summer holidays in County Mayo, Ireland, where the boys and their mother stayed with their grandma for six weeks every year, living on the farm and making hay. \"My gran's got this house and the back garden is just fuckin' huge. The nearest neighbours are four miles away. She didn't have running water, so we went to the well to get water. It was back to basics. Those are my fondest memories.\"</p> <p>So fond, in fact, that he recently went to a sanctuary and acquired two donkeys, because they reminded him of his childhood summers in Ireland. At their Buckinghamshire home, Noel and Meg also have four cats, some geese, some goats and five dogs (two Dobermans, two Jack Russells and one mongrel they found abandoned in a shop doorway in Camden). He's hoping for a Staffordshire bull terrier for his birthday. Noel Gallagher? An animal lover? Who would have thought it. \"They're for the kids, really, when they get a bit older.\"</p> <p>Noel is now a three-pints-of-Guinness man (\"then I fall over\"). The couple threw a Boxing Day party at their country abode, and Noel thought that there were probably guests sneaking to the toilets for a quick coke fix. It didn't bother him, he says. He doesn't want to preach to anyone, it's just not for him any more. He says that, a few years down the line, when his kids get involved in the \"same shit that their mum and dad did\", that his experiences will help him understand. When he eventually sits down to have that father-son or father-daughter conversation about drugs, \"they'll understand that I've done it and that I'm not bullshitting them. When you're 24, and you're in one of the biggest bands in the world and you've got loads of money, you go mental. No one could have persuaded me then that, in six or seven years time, I was going to be lying in bed having a panic attack, getting the shakes. Life's for living.\"</p> <p>The money he's saved from the drugs is \"piling up in the bank\". Along with a Porsche, a Range Rover, a Jag and 400 pairs of vintage Adidas trainers (which take up a whole room in the house), the couple have recently acquired a house in Ibiza. \"Thinking 16 years ahead, our kids can go there and they'll be known on the island, they'll speak Spanish, the local police will know them - any trouble, their dad'll be over there.\"</p> <p>And if, in their 40s, he and his wife get their \"second wind\", they'll be in the prime spot for a bit of clubbing. \"We'll be the sad old gits at the back with our bottles of water who've forgotten how to dance,\" he says.</p> <p>The baby is in \"flight position\", and Noel has been told by Meg that he will be at the birth. \"I'm looking forward to the day after the birth. I've got a mental picture of the birth like some scene from The Exorcist with loads of swearing, people in masks, screaming, shouting, a smoke machine.\" His mother, needless to say, is ecstatic. \"It's like a bus: you wait 10 years for a grandchild, then two come along at once.\" All is well, it seems. He wants a girl, he says. \"Having two brothers and being in a band of five geezers, there are too many men in my life.\"</p> <p>Another thing he will make sure of, he says, is that his kids know how privileged they are. \"They won't grow up in a shitty council house with no money, but they'll have a pretty good idea what it's like, because I've been there.\" Recently, Noel was approached in the street by a fan asking for an autograph. He noticed that the boy was so over-awed that he was shaking. \"Calm down,\" he told him. \"We all shit in the same toilet. It's no big deal.\" The boy replied, \"But you are my god.\" To Noel, this was absurd. But didn't he once say that Oasis were bigger than God? \"I said we were bigger than God, but what I meant to say was taller. I believe Jesus was 5ft 7in and I'm 5ft 8 1/2 in,\" he smiles sheepishly. \"I still stand by that.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is released on February 28. Oasis's new single, Go Let It Out, is released on February 7.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just when was it that the glamour of Oasis first started to fade? When did their seductive supernova swagger cease to be sexy, and begin to seem graceless? Was it when a heavily bearded Liam Gallagher set upon an unsuspecting fan in Australia, breaking his nose? Or was it when even Liam's impeccable singing voice failed to disguise the fundamental pub-rock flavour of the band's third album? Somewhere along the line, a couple of years back, Oasis began to resemble a parody of themselves. Then, last year, to make matters worse, both the guitarist and bass-player suddenly walked away from the group, and were swiftly followed by the boss of the band's label. The glorious, giddy heights of Champagne Supernova and Wonderwall seem long gone, as are the days when the irreverent, hedonistic Gallagher brothers, boozing for England, could do no wrong: Noel and wife Meg partying at Downing Street; luscious Liam and pouting Patsy posing glossily under a Union Jack duvet on the cover of Vanity Fair's Swinging London issue, the sexy ubercouple - so much more fun than their usurpers, Posh and Becks. The Oasis party started in 1993 and continued pretty much unabated until 1997. They brightened the Major years, saw in New Labour and (What's The Story?) Morning Glory sold 12 million copies worldwide, topped only by the Spice Girls in the 90s. Not that their third album, Be Here Now, didn't sell. It did - six million copies, to be precise. It was not that Oasis had become less successful, just less fashionable - and less likeable. For Noel Gallagher, it was the 1997 world tour that did it. The nose-breaking incident in Australia was symptomatic. \"It just turned into a travelling piss-up,\" he admits now, as he sits sipping tea. \"Bonehead and Liam were just fuckin' out of control, and I was trying to keep everyone together and trying to explain that people had stopped talking about the music and were just talking about the bullshit that surrounded the band. But after about a month, I just gave up and thought, fuck it, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" It was not a great time for the band's public image: internationally, the view of them was \"a bunch of lunatics who come roaring through town drunk, smash the place up, play a couple of gigs and fuck off again. We did some shocking gigs on the last tour purely because we'd been out too much the night before. As soon as we put the instruments down, we'd go out and get absolutely shit-faced.\" He sounds almost repentant. I'd expected him to be sober (he'd recently declared his new, clean status), but I thought that he might be aggressive or arrogant. None of that. He's not what you'd call humble, exactly, but he's polite, friendly even. And in spite of what he fears may be the onset of flu (\"you know something's wrong when cigarettes start to taste bad\"), he looks rather well, all bright-eyed and clear-skinned. In spite of the band's downward spiral, something, it seems, stopped them from throwing it all away. They pulled themselves back from the brink of terminal self-indulgence and self-destruction, and have emerged from the chaos of the past few years with a new line-up, their own record label and an excellent new album, Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants. It's not a radical departure, and Noel's songwriting style remains the same, but Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is more subtle than its predecessors, more of a \"grower\", and sounds perceptibly more modern than the previous three albums. \"We needed a fresh inspiration from somewhere,\" says Noel. They enlisted Mark \"Spike\" Stent to co-produce with Noel. \"If there's one person who can embellish a rock'n'roll sounding band, then Spike's the man, because he's worked with U2, Madonna, Massive Attack and Bjourk, and he has one foot in the rock'n'roll camp and one in contemporary, electronic music. He'd always liked the band, but he thought that the records sounded crap, which was his opening line to us.\" The songs are more personal, and there is less of the Supersonic-style sloganeering. Noel stopped writing lyrics \"that just rhymed or sounded good. It's hard to write a really deeply personal song and then give it to someone else who's five years younger than you to express it down the microphone. But Liam's got to understand that, from now on, the songs are going to get more meaningful to me and probably less meaningful to him. And he'll understand as he gets older.\" The way Noel describes it, it's hard to know which was more insane, being on a deranged, drugs-driven world tour or being at home in London, where the party continued in much the same way. The new album is more about the comedown than the highs. Where Did It All Go Wrong? is a track written just before Noel and Meg, both now 32, moved out of Supernova Heights, their home in Belsize Park, north London. Their house had turned into a nightclub, he says, \"a pretty good one at that. The bar was always open, the door was always open, there were more people coming in and out than I ever got to know. I must have wasted years sitting there with the curtains closed talking about bullishit - aliens, pyramids, debating 'did they really land on the moon, let's watch the footage again in slow motion' or 'crop circles - what's that all about?'\" One morning, he looked in the mirror at his yellow skin and popping eyes, unable to focus, with a load of strangers in the kitchen, and thought, \"Oh fuck, how did we get here?\" Sunday Morning Call is about a particular person on a self-destruct mission, who is \"too rock'n'roll for their own good\". My guess is Kate Moss. \"Could be - she's one of my mates, but I wouldn't like to say who it's about.\" Did Noel never think of checking himself into the Priory, the usual drying-out route favoured by the rich and famous? \"I never understand people who spend \u00a350,000 a month to cure a \u00a310,000-a-month habit. And it creates another shit storm and a media circus, and people lie about why they're going in, and say they're 'stressed out'.\" Instead, Noel and Meg sold their London house and moved to Buckinghamshire. He took the phone off the hook and stayed in. Gas Panic, the new album's darkest track, was written while weaning himself off cocaine - \"going cold turkey, without wanting to sound too dramatic about it\" - in the midst of a night-time panic attack. \"It's basically a paranoid drugs song.\" Even when the house wasn't full of party guests, life then at Supernova Heights sounds nightmarishly reminiscent of the Burton-Taylor carousing years. A drugs-and-booze-fuelled Noel and Meg were rowing \"about fuck all. 'You said that to that person and they said that about me.'\" Finally, says Noel, \"I picked my missus up off the kitchen floor\" and the two of them set off on a month-long holiday to Thailand. \"We'd never really hung out together sober,\" he says. \"We met through drugs. Our relationship was surrounded by drugs. We got married when we were pissed. Though we weren't drunk when we decided to get married,\" he adds hastily. \"When I decided I was going to come off it and change the way I lived, in the beginning it was, like - how's that gonna be with our relationship. Am I still gonna like her?\" The holiday was a success, and he wrote the album's most uplifting track, the tranquil Who Feels Love, after a visit to a temple. \"It was the calm after the storm. I suppose I was feeling at one with the world.\" He had become \"re-acquainted\" with his wife. \"It was like, 'Yeah, she is cool',\" he says. \"'And I do actually like her. I love her.'\" Then, on their second wedding anniversary last year, Meg told her husband that she was pregnant, \"as luck would have it\", he beams (by the time you read this, the baby's arrival will be imminent). \"That gave us something else. You go on being young and having nothing to keep you grounded... I like that I'm not going to be able to let myself go any more, because I'm going to have to be there.\" It was good timing, for both of them. Without the pregnancy, it might have been harder for Meg to quit the rock'n'roll lifestyle, says her husband. \"Meg is hardcore, her and her fuckin' girlfriends are worse than any bunch of guys I've ever been out with.\" I find that hard to believe. \"I mean it, man,\" he says seriously. \"They are fuckin' hardcore rock'n'roll women. They can be a bit scary when they're out, actually,\" he smiles. \"She's easily led, that woman,\" he says, rather fondly, \"especially by mates who are 10 years younger than her. Meg always wanted kids, anyway, and I was, like, well, if it happens it happens, but I was over the moon that it did.\" When guitarist Bonehead and bass-player Guigsy left the band in August last year, Liam \"freaked out\", but Noel was philosophical about it. \"By their own admission, they weren't very good musicians,\" he says. They signed up rhythm guitarist Gem, formerly of Heavy Stereo, and bassist Andy Bell, formerly of Ride, to join the Gallaghers and drummer Andy White, and the new line-up made its debut in Philadelphia last December. The full world tour starts in Japan next month, ending up in the UK in July. Noel is equally sanguine about the departure earlier this month of Alan McGee, the boss of Creation who originally signed up the band on the spot at a small gig in Glasgow and who has left to set up an internet company. \"With two members leaving and then this, it looked like a big shit sandwich. But when you go to bed at night it's a crisis, and when you wake up in the morning it's just another problem to be solved.\" Liam was quoted as saying that he felt deserted by McGee, for whom the band had made around \u00a330 million. \"I know for a fact he just said that for effect, because I know he wasn't upset with Alan when he left. I dunno why he's saying he's broken-hearted because to be broken-hearted you have to have a heart, and he hasn't. He might think he does. He's got a soul, but he's not got a heart.\" Creation Records has now folded, and 30 staff were made redundant. Noel feels for them, but says, matter-of-factly, \"it's not the first record label that's folded, and it won't be the last . . . If it hadn't been for Alan, I wouldn't have signed off the dole. It works both ways. We made him a lot of money. He gave us the chance to make him a lot of money. He left us in a pretty decent position.\" The band have now set up their own label, Big Brother, though they remain under the auspices of parent company Sony. A large number of young Britons spent their formative years on the late-80s rave scene, a movement that sparked a tabloid moral panic - and one that was largely outlawed by the Tory government. For those people, hedonism and anti-authoritarianism went hand in hand. So, when Oasis appeared in 1993, extolling the virtues of drugs - \"like having a cup of tea\", as Noel famously phrased it once - and proudly displaying their working-class, anti-establishment credentials, it's no surpise that the \"chemical generation\" took to them. Like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses before them, Oasis tapped straight into the rebellious, feel-good moment. After he'd made the famous drugs-and-tea comment, Noel recalls returning to his previous home in St John's Wood to find his house surrounded by journalists and the street cordoned off. He went to a friend's place. There had been questions raised in Parliament, and the then Home Secretary, Michael Howard, was on television demanding that he be kicked out of the country. \"Two years later, I was arriving at Downing Street in a Rolls-Royce and thinking, 'I hope you're fuckin' watching this now.'\" His mum was very proud, he says, as was Meg's mother, a former trades unionist. \"And, of course, I was entirely convinced I was going to get a knighthood,\" he laughs. The post-victory euphoria was still tangible in Britain. Again in repentant mode, he says that he wished he'd called his Liverpool docker acquaintances the night before to ask if there was anything they wanted him to say to Tony Blair. \"But of course I went there for the infamy more than anything, and it was, like, 'You're top.' 'No, you're top.' 'No, you're fuckin' top.' 'Well, thanks a lot, here's a gold disc.'\" Whatever he may think of Blair now - he says he became disillusioned when the Government started \"taking money off single mothers and students\" - he's still glad that he went to Downing Street. \"Once. I wouldn't do it again.\" He concedes that Blair's spin doctors were using him to heighten New Labour's credibility, \"but we'd had 18 years of the fuckin' Tories drip-drying this country almost out of business. I'd voted Labour all my life.\" Oasis's laddish demeanour was also very of-the-moment in the early days. Back in 1993, Loaded magazine was soon to be launched, and \"lad culture\", though not to everyone's taste, had at least a new frankness and honesty about it. The band's brashness seemed emblematic of a shift in British male identity. The popular perception of Oasis is still steeped in drugs, violence and sex. Is that a good thing? Noel pauses for a moment. \"I can see that when we came along at the arse end of '93, it was Suede and all them lot, and we were, like, 'Right. They're shit. They're shit. You're fuckin' totally shit. Chop 'em out. Get us a fuckin' beer. Hello darlin'.' And the kids went berserk, because they were, like, 'that's me incarnate, how cool is that'. And the more people said it, the more we just went berserk. And we lived up to it for a while.\" Liam, although calmer nowadays, still does, off and on. He \"went missing\" for a few days last November, and the tabloids made the most of it. For Noel, such behaviour, even now, is not without its advantages: \"I was thinking, 'For fuck's sake, not again', but to some kid living in a council block in Glasgow, I bet he was going, 'You fuckin' go on, my son, you really don't give a fuck, Liam'.\" Episodes such as this - and Liam's scrape with the law for drugs possession a few years back - help Joe Public connect with the band, Noel believes. He can understand the media obsession with Liam and Patsy, he says. \"Rockstar. Headcase. Actress. Headcase. Little blonde chick, lunatic with a beard. I can see why people wonder what's going on behind closed doors.\" Patsy's recent comments in GQ magazine about the couple's sex life made front-page news in many of the tabloids. Not that Liam and Patsy have a monopoly on the column inches, of course. At one point, Noel was approached by the tabloids to comment on more or less any subject: the Royal Family, the Labour Party, other bands. \"They'd be, like, 'get someone round to Gallagher's house. He'll be up, he'll give you a quote'.\" And Noel would invariably oblige, usually drunk. \"I'd be, like, 'What? The French? What've they done? Nicking our fish? Fuck 'em! Fuckin' French! And I'd go into one.\" Nor has Meg exactly shunned the limelight. Her high public profile, frequently in Gucci, has added to the Gallaghers' seeming ubiquity. Unlike Patsy, who, since her days as the Bird's Eye peas girl, has been used to life in the public eye, celebrity was thrust upon Meg suddenly, and she embraced it. Her short-lived column in the Sunday Times, while curiously compelling, did little to enhance the band's mystique. Noel was not keen. \"I went fuckin' ballistic. We have heated debates about stuff like that. To me it was just celebrity name-dropping and it was wrong.\" But the paper was offering her \u00a350,000, and her party-organising business with friend Fran Cutler had not, at that point, taken off. \"She wouldn't want anyone to think that she sits at home all day, eating cream cakes and spending my money. She's her own woman. At the end of the day, we had to agree to disagree. I would never put my foot down and tell her what to do. She'd tell me to piss off.\" These days, \"lad culture\" has begun to look a bit tired. The Loaded ethos has been lifted and transformed by the wider men's magazine market, and the media generally, into something more ubiquitous and more cynical. For Oasis still to appear fresh, something more than a reputation for hell-raising is needed to justify their status, something more profound, and no one is more aware of that than Noel. But his approach is double-edged. On the one hand, he acknowledges that the mad-for-it melodrama helps people feel a connection with the band. On the other hand, he refuses to indulge his little brother. \"I'm the only person who'll tell it like it is. He has a lot of people who pussyfoot around him and say, 'He does this because of that'. Fuck him. He's 27. He's a millionaire. I'm not having it that his life is any worse than someone who's living in fuckin' Leicester, who's got two kids and no fuckin' job. I'm not having any of that shit.\" Liam doesn't always like hearing that, or reading it in print; it seems demeaning to him. \"But if it wasn't for me,\" says his brother, \"he'd think it was all right to go on a bender for three days and not see his kid. He'd think that was fine. He sees me and I'm, like, 'You're a disgrace.' It's for his own good. There's two sides to Liam: when he's pissed, he's fuckin' horrible, and I hate him, and I really mean that. I fuckin' hate him. It's just psychotic alcohol bullshit and I've got no time for him. When he's sober, he's a top geezer and you can have a rational conversation with him about anything.\" Rather sweetly, he adds, in his brother's defence, that it's a tall order to juggle the balls of rock-stardom and fatherhood, and that every so often Liam drops one of those balls, and that's when he goes on drinking binges. There's a track on the album written by Liam called Little James, about his stepson (Patsy's son by the singer Jim Kerr). \"It's a good song,\" says Noel. \"I wouldn't have let it be on the album otherwise.\" Noel asked his brother recently which Liam would be coming on tour with them this year. He told him that if it was the same Liam who came on tour in 1997 - \"with a beard and a stupid hat, blowing a stupid trumpet into his microphone\" - then it would be the last tour on which Noel would be joining him. If, however, it was the Liam that he knows and likes, then that would be fine. \"I just wanted to know what weapons to pack.\" Noel's worst nightmare is that somewhere in the middle of Texas, Liam will get drunk, start arguing, and the two new members of the band will bale out. He's optimistic, though. \"Everyone likes a drink and all that, but the chaos seems to have left, and I think we all know we're not some young punks any more. I don't like to say that we're responsible adults, exactly, but we want to put on a good show for the people who've bothered to come and see us after all these years.\" The remorse creeps back into his voice. \"We've made some bad mistakes in the past, and still, in England, if we put out one photograph we sell out two nights at Wembley Stadium. To me, that is fuckin' astonishing. And we're not going to fuck it up this time.\" It's perhaps no wonder that the Gallagher brothers are determined not to let their success slip through their fingers, nor that they went on a four-year bender when fame and wealth came their way. They had more reason to celebrate than most. Noel feels no nostalgia for his early years in Manchester. Out of his old friends, some are dead, some are in prison for drug-dealing or robbing, and a lot of them are \"average Joes\". He remembers going to his local, the Packhorse, on Friday nights. Everyone would stand around the pool table \"talking about who was hardest, City or United\". They are not romantic memories. For Liam, their brother Paul, and himself, life was no worse than for anyone else on his street, but, he says, the 80s were not a good time to be growing up. His unhappiest memories were of \"unemployment and desolation, growing up on the dole on \u00a317 a week. My Mam used to take half of it, and I'm glad she done it now. I come from fuck all and if I go back to nothing I'll have had a good trip.\" He won't be rushing back there, though. He still supports Manchester City, of course, but he gets agitated when Mancunians expect a more general sense of loyalty. \"I'm like, 'Get over it, we don't live here any more. It's just the place where I used to live.'\" When he goes there now, he says, he gets the sense of being a huge fish in a tiny fishbowl. \"I think I'd probably go insane up there. London's massive, and there are millions of famous people, so who gives a fuck.\" Of course, there's more to it than the grim surroundings. \"Home life was a bit of a pain in the arse,\" he says, more quietly, \"because my Dad was a typical Irishman, flying off the handle for any reason, and my Mam was a typical Irishwoman, always stood by him, even though we were always going 'leave him'.\" Peggy Gallagher waited until her sons had grown up, \"God bless her\", and then off she went. He hasn't seen his father for years. Does he think they will ever be reconciled? \"Never. I find it very hypocritical when he goes, 'my sons this, my sons that'. He doesn't even know us. He used to say that none of us would end up doing anything with our lives coz we were useless, coz we had no qualifications. \"If I went back to shake his hand and forgive him, that would condone everything he's done. He'd have got away with it. He's got to go to his grave knowing for a fact that I hate him and that Liam hates him and that my Mam doesn't want anything to do with him. He's got to fuckin' pay for his sins, man. Simple as that. Fuck him. He beat me up when I was kid. He actually physically had me on the floor, and I had black eyes because of him, up until I was 16, 17.\" His father has always denied this. But for Noel a reunion is off the cards. \"There's no fuckin' way. There's nothing that anyone can say to me like 'but he's your dad'. Big deal.\" Not that it was all doom and gloom. Learning to play the guitar in his teens was a happy time, he says, \"strumming away on the same three chords - a bit like now.\" And listening to the Smiths (\"Morrissey and Marr were like gods to me\"), seeing the Stone Roses play, going to raves in his 20s, and working as a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets. His happiest childhood recollections are not of Manchester, but of summer holidays in County Mayo, Ireland, where the boys and their mother stayed with their grandma for six weeks every year, living on the farm and making hay. \"My gran's got this house and the back garden is just fuckin' huge. The nearest neighbours are four miles away. She didn't have running water, so we went to the well to get water. It was back to basics. Those are my fondest memories.\" So fond, in fact, that he recently went to a sanctuary and acquired two donkeys, because they reminded him of his childhood summers in Ireland. At their Buckinghamshire home, Noel and Meg also have four cats, some geese, some goats and five dogs (two Dobermans, two Jack Russells and one mongrel they found abandoned in a shop doorway in Camden). He's hoping for a Staffordshire bull terrier for his birthday. Noel Gallagher? An animal lover? Who would have thought it. \"They're for the kids, really, when they get a bit older.\" Noel is now a three-pints-of-Guinness man (\"then I fall over\"). The couple threw a Boxing Day party at their country abode, and Noel thought that there were probably guests sneaking to the toilets for a quick coke fix. It didn't bother him, he says. He doesn't want to preach to anyone, it's just not for him any more. He says that, a few years down the line, when his kids get involved in the \"same shit that their mum and dad did\", that his experiences will help him understand. When he eventually sits down to have that father-son or father-daughter conversation about drugs, \"they'll understand that I've done it and that I'm not bullshitting them. When you're 24, and you're in one of the biggest bands in the world and you've got loads of money, you go mental. No one could have persuaded me then that, in six or seven years time, I was going to be lying in bed having a panic attack, getting the shakes. Life's for living.\" The money he's saved from the drugs is \"piling up in the bank\". Along with a Porsche, a Range Rover, a Jag and 400 pairs of vintage Adidas trainers (which take up a whole room in the house), the couple have recently acquired a house in Ibiza. \"Thinking 16 years ahead, our kids can go there and they'll be known on the island, they'll speak Spanish, the local police will know them - any trouble, their dad'll be over there.\" And if, in their 40s, he and his wife get their \"second wind\", they'll be in the prime spot for a bit of clubbing. \"We'll be the sad old gits at the back with our bottles of water who've forgotten how to dance,\" he says. The baby is in \"flight position\", and Noel has been told by Meg that he will be at the birth. \"I'm looking forward to the day after the birth. I've got a mental picture of the birth like some scene from The Exorcist with loads of swearing, people in masks, screaming, shouting, a smoke machine.\" His mother, needless to say, is ecstatic. \"It's like a bus: you wait 10 years for a grandchild, then two come along at once.\" All is well, it seems. He wants a girl, he says. \"Having two brothers and being in a band of five geezers, there are too many men in my life.\" Another thing he will make sure of, he says, is that his kids know how privileged they are. \"They won't grow up in a shitty council house with no money, but they'll have a pretty good idea what it's like, because I've been there.\" Recently, Noel was approached in the street by a fan asking for an autograph. He noticed that the boy was so over-awed that he was shaking. \"Calm down,\" he told him. \"We all shit in the same toilet. It's no big deal.\" The boy replied, \"But you are my god.\" To Noel, this was absurd. But didn't he once say that Oasis were bigger than God? \"I said we were bigger than God, but what I meant to say was taller. I believe Jesus was 5ft 7in and I'm 5ft 8 1/2 in,\" he smiles sheepishly. \"I still stand by that.\" \u0095 Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is released on February 28. Oasis's new single, Go Let It Out, is released on February 7.",

      "body": "<p>Most of the plants that flower in winter will do so far more freely if the preceding summer was long and hot. By the same token, those who live in London will get the clean end of the stick; those in the north and west the dirty end. Even in shade, a London garden is a lot warmer than sunshine in, say, Derbyshire.</p> <p>Winter sweet, Chimonanthus praecox, is just about the most rewarding winter shrub imaginable, if you can make a go of it. Its spicy fragrance has been the highlight of my garden since late November, but its wood must be well ripened if it is to make flower buds. Radiant heat - from, say, a south-facing brick wall behind it - will provide ideal conditions, but if your garden is reasonably warm anyway, then an open position may produce decent results once the plant is sufficiently mature to settle down to the business of flowering.</p> <p>The easiest way for the nurseryman to raise and offer winter sweet is as a seedling, but the juvenile condition of seedlings may last for six or seven years before there's a flower in sight. If you can secure a grafted plant of a named cultivar, propagated from an adult plant, juvenility will have been bypassed and it should flower quite quickly. 'Grandiflorus' and var.luteus are two such, both with the Award of Garden Merit. The latter has brighter yellow flowers than the rather dingily-coloured type-plant.</p> <p>Like many winter-flowering plants, winter sweet is an exceedingly dull bit of goods in summer, so don't make the mistake of placing it in a prominent position, if you can at all help it. Much better to cut branches from it at the key moment and enjoy it indoors in comfort.</p> <p>The same applies to the winter bush honeysuckle, Lonicera x purpusii, of which 'Winter Beauty' is allegedly the best clone. It will flower well in any open site and, given exposure, it will lose the last of its unsavoury leaves to autumn gales before its flowering gets into its stride. The heavily fragrant white flowers are remarkably frost-resistant. The shrub can grow huge, with masses of tired wood inside it. Far best, then, to thin this out every March. Young foliage will already be well developed by then, but don't let that worry you. Do your thinning before the foliage becomes too abundant to see what needs removing.</p> <p>The flowers of early rhododendrons are woefully susceptible to frost, but that doesn't stop me - or anyone else, for that matter - from growing them. The rich mauve, almost deciduous Rhododendron dauricum 'Midwinter' (AGM) opened its first buds with me on January 2. Always pick liberally for the house as soon as the buds colour. In this coming month there'll be a clear, pink-flowered hybrid, 'Seta', to cheer us, and that is ideal for picking. It makes quite a modest-sized shrub - but is of no interest in summer. No matter; that is not to be resented.</p> <p>From now on, forsythias will have received a sufficient winter chilling for us to be able to force their buds gently into flower indoors. (If picked prematurely, they won't oblige.) So, prune your forsythia now and benefit from the prunings inside. Again, it should be a question of opening the shrub up by thinning out old branches in their entirety, rather than making a hideous lump of it by clipping it over.</p> <p>In a hot London garden, you can get away with pruning an entire forsythia down almost to the ground after flowering. The young shoots thereafter, made during the summer, will ripen enough to flower the next winter. Under cooler conditions, however, they will be too soft and sappy to flower and will need another year in which to ripen. In the far north, forsythias really need to be grown as warm wall shrubs if they are to flower decently. Never mind, you Scots - there are many good plants that are far happier under your conditions than down south.</p> <p>The Algerian Iris unguicularis is a great favourite for winter flowering and for picking buds to open in the house (where they'll last for two or three days) during any mild spell from November to March. Their typically mauve petals have a sheen on them and seem far too fragile to be flowering at such a rough time of year. The plants, which need a nice hot position, are incredibly untidy and I am frequently asked what can be done about this without detriment to the next year's crop of blooms. There's really no straight answer. You can halve the foliage in spring, but I think that looks pretty awful, too. You can thin out the dead foliage leaving the rest intact, but that is quite a prolonged and tedious operation. More and more, I incline to doing nothing and to putting up with the mess in some discreet corner of the garden where it doesn't matter.</p> <p>A good reason for this inaction is that, if the flowerbuds have to push their way through a lot of debris to reach the light, their stalks are much longer and better for picking than they otherwise would be. When you pick, snap the stalk as low as you can, but do not pull. The buds are made in pairs and open in succession. If you pull, the second, immature bud will break off with the first, and you'll have lost it.</p> <p>I.unguicularis is easily raised from seed, which ripens near ground level (you have to look for it) in early summer. There are many strains of it around, some named, some not. 'Mary Barnard' is a rich, deep shade, and usually comes on in the New Year. 'Walter Butt' is one of the earliest, very pale and a little bit scented. The white variety is skinny and disappointing</p>",

      "bodyText": "Most of the plants that flower in winter will do so far more freely if the preceding summer was long and hot. By the same token, those who live in London will get the clean end of the stick; those in the north and west the dirty end. Even in shade, a London garden is a lot warmer than sunshine in, say, Derbyshire. Winter sweet, Chimonanthus praecox, is just about the most rewarding winter shrub imaginable, if you can make a go of it. Its spicy fragrance has been the highlight of my garden since late November, but its wood must be well ripened if it is to make flower buds. Radiant heat - from, say, a south-facing brick wall behind it - will provide ideal conditions, but if your garden is reasonably warm anyway, then an open position may produce decent results once the plant is sufficiently mature to settle down to the business of flowering. The easiest way for the nurseryman to raise and offer winter sweet is as a seedling, but the juvenile condition of seedlings may last for six or seven years before there's a flower in sight. If you can secure a grafted plant of a named cultivar, propagated from an adult plant, juvenility will have been bypassed and it should flower quite quickly. 'Grandiflorus' and var.luteus are two such, both with the Award of Garden Merit. The latter has brighter yellow flowers than the rather dingily-coloured type-plant. Like many winter-flowering plants, winter sweet is an exceedingly dull bit of goods in summer, so don't make the mistake of placing it in a prominent position, if you can at all help it. Much better to cut branches from it at the key moment and enjoy it indoors in comfort. The same applies to the winter bush honeysuckle, Lonicera x purpusii, of which 'Winter Beauty' is allegedly the best clone. It will flower well in any open site and, given exposure, it will lose the last of its unsavoury leaves to autumn gales before its flowering gets into its stride. The heavily fragrant white flowers are remarkably frost-resistant. The shrub can grow huge, with masses of tired wood inside it. Far best, then, to thin this out every March. Young foliage will already be well developed by then, but don't let that worry you. Do your thinning before the foliage becomes too abundant to see what needs removing. The flowers of early rhododendrons are woefully susceptible to frost, but that doesn't stop me - or anyone else, for that matter - from growing them. The rich mauve, almost deciduous Rhododendron dauricum 'Midwinter' (AGM) opened its first buds with me on January 2. Always pick liberally for the house as soon as the buds colour. In this coming month there'll be a clear, pink-flowered hybrid, 'Seta', to cheer us, and that is ideal for picking. It makes quite a modest-sized shrub - but is of no interest in summer. No matter; that is not to be resented. From now on, forsythias will have received a sufficient winter chilling for us to be able to force their buds gently into flower indoors. (If picked prematurely, they won't oblige.) So, prune your forsythia now and benefit from the prunings inside. Again, it should be a question of opening the shrub up by thinning out old branches in their entirety, rather than making a hideous lump of it by clipping it over. In a hot London garden, you can get away with pruning an entire forsythia down almost to the ground after flowering. The young shoots thereafter, made during the summer, will ripen enough to flower the next winter. Under cooler conditions, however, they will be too soft and sappy to flower and will need another year in which to ripen. In the far north, forsythias really need to be grown as warm wall shrubs if they are to flower decently. Never mind, you Scots - there are many good plants that are far happier under your conditions than down south. The Algerian Iris unguicularis is a great favourite for winter flowering and for picking buds to open in the house (where they'll last for two or three days) during any mild spell from November to March. Their typically mauve petals have a sheen on them and seem far too fragile to be flowering at such a rough time of year. The plants, which need a nice hot position, are incredibly untidy and I am frequently asked what can be done about this without detriment to the next year's crop of blooms. There's really no straight answer. You can halve the foliage in spring, but I think that looks pretty awful, too. You can thin out the dead foliage leaving the rest intact, but that is quite a prolonged and tedious operation. More and more, I incline to doing nothing and to putting up with the mess in some discreet corner of the garden where it doesn't matter. A good reason for this inaction is that, if the flowerbuds have to push their way through a lot of debris to reach the light, their stalks are much longer and better for picking than they otherwise would be. When you pick, snap the stalk as low as you can, but do not pull. The buds are made in pairs and open in succession. If you pull, the second, immature bud will break off with the first, and you'll have lost it. I.unguicularis is easily raised from seed, which ripens near ground level (you have to look for it) in early summer. There are many strains of it around, some named, some not. 'Mary Barnard' is a rich, deep shade, and usually comes on in the New Year. 'Walter Butt' is one of the earliest, very pale and a little bit scented. The white variety is skinny and disappointing",

Although, to be accurate, it came from the room the other side of the entrance hall.</p> <p>I was waiting for Jack and Cecily, who were doing a spot of Bumbrying, and had agreed to meet me at Homewood Park for dinner. Over the years, I'd been bombarded with regular bulletins as to the progress of its kitchen, and as to its one-Michelin-star status, achieved under the guidance of the present incumbent, Andrew Hamer. In the end, my nerve cracked and I thought I'd better see what was going on.</p> <p>I can't give you a detailed picture of the physiognomy of the place, having arrived after dark - as far as I could make out, the park was there all right, and the outlines of the house were handsome, but not grand. The welcome was pleasant and warm, and the interior done for bright good cheer. It all seemed pleasant enough without being exactly memorable. That goes for the dining room, too: it had the kind of decor that wasn't going to distract anyone from the business at hand.</p> <p>To judge by the menu, and its prices, that business was going to be quite serious. Was it to be pan-fried foie gras with shallot confit, pancetta and potato galette (\u00a314.50), followed by roast breast of Trelough duck with Anna potato, celeriac mousse and apple-and-ginger-scented sauce (\u00a325)?

There was also ravioli of spinach and Parmesan with leeks, wild mushrooms and rosemary- scented juices (\u00a312.50), and roast chump of West Country lamb with kidney, parsley and winter vegetables (\u00a324). You can see from the menu rubric, and the cost, that Homewood Park does not lack for ambition.</p> <p>In the end, Cecily settled for the foie gras, then pan-fried fillets of sea bass and scallops with aubergine, tomato and fennel (\u00a325); Jack for scallops and crispy veg, then lamb; and I for warm salad of mallard and celeriac, grain mustard and lentils flavoured with Sauvignon vinegar (\u00a313.50), followed by the beef. To drink, we began with a bottle of soft, honeyed Gew\u00fcrztraminer, which we started by the fire in the library, and then a bottle of Month\u00e9lie 1996 from the oddly perfunctory wine list that, nevertheless, had one or two goodies sorted away in its pages.</p> <p>I'll say one thing about Hamer's cooking: he doesn't stint on the bits and bobs on the plate. There's loads to look at and to eat. Take my mallard. Dead centre was a little wigwam of duck breast resting on a heap of celeriac remoulade. All around were splodges of lentils and splashes of sauce - all very Jackson Pollock - and little cubes of apple and, I think, more celeriac. It all tasted rather good: nice duck, lustrous and not too rank; decently mustardy remoulade; grainy lentils; fine, salty reduction sauce. Yes, all in all it added up rather satisfactorily.</p> <p>Not as satisfactorily, we all agreed after she had handed out generous sub-portions, as Cecily's foie gras, which was a star dish, rich, melting, sexy, seductive - the works. Jack reeled at the scale of his scallops and veg, but on closer inspection the scallops were on the button mushroom size and rather oversalted, he thought. He had no such reservations about the lamb, which came in a tower, slices perched precariously on top of one another, like the model of some medieval defensive outpost, and surrounded by vegetable out-buildings. In fact, each of our dishes came in a similar arrangement.</p> <p>In the end, our table looked like San Gimignano delle Belle Torre. But the tastes were there. My beef was a fine piece of meat, all coddled up with sauces of varying degrees of richness: a creamy mushroom sabayon and a rounded, fruity red-wine sauce, which rather put paid to any subtleties on the part of the truffle. And there were loads of turned vegetables to provide fibre and other healthy matters. Cecily's sea bass was an altogether lighter affair, with fine, piercing flavours and very good, crisp fish. Jack's lamb was more in the style of mine, a similarly hearty bolster against the winter chills.</p> <p>Cecily and Jack were blowing a bit by this time, and could manage only a plate of cheese between them. However, I was in training, and decided that I could manage a warm plum and frangipane tart with apricot ice cream, which I did very well, and enjoyed very much, as it was light and clean-flavoured, and carried that vaguely exotic perfume of ground almond. The cheese plate was something of a disappointment - four smallish slices of indifferent cheeses in indifferent states and heavily camouflaged by plate furniture. As Jack said, how much nicer one decent piece of well-kept cheese would have been.</p> <p>Cheese apart, this was industrious, sound, Michelin-class food, with industrious, sound flavours, which industriously delivered sound satisfaction all round. But at a price - the price being \u00a3215, including the two bottles of wine (at \u00a332 and \u00a338, respectively), water (\u00a35.50), and coffee and choccies (\u00a38), which left the food tiptoeing in at \u00a3131.50, or a shade over \u00a340 a head, which is quite heavy-hitting. But then, Homewood Park is aiming to be quite a heavy-hitting kind of place.</p> <p>As we lingered over coffee, the party of laughers, who had been dining in another room, passed by the door. Of course, it turned out that we knew one of the party well and we greeted each other with delight. It turned out that she had buried her father that day, and they decided to have a splendid dinner by way of affectionate celebration. I hope my friends and relatives do the same when I pop my clogs.</p>",

Jack's lamb was more in the style of mine, a similarly hearty bolster against the winter chills. Cecily and Jack were blowing a bit by this time, and could manage only a plate of cheese between them. However, I was in training, and decided that I could manage a warm plum and frangipane tart with apricot ice cream, which I did very well, and enjoyed very much, as it was light and clean-flavoured, and carried that vaguely exotic perfume of ground almond. The cheese plate was something of a disappointment - four smallish slices of indifferent cheeses in indifferent states and heavily camouflaged by plate furniture. As Jack said, how much nicer one decent piece of well-kept cheese would have been. Cheese apart, this was industrious, sound, Michelin-class food, with industrious, sound flavours, which industriously delivered sound satisfaction all round. But at a price - the price being \u00a3215, including the two bottles of wine (at \u00a332 and \u00a338, respectively), water (\u00a35.50), and coffee and choccies (\u00a38), which left the food tiptoeing in at \u00a3131.50, or a shade over \u00a340 a head, which is quite heavy-hitting. But then, Homewood Park is aiming to be quite a heavy-hitting kind of place. As we lingered over coffee, the party of laughers, who had been dining in another room, passed by the door. Of course, it turned out that we knew one of the party well and we greeted each other with delight. It turned out that she had buried her father that day, and they decided to have a splendid dinner by way of affectionate celebration. I hope my friends and relatives do the same when I pop my clogs.",

This was an enormous job, because it involved the manuscript and not just the text.</p> <p>All our knowledge of the poem descends from one manuscript currently in the British Library, which was burnt in a fire in a manuscript collection in 1736; so to establish the best text involved photographing every single page in exotic lightings to bring out obscured or damaged characters.</p> <p>Prescott was then, he says, the sort of historian who was in any case more interested in the confusions of the source material than the elegant reconstructions of narrative.</p> <p>\"I did research on medieval history, specialising in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. There are an enormous number of records of this in the public records office, which could not easily be presented in a conventional edition. For instance, in 1381 they burnt down the Savoy palace. There are records of the criminal cases that followed. But there was also subsequently private litigation and you can follow that and see which lawyers were involved in both cases.</p> <p>\"It's very much easier with computers. You can present more of the stuff for use by others. You can search it more easily and find things quicker. Then you can present it in new configurations, especially in the case of public record material where the inter-relationship is extremely complex. I suppose it's a medieval historian's version of what the credit card companies do to us all now.\"</p> <p>This interest of his is related to a wider resurgence of Anglo-Saxon studies on the internet which has led to some wonderfully useful things such as the construction of modern glossaries: we now know that if Beowulf had wanted to boot up his computer he would have called the process \"inspinninggehweorfastyrian\".</p> <p>Prescott is distant from the more frivolous end of these studies. After his doctorate, he went to work straight away at the library. It is easier to learn the specialised skills of a museum on top of a background as a professional historian than the other way around. But then he became enchanted by the transformations that technology can bring to even the oldest facts and the additional knowledge that can be gained from a text simply by looking at it on a screen.</p> <p>Because the original manuscript of Beowulf continued to deteriorate after the fire, each successive transcript of the poem was made by a scholar who could see less than his predecessors.</p> <p>\"If you are dealing with a literary text like this, and you have a series of 18th- and 19th-century transcripts, it's absolutely fantastic to compare what different scholars saw on screen.\"</p> <p>It is degeneration of this sort, he says, that is responsible for the story of Alfred burning the cakes. The only manuscript life of Alfred was destroyed in the same fire as damaged Beowulf. What remained were copies made earlier; and it is possible to see how one of the copyists inserted the story of the cakes simply because it was interesting.</p> <p>Prescott was part of the team that moved the manuscript collection to its new home in the British Library. \"Eight vans a day for six months: we must have seen close to a million items on to the shelves. They covered 7km of shelving end to end.\"</p> <p>How much would that take up as a tower of CD-roms? The answer, he says, is that it would be quite impossible. To preserve the kind of detail an illuminated manuscript deserves, the pictures have to be so detailed that you could only fit four pages on a CD. It is wonderful to realise that the skin from a sheep's stomach - for that is what vellum is made from - remains a better medium of information storage than anything we can manage with lasers.</p>",

Then you can present it in new configurations, especially in the case of public record material where the inter-relationship is extremely complex. I suppose it's a medieval historian's version of what the credit card companies do to us all now.\" This interest of his is related to a wider resurgence of Anglo-Saxon studies on the internet which has led to some wonderfully useful things such as the construction of modern glossaries: we now know that if Beowulf had wanted to boot up his computer he would have called the process \"inspinninggehweorfastyrian\". Prescott is distant from the more frivolous end of these studies. After his doctorate, he went to work straight away at the library. It is easier to learn the specialised skills of a museum on top of a background as a professional historian than the other way around. But then he became enchanted by the transformations that technology can bring to even the oldest facts and the additional knowledge that can be gained from a text simply by looking at it on a screen. Because the original manuscript of Beowulf continued to deteriorate after the fire, each successive transcript of the poem was made by a scholar who could see less than his predecessors. \"If you are dealing with a literary text like this, and you have a series of 18th- and 19th-century transcripts, it's absolutely fantastic to compare what different scholars saw on screen.\" It is degeneration of this sort, he says, that is responsible for the story of Alfred burning the cakes. The only manuscript life of Alfred was destroyed in the same fire as damaged Beowulf. What remained were copies made earlier; and it is possible to see how one of the copyists inserted the story of the cakes simply because it was interesting. Prescott was part of the team that moved the manuscript collection to its new home in the British Library. \"Eight vans a day for six months: we must have seen close to a million items on to the shelves. They covered 7km of shelving end to end.\" How much would that take up as a tower of CD-roms? The answer, he says, is that it would be quite impossible. To preserve the kind of detail an illuminated manuscript deserves, the pictures have to be so detailed that you could only fit four pages on a CD. It is wonderful to realise that the skin from a sheep's stomach - for that is what vellum is made from - remains a better medium of information storage than anything we can manage with lasers.",

      "bodyText": "Virgin Rail last night promised to act following mounting criticism from passengers that its standard return fare between Manchester and London has risen by 50% to \u00a3150 over the past three years. The company yesterday said that it was hoping to set up a special coach and charge around \u00a370 for a standard fare so long as the ticket is booked three weeks in advance. This follows pressure from passenger groups and a demand for an official inquiry into possible abuse of monopoly powers by Virgin. Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the rail passengers' watchdog committee for the north-west, has called on the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, to investigate \"the extortionate rail fares between London and the north-west\". Mr O'Friel said yesterday: \"People are being driven off the railways by Virgin's predatory pricing, in direct contravention of the government's stated aim of encouraging rail travel.\" Mr O'Friel, a former governor of Strangeways prison in Manchester, wants a government investigation into unregulated prices on the railways. \"There must be root and branch reform in the industry, so that there are additional powers to stop excessive price increases,\" he said. The shadow strategic rail authority, the body responsible for rail pricing, which is still awaiting final legislation, is powerless to do anything apart from controlling the 50-mile regulated fares area in London's commuter land, where some passengers have to pay almost \u00a34,000 a year for a season ticket. A spokeswoman for Virgin Rail said the company agreed that passengers had a point and that fares before 9.30am were too high, and said the company's senior managers were looking at a more equitable system and setting up a different fares structure. But Virgin was making a huge investment into the upgrading of the line and passenger improvement and the cost would have to be shared, she added.",

      "bodyText": "More than 6,000 Kurds who are seeking asylum in Britain now face deportation after a test case brought against the home secretary, Jack Straw, failed in the court of appeal yesterday. Three high court judges ruled that Mr Straw had acted properly despite hearing evidence that serious forms of torture were still rife in Turkey and Kurds who refused to serve in the army faced up to three years in prison followed by military service. The landmark appeal court ruling involved Abdullah Turgut, 30, who arrived in Britain in 1993 in the back of a lorry after fleeing from military conscription in Turkey. Lord Justice Simon Brown said that Mr Straw had made \"a reasonable decision\" in deciding that he should be deported and it was not up to the courts to review the evidence. The judge said it had not been an easy decision as \"many thousands of such claims for exceptional leave to remain in Britain\" were affected by the case. \"Despite the great wealth of material available to show that grave human rights abuses still regrettably occur in Turkey, and despite the lingering sense of unease which one must inevitably feel at the return of those like this applicant to Turkey, I am unable to hold that the secretary of state was bound to find the risk of this particular applicant being ill-treated a real one.\" Mr Turgut had challenged the home secretary's decision to deport him under article three of the European convention on human rights. The convention says that nobody should be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. His lawyers appealed to the court to make its own decision about the risk facing Mr Turgut if he was returned to Turkey. But Lord Justice Brown said the courts could never exercise powers as a \"primary decision-maker\" and usurp the role of the home secretary. He said that the home office had refused his application to stay in Britain on five separate occasions and found there were no grounds for believing he would be at risk if he was returned to Turkey. A second judgment in the appeal court yesterday, which could affect hundreds of other Kurdish asylum seekers, upheld the right of the home secretary to send another Turkish Kurd back to Germany and rejected the claim that it was not a safe third country. This case involved Abidin Altun, who refused to serve in the Turkish army on the grounds that he might be required to kill fellow Kurds. Mr Altun came to Britain after being refused asylum in Germany. It was also confirmed yesterday that a five-year-old London boy was being forced to leave Britain because his Kenyan mother had been refused political asylum. Patrick Wandia Njuguna, who was born in Britain five years ago and has not been out of the country, was served with deportation papers just before Christmas. His mother, Mary, 35, a nursery nurse, of Gospel Oak, north London, has been fighting to stay in Britain for more than five years. She fled Kenya after exposing a corrupt election commissioner while working for a Nairobi law firm.",

As Northern Ireland secretary, he was proving a class act.</p> <p>True, he was lucky to arrive at Stormont just as George Mitchell, the former US senator, was somehow mapping a way through the arms decommissioning impasse that had long threatened the Good Friday agreement. But it was Mr Mandelson who put the backbone into David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, as he hesitated over selling the compromise to his sceptical colleagues.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's halo slipped on his 101th day last week, when he announced he was backing the report by Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, on reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There were important, though scarcely noticed, concessions to Unionists, including postponement of district policing boards, which many fear would allow paramilitaries in some areas to wield undue influence.</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson's performance in several subsequent television interviews infuriated many Unionists, includ ing staunch supporters of the agreement.

      "bodyText": "Throughout his first 100 days back in government, Peter Mandelson's rehabilitation as a leading politician was easing effortlessly ahead. As Northern Ireland secretary, he was proving a class act. True, he was lucky to arrive at Stormont just as George Mitchell, the former US senator, was somehow mapping a way through the arms decommissioning impasse that had long threatened the Good Friday agreement. But it was Mr Mandelson who put the backbone into David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, as he hesitated over selling the compromise to his sceptical colleagues. Mr Mandelson's halo slipped on his 101th day last week, when he announced he was backing the report by Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, on reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There were important, though scarcely noticed, concessions to Unionists, including postponement of district policing boards, which many fear would allow paramilitaries in some areas to wield undue influence. But Mr Mandelson's performance in several subsequent television interviews infuriated many Unionists, includ ing staunch supporters of the agreement. They felt he was high-handed, even insulting. This weekend, his honeymoon is over. General John de Chastelain, chairman of the international commission on decommissioning, is on Monday to puncture earlier hopes when he will announce there has been no start to IRA decommissioning. Mr Mandelson faces the toughest decision of his ministerial career. Mr Trimble has to face his ruling Ulster Unionist council on February 12. He promised its 860 delegates in November that he and his three ministers would quit the executive if he was unable to report a start to IRA decommissioning at the reconvened meeting, and the announcement on the RUC leaves him no room for manoeuvre.

Denis Day, 55, sparked a fruitless clifftop search by police and coastguards after reporting his wife Ann missing. He later changed his story on a number of occasions and did not admit to his part in her death until four weeks ago when he was due to go on trial for murder. Ann Day, 47, died after falling on to rocks at Trewent point, one of the highest headlands on the Pembrokeshire coastal path, on April 14 last year. The family dog, a labrador named Jess, also went over the cliff. Swansea crown court was told yesterday that only Mr Day knew what really happened. The prosecution said it had no choice but to accept his denial of murder and plea of guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Sentencing was adjourned earlier this month pending probation reports, and Day, who had spent five months in jail on remand, was bailed to live with his late wife's mother, Joan Bingham, until yesterday's hearing. Mrs Bingham, a humanities teacher at Pembroke school, was not in court to hear her son-in-law sentenced. The court heard that the Days' 24-year marriage had turned into a \"shell\" and that Mrs Day, deputy head of Barn Street primary school in Haverfordwest, had been having an affair with a fellow teacher, Wayne Davies. On the day she died Mrs Day had spent the afternoon with her lover before suggesting a clifftop walk with her husband to \"clear the air\" over the divorce. Leighton Davies QC, prosecuting, said that after Mrs Day fell from the clifftop Day drove to Haverfordwest and withdrew money from a cash machine before returning home and telling the youngest of the couple's three teenage sons that his mother was missing. He waited 90 minutes before telephoning police and telling them his wife had not returned from a walk to meet him as planned. Two days later Day changed his story and claimed that the family's pet labrador had jumped up and knocked her over the edge of the cliff. He said he had made up the first story in panic. Mr Davies told the court that Day persisted with the charade through four police interviews until he was about to go on trial for murder.

      "bodyText": "The gale force winds and occasional blasts from the foghorn can be a bit of a problem, but as a spectacular water feature, the garden takes some beating. One of the most isolated homes in Britain is up for sale - at \u00a3200,000. Those determined not to be deterred by the experiences of volunteers for the BBC Castaway 2000 project could find the tiny island of Buchaness a tempting prospect. The rocky outpost comes complete with lighthouse and three more conventional homes. Anyone wishing to buy the island, however, should beware: Buchaness is cut off at high tide. But, when the weather is kind enough to allow com muting, the nearest town is five minutes away. For the past 11 years the island has been home to doctors Gordon and Avril Barratt. They warned yesterday that, although it has been a perfect home to them, it may not suit everyone so well. \"People have got to accept this place for what it is - you get good weather and bad weather. \"You have to take it in all weathers. Some people would like that and we have thoroughly enjoyed it,\" said Mrs Barratt, a forensic psychiatrist. The couple bought the island when the Northern Lighthouse Board was selling a number of its coastal properties. Buffeted by the worst storms of the North Sea, the distinctive lighthouse, with its red stripe, has since 1827 guided sailors into the Aberdeenshire port of Peterhead. The lighthouse is still operational and the lighthouse board has access to the island to maintain it, though it is now fully automated. Its loud foghorn has annoyed some neighbours, but the Barratts have grown used to it. \"The foghorn only goes off in deep mist. It is simply not a problem. \"If you live on the Embankment in London you have to contend with the noise of traffic and that sort of thing,\" said Mrs Barratt. The property actually comprises three houses - two of which were built by the lighthouse board for its staff in 1825. There is also a large modern four bedroom bungalow. All the buildings are shielded from the weather's worst excesses by a high wall. The lighthouse, which became fully automated in 1988, was built in 1827 to an engineering design by Robert Stephenson.

One of Wyner's managers, John Brock, 49, who was jailed for four years after being convicted of the same offence, was also given leave to appeal against his sentence but not his conviction. A spokesman for the Winter Comfort charity said last night: \"We are very, very disappointed by this ruling because we feel that their convictions are wrong - although we obviously welcome the granting of leave to appeal against sentence.\" Supporters of Wyner and Brock have launched a campaign for their release. The key issue at their trial at Kings Lynn crown court last year was whether Wyner and Brock had a duty to inform on hostel residents they knew to be dealing in drugs. Both argued they had a duty of confidentiality. Police said the Cambridge hostel had become a centre for drug dealing and that Wyner and Brock had turned a blind eye. Winter Comfort officials said the decision could have wide implications for people working with the homeless and with drug addicts.",

      "bodyText": "The parents of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence are to sue the Metropolitan Police for more than \u00a3500,000 for the way they were treated during the failed investigation into the racist killing of their son. They are also claiming for psychological damages, the cost of their son's funeral in Jamaica, and for the cost of the campaign to achieve some kind of justice for Stephen. Neville and Doreen Lawrence also plan to sue the five white youths who they believe killed Stephen, 18, in Eltham, south-east London. The couple lodged writs for damages at the high court in April last year, but the details of their claim has only been recently revealed, 11 months after an independent inquiry report harshly criticised the police investigation into Stephen's murder. Using the race relations act as the backbone for their claim, the couple - who have divorced since the murder of their son - have asked for \u00a3500,000 in total from the 41 officers involved in the inquiry into the killing of Stephen on April 22, 1993. The outgoing Metropolitan Police commissioner Paul Condon is one of those being sued. The couple are also suing the Met for negligence for an additional, undisclosed sum. Mrs Lawrence, 46, is claiming \u00a322,352 in damages for the detrimental effect the bungled police investigation had on her studies at Greenwich university in south London. Her writ also asks for \u00a37,000 to pay for trips she took to America and South Africa to try and get over the murder and for \u00a34,900 for visiting Stephen's grave in Jamaica. The writ also requests the cost of taxi fares to take her son Stuart to his part-time job at McDonald's - a cost of \u00a32,189. It is claimed he could not take public transport because the whole family was under the witness protection programme at the time. Other elements of Mrs Lawrence's claim include: \u0095 \u00a38,736 for four years of help looking after the other Lawrence children, Stuart and Georgina, during the police investigation \u0095 \u00a33,900 for phone bills \u0095 \u00a32,800 to cover expenses when the family moved home \u0095 \u00a318,960 for travel expenses \u0095 \u00a398,898 for loss of earnings due to the psychiatric damage of police negligence. Mr Lawrence has claimed \u00a38,000 for the cost of the funeral and is also seeking compensation for loss of earnings. Neil Acourt, 24 at the time, his brother, Jamie, 22, David Norris, 23, Luke Knight, 22, and Gary Dobson, 24, were all charged with Stephen's murder but the charges were dropped because of lack of evidence. The Lawrences' writs against the five suspects are unlikely to yield concrete damages as they are not wealthy. But a court case would oblige the five to account for their movements on the night of the murder in a court. A Met spokesman said: \"We can confirm we have received a claim of compensation for negligence from solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Lawrence.

      "body": "<p>As Birmingham prepares to demolish its most infamous landmark, the brutalist Bull Ring shopping centre, the go-ahead is expected on a site nearby for what will be the city's boldest project so far: Britain's tallest building.</p> <p>The regeneration minister, Beverley Hughes, said this week that the environment secretary, John Prescott, will announce next month whether the city council and a developer can go ahead with the \u00a3350m Arena Central project.</p> <p>At the heart of the 14-acre redevelopment is a plan for a 50-storey skyscraper a few feet higher than the 777ft Canary Wharf tower in London's docklands.

      "bodyText": "As Birmingham prepares to demolish its most infamous landmark, the brutalist Bull Ring shopping centre, the go-ahead is expected on a site nearby for what will be the city's boldest project so far: Britain's tallest building. The regeneration minister, Beverley Hughes, said this week that the environment secretary, John Prescott, will announce next month whether the city council and a developer can go ahead with the \u00a3350m Arena Central project. At the heart of the 14-acre redevelopment is a plan for a 50-storey skyscraper a few feet higher than the 777ft Canary Wharf tower in London's docklands. It has won the backing of most Brummies, including the Labour council. \"We are confident that Mr Prescott will respond to the overwhelming support for this regeneration project,\" said Martin Field, of the developers Hampton Trust, yesterday. Local planners, anxious to go one better than rival cities, urged the developer to think big, and abandon the original idea of a modest 25-storey tower. \"This is a statement Birmingham is going to have to make about its future,\" said Albert Bore, the leader of the city council, confidently. The developer is certainly not selling Arena Central short. It talks of Birmingham preparing to take its place among the world's great landmark cities with an \"internationally renowned development of unquestionable architectural stature\" that would take its place on the international stage alongside the Sydney opera house, the Eiffel tower, and the Empire State building. The senior architect, Pierre Baillargeon, from the international practice HOK, said the proposed design had broken away from a conventional, box-like structure with a \"very sculptural form, triangular with a slight rounded inflection. \"Consequently, it's a bit more slender than you usually see ... and a very strong landmark ... a very powerful icon that will bring identity to the city,\" he added. Dwarfing surrounding buildings, it will be seen from at least 20 miles away as a spacecraft-style structure topped with a long spike - handy, perhaps, to make Arena Central marginally taller than its rival in London. The building will be the first \"mixed use\" skyscraper in Europe - incorporating offices, an hotel, flats, and penthouses. Other tall buildings, such as Canary Wharf and Commerzbank's 981ft extravaganza in Frankfurt, are invariably office blocks. Mr Field denied that his project represented a race for the sky. \"Obviously, everyone wants to say it is going to be taller than Canary Wharf,\" he smiled. \"Everyone in Birmingham would love it to be taller... they feel they have been second best for too long.\" He believed that Arena Central, which will also incorporate a plaza, shops and entertainment, and lots of water below a big glass roof, would be a match for London. \"We're creating a new urban living and working quarter, Covent Garden and Leicester Square rolled into one, and a new heart for the city. \"At present Birmingham doesn't have a central quarter where you can say 'It's all happening'.\"",

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the prime minister denies the widely held view among Labour MPs and supporters that his government is running into trouble with voters because it stuck too tightly to spending plans inherited from the Tories in 1997. \"How many times do people want to learn the lessons of Labour history? The reason why the economy is performing well is not luck or chance. It is because we took major decisions to make it perform well,\" he says. That has not only meant policy changes such as independence for the Bank of England: it has meant building trust and credibility and not \"increasing spending one year and cutting it the next\" - as previous Labour governments were forced to do. Pledging himself to a radical election manifesto that will deliver improvements \"in a quicker and more effective way\" if he is re-elected, Mr Blair also rejects claims that his managerial administration lacks an inspiring big idea. He insists that his vision of an economically efficient and socially just society is a \"pretty big message\" to inspire the support of restless activists. Wary of specific pledges after last week's \"aspiration\" to raise NHS spending to EU average levels by 2006, Mr Blair argues: \"Despite short-term difficulties caused by tight spending policies for two years, I really promise people in the Labour party that it is better for us in the long term.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It begins with the discovery of an unaddressed, unstamped envelope in the morning post at an east London house. The owner, who we shall call Peter, picks it up, thinking it is just more unsolicited junk mail. It reeks of cheap perfume. Inside, is a handwritten letter that begins, \"Dear Ewen...\" It reads like a teenage love letter to a famous person. There is no clue as to the sender's identity, save for an illegible signature. Peter assumes that it has been put through the wrong letterbox; he throws it aside and forgets all about it. A few days later, another hand-delivered letter arrives. Again, it smells heavily of perfume and begins, \"Dear Ewen...\" Intrigued now, Peter compares it to the first letter: same handwriting, same scrawled signature. This time, however, there is a marked difference in the tone, which is more plaintive, forlorn even, the writer pleading for a meeting with her object of desire. Peter studies the signature; he thinks it reads \"Angel\". </p> <p>Over the next few weeks, the letters keep arriving, fitfully at first, then virtually every day. Peter's initial bemusement turns to anger - his wife, Joan, is eight months pregnant, and the last thing they need is some nutter bombarding the house with letters to someone who doesn't even live there. Peter keeps watch at various times, but never catches sight of anyone loitering near the house. Then, one day, a bunch of flowers and another letter are put through the letterbox. A few nights later, Joan is awoken by the sound of a tremulous female voice reciting a poem - or it might be a prayer? - outside. It is 3am. She wakes Peter. As he stumbles to the window, they hear the sound of footsteps scurrying away. </p> <p>Joan is now spooked, and finds it hard to be alone in the house. Peter takes the next day off work and, in the afternoon, sees a young woman hanging around on the corner opposite. He runs down into the street, but she has disappeared. Nothing happens for a few days, but it soon starts up again: irregular letters, flowers, all usually delivered in the dead of night. Once, Peter brings some flowers of his own home to cheer up his wife. He places them in a vase by the window. That night, he finds a note in his hall: \"I saw the sign you left in the window for me. I know you want me.\" Peter says nothing to his wife, but, before going to bed, he snatches up the pile of letters and throws them into the street. It makes him feel better. Until morning, that is, when they are again piled up in the hallway. Furious now, he throws them in the bin. Then he does what he should have done weeks before. He calls the police. </p> <p>\"It sounds stupid,\" Peter says now, \"but, for a long time, I didn't take it seriously. There are a lot of benign nutters on the streets. I guess I thought it would just stop.\" A policeman duly calls and tells them that he'll keep an eye on the house, but that there is not much more that the police can do without hard evidence and Peter, ironically, has destroyed it. </p> <p>A few days later, alone in the house, Joan is woken from an afternoon nap by the cat leaping on to the bed beside her. Instinctively, she reaches out to stroke it. She recoils at once: in its mouth, the cat is carrying a pair of blood-stained knickers wrapped in a pink bow. Joan freaks out and runs out of the house. Distraught, she rings Peter from the high street. She refuses to go home. Peter rings the police again and \"goes ballistic\". It works. \"I don't know if they just didn't believe me before, but as soon as they saw the knickers everything changed. We were interviewed by a very attentive and sympathetic woman PC. By now, though, I was at the end of my tether. I just wanted this deluded woman out of my life.\" </p> <p>For a while, it seems as if his wish had been granted. There are no letters, no flowers. Peter organises a rota of friends to drop by to keep Joan company. Then, one morning, when she is expecting a neighbour to call, she opens the door to a stranger. A young, heavily made-up woman pushes past her into the house, oblivious to Joan's protests. She disappears up the stairs, leaving in her wake a familiar scent. Joan freezes. She can hear the bath being run upstairs and, unbelievably, the stranger singing merrily to herself. Joan grabs her mobile phone and runs into the street, where she rings first the police and then her husband. By the time Peter arrives home, police and paramedics are trying to coax a half-naked young woman down off the roof terrace. Except that she is not a young woman at all, but a young man in drag. He/she is eventually sedated and carried out of Peter's house on a stretcher. It feels like the end of a nightmare. </p> <p>Although the names and location have been changed, this is the record of a recent stalking that lasted about three months. I know all about it not through journalistic investigation but because it happened to friends of mine. At one of the happiest moments of their life - the birth of their first child - their world was thrown out of kilter by a stranger who, without the slightest evidence, had become fixated on the idea that a celebrity lived in their house. It would be absurd - laughable, even - were it not so frightening. \"It's strange,\" Peter tells me when things no longer seem so fraught, so unremitting, \"but she seemed to be stalking the house, rather than us. I suppose she probably never meant us any harm.\" I nod reassuringly, but, deep down, I'm thinking, who knows? Who knows what someone that deluded and that obsessive might be thinking? Or, indeed, might do? </p> <p>When I first heard about Peter's predicament, I thought that, maybe, I could find out. My plan was to hang around near Peter's house until I saw this irrational individual push a letter or flowers through the letterbox, then, in true investigative fashion, I would confront him/her, and demand to know what he/she thought he/she was playing at. That would have been a big mistake. </p> <p> Why? Listen to Lorraine Sheridan, a psychologist at Leicester University, who has been collating statistical data on stalkers' victims: \"Stalkers are often obsessional and deluded,\" she says. \"To think that you can talk to them rationally about what they are doing is also deluded. Simply going up to a stalker in the street and asking them to explain themselves would probably be fruitless and, more to the point, could well be dangerous. First up, you are giving them attention, which, in their eyes, could well be a kind of vindication of their behaviour. Second, the stalking of a particular individual often stops only when the stalker becomes attached to someone else, usually someone who has given them attention.\" </p> <p>Or there's the testimony of Dr Edward Petch, a forensic psychologist who works in the secure unit of Ealing Hospital and who has seen more than his fair share of disturbed individuals. \"I deal with mentally-disordered offenders from the more violent end of the spectrum: murderers, rapists, sometimes multiple killers,\" he says. \"But, in terms of my own safety, it's the stalkers who keep me awake at night. I find myself worrying about what they are capable of, and the degree of their disturbance, trying to establish what it is that is driving them. There is often a separate quality to them, an inability to acknowledge that what they are doing is wrong, or to see the effects it is having on their victims. That is quite chilling.\" </p> <p>In terms of media attention, stalking is the crime of the moment. It is also, despite the recent deluge of cases concerning ordinary individuals, fixed firmly in the public consciousness as a crime against celebrities. Writing in this paper last year, the psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud claimed provocatively that having a stalker was the ultimate fashion accessory. I doubt that Monica Seles (stabbed by G\u00fcnther Parche, who had a long-term obsession with Steffi Graf) or Madonna (stalked for five years by Robert Dewey Hoskins, who threatened to slice her \"from ear to ear\" unless she married him) would agree with him. </p> <p>Sometimes, the media reports have a surreal element: the weatherman, Bill Giles, stalked by his own niece; the actor, Michael J Fox, pestered by a fan who sent him more than 5,000 letters, usually filled with rabbit droppings; Klaus Wagner, who followed Princess Diana to protect her from a \"Satan conspiracy\" supposedly waged against her by the Queen - \"Elizardbeast, we are 666 of you\" read one of his many bizarre placards. More often, however, the stories confirm Petch's conclusion that there is something uniquely chilling about stalkers and their methods: the widow of murdered headmaster, Philip Lawrence, stalked by a stranger wearing a hood; Ulrika Jonsson, bombarded with obscene phone calls and nude photos by Peter Casey, who threw himself under a train after police questioning; Lady Helen Taylor, stalked by Simon Reynolds, who also committed suicide. A few weeks ago, 30-year-old Jeremy Dyer was jailed for two-and-a-half years for stalking TV newsreader, Sarah Lockett - his campaign included bombarding her with 80 obscene letters, two of which alluded to the recent death of another newsreader, Jill Dando: \"I think the whole Jill Dando thing is great. I was hoping a celebrity would be murdered by a stalker, and it makes it even better that she read the news.\" </p> <p>Some experts, Petch among them, even claim that our society inadvertently encourages stalking, whether through the pursuit of the famous by the tabloids and the paparazzi - remember, for instance, the short-lived debate about whether Princess Diana was stalked to death? - or in the more collusive intrusions in magazines such as Hello! and OK!. Here, a carefully staged intimacy is sold to the highest bidder, often by those same stars who bemoan media incursions into their privacy. \"Those magazines peddle a kind of titillation,\" says Petch. \"If you see a star stretched out on her bed in her house, you can fantasise that you know her intimately because you know what her bedroom looks like. Those kind of images foster a false sense of intimacy and even identification. The fan-celebrity relationship is a very confused one in our society because we are encouraged to think that we know so much about the famous when, in effect, we know very little.\" </p> <p>So, on one quite complex level, a celebrity, as defined in the pages of Hello!, say, is a stranger whom we think we know; a stranger, what's more, who encourages our gaze, whose very being is tied up with our fascination with them. Is it any wonder, then, that celebrities often attract strangers who are convinced that, should the object of their devotion simply meet them, a bond will immediately be formed, a special intimacy born? When this turns out not to be the case, fan worship often mutates into a different, darker kind of obsession. Steven Spielberg is only one of many celebrities who have had to seek court restriction orders to deal with obsessive fans whose fascination seems somehow linked to fantasies of revenge and punishment. Spielberg's stalker, who on one occasion tried to ram the security gates of the director's Malibu home, was recently apprehended lurking near the house. In his car boot, the police found handcuffs, industrial adhesive tape, a knife and a collection of syringes. </p> <p>Stalking might appear to be a quintessentially contemporary crime, a phenomenon linked to our culture's collective and seemingly insatiable obsession with the minutiae of the celebrity lifestyle. In fact, the activity is neither new, nor is it a crime more likely to happen to the famous than to those engaged in more \"ordinary\" careers - though some evidence suggests that certain professions attract an above-average degree of stalkers, including, perhaps predictably, actors and politicians and, perhaps surprisingly, doctors. </p> <p>\"Stalking has probably been going on for hundreds of years,\" says Petch. \"It seems like a recent phenomenon probably because our ability to detect it has improved of late. That said, most cases involving ordinary people don't come to the attention of the courts at all, either because the stalkers haven't broken any laws - standing on a corner or sending flowers is not breaking the law, necessarily - or the stalker is convicted for some single thing that they have done in the course of their stalking, maybe breaking-and-entering or making an obscene phone call, and it's not recorded as a crime of stalking. I'd say it is probably a lot more prevalent than we think.\" </p> <p> Petch's overview is borne out by the increasing number of cases that are reported in the press concerning ordinary people who, without recourse to the kind of security and protection that celebrities can afford, often undergo prolonged ordeals of the most nightmarish kind. My friends' experience, though intrusive and frightening, was a relatively low-level persecution compared with some recently reported incidences: the dental nurse, Perry Southall, who was stalked by Clarence Morris, a convicted rapist, for eight months and endured 200 incidents of harassment; 13-year-old Maria Cross, who was followed relentlessly by unemployed loner Stephen Gomes; David Greenhaulgh, who was obsessively pursued by Anita Hall (when she was prevented from entering his workplace, she poured petrol over two receptionists and tried to set them alight). </p> <p>A 1977 survey carried out by NOP Solutions found that 19% of women and 8% of men in the UK had experienced threatening behaviour of the kind associated with stalking; that 25% of all respondents said that they knew someone who had been a victim of stalking, either face to face or through persistent phone calls. In the US, meanwhile, an estimated 8% of women have been stalked at some time, more than 1 million women are stalked annually, and an estimated one in six of women murdered each year have first been stalked. </p> <p>Stalking is a crime that, as Peter and Joan found out, often begins without motive, escalates in occurrence and in intensity, and, in many cases, continues for years rather than months. Many of the recorded stalkings in the UK have lasted between five and seven years, though Lorraine Sheridan at Leicester University told me of one woman she had uncovered in her research who had been stalked for 40 years. \"Research about stalking is still in its infancy,\" says Petch, \"so there is not a lot we can say with absolute certainty about the activity. Except this: stalking persists.\" </p> <p>In the shorter Oxford English Dictionary, stalking is defined simply as \"walking cautiously or stealthily. Pursuing a quarry or game by stealthy approach, especially undercover.\" The stalking of human quarry, however, is an activity that resists such easy definition. Australian psychologists, Michele Pathe and Paul Mullan, who have studied the subject, write: \"Stalking describes a constellation of behaviours in which one individual inflicts on another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications. The intrusions can involve following, loitering nearby, maintaining surveillance and making approaches. The communication can be through letters, the telephone, electronic mail, graffiti, or notes attached, for example, to the victim's car... Specific or implied threats to the safety of the objects of these attentions may be made, and physical and sexual assaults may also occur. Third parties, including friends and relatives of the victim, may also attract threats and violence from the stalker.\" </p> <p>Finding a workable legal definition has proved more difficult. In the US, it was the burgeoning threat to celebrities from stalkers that brought about Section 646, Part 9, of the Californian Penal Code, which defines a stalker as \"any person who wilfully, maliciously and repeatedly follows and harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety\". To date, 29 states have implemented stalking laws, and Los Angeles - where else? - has set up a Police Threat Management Unit specifically to deal with the crime. </p> <p>The US definition has proved problematic not least because it requires proof of intent and, thus, puts the onus on the victim. Ironically, many stalkers have no intention of harming their object or, indeed, any understanding of the harm they are causing. (One of the most common delusions that prompts stalking is erotomania, which, put simply, is the false belief that someone else loves you, when there is no evidence to support that belief. Erotomaniacs make up about 10% of all stalkers and, as Petch points out, \"their misguided belief in the certainty of their cause is a classic illustration of the folly of including the notion of intent in the law\".) </p> <p>The case that changed the law in the UK concerned Tracey Morgan, who was stalked by Anthony Burstow, a casual acquaintance, for seven years. Burstow was someone whose sole intention was to cause severe distress. \"I wanted to muck around with her head,\" he told the police. \"That's what this is all about.\" His sustained campaign of terror included threatening phone calls and letters, veiled death threats, constant surveillance of her house, pouring oil on her car, covering her lawn with condoms, sending her sanitary towels in the post and breaking into her home to plant listening devices in the bedroom. When the police arrested him, they found a vast collection of medical paraphernalia in his house, including syringes, needles, a blood-transfusion kit and details of his future plans, which included sending her spiders and snails through the post. </p> <p>In a recent television documentary, I'll Be Watching You, Morgan summed up the mental and physical cost of this harassment thus: \"In a cruel and arbitrary way, I was isolated and rendered unable to function properly. I was simply destroyed by someone who was fixated on me, and left bewildered, frightened and without any real protection.\" </p> <p>The ordeal cost Morgan her health, her house (she moved cities three times) and her marriage, but, in the end, through sheer force of will, she triumphed by going public and illustrating the huge gap in the law that allowed all this to happen. In 1996, Burstow was the first person ever to be charged with Grevious Mental Harm. He was found guilty and jailed for five years. Still, his persecution of Morgan continued: from his cell, he sent her an elaborate crossword puzzle wherein each clue referred to private, often intimate, information about her family; and later, while still in prison, he was arrested for soliciting to murder after guards found out that he had approached fellow criminals offering them \u00a33,500 to kill Tracey's husband-to-be. </p> <p>The year after Burstow's conviction, the government controversially pushed through the Protection From Harassment Act, a carefully-worded, wide-ranging piece of legislation that, though created to deal with the problem of stalking, studiously avoided using the term at all, so complex were the problems of definition. Sheridan, in her research paper, Stalking: Perceptions And Prevalence, points out that, even though the law was passed, \"a legal definition of stalking was never provided, and no accepted definition of stalking currently exists\". </p> <p>The two main concerns about the act's enforceability are that it does not clarify what, exactly, constitutes the criminal act of stalking, and that it does not distinguish between the dangerous stalker and what one expert calls \"the misguided fool wallowing in the anguish of betrayal\". Surprisingly, much of the press reaction to the act concentrated on the possible effect it might have on what one writer called \"persistent suitors\", rather than on the protection of the victim. Mary Kenny, for instance, writing in the Express, claimed that, \"Women are being turned into powerless, infantile victims encouraged to cry, 'Ma, he's making eyes at me!' and run for the protection of the State to deal with every vexatious private encounter... Even Romeo could be up before the beak for standing under Juliet's window.\" </p> <p>But research has shown that people are reluctant to go to the law for help where stalking is concerned, particularily if they are being harassed by someone they know. And, as Sheridan notes, both the aforementioned concerns about the law have already been borne out in practice, but not thus far in the way Kenny predicted. \"One of the first cases to be brought under the new act failed after a judge ruled that 'it was not a crime to court somebody',\" she says. \"This was despite allegations that the defendant had kept his victim under almost constant surveillance, and had bombarded her with unwanted gifts and letters over a two-year period, forcing her to move to another country. The judge ruled that the defendant's actions were innocuous, as no violent act had been committed.\" </p> <p>The problem here is that one person's justified pursuit of a former lover is another person's unwarranted harassment. Somehow, the law has to decide, among other things, the point at which the former becomes the latter. Additionally, many of the activities associated with stalking are, of themselves, innocuous - sending flowers, for example - but, when repeated daily and combined with a whole range of other seemingly innocuous activities (love letters, hanging around, turning up in the same pub as if by accident) become intrusive and unsettling to the person on the receiving end of the unwanted attention. </p> <p>Matters are complicated further by the fact that most of us, at some time or another - in the white heat of first love, say, or the intensity of adolescent infatuation - have probaly behaved, for a short while at least, just as a stalker might. We may have followed our object of devotion home more than once, or loitered around near their home. Does this irrationality in the face of extreme emotional turmoil - which is only an innately human response, after all - make everyone of us potential stalkers? </p> <p>\"Most people you speak to will eventually admit that they have been through this experience, either as object or as perpetrator,\" says Petch. \"We will all, at one time or another, have displayed certain traits that could be defined as stalking. The thing is, though, that there is a borderline that most of us do not cross. Stalking is about a persistent or repetitive pattern of behaviour that almost always escalates in intensity until it becomes intrusive in a constant and often unrelenting way. It is up to the law to establish when that line is crossed. Judges and the police should have increased training in the uses of the Protection From Harrassment Act. It will be two or three years before we know whether it is working effectively, but, as it stands, many people who should know about it remain relatively ignorant.\" </p> <p>To this end, Detective Inspector Hamish Brown of the Metropolitan Police is compiling a handbook on police procedure relating to stalkers, and at least one lawyer is writing a book on the ramifications of the act. His advice is simple: \"People should contact the police as soon as possible if there is any repetition. It helps immensely if victims keep a log or diary of what has happened to them, but the main thing is that they should come forward and alert the police as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, stalking remains an elusive and complex crime, one that is both relatively easy to commit and relatively difficult to define, never mind prosecute. All of which must make it the most talked-about yet least understood crime of modern times. Here are some of the facts we know about stalking. More than 75% of stalkers are men who stalk women. Stalkers tend to be older than other criminal offenders, and to be loners. They also tend to be more intelligent and more resourceful than the average criminal, and better educated than other groups of offenders with mental disorders. An estimated 22% of stalkings are violent - 2% of all homicides in the US are stalking-related. </p> <p>Professor Paul Mullen, an Australian psychologist, has divided stalkers into five categories: (1) Intimacy Seekers - those who attempt to form a relationship with their object or victim. These are often celebrity stalkers. They can suffer from erotomania or harbour a morbid fascination with their objects. (2) The Rejected - individuals who were once intimate with their victims, usually ex-partners, but often just friends or business associates. Stalking begins at the break-up of the relationship and, often, initial attempts at reconciliation turn into a quest for revenge. A fixation on the failed relationship exacerbates their behaviour and prevents them from forming other meaningful relationships. This is the largest group of stalkers, and the most likely to be violent. (3) The Resentful - the basic motivation is revenge. The intention is to frighten and distress the victim. Often, there is no prior intimate relationship, and professionals (doctors, lawyers, politicians) are the usual targets. These stalkers are often intent on punishing an organisation, so damage to property is common; they are more likely to specialise in frightening encounters than assault. (4) The Predatory - those who stalk prior to a sexual attack. They will derive excitement and sexual pleasure from planning an attack. Often driven by deviant desires and with a history of prior offending. (5) The Incompetent - individuals with a lack of general social confidence and an inability to form intimate, meaningful relationships. To compensate, they form a distant relationship with a love object. The relationship is never consummated, therefore never threatening to them. </p> <p> According to Petch, the most dangerous type of stalker, and the most difficult to treat, is one whose motivation is, or includes, revenge: \"Often, they are individuals who I would class as morbidly querulous. They tend to be argumentative, paranoid and often highly intelligent, with a morbid preoccupation with their own rights and little regard for the feelings or opinions of others. These individuals often have a warped perception of injustice based on fairly neutral events and are out to get revenge. They are definitely the most difficult to treat.\" </p> <p>But has he ever treated a stalker who was simply a stalker - that is, someone who had no underlying psychiatric disorder? \"No. Stalking is a behaviour, not a condition. A very high proportion of stalkers will be mentally ill; maybe 75% will have a psychological abnormality. It's common sense, but it needs to be stated. All psychiatric diagnoses are possible - schizophrenia, mood disorders, morbid infatuation, even substance abuse.\" </p> <p>Fine, but that leaves 25% who, presumably, aren't mentally ill? \"Well, that's where it gets complex, because they may not be mentally ill but they will almost certainly be suffering from a personality disorder of some description, probably a disorder of attachment. Any relationship is an attachment, and if that attachment is somehow abnormal - say, a fairly casual relationship that is invested with great importance - stalking may well follow. Most stalkers will have difficulties with attaching and unattaching themselves [from relationships], difficulties that stem from infancy, and they will have problems with abandonment, rejection, coping with low self esteem - all the things, in fact, that go with the ending of a relationship.\" </p> <p>So, we are back on the shifting, often treacherous undercurrents of human relationships, trying to negotiate that ill-defined hinterland beween love and obsession. The nature of the relationship between stalker and victim is often a key determinant of the type of stalking that occurs: the closer the victim to the perpetrator, the more intense the stalking. Says Petch, \"An ex-husband, say, will be more violent than a casual acquaintance. Usually. That is a broad generalisation. It will not necessarily be true in any individual case.\" </p> <p>\"Usually\", and \"probably\", are words Petch uses a lot because, as he says time and again, \"research is still in its infancy\". To this end, his aim is to set up Britain's first clinic dedicated to treating stalkers. UK research has so far concentrated on collating information about the prevalence of the crime and the effect it has on victims; little or nothing is known about the response of stalkers to treatments that deal with specifically diagnosed underlying conditions such as erotomania. Stalkers, unlike murderers, are not required by law to submit to psychiatric diagnosis. </p> <p>Petch is the first to admit that, if his plans come to fruition, he will be dealing with an almost unknown quantity and that, in other countries, there has not been a great success rate in the treatment and managment of stalkers. \"They tend to reoffend,\" he says wearily, \"and sometimes enforced separation through the courts is the only effective answer. Or enforced incarceration. The easiest way is not to treat them: to send them home or to lock them up. But it's worth trying. What we know for sure is that stalking is on the increase, and that we have to deal with it somehow. It makes perfect sense that we should do it sooner rather than later. We can't simply ignore it and hope it will go away,\" he concludes. \"Just ask any victim - they will tell you that that is not what happens.\" </p> <p>A few days after the police talked the stalker down from Peter's roof, another letter and a bunch of flowers arrive at the house, sent from a local hospital. Peter throws them into the bin. Another note arrives a few days later, then nothing. The last time I talked to him, the stalking seemed to have stopped, as suddenly and inexplicably as it began. \"I hope and pray it's over,\" he says. \"I still look out of the window from time to time - just in case. Ultimately, though, there's no way of knowing if someone is watching you. You have to assume they aren't and get on with your life. It's difficult but, the more I find out about stalking, the more I realise how lucky we are. Most victims are put through hell over and over again. It's relentless and inexplicable, and I can now see how it could affect your life forever. I don't understand it, but I do think these people need help, otherwise they'll just keep doing it. That's something I just don't want to think about right now.\"</p> <p>UPDATE: This article was amended on 22 November 2012 to remove a reference to a named individual.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It begins with the discovery of an unaddressed, unstamped envelope in the morning post at an east London house. The owner, who we shall call Peter, picks it up, thinking it is just more unsolicited junk mail. It reeks of cheap perfume. Inside, is a handwritten letter that begins, \"Dear Ewen...\" It reads like a teenage love letter to a famous person. There is no clue as to the sender's identity, save for an illegible signature. Peter assumes that it has been put through the wrong letterbox; he throws it aside and forgets all about it. A few days later, another hand-delivered letter arrives. Again, it smells heavily of perfume and begins, \"Dear Ewen...\" Intrigued now, Peter compares it to the first letter: same handwriting, same scrawled signature. This time, however, there is a marked difference in the tone, which is more plaintive, forlorn even, the writer pleading for a meeting with her object of desire. Peter studies the signature; he thinks it reads \"Angel\". Over the next few weeks, the letters keep arriving, fitfully at first, then virtually every day. Peter's initial bemusement turns to anger - his wife, Joan, is eight months pregnant, and the last thing they need is some nutter bombarding the house with letters to someone who doesn't even live there. Peter keeps watch at various times, but never catches sight of anyone loitering near the house. Then, one day, a bunch of flowers and another letter are put through the letterbox. A few nights later, Joan is awoken by the sound of a tremulous female voice reciting a poem - or it might be a prayer? - outside. It is 3am. She wakes Peter. As he stumbles to the window, they hear the sound of footsteps scurrying away. Joan is now spooked, and finds it hard to be alone in the house. Peter takes the next day off work and, in the afternoon, sees a young woman hanging around on the corner opposite. He runs down into the street, but she has disappeared. Nothing happens for a few days, but it soon starts up again: irregular letters, flowers, all usually delivered in the dead of night. Once, Peter brings some flowers of his own home to cheer up his wife. He places them in a vase by the window. That night, he finds a note in his hall: \"I saw the sign you left in the window for me. I know you want me.\" Peter says nothing to his wife, but, before going to bed, he snatches up the pile of letters and throws them into the street. It makes him feel better. Until morning, that is, when they are again piled up in the hallway. Furious now, he throws them in the bin. Then he does what he should have done weeks before. He calls the police. \"It sounds stupid,\" Peter says now, \"but, for a long time, I didn't take it seriously. There are a lot of benign nutters on the streets. I guess I thought it would just stop.\" A policeman duly calls and tells them that he'll keep an eye on the house, but that there is not much more that the police can do without hard evidence and Peter, ironically, has destroyed it. A few days later, alone in the house, Joan is woken from an afternoon nap by the cat leaping on to the bed beside her. Instinctively, she reaches out to stroke it. She recoils at once: in its mouth, the cat is carrying a pair of blood-stained knickers wrapped in a pink bow. Joan freaks out and runs out of the house. Distraught, she rings Peter from the high street. She refuses to go home. Peter rings the police again and \"goes ballistic\". It works. \"I don't know if they just didn't believe me before, but as soon as they saw the knickers everything changed. We were interviewed by a very attentive and sympathetic woman PC. By now, though, I was at the end of my tether. I just wanted this deluded woman out of my life.\" For a while, it seems as if his wish had been granted. There are no letters, no flowers. Peter organises a rota of friends to drop by to keep Joan company. Then, one morning, when she is expecting a neighbour to call, she opens the door to a stranger. A young, heavily made-up woman pushes past her into the house, oblivious to Joan's protests. She disappears up the stairs, leaving in her wake a familiar scent. Joan freezes. She can hear the bath being run upstairs and, unbelievably, the stranger singing merrily to herself. Joan grabs her mobile phone and runs into the street, where she rings first the police and then her husband. By the time Peter arrives home, police and paramedics are trying to coax a half-naked young woman down off the roof terrace. Except that she is not a young woman at all, but a young man in drag. He/she is eventually sedated and carried out of Peter's house on a stretcher. It feels like the end of a nightmare. Although the names and location have been changed, this is the record of a recent stalking that lasted about three months. I know all about it not through journalistic investigation but because it happened to friends of mine. At one of the happiest moments of their life - the birth of their first child - their world was thrown out of kilter by a stranger who, without the slightest evidence, had become fixated on the idea that a celebrity lived in their house. It would be absurd - laughable, even - were it not so frightening. \"It's strange,\" Peter tells me when things no longer seem so fraught, so unremitting, \"but she seemed to be stalking the house, rather than us. I suppose she probably never meant us any harm.\" I nod reassuringly, but, deep down, I'm thinking, who knows? Who knows what someone that deluded and that obsessive might be thinking? Or, indeed, might do? When I first heard about Peter's predicament, I thought that, maybe, I could find out. My plan was to hang around near Peter's house until I saw this irrational individual push a letter or flowers through the letterbox, then, in true investigative fashion, I would confront him/her, and demand to know what he/she thought he/she was playing at. That would have been a big mistake. Why? Listen to Lorraine Sheridan, a psychologist at Leicester University, who has been collating statistical data on stalkers' victims: \"Stalkers are often obsessional and deluded,\" she says. \"To think that you can talk to them rationally about what they are doing is also deluded. Simply going up to a stalker in the street and asking them to explain themselves would probably be fruitless and, more to the point, could well be dangerous. First up, you are giving them attention, which, in their eyes, could well be a kind of vindication of their behaviour. Second, the stalking of a particular individual often stops only when the stalker becomes attached to someone else, usually someone who has given them attention.\" Or there's the testimony of Dr Edward Petch, a forensic psychologist who works in the secure unit of Ealing Hospital and who has seen more than his fair share of disturbed individuals. \"I deal with mentally-disordered offenders from the more violent end of the spectrum: murderers, rapists, sometimes multiple killers,\" he says. \"But, in terms of my own safety, it's the stalkers who keep me awake at night. I find myself worrying about what they are capable of, and the degree of their disturbance, trying to establish what it is that is driving them. There is often a separate quality to them, an inability to acknowledge that what they are doing is wrong, or to see the effects it is having on their victims. That is quite chilling.\" In terms of media attention, stalking is the crime of the moment. It is also, despite the recent deluge of cases concerning ordinary individuals, fixed firmly in the public consciousness as a crime against celebrities. Writing in this paper last year, the psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud claimed provocatively that having a stalker was the ultimate fashion accessory. I doubt that Monica Seles (stabbed by G\u00fcnther Parche, who had a long-term obsession with Steffi Graf) or Madonna (stalked for five years by Robert Dewey Hoskins, who threatened to slice her \"from ear to ear\" unless she married him) would agree with him. Sometimes, the media reports have a surreal element: the weatherman, Bill Giles, stalked by his own niece; the actor, Michael J Fox, pestered by a fan who sent him more than 5,000 letters, usually filled with rabbit droppings; Klaus Wagner, who followed Princess Diana to protect her from a \"Satan conspiracy\" supposedly waged against her by the Queen - \"Elizardbeast, we are 666 of you\" read one of his many bizarre placards. More often, however, the stories confirm Petch's conclusion that there is something uniquely chilling about stalkers and their methods: the widow of murdered headmaster, Philip Lawrence, stalked by a stranger wearing a hood; Ulrika Jonsson, bombarded with obscene phone calls and nude photos by Peter Casey, who threw himself under a train after police questioning; Lady Helen Taylor, stalked by Simon Reynolds, who also committed suicide. A few weeks ago, 30-year-old Jeremy Dyer was jailed for two-and-a-half years for stalking TV newsreader, Sarah Lockett - his campaign included bombarding her with 80 obscene letters, two of which alluded to the recent death of another newsreader, Jill Dando: \"I think the whole Jill Dando thing is great. I was hoping a celebrity would be murdered by a stalker, and it makes it even better that she read the news.\" Some experts, Petch among them, even claim that our society inadvertently encourages stalking, whether through the pursuit of the famous by the tabloids and the paparazzi - remember, for instance, the short-lived debate about whether Princess Diana was stalked to death? - or in the more collusive intrusions in magazines such as Hello! and OK!. Here, a carefully staged intimacy is sold to the highest bidder, often by those same stars who bemoan media incursions into their privacy. \"Those magazines peddle a kind of titillation,\" says Petch. \"If you see a star stretched out on her bed in her house, you can fantasise that you know her intimately because you know what her bedroom looks like. Those kind of images foster a false sense of intimacy and even identification. The fan-celebrity relationship is a very confused one in our society because we are encouraged to think that we know so much about the famous when, in effect, we know very little.\" So, on one quite complex level, a celebrity, as defined in the pages of Hello!, say, is a stranger whom we think we know; a stranger, what's more, who encourages our gaze, whose very being is tied up with our fascination with them. Is it any wonder, then, that celebrities often attract strangers who are convinced that, should the object of their devotion simply meet them, a bond will immediately be formed, a special intimacy born? When this turns out not to be the case, fan worship often mutates into a different, darker kind of obsession. Steven Spielberg is only one of many celebrities who have had to seek court restriction orders to deal with obsessive fans whose fascination seems somehow linked to fantasies of revenge and punishment. Spielberg's stalker, who on one occasion tried to ram the security gates of the director's Malibu home, was recently apprehended lurking near the house. In his car boot, the police found handcuffs, industrial adhesive tape, a knife and a collection of syringes. Stalking might appear to be a quintessentially contemporary crime, a phenomenon linked to our culture's collective and seemingly insatiable obsession with the minutiae of the celebrity lifestyle. In fact, the activity is neither new, nor is it a crime more likely to happen to the famous than to those engaged in more \"ordinary\" careers - though some evidence suggests that certain professions attract an above-average degree of stalkers, including, perhaps predictably, actors and politicians and, perhaps surprisingly, doctors. \"Stalking has probably been going on for hundreds of years,\" says Petch. \"It seems like a recent phenomenon probably because our ability to detect it has improved of late. That said, most cases involving ordinary people don't come to the attention of the courts at all, either because the stalkers haven't broken any laws - standing on a corner or sending flowers is not breaking the law, necessarily - or the stalker is convicted for some single thing that they have done in the course of their stalking, maybe breaking-and-entering or making an obscene phone call, and it's not recorded as a crime of stalking. I'd say it is probably a lot more prevalent than we think.\" Petch's overview is borne out by the increasing number of cases that are reported in the press concerning ordinary people who, without recourse to the kind of security and protection that celebrities can afford, often undergo prolonged ordeals of the most nightmarish kind. My friends' experience, though intrusive and frightening, was a relatively low-level persecution compared with some recently reported incidences: the dental nurse, Perry Southall, who was stalked by Clarence Morris, a convicted rapist, for eight months and endured 200 incidents of harassment; 13-year-old Maria Cross, who was followed relentlessly by unemployed loner Stephen Gomes; David Greenhaulgh, who was obsessively pursued by Anita Hall (when she was prevented from entering his workplace, she poured petrol over two receptionists and tried to set them alight). A 1977 survey carried out by NOP Solutions found that 19% of women and 8% of men in the UK had experienced threatening behaviour of the kind associated with stalking; that 25% of all respondents said that they knew someone who had been a victim of stalking, either face to face or through persistent phone calls. In the US, meanwhile, an estimated 8% of women have been stalked at some time, more than 1 million women are stalked annually, and an estimated one in six of women murdered each year have first been stalked. Stalking is a crime that, as Peter and Joan found out, often begins without motive, escalates in occurrence and in intensity, and, in many cases, continues for years rather than months. Many of the recorded stalkings in the UK have lasted between five and seven years, though Lorraine Sheridan at Leicester University told me of one woman she had uncovered in her research who had been stalked for 40 years. \"Research about stalking is still in its infancy,\" says Petch, \"so there is not a lot we can say with absolute certainty about the activity. Except this: stalking persists.\" In the shorter Oxford English Dictionary, stalking is defined simply as \"walking cautiously or stealthily. Pursuing a quarry or game by stealthy approach, especially undercover.\" The stalking of human quarry, however, is an activity that resists such easy definition. Australian psychologists, Michele Pathe and Paul Mullan, who have studied the subject, write: \"Stalking describes a constellation of behaviours in which one individual inflicts on another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications. The intrusions can involve following, loitering nearby, maintaining surveillance and making approaches. The communication can be through letters, the telephone, electronic mail, graffiti, or notes attached, for example, to the victim's car... Specific or implied threats to the safety of the objects of these attentions may be made, and physical and sexual assaults may also occur. Third parties, including friends and relatives of the victim, may also attract threats and violence from the stalker.\" Finding a workable legal definition has proved more difficult. In the US, it was the burgeoning threat to celebrities from stalkers that brought about Section 646, Part 9, of the Californian Penal Code, which defines a stalker as \"any person who wilfully, maliciously and repeatedly follows and harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety\". To date, 29 states have implemented stalking laws, and Los Angeles - where else? - has set up a Police Threat Management Unit specifically to deal with the crime. The US definition has proved problematic not least because it requires proof of intent and, thus, puts the onus on the victim. Ironically, many stalkers have no intention of harming their object or, indeed, any understanding of the harm they are causing. (One of the most common delusions that prompts stalking is erotomania, which, put simply, is the false belief that someone else loves you, when there is no evidence to support that belief. Erotomaniacs make up about 10% of all stalkers and, as Petch points out, \"their misguided belief in the certainty of their cause is a classic illustration of the folly of including the notion of intent in the law\".) The case that changed the law in the UK concerned Tracey Morgan, who was stalked by Anthony Burstow, a casual acquaintance, for seven years. Burstow was someone whose sole intention was to cause severe distress. \"I wanted to muck around with her head,\" he told the police. \"That's what this is all about.\" His sustained campaign of terror included threatening phone calls and letters, veiled death threats, constant surveillance of her house, pouring oil on her car, covering her lawn with condoms, sending her sanitary towels in the post and breaking into her home to plant listening devices in the bedroom. When the police arrested him, they found a vast collection of medical paraphernalia in his house, including syringes, needles, a blood-transfusion kit and details of his future plans, which included sending her spiders and snails through the post. In a recent television documentary, I'll Be Watching You, Morgan summed up the mental and physical cost of this harassment thus: \"In a cruel and arbitrary way, I was isolated and rendered unable to function properly. I was simply destroyed by someone who was fixated on me, and left bewildered, frightened and without any real protection.\" The ordeal cost Morgan her health, her house (she moved cities three times) and her marriage, but, in the end, through sheer force of will, she triumphed by going public and illustrating the huge gap in the law that allowed all this to happen. In 1996, Burstow was the first person ever to be charged with Grevious Mental Harm. He was found guilty and jailed for five years. Still, his persecution of Morgan continued: from his cell, he sent her an elaborate crossword puzzle wherein each clue referred to private, often intimate, information about her family; and later, while still in prison, he was arrested for soliciting to murder after guards found out that he had approached fellow criminals offering them \u00a33,500 to kill Tracey's husband-to-be. The year after Burstow's conviction, the government controversially pushed through the Protection From Harassment Act, a carefully-worded, wide-ranging piece of legislation that, though created to deal with the problem of stalking, studiously avoided using the term at all, so complex were the problems of definition. Sheridan, in her research paper, Stalking: Perceptions And Prevalence, points out that, even though the law was passed, \"a legal definition of stalking was never provided, and no accepted definition of stalking currently exists\". The two main concerns about the act's enforceability are that it does not clarify what, exactly, constitutes the criminal act of stalking, and that it does not distinguish between the dangerous stalker and what one expert calls \"the misguided fool wallowing in the anguish of betrayal\". Surprisingly, much of the press reaction to the act concentrated on the possible effect it might have on what one writer called \"persistent suitors\", rather than on the protection of the victim. Mary Kenny, for instance, writing in the Express, claimed that, \"Women are being turned into powerless, infantile victims encouraged to cry, 'Ma, he's making eyes at me!' and run for the protection of the State to deal with every vexatious private encounter... Even Romeo could be up before the beak for standing under Juliet's window.\" But research has shown that people are reluctant to go to the law for help where stalking is concerned, particularily if they are being harassed by someone they know. And, as Sheridan notes, both the aforementioned concerns about the law have already been borne out in practice, but not thus far in the way Kenny predicted. \"One of the first cases to be brought under the new act failed after a judge ruled that 'it was not a crime to court somebody',\" she says. \"This was despite allegations that the defendant had kept his victim under almost constant surveillance, and had bombarded her with unwanted gifts and letters over a two-year period, forcing her to move to another country. The judge ruled that the defendant's actions were innocuous, as no violent act had been committed.\" The problem here is that one person's justified pursuit of a former lover is another person's unwarranted harassment. Somehow, the law has to decide, among other things, the point at which the former becomes the latter. Additionally, many of the activities associated with stalking are, of themselves, innocuous - sending flowers, for example - but, when repeated daily and combined with a whole range of other seemingly innocuous activities (love letters, hanging around, turning up in the same pub as if by accident) become intrusive and unsettling to the person on the receiving end of the unwanted attention. Matters are complicated further by the fact that most of us, at some time or another - in the white heat of first love, say, or the intensity of adolescent infatuation - have probaly behaved, for a short while at least, just as a stalker might. We may have followed our object of devotion home more than once, or loitered around near their home. Does this irrationality in the face of extreme emotional turmoil - which is only an innately human response, after all - make everyone of us potential stalkers? \"Most people you speak to will eventually admit that they have been through this experience, either as object or as perpetrator,\" says Petch. \"We will all, at one time or another, have displayed certain traits that could be defined as stalking. The thing is, though, that there is a borderline that most of us do not cross. Stalking is about a persistent or repetitive pattern of behaviour that almost always escalates in intensity until it becomes intrusive in a constant and often unrelenting way. It is up to the law to establish when that line is crossed. Judges and the police should have increased training in the uses of the Protection From Harrassment Act. It will be two or three years before we know whether it is working effectively, but, as it stands, many people who should know about it remain relatively ignorant.\" To this end, Detective Inspector Hamish Brown of the Metropolitan Police is compiling a handbook on police procedure relating to stalkers, and at least one lawyer is writing a book on the ramifications of the act. His advice is simple: \"People should contact the police as soon as possible if there is any repetition. It helps immensely if victims keep a log or diary of what has happened to them, but the main thing is that they should come forward and alert the police as soon as possible.\" Nonetheless, stalking remains an elusive and complex crime, one that is both relatively easy to commit and relatively difficult to define, never mind prosecute. All of which must make it the most talked-about yet least understood crime of modern times. Here are some of the facts we know about stalking. More than 75% of stalkers are men who stalk women. Stalkers tend to be older than other criminal offenders, and to be loners. They also tend to be more intelligent and more resourceful than the average criminal, and better educated than other groups of offenders with mental disorders. An estimated 22% of stalkings are violent - 2% of all homicides in the US are stalking-related. Professor Paul Mullen, an Australian psychologist, has divided stalkers into five categories: (1) Intimacy Seekers - those who attempt to form a relationship with their object or victim. These are often celebrity stalkers. They can suffer from erotomania or harbour a morbid fascination with their objects. (2) The Rejected - individuals who were once intimate with their victims, usually ex-partners, but often just friends or business associates. Stalking begins at the break-up of the relationship and, often, initial attempts at reconciliation turn into a quest for revenge. A fixation on the failed relationship exacerbates their behaviour and prevents them from forming other meaningful relationships. This is the largest group of stalkers, and the most likely to be violent. (3) The Resentful - the basic motivation is revenge. The intention is to frighten and distress the victim. Often, there is no prior intimate relationship, and professionals (doctors, lawyers, politicians) are the usual targets. These stalkers are often intent on punishing an organisation, so damage to property is common; they are more likely to specialise in frightening encounters than assault. (4) The Predatory - those who stalk prior to a sexual attack. They will derive excitement and sexual pleasure from planning an attack. Often driven by deviant desires and with a history of prior offending. (5) The Incompetent - individuals with a lack of general social confidence and an inability to form intimate, meaningful relationships. To compensate, they form a distant relationship with a love object. The relationship is never consummated, therefore never threatening to them. According to Petch, the most dangerous type of stalker, and the most difficult to treat, is one whose motivation is, or includes, revenge: \"Often, they are individuals who I would class as morbidly querulous. They tend to be argumentative, paranoid and often highly intelligent, with a morbid preoccupation with their own rights and little regard for the feelings or opinions of others. These individuals often have a warped perception of injustice based on fairly neutral events and are out to get revenge. They are definitely the most difficult to treat.\" But has he ever treated a stalker who was simply a stalker - that is, someone who had no underlying psychiatric disorder? \"No. Stalking is a behaviour, not a condition. A very high proportion of stalkers will be mentally ill; maybe 75% will have a psychological abnormality. It's common sense, but it needs to be stated. All psychiatric diagnoses are possible - schizophrenia, mood disorders, morbid infatuation, even substance abuse.\" Fine, but that leaves 25% who, presumably, aren't mentally ill? \"Well, that's where it gets complex, because they may not be mentally ill but they will almost certainly be suffering from a personality disorder of some description, probably a disorder of attachment. Any relationship is an attachment, and if that attachment is somehow abnormal - say, a fairly casual relationship that is invested with great importance - stalking may well follow. Most stalkers will have difficulties with attaching and unattaching themselves [from relationships], difficulties that stem from infancy, and they will have problems with abandonment, rejection, coping with low self esteem - all the things, in fact, that go with the ending of a relationship.\" So, we are back on the shifting, often treacherous undercurrents of human relationships, trying to negotiate that ill-defined hinterland beween love and obsession. The nature of the relationship between stalker and victim is often a key determinant of the type of stalking that occurs: the closer the victim to the perpetrator, the more intense the stalking. Says Petch, \"An ex-husband, say, will be more violent than a casual acquaintance. Usually. That is a broad generalisation. It will not necessarily be true in any individual case.\" \"Usually\", and \"probably\", are words Petch uses a lot because, as he says time and again, \"research is still in its infancy\". To this end, his aim is to set up Britain's first clinic dedicated to treating stalkers. UK research has so far concentrated on collating information about the prevalence of the crime and the effect it has on victims; little or nothing is known about the response of stalkers to treatments that deal with specifically diagnosed underlying conditions such as erotomania. Stalkers, unlike murderers, are not required by law to submit to psychiatric diagnosis. Petch is the first to admit that, if his plans come to fruition, he will be dealing with an almost unknown quantity and that, in other countries, there has not been a great success rate in the treatment and managment of stalkers. \"They tend to reoffend,\" he says wearily, \"and sometimes enforced separation through the courts is the only effective answer. Or enforced incarceration. The easiest way is not to treat them: to send them home or to lock them up. But it's worth trying. What we know for sure is that stalking is on the increase, and that we have to deal with it somehow. It makes perfect sense that we should do it sooner rather than later. We can't simply ignore it and hope it will go away,\" he concludes. \"Just ask any victim - they will tell you that that is not what happens.\" A few days after the police talked the stalker down from Peter's roof, another letter and a bunch of flowers arrive at the house, sent from a local hospital. Peter throws them into the bin. Another note arrives a few days later, then nothing. The last time I talked to him, the stalking seemed to have stopped, as suddenly and inexplicably as it began. \"I hope and pray it's over,\" he says. \"I still look out of the window from time to time - just in case. Ultimately, though, there's no way of knowing if someone is watching you. You have to assume they aren't and get on with your life. It's difficult but, the more I find out about stalking, the more I realise how lucky we are. Most victims are put through hell over and over again. It's relentless and inexplicable, and I can now see how it could affect your life forever. I don't understand it, but I do think these people need help, otherwise they'll just keep doing it. That's something I just don't want to think about right now.\" UPDATE: This article was amended on 22 November 2012 to remove a reference to a named individual.",

Their disadvantage lies in control of the cooking temperature. The boiling points of food oils are much too high for cooking food.

Is there a blue haze above it? </p> <p>These, and other indicators, can give an approximate idea of temperature, but the best way to know how hot the oil is is to use a kitchen thermometer. Don't rely on the degree of smokiness of the oil; use a thermometer, and experience the thrill of control in the kitchen (a temperature of around 175C is perfect for most deep-frying, say). Your own experience will let you make personal modifications to suit your own taste. </p> <p>Just remember that the temperature should be a little lower for larger pieces of food, so that the centre has time to reach the correct cooking temperature before the outside becomes overcooked. Remember, too, that if you double the thickness of the cooking food, it will take around four times as long for the centre to reach the optimum cooking temperature. </p> <p>All of these comments apply to deep-frying. Shallow frying, is a completely different kettle of fish, metaphorically speaking - here, a thin layer of oil is used to conduct heat directly from the hot metal surface of a cooking vessel to the food. The oil also serves the purpose of stopping the food from sticking to the cooking vessel. In stir-frying, meanwhile, this protective layer of oil can drain from between the food and the pan surface if the pan is left standing - that's why you move the food around, so that the protective layer is continually renewed. </p> <p>It is also a good idea to set aside a little of the used oil after you fry, be it deep or shallow. Then, next time you want to fry something, add some of the saved oil to the fresh oil. The reason? Heating breaks down vegetable oils and animal fats to produce monoglycerides, which are natural compounds that can coat the metal surface and prevent sticking. The pure, unused oils are triglycerides, and do not contain these useful monoglycerides. </p> <p>Teflon-coated vessels get around many of these problems, but even then a thin layer of oil helps to distribute the heat more uniformly. Don't you just love being in control? </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Vegetable Tempura </strong><br> 18 French beans<br> 1 red pepper, seeded<br> 12-18 button mushrooms<br> 12 spring onions<br> 3 small courgettes<br> 1 small aubergine<br> For the batter<br> 300ml ice-cold water<br> 1 large free-range egg <br> 300ml by volume plain flour, sifted<br> For the dipping sauce<br> 1 sachet dashi powder<br> 200ml hot water (carnivores can use chicken stock)<br> 1 tsp caster sugar<br> 2 tbsp soy sauce<br> 4 tbsp sake<br> </p> <p>First, make the dipping sauce: dissolve the dashi (get it from Asian supermarkets) in the water, and add the sugar, soy sauce and sake. Divide the sauce between four bowls. Next, prepare the vegetables (the ones listed are merely a guideline; feel free to choose your own). Top and tail the beans. Cut the pepper into strips. Remove the caps from the mushrooms. Trim the spring onions, and cut in half lengthways. Slice the aubergine into very thin lengths. Slice the courgettes. </p> <p>Have to hand a large dish lined with kitchen towel. Heat a deep-fat fryer filled with clean frying oil to 190C. While the oil is heating, make the batter. Mix the egg with the water, then sift in the flour and stir. The batter is ready when it is lumpy with still-discernible traces of flour in it. Toss the vegetables in flour, dust off the excess, dip in the flour again and drop into the batter. Fry for two minutes, turning once. Drain on the kitchen towel. Cook in small batches, and continue thus until all are done. Serve immediately. </p> <p><strong> A squid salad</strong><br> Equally delicious warm or cold. <br> 1.35kg squid, cleaned <br> 2 red peppers <br> 2 red chillies <br> 35g pinenuts <br> 35g raisins <br> 25g capers <br> 2 tbsp red-wine vinegar <br> 6 tbsp top-quality olive oil <br> 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, picked <br> Sea salt and black pepper <br> </p> <p>Grill the peppers until their skin is blistered all over, place in a bowl and cover. Roast the pinenuts until golden. Split the chillies, remove their seeds, then cut into fine dice. Peel and deseed the peppers, retaining the liquid that has formed at the bottom of the bowl, cut into small dice, and put into a large bowl along with the raisins, pinenuts, capers, chillies, vinegar and oil. Mix well. </p> <p>If the squid tubes are intact, cut them into thin rings. If not, flatten and score the flesh, and cut into 2cm squares. Heat a frying pan over a high flame. Place the prepared squid in a bowl and dress with olive oil, salt and pepper. Drop a handful of squid into the pan, leave it for a minute, then toss for 30 seconds longer. Tip into the bowl with the salad, and repeat the cooking until all the squid is done. </p> <p>Mix the salad, then cover and leave for an hour. Add the parsley and serve, adjusting the seasoning as necessary. </p> <p><strong> Fegato alla veneziana </strong><br> 1.1kg calf's liver, in slices about 6mm thick <br> 100g unsalted butter <br> 8 medium onions, very thinly sliced <br> 1 bayleaf <br> 1 pinch sugar <br> Sea salt and black pepper <br> 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar <br> </p> <p>Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot, drop in the onions, and fry until soft and beginning to take on some colour. Turn up the heat, stir, and let the onions darken a little. Add the sugar, vinegar, bayleaf and seasoning, then cover and cook at a low heat for half an hour. Set the pot to one side. </p> <p>Heat a large frying pan and pour in a little olive oil. Lay in some of the liver - do not let it overlap - and fry for 50 seconds or so. Season, then turn over and fry for 30 seconds longer. Remove and keep warm, then repeat until all of the liver is cooked. </p> <p>Tip the cooked onions into the liver pan, mix in the liver, and serve.

Fill a large pan with lightly salted water, add the potatoes, and bring to the boil. Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them, lay them out on a tray and put in a warm oven for five minutes - this will help dry them out. Pass the potato through a mouli or fine sieve, beat in the butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg, cover and set aside until ready to use. </p> <p>Now make the pastry. Put the butter and water in a pan, and bring to the boil. Beat in the flour, remove from the heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Combine the pastry and potato mixtures, then, with lightly floured hands, form it into sausage shapes. Lay these on a floured tray and put in the fridge. Do not make them too large as they will not cook properly inside. </p> <p>Dip the chilled potato shapes into first flour, then eggwash, then breadcrumbs. Heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C, drop in the 'sausages' a layer at a time and fry until golden brown, about five minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve at once. </p> <p><strong>Crepes suzettes</strong><br> Aurum has a style that is rather lacking in more famous orange liqueurs. <br> For the orange butter<br> 250g butter<br> 2 oranges<br> 40g caster sugar<br> 100ml orange juice<br> 4 tbsp Aurum (or other orange liqueur)<br> For the crepe batter<br> 130ml milk<br> 130ml water<br> 3 egg yolks<br> 25g caster sugar<br> 3 dssp Aurum (or other orange liqueur)<br> 130g plain flour<br> 60g melted butter<br> </p> <p>First, make the orange butter. Cut the butter into cubes and put it in a bowl to soften. Finely grate the zest from the oranges, taking care not to scrape off any pith.

      "body": "<p>New Britain is, strictly speaking, an island in the South Pacific. It lies to the north-east of New Guinea, and is the largest island of the Bismarck archipelago. It's a mountainous place with several active volcanoes. The capital is Rabaul and the population, at the last count, 312,995. New Britain is also, of course, the nickname, often tagged with a telling \"plc\", many have given to Great Britain in New Labour's hands. </p> <p>The Blair government has been at pains in its first 1,000 days to modernise this societyless land of individuals and families (a vision of Mrs Thatcher), of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer and invincible green suburbs (John Major), of broad sunlit uplands (Churchill), of fair play (common consent), class distinction (only the truth even though we are all supposed to be middle-class now) and privatised trains (the worst part); not forgetting multiculturalism, accessibility and focus groups. </p> <p>A number of commentators noted that in a speech he gave recently, the prime minister used the word \"new\" no fewer than 38 times. If he had a personal mantra, it might easily be \"new good, old bad\". And it's not hard to imagine flocks of Westminster lobby fodder chanting \"new good, old ba-aa-ad\" like so many sheep. In fighting what he likes to call the \"forces of conservatism\" as if he were Luke Skywalker battling with Darth Vader, Tony Blair, imagines himself to be on some sort of crusade, part-political, part-evangelical that will lead a commercially-driven Britain towards the New Jerusalem. A new covenant will be struck between government and citizens. We will all be stakeholders in this dynamic, corporate, trains-run-on-time (except, understandably, in times of leaf falls and the wrong sort of snow) New Britain plc. </p> <p>And yet, \"new\" has never been inherently better than \"old\" or \"current\", even though the idea of newness suggests a world somehow shinier and cleaner than the one we know: a new three-piece suite for your home, a new formula washing powder, a New Deal for the depressed US economy of the 30s, a new pair of shoes. It is no coincidence that the word has been bandied about by evangelists and fundamentalists since the Reformation at least. And in both war and peace. Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, on whose uniforms the scary armour of Darth Vader might well have been based, was the military instrument by which the old order might be defeated and even destroyed. </p> <p>The New Model Army was as much a political as military force, its muskets the smoking symbols of a New Britain, mid-17th century style. The new order lasted just a few years. In the same century, New Amsterdam (New York from 1664 when captured by the British from the Dutch) must have promised a better world than the tired old Europe protestant settlers had left 40 years before. The New World itself, which surely contained, or so Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century believed, El Dorado - the legendary city of gold - implied something a little closer to the New Jerusalem than the tired civilisations of the Old World. </p> <p>\"O brave new world,/That has such people in't\", says Miranda in Shakespeare's The Tempest. She's just met new people outside her prescribed world on Prospero's magic island for the first time; they happen to be the unpreposessing Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio; \"O my America, my new found land,/My kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned\", just 15 years earlier John Donne wrote punningly, of his new love in his exquisite poem \"To his mistress going to bed\". </p> <p>New lovers, aren't they the best? Free of \"baggage\" as it's fashionable to say (ie of having lived a life, an old life, and thus irredeemable and best replaced by the new as if they were a car, a clutch, a set of shock absorbers). \"New fares\"announced on London Underground posters are surely better than a price increase; the word \"new\" is there to take something of the bitterness from the long-suffering commuter's pill. </p> <p>And so it goes on. Only last week I was shown a packet of ready-made dhal from Tesco Metro. \"New!\" squealed the packet, and yet Indians have been preparing lentils this way for many thousands of years; GM foods aside, as recommended by the New Labour government, there is nothing really new in the world's larder. </p> <p>We do not think much of this new food. New Man would certainly have been suspicious of it. Remember him, that soft-bearded 80s wimp who liked dungarees and Kicker shoes and who would have adored to have breast-fed his babies in public if only he could have? Twit or not, New Man, as the words imply, was meant to be somehow better than Old Man, who drove Jags and drank whisky while pacing hospital corridors when the wife was in labour, and had about as much idea of how to change a nappy as how to identify the G-spot. What spot? G-spot; the sort of thing girls with nothing better to do wrote about in magazines with names like \"New Woman\". </p> <p>In the same humour, the New Left, 60s student radicals who were meant to read Marcuse, smoke dope, refuse Cape apples and be in touch with their feelings, were presumably superior to the Old Left (pipe-smoking, teetotal types who had supported Stalin in their salad days). New wave music of the late 70s was surely better than the old pomp rock of the early 70s. In the world of chic Parisian fashion, surely the \"Nouvelle vague\" had been a cut above \"la vieille vague\"? </p> <p>By the same token,\"New Journalism\", ushered in by Tom Wolfe and gang with its literary pretensions must have been a point-size up on the Old Journalism (whatever that was, although it conjures images of Evelyn Waugh's William Boot sending inept telegraphese messages via cleft-sticks from some improbable war-zone to Fleet Street)? And who remembers having to study the \"New Maths\" at school? This was new, therefore better than the old maths (trig, geom, alg etc) even though it made about as much sense to most 11-year-old schoolchildren as a reading of A Critique of Pure Reason in demotic Greek, loosely translated, would to a gnu. </p> <p>And here the idea of newness begins to crack and strain at its neoprene seams. If the new maths was seemingly designed to make schoolchildren suffer, the \"news\" broadcast on television and radio is far more often sad than happy whilst there are few advocates of New Towns this side of Peter Hall, author of Cities in Civilisation. As for the New Millennium Experience Company (a gloriously Germanic mouthful), the less said the better, yet the old museums with their pre-human dinosaur bones and ancient mummies are widely considered to be greatly more interesting and entertaining than the new Dome, a fabulously costly celebration of the new corporate sponsorship. </p> <p>The idea of newness in religious, political and social thinking, far from being inevitably good and leading to the best possible of all worlds, is often fraught with danger. At best it's a conceit, an emotion, an advertising slogan whether used by the makers of \"New Square Deal Surf\" or neophiliac politicians. The sad truth is that in our quest for new beginnings, we have destroyed as much as we have created. Think of Pol Pot with his absurd, vicious Year Zero. What was the point of destroying an old civilisation? Because the Cambodian warlord could. As Mao could in the Peoples' Republic of China. A \"permanent revolution\" would keep society ever-red and ever new. Millions had to suffer to disprove an ill-made political point. </p> <p>New covenants, new deals, newness in all things is no guarantee of better things to come. What became of the animals of Manor Farm when Napoleon, not forgetting his spin-doctor Squealer, ousted Farmer Brown? Were they better off than before? Of course not, said Orwell. Are we in Britain any happier today for being told what to do and what to say by what has been increasingly perceived as a bullying bunch of messianic and self-important control freaks obsessed with new technology like so many schoolboys sitting alone in their bedrooms downloading weird games? </p> <p>Blair opposes the new with what he calls \"the forces of conservatism\", both left and right and with a large and small \"c\". William Hague and his party, well and fine, but conservatives in general? What on earth does he mean? To conserve is hardly a bad thing whether home-made jam, an ancient yew tree, an age-old right-of-way, a country house, a species of endangered animal or much loved customs and follies. And better than conserving is connecting old and new, the poetry and prose of our lives. </p> <p>In his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Burke compared the state to a tree that whilst it needed pruning to keep its branches healthy, the act of cutting it down or uprooting it could only destroy civil society. In his radical Vers une Architecture (1923), and despite its bombastic revolutionary language, Le Corbusier demonstrated how the new aesthetic of the motor-car, ocean-liner and aircraft could be translated into architecture without losing its connection to the age-old proportional systems that had given us the Parthenon in classical times, Notre-Dame in Gothic. Yet, when the book was translated into English by Frederick Etchells (1927), it was given the title Towards a New Architecture, which was was a different point and not the one the great Swiss architect was making. </p> <p>Bach created radical music in the 17th century, yet it was rooted in the classical elements of mathematics and architecture. Of course, the Goldberg Variations or the St John Passion would have sounded odd at first if these pieces could have been played to ancient Greek audiences, yet they might well have decoded the structural relationship between their architecture and Bach's scores soon enough. Bach's music, in other words, was rooted deep down in a very old world indeed. As was, of course, the music of Stravinsky and the art of Picasso in the 20th century. </p> <p>Visitors to the Museo Picasso in Barcelona are nearly always taken aback by the strength and conviction of this restless artist's student drawings, things of voluptuous classical splendour. Equally, Picasso was deeply influenced by the old arts of black Africa which he encountered with Braque at the great Paris exhibition of 1900. What all these artists had in common was their ability to connect with the sensual world in all its glory - old, new, exotic, close-to-home - and to reconfigure it through the clarifying or distorting lenses of their mind's eyes to push and even shock us into looking or listening to the world in fresh ways. They were never new in the Blairite sense of the word. </p> <p>Oh, but \"new\" suggests vigour, youth, freshness and vitality. And it sells, washing powder, sex and politics. And, if you don't like this obsession, you can always clear off for an old way of life in the old New Britain, that island where, one imagines, time stands pretty still, somewhere in the Bismarck archipelago to the north-east of New Guinea.</p>",

The idea of newness in religious, political and social thinking, far from being inevitably good and leading to the best possible of all worlds, is often fraught with danger. At best it's a conceit, an emotion, an advertising slogan whether used by the makers of \"New Square Deal Surf\" or neophiliac politicians. The sad truth is that in our quest for new beginnings, we have destroyed as much as we have created. Think of Pol Pot with his absurd, vicious Year Zero. What was the point of destroying an old civilisation? Because the Cambodian warlord could. As Mao could in the Peoples' Republic of China. A \"permanent revolution\" would keep society ever-red and ever new. Millions had to suffer to disprove an ill-made political point. New covenants, new deals, newness in all things is no guarantee of better things to come. What became of the animals of Manor Farm when Napoleon, not forgetting his spin-doctor Squealer, ousted Farmer Brown? Were they better off than before? Of course not, said Orwell. Are we in Britain any happier today for being told what to do and what to say by what has been increasingly perceived as a bullying bunch of messianic and self-important control freaks obsessed with new technology like so many schoolboys sitting alone in their bedrooms downloading weird games? Blair opposes the new with what he calls \"the forces of conservatism\", both left and right and with a large and small \"c\". William Hague and his party, well and fine, but conservatives in general? What on earth does he mean? To conserve is hardly a bad thing whether home-made jam, an ancient yew tree, an age-old right-of-way, a country house, a species of endangered animal or much loved customs and follies. And better than conserving is connecting old and new, the poetry and prose of our lives. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Burke compared the state to a tree that whilst it needed pruning to keep its branches healthy, the act of cutting it down or uprooting it could only destroy civil society. In his radical Vers une Architecture (1923), and despite its bombastic revolutionary language, Le Corbusier demonstrated how the new aesthetic of the motor-car, ocean-liner and aircraft could be translated into architecture without losing its connection to the age-old proportional systems that had given us the Parthenon in classical times, Notre-Dame in Gothic. Yet, when the book was translated into English by Frederick Etchells (1927), it was given the title Towards a New Architecture, which was was a different point and not the one the great Swiss architect was making. Bach created radical music in the 17th century, yet it was rooted in the classical elements of mathematics and architecture. Of course, the Goldberg Variations or the St John Passion would have sounded odd at first if these pieces could have been played to ancient Greek audiences, yet they might well have decoded the structural relationship between their architecture and Bach's scores soon enough. Bach's music, in other words, was rooted deep down in a very old world indeed. As was, of course, the music of Stravinsky and the art of Picasso in the 20th century. Visitors to the Museo Picasso in Barcelona are nearly always taken aback by the strength and conviction of this restless artist's student drawings, things of voluptuous classical splendour. Equally, Picasso was deeply influenced by the old arts of black Africa which he encountered with Braque at the great Paris exhibition of 1900. What all these artists had in common was their ability to connect with the sensual world in all its glory - old, new, exotic, close-to-home - and to reconfigure it through the clarifying or distorting lenses of their mind's eyes to push and even shock us into looking or listening to the world in fresh ways. They were never new in the Blairite sense of the word. Oh, but \"new\" suggests vigour, youth, freshness and vitality. And it sells, washing powder, sex and politics. And, if you don't like this obsession, you can always clear off for an old way of life in the old New Britain, that island where, one imagines, time stands pretty still, somewhere in the Bismarck archipelago to the north-east of New Guinea.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Dear Alan,</strong><br> Do suits make for a better workplace? The Arthur Andersen company, which this week dropped the requirement to wear suits from its dress code, seems not to think so. I disagree: you might not be surprised to hear this, coming from a tailor, but I think most people feel the same. The effort we take in our own personal appearance and style of dress is, rightly or wrongly, always used by others as an initial indication of our character. Not very PC, I know, but a fact that has always been true and, I suspect, always will be. </p> <p>In a business environment, first impressions are paramount. I'm not arguing for the introduction of office uniforms - the colour and style of a beautiful suit should, clearly, be as individual as the wearer - but a professional appearance nevertheless speaks volumes about the attitude of an individual and the individual's company. And where do we stop? In 20 years, will office workers claim that there's no need to cut their hair for six months, or shower only once a week, because it doesn't affect their work? </p> <p>Like it or not, most people instinctively want to enjoy the confidence and sense of wellbeing that a quality suit can offer, to a far greater degree than the most fashionable designer jeans and trainers. <br> Yours, Tom Mahon, <br> Tailor, Steed Bespoke Tailors </p> <p><strong> Dear Tom,</strong><br> Chill, baby. Try and catch Arthur Andersen's new drift. This \"first impressions are paramount\" thing, it's true. But the company is saying \"look, guys, we're not starchy, we're not stiff - we're in the idea business here. We're creative people. We can be buttoned-down without being double-cuffed.\" </p> <p>They're just catching a ride on New Britain's new informal approach to business. Take a look at today's high-rollers in commerce: Branson is in jumpers; Evans is in baseball caps; Lynne Franks and Anita Roddick are in kaftans, for Christ's sake! These free-wheeling tycoons know that cut-away collars and twin-sets constrict the flow of blood to their brain. If someone wears a suit in my workplace, it's because they're off to a bereavement party or they've been busted - or worse. And it's not just us - it's a lot of our clients too. They wear slacks, they wear fashion tops and they're saying: \"We're not Ms Brown and Mr Jenkins - we're Lisa and Dave. You can hang with us.\" </p> <p>But I agree with you on personal hygiene. I mean, what if Arthur Andersen's employees actually did stop showering? I don't know about you, but I find the idea of meeting any kind of management consultant an alarming prospect, let alone a stinky one. <br> Increase the peace, <br> Al Young, <br> Creative director, <br> St Luke's advertising agency </p> <p><strong> Dear Al,</strong><br> \"Chill, baby\"; \"new drift\"_ Help! The admen are coming! Branson and Evans as fine examples of the new trend? Well, I suppose so, if you consider delayed trains and ginger hair to be cool. I don't doubt the professional abilities of the high-rollers you mention, but aren't they just the ones at the tip of the business iceberg? We all know that changes in our working environment are leading to a diminishing amount of personal contact, which can, unfortunately, fool us into thinking that, since everything can be done with computers and telephones, there's no need to look good any more. But that way of thinking is a mistake: if we don't care how we look, why care how we think or act? Who do you really want to look like, anyway? James Bond or Richard Branson? </p> <p>We are not all blessed with equal amounts of charisma; some people will be fantastically successful, regardless of the clothes they wear. But most of us need all the help we can get, and dressing smartly and with style each morning can only bring a little extra confidence, which makes us happier and more effective in everything we do. </p> <p>All this 60s talk went out 40 years ago, Al. But don't worry - you can always hang with me. Still, I bet I get invited to more parties than you do. <br> Love, Tom </p> <p><strong> Dear Tom,</strong><br> Please forgive me for the pseudo-hippy language. It was to illustrate the laid-back style becoming prevalent not just in businesses like mine, but in more \"serious\" enterprises like Andersen. This stampede towards the casual has less to do with our growing use of telecoms and more to do with the growing antipathy towards the uniformity of groups of men in suits. If they look the same, it suggests that they think the same - the civil service, the military, the City of London in the 50s. In advertising agencies, the most smartly-attired people are the account handlers. Creative people often refer to them simply as \"suits\". It's a way to disparage them. They are seen as stuffed shirts, the enemies of creativity. Andersen knows business is hungry to foster individual and unconventional ways of looking at problems or, at the very least, to give the impression of doing so. </p> <p>Additionally, we've been hearing a lot about the feminisation of the workplace. Booted and suited in a razor-sharp whistle may well increase a chap's confidence and scream success with a capital S - but it can also damage the nurturing and inclusive environment that commerce is currently trying to foster. Suits are good for confrontation with employees and suppliers, but perhaps not so good for collaboration. </p> <p>It may depress you to know that the chairman of my advertising agency gave all his work suits to Oxfam three years ago, and now slobs around the office in sweatshirts and jumpers. So keen is he to deformalise attitudes that he will even balk at me calling him \"chairman\". <br> Keep sharing that love, <br> Al </p> <p><strong> Dear Al,</strong><br> At least we're in agreement about certain groups of men in suits: I, as much as anyone, have suffered from frustration at the hands of the grey-suit brigade. But I do believe my work to be an art, which couldn't survive without an ability to think creatively. To visit a bespoke tailor and to choose the cloth, style and tiniest details of a suit is a very individual approach to the interpretation of ideas. It is a long way from a visit to the quartermaster's stores for a demob suit. </p> <p>The point that I'm trying to make is this: I make clothes for some of the most charismatic and free-spirited individuals anyone could hope to meet - people who would never let themselves be constrained by a suit. Both of us know that jobsworths who gain pleasure from narrowmindedness will do so just as well in casual jackets and slacks as in the finest Savile Row suit. You say that a suit is a workplace uniform, but isn't the alternative just to switch to the uniform of the slob? Greyness would remain. We're all motivated to succeed, whatever our business: don't you think that, if wearing a smart suit were detrimental to free thought and fresh ideas, we'd have discovered this a little earlier? </p> <p>I'm confident that, if we have this same debate in 50 years, very little will have changed. In response to your chairman, who now slobs around the office, I'd say this: I have just finished making two suits for a partner of a very successful London advertising firm. When he put on the completed garments and looked in the mirror, he said simply: \"Image is everything.\" <br> Your call, <br> Tom </p> <p><strong> Dear Tom,</strong><br> Good points well made. I'll come clean with you: I do have a couple of bespoke suits. It was as much a pleasure to have them made as it has been wearing them. Having clothes that fit - really fit - is wonderful and whenever I don one of the suits, it sends my posture a couple of rungs up the evolutionary ladder. Both were made for the weddings of close friends. They helped me to make each event more important and acted as a sign of respect to my friends. </p> <p>On rare occasions, I'll put one on for work. These rare occasions tend to be times of very high stress, when I want to feel and appear impenetrable and powerful. It's as if I'm putting on a suit of armour, and it works for me. </p> <p>But I'd far rather look and feel approachable and open-minded. Being dressed up to the nines, however satisfying, doesn't deliver this. This may be one of the reasons why Andersen is relaxing its dress code. Business shouldn't be about doing battle and there can be a thin line between panache and posturing. </p> <p>Unlike your client, I don't believe image is everything. I think how we behave in business is really what we should be looking at. Being good is more important than looking good. Still, it sounds like he was over the moon with his new threads. <br> All the best, <br> Al</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Seamus Heaney won the \u00a321,000 Whitbread prize this week for his translation of Beowulf, he gave the credit to \"the anonymous master who composed Beowulf\". Heaney claimed to be only the \"worker\"; the major achievement was the work as originally composed. So who was the joint winner, responsible for the original \"gravity and force\" of the Anglo-Saxon poem? </p> <p>It seems a strange collaboration: the Irish poet who demurred at appearing under the heading British in a poetry anthology and the writer of a founding masterpiece of English literature. The writer of Beowulf came from the far north of England some time late in the first millennium, but he was writing about events and places far away. This heroic elegist wrote an epic about a Scandinavian hero and wars. Perhaps he was writing about his own progenitors after they had settled in the north, like Irish-Americans leaving their origins behind, yet with a strong nostalgia for them. </p> <p>The horror of violence that characterises Heaney's great poetry is evident in Beowulf. After the hero's violent actions, we are told that he rejoiced in his work; but the poet doesn't rejoice. The dominant tone is regret for the fate of the people: how they can be simultaneously motivated by compassion and vengeance, how their great capacities for loyalty come to naught. JRR Tolkien said the first 3,000 lines (the bulk of the poem) can be read as a long prelude to a dirge for the death of Beowulf, his society and its values. Heaney in pondering long over Beowulf must have heard echoes of the disintegration of civil values in his Northern Ireland. He also recognised a poet with his own extraordinary gift for language, the poet who greets God's creation so lyrically: \"How the Almighty had made the earth/a gleaming plain girdled with waters;/in His splendour He set the sun and the moon/to be earth's lamplight, lanterns for men,/and filled the broad lap of the world/ with branches and leaves; and quickened life/in every other thing that moved\". (Heaney's version). </p> <p>The anonymous poet had earlier collaborators. Several 19th-century poets reworked the great lament for the passing of human life, what came to be called \"the lament of the last retainer\". But Heaney restores a most eloquent voice: \"No trembling harp,/no tuned timber, no tumbling hawk/swerving through the hall, no swift horse/pawing the courtyard. Pillage and slaughter/ have emptied the earth of entire peoples.\" Here we hear the voice of a great imaginative writer. The mourners at Beowulf's funeral praise him as \"of all worldly kings, the most gracious to men, the gentlest and kindest to people, and the most eager for fame\". The poet's attachment to the life of society is evident in the poignancy with which he evokes its loss. Not that we can call the poet he with such certainty. It might be she, though not very probably. </p> <p>Some modern readers have returned to the 19th-century assignment of the poem to many writers, perhaps as many as six. Attempts were made to see different stylistic components in the poem: different poems almost. The 19th century wanted to replace the Romantic notion of \"the poet\", as with Homer, with the German idea of composition over time by the folk: the poem as a product of oral public culture. A series of disparate lays or short poems had come together into a complex but somewhat disconnected whole. Responsibility is divided differently in our time, but still denies the notion of the individual inspired genius. But mostly we hear in Beowulf now a voice consistent and exalted, and it is to this inspired single voice that Heaney has responded. </p> <p> The poet of Beowulf worked with what is now a dimly known amalgam of historical events (set in the 6th century), like a writer of the Celtic Revival working with medieval Irish legends and folklore. Stories of fratricide and vengeance are told side by side with sinister fairytales of dragons and humanoid sea-monsters. It would be interesting to know his Germanic sources, but only as we need to know the classical sources that Tennyson nodded to. As Heaney says, we don't know who Scyld Scefing is: less even than we know Yeats's Fergus, who ruled the shadows of the wood. But it doesn't matter because, like Yeats, the Beowulf-poet has a drive and conviction that sweeps the reader past wondering or misgiving. </p> <p>He describes the infernal landscape, where the monsters Grendel and his mother live, with the power of Dante: \"A mysterious land of wolf-slopes and windy headlands, a treacherous path where the mountain stream disappears under the spray of the cliffs, a flood under the ground.\" He evokes a world remote from social and natural values, where the hart pursued by hounds will turn at the edge of the ghastly mere and give up his life on the shore rather than plunge in. It is a world of symbolic evil of such depth that nobody, no matter how wise, can plumb it. </p> <p>The Beowulf-poet is above all a social writer. The ideal community at the start is the Danish Heorot, the great Hart-hall, where humane values of light and warmth and music shine in the surrounding darkness. Grendel and the other monsters are figures of the socially destructive. (John Gardner's version of Grendel had a brief vogue in the early Picador lists in the 70s, making the case for the anti-social). </p> <p>But we don't know exactly what kind of world the poet inhabited. Where did his learning come from, enabling him by some untraceable heritage to invite comparison with Virgil's watery Hell-entry? What audience was he addressing, with such knowledge of the Swedish and Danish and Jutish wars of the 6th century that the details could be left as elegant, suggestive hints? </p> <p> He is a bookish writer, even if much of his material has not been mediated through books but by great set-piece short narratives . He has a gift for elegant brevity and for the Germanic laconic (Grendel's lake \"was not a good place\"). With the precision of the Anglo-Saxon riddles, he compares the sword that melts to an icicle \"when the Father unties the bonds of frost, unwinds the water-fetters\". </p> <p>You can understand the appeal for Heaney when you read the stately A Ship of Death in Heaney's The Haw Lantern in 1987, which translates part of Beowulf's opening. But it is to the long-dead poet's profound humanism that Heaney, the most humane and social of writers, has principally responded. We can be confident that the poet of Beowulf would have been generous-spirited enough to be gratified to share a prize with the modern master of English poetry. Like the rest of Heaney's thankful readership, he would acknowledge that the Whitbread has gone to the right place, undivided. </p> <p>\u0095 Beowulf, translated by Seamus Heaney, is published by Faber, \u00a314.99</p>",

Heaney claimed to be only the \"worker\"; the major achievement was the work as originally composed. So who was the joint winner, responsible for the original \"gravity and force\" of the Anglo-Saxon poem? It seems a strange collaboration: the Irish poet who demurred at appearing under the heading British in a poetry anthology and the writer of a founding masterpiece of English literature. The writer of Beowulf came from the far north of England some time late in the first millennium, but he was writing about events and places far away. This heroic elegist wrote an epic about a Scandinavian hero and wars. Perhaps he was writing about his own progenitors after they had settled in the north, like Irish-Americans leaving their origins behind, yet with a strong nostalgia for them. The horror of violence that characterises Heaney's great poetry is evident in Beowulf. After the hero's violent actions, we are told that he rejoiced in his work; but the poet doesn't rejoice. The dominant tone is regret for the fate of the people: how they can be simultaneously motivated by compassion and vengeance, how their great capacities for loyalty come to naught. JRR Tolkien said the first 3,000 lines (the bulk of the poem) can be read as a long prelude to a dirge for the death of Beowulf, his society and its values. Heaney in pondering long over Beowulf must have heard echoes of the disintegration of civil values in his Northern Ireland. He also recognised a poet with his own extraordinary gift for language, the poet who greets God's creation so lyrically: \"How the Almighty had made the earth/a gleaming plain girdled with waters;/in His splendour He set the sun and the moon/to be earth's lamplight, lanterns for men,/and filled the broad lap of the world/ with branches and leaves; and quickened life/in every other thing that moved\". (Heaney's version). The anonymous poet had earlier collaborators. Several 19th-century poets reworked the great lament for the passing of human life, what came to be called \"the lament of the last retainer\". But Heaney restores a most eloquent voice: \"No trembling harp,/no tuned timber, no tumbling hawk/swerving through the hall, no swift horse/pawing the courtyard. Pillage and slaughter/ have emptied the earth of entire peoples.\" Here we hear the voice of a great imaginative writer. The mourners at Beowulf's funeral praise him as \"of all worldly kings, the most gracious to men, the gentlest and kindest to people, and the most eager for fame\". The poet's attachment to the life of society is evident in the poignancy with which he evokes its loss. Not that we can call the poet he with such certainty. It might be she, though not very probably. Some modern readers have returned to the 19th-century assignment of the poem to many writers, perhaps as many as six. Attempts were made to see different stylistic components in the poem: different poems almost. The 19th century wanted to replace the Romantic notion of \"the poet\", as with Homer, with the German idea of composition over time by the folk: the poem as a product of oral public culture. A series of disparate lays or short poems had come together into a complex but somewhat disconnected whole. Responsibility is divided differently in our time, but still denies the notion of the individual inspired genius. But mostly we hear in Beowulf now a voice consistent and exalted, and it is to this inspired single voice that Heaney has responded. The poet of Beowulf worked with what is now a dimly known amalgam of historical events (set in the 6th century), like a writer of the Celtic Revival working with medieval Irish legends and folklore. Stories of fratricide and vengeance are told side by side with sinister fairytales of dragons and humanoid sea-monsters. It would be interesting to know his Germanic sources, but only as we need to know the classical sources that Tennyson nodded to. As Heaney says, we don't know who Scyld Scefing is: less even than we know Yeats's Fergus, who ruled the shadows of the wood. But it doesn't matter because, like Yeats, the Beowulf-poet has a drive and conviction that sweeps the reader past wondering or misgiving. He describes the infernal landscape, where the monsters Grendel and his mother live, with the power of Dante: \"A mysterious land of wolf-slopes and windy headlands, a treacherous path where the mountain stream disappears under the spray of the cliffs, a flood under the ground.\" He evokes a world remote from social and natural values, where the hart pursued by hounds will turn at the edge of the ghastly mere and give up his life on the shore rather than plunge in. It is a world of symbolic evil of such depth that nobody, no matter how wise, can plumb it. The Beowulf-poet is above all a social writer. The ideal community at the start is the Danish Heorot, the great Hart-hall, where humane values of light and warmth and music shine in the surrounding darkness. Grendel and the other monsters are figures of the socially destructive. (John Gardner's version of Grendel had a brief vogue in the early Picador lists in the 70s, making the case for the anti-social). But we don't know exactly what kind of world the poet inhabited. Where did his learning come from, enabling him by some untraceable heritage to invite comparison with Virgil's watery Hell-entry? What audience was he addressing, with such knowledge of the Swedish and Danish and Jutish wars of the 6th century that the details could be left as elegant, suggestive hints? He is a bookish writer, even if much of his material has not been mediated through books but by great set-piece short narratives . He has a gift for elegant brevity and for the Germanic laconic (Grendel's lake \"was not a good place\"). With the precision of the Anglo-Saxon riddles, he compares the sword that melts to an icicle \"when the Father unties the bonds of frost, unwinds the water-fetters\". You can understand the appeal for Heaney when you read the stately A Ship of Death in Heaney's The Haw Lantern in 1987, which translates part of Beowulf's opening. But it is to the long-dead poet's profound humanism that Heaney, the most humane and social of writers, has principally responded. We can be confident that the poet of Beowulf would have been generous-spirited enough to be gratified to share a prize with the modern master of English poetry. Like the rest of Heaney's thankful readership, he would acknowledge that the Whitbread has gone to the right place, undivided. \u0095 Beowulf, translated by Seamus Heaney, is published by Faber, \u00a314.99",

But the great and honourable point in its favour is that, despite its landmark status, it resists the cosy embrace of heritage. There is not a whiff of the Tintagel tea rooms about it. Rather, Bintley and his superb design team (Peter J Davison sets; Peter Mumford lighting and Jasper Conran costumes) have relocated the legend to a postmodern timewarp. Davison's vast metal scaffolding allows the stage to move from generic, smoke-choked battle scene to minimalist court, while the rock in which Excalibur is planted glows like a slab of Kryptonite. Conran's costumes mix medieval fantasy and contemporary catwalk, with soldiers in bikers' leathers, knights in dinosaur skulls and pony-skin trousers, and women in exquisite fancy dress. </p> <p>The point of setting Arthur in this historical limbo is not only to tell the story freshly but also to universalise it as a study of power. Its concerns - that all great leaders have blood on their hands, that all just causes are complicated by evil and all individuals are trapped by larger destinies - remain today's concerns. So while Bintley gives due magical weight to Arthur's initiation into kingship via his miraculous seizing of Excalibur, the ballet is more interested in the deceit and violence that attend his rule. </p> <p>The ballet may end with Arthur's joyous wedding to Guinevere but the ceremony is juxtaposed with a film collage of children being shot: a slaughter of the innocents planned by Merlin to rid the kingdom of the infant Mordred - Arthur's nemesis. </p> <p>These are high aims, considered with high seriousness; but what is on stage is unfortunately less like a ballet than a high-class pageant. Stylish tableaux rattle past our eyes, adroitly taking in the detailed complexities of Bintley's libretto (to get a proper grasp of which you have to read seven pages of programme notes). But there is little that involves our brains or hearts. Apart from basic leitmotifs identifying the main characters, the choreography seems a dutiful afterthought. Neither the steps nor the mime look as if they've been imagined specially - rather as though they have been borrowed from the ballet library. </p> <p>So despite the hard-working efforts of the dancers, we know little about the characters they portray and we care even less - though there are a few outstanding exceptions, which show us what this ballet could have been like. In the shocking duet in which Morgan Le Fay sexually assaults Arthur, Bintley's choreography creates images available to no other medium. Tiny Laetitia Muller is transformed into a female demon, a flying succubus, who whirls around Arthur, high on her points and jabs at him viciously with her groin.

      "body": "<p>There is probably only one place in South Africa where you will see white men hauling crates on to lorries while black labourers paid to do the job lounge under a tree. But then the remote, almost comatose town of Orania likes to pretend that it is not in South Africa at all. It is a founding principle of the dilapidated settlement on the banks of the Orange river that only whites - Afrikaners specifically - can work within its borders. The black men on the trucks collecting sweet melons from the town's farm for shipment to Britain are astonished to find themselves waved aside. </p> <p>But that is the paradox of Orania. It is almost so much the old South Africa that it is something new. Orania was a ghost town reborn nine years ago as the nucleus of an Afrikaner homeland, a \"volkstaat\", shortly after Nelson Mandela's release from prison sounded the death knell for white rule. The new trekkers have settled in some of the most barren and sparsely populated land in the country, hoping that it will grow into an independent Boer republic stretching from the banks of the Orange river to the South Atlantic. </p> <p>But the South African government is redrawing municipal boundaries across the country and Orania is to be incorporated with two black townships more than 20 miles away, and the all-white town is about to get a black mayor. \"I suppose it'll mean taxes,\" said Carel Boshoff, the town's leading Afrikaner philosopher and grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, and black homelands. \"We'll have to pay to educate them in the township. This is what we were trying to get away from. This is a setback, but I don't think it'll destroy us.\" </p> <p>Orania was built in the 60s by the water department to house families of men building irrigation canals to parched Northern Cape farmland. On one side of town the department constructed airy bungalows beside concrete roads. The open-air swimming pool and Dutch Reformed church stand sentry either side of the gateway to the rugby pitches. Over the hill the road turns to a track. There the water department built the remainder of Orania, the quarter for the black workers, called Little Happiness. The houses are crammed together in a jumble. The department did not extend the electricity supply from the \"white\" area. Orania was abandoned in 1981 after the canals were complete. </p> <p>The town withered in the scorching heat for a decade until it caught the eye of the volkstaaters. A consortium of wealthy backers headed by Verwoerd's surviving family bought the town and turned it into a private company. That way the shareholders - the residents - can discriminate about who they let in. The new settlers built a pipeline from the river to irrigate the fields, and set about creating jobs with small factories making shoes and ironwork. They also erected a memorial to Hendrik Verwoerd on a hillock above the church. </p> <p>Verwoerd is pervasive. It is not just that his wife, daughter, grandson and in-laws have all decamped to Orania where the family dominate political life. The pride of the only guest house is the HF Verwoerd room. Guests sleep under a large portrait of the most vilified man in modern South Africa. On the opposite wall hangs a certificate to his honourary membership of the Voortrekkers, a nationalist version of the Scouts. There is even talk of moving Verwoerd's grave from Pretoria. </p> <p>But apartheid's architect is more divisive in Orania than might be imagined. \"Even in town Verwoerd is a controversial figure,\" said Dr John Streydom, who moved there two years ago. \"Some people think he might be a bit of an albatross.

Today, the racism is less overt. \"The others\" and \"different nations\" have taken the place of more offensive epithets, at least in front of outsiders. Orania attracts two kinds of settlers. There are those who simply want to escape the changing South Africa, and those who dream of the volkstaat. Just about anyone who wants to live in the town has to say they believe in the latter when they appear before Carel Boshoff and the council, which scrutinises potential residents. \"Shareholders are asked if they ascribe to the broad concept of Afrikaner freedom. Are you self-sufficient? Are you going to be part of an economy or are you going to live off other peoples' labour? Of course you get people who express it in terms of racial categorisation. That's what South Africans grew up with,\" Boshoff says. </p> <p>Yet the vision is faltering. Orania has failed to attract the thousands of Afrikaners its planners thought would be scrambling for places. There is room for 10,000 people but just 650 have moved in. Others have tried Orania and left, driven out by the hardship of scraping a living in a barren town with too few real jobs or simply overwhelmed by the oppressive politics of conformity to an imagined ideal of the distant past. And those who stay are not always as strongly committed to a volkstaat as some would like. \"At the council meeting the other day one of the guys said 'The gardens are coming along very nicely' and one of the others said 'That's the problem.

It goes unmentioned that Verwoerd also despised Jews. The first apartheid-era prime minister, DF Malan, once stood on Cape Town docks in a futile bid to turn back a shipload of European Jews fleeing Hitler's Germany. These days, Orania's leaders make periodic visits to Israel to learn its lessons. The town imported \u00a31m of milking equipment for its 500 cows, making it one of the most modern dairies in South Africa and a source of considerable pride which every visitor is shown.

The school has a 100% pass rate in its school leaving exam, although it favours an independent version because of the dif fering interpretations of history between Orania and the South African education department. The volkstaat curriculum prefers not to dwell on recent events given so much attention in state schools. \"If the learners come across something liberal or strange in an exam it can be a bit difficult,\" Anna Boshoff says. </p> <p>Among the professionals willing to give Orania a try is Christiaan van Zyl, a young architect who is held up as the epitome of the pioneering spirit because he is building himself a house of straw. Mr van Zyl says similar homes using straw bales instead of bricks have stood for more than a century in America, a country he has come to Orania to escape. \"I came here for the Afrikaner way of life.

      "bodyText": "There is probably only one place in South Africa where you will see white men hauling crates on to lorries while black labourers paid to do the job lounge under a tree. But then the remote, almost comatose town of Orania likes to pretend that it is not in South Africa at all. It is a founding principle of the dilapidated settlement on the banks of the Orange river that only whites - Afrikaners specifically - can work within its borders. The black men on the trucks collecting sweet melons from the town's farm for shipment to Britain are astonished to find themselves waved aside. But that is the paradox of Orania. It is almost so much the old South Africa that it is something new. Orania was a ghost town reborn nine years ago as the nucleus of an Afrikaner homeland, a \"volkstaat\", shortly after Nelson Mandela's release from prison sounded the death knell for white rule. The new trekkers have settled in some of the most barren and sparsely populated land in the country, hoping that it will grow into an independent Boer republic stretching from the banks of the Orange river to the South Atlantic. But the South African government is redrawing municipal boundaries across the country and Orania is to be incorporated with two black townships more than 20 miles away, and the all-white town is about to get a black mayor. \"I suppose it'll mean taxes,\" said Carel Boshoff, the town's leading Afrikaner philosopher and grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, and black homelands. \"We'll have to pay to educate them in the township. This is what we were trying to get away from. This is a setback, but I don't think it'll destroy us.\" Orania was built in the 60s by the water department to house families of men building irrigation canals to parched Northern Cape farmland. On one side of town the department constructed airy bungalows beside concrete roads. The open-air swimming pool and Dutch Reformed church stand sentry either side of the gateway to the rugby pitches. Over the hill the road turns to a track. There the water department built the remainder of Orania, the quarter for the black workers, called Little Happiness. The houses are crammed together in a jumble. The department did not extend the electricity supply from the \"white\" area. Orania was abandoned in 1981 after the canals were complete. The town withered in the scorching heat for a decade until it caught the eye of the volkstaaters. A consortium of wealthy backers headed by Verwoerd's surviving family bought the town and turned it into a private company. That way the shareholders - the residents - can discriminate about who they let in. The new settlers built a pipeline from the river to irrigate the fields, and set about creating jobs with small factories making shoes and ironwork. They also erected a memorial to Hendrik Verwoerd on a hillock above the church. Verwoerd is pervasive. It is not just that his wife, daughter, grandson and in-laws have all decamped to Orania where the family dominate political life. The pride of the only guest house is the HF Verwoerd room. Guests sleep under a large portrait of the most vilified man in modern South Africa. On the opposite wall hangs a certificate to his honourary membership of the Voortrekkers, a nationalist version of the Scouts. There is even talk of moving Verwoerd's grave from Pretoria. But apartheid's architect is more divisive in Orania than might be imagined. \"Even in town Verwoerd is a controversial figure,\" said Dr John Streydom, who moved there two years ago. \"Some people think he might be a bit of an albatross. I consider myself neutral. Verwoerd wasn't that bad. He had a fair amount of goodwill for blacks.

This too is a story of a bunch of eccentrics rebelling in their country's capital. </p> <p>Uzupis, or the Republic of Angels as it has been dubbed, comprises only 148 acres and around 120 residents.

In Uzupis the trigger was Frank Zappa, the gifted but undeniably weird American rock star. </p> <p>Nine years ago Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union, leaving a lot of empty plinths that had previously been occupied by statues of Lenin, Marx and their regional disciples. An obvious question remained: what to do with the empty plinths? Saulius Paukstys, a civil servant and member of the Vilnius bohemian set, saw the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition. He founded the Frank Zappa Fan Club and commissioned a socialist realist sculptor to create a statue of Zappa on a patch of land in front of a children's hospital in the centre of the city. \"We were desperate to find a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom,\" Paukstys recalls. He now holds the post of national security chief. </p> <p>At first the authorities criticised the plan, particularly after discovering that Zappa was a bit of a leftie. \"They said: 'What has he got to do with Lithuania anyway?' We said: 'Nothing really.' Then someone convinced them that Zappa had Jewish features and seeing as Jewish history is very important to Lithuania, they plumped for that.\" </p> <p>The statue was erected in downtown Vilnius five years ago. The most famous of modern Bohemians, Czech president Vaclav Havel, was invited to the unveiling, where a military brass band played Zappa hits. Membership of the fan club ballooned; a radio station allocated airtime for a weekly Zappa broadcast, which included doses of Zappa philosophy; and a Zappa Love Letter Club was set up to bring Vilnius's lonely hearts together. </p> <p>The fan club and the city's artistic community are practically synonymous, so when the artists started drifting back to their old haunt of Uzupis, Zappa was the natural candidate for patron saint. And last spring, when the local artists and young people decided to take a stand against the city council's neglect of Uzupis, he was the figure they rallied behind. \"The spirit of Zappa made us see that independence from Moscow was not enough and persuaded us to declare independence from the rest of Vilnius,\" says Paukstys. </p> <p>\"We're trying to relearn the smell of identity,\" agrees Roman Lileikis, president of Uzupis and one of Lithuania's leading musicians and film-makers. The smell may be rather pungent. The name Uzupis means \"the other side of the river\" and the waterway has long served as a natural border - the area remained cut off from the old town until two bridges were erected in the 16th century. For hundreds of years it was the home of Russian and Jewish residents but during the war almost all of its population disappeared, leaving empty homes which were occupied by prostitutes and bandits. </p> <p>When I visited the republic, having first obtained the visa stamp in my passport (a hand with a red hole to symbolise the blisters of a worker), it was not hard to track down the founding fathers, president and all, who were sitting sipping Trejos Devynerios - a Lithuanian mead made from 27 different roots and grasses - in their regular haunt, Uzupio Kavine. The place's menu is as ironic as the republic itself: Monmarto salad, Uzupio ruins and Bohemia roast. </p> <p>Apart from the artists there was an engineer, a doctor and several business people, most of whom admitted they had been highly sceptical about independence, but who now fondly embraced Uzupian values and hoped their children would do the same. </p> <p>President Lileikis, a Kenneth Branagh lookalike dressed in a fisherman's jumper, poured more mead and explained how he founded Uzupio Pingvinai (Uzupis Penguins) a few years ago, to preserve all things Uzupian, including its creative and community spirit. He was a natural choice for president and is so dedicated to the task of making the republic work that he has put a successful career making commercials on ice. </p> <p>\"We're trying to energise a community by asserting our indepen dence,\" Lileikis says. \"It's very different from the independence gained in '91, but we're trying to foster the same spirit so that people can make things happen for themselves. That's a trait they lost through 70 years of oppression.\" </p> <p>Uzupis certainly appears to be a unique place in Vilnius. No other part of the capital has a proper sense of community. The aim is to draw the rest of the city into the spirit by holding carnivals and pyrotechnic shows on the river, as well as open-house art actions. As the ultimate act of satire, the republic shares its national feast day with April Fool's day. </p> <p>\"We're taking the term carnivalesque back to its medieval origins, when it was used to turn the status quo upside down for a while and shake people out of themselves,\" says Vytautas Kalanauskas, an avant-garde artist who looks a bit like Picasso and who lived in Uzupis in the 50s before the authorities moved him on. He returned in 1984, and says the artistic community, having spent years using \"Aesop language\" in its work so as to outwit the authorities, is \"now trying to get its own tongue back'.' </p> <p>Vilnius has fancied itself as a cultural centre of Europe ever since its postwar poet Oskar Milosz had a vision of Vilnius as a northern Athens of the 21st century. \"We think the term is a bit bombastic and pompous now, but we can still dream that it will become reality,\" says Linas Paulasukis, editor of the cultural magazine Siaures Atenai, or Northern Athens. Uzupis, Paulasukis believes, fits into the right mould. \"They have a fine vision to create a community atmosphere through art,\" he says, \"but maybe it's more important as a social phenomenon than as an artistic movement. It helps the Lithuanians to learn how to open up.\" </p> <p>The question now is how far the process will go.

The talks between Mr Livingstone and the transport minister Lord Whitty, who was Labour's general secretary until 1994, have covered the content of Labour's mayoral manifesto, who would be deputy mayor, and government plans for the future of London Underground. The prime minister yesterday reiterated his support for the former health secretary Frank Dobson as London Labour party members began voting in what has become a bitter election contest. But it is understood that discussions between Downing Street and Millbank over how to deal with a Livingstone victory have intensified in recent weeks, as the Brent East MP's commanding poll lead has shown little sign of slipping under the official onslaught. Among those said to have been involved in talks about how to handle a possible official Labour campaign for Livingstone as London mayor are Lord Whitty's departmental boss, the deputy prime minister John Prescott, the chancellor Gordon Brown, Labour's general secretary Margaret McDonagh and Philip Gould, Mr Blair's pollster and adviser. Labour insiders said yesterday that Lord Whitty met Mr Livingstone to hammer out the terms of an accommodation with the party leadership earlier this month, despite hopes that Mr Dobson might still beat him in the electoral college.

He had a gaping wound in his lower stomach and there was a lot of blood'.\" Jeremy Whales, the former mayor of Cheltenham, paid tribute to Mr Pennington, describing him as an outstanding man and a born fighter. \"He was a courageous man, a fighter, long before this tragedy. He would never walk away from a fight. If I could describe him in one word I would call him a tiger,\" he said. Liberal Democrats at Westminster last night expressed their horror at the attack. Party leader Charles Kennedy said: \"I am shocked and horrified by this news. Members of parliament make themselves available to all their constituents. It is tragic that an MP and his staff, carrying out their duties, should be subjected to an appalling attack of this nature.\" Local Lib Dem executive member and former councillor Steve Harvey said: \"Everyone is totally shocked and appalled. Nigel was doing his ordinary Friday evening surgery. Perhaps someone who had been to Nigel for help and not got it may have taken it to an extreme.\" Mr Jones, 51, is not a prominent Commons figure, but an affable backbencher and sports and beer enthusiast. The father of three took his Cheltenham seat unexpectedly in the 1992 general election after running against John Taylor. Labour MP Fraser Kemp last night called for new guidelines to help protect MPs and their staff. The MP for Washington and Houghton, who was a Labour party employee in the West Midlands when a Labour councillor was raped in a con stituency surgery, said: \"Jack Straw should talk to chief constables about issuing guidelines in terms of safety and advice, not exclusively for MPs but for their staff who are vulnerable at work.\" He added: \"MPs do not always do surgery work themselves - only today, for example, a Friday debate in the Commons will have meant that all over the country surgeries would have been conducted by staff.\" The majority of MPs do not use an appointments system at their surgeries, simply advertising the hours they will be available in local newspapers. MPs were given no guidelines on security, except in exceptional cases such as when racist or other organisations threatened to send letter bombs, he said.",

Although best known to television audiences as Brian Quigley, the scheming local businessman in the BBC1 series Ballykissangel, his acting credits cover an extraordinary range of work on stage, radio, film and television in Britain and Ireland. <br> Tony was born in French Town, Roscommon, on the Sligo-Leitrim border, where his father was a police sergeant. Later, the family moved to Churchtown, Dublin, when his father was stationed there in the late 1950s. He went to University College, Dublin, and later, took acting courses with Brendan Smyth in Dublin, while working briefly with a US oil company based in Dublin.<br> He began his acting career with small independent groups in Dublin, before moving to London where he played a number of roles in fringe theatre. I vividly recall him, dressed in a silver suit in a small theatre in Islington, singing Stewart Parker's pastiche of a 1970s Eurovision Contest song, Der Zig Zag Zong, in the play Catchpenny Twist. It stole the show. <br> Tony was passionate about the theatre and loved working on the stage. There were a number of roles at the Royal Court, London, including an exceptional performance in Ron Hutchinson's Rat In The Skull, and at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, where his performance in The Gigli Concert was an emotional tour-de-force. <br> His television curriculum vitae lists no fewer than 81 titles. They include films such as The Hen House and The Nightwatch, directed by Danny Boyle, and his first major series role as the complex policeman John Deakin in the BBC crime drama, Between the Lines.<br> He was also a brilliant radio actor. Only last week BBC Radio 4 audiences had the pleasure of hearing him read a series of ghost stories. I understand from the young producer who worked with him that Tony's kindness to inexperienced raido producers had remained unchanged since I first worked with him in the late 1970s. <br>Outside his dedication to acting, it was clear that Tony's family and close friends were the most important things to him. He rarely took breaks from work but, when he did, it was often to spend time with his artist wife Sally in their house in France. He had three children from his first marriage - one of whom, Susannah, played the secretary, Joy, in Channel 4's Drop The Dead Donkey - and three from his second. <br> Tony's strength as an actor came from his qualities as a man. He had a natural authority, warmth, humour and intelligence, which informed all the roles he played. Anyone who worked with him recognised his uncanny ability to find something oddly heroic in all the manifestations of human weakness. Even when the characters he portrayed were cruel, ruthless or pathetic, one sensed they had an equal capacity for humour and tragedy. Perhaps this explains the exceptional range of the parts he played. <br> His creation of Quigley in Ballykissangel, justifying a lucrative franchise for confessionals containing fax machines on moral grounds, was funny because he somehow managed to show hypocrisy as something ludicrous, self-revealing and deeply human. <br> His portrayal of Michael Moran, in the BBC adaptation of John McGahern's Amongst Women, achieved the almost impossible feat of making us feel sympathy for a tyrannical patriarch who would otherwise have appeared merely a monster. It was a role that brought Doyle much deserved acclaim, including many major awards and nominations. <br>He was about to star in a pilot for a series that had been specially written for him - McCready and Daughter. He would have been great in it; in Tony's hands, a part didn't look like acting. On film-sets, his presence assured stability and integrity. His friendship was hugely valued.</p> <p><b>Tony Garnett writes:</b> Some deaths are unsurprising, even expected. Tony Doyle's was like a kick in the stomach. We were just doing the deal with his agent for his sixth outing as Brian Quigley, in Ballykissangel. Tony was the Jack Nicholson of British actors. A tough man to deal with - he knew his worth - but once done, the most consummate professional. <br> However warm, convivial (and late) the night before, he was always on the set on time, spruce, bright-eyed and ready, without temperament or side. In an age when some young actors mistake tabloid celebrity for talent, his impeccable professional manners were an example. You didn't mess with him. Who would want to? He always delivered.<br> In the 1990s, I was a privileged colleague through three years of Between The Lines and five of Ballykissangel. The roles were very different, but his subtlety, quiet authority and tart comedy timing were the same. As the bent detective and Machiavellian fixer, Deakin, he was cold and cynical, a man who believed in nothing, but enjoyed life as a game of bluff and double bluff. As Quigley, the entrepreneurial fixer, he brought warmth and an understanding of human weakness to the character. Rarely can a villain have been so loved by so many. Quigley playing with his grandson are scenes of great tenderness.<br> Tony was my kind of actor. Less was more, and you could never catch him doing it. He had presence. It will take a long time to fade.</p> <p>Tony Doyle, actor, born 1942; died January 28 2000</p>",

His portrayal of Michael Moran, in the BBC adaptation of John McGahern's Amongst Women, achieved the almost impossible feat of making us feel sympathy for a tyrannical patriarch who would otherwise have appeared merely a monster. It was a role that brought Doyle much deserved acclaim, including many major awards and nominations. He was about to star in a pilot for a series that had been specially written for him - McCready and Daughter. He would have been great in it; in Tony's hands, a part didn't look like acting. On film-sets, his presence assured stability and integrity. His friendship was hugely valued. Tony Garnett writes: Some deaths are unsurprising, even expected. Tony Doyle's was like a kick in the stomach. We were just doing the deal with his agent for his sixth outing as Brian Quigley, in Ballykissangel. Tony was the Jack Nicholson of British actors. A tough man to deal with - he knew his worth - but once done, the most consummate professional. However warm, convivial (and late) the night before, he was always on the set on time, spruce, bright-eyed and ready, without temperament or side. In an age when some young actors mistake tabloid celebrity for talent, his impeccable professional manners were an example. You didn't mess with him. Who would want to? He always delivered. In the 1990s, I was a privileged colleague through three years of Between The Lines and five of Ballykissangel. The roles were very different, but his subtlety, quiet authority and tart comedy timing were the same. As the bent detective and Machiavellian fixer, Deakin, he was cold and cynical, a man who believed in nothing, but enjoyed life as a game of bluff and double bluff. As Quigley, the entrepreneurial fixer, he brought warmth and an understanding of human weakness to the character. Rarely can a villain have been so loved by so many. Quigley playing with his grandson are scenes of great tenderness. Tony was my kind of actor. Less was more, and you could never catch him doing it. He had presence. It will take a long time to fade. Tony Doyle, actor, born 1942; died January 28 2000",

Within hours, the 18-year-old musician was told he was out of a job. The last national symphony orchestra in sub-Saharan Africa was to close.</p> <p>On Thursday he played his second and last concert with the NSO, which was, he said, \"the highlight of my very short career\".</p> <p>\"Nobody else can say that at 18 they have played with a national symphony orchestra,\" he added. \"I've got a whole load of experience in the past week but it's very disappointing. It makes you wonder why you do it at all if there's no orchestra.\"</p> <p>The orchestra has lived hand to mouth for years, but finally closed when a potential sponsor backed out, leaving the orchestra 10m rand (\u00a31m) short.</p> <p>Some see its demise as evidence of the post-apartheid government's emphasis on popular black culture over \"white, elitist\" music - certainly it showed no enthusiasm to save the NSO, but the orchestra has never received government funds.</p> <p>Others, including some of its own members, say it failed to adapt rapidly enough to the changing political realities of South Africa by recruiting more black players and developing a higher profile in townships.</p> <p>The musicians played a final concert for free, partly as an act of defiance, partly in the hope a white knight might appear. \"The workers of the orchestra you see here tonight are currently unemployed,\" the audience was told.</p> <p>Before the performance, one of the flautists, Malane Hofmeyr-Burger, was handing out envelopes to other members of the company. She had no idea what was in them until she opened her own. It was the official redundancy notice and a payoff cheque of only \u00a3200, less than a week's salary.</p> <p>\"I will go on practising. There are not so many opportunities to play, so you must make your own,\" she said. \"I'll try and establish an ensemble with others here. We must start creating culture. South Africans are not used to the notion of giving money but we must if these things are to survive.\"</p> <p>Mr Hitzeroth, who was talent-spotted while playing with the national youth orchestra, did not even qualify for an envelope. He will go back to studying music at Port Elizabeth university.</p> <p>\"It's a long process to get blacks into the orchestra,\" he said. \"They've been supporting me for three years. It's not like you can throw in millions of rand and have 10 black guys in the orchestra. You have to groom the players to a particular standard. If we lose the orchestra now, who's going to groom the new musicians?\"</p> <p>The NSO was once funded by the South African Broadcasting Corporation but this ended in 1997, when the cash-strapped corporation was reorganised.</p> <p>Finding new sponsors is not easy, but the overwhelmingly white complexion of the orchestra has not helped. There are only two black musicians, including Mr Hitzeroth, and a third of the players are foreign born, mostly from Bulgaria and Russia.</p> <p>Don Ezard, a Briton, took over management of the orchestra in August when it was already in deep trouble.</p> <p>\"I think the perception has been that this orchestra was exclusively white, and I think that used to be correct.

      "bodyText": "Alex Hitzeroth joined South Africa's national symphony orchestra as its first black trombonist little more than a week ago. Within hours, the 18-year-old musician was told he was out of a job. The last national symphony orchestra in sub-Saharan Africa was to close. On Thursday he played his second and last concert with the NSO, which was, he said, \"the highlight of my very short career\". \"Nobody else can say that at 18 they have played with a national symphony orchestra,\" he added. \"I've got a whole load of experience in the past week but it's very disappointing. It makes you wonder why you do it at all if there's no orchestra.\" The orchestra has lived hand to mouth for years, but finally closed when a potential sponsor backed out, leaving the orchestra 10m rand (\u00a31m) short. Some see its demise as evidence of the post-apartheid government's emphasis on popular black culture over \"white, elitist\" music - certainly it showed no enthusiasm to save the NSO, but the orchestra has never received government funds. Others, including some of its own members, say it failed to adapt rapidly enough to the changing political realities of South Africa by recruiting more black players and developing a higher profile in townships. The musicians played a final concert for free, partly as an act of defiance, partly in the hope a white knight might appear. \"The workers of the orchestra you see here tonight are currently unemployed,\" the audience was told. Before the performance, one of the flautists, Malane Hofmeyr-Burger, was handing out envelopes to other members of the company. She had no idea what was in them until she opened her own. It was the official redundancy notice and a payoff cheque of only \u00a3200, less than a week's salary. \"I will go on practising. There are not so many opportunities to play, so you must make your own,\" she said. \"I'll try and establish an ensemble with others here. We must start creating culture. South Africans are not used to the notion of giving money but we must if these things are to survive.\" Mr Hitzeroth, who was talent-spotted while playing with the national youth orchestra, did not even qualify for an envelope. He will go back to studying music at Port Elizabeth university. \"It's a long process to get blacks into the orchestra,\" he said. \"They've been supporting me for three years. It's not like you can throw in millions of rand and have 10 black guys in the orchestra. You have to groom the players to a particular standard. If we lose the orchestra now, who's going to groom the new musicians?\" The NSO was once funded by the South African Broadcasting Corporation but this ended in 1997, when the cash-strapped corporation was reorganised. Finding new sponsors is not easy, but the overwhelmingly white complexion of the orchestra has not helped. There are only two black musicians, including Mr Hitzeroth, and a third of the players are foreign born, mostly from Bulgaria and Russia. Don Ezard, a Briton, took over management of the orchestra in August when it was already in deep trouble. \"I think the perception has been that this orchestra was exclusively white, and I think that used to be correct. But you can't say that any more. We are actively recruiting black players. Last Friday we were to audition two black string players but . . .\" he trailed off. The NSO has played in support of the Nelson Mandela children's fund, as backing for black choirs and at the popular nation-building concerts of South African music held every year for the past decade. Some of the players visited Soweto every week as part of an educational programme in six black schools. But the orchestra really extended itself into township life only in the past two years. And Mr Ezard conceded that not all the players were keen to participate. \"There may be some reservations but only based on lack of experience. Those musicians who've been into Soweto are very enthusiastic,\" he said. While some of the orchestra's supporters have accused the government of letting the NSO die in favour of promoting black culture, the National Arts Council says it is hardly in a position to help. Its annual budget is only \u00a32.5m. It would take nearly half of that to keep the NSO afloat. The arts minister, Ben Ngubane, said the government \"cannot just pull 10m rand out of a hat\".

He said the response was \"totally unsatisfactory\", adding: \"Somehow I don't think these orchestras are interested in talking to each other. They each want to go their own way.\" South Africa has three other professional orchestras, in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. They each receive subsidies from their respective city councils and provincial government, although the Cape Town Philharmonic has warned that it may have to close without a big cash injection. But none of the regional or local authorities was willing to back the NSO, because it was a national organisation. Some in the orchestra still believe it can be revived. But Mr Ezard does not hold out much hope. \"I think it's gone,\" he said.",

If such a meeting were held, Austria would be represented by Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the acting foreign minister who stands to become chancellor if negotiations with Mr Haider succeed. Diplomats said that while an EU meeting was unlikely on constitutional grounds, the issue could be discussed by leaders of the Socialist International, whose members include a majority of the EU's centre-left governments. Glyn Ford, a Labour MEP, yesterday asked the EU president, Romano Prodi, if he was prepared to use EU treaties to suspend a far-right Austria \"in the interest of protecting the rights of third-country nationals and minority groups\". Austria displayed shock yesterday to the international reaction.\"Austria is not a Nazi country!\" blared the headline in the pro-Haider Neue Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular newspaper. Austria is now waking up to the fact that Mr Haider, whose party finished second in October's elections, could cause serious damage to its international image. While Austria's president, Thomas Klestil, tries to avoid the sort of international embarrassment Austria faced when Kurt Waldheim came to power in the mid-1980s, public opinion is largely in favour of letting Mr Haider \"have a go\". \"We need a breath of fresh air in Austria and that's just what Dr Haider offers,\" said Helene, a retired nurse. Most feel that the critical reaction from abroad is unwarranted. \"The foreigners should shut their mouths!\" said Gerte, a market trader. \"We don't interfere with their affairs, so why should they stick their noses into ours?\" More than one in three Austrians favour a coalition between the conservatives and the far right, according to opinion polls. A further third want new elections, which Mr Haider is likely to call if the current negotiations break down. Mr Haider's personal popularity is around 37%. Thomas Vasek, a journalist with the current affairs weekly Profil, said Mr Haider seemed to symbolise something modern. \"He has differentiated himself from the Austrian politics of the last decades and represents a turning point and he makes the other politicians look old-fashioned.\" Wolfgang Neugebauer, head of the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance , a government-funded body which works closely with the Jewish community, has been unsuccessfully sued for libel several times by Mr Haider for calling him a \"rightwing extremist and anti-semite\" whose party \"contributed to the reputation of Austria as a Nazi country\". Prof Neugebauer said: \"I have no faith in the democratic principles of Haider. I cannot predict what will happen if he comes to power, but I certainly have my fears,\" he said. \"Austria, like any other country has its fair share of anti-foreigner sentiment, but Haider has cleverly taken advantage of this.\" The centre was founded to tackle the issues of Austria's Nazi past. \"But increasingly we're having to deal with the present, and a rising anti-foreigner, rightwing, extremist tendency which Haider has stoked,\" said Prof Neugebauer. \"J\u00f6rg is celebrating his triumph now,\" one of Mr Haider's close advisers said. \"For years the political establishment treated him like a leper. Now the conservatives are being forced to come to him on bended knee. And now he's perfectly at liberty to shut the door on them.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bloodied but unbowed after the battle of Seattle, the forces of globalisation are fighting back - but gently. Nowhere is this clearer than in Davos, the Swiss mountain resort where Tony Blair yesterday joined other global political leaders and businessmen for their annual brainstorming session about the future of the world economy. The prime minister captured the mood of the World Economic Forum - which represented 60-80% of global industrial production -by echoing the call of Pascal Lamy, the European Union trade commissioner, for a new round of global trade talks before the end of the year. Failure to do so in Seattle had been a setback, he said, but it did not mean open markets and free trade were wrong. \"The worst thing we could do for developing countries would be to shelve the trade liberalisation agenda and sit back while trade barriers are re-erected around the globe.\" The way to succeed, however, was not to bludgeon civil society into submission, but use the power of argument to convince it of the benefits of free trade. \"We cannot afford another Seattle but nor can we afford to postpone the massive gains that a successful new trade round would deliver,\" Mr Blair said. He is not the only one preaching the message of reaching out to the campaign groups, trade unions and others who eye globalisation as a despoiler of the environment and a destroyer of jobs. The summit host, Klaus Schwab, founder and president of the WEF, and Donald Johnston, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, were singing from the same hymn sheet. In his opening address, Mr Schwab announced two initiatives to counter the impression that Davos is just a celebration of money-making by the rich industrialised countries. To make up for the damage inflicted on the clear Swiss mountain air by the mass arrival of corporate jets, Mr Schwab said the forum would plant some trees in Mexico. His second initiative involved setting up a fund to reward social entrepreneurs with substantial cash prizes. While both are small gestures, they are designed to send signals that the lessons of Seattle are being learned. Even before Seattle, the OECD was forced to ditch plans for a multinational agreement on investment in the face of campaign groups' internet-based opposition. Now the OECD is using the internet to publish the draft of a new code of conduct for multinational businesses, to ensure everyone is included in the discussion. The big question, however, is whether these moves by the bankers of Davos amount to anything more than gestures. Mr Blair suggested rich countries could demonstrate that they did by offering poor countries tariff-free access to their markets without expecting anything in return. The Seattlites await their response.",

Occasionally, he's playful and endearing, such as when he captures Brad Pitt with an awkward bear-hug and yells an abrupt: \"How are ya, Brad?\" But equally, his manner is quite unnerving when he collides with a journalist by the bar, and the conversation instantly breaks down into stunted exclamations, laced with Jordan's characteristic \"hmmmms\" and \"you knows\". </p> <p>In contrast, the company of his loquacious pony-tailed producer, Stephen Woolley, is easeful: \"I just don't think that Neil has quite mastered the art of polite conversation,\" he says. \"He finds it really difficult to talk about the weather, and all that usual stuff. Most things are completely peripheral to his vision.\" </p> <p>Of all the characteristics and influences that come together in Neil Jordan, it is this enigmatic reserve that is perhaps the most dominant and intriguing. \"He knows very well how to work that to his benefit,\" says Hugh Linehan, a film critic for the Irish Times who has worked on Jordan films. \"He will give you that blank look intentionally, to try to make you feel awkward. I have seen him do that on the set. He uses it to force people to come up with things.\" It seems particularly effective with actors, who find in Jordan's careful reticence a delicate and unimposing guiding hand: \"He hasn't got a fixed idea of what he wants,\" says Ralph Fiennes, who plays Bendrix in The End Of The Affair, \"he's open to the journey of performance, and his manner is very easy. He's never in the least imposing. I just think that he's very collaborative, very open.\" </p> <p>Even more vital for a filmmaker in search of funding, producers view Jordan's lack of frills as unalloyed dedication: \"He is a person of talent and passion,\" says David Geffen, producer of Interview With The Vampire and Michael Collins. \"He understands how to solve problems. He is not temperamental or difficult to work with.\" </p> <p>It might even be said that in Jordan's work, in the career choices he has made and the dogged determination he has shown, and even the material he has produced, there is also the mark of his restive persona and its attendant curiosity. Though a pioneer of Irish film, he has maintained a distance from the nascent Irish Film Industry that has now sprung up around him. He has opted to make films with a visual daring unknown among his fellow Irish directors and of an almost startling diversity, from big Hollywood blockbusters - such as Interview With The Vampire, to highly intimate pieces - The Miracle, to his current adaptation of The End Of The Affair, by the quintessentially English novelist Graham Greene. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't demean Neil even by saying that he is the first international Irish filmmaker,\" says the critic Alexander Walker. \"He is simply an international filmmaker who has his preferred subjects and areas of interest dealing with the Irish character.\" </p> <p>Practically all of Jordan's films, even some of the more conventional genre pictures, have a brooding, off-kilter, unclassifiable quality, or as his friend, the novelist John Banville, puts it: \"the great thing about Neil's movies is that they are all slightly sick.\" As is probably fitting for a director whose first ever sex scene - in Angel - involved a saxophonist and an underage deaf mute, Jordan's films make constant forays into lonely sexual byways. In The Miracle, he gave us jittery Oedipal yearning; in Mona Lisa, it was Soho sleaze; and, most famously, in The Crying Game, it was the love affair between a transvestite and an IRA man. </p> <p>There is even something vaguely eerie in the constant repetition of Jordan 's favourite decorative motifs: the jangling tunes of the beach-front marquee and the gaudy ambience of the seaside town. \"I can never end a story until I get it to the sea,\" Jordan claims. </p> <p>Though he identifies himself as \"not particularly political\", and though he feels that there is nothing wrong with the idea of republicanism, his capacity to whip up political controversy with the sheer, and almost naive boldness of his political dramas has remained undiminished. For its depiction of a musician's descent into terrorism, Angel was lambasted by nationalists for \"reinforcing British stereotypes of the Irish as prone to violence\". The Crying Game was attacked for what was considered a favourable portrait of an IRA character, and the biopic Michael Collins, which dealt with the controversial Sinn F\u00e9in leader of the 1920s, was attacked by Nationalists, Unionists and the right-wing English press for historical inaccuracy and for being a piece of \"neo-fascist propaganda\" for the IRA. </p> <p>\"I found a lot of the argument very untruthful,\" Jordan says. \"These were areas we never intended to get into. All we were tying to do was use the language of the gangster movie to tell the story.\" Overall, however, he feels he has achieved what he set out to do with his political films: \"I think they had some impact. Now it's all about change, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Neil Jordan was born on Febru ary 25, 1950, in Rosses Point, County Sligo, the second child of Michael and Angela Jordan. A few years later, the family relocated to Clontarf on the north coast of Dublin Bay, consolidating a fascination with the sea that Jordan continues to indulge both in his life and art. Life in the Jordan household was relatively free, though rather strict. Michael Jordan was an educationist involved in broadening the Irish school curriculum and was writing a thesis on the adverse effects of different kinds of popular children's literature. While he forbade his own children to read comics, he kept a pile in his study as part of his research. </p> <p>He forbade television, and he limited cinema-going to \"once every two weeks, whereas all my friends would go twice a week\", Jordan says. Any artistic stimulation the young boy had was provided in classes run by his mother, an artist, by his father's library, which was crammed with Joyce and Graham Greene, and through playing the guitar. </p> <p>In school, Jordan generally performed badly: \"I was a slow learner,\" he says, \"which was ironic because my father was an educationist. I was a living refutation of all of his theories. The only thing I had any interest in was literature.\" After attending a local primary school in Clontarf, Jordan moved on to St Paul's College in Raheny, a mid-level private school. </p> <p>\"He was a very reserved boy, but in no way a loner; he always mixed with people,\" remembers his English teacher, Father Joseph McCann. \"Though his English compositions were quite conventional for a boy of that age, if you looked at them again it was always possible to see some new angle.\" In his final years, he won the school president's prize for a short story entitled Sunday. </p> <p>At University College, Dublin, Jordan studied medieval literature - his thesis was on the lives of the saints - and English literature, which he didn't enjoy: \"I didn't understand how they thought it possible to dissect a book like a piece of meat. It seemed far too clinical.\" He maintained something of a low profile, and though he was drawn to the college drama society, always remained somewhat apart from the crowd. </p> <p>\"He was a very good-looking guy, with long black hair and sallow skin, and he reminded me of Yeats as a young man,\" remembers filmmaker and journalist Michael Sheridan, who was a contemporary of Jordan's. \"He was a withdrawn, shy type of person who didn't mix very very easily; like the rest of us in college, his social graces were limited. But he had an air of mystery which people recognised and drew them to him.\" </p> <p>During his college years he met Vivienne Shields, a law student who would soon become his wife: \"We just met at the university one evening, as you do,\" Jordan remembers. \"All my friends were getting married, so I thought that I had better do so as well.\" </p> <p>When he left college in 1971, it was almost impossible to get a job: \"With the degree I had, I was basically unemployable. If you go back to 1972-74 in Ireland, there was nothing to do, no jobs to be had.\" And so, at the first opportunity, he headed off with his wife to London, and worked on a series of labouring jobs, writing short stories in his spare time. </p> <p>He returned to Dublin in 1973, for the funeral of his wife's aunt, decided to stay, and picked up occasional jobs as nightwatchman and teacher. While Vivienne found work in law, Jordan minded the kids and wrote. \"I suppose you could say I was a bit of a house-husband,\" he says. \"I couldn't actually find a job. Vivienne was the one who was earning the money.\" </p> <p>Around this time, though, Jordan teamed up with the future film director Jim Sheridan and his brother Peter to put on a number of theatre projects around Dublin. Sheridan remembers they met at a lecture, \"and I think that within three months we were doing a show called Journal Of A Hole, in the Project arts centre.\" Another piece they performed was Oedipus Rex, with Jordan playing Tiresias. \"The reviews were all terrible,\" says Sheridan, \"but Neil was quite brilliant as Tiresias. All he had to do was come out and exert his personality rather than act, and at that he was very good, very powerful.\" </p> <p>It was also at this time that Jordan began to rent out his talents as a musician. It would turn out to be a formative experience. He joined a group called Eilis to play saxophone and banjo: \"Neil certainly brought a distinctive flavour to the material,\" remembers Niall Stokes, founder of the band. \"We did stuff that had a vaudeville feel, where the banjo worked well. He wasn't a virtuoso but he was a good player.\" </p> <p>Many of Jordan's experiences with Eilis would form the basis of his first film, Angel, the story of a musician who swaps his saxophone for a gun. \"I once arranged a gig in the lunatic asylum in Portlaoise,\" remembers Stokes. \"While we were doing our sound check, the patients started to filter into the hall, watching us as we tuned up. It was a very strange experience, and one that ended up directly in the film.\" </p> <p>Throughout all of this, Jordan was writing, producing the stories that would eventually be published in 1976 as Night In Tunisia, with the help of a group that he had co-founded, called the Writer's Co-Op. The stories were immersed in the imagery of Jordan's childhood: sad and lonely beachfront vistas, unsuccessful musicians, all shot through with shimmering, subterranean sexuality. </p> <p>The opening story, Last Rites, is particularly bleak and brutal piece about the suicide of a labourer in a public bath. \"Incredibly savage,\" he reflects now, \"It must have just been the way I felt, I suppose, as if I hadn't any prospects. I was working in that place and I was going in to shower there every day. That idea just grew from that.\" The collection picked up the Guardian Fiction Prize, signalling for Jordan a bright literary future. </p> <p>However, at this time he was also being pulled in another direction. He began writing for television and radio, producing some episodes of a dramatised biography of Sean O'Casey, and a couple of TV and radio plays. Jordan attracted the attention of the film-maker John Boorman, who says: \"I became aware of him through the short stories; they had a very cinematic quality. I recognised that he had a vision and a talent.\" As a result, Boorman took the unprecedented step of diverting \u00a325,000 from the budget of his film Excalibur so that Jordan could make a documentary about its making. </p> <p> At the same time, he set about producing a new script for himself to direct, the work that would become Angel, the story of a Northern Irish musician's descent into violence. After showing the script to Boorman, Jordan convinced him to come on board as executive producer. However, Boorman was also chairman of the Irish Film Board, which would provide a chunk of the funding. </p> <p>Though Boorman resigned his position before the decision was made to fund Angel, this apparent conflict was to kick off the first, though not the last, major controversy of Jordan's career. Boycotts were organised and irate meetings held: \"There was one meeting when everyone was blackballing Jordan,\" Michael Sheridan remembers, \"and he is reputed to have left in tears.\" </p> <p>For the lead role, Jordan cast an actor well known in Dublin theatre circles named Stephen Rea, who would become his long-time collaborator. \"He was monosyllabic, and I didn't say anything at all,\" Rea remembers, \"so it would have been difficult for us to know each other very well. It's really only over the years that I could say I knew him, he really was very shy and very difficult to talk to.\" Rea remembers tension on the set of Angel: \"I had a sense that a lot of the crew rather resented that someone so inexperienced was directing a movie.\" </p> <p>When the film was shown at Cannes, to attract video distributors, it became a late-night sensation: \"It wasn't in competition: it was showing in some backstreet cinema at midnight,\" remembers Stephen Woolley. \"I saw it and thought it was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to buy it for my own film company, Palace, which was then still quite small.\" </p> <p>After a battle with Channel 4, which initially didn't want to release Angel for cinema distribution, it ran in Woolley's Scala cinema in London, and became a critical hit which drew modest audiences. But the film did lead to a meeting between Woolley and Jordan that would change both of their lives: \"Neil flew over to London and he stayed with me. I had a copy of his short stories which I had read. We just started talking about stuff, what kind of movies we liked and that was it.\" </p> <p>Jordan showed him the script that would later become The Crying Game, then titled The Soldier's Wife. But since a rather similar film - Cal - had just been released, Channel 4 mooted the idea of adapting Angela Carter's post-feminist short story, The Company Of Wolves. The resulting film turned out to be a hit in the UK, bigger than Ghandi or Splash. </p> <p>Then, in 1986, came the picture that really brought Jordan to public attention for the first time: Mona Lisa. He had hatched the idea after he read a crime report about a prostitute's \"chauffeur\". From a treatment by Jordan, the screen-writer David Leland wrote the first draft of the script, and Jordan produced a second draft. </p> <p>It was sent to Bob Hoskins, who had first attracted Jordan's atten tion in The Long Good Friday, but he initially turned down the central role. Then late one night, Hoskins recalls, he got a knock on the door and opened it to find a bedraggled Irishman enquiring rather brusquely: \"Why don't you want to do my script, what's wrong with it?\" Hoskins tried to explain that the central character was simply too violent, no more than a pimp, and that if Jordan came up with a second draft, then he might reconsider. Jordan went off to produce the rewrites, and Hoskins took the part. </p> <p>It was after the critical and box-office success of Mona Lisa that Jordan made the first and most major of his wrong turnings. First, he decided to go to Hollywood; and second, he decided to do a comedy. High Spirits was from the offset something of a bad idea: \"Never let me do a comedy again,\" Jordan said after it. The result, a mish-mash starring Steve Gutenberg, Daryl Hannah and Peter O'Toole, was a disaster. </p> <p>The studio moved in at the last minute to re-cut the film, pulling Jordan from his holiday in order to bully him into making the necessary alterations. Immediately afterwards, he turned to We're No Angels, a script that David Mamet had written for himself to direct. Yet again, though not quite of the egregious quality of High Spirits, the film misfired and didn't do well at the box office. </p> <p>After We're No Angels failed, Jordan recoiled from the Hollywood experience to make The Miracle, with his then girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo playing an actress whose son falls in love with her when she returns to Ireland after many years away. Since the breakup of his marriage to Vivienne Shields, he had a number of girlfriends until hooking up with D'Angelo around 1986, in what has been described as a \"tempestuous\" relationship. </p> <p>By the time of The Miracle, complications had arisen in the form an affair Jordan had had with an architect named Mary O'Donaghue, when they produced a child. \"The shoot degenerated into soap opera,\" recalls one observer. \"It all came out in a very public way and it proved very difficult for all involved.\" For D'Angelo, it meant the end of the relationship. \"I can remember that I really couldn't give myself to that role because of events that were going on around me in my personal life,\" she says, refusing to elaborate. Shortly after the split, Jordan got together with his personal assistant Brenda Rawn, his current partner. </p> <p>The Miracle was also a commercial failure, making Jordan's next project, The Crying Game, very difficult for producer Stephen Woolley to sell. Even when funding had been put together from a patchwork of sources, the difficulties were not over: \"I didn't have enough cash, we had started the film and we couldn't pay anyone,\" recalls Woolley. \"I was using the money from my cinema, the Scala, or maxing out my credit cards.\" </p> <p>To add to the complications, Jordan and Woolley were living under the same roof throughout: \"We would just use a cup in the morning when we got up. Neither of us ever washed up. There were hundreds of cups everywhere. We couldn't take our own company, so it was quite intense.\" </p> <p>At first, The Crying Game failed to find a major distributor, and played at a limited number of cinemas in England. Jordan was now seriously talking about giving up filmmaking and going back full time to novels. Then, having refused to contribute to the funding, Miramax suddenly decided to pick up the film's US distribution, and it became the surprise hit of 1992, transforming the way that arthouse pictures were viewed in the industry, and eventually grossing about $70m. It was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay, for which Jordan was famously late picking up the golden statue. </p> <p>\"I was waiting in the bar and suddenly everyone was yelling 'you have got to get up on stage'.\" As an excuse, he told the billions of viewers that he had been in the bathroom. \"He thought that waiting in the bar would seem too Irish,\" explains Rawn, \"but in LA, being in the bathroom had even worse connotations.\" </p> <p>Winning the Oscar began an entirely new phase in Jordan's career. Until then he had been pretty much written off as a major force, but now the offers came flooding in. His first choice was to launch himself into a project that had been brewing since the early 80s: the biopic of Michael Collins. However, even after the success of The Crying Game, no Hollywood studio was willing to risk the necessary multimillion-pound budget for a film about a man who was essentially an Irish terrorist. </p> <p>So, Jordan returned to Hollywood, at the request of David Geffen, to make the $60m Interview With The Vampire, based on the cult novel by Anne Rice. Much to Rice's chagrin, the film was to star Tom Cruise as Lestat, the lead role. Slated by the critics, the film ended up making $250m world-wide. In Hollywood terms it turned Jordan into a big hitter. At the same time, he brought out an elliptical novel called Sunrise With Sea Monster, which dealt with a young man returning from the Spanish civil war, a startling contrast to the overblown gore and indulgence of Interview. </p> <p>For Jordan, though the film may not have been his greatest artistic success, its commercial triumph enabled him to start work on Michael Collins. The script had originally been commissioned by David Puttnam in the early 80s, but it languished as a rival version, which was to star Kevin Costner, constantly threatened to beat it to the screen. However, around 1995, when Costner's project finally collapsed, and the IRA ceasefire made the prospect of doing the film far more palatable, the money finally came through. Jordan returned to the script and completed it within weeks. </p> <p>Liam Neeson remembers how he got the title role: \"He had seen me do a production of Brian Friel's play Translations. He asked to meet me and we met on a Sunday afternoon in 1984. He said he wanted me to play Collins and that it might be a long difficult road. I began researching as much of Collins as I could and the bug got under my skin.\" </p> <p>Right from the offset, however, the project was destined to be controversial. Collins had been one of Ireland's most contentious figures, a man who invented modern urban guerrilla warfare and helped \"bring the British Empire to its knees\" in Ireland, but had done so with great brutality. To add to his curious position in the country's mythology, he had also been the genius behind partition, which had created Northern Ireland and sparked the Irish civil war of 1922-23. </p> <p>Shooting began in January 1996, at a breakneck pace. In one of the most astonishing gestures of support that any nation could offer a film project, 5,000 Irish extras turned up for the first day of shooting, none being paid and many being expected to bring their own costumes. However, almost as soon as the film was out of post-production, the controversy began. The points that were most objected to were: showing that the British used tanks on the first Bloody Sunday, August 22, 1920; the introduction of a meeting with Eamon De Valera, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, before Collins's assassination in 1922; the cruelly accurate depiction of De Valera by Alan Rickman; and the combining of a number of characters into one. </p> <p>It was these contradictions, however, that Jordan set out to explore: \"One reason why I wanted to make Michael Collins was because he was actually a very contradictory figure - the figure that republicans loathed. Yet he was the most successful exponent of physical force that ever existed here. The guy gave rise to all of these contradictions and I thought that it was very fascinating.\" The film went on to take more at the box office than any other in the history of Irish cinema. </p> <p>After Michael Collins, Jordan set about making what many regard as his most successful film on an artistic level, the adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel The Butcher Boy. And then, true to his history of unpredictability, he moved on to make In Dreams, a curious psychothriller involving apples and starring Annette Bening, which was critically panned in the US and did very little business in Europe. </p> <p>Jordan had been itching to make a film of The End Of The Affair for many years. And though it failed to pick up any of the four Golden Globes it was nominated for last week, it is likely to be in contention for Oscars. However, what is most remarkable about the film is the way Jordan has made Greene's concerns his own: the Catholic imagery, the possibility of spirituality, even the religious theorising that bung up the end of Greene's novel, are all given a sparkling visual dimension. </p> <p>And in a move that is sure to raise a few eyebrows, the film even makes it to the sea: \"When I re-read the book, I just thought that it would make a wonderful movie, that the love affair could be told from two viewpoints. And the themes are really not all that different from my other work. What comes up in my films is I'm kind of interested in the point where rationality breaks down and doesn't explain things any more.\" <br><strong>Life at a glance: Neil Jordan </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> February 25 1950, Rosses Point, County Sligo. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> St Paul's College, Raheny; University College, Dublin (BA 1971). </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1971<strong> </strong> Vivienne Shields (two daughters, Sarah, Anna).

By the lamentably low standards of such movie industry junkets, it's a fairly lively affair. The small but vocal Irish contingent seems to have injected into the frantic jocularity of the liggers and the mid-level execs an air of genuine good cheer. Even the celebrities, who normally evaporate after 25 minutes, are still nattering away contentedly: a radiant Julianne Moore is talking babies with Jordan's partner Brenda, Ralph Fiennes is expounding on a horseback trek he plans to take across Mongolia, and Brad Pitt, who worked with Jordan on Interview With The Vampire and is here with his burly minder out of solidarity, chats up the director's daughter Anna, 20, who looks uncannily like her father, but with kohl and piercings. Only Jordan himself remains resolutely detached, flitting morosely around the room or sitting uneasily in some corner, drumming with his fingertips on the table, staring passionately into the middle distance. Occasionally, he's playful and endearing, such as when he captures Brad Pitt with an awkward bear-hug and yells an abrupt: \"How are ya, Brad?\" But equally, his manner is quite unnerving when he collides with a journalist by the bar, and the conversation instantly breaks down into stunted exclamations, laced with Jordan's characteristic \"hmmmms\" and \"you knows\". In contrast, the company of his loquacious pony-tailed producer, Stephen Woolley, is easeful: \"I just don't think that Neil has quite mastered the art of polite conversation,\" he says. \"He finds it really difficult to talk about the weather, and all that usual stuff.

The only thing I had any interest in was literature.\" After attending a local primary school in Clontarf, Jordan moved on to St Paul's College in Raheny, a mid-level private school. \"He was a very reserved boy, but in no way a loner; he always mixed with people,\" remembers his English teacher, Father Joseph McCann. \"Though his English compositions were quite conventional for a boy of that age, if you looked at them again it was always possible to see some new angle.\" In his final years, he won the school president's prize for a short story entitled Sunday. At University College, Dublin, Jordan studied medieval literature - his thesis was on the lives of the saints - and English literature, which he didn't enjoy: \"I didn't understand how they thought it possible to dissect a book like a piece of meat. It seemed far too clinical.\" He maintained something of a low profile, and though he was drawn to the college drama society, always remained somewhat apart from the crowd. \"He was a very good-looking guy, with long black hair and sallow skin, and he reminded me of Yeats as a young man,\" remembers filmmaker and journalist Michael Sheridan, who was a contemporary of Jordan's. \"He was a withdrawn, shy type of person who didn't mix very very easily; like the rest of us in college, his social graces were limited. But he had an air of mystery which people recognised and drew them to him.\" During his college years he met Vivienne Shields, a law student who would soon become his wife: \"We just met at the university one evening, as you do,\" Jordan remembers. \"All my friends were getting married, so I thought that I had better do so as well.\" When he left college in 1971, it was almost impossible to get a job: \"With the degree I had, I was basically unemployable. If you go back to 1972-74 in Ireland, there was nothing to do, no jobs to be had.\" And so, at the first opportunity, he headed off with his wife to London, and worked on a series of labouring jobs, writing short stories in his spare time. He returned to Dublin in 1973, for the funeral of his wife's aunt, decided to stay, and picked up occasional jobs as nightwatchman and teacher. While Vivienne found work in law, Jordan minded the kids and wrote. \"I suppose you could say I was a bit of a house-husband,\" he says. \"I couldn't actually find a job. Vivienne was the one who was earning the money.\" Around this time, though, Jordan teamed up with the future film director Jim Sheridan and his brother Peter to put on a number of theatre projects around Dublin. Sheridan remembers they met at a lecture, \"and I think that within three months we were doing a show called Journal Of A Hole, in the Project arts centre.\" Another piece they performed was Oedipus Rex, with Jordan playing Tiresias. \"The reviews were all terrible,\" says Sheridan, \"but Neil was quite brilliant as Tiresias. All he had to do was come out and exert his personality rather than act, and at that he was very good, very powerful.\" It was also at this time that Jordan began to rent out his talents as a musician. It would turn out to be a formative experience. He joined a group called Eilis to play saxophone and banjo: \"Neil certainly brought a distinctive flavour to the material,\" remembers Niall Stokes, founder of the band. \"We did stuff that had a vaudeville feel, where the banjo worked well. He wasn't a virtuoso but he was a good player.\" Many of Jordan's experiences with Eilis would form the basis of his first film, Angel, the story of a musician who swaps his saxophone for a gun. \"I once arranged a gig in the lunatic asylum in Portlaoise,\" remembers Stokes. \"While we were doing our sound check, the patients started to filter into the hall, watching us as we tuned up. It was a very strange experience, and one that ended up directly in the film.\" Throughout all of this, Jordan was writing, producing the stories that would eventually be published in 1976 as Night In Tunisia, with the help of a group that he had co-founded, called the Writer's Co-Op. The stories were immersed in the imagery of Jordan's childhood: sad and lonely beachfront vistas, unsuccessful musicians, all shot through with shimmering, subterranean sexuality. The opening story, Last Rites, is particularly bleak and brutal piece about the suicide of a labourer in a public bath. \"Incredibly savage,\" he reflects now, \"It must have just been the way I felt, I suppose, as if I hadn't any prospects. I was working in that place and I was going in to shower there every day. That idea just grew from that.\" The collection picked up the Guardian Fiction Prize, signalling for Jordan a bright literary future. However, at this time he was also being pulled in another direction. He began writing for television and radio, producing some episodes of a dramatised biography of Sean O'Casey, and a couple of TV and radio plays. Jordan attracted the attention of the film-maker John Boorman, who says: \"I became aware of him through the short stories; they had a very cinematic quality. I recognised that he had a vision and a talent.\" As a result, Boorman took the unprecedented step of diverting \u00a325,000 from the budget of his film Excalibur so that Jordan could make a documentary about its making. At the same time, he set about producing a new script for himself to direct, the work that would become Angel, the story of a Northern Irish musician's descent into violence. After showing the script to Boorman, Jordan convinced him to come on board as executive producer. However, Boorman was also chairman of the Irish Film Board, which would provide a chunk of the funding. Though Boorman resigned his position before the decision was made to fund Angel, this apparent conflict was to kick off the first, though not the last, major controversy of Jordan's career. Boycotts were organised and irate meetings held: \"There was one meeting when everyone was blackballing Jordan,\" Michael Sheridan remembers, \"and he is reputed to have left in tears.\" For the lead role, Jordan cast an actor well known in Dublin theatre circles named Stephen Rea, who would become his long-time collaborator. \"He was monosyllabic, and I didn't say anything at all,\" Rea remembers, \"so it would have been difficult for us to know each other very well. It's really only over the years that I could say I knew him, he really was very shy and very difficult to talk to.\" Rea remembers tension on the set of Angel: \"I had a sense that a lot of the crew rather resented that someone so inexperienced was directing a movie.\" When the film was shown at Cannes, to attract video distributors, it became a late-night sensation: \"It wasn't in competition: it was showing in some backstreet cinema at midnight,\" remembers Stephen Woolley. \"I saw it and thought it was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to buy it for my own film company, Palace, which was then still quite small.\" After a battle with Channel 4, which initially didn't want to release Angel for cinema distribution, it ran in Woolley's Scala cinema in London, and became a critical hit which drew modest audiences. But the film did lead to a meeting between Woolley and Jordan that would change both of their lives: \"Neil flew over to London and he stayed with me. I had a copy of his short stories which I had read. We just started talking about stuff, what kind of movies we liked and that was it.\" Jordan showed him the script that would later become The Crying Game, then titled The Soldier's Wife. But since a rather similar film - Cal - had just been released, Channel 4 mooted the idea of adapting Angela Carter's post-feminist short story, The Company Of Wolves. The resulting film turned out to be a hit in the UK, bigger than Ghandi or Splash. Then, in 1986, came the picture that really brought Jordan to public attention for the first time: Mona Lisa. He had hatched the idea after he read a crime report about a prostitute's \"chauffeur\". From a treatment by Jordan, the screen-writer David Leland wrote the first draft of the script, and Jordan produced a second draft. It was sent to Bob Hoskins, who had first attracted Jordan's atten tion in The Long Good Friday, but he initially turned down the central role. Then late one night, Hoskins recalls, he got a knock on the door and opened it to find a bedraggled Irishman enquiring rather brusquely: \"Why don't you want to do my script, what's wrong with it?\" Hoskins tried to explain that the central character was simply too violent, no more than a pimp, and that if Jordan came up with a second draft, then he might reconsider. Jordan went off to produce the rewrites, and Hoskins took the part. It was after the critical and box-office success of Mona Lisa that Jordan made the first and most major of his wrong turnings. First, he decided to go to Hollywood; and second, he decided to do a comedy. High Spirits was from the offset something of a bad idea: \"Never let me do a comedy again,\" Jordan said after it. The result, a mish-mash starring Steve Gutenberg, Daryl Hannah and Peter O'Toole, was a disaster. The studio moved in at the last minute to re-cut the film, pulling Jordan from his holiday in order to bully him into making the necessary alterations. Immediately afterwards, he turned to We're No Angels, a script that David Mamet had written for himself to direct. Yet again, though not quite of the egregious quality of High Spirits, the film misfired and didn't do well at the box office. After We're No Angels failed, Jordan recoiled from the Hollywood experience to make The Miracle, with his then girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo playing an actress whose son falls in love with her when she returns to Ireland after many years away. Since the breakup of his marriage to Vivienne Shields, he had a number of girlfriends until hooking up with D'Angelo around 1986, in what has been described as a \"tempestuous\" relationship. By the time of The Miracle, complications had arisen in the form an affair Jordan had had with an architect named Mary O'Donaghue, when they produced a child. \"The shoot degenerated into soap opera,\" recalls one observer. \"It all came out in a very public way and it proved very difficult for all involved.\" For D'Angelo, it meant the end of the relationship. \"I can remember that I really couldn't give myself to that role because of events that were going on around me in my personal life,\" she says, refusing to elaborate. Shortly after the split, Jordan got together with his personal assistant Brenda Rawn, his current partner. The Miracle was also a commercial failure, making Jordan's next project, The Crying Game, very difficult for producer Stephen Woolley to sell. Even when funding had been put together from a patchwork of sources, the difficulties were not over: \"I didn't have enough cash, we had started the film and we couldn't pay anyone,\" recalls Woolley. \"I was using the money from my cinema, the Scala, or maxing out my credit cards.\" To add to the complications, Jordan and Woolley were living under the same roof throughout: \"We would just use a cup in the morning when we got up. Neither of us ever washed up. There were hundreds of cups everywhere. We couldn't take our own company, so it was quite intense.\" At first, The Crying Game failed to find a major distributor, and played at a limited number of cinemas in England. Jordan was now seriously talking about giving up filmmaking and going back full time to novels. Then, having refused to contribute to the funding, Miramax suddenly decided to pick up the film's US distribution, and it became the surprise hit of 1992, transforming the way that arthouse pictures were viewed in the industry, and eventually grossing about $70m. It was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay, for which Jordan was famously late picking up the golden statue. \"I was waiting in the bar and suddenly everyone was yelling 'you have got to get up on stage'.\" As an excuse, he told the billions of viewers that he had been in the bathroom. \"He thought that waiting in the bar would seem too Irish,\" explains Rawn, \"but in LA, being in the bathroom had even worse connotations.\" Winning the Oscar began an entirely new phase in Jordan's career. Until then he had been pretty much written off as a major force, but now the offers came flooding in. His first choice was to launch himself into a project that had been brewing since the early 80s: the biopic of Michael Collins. However, even after the success of The Crying Game, no Hollywood studio was willing to risk the necessary multimillion-pound budget for a film about a man who was essentially an Irish terrorist. So, Jordan returned to Hollywood, at the request of David Geffen, to make the $60m Interview With The Vampire, based on the cult novel by Anne Rice. Much to Rice's chagrin, the film was to star Tom Cruise as Lestat, the lead role. Slated by the critics, the film ended up making $250m world-wide. In Hollywood terms it turned Jordan into a big hitter. At the same time, he brought out an elliptical novel called Sunrise With Sea Monster, which dealt with a young man returning from the Spanish civil war, a startling contrast to the overblown gore and indulgence of Interview. For Jordan, though the film may not have been his greatest artistic success, its commercial triumph enabled him to start work on Michael Collins. The script had originally been commissioned by David Puttnam in the early 80s, but it languished as a rival version, which was to star Kevin Costner, constantly threatened to beat it to the screen. However, around 1995, when Costner's project finally collapsed, and the IRA ceasefire made the prospect of doing the film far more palatable, the money finally came through. Jordan returned to the script and completed it within weeks. Liam Neeson remembers how he got the title role: \"He had seen me do a production of Brian Friel's play Translations. He asked to meet me and we met on a Sunday afternoon in 1984. He said he wanted me to play Collins and that it might be a long difficult road. I began researching as much of Collins as I could and the bug got under my skin.\" Right from the offset, however, the project was destined to be controversial. Collins had been one of Ireland's most contentious figures, a man who invented modern urban guerrilla warfare and helped \"bring the British Empire to its knees\" in Ireland, but had done so with great brutality. To add to his curious position in the country's mythology, he had also been the genius behind partition, which had created Northern Ireland and sparked the Irish civil war of 1922-23. Shooting began in January 1996, at a breakneck pace. In one of the most astonishing gestures of support that any nation could offer a film project, 5,000 Irish extras turned up for the first day of shooting, none being paid and many being expected to bring their own costumes. However, almost as soon as the film was out of post-production, the controversy began. The points that were most objected to were: showing that the British used tanks on the first Bloody Sunday, August 22, 1920; the introduction of a meeting with Eamon De Valera, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, before Collins's assassination in 1922; the cruelly accurate depiction of De Valera by Alan Rickman; and the combining of a number of characters into one. It was these contradictions, however, that Jordan set out to explore: \"One reason why I wanted to make Michael Collins was because he was actually a very contradictory figure - the figure that republicans loathed. Yet he was the most successful exponent of physical force that ever existed here. The guy gave rise to all of these contradictions and I thought that it was very fascinating.\" The film went on to take more at the box office than any other in the history of Irish cinema. After Michael Collins, Jordan set about making what many regard as his most successful film on an artistic level, the adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel The Butcher Boy. And then, true to his history of unpredictability, he moved on to make In Dreams, a curious psychothriller involving apples and starring Annette Bening, which was critically panned in the US and did very little business in Europe. Jordan had been itching to make a film of The End Of The Affair for many years. And though it failed to pick up any of the four Golden Globes it was nominated for last week, it is likely to be in contention for Oscars. However, what is most remarkable about the film is the way Jordan has made Greene's concerns his own: the Catholic imagery, the possibility of spirituality, even the religious theorising that bung up the end of Greene's novel, are all given a sparkling visual dimension. And in a move that is sure to raise a few eyebrows, the film even makes it to the sea: \"When I re-read the book, I just thought that it would make a wonderful movie, that the love affair could be told from two viewpoints. And the themes are really not all that different from my other work. What comes up in my films is I'm kind of interested in the point where rationality breaks down and doesn't explain things any more.\" Life at a glance: Neil Jordan Born: February 25 1950, Rosses Point, County Sligo.

      "body": "<p> Those of you with long memories may recall a BBC2 documentary called Close Up from around this time last year. Focusing on four ex-pat British screenwriters snuffling after paydirt in the sun-kissed Hollywood badlands, it featured \u00d1 at some length \u00d1 a gratingly cocksure fop by the name of Sacha Gervasi.</p> <p>Only Sacha, as his every gratingly cocksure word and gesture bawled from the rooftops, was a wannabe no more. Having successfully peddled his back-of-a-napkin big idea past the green light, he was now major league, a made guy, a pro. </p> <p>And all this, he explained with a nonchalant smirk, had been achieved with a pitch about a hairdresser.</p> <p>At least that\u00d5s what he said. What he meant, of course, was that it was about a hairdresser! A hairdresser! Not just someone who cuts hair, but a hairdresser! A big, flouncy, camp, blowsy hairdresser! Can you spot the difference?</p> <p>Well, one game-for-a-laugh exec did, and the result is the ha-ha-hilariously titled The Big Tease, starring \u00d1 for those with even longer memories \u00d1 Craig Ferguson, onetime egregious stand-up Bing Hitler and latterly the latest in the long line of fine British comic talent to make it large across the pond (Tracey Ullman). Plot-wise, Ferguson appears as an effete Scottish hairdresser (!) adrift in LA after arriving for the prestigious Platinum Scissors award (nice one Sacha), there\u00d5s a cameo from David Hasselhoff and, hmmm, that\u00d5s about it. So far, so harmless. The only thing which rankles about The Big Tease is its implicit self-satisfaction in being about, oh, you know. In the trailer, for example, you\u00d5ll find Ferguson delivering a monologue wherein \u00d1 after an amusing hairdressing-related pastiche of Taxi Driver \u00d1 he tacitly points out what a brilliantly novel concept our man Sacha has come up with: \"There have been many great hairdressing movies in Hollywood history,\" he mugs, \"like Shampoo\u00c9\"</p> <p>At which point Bing (as was) trails off, at a loss, his silence designed to illustrate the yawning cinematic void he, Sacha Gervasi and David Hasselhoff are ready to fill (sorry, I\u00d5m probably not doing it justice \u00d1 it\u00d5s really very funny).</p> <p>Sadly, however, Ferguson\u00d5s spiel ignores three salient facts, the first being that, in the shape of Summer Of Sam and Stigmata, there are two films already on release involving hairdresser heroes/heroines. The second, meanwhile, is that even if there were only a single similar opus in the Tinseltown archives, that\u00d5s no reason for a follow-up (there\u00d5s only ever been one press-magnate-and-sledge flick, but that doesn\u00d5t mean we need another with a camp Glaswegian press magnate and his camp Glaswegian sledge).</p> <p>And the third? The third is that Shampoo is too good to be mentioned in the same breath as The Big Tease. Because, when people talk about the golden age of 70s film-making, this \u00d1 as much as Altman, Cassavetes et al\u00d1 is what they\u00d5re on about.

      "bodyText": "Those of you with long memories may recall a BBC2 documentary called Close Up from around this time last year. Focusing on four ex-pat British screenwriters snuffling after paydirt in the sun-kissed Hollywood badlands, it featured \u00d1 at some length \u00d1 a gratingly cocksure fop by the name of Sacha Gervasi. Only Sacha, as his every gratingly cocksure word and gesture bawled from the rooftops, was a wannabe no more. Having successfully peddled his back-of-a-napkin big idea past the green light, he was now major league, a made guy, a pro. And all this, he explained with a nonchalant smirk, had been achieved with a pitch about a hairdresser. At least that\u00d5s what he said. What he meant, of course, was that it was about a hairdresser! A hairdresser! Not just someone who cuts hair, but a hairdresser! A big, flouncy, camp, blowsy hairdresser! Can you spot the difference? Well, one game-for-a-laugh exec did, and the result is the ha-ha-hilariously titled The Big Tease, starring \u00d1 for those with even longer memories \u00d1 Craig Ferguson, onetime egregious stand-up Bing Hitler and latterly the latest in the long line of fine British comic talent to make it large across the pond (Tracey Ullman). Plot-wise, Ferguson appears as an effete Scottish hairdresser (!) adrift in LA after arriving for the prestigious Platinum Scissors award (nice one Sacha), there\u00d5s a cameo from David Hasselhoff and, hmmm, that\u00d5s about it. So far, so harmless. The only thing which rankles about The Big Tease is its implicit self-satisfaction in being about, oh, you know. In the trailer, for example, you\u00d5ll find Ferguson delivering a monologue wherein \u00d1 after an amusing hairdressing-related pastiche of Taxi Driver \u00d1 he tacitly points out what a brilliantly novel concept our man Sacha has come up with: \"There have been many great hairdressing movies in Hollywood history,\" he mugs, \"like Shampoo\u00c9\" At which point Bing (as was) trails off, at a loss, his silence designed to illustrate the yawning cinematic void he, Sacha Gervasi and David Hasselhoff are ready to fill (sorry, I\u00d5m probably not doing it justice \u00d1 it\u00d5s really very funny). Sadly, however, Ferguson\u00d5s spiel ignores three salient facts, the first being that, in the shape of Summer Of Sam and Stigmata, there are two films already on release involving hairdresser heroes/heroines. The second, meanwhile, is that even if there were only a single similar opus in the Tinseltown archives, that\u00d5s no reason for a follow-up (there\u00d5s only ever been one press-magnate-and-sledge flick, but that doesn\u00d5t mean we need another with a camp Glaswegian press magnate and his camp Glaswegian sledge). And the third? The third is that Shampoo is too good to be mentioned in the same breath as The Big Tease. Because, when people talk about the golden age of 70s film-making, this \u00d1 as much as Altman, Cassavetes et al\u00d1 is what they\u00d5re on about. Not only does it provide Warren Beatty with the definitive Beatty role, it also gives us the definitive celluloid coiffeur. In Beatty\u00d5s cosmically narcissistic, sex- and self-obsessed goon George Roundy, we\u00d5re not just watching an actor inadvertently cementing his own public image; we\u00d5re witnessing one of those rare occasions when cinema tramples into reality. Coming at a time when a man cutting a woman\u00d5s hair was still regarded as a new-fangled totem of permissiveness, temperamental walking dildo George became frozen in the popular imagination as everything any self-respecting hairdresser should be (well, at least the straight ones). Plus, over and above the film theory Nadsat, Shampoo\u00d5s also a lot of fun. Addled on styling gel, pheromones and the honeyed words of the LA society ladies he toys with over the heated tongs, Beatty gads about between Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn and a pre-coke Carrie Fisher, brutally orders his clientele to submit to his grand artistic vision, and boldly confronts the squares who just don\u00d5t, you know, understand. \"I got the heads!\" he screams at his hapless bank manager during one particularly tense moment, \"I got a lot of heads!\" There: better than The Big Tease already. Positioning the movie hairdresser as part crimper-toting gigolo, part priest substitute, Shampoo later found itself echoed \u00d1 however tangentially \u00d1 in Edward Scissorhands, this time with Johnny Depp lined up as the shoulder to cry on/lech over by the film\u00d5s female personnel. Ecstatic in the knowledge that, while he may have been a deformed mute, he wasn\u00d5t demonstrably gay, you may remember the womenfolk of suburbia swooning orgasmically over Edward\u00d5s every avant-garde prune and shear; until, of course, they hounded him out of town like the mutant freak he was. None of which would have ever happened had he been a barber; after all, in life as on screen, a barber is very different proposition to a hairdresser! Hairdressers pout, barbers glower; hairdressers smooth-talk, barbers sweat down the back of your neck; hairdressers conceptualise, barbers give you exactly the same misshapen flat-top they just gave the fat 10-year-old in front of you.

      "body": "<p>In the lush surroundings of Jimmy's night club, the party to mark the LA premiere of Neil Jordan's new movie The End Of The Affair is getting under way. By the lamentably low standards of such movie industry junkets, it's a fairly lively affair. </p> <p>The small but vocal Irish contingent seems to have injected into the frantic jocularity of the liggers and the mid-level execs an air of genuine good cheer. Even the celebrities, who normally evaporate after 25 minutes, are still nattering away contentedly: a radiant Julianne Moore is talking babies with Jordan's partner Brenda, Ralph Fiennes is expounding on a horseback trek he plans to take across Mongolia, and Brad Pitt, who worked with Jordan on Interview With The Vampire and is here with his burly minder out of solidarity, chats up the director's daughter Anna, 20, who looks uncannily like her father, but with kohl and piercings. </p> <p>Only Jordan himself remains resolutely detached, flitting morosely around the room or sitting uneasily in some corner, drumming with his fingertips on the table, staring passionately into the middle distance. Occasionally, he's playful and endearing, such as when he captures Brad Pitt with an awkward bear-hug and yells an abrupt: \"How are ya, Brad?\" But equally, his manner is quite unnerving when he collides with a journalist by the bar, and the conversation instantly breaks down into stunted exclamations, laced with Jordan's characteristic \"hmmmms\" and \"you knows\". </p> <p>In contrast, the company of his loquacious pony-tailed producer, Stephen Woolley, is easeful: \"I just don't think that Neil has quite mastered the art of polite conversation,\" he says. \"He finds it really difficult to talk about the weather, and all that usual stuff. Most things are completely peripheral to his vision.\" </p> <p>Of all the characteristics and influences that come together in Neil Jordan, it is this enigmatic reserve that is perhaps the most dominant and intriguing. \"He knows very well how to work that to his benefit,\" says Hugh Linehan, a film critic for the Irish Times who has worked on Jordan films. \"He will give you that blank look intentionally, to try to make you feel awkward. I have seen him do that on the set. He uses it to force people to come up with things.\" It seems particularly effective with actors, who find in Jordan's careful reticence a delicate and unimposing guiding hand: \"He hasn't got a fixed idea of what he wants,\" says Ralph Fiennes, who plays Bendrix in The End Of The Affair, \"he's open to the journey of performance, and his manner is very easy. He's never in the least imposing. I just think that he's very collaborative, very open.\" </p> <p>Even more vital for a filmmaker in search of funding, producers view Jordan's lack of frills as unalloyed dedication: \"He is a person of talent and passion,\" says David Geffen, producer of Interview With The Vampire and Michael Collins. \"He understands how to solve problems. He is not temperamental or difficult to work with.\" </p> <p>It might even be said that in Jordan's work, in the career choices he has made and the dogged determination he has shown, and even the material he has produced, there is also the mark of his restive persona and its attendant curiosity. Though a pioneer of Irish film, he has maintained a distance from the nascent Irish Film Industry that has now sprung up around him. He has opted to make films with a visual daring unknown among his fellow Irish directors and of an almost startling diversity, from big Hollywood blockbusters - such as Interview With The Vampire, to highly intimate pieces - The Miracle, to his current adaptation of The End Of The Affair, by the quintessentially English novelist Graham Greene. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't demean Neil even by saying that he is the first international Irish filmmaker,\" says the critic Alexander Walker. \"He is simply an international filmmaker who has his preferred subjects and areas of interest dealing with the Irish character.\" </p> <p>Practically all of Jordan's films, even some of the more conventional genre pictures, have a brooding, off-kilter, unclassifiable quality, or as his friend, the novelist John Banville, puts it: \"the great thing about Neil's movies is that they are all slightly sick.\" As is probably fitting for a director whose first ever sex scene - in Angel - involved a saxophonist and an underage deaf mute, Jordan's films make constant forays into lonely sexual byways. In The Miracle, he gave us jittery Oedipal yearning; in Mona Lisa, it was Soho sleaze; and, most famously, in The Crying Game, it was the love affair between a transvestite and an IRA man. </p> <p>There is even something vaguely eerie in the constant repetition of Jordan 's favourite decorative motifs: the jangling tunes of the beach-front marquee and the gaudy ambience of the seaside town. \"I can never end a story until I get it to the sea,\" Jordan claims. </p> <p>Though he identifies himself as \"not particularly political\", and though he feels that there is nothing wrong with the idea of republicanism, his capacity to whip up political controversy with the sheer, and almost naive boldness of his political dramas has remained undiminished. For its depiction of a musician's descent into terrorism, Angel was lambasted by nationalists for \"reinforcing British stereotypes of the Irish as prone to violence\". The Crying Game was attacked for what was considered a favourable portrait of an IRA character, and the biopic Michael Collins, which dealt with the controversial Sinn F\u00e9in leader of the 1920s, was attacked by Nationalists, Unionists and the right-wing English press for historical inaccuracy and for being a piece of \"neo-fascist propaganda\" for the IRA. </p> <p>\"I found a lot of the argument very untruthful,\" Jordan says. \"These were areas we never intended to get into. All we were tying to do was use the language of the gangster movie to tell the story.\" Overall, however, he feels he has achieved what he set out to do with his political films: \"I think they had some impact. Now it's all about change, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Neil Jordan was born on Febru ary 25, 1950, in Rosses Point, County Sligo, the second child of Michael and Angela Jordan. A few years later, the family relocated to Clontarf on the north coast of Dublin Bay, consolidating a fascination with the sea that Jordan continues to indulge both in his life and art. Life in the Jordan household was relatively free, though rather strict. Michael Jordan was an educationist involved in broadening the Irish school curriculum and was writing a thesis on the adverse effects of different kinds of popular children's literature. While he forbade his own children to read comics, he kept a pile in his study as part of his research. </p> <p>He forbade television, and he limited cinema-going to \"once every two weeks, whereas all my friends would go twice a week\", Jordan says. Any artistic stimulation the young boy had was provided in classes run by his mother, an artist, by his father's library, which was crammed with Joyce and Graham Greene, and through playing the guitar. </p> <p>In school, Jordan generally performed badly: \"I was a slow learner,\" he says, \"which was ironic because my father was an educationist. I was a living refutation of all of his theories. The only thing I had any interest in was literature.\" After attending a local primary school in Clontarf, Jordan moved on to St Paul's College in Raheny, a mid-level private school. </p> <p>\"He was a very reserved boy, but in no way a loner; he always mixed with people,\" remembers his English teacher, Father Joseph McCann. \"Though his English compositions were quite conventional for a boy of that age, if you looked at them again it was always possible to see some new angle.\" In his final years, he won the school president's prize for a short story entitled Sunday. </p> <p>At University College, Dublin, Jordan studied medieval literature - his thesis was on the lives of the saints - and English literature, which he didn't enjoy: \"I didn't understand how they thought it possible to dissect a book like a piece of meat. It seemed far too clinical.\" He maintained something of a low profile, and though he was drawn to the college drama society, always remained somewhat apart from the crowd. </p> <p>\"He was a very good-looking guy, with long black hair and sallow skin, and he reminded me of Yeats as a young man,\" remembers filmmaker and journalist Michael Sheridan, who was a contemporary of Jordan's. \"He was a withdrawn, shy type of person who didn't mix very very easily; like the rest of us in college, his social graces were limited. But he had an air of mystery which people recognised and drew them to him.\" </p> <p>During his college years he met Vivienne Shields, a law student who would soon become his wife: \"We just met at the university one evening, as you do,\" Jordan remembers. \"All my friends were getting married, so I thought that I had better do so as well.\" </p> <p>When he left college in 1971, it was almost impossible to get a job: \"With the degree I had, I was basically unemployable. If you go back to 1972-74 in Ireland, there was nothing to do, no jobs to be had.\" And so, at the first opportunity, he headed off with his wife to London, and worked on a series of labouring jobs, writing short stories in his spare time. </p> <p>He returned to Dublin in 1973, for the funeral of his wife's aunt, decided to stay, and picked up occasional jobs as nightwatchman and teacher. While Vivienne found work in law, Jordan minded the kids and wrote. \"I suppose you could say I was a bit of a house-husband,\" he says. \"I couldn't actually find a job. Vivienne was the one who was earning the money.\" </p> <p>Around this time, though, Jordan teamed up with the future film director Jim Sheridan and his brother Peter to put on a number of theatre projects around Dublin. Sheridan remembers they met at a lecture, \"and I think that within three months we were doing a show called Journal Of A Hole, in the Project arts centre.\" Another piece they performed was Oedipus Rex, with Jordan playing Tiresias. \"The reviews were all terrible,\" says Sheridan, \"but Neil was quite brilliant as Tiresias. All he had to do was come out and exert his personality rather than act, and at that he was very good, very powerful.\" </p> <p>It was also at this time that Jordan began to rent out his talents as a musician. It would turn out to be a formative experience. He joined a group called Eilis to play saxophone and banjo: \"Neil certainly brought a distinctive flavour to the material,\" remembers Niall Stokes, founder of the band. \"We did stuff that had a vaudeville feel, where the banjo worked well. He wasn't a virtuoso but he was a good player.\" </p> <p>Many of Jordan's experiences with Eilis would form the basis of his first film, Angel, the story of a musician who swaps his saxophone for a gun. \"I once arranged a gig in the lunatic asylum in Portlaoise,\" remembers Stokes. \"While we were doing our sound check, the patients started to filter into the hall, watching us as we tuned up. It was a very strange experience, and one that ended up directly in the film.\" </p> <p>Throughout all of this, Jordan was writing, producing the stories that would eventually be published in 1976 as Night In Tunisia, with the help of a group that he had co-founded, called the Writer's Co-Op. The stories were immersed in the imagery of Jordan's childhood: sad and lonely beachfront vistas, unsuccessful musicians, all shot through with shimmering, subterranean sexuality. </p> <p>The opening story, Last Rites, is particularly bleak and brutal piece about the suicide of a labourer in a public bath. \"Incredibly savage,\" he reflects now, \"It must have just been the way I felt, I suppose, as if I hadn't any prospects. I was working in that place and I was going in to shower there every day. That idea just grew from that.\" The collection picked up the Guardian Fiction Prize, signalling for Jordan a bright literary future. </p> <p>However, at this time he was also being pulled in another direction. He began writing for television and radio, producing some episodes of a dramatised biography of Sean O'Casey, and a couple of TV and radio plays. Jordan attracted the attention of the film-maker John Boorman, who says: \"I became aware of him through the short stories; they had a very cinematic quality. I recognised that he had a vision and a talent.\" As a result, Boorman took the unprecedented step of diverting \u00a325,000 from the budget of his film Excalibur so that Jordan could make a documentary about its making. </p> <p> At the same time, he set about producing a new script for himself to direct, the work that would become Angel, the story of a Northern Irish musician's descent into violence. After showing the script to Boorman, Jordan convinced him to come on board as executive producer. However, Boorman was also chairman of the Irish Film Board, which would provide a chunk of the funding. </p> <p>Though Boorman resigned his position before the decision was made to fund Angel, this apparent conflict was to kick off the first, though not the last, major controversy of Jordan's career. Boycotts were organised and irate meetings held: \"There was one meeting when everyone was blackballing Jordan,\" Michael Sheridan remembers, \"and he is reputed to have left in tears.\" </p> <p>For the lead role, Jordan cast an actor well known in Dublin theatre circles named Stephen Rea, who would become his long-time collaborator. \"He was monosyllabic, and I didn't say anything at all,\" Rea remembers, \"so it would have been difficult for us to know each other very well. It's really only over the years that I could say I knew him, he really was very shy and very difficult to talk to.\" Rea remembers tension on the set of Angel: \"I had a sense that a lot of the crew rather resented that someone so inexperienced was directing a movie.\" </p> <p>When the film was shown at Cannes, to attract video distributors, it became a late-night sensation: \"It wasn't in competition: it was showing in some backstreet cinema at midnight,\" remembers Stephen Woolley. \"I saw it and thought it was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to buy it for my own film company, Palace, which was then still quite small.\" </p> <p>After a battle with Channel 4, which initially didn't want to release Angel for cinema distribution, it ran in Woolley's Scala cinema in London, and became a critical hit which drew modest audiences. But the film did lead to a meeting between Woolley and Jordan that would change both of their lives: \"Neil flew over to London and he stayed with me. I had a copy of his short stories which I had read. We just started talking about stuff, what kind of movies we liked and that was it.\" </p> <p>Jordan showed him the script that would later become The Crying Game, then titled The Soldier's Wife. But since a rather similar film - Cal - had just been released, Channel 4 mooted the idea of adapting Angela Carter's post-feminist short story, The Company Of Wolves. The resulting film turned out to be a hit in the UK, bigger than Ghandi or Splash. </p> <p>Then, in 1986, came the picture that really brought Jordan to public attention for the first time: Mona Lisa. He had hatched the idea after he read a crime report about a prostitute's \"chauffeur\". From a treatment by Jordan, the screen-writer David Leland wrote the first draft of the script, and Jordan produced a second draft. </p> <p>It was sent to Bob Hoskins, who had first attracted Jordan's atten tion in The Long Good Friday, but he initially turned down the central role. Then late one night, Hoskins recalls, he got a knock on the door and opened it to find a bedraggled Irishman enquiring rather brusquely: \"Why don't you want to do my script, what's wrong with it?\" Hoskins tried to explain that the central character was simply too violent, no more than a pimp, and that if Jordan came up with a second draft, then he might reconsider. Jordan went off to produce the rewrites, and Hoskins took the part. </p> <p>It was after the critical and box-office success of Mona Lisa that Jordan made the first and most major of his wrong turnings. First, he decided to go to Hollywood; and second, he decided to do a comedy. High Spirits was from the offset something of a bad idea: \"Never let me do a comedy again,\" Jordan said after it. The result, a mish-mash starring Steve Gutenberg, Daryl Hannah and Peter O'Toole, was a disaster. </p> <p>The studio moved in at the last minute to re-cut the film, pulling Jordan from his holiday in order to bully him into making the necessary alterations. Immediately afterwards, he turned to We're No Angels, a script that David Mamet had written for himself to direct. Yet again, though not quite of the egregious quality of High Spirits, the film misfired and didn't do well at the box office. </p> <p>After We're No Angels failed, Jordan recoiled from the Hollywood experience to make The Miracle, with his then girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo playing an actress whose son falls in love with her when she returns to Ireland after many years away. Since the breakup of his marriage to Vivienne Shields, he had a number of girlfriends until hooking up with D'Angelo around 1986, in what has been described as a \"tempestuous\" relationship. </p> <p>By the time of The Miracle, complications had arisen in the form an affair Jordan had had with an architect named Mary O'Donaghue, when they produced a child. \"The shoot degenerated into soap opera,\" recalls one observer. \"It all came out in a very public way and it proved very difficult for all involved.\" For D'Angelo, it meant the end of the relationship. \"I can remember that I really couldn't give myself to that role because of events that were going on around me in my personal life,\" she says, refusing to elaborate. Shortly after the split, Jordan got together with his personal assistant Brenda Rawn, his current partner. </p> <p>The Miracle was also a commercial failure, making Jordan's next project, The Crying Game, very difficult for producer Stephen Woolley to sell. Even when funding had been put together from a patchwork of sources, the difficulties were not over: \"I didn't have enough cash, we had started the film and we couldn't pay anyone,\" recalls Woolley. \"I was using the money from my cinema, the Scala, or maxing out my credit cards.\" </p> <p>To add to the complications, Jordan and Woolley were living under the same roof throughout: \"We would just use a cup in the morning when we got up. Neither of us ever washed up. There were hundreds of cups everywhere. We couldn't take our own company, so it was quite intense.\" </p> <p>At first, The Crying Game failed to find a major distributor, and played at a limited number of cinemas in England. Jordan was now seriously talking about giving up filmmaking and going back full time to novels. Then, having refused to contribute to the funding, Miramax suddenly decided to pick up the film's US distribution, and it became the surprise hit of 1992, transforming the way that arthouse pictures were viewed in the industry, and eventually grossing about $70m.

The points that were most objected to were: showing that the British used tanks on the first Bloody Sunday, August 22, 1920; the introduction of a meeting with Eamon De Valera, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, before Collins's assassination in 1922; the cruelly accurate depiction of De Valera by Alan Rickman; and the combining of a number of characters into one. </p> <p>It was these contradictions, however, that Jordan set out to explore: \"One reason why I wanted to make Michael Collins was because he was actually a very contradictory figure - the figure that republicans loathed.

      "bodyText": "In the lush surroundings of Jimmy's night club, the party to mark the LA premiere of Neil Jordan's new movie The End Of The Affair is getting under way. By the lamentably low standards of such movie industry junkets, it's a fairly lively affair. The small but vocal Irish contingent seems to have injected into the frantic jocularity of the liggers and the mid-level execs an air of genuine good cheer. Even the celebrities, who normally evaporate after 25 minutes, are still nattering away contentedly: a radiant Julianne Moore is talking babies with Jordan's partner Brenda, Ralph Fiennes is expounding on a horseback trek he plans to take across Mongolia, and Brad Pitt, who worked with Jordan on Interview With The Vampire and is here with his burly minder out of solidarity, chats up the director's daughter Anna, 20, who looks uncannily like her father, but with kohl and piercings. Only Jordan himself remains resolutely detached, flitting morosely around the room or sitting uneasily in some corner, drumming with his fingertips on the table, staring passionately into the middle distance. Occasionally, he's playful and endearing, such as when he captures Brad Pitt with an awkward bear-hug and yells an abrupt: \"How are ya, Brad?\" But equally, his manner is quite unnerving when he collides with a journalist by the bar, and the conversation instantly breaks down into stunted exclamations, laced with Jordan's characteristic \"hmmmms\" and \"you knows\". In contrast, the company of his loquacious pony-tailed producer, Stephen Woolley, is easeful: \"I just don't think that Neil has quite mastered the art of polite conversation,\" he says. \"He finds it really difficult to talk about the weather, and all that usual stuff. Most things are completely peripheral to his vision.\" Of all the characteristics and influences that come together in Neil Jordan, it is this enigmatic reserve that is perhaps the most dominant and intriguing. \"He knows very well how to work that to his benefit,\" says Hugh Linehan, a film critic for the Irish Times who has worked on Jordan films. \"He will give you that blank look intentionally, to try to make you feel awkward. I have seen him do that on the set. He uses it to force people to come up with things.\" It seems particularly effective with actors, who find in Jordan's careful reticence a delicate and unimposing guiding hand: \"He hasn't got a fixed idea of what he wants,\" says Ralph Fiennes, who plays Bendrix in The End Of The Affair, \"he's open to the journey of performance, and his manner is very easy. He's never in the least imposing. I just think that he's very collaborative, very open.\" Even more vital for a filmmaker in search of funding, producers view Jordan's lack of frills as unalloyed dedication: \"He is a person of talent and passion,\" says David Geffen, producer of Interview With The Vampire and Michael Collins. \"He understands how to solve problems. He is not temperamental or difficult to work with.\" It might even be said that in Jordan's work, in the career choices he has made and the dogged determination he has shown, and even the material he has produced, there is also the mark of his restive persona and its attendant curiosity. Though a pioneer of Irish film, he has maintained a distance from the nascent Irish Film Industry that has now sprung up around him. He has opted to make films with a visual daring unknown among his fellow Irish directors and of an almost startling diversity, from big Hollywood blockbusters - such as Interview With The Vampire, to highly intimate pieces - The Miracle, to his current adaptation of The End Of The Affair, by the quintessentially English novelist Graham Greene. \"I wouldn't demean Neil even by saying that he is the first international Irish filmmaker,\" says the critic Alexander Walker. \"He is simply an international filmmaker who has his preferred subjects and areas of interest dealing with the Irish character.\" Practically all of Jordan's films, even some of the more conventional genre pictures, have a brooding, off-kilter, unclassifiable quality, or as his friend, the novelist John Banville, puts it: \"the great thing about Neil's movies is that they are all slightly sick.\" As is probably fitting for a director whose first ever sex scene - in Angel - involved a saxophonist and an underage deaf mute, Jordan's films make constant forays into lonely sexual byways. In The Miracle, he gave us jittery Oedipal yearning; in Mona Lisa, it was Soho sleaze; and, most famously, in The Crying Game, it was the love affair between a transvestite and an IRA man. There is even something vaguely eerie in the constant repetition of Jordan 's favourite decorative motifs: the jangling tunes of the beach-front marquee and the gaudy ambience of the seaside town. \"I can never end a story until I get it to the sea,\" Jordan claims. Though he identifies himself as \"not particularly political\", and though he feels that there is nothing wrong with the idea of republicanism, his capacity to whip up political controversy with the sheer, and almost naive boldness of his political dramas has remained undiminished. For its depiction of a musician's descent into terrorism, Angel was lambasted by nationalists for \"reinforcing British stereotypes of the Irish as prone to violence\". The Crying Game was attacked for what was considered a favourable portrait of an IRA character, and the biopic Michael Collins, which dealt with the controversial Sinn F\u00e9in leader of the 1920s, was attacked by Nationalists, Unionists and the right-wing English press for historical inaccuracy and for being a piece of \"neo-fascist propaganda\" for the IRA. \"I found a lot of the argument very untruthful,\" Jordan says. \"These were areas we never intended to get into. All we were tying to do was use the language of the gangster movie to tell the story.\" Overall, however, he feels he has achieved what he set out to do with his political films: \"I think they had some impact. Now it's all about change, isn't it?\" Neil Jordan was born on Febru ary 25, 1950, in Rosses Point, County Sligo, the second child of Michael and Angela Jordan. A few years later, the family relocated to Clontarf on the north coast of Dublin Bay, consolidating a fascination with the sea that Jordan continues to indulge both in his life and art. Life in the Jordan household was relatively free, though rather strict. Michael Jordan was an educationist involved in broadening the Irish school curriculum and was writing a thesis on the adverse effects of different kinds of popular children's literature. While he forbade his own children to read comics, he kept a pile in his study as part of his research. He forbade television, and he limited cinema-going to \"once every two weeks, whereas all my friends would go twice a week\", Jordan says. Any artistic stimulation the young boy had was provided in classes run by his mother, an artist, by his father's library, which was crammed with Joyce and Graham Greene, and through playing the guitar. In school, Jordan generally performed badly: \"I was a slow learner,\" he says, \"which was ironic because my father was an educationist. I was a living refutation of all of his theories. The only thing I had any interest in was literature.\" After attending a local primary school in Clontarf, Jordan moved on to St Paul's College in Raheny, a mid-level private school. \"He was a very reserved boy, but in no way a loner; he always mixed with people,\" remembers his English teacher, Father Joseph McCann. \"Though his English compositions were quite conventional for a boy of that age, if you looked at them again it was always possible to see some new angle.\" In his final years, he won the school president's prize for a short story entitled Sunday. At University College, Dublin, Jordan studied medieval literature - his thesis was on the lives of the saints - and English literature, which he didn't enjoy: \"I didn't understand how they thought it possible to dissect a book like a piece of meat. It seemed far too clinical.\" He maintained something of a low profile, and though he was drawn to the college drama society, always remained somewhat apart from the crowd. \"He was a very good-looking guy, with long black hair and sallow skin, and he reminded me of Yeats as a young man,\" remembers filmmaker and journalist Michael Sheridan, who was a contemporary of Jordan's. \"He was a withdrawn, shy type of person who didn't mix very very easily; like the rest of us in college, his social graces were limited. But he had an air of mystery which people recognised and drew them to him.\" During his college years he met Vivienne Shields, a law student who would soon become his wife: \"We just met at the university one evening, as you do,\" Jordan remembers. \"All my friends were getting married, so I thought that I had better do so as well.\" When he left college in 1971, it was almost impossible to get a job: \"With the degree I had, I was basically unemployable. If you go back to 1972-74 in Ireland, there was nothing to do, no jobs to be had.\" And so, at the first opportunity, he headed off with his wife to London, and worked on a series of labouring jobs, writing short stories in his spare time. He returned to Dublin in 1973, for the funeral of his wife's aunt, decided to stay, and picked up occasional jobs as nightwatchman and teacher. While Vivienne found work in law, Jordan minded the kids and wrote. \"I suppose you could say I was a bit of a house-husband,\" he says. \"I couldn't actually find a job. Vivienne was the one who was earning the money.\" Around this time, though, Jordan teamed up with the future film director Jim Sheridan and his brother Peter to put on a number of theatre projects around Dublin. Sheridan remembers they met at a lecture, \"and I think that within three months we were doing a show called Journal Of A Hole, in the Project arts centre.\" Another piece they performed was Oedipus Rex, with Jordan playing Tiresias. \"The reviews were all terrible,\" says Sheridan, \"but Neil was quite brilliant as Tiresias. All he had to do was come out and exert his personality rather than act, and at that he was very good, very powerful.\" It was also at this time that Jordan began to rent out his talents as a musician. It would turn out to be a formative experience. He joined a group called Eilis to play saxophone and banjo: \"Neil certainly brought a distinctive flavour to the material,\" remembers Niall Stokes, founder of the band. \"We did stuff that had a vaudeville feel, where the banjo worked well. He wasn't a virtuoso but he was a good player.\" Many of Jordan's experiences with Eilis would form the basis of his first film, Angel, the story of a musician who swaps his saxophone for a gun. \"I once arranged a gig in the lunatic asylum in Portlaoise,\" remembers Stokes. \"While we were doing our sound check, the patients started to filter into the hall, watching us as we tuned up. It was a very strange experience, and one that ended up directly in the film.\" Throughout all of this, Jordan was writing, producing the stories that would eventually be published in 1976 as Night In Tunisia, with the help of a group that he had co-founded, called the Writer's Co-Op. The stories were immersed in the imagery of Jordan's childhood: sad and lonely beachfront vistas, unsuccessful musicians, all shot through with shimmering, subterranean sexuality. The opening story, Last Rites, is particularly bleak and brutal piece about the suicide of a labourer in a public bath. \"Incredibly savage,\" he reflects now, \"It must have just been the way I felt, I suppose, as if I hadn't any prospects. I was working in that place and I was going in to shower there every day. That idea just grew from that.\" The collection picked up the Guardian Fiction Prize, signalling for Jordan a bright literary future. However, at this time he was also being pulled in another direction. He began writing for television and radio, producing some episodes of a dramatised biography of Sean O'Casey, and a couple of TV and radio plays. Jordan attracted the attention of the film-maker John Boorman, who says: \"I became aware of him through the short stories; they had a very cinematic quality. I recognised that he had a vision and a talent.\" As a result, Boorman took the unprecedented step of diverting \u00a325,000 from the budget of his film Excalibur so that Jordan could make a documentary about its making. At the same time, he set about producing a new script for himself to direct, the work that would become Angel, the story of a Northern Irish musician's descent into violence. After showing the script to Boorman, Jordan convinced him to come on board as executive producer. However, Boorman was also chairman of the Irish Film Board, which would provide a chunk of the funding. Though Boorman resigned his position before the decision was made to fund Angel, this apparent conflict was to kick off the first, though not the last, major controversy of Jordan's career. Boycotts were organised and irate meetings held: \"There was one meeting when everyone was blackballing Jordan,\" Michael Sheridan remembers, \"and he is reputed to have left in tears.\" For the lead role, Jordan cast an actor well known in Dublin theatre circles named Stephen Rea, who would become his long-time collaborator. \"He was monosyllabic, and I didn't say anything at all,\" Rea remembers, \"so it would have been difficult for us to know each other very well. It's really only over the years that I could say I knew him, he really was very shy and very difficult to talk to.\" Rea remembers tension on the set of Angel: \"I had a sense that a lot of the crew rather resented that someone so inexperienced was directing a movie.\" When the film was shown at Cannes, to attract video distributors, it became a late-night sensation: \"It wasn't in competition: it was showing in some backstreet cinema at midnight,\" remembers Stephen Woolley. \"I saw it and thought it was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to buy it for my own film company, Palace, which was then still quite small.\" After a battle with Channel 4, which initially didn't want to release Angel for cinema distribution, it ran in Woolley's Scala cinema in London, and became a critical hit which drew modest audiences. But the film did lead to a meeting between Woolley and Jordan that would change both of their lives: \"Neil flew over to London and he stayed with me. I had a copy of his short stories which I had read. We just started talking about stuff, what kind of movies we liked and that was it.\" Jordan showed him the script that would later become The Crying Game, then titled The Soldier's Wife. But since a rather similar film - Cal - had just been released, Channel 4 mooted the idea of adapting Angela Carter's post-feminist short story, The Company Of Wolves. The resulting film turned out to be a hit in the UK, bigger than Ghandi or Splash. Then, in 1986, came the picture that really brought Jordan to public attention for the first time: Mona Lisa. He had hatched the idea after he read a crime report about a prostitute's \"chauffeur\". From a treatment by Jordan, the screen-writer David Leland wrote the first draft of the script, and Jordan produced a second draft. It was sent to Bob Hoskins, who had first attracted Jordan's atten tion in The Long Good Friday, but he initially turned down the central role. Then late one night, Hoskins recalls, he got a knock on the door and opened it to find a bedraggled Irishman enquiring rather brusquely: \"Why don't you want to do my script, what's wrong with it?\" Hoskins tried to explain that the central character was simply too violent, no more than a pimp, and that if Jordan came up with a second draft, then he might reconsider. Jordan went off to produce the rewrites, and Hoskins took the part. It was after the critical and box-office success of Mona Lisa that Jordan made the first and most major of his wrong turnings. First, he decided to go to Hollywood; and second, he decided to do a comedy. High Spirits was from the offset something of a bad idea: \"Never let me do a comedy again,\" Jordan said after it. The result, a mish-mash starring Steve Gutenberg, Daryl Hannah and Peter O'Toole, was a disaster. The studio moved in at the last minute to re-cut the film, pulling Jordan from his holiday in order to bully him into making the necessary alterations. Immediately afterwards, he turned to We're No Angels, a script that David Mamet had written for himself to direct. Yet again, though not quite of the egregious quality of High Spirits, the film misfired and didn't do well at the box office. After We're No Angels failed, Jordan recoiled from the Hollywood experience to make The Miracle, with his then girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo playing an actress whose son falls in love with her when she returns to Ireland after many years away. Since the breakup of his marriage to Vivienne Shields, he had a number of girlfriends until hooking up with D'Angelo around 1986, in what has been described as a \"tempestuous\" relationship. By the time of The Miracle, complications had arisen in the form an affair Jordan had had with an architect named Mary O'Donaghue, when they produced a child. \"The shoot degenerated into soap opera,\" recalls one observer. \"It all came out in a very public way and it proved very difficult for all involved.\" For D'Angelo, it meant the end of the relationship. \"I can remember that I really couldn't give myself to that role because of events that were going on around me in my personal life,\" she says, refusing to elaborate. Shortly after the split, Jordan got together with his personal assistant Brenda Rawn, his current partner. The Miracle was also a commercial failure, making Jordan's next project, The Crying Game, very difficult for producer Stephen Woolley to sell. Even when funding had been put together from a patchwork of sources, the difficulties were not over: \"I didn't have enough cash, we had started the film and we couldn't pay anyone,\" recalls Woolley. \"I was using the money from my cinema, the Scala, or maxing out my credit cards.\" To add to the complications, Jordan and Woolley were living under the same roof throughout: \"We would just use a cup in the morning when we got up. Neither of us ever washed up. There were hundreds of cups everywhere. We couldn't take our own company, so it was quite intense.\" At first, The Crying Game failed to find a major distributor, and played at a limited number of cinemas in England. Jordan was now seriously talking about giving up filmmaking and going back full time to novels. Then, having refused to contribute to the funding, Miramax suddenly decided to pick up the film's US distribution, and it became the surprise hit of 1992, transforming the way that arthouse pictures were viewed in the industry, and eventually grossing about $70m. It was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay, for which Jordan was famously late picking up the golden statue. \"I was waiting in the bar and suddenly everyone was yelling 'you have got to get up on stage'.\" As an excuse, he told the billions of viewers that he had been in the bathroom. \"He thought that waiting in the bar would seem too Irish,\" explains Rawn, \"but in LA, being in the bathroom had even worse connotations.\" Winning the Oscar began an entirely new phase in Jordan's career. Until then he had been pretty much written off as a major force, but now the offers came flooding in. His first choice was to launch himself into a project that had been brewing since the early 80s: the biopic of Michael Collins. However, even after the success of The Crying Game, no Hollywood studio was willing to risk the necessary multimillion-pound budget for a film about a man who was essentially an Irish terrorist. So, Jordan returned to Hollywood, at the request of David Geffen, to make the $60m Interview With The Vampire, based on the cult novel by Anne Rice. Much to Rice's chagrin, the film was to star Tom Cruise as Lestat, the lead role. Slated by the critics, the film ended up making $250m world-wide. In Hollywood terms it turned Jordan into a big hitter. At the same time, he brought out an elliptical novel called Sunrise With Sea Monster, which dealt with a young man returning from the Spanish civil war, a startling contrast to the overblown gore and indulgence of Interview. For Jordan, though the film may not have been his greatest artistic success, its commercial triumph enabled him to start work on Michael Collins. The script had originally been commissioned by David Puttnam in the early 80s, but it languished as a rival version, which was to star Kevin Costner, constantly threatened to beat it to the screen. However, around 1995, when Costner's project finally collapsed, and the IRA ceasefire made the prospect of doing the film far more palatable, the money finally came through.

He asked to meet me and we met on a Sunday afternoon in 1984. He said he wanted me to play Collins and that it might be a long difficult road.

Going to bed and getting up at regular times is one of the important components of healthy sleep.</p> <p>Among other things, this useful pop-science survey shows what we duvet-lovers have been trying to convince the rest of the hard-eyed, psychotically wakeful world for years: most people really do need more sleep than they get, and are chronically fatigued as a result - indeed, major disasters like the Exxon Valdez spill and Chernobyl can be blamed on sleep deprivation. (This is not the first appearance of such a thesis; it was first widely publicised in Stanley Coren's 1998 The Sleep Thieves.)</p> <p>The rather unfortunately named Dr Dement offers useful self-help tests to determine exactly how much longer you should stay in bed tomorrow, and also gives an overview of the surprisingly young field of sleep science - the physiology of sleep, its relationship with the immune system, and the heated arguments about REM sleep (Dement argues that it's a hangover from the womb, when the developing brain entertains itself in the absence of external stimuli), all in a readable, bedtime-story style. Odd, though, that such a fat book should lack an index. You could fall asleep before finding something specific. Oh, maybe that's the point.</p> <p> <strong> Supercollector: A Critique of Charles Saatchi</strong><br>Rita Hatton and John A Walker<br>Ellipsis, \u00a312<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502329101,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Bracing neo-Marxist screed against the man of whom art critic Matthew Collings has said: \"nobody can ever quite sum up what the problem is\". Our two authors have done it now: the anti-democratic nature of private patronage, by someone moreover who lacks good taste, is strictly a bad thing for the evolution of modern art. Beautifully designed and handily pocket-sized, so you can whip it out to impress attractive strangers at a gallery. </p> <p> <strong> Leonardo: The First Scientist</strong><br>Michael White<br>Little, Brown, \u00a320 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502333498,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> The first scientist - that puts Aristotle, Pythagoras, Roger Bacon, etc, etc, in their place. May as well say he was the first human being.

      "bodyText": "The Promise of Sleep William C Dement and Christopher Vaughan Macmillan, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL Slaving away through the night with goose quill and purple ink, as I do each week to bring you the List (driven only by caffeine, nicotine and a crusading flame of literary duty), actually constitutes terrible \"sleep hygiene\". Going to bed and getting up at regular times is one of the important components of healthy sleep. Among other things, this useful pop-science survey shows what we duvet-lovers have been trying to convince the rest of the hard-eyed, psychotically wakeful world for years: most people really do need more sleep than they get, and are chronically fatigued as a result - indeed, major disasters like the Exxon Valdez spill and Chernobyl can be blamed on sleep deprivation. (This is not the first appearance of such a thesis; it was first widely publicised in Stanley Coren's 1998 The Sleep Thieves.) The rather unfortunately named Dr Dement offers useful self-help tests to determine exactly how much longer you should stay in bed tomorrow, and also gives an overview of the surprisingly young field of sleep science - the physiology of sleep, its relationship with the immune system, and the heated arguments about REM sleep (Dement argues that it's a hangover from the womb, when the developing brain entertains itself in the absence of external stimuli), all in a readable, bedtime-story style. Odd, though, that such a fat book should lack an index. You could fall asleep before finding something specific. Oh, maybe that's the point. Supercollector: A Critique of Charles Saatchi Rita Hatton and John A Walker Ellipsis, \u00a312 Buy it at BOL Bracing neo-Marxist screed against the man of whom art critic Matthew Collings has said: \"nobody can ever quite sum up what the problem is\". Our two authors have done it now: the anti-democratic nature of private patronage, by someone moreover who lacks good taste, is strictly a bad thing for the evolution of modern art. Beautifully designed and handily pocket-sized, so you can whip it out to impress attractive strangers at a gallery. Leonardo: The First Scientist Michael White Little, Brown, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL The first scientist - that puts Aristotle, Pythagoras, Roger Bacon, etc, etc, in their place. May as well say he was the first human being. You have to admire White's phenomenal work-rate, but you certainly don't have to admire a claim like this: \"I show how his thoughts were literally sealed off from society and tragically wasted\".

Physicists have a fair claim to be the best at actually doing it, at least if the search is for structure rather than meaning. But how far can they go? </p> <p>Murray Gell-Mann was well placed to go as far as humanly possible. A boy genius, he came of age when post-war America was showering physicists with dollars in gratitude for building the bomb. By his late 20s, he was a full professor at CalTech, with a handsome salary and all the time in the world. And there was plenty for a gifted theoretician like Gell-Mann to ponder. Government largesse extended to building larger and larger machines to smash together the sub-atomic particles which seemed to hold the secrets of creation. The result? A veritable zoo of new particles: pions, mesons, kaons, X-particles. But no one knew how they all fitted together. </p> <p>After Newton, Einstein and the quantum theory, theoreticians knew they must hunt for some pattern in this apparent chaos. In the mid-50s, Gell-Mann was recognised as a powerful talent at the mind-stretching work of spotting a bit of mathematics in reality, or maybe a bit of reality in mathematics. But would it be enough? The boy who grew up knowing all the right answers about everything had a few problems. He was working on questions to which no one knew the right answers. He was in a highly competitive intellectual game in which all the other players had been the smartest kid on the block, too. And he hated being wrong. </p> <p>George Johnson, a fine science writer here trying his hand at biography, does a great job of showing how Gell-Mann's eventual success left him the most celebrated, but also least well-liked, physicist of his generation.</p> <p>He made not just one but three startling proposals. The last of these, the existence of the new elementary particles he dubbed quarks, became the basis of the \"standard model\" of fundamental forces and particles, on which all subsequent physics is built. Yet each of Gell-Mann's ideas was also proposed independently by other scientists, and Gell-Mann's treatment of his colleagues' achievements ranged from grudging acknowledgement to outright denial.</p> <p>This, combined with exasperating compulsions like showing off his linguistic skills by correcting new acquaintances' pronunciation of their own names, endeared him to few. Co-workers who had seen his mind at work at close quarters were often lost in admiration. Others saw someone undeniably impressive, but far from admirable. </p> <p>This is conventional biographical spice. Johnson's best trick, though, is re-creating the sheer confusion of particle physics from the late 40s to the early 60s. He has to do this so you appreciate the magnitude of the theorists' achievement. But he has to do it without utterly confusing the reader. Competing proposals for fitting together particles, forces and fields - or maybe doing without fields altogether - come thick and fast, but the final quark model seems almost as satisfying as it must have done to Gell-Mann.</p> <p>Even then, he hedged his bets. At first, his new scheme - which assumed that triplets of a new kind of particle were hidden inside each of the observable particles - was just a mathematical convenience. When everyone else came to believe that quarks really existed, Gell-Mann said he knew it all along. Never mind, he got his Nobel anyway.</p> <p>And now physics would make no sense without the terms his scheme employs - six kinds of quark, each with its antiquark, and interacting through exchange of force-carrying particles called gluons. The whole lot are governed by a set of rules called quantum chromodynamics. It does not sound that simple, but it lends a structure and symmetry to the particle zoo which no one saw before. The way it emerged from the pre-existing mathematics of group theory is one of the great triumphs of the belief that maths helps to describe the physical world. Johnson's book shows why. </p> <p>Hedging bets and exploiting maths to the max are also the themes of Thomas Bass's engaging look at another bunch of physicists. Like Gell-Mann in recent years, they are most interested in complex systems, the kind which are the focus of attention at the Santa Fe Institute which he helped to found in the 80s.

      "bodyText": "Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics George Johnson Jonathan Cape, \u00a318.99, 434pp The Predictors: How a Band of Maverick Physicists Set Out to Beat Wall Street Thomas A Bass Allen Lane, \u00a318.99, 309pp Buy it at BOL Many have dreamt of finding the hidden order at the heart of things. Physicists have a fair claim to be the best at actually doing it, at least if the search is for structure rather than meaning. But how far can they go? Murray Gell-Mann was well placed to go as far as humanly possible. A boy genius, he came of age when post-war America was showering physicists with dollars in gratitude for building the bomb. By his late 20s, he was a full professor at CalTech, with a handsome salary and all the time in the world. And there was plenty for a gifted theoretician like Gell-Mann to ponder. Government largesse extended to building larger and larger machines to smash together the sub-atomic particles which seemed to hold the secrets of creation. The result? A veritable zoo of new particles: pions, mesons, kaons, X-particles. But no one knew how they all fitted together. After Newton, Einstein and the quantum theory, theoreticians knew they must hunt for some pattern in this apparent chaos. In the mid-50s, Gell-Mann was recognised as a powerful talent at the mind-stretching work of spotting a bit of mathematics in reality, or maybe a bit of reality in mathematics. But would it be enough? The boy who grew up knowing all the right answers about everything had a few problems. He was working on questions to which no one knew the right answers. He was in a highly competitive intellectual game in which all the other players had been the smartest kid on the block, too. And he hated being wrong. George Johnson, a fine science writer here trying his hand at biography, does a great job of showing how Gell-Mann's eventual success left him the most celebrated, but also least well-liked, physicist of his generation. He made not just one but three startling proposals. The last of these, the existence of the new elementary particles he dubbed quarks, became the basis of the \"standard model\" of fundamental forces and particles, on which all subsequent physics is built. Yet each of Gell-Mann's ideas was also proposed independently by other scientists, and Gell-Mann's treatment of his colleagues' achievements ranged from grudging acknowledgement to outright denial. This, combined with exasperating compulsions like showing off his linguistic skills by correcting new acquaintances' pronunciation of their own names, endeared him to few. Co-workers who had seen his mind at work at close quarters were often lost in admiration. Others saw someone undeniably impressive, but far from admirable. This is conventional biographical spice. Johnson's best trick, though, is re-creating the sheer confusion of particle physics from the late 40s to the early 60s. He has to do this so you appreciate the magnitude of the theorists' achievement. But he has to do it without utterly confusing the reader. Competing proposals for fitting together particles, forces and fields - or maybe doing without fields altogether - come thick and fast, but the final quark model seems almost as satisfying as it must have done to Gell-Mann. Even then, he hedged his bets. At first, his new scheme - which assumed that triplets of a new kind of particle were hidden inside each of the observable particles - was just a mathematical convenience. When everyone else came to believe that quarks really existed, Gell-Mann said he knew it all along. Never mind, he got his Nobel anyway. And now physics would make no sense without the terms his scheme employs - six kinds of quark, each with its antiquark, and interacting through exchange of force-carrying particles called gluons. The whole lot are governed by a set of rules called quantum chromodynamics. It does not sound that simple, but it lends a structure and symmetry to the particle zoo which no one saw before. The way it emerged from the pre-existing mathematics of group theory is one of the great triumphs of the belief that maths helps to describe the physical world. Johnson's book shows why. Hedging bets and exploiting maths to the max are also the themes of Thomas Bass's engaging look at another bunch of physicists. Like Gell-Mann in recent years, they are most interested in complex systems, the kind which are the focus of attention at the Santa Fe Institute which he helped to found in the 80s. But Bass's heroes, Norman Packard and Doyne Farmer, don't actually work at the Institute. They are leaders of a new field, \"phynance\", the meeting of physics and finance. Their goals are not to fathom the secrets of the universe but to model the global flows of currency exchanges, stock trades, or commodity futures. Times have moved on.

The inscriptions on the specimen jars which lined the room in racks took fire in their minds: what were yesterday mere hieroglyphs from the periodic table became today urgent proof that even here - laboratory life - writing is mystical. The jars glinted under their labels: it had taken fifteen years to collect and collate them. Now the pair were of one mind. Quietly, methodically they removed the labels from each of the thousands of jars. It took all night. At dawn, rows of bare glass winked at their exhausted coupling against the fume cupboard.

      "bodyText": "The Face Daniel McNeill Penguin, \u00a37.99 Is it ever right to judge a book according to the facial comeliness of its author? Of course not, you'll say, how could you even think such a thing? But, in the case of a book about the face, one toys with such ideas; particularly if the author photograph on the back jacket reveals a pixie-ish, bearded face, hidden from above the eyebrows by a hat (why? To hide baldness? To look like a beatnik?), and generally looking more like the kind of doctor who plays in a jazz band than a proper, scholarly author. \"Ayn Rand placed a preposterously beautiful sketch of herself on book jackets,\" says McNeill, and adds later on that \"the portrait of myself on the jacket of this book may not quite be me\"; a footnote tells us that \"it is\". Which is a shame, as he could have had some fun with our expectations. \"Can I infer my spirit from my physiognomy?\" asked Wittgenstein, but I'm afraid I forget the answer, and McNeill doesn't put in the question. Still, it's probable that you won't be able to think of anything else he's missed out. This is a pell-mell, fact-stuffed tour of the face, starting with a biological tour of its constituent parts; the face's first principles. Why do we have a face that looks the way it does?

Anyone musing on the peculiarity of Barker's character-naming will find their answer in the paterfamilias's fondness for Thurber. </p> <p>The rump of the family - Big, their four-foot-nine daddy; an intellectually switched-on 12-year-old girl named Patch, the four-year-old Feely (\"When he grows up he wants to be bulimic. He thinks it's a veterinarian who specialises in livestock\"); and Medve herself - are living in a precarious state of quasi-harmony, inhabiting various wings of the hotel, living off ancient bar snacks and being unfeasibly vile to one another.</p> <p>The last thing they need - particularly Medve, who, along with the problems that her physique presents, dreams that a serial killer is imprisoned inside her head eating cockroaches for protein - is a stranger coming along to disrupt the fragile eco-system of family life. Least of all when he is a bad-skinned, ginger-haired, balaclava-wearing oddball reeking of antiseptic. </p> <p>Barker, it will already be apparent, is attracted to weirdness, and she is wonderfully able to sustain it over the length of a novel, albeit a relatively short, delightfully plotless and artfully baggy one. Any narrative coherence that can be detected derives from the guerrilla warfare between Medve and the stranger, La Roux, which is conducted with all the booby-traps, ambushes, conspiracies and lunatic skulduggery of a Shakespearean comic sub-plot.

Lighten up a little. Weren't you ever sixteen?\"), drenching us in a tidal wave of digressions of Tristram Shandy proportions, alternately cajoling and scolding, veering recklessly between showing off and beseeching. Her voice is witty, infuriating and unbelievable, her account of the summer's unfolding disasters at once gobsmackingly over-the-top and curiously evasive. </p> <p>In short, despite the fact that she is unlike any 16-year-old you're ever likely to meet (unless you're very unlucky), she is also just like all of them: egotistical, insecure, over-confident, under-confident, shy, brash, whiny, demanding. This novel, which cleverly side-steps the traps of earnestness and seriousness, could well be read as a sort of literary tonic for enervation and grumpiness, the latest welcome despatch from Barker's determinedly perverse and ungovernable imagination.</p>",

That, too, is a clich\u00e9, but Clark is a more original writer than her milieu might initially suggest. </p> <p>This febrile tale is at first narrated by a male writer, an aficionado of locomotive seduction, who flirts and then copulates with the woman sitting opposite him on the train to Paris. He, the cynical literary rou\u00e9, is baffled by unaccustomed feelings of helplessness, and when they get off he takes her to a hotel and then out to dinner, where she disappears.

Sex here does not romantically transcend the physical; transcendence must be found in the bloody sinews of the meat or not at all. The bestial humping is muscular and laudably free of mimsy euphemism (though \"my cock springs to attention\" seems hydraulically imprecise). Emotional states, meanwhile, are incarnated in striking images of bodily tissue suffering violence.

Clark's neo-gothic stylisation is signalled by the woman's unrealistic possession of \"hot gold eyes\", and the writer is repeatedly enraged because he cannot \"make her see\" with \"the words that soar around me, screaming from my eyes\". The writer's eye is not constant (he is unfaithful), and the woman lacks a constant I, as her personality grimly unravels. In the last of a series of titillating postmodern caresses, it is the single appearance of an authorial \"I\" that pins down the writer's savagery, in one story not of his own making. </p> <p>Clark's prose teems with inventive imagery, such as a vision of rooks \"like black hangman's hoods [...] shot down with arrows\". Her tonal control can slip, however: that rook image is nearly spoiled by the superfluous characterisation of the rooks as \"insane\", and the reader is elsewhere bombarded with pathetic fallacy: visions of a \"rotting sun\" or trees on a riverbank like \"a thousand sordid hands\". The richly energetic melodrama of Clark's metaphors sometimes dissolves into the meaningless portent of a phrase like \"midnight's fatal pulverisation\". </p> <p>The novel's characterisation is schematically Manichean: the writer is at once psychologically brutal and self-laceratingly conscious of his own brutality; the woman understands her lover perfectly, yet is in thrall to a doomed and senseless love. Clark is certainly a clever writer, and it is a sort of courage to risk absurdity in the search for emotional precision. But the splinters of grim psychological acuity are eventually overwhelmed by a crescendo of grand-guignol angst. </p> <p>This is really a corset-ripping vampire story, with the writer as bloodsucking anti-hero.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Art Of The National Geographic</strong><br>Alice A Carter, foreword by Stephen Jay Gould <br>National Geographic, \u00a325, 240pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502350182,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The National Geographic once achieved the stunning feat of writing about the forthcoming fall of Singapore without actually mentioning what Singapore might fall to. In one year it visited Mussolini's Rome (\"from ruins to radio\"), phoney-war France and the Netherlands and Britain, and managed barely to mention that they were at war with each other. (My favourite memory is of a picture caption that said \"The English countryside has not been overlooked by the Luftwaffe.\") </p> <p>The reason of course was that the US had yet to join the second world war, and the magazine had subscribers in Germany, Japan, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Britain. That was the secret of its success, and of the strange prism through which it viewed the planet. It was really the world's great international geographic magazine, a gift to the planet from a nation on whose behalf almost every tourist hotel in the world now has an en-suite toilet with a paper band round the seat saying \"Sanitised for your convenience\". </p> <p>The cruel thing you could say about the National Geographic was that it presented a world sanitised for your consumption. The kind thing you could say was that it was committed to an America in which people worked hard, played fair and smiled most of the time, and it did the rest of the world the courtesy of assuming the same things happened there too. The warm thing you could say about it was that, like a Capra movie, it inhabited a wonderful world. </p> <p>You see this most sharply in the paintings. In principle, the journal uses photographers, but there were none about when Robert E Lee surrendered to Ulysses S Grant at Appomattox, or when a Roman galley rammed a Carthaginian deck in 260 BC, or in 1934, when a US Army Air Corps balloon burst at 60,000 feet, dropping at a mile a minute. The last two men got out and opened their parachutes at 800 feet and 300 feet.

      "bodyText": "The Art Of The National Geographic Alice A Carter, foreword by Stephen Jay Gould National Geographic, \u00a325, 240pp Buy it at BOL The National Geographic once achieved the stunning feat of writing about the forthcoming fall of Singapore without actually mentioning what Singapore might fall to. In one year it visited Mussolini's Rome (\"from ruins to radio\"), phoney-war France and the Netherlands and Britain, and managed barely to mention that they were at war with each other. (My favourite memory is of a picture caption that said \"The English countryside has not been overlooked by the Luftwaffe.\") The reason of course was that the US had yet to join the second world war, and the magazine had subscribers in Germany, Japan, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Britain. That was the secret of its success, and of the strange prism through which it viewed the planet. It was really the world's great international geographic magazine, a gift to the planet from a nation on whose behalf almost every tourist hotel in the world now has an en-suite toilet with a paper band round the seat saying \"Sanitised for your convenience\". The cruel thing you could say about the National Geographic was that it presented a world sanitised for your consumption. The kind thing you could say was that it was committed to an America in which people worked hard, played fair and smiled most of the time, and it did the rest of the world the courtesy of assuming the same things happened there too. The warm thing you could say about it was that, like a Capra movie, it inhabited a wonderful world. You see this most sharply in the paintings. In principle, the journal uses photographers, but there were none about when Robert E Lee surrendered to Ulysses S Grant at Appomattox, or when a Roman galley rammed a Carthaginian deck in 260 BC, or in 1934, when a US Army Air Corps balloon burst at 60,000 feet, dropping at a mile a minute. The last two men got out and opened their parachutes at 800 feet and 300 feet. In the painting, one of them has to stand on the gondola and kick the other in the stomach to help him scramble out against the pressure of the rushing air. It probably happened like that.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Million Dollar Mermaid</strong><br>Esther Williams and Digby Diehl<br>Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a317.99, 416pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502342805,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> In 1955, Esther Williams had her red, white and blue star dressing-room on MGM's Hollywood lot redecorated to wipe clean the slick of Nivea and Vaseline which had kept her skin unwrinkled and her hair sleek doing her daily work in chlorinated water. She packed her old bathing caps, pinned a welcome note on the door for Grace Kelly and drove out the studio gate. Fade out. Titles.</p> <p>Esther was 33 and had been a MGM money-maker for over a decade, in daft films confected to showcase her strong grace as an Olympic-class swimmer; but she understood that fashions in absurdity change, and did not want to end up dead in the water like Joan Crawford, who was coming apart just down the corridor. </p> <p>That is one vivid little scene from an autobiography that is full of them - few filmable under the pre-1966 Hollywood production code. There's under-16 Esther, raped repeatedly by a boy her parents took into their family as a substitute for their dead hero son, defying him at last when she realises the robustness she has gained in training. There's Esther, 17, in an aquacade show, dodging priapic, trunkless Johnny Weissmuller (the original Tarzan). There's Esther, 18, fending off for a while MGM's offer of a movie career, unfazed by Louis B Mayer's carpet-chomping rages or attempted seductions by executives who didn't come up to her handsome bosom, eventually to graduate from MGM's finishing school in an Andy Hardy film. </p> <p>Now, I don't believe a word of the dialogue in these scenes (either Esther or her ghost has no ear for the speech of the period), but I don't care. They're horribly funny, like films of her era updated by directors from our lewder time.</p> <p>In a sequence which dropped jaws on the book's US publication last year, Esther hopes to find in her lover, the ludicrously macho actor Jeff Chandler (a proto-Richard Gere hunk with white Brillo-pad haircut), a supportive third husband and father for her kids. She is in a sunsuit, cooking chicken cacciatore in his kitchen, when he summons her to his bedroom, posing for her approval in red wig, Gucci shoes, chiffon gown and too much slap. She sees Jeff off with the funny-sad line that he is too big for the polka dots he adores on his every expensive girly garment. It's Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedy, but remade by David Lynch. </p> <p>That makes Esther sound as if she has the self-awareness, the paralyising investment in image now encountered in Vanity Fair interviews with, say, Sharon Stone. Not so. This isn't a movie life in which the star observes herself from far enough away to understand her own signals. In the decade after the second world war, Esther's all-over tan (actually a tinted grease) defined an American freedom for the rest of the word: one look at her white-water smile and everybody understood that the US of A was a rich land where suburban homes had swimming pools, swimming costumes were of new, sagless Lastex and no military debris rusted on beaches. If MGM could spend all that money building a permanent aqua-stage just so Esther could shoot up on fountain jets in flimsy films, the US sure had resources to spare for the Marshall Plan and H-bomb research. </p> <p>But as actually lived, stardom before the old studios broke apart seems for women to have been an early version of the modern corporate life - the bulge of the babies Esther conceived with her second husband had to be hidden under draped seaweed and gardenias, no interrupting the filming schedule; once born they were publicity props while she had to get back in shape for the next idiocy onscreen. </p> <p>Esther was her only asset, and she only had herself to tend that asset. The second husband was a profligate drone who drank, gambled and misinvested what money she banked from a studio skilled at constructively dismissing employees.</p> <p>Her various directors knew far less than she had had to teach herself about dangerous stunts: she only rarely said no and told them who to hire as stand-in and for how much. Otherwise she jumped from helicopters and planes and learned to water-ski when pregnant, just saving herself and baby from being carved up by the propellors of Busby Berkeley's camera craft; she dived from trapezes, almost drowned in an underwater room constructed by a technician not part of her team, and nearly broke her back swan-diving from six storeys up wearing a inflexible metal crown. </p> <p>At least as she relates it, she was far more alone than a Mel Gibson or a Kevin Costner, with their trainer, dietician, accountant, publicist, personal assistant and their stunt teams, let alone doubles. Onscreen she pretended to be a fun gal flippering along with Tom and Jerry or \"swimming pretty\" - meaning high in the water, demanding extreme upper-body strength - as Howard Keel serenaded. Off screen, she never knew how to use her strengths, possibly because she tried to behave in accord with the 1946 ruling that women ceased to be capable the day they were no longer economically needed to weld and rivet for the war effort. Joan Crawford's wide, war-years shoulders had been pads designed by Edith Head; Esther Williams's were muscle, not easily doffed. </p> <p>When the career and the marital life fell apart, she still had the sea - \"a good swimmer owns the water\" is the best line in the book. The scene from Dangerous When Wet that I adored as a small girl had her swimming the Channel, encouraged by her screen lover (the gorgeous but narcissistic Fernando Lamas), who leaps into the surf to scoop her into his arms once she's crossed the finishing line. They were in the icy, choppy Pacific all day shooting it: every time he clutched her she slid through his grasp because she was coated in authentic goosegrease; finally, in the car back to Culver City, he grabbed her hand and kept it on his exceptional erection the whole way. A few years later, she married him and dwindled into a fat wife, faithful but abject, for over 20 years until his death. I'm glad I didn't know the reality when I used to act out the movie sequence, doing a length of the family tin bath in front of the kitchen fire on Friday nights.</p>",

The nudists' upturned heating had warmed the entire building. So with winter approaching, it was time to head for Calcutta. And where better than the Fairlawn hotel?</p> <p>Run by Violet and Ted Smith, the Fairlawn seemed a little bit of an England that never was. Fawlty Towers transported to the poorest city on earth? Sort of. Except that the Smiths and their guests begin where situation comedy leaves off, and Calcutta itself, while undeniably poor, has a lot more going for it than all those documentaries about Mother Theresa would have us believe. It is a living kaleidoscope - an ever-shifting pattern of buildings and people.</p> <p><strong>Take the Kids Travelling</strong></p> <p>Helen Truszkowski </p> <p>Cadogan, \u00a314.99</p> <p>Friends warned the author of the previous book against taking baby Llewelyn to Calcutta. And when he developed a fever after a few days, they wished they had listened. Would the family have left Bath had they read this book?</p> <p>Its determination to cover all eventualities (\"Children can make themselves big and thus more visible by lying on the ground in a star shape if a searching helicopter flies over\") could deter the faint-hearted. </p> <p>On balance, though, Truszkowski's message is summed up by her subtitle, \"Survive and enjoy\". How do you tell if a prospective hotel is as child-friendly as the brochure claims? How can you be sure you are really getting a discount? Truszkowski has the answers. Her tips for single parents are especially useful. How many have been sent home because they lack written authorisation for the trip from their child's other parent? Star shapes won't save you then, junior. </p> <p><strong>Agatha Christie's England</strong><br>Judith Hurdle<br>RDR Books, \u00a313.99</p> <p>\"I prefer to travel like a local rather than like a tourist on holiday,\" writes Judith Hurdle, \"and I have met such interesting people on public transportation.\" It takes neither a Poirot nor a Marple to work out that the locals are our good selves, Hurdle being an English teacher from Valparaiso, Indiana. </p> <p>Actually, the fact that its author is American works in this book's favour. For it means that Christie fans, while following in the footsteps of their favourite fiction, can also gain innumerable insights into English life that a native might well have overlooked (why, for instance, in order to open the door in an older railway carriage, is it necessary first to open the window?) </p> <p>The action flits between London, Oxfordshire and Devon, with an extraordinary interlude in Harrogate, where Christie turned up after an unexplained 11-day disappearance in 1926. What happened to her? Perhaps nobody told her about opening the train window.</p> <p><strong>Picasso's Paris</strong></p> <p>Ellen Williams </p> <p>The Little Bookroom, \u00a310</p> <p>Any number of books currently work to this formula (see above), and Paris is uncommonly susceptible to such treatment. Indeed, Williams has herself produced a sister title, The Impressionists' Paris, and in this she is not alone. You know the formula. Follow in the artist's footsteps, locate some viewpoints, spot the difference, wring your hands at the ravages of time, then pop into this caf\u00e9 (closed Mondays) for an authentic taste of old Montmartre. But the publishers have certainly gone to town. This is pocket-size, hardback and clothbound, neat and weighty, with illustrations that glint like gemstones. \"Very nice objects,\" as they say. And for once, I'm happy to nod in agreement.</p> <p><strong>Russia from A to Z</strong><br>Vladimir Reznichenko<br>Russian Information Agency Novosti, \u00a37.95</p> <p>A very interesting and comprehensive book on Russia. Says who? Says Boris Yeltsin, that's who. And, as a matter of fact, he's right. </p> <p>It's a veritable mini-encyclopaedia, says Mr Y, presenting \"the life of our country in all its myriad varieties and dynamics\". All of them? \"As it is well known,\" says the chapter on ethnic groups, \"the nationalities question is a sticky one.\" The former president clearly approves of such candour. \"We are not trying to hide contemporary problems,\" he says, \"because we are sure that they will be overcome as soon as the reforms that we have launched are decisively and effectively introduced at all walks of life.\" Quite so.</p> <p><strong>Curious Chester</strong><br>Gordon Emery<br>Gordon Emery, \u00a311.99</p> <p>Perhaps you didn't know that \"Niyon anomhma mh monan oyin\" - it means \"I wash away my sins, not my face alone\" - is the only Greek inscription that is a palindrome (try spelling it backwards after three glasses of ouzo). And perhaps you didn't know that Russian men were expected to pay a beard tax in 1698 - the ones with beards, that is. But you know it now.</p> <p>The Greek palindrome is carved on the oak font canopy at St Peter's church in Chester. Small wonder, then, that it crops up in this \"portrait of an English city over 2,000 years\". But a Russian beard tax? The author was talking about hearth tax and window tax and thought he might as well drop it in. And why not? This is Emery's book - self-published and in his own handwriting. So anything goes. </p> <p>And thanks to good design and a sense of humour, what might have been an undisciplined mishmash turns out to be a very nice book indeed. Dozens of photographs (by Mike Penney) and any number of old prints keep it going at a cracking pace. Like the Chester-Holyhead Mail that overturned in 1827, crushing the brother of the MP for Cheshire...</p> <p><strong>Great Places to Stay in Europe </strong><br>Dorling Kindersley, \u00a314.99</p> <p>You know the look and feel of a DK book. The weight, the shine, the sheer volume of little colour pictures, glittering like jewels and surrounded by crisp, tiny icons on an endless number of pure white pages... You know, also, what a hotel looks like - a parador, a pousada, an inn, an auberge, a farmhouse, a pub, a villa, a cottage, a B&amp;B in a converted windmill... Pour a couple of thousand of these into that DK format and you have this bright little thing to carry around in your briefcase and thumb through when you ought to be working.</p> <p>Working? Oh yes. You'll need to work fairly hard if you want to turn some of these little fantasies into reality (\"charming\" and \"distinctive\" are words that crop up time and again, but I don't see the word \"budget\" too often). Of course, if you're happy just turning the pages and dreaming... Well, dream on. </p> <p><strong>Cheap Sleeps Europe</strong><br>Katie Wood <br>Ebury Press, \u00a312.99</p> <p>The very title has been trimmed to the bone. No pictures and plenty of paper the colour of chipboard, yet it costs a mere \u00a32 less than the plush tome described above. How's this? Well, it does have more than 10,000 entries. And as one reviewer pointed out, it could pay for itself in the first two nights. </p> <p>Some of the addresses mentioned are not a million miles away from red-light districts, Wood points out. \"But we have vetted the places listed, and if there is likely to be trouble or overt displays that your parents wouldn't like, they're not in.\"</p> <p>Overt displays? Somehow, I don't think she's talking about dried flowers on the bedside table.</p>",

It is a living kaleidoscope - an ever-shifting pattern of buildings and people. Take the Kids Travelling Helen Truszkowski Cadogan, \u00a314.99 Friends warned the author of the previous book against taking baby Llewelyn to Calcutta. And when he developed a fever after a few days, they wished they had listened. Would the family have left Bath had they read this book? Its determination to cover all eventualities (\"Children can make themselves big and thus more visible by lying on the ground in a star shape if a searching helicopter flies over\") could deter the faint-hearted. On balance, though, Truszkowski's message is summed up by her subtitle, \"Survive and enjoy\". How do you tell if a prospective hotel is as child-friendly as the brochure claims? How can you be sure you are really getting a discount? Truszkowski has the answers. Her tips for single parents are especially useful. How many have been sent home because they lack written authorisation for the trip from their child's other parent? Star shapes won't save you then, junior. Agatha Christie's England Judith Hurdle RDR Books, \u00a313.99 \"I prefer to travel like a local rather than like a tourist on holiday,\" writes Judith Hurdle, \"and I have met such interesting people on public transportation.\" It takes neither a Poirot nor a Marple to work out that the locals are our good selves, Hurdle being an English teacher from Valparaiso, Indiana. Actually, the fact that its author is American works in this book's favour. For it means that Christie fans, while following in the footsteps of their favourite fiction, can also gain innumerable insights into English life that a native might well have overlooked (why, for instance, in order to open the door in an older railway carriage, is it necessary first to open the window?) The action flits between London, Oxfordshire and Devon, with an extraordinary interlude in Harrogate, where Christie turned up after an unexplained 11-day disappearance in 1926. What happened to her? Perhaps nobody told her about opening the train window. Picasso's Paris Ellen Williams The Little Bookroom, \u00a310 Any number of books currently work to this formula (see above), and Paris is uncommonly susceptible to such treatment. Indeed, Williams has herself produced a sister title, The Impressionists' Paris, and in this she is not alone. You know the formula. Follow in the artist's footsteps, locate some viewpoints, spot the difference, wring your hands at the ravages of time, then pop into this caf\u00e9 (closed Mondays) for an authentic taste of old Montmartre. But the publishers have certainly gone to town. This is pocket-size, hardback and clothbound, neat and weighty, with illustrations that glint like gemstones. \"Very nice objects,\" as they say. And for once, I'm happy to nod in agreement. Russia from A to Z Vladimir Reznichenko Russian Information Agency Novosti, \u00a37.95 A very interesting and comprehensive book on Russia. Says who? Says Boris Yeltsin, that's who. And, as a matter of fact, he's right. It's a veritable mini-encyclopaedia, says Mr Y, presenting \"the life of our country in all its myriad varieties and dynamics\". All of them? \"As it is well known,\" says the chapter on ethnic groups, \"the nationalities question is a sticky one.\" The former president clearly approves of such candour. \"We are not trying to hide contemporary problems,\" he says, \"because we are sure that they will be overcome as soon as the reforms that we have launched are decisively and effectively introduced at all walks of life.\" Quite so. Curious Chester Gordon Emery Gordon Emery, \u00a311.99 Perhaps you didn't know that \"Niyon anomhma mh monan oyin\" - it means \"I wash away my sins, not my face alone\" - is the only Greek inscription that is a palindrome (try spelling it backwards after three glasses of ouzo). And perhaps you didn't know that Russian men were expected to pay a beard tax in 1698 - the ones with beards, that is. But you know it now. The Greek palindrome is carved on the oak font canopy at St Peter's church in Chester. Small wonder, then, that it crops up in this \"portrait of an English city over 2,000 years\". But a Russian beard tax? The author was talking about hearth tax and window tax and thought he might as well drop it in. And why not? This is Emery's book - self-published and in his own handwriting. So anything goes. And thanks to good design and a sense of humour, what might have been an undisciplined mishmash turns out to be a very nice book indeed. Dozens of photographs (by Mike Penney) and any number of old prints keep it going at a cracking pace. Like the Chester-Holyhead Mail that overturned in 1827, crushing the brother of the MP for Cheshire... Great Places to Stay in Europe Dorling Kindersley, \u00a314.99 You know the look and feel of a DK book. The weight, the shine, the sheer volume of little colour pictures, glittering like jewels and surrounded by crisp, tiny icons on an endless number of pure white pages... You know, also, what a hotel looks like - a parador, a pousada, an inn, an auberge, a farmhouse, a pub, a villa, a cottage, a B&amp;B in a converted windmill... Pour a couple of thousand of these into that DK format and you have this bright little thing to carry around in your briefcase and thumb through when you ought to be working. Working? Oh yes. You'll need to work fairly hard if you want to turn some of these little fantasies into reality (\"charming\" and \"distinctive\" are words that crop up time and again, but I don't see the word \"budget\" too often). Of course, if you're happy just turning the pages and dreaming... Well, dream on. Cheap Sleeps Europe Katie Wood Ebury Press, \u00a312.99 The very title has been trimmed to the bone. No pictures and plenty of paper the colour of chipboard, yet it costs a mere \u00a32 less than the plush tome described above. How's this? Well, it does have more than 10,000 entries. And as one reviewer pointed out, it could pay for itself in the first two nights. Some of the addresses mentioned are not a million miles away from red-light districts, Wood points out. \"But we have vetted the places listed, and if there is likely to be trouble or overt displays that your parents wouldn't like, they're not in.\" Overt displays? Somehow, I don't think she's talking about dried flowers on the bedside table.",

Also familiar is the anguish at the loss of loved ones - Vera Brittain on her fianc\u00e9 - and the day-to-day experiences of horror: Enid Bagnold on opera tions without anaesthetics, an extract from a novel by Polish Zofia Nalkowska, about a soldier screaming in agony for hours till he dies, and German exile Jo Miklahy's diary entry on a mysterious humming which turns out to be a bluebottle in a dead soldier's mouth. </p> <p>More radical inclusions, despite the editors' exclusion of macro-politics, are pieces by women in Germany, exposing suspicion about \"spies\", helplessness in the face of official disinformation, and a description of the defence of Liege by women who poured boiling water on German soldiers.

Here we have a story about a painter who gives a culture that has gone numb a new throb of life; one who opens up previously unrepresented areas of feeling with a pictorial approach of revolutionary directness. </p> <p>The main character in this narrative is a stirrer, a bag of trouble, a visual intelligence at odds with a deranged, but infinitely resourceful, big city. In the end, the city wins. This is a story that flatters painting, telling how the world can be changed by brushstrokes; it's also a tale about a killer and how he himself comes to be killed. </p> <p> M (you will gather) is a hopelessly uncool, vulgarian performance by most art-historical lights, and will dismay all those who hope that, by now, the myth of the macho, self- willed genius might have been deconstructed out of court. But it's a great read: it grabs, it kicks, it lives. </p> <p>The hero of this story may, or may not, be the same painter who last year was given a distinguished biographical treatment by the art historian Helen Langdon in her (far better produced) volume Caravaggio . \"Caravaggio\" was the north Italian home town of a painter who was known in the Rome of 1600 by many names: Peter Robb opts to shorten them all to a one-letter cipher. The manoeuvre - which goes with his adoption of a remorselessly punchy, street-talking style - leaves open the possibility that his \"M\" may not be the quantity known to art history at all. His \"working hypothesis\" may be no more than the figment of an imagination reading over-vigorously between the lines of the same 17th-century sources and paintings that Langdon treats with judicious scholarly prudence. </p> <p>But what a driving, resourceful, shrewd imagination is at work here. Robb has gazed long in the galleries and dim-lit churches where the primary evidence for the painter's life remains; has then spread his writing desk with the earliest memoirs of Caravaggio and with a haul of four-century-old Roman police records brought to light by recent scholarship. He shuttles furiously between the images and the transcripts, stitching faces to names, weaving together a whole lost world of loves and hatreds and the jostly, shouty street-life of which Caravaggio's paintings are the still-astonishing trace. </p> <p>The pretty boys mooching around behind the fruit-baskets of the 1590s, with their ripe-to-bursting sensual immediacy, are located among the retinue of Cardinal del Monte, the first patron to recognise the qualities of the young painter from the north. The labourers and toughs and whores who loom out of the dark from the turn of 1600, when Caravaggio's church work makes him the most talked-about painter in Rome, find their seats in the taverns abutting del Monte's palazzo, where drinking companions penned obscene satires on his artistic enemies. And the grim 1606 canvas of a sorrowing David holding the dripping, severed head of Goliath - Caravaggio's own likeness - is made to witness the predicament of a man who has killed an adversary in a street-fight and who will be on the run (through Naples, Malta and Sicily) for his four remaining years of life. </p> <p>The sources Robb brings to bear on a life of run-ins with the law are a gift in one way. They open out a scruffy, smelly Italy jagged with drawn swords, hurled tiles and insults - the pages clang with \"fucking pricks\" and \"dickheads\"; they also give some savour of the intensely difficult, fiercely intelligent man at the heart of the action. But naturally people talking to the police (or writing memoirs of their rivals) are tight-fisted with the important truths; and here Robb, an Australian whose previous book, Midnight in Sicily , tangled with today's Mafia, makes it his business to nose out the conspiracies - including the one that he believes led to Caravaggio's death. </p> <p>It's a strong story, and plausibly told, but the best reason to trust Robb is that he puts his chief trust in the paintings, writing them up with fervour. For their figures still lunge dazzlingly out of the dark of Counter-Reformation Rome, kicking against its oppressive orthodoxies and its slick and chilly art scene. Their hot, palpable, vulnerable flesh continues to stimulate and challenge today as it did in 17th-century Europe. As Robb says, the paintings seem \"to have nothing to do with art at all. They seem to go straight to shocking and delightful life itself.\" </p> <p>Which was Caravaggio's intent: \"He did not take credit for even one brushstroke, but said that it was the work of nature,\" as an early source puts it. Seemingly painted straight onto the canvas without intermediary sketching, his Roman work breaks with Renaissance practices and paradigms to claim the status of photography - received fact, rather than constructed illusion. Robb notes how the pictorial \"window\" of, say, a Raphael gives way to the jut and swell of the paint surface in this new realism; he also traces Caravaggio's connections with the rise of science. Police records note an incident when he was found with a pair of compasses which were assumed to be offensive weapon; Robb takes them rather to be a trace of his connection with the world of Galileo, also working for del Monte, and with his innovative optics. You are put in context so as to feel the force of Caravaggio's cutting edge. </p> <p> Is Robb, then, entirely to be trusted? I don't think so. He may have a fine ear for omerta - for the half-truths of suspects and memoirists - and a keen eye for artistic quality, but it doesn't feel as if he's ever actually held a paintbrush, let alone worked with models. To read him, you'd think that some elderly workman was being paid to lie upside-down with his arms outstretched and his head craning upwards, while his mate knelt down to hoist up the plank beneath him, until Caravaggio had finished painting \"The Crucifixion of St Peter\". More than three minutes of those poses and anyone would be done for - and no one could render things to this canvas's degree of finish that quickly. Caravaggio would have been working up the figures largely from a well-trained imagination, even if it suited his agenda to claim it was all straight from life. Maybe he burned his sketches. Don't trust what painters say, either. </p> <p>Robb accepts that after his flight from Rome, Caravaggio worked mostly from imagination, and he's fascinating about the flashlit, visionary shorthand of the paintings left in obscure Sicilian churches in the fugitive's wake. His own efforts, you might say, amount to a bright flarelight of the imagination, whatever their factual status. One aspect, however, of the resulting book is inexcusable. Whoever decided that eight colour and 16 black-and-white plates would keep the readers happy through a detailed discussion of some 80 paintings short-changed them disgracefully. It amounts to a new suppression of evidence, especially when much of the argument is highly contentious. Bloomsbury should upgrade the format with the next printing.

Although it is tempting to exploit your free time, don't start going fishing mid-week or sleeping late. Get up at your usual hour, shower, eat breakfast and go to \"work\". </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Research first</strong> </p> <p> Comprehensive research is your guide to success. It shows potential employers that you do your homework and keep ahead of the pack. Multiply your opportunities by researching numerous companies within your target industries and geographic region. </p> <p>Analyse a target company's last three annual reports, promotional sales materials, trade publications and any relevant magazine articles to familiarise yourself with the overall industry, your target company's corporate culture and its key executives. Don't overlook the internet - search engines can be very helpful in compiling facts to use during interviews or in crafting CVs. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Determine recruitment patterns </strong> </p> <p> It is also crucial to determine if your target company expects to be downsizing, maintaining a stable workforce or recruiting soon. If, for example, you want to work in marketing find out that specific department's recruiting outlook. It's not uncommon for large companies to recruit in one department while downsizing others. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Use your professional organisation</strong> </p> <p> Professional associations are a great resource for job leads, mentoring and research. They can also keep you in the loop. Contact other professionals to tell them of your goals and to ask for guidance. You never know when one might say: \"Call this person and say I referred you.\" </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Keep knocking</strong> </p> <p> Follow up on a letter of introduction or an initial interview with a timely phone call. Keep it short and to the point. Ask if your letter was received and if any additional information is desired. If necessary, leave your message on their voice mail. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Sell your talents</strong> </p> <p> During your first meeting with an executive, avoid discussing specific positions. Initially, work on bonding with your interviewer by discussing your insights about the company and how your skills complement their corporate strategy. </p> <p>Avoid the \"I will do anything\" trap. It sounds desperate. Instead, state specifically what positions best fit your qualifications. Employers want applicants to possess specific personal qualities, tangible professional credentials and well-articulated career objectives. </p> <p>Be prepared with some penetrating questions. Executives like applicants who know the right questions to ask when problem solving or developing strategy. Ask specific questions regarding current projects, industry trends, employee turnover, ratio of managers to employees, dispute resolution processes, innovations, company reputation, business plans and goals, lines of authority and company expectations. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Respect their time</strong> </p> <p> If you asked for 20 minutes of an executive's time, under all circumstances respect that. Make sure the employer feels in control of the process, including the time involved.

      "bodyText": "Don Cruickshank, the head of the banking review team, has waded into the war over automatic teller machine charging, setting a 30p limit on the cost of withdrawing cash while supporting the principle of the controversial \"surcharge\" favoured by Barclays. His opinions, outlined in a private letter to the Link cash machine network, came just as the banks were starting to feel he was making more conciliatory noises about the outcome of his review into competition in the sector at the behest of the chancellor, Gordon Brown. His comments to Link, which is fighting for survival after a rebellion led by Nationwide Building Society over the Barclays approach, were made in time to influence a crucial vote of members at the end of next month. Mr Cruickshank's intervention coincided with a reminder from the office of fair trading that it was scrutinising the situation closely. John Bridgeman, the director general of the OFT, said: \"It is disagreeable that some banks appear insensitive to the fact that fixed rate charges disproportionately penalise people who are less well-off\". The OFT has yet to start an inquiry while it awaits the outcome of the crucial Link vote in February. If any investigation did find any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour the offenders could face penalties of 10% of their revenues under rules being introduced in March. Mr Cruickshank, who refused to comment yesterday, told Link the owners of ATMs should charge for cash withdrawals, rather than the current account holder. That was interpreted to mean he does not support the \"disloyalty\" fees some banks and building societies charge their customers. It appears to back the route Barclays is trying to pioneer whereby it gives its own customers free access to any Link machine while charging its rivals' customers for using its Barclays-branded machines. The comments also appear to clear the way for independent chains of ATMs to be set up, not necessarily owned by the banks or building societies, as they should be able to cover their running costs by levying the \"surcharge\". However, by setting the limit for charges of between 15p and 30p, Mr Cruickshank poses problems for the banks and building societies, which charge as much as \u00a31.50 in \"disloyalty\" fees. It also appears to make it difficult for Barclays to argue that it should charge \u00a31 - a move fiercely opposed by Nationwide, which would have found it difficult to absorb that charge in such a way that it could continue to offer is customer free access to Link.

      "body": "<p>Mistakes in your CV can damage or even kill your career, because a sub-standard CV can prevent you from ever being called for a job interview. But don't worry - if your CV isn't perfect, you're not alone. Here are the five mistakes that ruin most CVs (and what you can do to prevent them): </p> <p> <strong> Mistake No.1: No objective or summary</strong> </p> <p> By not describing what job or field you want to work in, you start your CV off on the wrong foot. Why? You force the employer to read it all the way through to figure out what kind of job you're suited for. You create more work for your busy reader and this is the last thing you want to do. </p> <p>If you know the exact job title you're applying for, say so! Start the CV something like this: </p> <blockquote> <strong> Summary </strong> <p> Management trainee, where strong people skills, relevant work experience and time spent travelling abroad will add value to operations. </p> </blockquote> <p> What if you don't know the job title? Start your CV like this: </p> <blockquote> <strong> Summary </strong> <p> Seeking a position where strong people skills, relevant work experience and time spent travelling abroad will add value to operations. </p> </blockquote> <p> By starting your CV with a clear objective or a focused summary, you tell the reader exactly what you want to do for him or her. This establishes a rapport and sets the stage for the CV, a simple step which will greatly improve your results. </p> <p> <strong> Mistake No.2: Focusing on you and your needs</strong> </p> <p> This is the worst mistake you can make. Unfortunately, it's also the most common. Remember, no employer wants to recruit you. In fact, employers hate recruiting. They only hire employees when they have problems to solve. </p> <p>And no employer wants to spend a lot of time recruiting you, either, just as you wouldn't want to spend more time in a dentist's chair than you had to. So, your CV must answer quickly the one question that's on every employer's mind: \"What can you do for me?\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, most CVs don't. Too many CVs start out like this: \"Seeking a position where I can utilise my skills in an atmosphere with potential for career advancement.\" </p> <p>This sounds fine and logical to the person writing the CV. But it completely alienates the person reading the CV. </p> <p>Because this person - your potential employer - has his own problems. He couldn't care less about your career aspirations or desire to make more money. </p> <p>Instead, tell the employer how you can add value to his/her operations, or contribute to efficiency. Take another look at our opening summary: </p> <blockquote> <strong> Summary </strong> <p> Seeking a position where strong people skills, relevant work experience and time spent travelling abroad will add value to operations. </p> </blockquote> <p> Now, what employer wouldn't want to talk to someone like you, who's offered to add value to his operations? You could also say: \"...will contribute to operations\" or \"...will add to profitability.\" </p> <p>The exact words don't matter. What does matter is your focus on helping the employer meet his goals. If you do that, your career will advance too. </p> <p> <strong> Mistake No.3: Focus on responsibilities instead of results</strong> </p> <p> While it's important to tell the reader what you've done at each job or work placement you've completed, it's far more important to spend most of your time talking about what you accomplished and how you made yourself valuable to your previous employers. It's easy to do. Just think back on your daily duties. What good things happened when you did your job well? Write them down. </p> <p>Focus on results. The more specific you can be, the better. </p> <p>So, instead of writing \"Responsibilities included implementation of departmental policies and procedures, interfacing with customers and correspondence duties\", it's far better to write this: </p> <blockquote> <p> Worked with customers to help increase sales by 23% in five months. </p> </blockquote> <strong> Mistake No.4: Too many big words</strong> <p> It's a shame how often a good CV is ruined when the author utilises a superabundance of polysyllabic terminology - or uses too many big words. </p> <p>Don't hide behind your vocabulary. When your CV is not clear and to the point, the reader gets bored, time is wasted and your CV goes in the bin. </p> <p>Keep it simple. Write as if you were talking to a class of GCSE students. So, instead of saying \"implemented,\" try \"adopted\" or \"set up,\" for example. </p> <p>Never \"utilise\" what you can simply \"use.\" Don't \"interface\" with people; \"work\" with them. </p> <p>And try not to use \"impact\" as a verb - meteorites hitting the moon are about the only thing that should \"impact\". </p> <p> <strong> Mistake No.5: Spelling/punctuation errors</strong> </p> <p> Your spell-checker is not enough! You should read through your CV once for accuracy (check all the numbers, dates, names, etc.), once for missing or extra words, and once more for spelling. </p> <p>Then, show your CV to several friends and ask them to read it out loud. Listen to where they pause; this could mean you've written something confusing or inaccurate. </p> <p>After you get their feedback, revise the CV so that it's 100% error-free.</p>",

They said that there would be a hostile reaction in Congress, but the Americans can do little because Heathrow is the key. </p> <p>London is still the most popular capital for Americans and talk of moving flights from the US to other airports in Europe, such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt, would probably meet consumer resistance. </p> <p>It is understood that the outline agreement would have allowed two other American carriers, Delta and Continental, landing rights at Heathrow.

It said that it had been campaigning for new competition on routes between Heathrow and the US for two years. Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman, said: \"We are ready, willing and able to bring new competition to these routes. If we could do so, we would create thousands of new jobs and would be able to invest in regional transatlantic services from our developing hub in Manchester.\" Sir Michael said that the transatlantic routes were the largest intercontinental travel markets in the world. But travellers suffered from a lack of competition. \"Business travellers pay far more than their European counterparts, whilst reductions in capacity being introduced by airlines will inevitably lead to increases in leisure fares.\" The German carrier, Lufthansa, has acquired a 20% stake in BM in the hope that the British carrier would gain a footing in the US. It, too, was angry at yesterday's outcome. American government officials were also furious. They said they had come to London thinking they had secured a deal, \"but it blew up in our faces\". They said that there would be a hostile reaction in Congress, but the Americans can do little because Heathrow is the key. London is still the most popular capital for Americans and talk of moving flights from the US to other airports in Europe, such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt, would probably meet consumer resistance. It is understood that the outline agreement would have allowed two other American carriers, Delta and Continental, landing rights at Heathrow. But BA sees that as the thin end of the wedge.",
