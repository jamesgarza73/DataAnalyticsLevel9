Even the e-commerce minister, Patricia Hewitt, was last week reported to have become so fed up with her unreliable email that she has resorted to good old-fashioned paper.

According to communications analyst Richard Metcalf, some offices, far from missing out on the paperless dream, have witnessed an increase in paper as a result of email. \"Email messages now flood computer screens in an avalanche of print.

For those secretaries whose bosses ask them to print out all their messages and leave them in their in-trays, this means using up forests of trees every month.\" </p> <p>Metcalf has found that because emails have a tendency to \"disappear\", PAs are increasingly likely to be asked by clients and colleagues to send documents both by email and fax or snail-mail. \"This highlights a further potential problem of email in the millennial office - eating up time rather than saving it.\" </p> <p>Email has its own rules - many of which make communication easier - but there is also more room for misinterpretation, confusion, deceit and abuse, says psychologist Dr David Lewis. \"Email lacks the clues provided by body language in face-to-face communication and of voice tone in telephone communication. Much less consideration is afforded to emails than to letters or faxes where the sender will most likely print the document and re-read it before putting it in an envelope or on to the fax machine. The nature of the medium means that emails are often hasty, poorly composed and unclear. It's little wonder that misunderstandings are rife. It is something secretarial staff, who often act as the go-between for managers and clients, need to be particularly wary of.\" </p> <p>More worrying still is the fact that more than half the respondents to a Novell survey claim to have received \"flame-mail\" - a derogatory, obscene or inappropriate email message. A quarter said they received them several times a week; half said they got them several times a month. Some even said they had left their jobs to avoid the abuse - and there is little doubt that flame mail is on the increase. </p> <p>Sue Hadwell, 28, a PA from Buckinghamshire, felt she was being publicly humiliated when her manager used to reprimand her by email. \"Why haven't you arranged a lunch for my clients on Tuesday? Are you capable of this or not, Sue? Sometimes I think I could do a better job myself.\" Each message, written entirely in capital letters, had been copied to the company's entire management team. </p> <p>Email is the easiest outlet for workplace frustrations, believes Lewis. \"The aggression displayed in electronic communications can be very overt indeed, both because it is so instant and because there is no chance of interruption. After all, if someone starts hurling abuse at you in the street, or even across an office, you have the chance to interrupt, walk away or even produce a fist. And if you're on the phone, you have the chance to hang up.\" </p> <p>As a result of abusive flame-mails the West Yorkshire police were forced to sack an officer and NatWest Markets to dismiss three employees and to discipline 12 others. Anne-Marie Thompson, an expert in employment law at Eversheds in Birmingham, says, \"We are increasingly approached by companies that discover employees are abusing the email system.\" </p> <p>Even for those who refrain from overt abuse, there may be trouble in store. \"People all too often make the mistake of thinking that the contents of an email, like things said over the phone, are private and not permanent. But it is not only possible for an employer to read all your emails and monitor every internet website you visit, it is also perfectly legal,\" explains Joanna Boag-Thompson, specialist in the internet. </p> <p>Since email messages can be traced back to their origin for a period of at least two years, you might want to re-think emailing colleagues about irritating clients. Asda recently suffered the consequences of an internal email which suggested that a policeman who had made a complaint about some faulty goods was nothing but a fraud. Quite by chance, the policeman heard about the message. He sued Asda and won. </p> <p>It goes without saying that email exists to make life easier and if used correctly is an invaluable tool for businesses of all sizes.

      "bodyText": "There are many famous couples in world drama: Didi and Gogo, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. But I can't think of any pair so inseparably bonded as Tito and Beatrice in Giuseppe Manfridi's Cuckoos. They are permanently stuck in an act of anal intercourse in which there are endless comings and no goings. It sounds spectacularly rude, and as we watch Tito's father, a hearty gynaecologist, turn up with a retractor to extricate his son's instrument, we are not far from the world of Carry On up the Khyber. But, as it progresses over the course of 80 minutes, Manfridi's play turns from sexual farce into domestic tragedy. It becomes a metaphor for a society riddled with hypocrisy - in family-worshipping Italy, Manfridi sets out to destroy the household gods. You see the intention; making it work is another matter. But Colin Teevan's translation neatly combines English puns with Euro-absurdism.

Wroe vividly recreates the everyday background of Pilate's life, down to the minutiae of shaving, and handles her historical material with such humour and skill that we feel able to glimpse the real man behind two millennia of obfuscation and fantasy. The World's Smallest Unicorn Shena Mackay Vintage \u00a36.99, pp223 Buy it at BOL Retirement homes for clowns, failed playwrights in trees, unwashed uncles and families from hell. The manifold horrors of suburbia feature large in Shena Mackay's collection of short stories, which are sometimes as abrupt as a snapshot but so acutely observed that it's impossible not to wince - or laugh - at times in recognition. Mackay gives an absurdist touch to the mundane and everyday, with an occasional foray into the downright surreal (such as the travel writer who ingests Marble Arch in 'The Wilderness Club'), revealing her characters' secrets, passions and flaws with a wit and descriptive flare that's as mercilessly illuminating as a flashbulb going off in a darkened room.",

The file, part of an investigation by the revolutionary government into the 'dark forces' that had supposedly controlled the tsarist regime, contained the original interrogation reports of roughly three dozen individuals - society ladies, clergymen, courtiers, ministers, maids and manservants - who had either met, or been under the spell of, Grigory Efimovich Rasputin, the Siberian 'holy peasant', who had been sensationally murdered three months earlier. </p> <p>In a second thrillerish scene, the successful bidder for the Sotheby's file turned out to be none other than the world-famous Russian cellist, Mstislav Rostropovich, who carried his purchase back to his Paris apartment ('draped with Winter Palace curtains emblazoned with the tsarist coat of arms') and presented it, under the 'inexpressibly sad' gaze of a portrait of Tsar Nicholas II, to his friend, the playwright and historian, Edvard Radzinsky. </p> <p>'It was the File,' writes Radzinsky, breathlessly, 'the one [for which] I had been looking for so long!' Precisely where The File - as he insists on capitalising it - had lain for the previous 78 years, or how it found its way to a London sale-room, or whether it has been authenticated, are questions he does not answer. </p> <p>Radzinsky occupies a curious position in Russian literary life, for which there is no adequate analogy in the West. The author of two highly regarded biographies, of Nicholas II and Stalin, he is also, according to his blurb, 'the most frequently staged playwright after Chekhov' and 'the host of the popular Russian television programme, The Enigmas of History'. It is as if Harold Pinter divided his time between the Public Record Office, the National Theatre and presenting Timewatch. </p> <p>Rasputin: the Last Word exhibits all the strengths and weaknesses one would expect of such a multi-talented hybrid. The first 37 years of Rasputin's life - his birth in a Siberian village, his reputation for thievery and womanising, his religious mania, his wanderings as an impoverished 'holy fool' - are skipped over in barely as many pages. </p> <p>Radzinsky gets into his stride only when he reaches October 1906, when Rasputin, by now transmogrified into the fashionable mystic, 'Father Grigory', manages to worm his way into an audience with the tsar and tsarina. 'He made a remarkably strong impression on Her Majesty and me,' the tsar noted, 'and instead of five minutes, our conversation lasted well over an hour.' </p> <p>From then on, thanks chiefly to his apparent ability to control the heir to the throne's haemophiliac attacks, Rasputin's power and fame grew, until he became a mythic figure. What is the truth about his role? His influence over the autocratic tsarina seems to have been absolute; over the tsar, less so. </p> <p>Rasputin opposed Russia's entry into the war in 1914, but was in Siberia during the crucial period, recovering from an assasination attempt; Radzinsky suggests he might have changed history had he been fully fit, but advances little evidence. He also hints that Rasputin may have had sexual relations with the tsarina, but again has no proof. More than once, reading the tsarina's pleas to the tsar, for example not to take any military decisions until he had brushed his hair with Rasputin's comb, I found myself reminded of nothing so much as the relationship between Ronald and Nancy Reagan and Nancy Reagan's astrologer. </p> <p>What Radzinsky does have that is new and indisputable is The File. Here is a huge amount of colourful, if disjointed, detail from Rasputin's inner circle, who used regularly to congregate at his St Petersburg apartment (No3 English Avenue, telephone number - he would answer it himself - 64646).</p> <p>These previously unpublished eyewitness accounts, collected within months of his death, provide fresh evidence of the nature of his hold over dozens of fashionable St Petersburg ladies. Vera Dzhanumova, the wife of a wealthy merchant, describes how they would gather at teatime to watch his frenzied preaching and dancing, how he 'embraced each one and kissed her on the lips', and how, as they took their leave, 'they whispered to the maid, asking for the father's dirty linen - and with his sweat if possible'. </p> <p>Frequently, of course, it went further than mere laundry collection. Rasputin's close friend, the publisher, Filippov, once saw him literally beating off an admirer, Madame Lokhtina: she 'was holding on to his member, while shouting, \"You are God!\" ' </p> <p>Rumours of his debauchery and drunkenness reached the Russian press, and, inevitably, as the war began to go badly, the German-born tsarina and her sinister-looking 'holy father' were blamed. The rest of the story is familiar (told and retold in at least four biographies published in the past decade). </p> <p>In an attempt to save the monarchy, the decadent bisexual aristocrat, Felix Yusupov, formed a plan to murder Rasputin, luring him to the Yusupov Palace at midnight on 16 December 1916, on the promise that there would be some young ladies present in urgent need of spiritual guidance. Rasputin turned up, the poisoned wine proved too weak, so Rasputin was shot. </p> <p>The conspirators retired upstairs to celebrate and returned to discover Rasputin crawling across the snowy courtyard towards the gate. He was shot again, in the back and head, and his body was driven away and dumped in the river Malaya Nevka. Radzinsky claims the fatal shots were fired not by Yusupov but by Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, and that the facts were covered up. </p> <p>Radzinsky also prints the police photographs of Rasputin's corpse, taken shortly after it was pulled from the water on 19 December. His hands are upraised. 'It was clear,' writes Radzinsky, 'that this powerful man, although still breathing in the car, had concealed the fact, hoping to loosen his fetters in the water. But his human strength had failed him.' </p> <p>Actually, this is not 'clear' at all, and proves, on closer inspection, simply to be another sensational assertion for which Radzinsky offers insufficient evidence. Thus Rasputin: the Last Word ends as it has proceeded: gruesome, dramatic, engrossing and irritatingly tendentious.</p>",

Rasputin's close friend, the publisher, Filippov, once saw him literally beating off an admirer, Madame Lokhtina: she 'was holding on to his member, while shouting, \"You are God!\" ' Rumours of his debauchery and drunkenness reached the Russian press, and, inevitably, as the war began to go badly, the German-born tsarina and her sinister-looking 'holy father' were blamed. The rest of the story is familiar (told and retold in at least four biographies published in the past decade). In an attempt to save the monarchy, the decadent bisexual aristocrat, Felix Yusupov, formed a plan to murder Rasputin, luring him to the Yusupov Palace at midnight on 16 December 1916, on the promise that there would be some young ladies present in urgent need of spiritual guidance. Rasputin turned up, the poisoned wine proved too weak, so Rasputin was shot. The conspirators retired upstairs to celebrate and returned to discover Rasputin crawling across the snowy courtyard towards the gate. He was shot again, in the back and head, and his body was driven away and dumped in the river Malaya Nevka. Radzinsky claims the fatal shots were fired not by Yusupov but by Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, and that the facts were covered up. Radzinsky also prints the police photographs of Rasputin's corpse, taken shortly after it was pulled from the water on 19 December. His hands are upraised. 'It was clear,' writes Radzinsky, 'that this powerful man, although still breathing in the car, had concealed the fact, hoping to loosen his fetters in the water. But his human strength had failed him.' Actually, this is not 'clear' at all, and proves, on closer inspection, simply to be another sensational assertion for which Radzinsky offers insufficient evidence. Thus Rasputin: the Last Word ends as it has proceeded: gruesome, dramatic, engrossing and irritatingly tendentious.",

Though Evelyn's attitude towards Britain is ambivalent - it is simultaneously the colonial oppressor of the Jewish people, among whose number she attempts to locate herself, and the societal model which determines her own modus vivendi - she chooses British company over that of the multitudinous immigrant 'beings' converging on Palestine. Tel Aviv, with its crowd of caf\u00e9s, prostitutes, neon lights and gateaux, reminds her of Soho. </p> <p>She conceals her looks, dyeing her hair platinum blonde, shaving her dark eyebrows, assuming a distinctively English pseudonym and inventing a British husband for herself. By day, she works at a hairdressing salon; by night, she betrays her expatriate clients and acquaintances in providing Johnny with their names and addresses. </p> <p>Finally, a little dramatic tension colours the plot as various Jewish factions antagonise the British. Evelyn, as may be expected, remains distanced, occupying the position of peripheral spectator, uncertain of where her allegiance lies. For a while, pregnant with Johnny's child, she is hidden by Irgun, the terrorist organisation to which he belongs, but she does not belong with them, nor with the British, nor with Jews. </p> <p>Ultimately, she leaves Palestine, returning 50 years later to confront her youthful self in a neat, somewhat fanciful conclusion, enacted on the balcony of her old apartment. </p> <p>'Always I have edited my life, leaving out whole sections or changing or embroidering details,' admits Evelyn. A mistress of artifice, a pawn or puppet in the machinations of others, experiencing life vicariously, she is a difficult, slippery choice of heroine who never really evolves beyond the 'preliminary sketch' of her youth. Evelyn functions as a token character grafted on to Linda Grant's evocative study of this momentous period in history, implicated by default in order to lend a human angle. </p> <p>Despite the use of the first person, the descriptive narrative offers an objective rather than personal perspective. What redeems the book are sporadic passages of spirited intellectual debate, the vivid sense of place that emerges from Grant's writing, and the stories of the Jewish immigrants which accentuate the premise of this fiction - that a consciousness of the past is vital in articulating a conceivable future.</p>",

By day, she works at a hairdressing salon; by night, she betrays her expatriate clients and acquaintances in providing Johnny with their names and addresses. Finally, a little dramatic tension colours the plot as various Jewish factions antagonise the British. Evelyn, as may be expected, remains distanced, occupying the position of peripheral spectator, uncertain of where her allegiance lies. For a while, pregnant with Johnny's child, she is hidden by Irgun, the terrorist organisation to which he belongs, but she does not belong with them, nor with the British, nor with Jews. Ultimately, she leaves Palestine, returning 50 years later to confront her youthful self in a neat, somewhat fanciful conclusion, enacted on the balcony of her old apartment. 'Always I have edited my life, leaving out whole sections or changing or embroidering details,' admits Evelyn. A mistress of artifice, a pawn or puppet in the machinations of others, experiencing life vicariously, she is a difficult, slippery choice of heroine who never really evolves beyond the 'preliminary sketch' of her youth. Evelyn functions as a token character grafted on to Linda Grant's evocative study of this momentous period in history, implicated by default in order to lend a human angle. Despite the use of the first person, the descriptive narrative offers an objective rather than personal perspective. What redeems the book are sporadic passages of spirited intellectual debate, the vivid sense of place that emerges from Grant's writing, and the stories of the Jewish immigrants which accentuate the premise of this fiction - that a consciousness of the past is vital in articulating a conceivable future.",

      "trailText": "<p>Why look abroad or to exiled old boys when Sir Alex Ferguson's successor is already on the payroll?</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson still has two years left at Manchester United, but the succession question is already the liveliest debate in football. Martin Edwards has admitted the matter is under discussion within the club; last week two Sunday newspapers exclusively predicted two different managers to take over from Ferguson (David O'Leary and Louis van Gaal); and eavesdrop any pub conversation on the subject and you cannot fail to be impressed by the depth of the field and the ingenuity of some of the theories. </p> <p>Perhaps because the situation is such an unusual one in English football - a long-serving and ultra-successful manager making way while his own reputation and that of his club are almost too bright for ordinary mortals to contemplate - the betting odds are all over the place. The field supplied by William Hill resembles the starting line at a particularly unruly Grand National, with selling-platers in with the Classic winners, some no-hopers at the front and several of the fancied runners still facing the wrong way. </p> <p>Granted, any betting show reflects the suppositions of the punters rather than any inside knowledge of the bookmaker, but even so, what has Ars\u00e8ne Wenger done to find himself a rank outsider, sandwiched comically between Paul Ince and George Best? Surely on his record in English football alone, the Arsenal manager ought to be a better bet than Ruud Gullit, Roy Hodgson and Lou Macari, all priced more flatteringly. Surely just by virtue of being a manager, leaving aside the not inconsiderable feat of winning the double a couple of years ago, Wenger should have a slight edge on qualification-free candidates like Eric Cantona, Denis Irwin and Gary Pallister (none of whom has yet demonstrated even an inclination towards management), but clearly the United connection is paramount. The names heading the list are the ones people imagine would jump at the chance to manage United, whatever they might say at the moment, whereas Wenger is evidently considered Arsenal through and through, unlikely to be asked and unlikely to accept. </p> <p>All of which may be true, but how likely is it that Steve Bruce, Gordon Strachan and Bryan Robson will be asked, regardless of whether they would accept? The assumption seems to be that Manchester United will be seeking to replicate Ferguson by following the processes they went through in 1986. Wanted: a promising young(ish) manager with a track record behind him but still something to prove, an Old Trafford old boy if possible but failing that someone with a solid reputation who would fit into the club's traditions and make a name for himself. On this basis, Strachan, O'Leary and Martin O'Neill must be leading candidates, with Alan Curbishley and Peter Reid as outside chances. Bruce is simply unproven, while Robson has made the odd mistake at Middlesbrough and probably lacks the media-savvy necessary to front the monster that Manchester United has become. </p> <p>Because, and this is the crucial point, Manchester United have changed massively since 1986. Nothing about the Old Trafford operation is remotely recognisable from the time Ferguson walked in 14 years ago, and just as the world's first billion-pound football plc would no longer consider selling out to Michael Knighton for \u00a310 million, nor would they contemplate installing a manager, no matter how young and bright, who needed to learn on the job or time to find his feet in European football. In short, if the plc is looking to replicate Ferguson, they want a clone of the manager he is now, not the one who was not even the club's first choice in 1986. United will not necessarily demand a treble in the first season, but the days when Ferguson bought himself time with a solitary FA Cup success after four years are gone. This season United did not even enter the FA Cup, and it is a sobering thought for supporters of the home-based managers mentioned above that not one of them has managed even an FA Cup win with his own club. By the time Ferguson came to England he had ended Old Firm dominance in Cup and League in Scotland, and won the European Cup Winners Cup with Aberdeen. </p> <p>The obvious answer might appear to be to look abroad and hire one of the self-styled super coaches like Van Gaal or Marcello Lippi. Big names, big ideas, big salaries; possibly wouldn't fancy Sunderland on a wet Wednesday night or exchanging their Mediterranean lifestyles for an altogether more austere existence at Carrington Moss. It is debatable whether Manchester United are a bigger football club than Barcelona anyway, though if English clubs continue to flourish in European competitions leading managers will gravitate to the Premiership. Until that happens, however, the element of culture shock (think of Roy Hodgson at Blackburn) will always place a question mark against even the best qualified foreign candidates, which is why the assimilated and already successful Wenger might not be such a long shot after all. </p> <p>Foreign coaches also tend to bring in foreign players, which worked out well for Wenger at Arsenal, yet still causes resentment for Van Gaal at Barcelona. If stability and continuity are United's goals, anything potentially disruptive is to be avoided. It is one thing for a foreign 'guru' (Ferguson's word, not entirely approving) to walk into an underachieving club and change things around, as Wenger did at Arsenal and G\u00e9rard Houllier is attempting to do at Liverpool, but the same approach could quickly lead to problems for a phenomenally successful side with nowhere to go but down. </p> <p>Which brings us to the biggest difficulty of all. It is not safe to assume that any given manager would fancy taking over from Ferguson. There is precious little room for improvement and plenty of scope for spectacular failure. Furthermore, by the time Ferguson leaves, the United dressing room is likely to be full of players who have won everything there is to win in England and Europe, two, three and four times over. Practically every candidate so far mentioned as a possibility would find his own experience dwarfed by that of his players. It is a daunting proposition, professional sportsmen at the highest level being almost psychopathic in their intolerance of weakness or indecision in others, and some of the managers politely distancing themselves from the job at the moment may not be playing games. As Knighton said on Friday, 'The shrewdest invitee would probably turn it down.' </p> <p>Former England managers Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle have the stature and breadth of experience for the task, which makes you wonder why they are quoted at the same price as Mark McGhee and Ray Wilkins, but the golden rule in these situations is to look for the candidate who comes closest to doing the job already. The trouble with United's old boys is that they might as well have played for a different club; nor do management duties at Coventry or Huddersfield have much in common with the Old Trafford beat. Who is playing for United now, synonymous with their success in the past decade and symbolic of their insatiable desire for more? Who already has the respect of everyone at Old Trafford, embodies every bit of Ferguson's combative spirit, and represents the best hope of a seamless transition? </p> <p>Step forward Roy Keane, assisted by Steve McLaren and/or Brian Kidd. In two years time Keane will be 31, three years younger than Kenny Dalglish was when he took over at Liverpool, but with 10 seasons at United on his cv. Whether he will make a manager in the Ferguson mould is a matter for conjecture, but the point about managers in the Ferguson mould is that they are becoming extinct. It is unrealistic, for example, to expect the next United manager to last 16 years, and unnecessary to require him to have learnt his trade at St Mirren or some other impoverished outfit. Manchester United now make their own rules. </p> <p>Keane could do a job, bridge a gap, take the club on, and is unlikely to shrink from the challenge. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Alex Ferguson still has two years left at Manchester United, but the succession question is already the liveliest debate in football. Martin Edwards has admitted the matter is under discussion within the club; last week two Sunday newspapers exclusively predicted two different managers to take over from Ferguson (David O'Leary and Louis van Gaal); and eavesdrop any pub conversation on the subject and you cannot fail to be impressed by the depth of the field and the ingenuity of some of the theories. Perhaps because the situation is such an unusual one in English football - a long-serving and ultra-successful manager making way while his own reputation and that of his club are almost too bright for ordinary mortals to contemplate - the betting odds are all over the place. The field supplied by William Hill resembles the starting line at a particularly unruly Grand National, with selling-platers in with the Classic winners, some no-hopers at the front and several of the fancied runners still facing the wrong way. Granted, any betting show reflects the suppositions of the punters rather than any inside knowledge of the bookmaker, but even so, what has Ars\u00e8ne Wenger done to find himself a rank outsider, sandwiched comically between Paul Ince and George Best? Surely on his record in English football alone, the Arsenal manager ought to be a better bet than Ruud Gullit, Roy Hodgson and Lou Macari, all priced more flatteringly. Surely just by virtue of being a manager, leaving aside the not inconsiderable feat of winning the double a couple of years ago, Wenger should have a slight edge on qualification-free candidates like Eric Cantona, Denis Irwin and Gary Pallister (none of whom has yet demonstrated even an inclination towards management), but clearly the United connection is paramount. The names heading the list are the ones people imagine would jump at the chance to manage United, whatever they might say at the moment, whereas Wenger is evidently considered Arsenal through and through, unlikely to be asked and unlikely to accept. All of which may be true, but how likely is it that Steve Bruce, Gordon Strachan and Bryan Robson will be asked, regardless of whether they would accept? The assumption seems to be that Manchester United will be seeking to replicate Ferguson by following the processes they went through in 1986. Wanted: a promising young(ish) manager with a track record behind him but still something to prove, an Old Trafford old boy if possible but failing that someone with a solid reputation who would fit into the club's traditions and make a name for himself. On this basis, Strachan, O'Leary and Martin O'Neill must be leading candidates, with Alan Curbishley and Peter Reid as outside chances. Bruce is simply unproven, while Robson has made the odd mistake at Middlesbrough and probably lacks the media-savvy necessary to front the monster that Manchester United has become. Because, and this is the crucial point, Manchester United have changed massively since 1986. Nothing about the Old Trafford operation is remotely recognisable from the time Ferguson walked in 14 years ago, and just as the world's first billion-pound football plc would no longer consider selling out to Michael Knighton for \u00a310 million, nor would they contemplate installing a manager, no matter how young and bright, who needed to learn on the job or time to find his feet in European football. In short, if the plc is looking to replicate Ferguson, they want a clone of the manager he is now, not the one who was not even the club's first choice in 1986. United will not necessarily demand a treble in the first season, but the days when Ferguson bought himself time with a solitary FA Cup success after four years are gone. This season United did not even enter the FA Cup, and it is a sobering thought for supporters of the home-based managers mentioned above that not one of them has managed even an FA Cup win with his own club. By the time Ferguson came to England he had ended Old Firm dominance in Cup and League in Scotland, and won the European Cup Winners Cup with Aberdeen. The obvious answer might appear to be to look abroad and hire one of the self-styled super coaches like Van Gaal or Marcello Lippi. Big names, big ideas, big salaries; possibly wouldn't fancy Sunderland on a wet Wednesday night or exchanging their Mediterranean lifestyles for an altogether more austere existence at Carrington Moss. It is debatable whether Manchester United are a bigger football club than Barcelona anyway, though if English clubs continue to flourish in European competitions leading managers will gravitate to the Premiership. Until that happens, however, the element of culture shock (think of Roy Hodgson at Blackburn) will always place a question mark against even the best qualified foreign candidates, which is why the assimilated and already successful Wenger might not be such a long shot after all. Foreign coaches also tend to bring in foreign players, which worked out well for Wenger at Arsenal, yet still causes resentment for Van Gaal at Barcelona. If stability and continuity are United's goals, anything potentially disruptive is to be avoided. It is one thing for a foreign 'guru' (Ferguson's word, not entirely approving) to walk into an underachieving club and change things around, as Wenger did at Arsenal and G\u00e9rard Houllier is attempting to do at Liverpool, but the same approach could quickly lead to problems for a phenomenally successful side with nowhere to go but down. Which brings us to the biggest difficulty of all. It is not safe to assume that any given manager would fancy taking over from Ferguson. There is precious little room for improvement and plenty of scope for spectacular failure. Furthermore, by the time Ferguson leaves, the United dressing room is likely to be full of players who have won everything there is to win in England and Europe, two, three and four times over. Practically every candidate so far mentioned as a possibility would find his own experience dwarfed by that of his players. It is a daunting proposition, professional sportsmen at the highest level being almost psychopathic in their intolerance of weakness or indecision in others, and some of the managers politely distancing themselves from the job at the moment may not be playing games. As Knighton said on Friday, 'The shrewdest invitee would probably turn it down.' Former England managers Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle have the stature and breadth of experience for the task, which makes you wonder why they are quoted at the same price as Mark McGhee and Ray Wilkins, but the golden rule in these situations is to look for the candidate who comes closest to doing the job already. The trouble with United's old boys is that they might as well have played for a different club; nor do management duties at Coventry or Huddersfield have much in common with the Old Trafford beat. Who is playing for United now, synonymous with their success in the past decade and symbolic of their insatiable desire for more? Who already has the respect of everyone at Old Trafford, embodies every bit of Ferguson's combative spirit, and represents the best hope of a seamless transition? Step forward Roy Keane, assisted by Steve McLaren and/or Brian Kidd. In two years time Keane will be 31, three years younger than Kenny Dalglish was when he took over at Liverpool, but with 10 seasons at United on his cv. Whether he will make a manager in the Ferguson mould is a matter for conjecture, but the point about managers in the Ferguson mould is that they are becoming extinct. It is unrealistic, for example, to expect the next United manager to last 16 years, and unnecessary to require him to have learnt his trade at St Mirren or some other impoverished outfit. Manchester United now make their own rules. Keane could do a job, bridge a gap, take the club on, and is unlikely to shrink from the challenge.",

      "byline": "Hugh McIlvanney",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With Manchester United and the European Cup it is always difficult to identify the boundary between the dream and the reality; to separate an objective expectation of failure from a dark, mystical suspicion that a mocking providence must always thwart Matt Busby's ultimate ambition. </p> <p>What happened in Madrid on Wednesday did nothing to clarify these distinctions. The match that saw United through the semi-final at the fourth attempt was in many important respects the most bizarre, the most unnaturally (almost supernaturally) dramatic I have experienced. It was, for me at least, unique, with an essential pattern that denied comparison with any other game I have seen. </p> <p>It could be suggested that the emotions of the past 11 years, the memories of those major and minor disasters this club has known in European football, rose like sediment from the bottom of a glass to cloud perspectives. </p> <p>But that interpretation will convince no one who sat through the stifling hour and a half in the Bernabeu Stadium, whose sheer sides seemed to imprison the clamour and the stale air under a blue ceiling of cigarette and cigar smoke. </p> <p>United, by their own standards, played moderately; Real Madrid played worse; inadequate defence had more significance than inspired attack. However, all this is only a limited version of the truth. The discrepancy between the events of the first half and those of the second was so staggering as to be unreal. </p> <p>After coping skilfully, if rather uneasily, with Real Madrid's swift, controlled aggression for slightly more than 25 minutes, United's reinforced defence all but disintegrated. Pirri was pursued too late when he sprinted towards the near post to strike a, fine, powerful header beyond Stepney. Brennan, going to make an easy interception, was unfortunate to find the ball bubbling over his foot and Gento was left to race in unhampered. Stepney could not prevent the ball from spinning between his legs. </p> <p>Zoco, incredibly transformed from the strong man of Old Trafford to a nervous incompetent, restored hope briefly by slicing Dunne's free-kick past Betancort, but the speed of the great Amancio's reflexes brought a third Spanish goal almost immediately. </p> <p>At half time, anyone who wanted to bet on United might have been trampled in the rush, and by British feet at that. </p> <p>What occurred subsequently was barely comprehensible. It was natural that United should commit themselves unreservedly to attack, with Sadler surging away from Foulkes's side, Charlton eagerly seeking openings for shots and Crerand moving through like an inside forward. But for all their adventurousness there was no impression of overwhelming menace and when the Real defence suddenly opened up to let them through it appeared to be a process as arbitrary as the parting of the Red Sea. It was as if some outside force had chosen to reward United for their greatness over the years and at one stroke had drained all their opponents' resistance.. There must be praise for the cool alertness that gave Sadler and Foulkes their decisive goals and even more for the brilliance with which Best prepared the way for the winner, but a sound defence would probably have prevented both. </p> <p>'We played the double centre-half plan in their penalty area,' said Pat Crerand afterwards, condemning the opposition with a joke.

      "bodyText": "With Manchester United and the European Cup it is always difficult to identify the boundary between the dream and the reality; to separate an objective expectation of failure from a dark, mystical suspicion that a mocking providence must always thwart Matt Busby's ultimate ambition. What happened in Madrid on Wednesday did nothing to clarify these distinctions. The match that saw United through the semi-final at the fourth attempt was in many important respects the most bizarre, the most unnaturally (almost supernaturally) dramatic I have experienced. It was, for me at least, unique, with an essential pattern that denied comparison with any other game I have seen. It could be suggested that the emotions of the past 11 years, the memories of those major and minor disasters this club has known in European football, rose like sediment from the bottom of a glass to cloud perspectives. But that interpretation will convince no one who sat through the stifling hour and a half in the Bernabeu Stadium, whose sheer sides seemed to imprison the clamour and the stale air under a blue ceiling of cigarette and cigar smoke. United, by their own standards, played moderately; Real Madrid played worse; inadequate defence had more significance than inspired attack. However, all this is only a limited version of the truth. The discrepancy between the events of the first half and those of the second was so staggering as to be unreal. After coping skilfully, if rather uneasily, with Real Madrid's swift, controlled aggression for slightly more than 25 minutes, United's reinforced defence all but disintegrated. Pirri was pursued too late when he sprinted towards the near post to strike a, fine, powerful header beyond Stepney. Brennan, going to make an easy interception, was unfortunate to find the ball bubbling over his foot and Gento was left to race in unhampered. Stepney could not prevent the ball from spinning between his legs. Zoco, incredibly transformed from the strong man of Old Trafford to a nervous incompetent, restored hope briefly by slicing Dunne's free-kick past Betancort, but the speed of the great Amancio's reflexes brought a third Spanish goal almost immediately. At half time, anyone who wanted to bet on United might have been trampled in the rush, and by British feet at that. What occurred subsequently was barely comprehensible. It was natural that United should commit themselves unreservedly to attack, with Sadler surging away from Foulkes's side, Charlton eagerly seeking openings for shots and Crerand moving through like an inside forward. But for all their adventurousness there was no impression of overwhelming menace and when the Real defence suddenly opened up to let them through it appeared to be a process as arbitrary as the parting of the Red Sea. It was as if some outside force had chosen to reward United for their greatness over the years and at one stroke had drained all their opponents' resistance.. There must be praise for the cool alertness that gave Sadler and Foulkes their decisive goals and even more for the brilliance with which Best prepared the way for the winner, but a sound defence would probably have prevented both. 'We played the double centre-half plan in their penalty area,' said Pat Crerand afterwards, condemning the opposition with a joke. So what did happen? There is a choice of practical explanations. 'We went out and played them,' Nobby Stiles shouted from behind a towel in the steaming, swigging, hugging, tearful hysteria of the dressing room. 'We went out and bloody played them and they cracked.' Crerand elaborated. 'When we came in at half-time Georgie Best said \"We're as well losing 10-1 as 3-1. Let's have a real go at them.\" The boss felt the same way. They made it easier by letting us have the ball in the second half. They must have thought they had done enough. Whenever we got moving they were knackered. You couldn't breathe out there because of the humidity. They kept running over to the trainer to get drinks and have water splashed down their neck.

'There was no air at all. You couldn't sprint because it took you five minutes to recover. We didn't play nearly as well as we can but the lads deserved it because they kept going. They had the heart when most would have slung it.' This takes us some way towards the basic truth about the match.

In the country to promote Milan's youth links with British clubs, the 1982 World Cup winner said he was open to offers. 'Having worked with Milan since retiring, I am ready to move. If the opportunity comes up in England, I will consider it. </p> <p>'In Italy we are very proud that Gianluca Vialli has done so well. He has brought a lot of his Italian experience and a lot of Italian feeling to the Chelsea team. Football is very different in England to Italy but English football is now at a high level, it has grown up a lot. If I get the opportunity, I would love to expand my horizons.' </p> <p> <strong> Brazilian fury at 'traitor' Pele</strong> </p> <p>The head of the Brazilian FA (CBF) has told Pele he will be to blame if Brazil lose the race to host the 2006 World Cup. 'Pele has not stopped criticising the candidature of his own country,' Ricardo Teixeira said last week. 'If we are rejected, it will be his fault.' He claimed that in recent meetings Pele had given misleading information about Brazilian stadia and security standards. 'It pains me that he is opposed to his own country in this way.' Legendary former striker Zico, acting sports ambassador, has joined the criticism. 'First he supported South Africa, later England, now Germany. Why does he not say what his true reason is for being against our bid and leave vanity aside?' Teixeira says the fact that Pele's sports marketing company wasn't commissioned to front Brazil's campaign has nothing to do with it. </p> <p> <strong> Transfer deadline: China snap</strong> </p> <p>Not the biggest deadline day transfer, but certainly the strangest. The deal involved Mark Blake, a former Fulham defender under Kevin Keegan, who signed for Aldershot last week - via China. The process began a month ago when Blake, 32, was playing for Cannes. At the suggestion of former Everton man Paul Rideout, he agreed to move to Chinese side Chongqing Vanguard, who offered him a massive wage. But after three good performances it all went wrong. </p> <p>'I was in my room getting my training gear on at 9am,' he explains, 'when the kit manager burst in. He pointed at me, then started making aircraft noises and holding his arms out like wings. Next he grabs my case and starts pushing my things in. </p> <p>'I couldn't believe what was going on. They bundled me into a car and drove me to the airport at Pusan, pushed me through the checkpoints and vanished.' Blake had to wait two days for a flight to France, and arrived back \u00a32,000 out of pocket, and unemployed, until Aldershot took him on. </p> <p>'Paul heard that my club lost a sponsor at the last minute,' says Blake, 'but it's still unbelievable to think what kind of behaviour they can get away with.' The PFA, and Fifa, are on the case. </p> <p> <strong> Guinan: buns, banter and what else?</strong> </p> <p>Cambridge United's decision to sack striker Steve Guinan last week has provoked much speculation. According to manager Roy McFarland, the striker was thrown out for 'totally unacceptable behaviour' at the club's sportsman's dinner - the toughest disciplinary action Cambridge have ever taken. 'Things go off all the time in football in training and on trips,' said McFarland, 'but this was completely unacceptable.' He refused, though, to go into detail, as did the player. So what happened? </p> <p>'They were well out of order,' says an anonymous attendee, who denied reports that the incident developed into an ugly vomit and trouser-dropping routine.

The following year they won the Cup and were champions again in 1911. But soon afterwards Mangnall made what would today be an unthinkable switch, leaving to join Manchester City. </p> <p><strong> John Bentley (1912-14)</strong> If player power was not quite the force of today, it was almost certainly one reason for Bentley's reign as manager being brief. United finished only fourteenth in his second season amid rumours that his style had upset senior players. He stood down in December 1914, resuming his old role as club secretary. </p> <p><strong> John Robson (1914-21)</strong> His largely undistinguished spell at least achieved one record, a crowd of 70,504 at Old Trafford against Aston Villa in 1920. After the war United disappointed, finishing twelfth and thirteenth. </p> <p><strong> John Chapman (1921-26)</strong> Chapman was lucky to survive a start of only one win in 15 matches that led to relega tion. But they returned and he took them to within one match of their first Wembley final, denied by Ernest Mangnall's Manchester City. The FA later accused him of 'improper conduct' - no details were disclosed - and suspended him. </p> <p><strong> Lal Hilditch (1926-27)</strong> Rushed into the job after John Chapman's suspension, Hilditch, a left-sided midfielder, became the first player-manager in the English First Division but was never more than a stopgap. Allegedly, he never had a foul given against him in his career. </p> <p><strong> Herbert Bamlett (1927-31)</strong> He was unsuccessful, spectacularly so in 1930-31 when United lost their first 12 matches, scoring 14 goals and conceding 49. They went down and Bamlett was sacked. </p> <p><strong> Walter Crickmer (1931-32; 37-45)</strong> Never officially appointed manager, filling in after Bamlett's disastrous season and again during World War Two. But he was responsible for the youth policy that would flourish under Matt Busby and Jimmy Murphy. The man who had joined United as a clerk in 1919 died in the 1958 Munich air crash. </p> <p><strong> Scott Duncan (1932-37) </strong> At first, United's decline continued under Duncan, a 2-0 win at Millwall in May 1934 saving them from sliding into Third Division North. A revival took them to the Second Division title in 1935-36, but they went straight back down again. Duncan resigned in November 1937 and went to Ipswich, where his wife, troubled by Manchester's pollution, found the air more to her liking. </p> <p><strong> Matt Busby (1945-69; 70-71)</strong> With his assistant Jimmy Murphy, Busby created United's first great post-war team around players like Johnny Carey and Charlie Mitten. Then came the legendary Busby Babes, eight of whom died at Munich. Busby himself nearly perished and twice received the last rites. His trailblazing in Europe, initially against Football League wishes, delivered the famous 1968 European Cup final win over Benfica. He returned briefly as manager in 1970-71. </p> <p><strong> Wilf McGuinness (1969-70)</strong> His 13 games for United in 1955-56 meant he qualified for a title medal, but injury forced him to retire young. His spell as manager, after Busby's enormous success, was ill-starred and he was demoted to reserve coach. </p> <p><strong> Frank O'Farrell (1971-72)</strong> Quietly successful at Torquay and Leicester, the universally liked O'Farrell made a triumphant start to the 1970-71 season at Old Trafford with only one defeat in 14 games. He also did United the immense favour of signing Martin Buchan, who would play 455 League and Cup games for the club. Otherwise, his first season turned steadily sour and after a poor start to the next one he was dismissed. </p> <p><strong> Tommy Docherty (1972-77)</strong> A fans' favourite, he survived United's return to the Second Division and repaid the club's loyalty by masterminding their immediate promotion. Huge crowds returned to Old Trafford and FA Cup final appearances followed in 1976 and 1977. It all ended, though, after he had an affair with the club physiotherapist's wife Mary Brown. </p> <p><strong> Dave Sexton (1977-81)</strong> He broke the club's transfer record four times - Joe Jordan (\u00a3388,888), Gordon McQueen (\u00a3450,000), Ray Wilkins (\u00a3700,000) and Garry Birtles (\u00a31.25 million) - but his teams never quite produced an acceptable dividend on this massive expenditure. An FA Cup Final appearance in 1979 and second in the First Division in 1980 were deemed insufficient and the board fired him. </p> <p><strong> Ron Atkinson (1981-86)</strong> Atkinson, brash and confident, signalled a change of atmosphere at Old Trafford after Sexton's introspective reign. Bryan Robson arrived immediately in a \u00a31.5m deal that also included Remi Moses and there were FA Cup triumphs in 1983 and 1985. In 1986, United won their first 10 League games and at one stage led the First Division by 10 points. But injuries and Liverpool caught up with them and in November 1986, after a five-year association, United and Atkinson parted company. </p> <p><strong> Alex Ferguson (1986-)</strong> On his third anniversary a fans' banner read: 'Three years of excuses: Ta-ra Fergie.' The turnaround began with Cup successes and reached completion with the start of the Premier League in 1992-93 when United became champions for the first time for 26 years. Since then a blend of British and overseas talent has triumphed, finishing the millennium with their famous treble. </p>",

According to Terry Yorath (above), first-team coach at Bradford City and former manager of Lebanon, foreign folk admire the traditional British values. 'Basically it's our honesty,' he says. Recruitment can be an unusual process - Yorath got his job in Lebanon more by luck than judgement, through a friend who worked in the building trade there. But what could possibly convince a coach to give up his comfortable life and transport himself half way across the globe? 'It gives you an opportunity to get involved with a different way of life,' says Yorath. 'It's not always easy.

Another error of judgment by hapless English batsmen. The pair are still going; they may still be rolling in when the West Indies come to England in May. </p> <p>Walsh leads the way.

He loves the game too much and he may take heed of the observation of Dennis Waight, the long-serving physio to the West Indies team: 'I've got a feeling that if Courtney stops playing, he'll never get started again.'

For a decade from 1984, when he made his Test debut, Walsh was the support bowler of the West Indian quartet; the uncomplaining workhorse who would bowl into the wind and shut an end up on long hot afternoons.

Walsh instinctively agreed to keep going and gave Lara his public backing (much-needed since Lara's first game in charge was to be in Jamaica). Moreover he supported him wholeheartedly throughout that 1998 series and beyond. His small ego and big heart dictated that he could do nothing else, a reaction that surprised no one in Kingston or his adopted home of Bristol.

      "bodyText": "After their last two series against the West Indies tormented England cricketers have tossed their bats into their bags and consoled one another with the thought: 'Well, at least we won't have to deal with Courtney and Curtly again.' Another error of judgment by hapless English batsmen. The pair are still going; they may still be rolling in when the West Indies come to England in May. Walsh leads the way. In Jamaica, on his home patch, he is on the verge becoming the highest Test wicket-taker of all time, surpassing Kapil Dev's tally of 434. This will be no guarantee that the old boy (he's 37) decides to call it a day. He loves the game too much and he may take heed of the observation of Dennis Waight, the long-serving physio to the West Indies team: 'I've got a feeling that if Courtney stops playing, he'll never get started again.'

      "body": "<p>Football is finally to get a watchdog to penalise greedy clubs that rip off fans by overcharging for tickets and replica shirts. </p> <p>Tony Blair's former Whitehall 'enforcer', Jack Cunningham, is set to chair the new body, which will 'name and shame' clubs that exploit their supporters. It will investigate complaints from fans and criticise clubs which disobey a new code of practice. </p> <p>But Cunningham's likely appointment as head of soccer's Independent Scrutiny Panel has triggered a row over his suitability. There is concern that the former Cabinet Minister, dubbed 'Junket Jack' for his love of the high life, may not be ideal to investigate 'fat cat' clubs which allegedly abuse their fans' affections. </p> <p>Cunningham sparked controversy during his two and a half years in the Cabinet by flying first-class on Concorde, staying in the best hotels and ordering a \u00a32,000 mahogany table for his office. Questions were asked when he was Agriculture Minister about his decision to move his department from its unglamorous Whitehall base to swankier headquarters. </p> <p>Some Ministers and fans' representatives also fear his close links with Newcastle United, which he has supported since boyhood, could prove a weakness. The club recently attracted widespread contempt for forcing several thousand of its own supporters to move from their regular seats near the pitch to accommodate corporate customers paying much higher prices. </p> <p>However, Cunningham has the Prime Minister's backing for the post - a Government appointment - and is the choice of soccer's ruling bodies, the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League. He is rated '98 per cent certain' to get it, despite the reservations. </p> <p>The Government's decision to police the national sport through the panel means it has rejected, pleas from fans to set up a legally-backed regulator. Supporters' representatives, who want a powerful 'football audit commission' modelled on the telecommunications and water watchdogs Oftel and Ofwat, will see the panel as a toothless talking-shop. </p> <p>But a Government insider said: 'We might still legislate for a full-blown regulator; we will keep that sword of Damocles hanging over football. </p> <p>'But we will give the game two years to prove the ISP is all that's needed to improve the way the game is governed and remind clubs they mustn't take advantage of their fans.' </p> <p>The body's powers will provoke a furious debate. It will investigate clubs but be able only to recommend, rather than ensure, remedial action. Much of its clout will rest on how clubs react if they are identified in new 'performance league tables' as having failed to consult fans, attract enough young supporters or treat visiting fans fairly. </p> <p>Fans wanted a mainly advisory body which they would control. But football has finally agreed not to seek representation on the panel, and accepted that its membership has to be truly independent. The body will be in place for the start of the new season in August. </p> <p> denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</p>",

Tony Blair's former Whitehall 'enforcer', Jack Cunningham, is set to chair the new body, which will 'name and shame' clubs that exploit their supporters. It will investigate complaints from fans and criticise clubs which disobey a new code of practice. But Cunningham's likely appointment as head of soccer's Independent Scrutiny Panel has triggered a row over his suitability. There is concern that the former Cabinet Minister, dubbed 'Junket Jack' for his love of the high life, may not be ideal to investigate 'fat cat' clubs which allegedly abuse their fans' affections. Cunningham sparked controversy during his two and a half years in the Cabinet by flying first-class on Concorde, staying in the best hotels and ordering a \u00a32,000 mahogany table for his office. Questions were asked when he was Agriculture Minister about his decision to move his department from its unglamorous Whitehall base to swankier headquarters. Some Ministers and fans' representatives also fear his close links with Newcastle United, which he has supported since boyhood, could prove a weakness. The club recently attracted widespread contempt for forcing several thousand of its own supporters to move from their regular seats near the pitch to accommodate corporate customers paying much higher prices. However, Cunningham has the Prime Minister's backing for the post - a Government appointment - and is the choice of soccer's ruling bodies, the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League. He is rated '98 per cent certain' to get it, despite the reservations. The Government's decision to police the national sport through the panel means it has rejected, pleas from fans to set up a legally-backed regulator. Supporters' representatives, who want a powerful 'football audit commission' modelled on the telecommunications and water watchdogs Oftel and Ofwat, will see the panel as a toothless talking-shop. But a Government insider said: 'We might still legislate for a full-blown regulator; we will keep that sword of Damocles hanging over football. 'But we will give the game two years to prove the ISP is all that's needed to improve the way the game is governed and remind clubs they mustn't take advantage of their fans.' The body's powers will provoke a furious debate. It will investigate clubs but be able only to recommend, rather than ensure, remedial action. Much of its clout will rest on how clubs react if they are identified in new 'performance league tables' as having failed to consult fans, attract enough young supporters or treat visiting fans fairly. Fans wanted a mainly advisory body which they would control. But football has finally agreed not to seek representation on the panel, and accepted that its membership has to be truly independent. The body will be in place for the start of the new season in August. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Former Crystal Palace owner Ron Noades insisted yesterday that he will not allow the club to go out of business. Noades will have to put his money where his mouth is within the next four weeks because the Palace administrators fear that their fixture at Ipswich, on 25 April, could be the last in the club's history. </p> <p>This latest performance was another testament to the character of Steve Coppell and his players as they matched the runaway First Division leaders kick for kick. </p> <p>Charlton just deserved the win, secured through an 82nd-minute goal from substitute Paul Kitson, but they need not have been so greedy against their struggling neighbours. Charlton are going back to the Premiership next season with a \u00a314 million transfer fund. Palace may not even exist then and Charlton's first win here in 65 years may also be their last. </p> <p>As so often in the past, Palace's plight has brought out the best in their supporters, who continue to back the players and have raised around \u00a31 million in an attempt to help keep the club afloat. </p> <p>The Football Association will need to risk their 2006 World Cup bid by going to war with Fifa to solve the problem. Unless they can persuade the game's world governing body to solve the \u00a35.5 million debt Palace owe to Juventus and Strasbourg, there will be no lifesaving takeover. </p> <p>So Noades, the current owner-manager of Brentford who retained the ownership of Selhurst Park and the Palace training ground when he sold the club, holds the key. </p> <p>'I have told the administrators that I will not let the club go into liquidation,' he said. 'That is why I cannot understand why they have not encouraged bids other than Jerry Lim's to come forward. </p> <p>'Perhaps they are playing a tactical game to get the creditors to accept what is already on the table'. </p> <p>Coppell said: 'The position is that Jerry Lim wants to buy the club, but we have this Juventus and Strasbourg problem. The Football League support us, but the FA will not because of the \u00a35.5 million owing in transfer fees. Fifa say we have a moral obligation to pay and the FA are not prepared to go against them at the moment. </p> <p>'The players and I are desperate to get to the end of the season. They are still owed \u00a31 million in back wages and have been superb. </p> <p>'But the extension of all this is that we will go out of business when the money runs out. The administrator told me this week that that day will come before the end of the season because he will have a legal obligation to go to the court and say it is not worth carrying on here any more.' </p> <p>In the circumstances the result may have seemed relatively unimportant to the outside world, but the reason Selhurst Park was a rare sell-out yesterday had nothing to do with fans uniting and digging deep to help a club survive. </p> <p>The pride of South London is at stake when Palace and Charlton meet, and both sets of supporters let their teams know this was a must-win occasion. It was something of a shame that the passion from the terraces seemed to float over the players at times. </p> <p>A lame opening featured little more than a speculative long-range effort from Palace's on-loan Chelsea striker Mikael Forssell. </p> <p>There was a low shot at the other end from John Robinson, and a strong run by Shaun Newton ended with a shot last seen heading towards the Sainsbury's car park. </p> <p>Forssell did shoot the ball into the back of the net on the half-hour, but that effort was disallowed for an earlier push and the match was in danger of drifting towards half time on a wave of mediocrity. </p> <p>Nine minutes before the break Robinson broke clear on the left and picked out Newton, unmarked and 10 yards from goal, but the midfielder stumbled and fluffed his shot, allowing Ashley Cole to make a goal-line clearance. </p> <p>Then Palace sparked. Dean Austin went close with a header, Forssell narrowly missed with a bicycle kick and Hayden Mullins shot a couple of feet over the bar. </p> <p>A half-time hailstorm was still driving down when the teams restarted on a now partially white and very slippery pitch, and Charlton began to exert some control. They should have taken the lead when Matthias Svensson headed down to present Andy Hunt with an open goal. But Hunt slipped and ended up with a muddy backside. </p> <p>The home fans broke into another chorus of 'I'm Palace Till I Die'. An admirable sentiment, but there may not be a Palace before long. The more people sit back in the thought that it just can't end in tears, the more unlikely it will be that Palace will see out the season. They won't be the last club to fall in the current climate, but it will be a crying shame if Crystal Palace become Crystal Paralysis. </p>",

Noades will have to put his money where his mouth is within the next four weeks because the Palace administrators fear that their fixture at Ipswich, on 25 April, could be the last in the club's history. This latest performance was another testament to the character of Steve Coppell and his players as they matched the runaway First Division leaders kick for kick. Charlton just deserved the win, secured through an 82nd-minute goal from substitute Paul Kitson, but they need not have been so greedy against their struggling neighbours. Charlton are going back to the Premiership next season with a \u00a314 million transfer fund. Palace may not even exist then and Charlton's first win here in 65 years may also be their last. As so often in the past, Palace's plight has brought out the best in their supporters, who continue to back the players and have raised around \u00a31 million in an attempt to help keep the club afloat. The Football Association will need to risk their 2006 World Cup bid by going to war with Fifa to solve the problem. Unless they can persuade the game's world governing body to solve the \u00a35.5 million debt Palace owe to Juventus and Strasbourg, there will be no lifesaving takeover. So Noades, the current owner-manager of Brentford who retained the ownership of Selhurst Park and the Palace training ground when he sold the club, holds the key. 'I have told the administrators that I will not let the club go into liquidation,' he said. 'That is why I cannot understand why they have not encouraged bids other than Jerry Lim's to come forward. 'Perhaps they are playing a tactical game to get the creditors to accept what is already on the table'. Coppell said: 'The position is that Jerry Lim wants to buy the club, but we have this Juventus and Strasbourg problem. The Football League support us, but the FA will not because of the \u00a35.5 million owing in transfer fees. Fifa say we have a moral obligation to pay and the FA are not prepared to go against them at the moment. 'The players and I are desperate to get to the end of the season. They are still owed \u00a31 million in back wages and have been superb. 'But the extension of all this is that we will go out of business when the money runs out. The administrator told me this week that that day will come before the end of the season because he will have a legal obligation to go to the court and say it is not worth carrying on here any more.' In the circumstances the result may have seemed relatively unimportant to the outside world, but the reason Selhurst Park was a rare sell-out yesterday had nothing to do with fans uniting and digging deep to help a club survive. The pride of South London is at stake when Palace and Charlton meet, and both sets of supporters let their teams know this was a must-win occasion. It was something of a shame that the passion from the terraces seemed to float over the players at times. A lame opening featured little more than a speculative long-range effort from Palace's on-loan Chelsea striker Mikael Forssell. There was a low shot at the other end from John Robinson, and a strong run by Shaun Newton ended with a shot last seen heading towards the Sainsbury's car park. Forssell did shoot the ball into the back of the net on the half-hour, but that effort was disallowed for an earlier push and the match was in danger of drifting towards half time on a wave of mediocrity. Nine minutes before the break Robinson broke clear on the left and picked out Newton, unmarked and 10 yards from goal, but the midfielder stumbled and fluffed his shot, allowing Ashley Cole to make a goal-line clearance. Then Palace sparked. Dean Austin went close with a header, Forssell narrowly missed with a bicycle kick and Hayden Mullins shot a couple of feet over the bar. A half-time hailstorm was still driving down when the teams restarted on a now partially white and very slippery pitch, and Charlton began to exert some control. They should have taken the lead when Matthias Svensson headed down to present Andy Hunt with an open goal. But Hunt slipped and ended up with a muddy backside. The home fans broke into another chorus of 'I'm Palace Till I Die'. An admirable sentiment, but there may not be a Palace before long. The more people sit back in the thought that it just can't end in tears, the more unlikely it will be that Palace will see out the season. They won't be the last club to fall in the current climate, but it will be a crying shame if Crystal Palace become Crystal Paralysis.",

      "body": "<p>Only a last-minute goal by substitute Jamie Redknapp saved Liverpool from another embarrassing home draw which would have raised doubts about their Champions League ambitions. Steven Gerrard, who made the first goal for Titi Camara, was rash enough to suggest beforehand that Liverpool were capable of overtaking Leeds for second position. Unless they get their act together in front of goal, they will be lucky to stay in third place. </p> <p>This fixture has a reputation for goals, and the ball was in the back of the Newcastle net after 10 seconds, but Paul Durkin's whistle for a push on Steve Howey was heard well before David Thompson beat Shay Given. At the breathless rate Liverpool started, a real goal seemed imminent. Newcastle could barely get out of their half as Liverpool swarmed forward, and even without Michael Owen there were enough touches from Emile Heskey and Camara to keep the home crowd roaring encouragement. </p> <p>Yet times have changed since these two sides used to trade goals in batches.

      "bodyText": "Only a last-minute goal by substitute Jamie Redknapp saved Liverpool from another embarrassing home draw which would have raised doubts about their Champions League ambitions. Steven Gerrard, who made the first goal for Titi Camara, was rash enough to suggest beforehand that Liverpool were capable of overtaking Leeds for second position. Unless they get their act together in front of goal, they will be lucky to stay in third place. This fixture has a reputation for goals, and the ball was in the back of the Newcastle net after 10 seconds, but Paul Durkin's whistle for a push on Steve Howey was heard well before David Thompson beat Shay Given. At the breathless rate Liverpool started, a real goal seemed imminent. Newcastle could barely get out of their half as Liverpool swarmed forward, and even without Michael Owen there were enough touches from Emile Heskey and Camara to keep the home crowd roaring encouragement. Yet times have changed since these two sides used to trade goals in batches. Liverpool have stiffened their defence with the arrival of Sami Hyypia and Stephane Henchoz, and Newcastle under Bobby Robson are no longer the generous opponents of Kevin Keegan's time. But as the first half wore on, with hardly a shot for either goalkeeper to save, the realisation dawned that two once-formidable attacking sides are now sadly diminished. Newcastle could be the more readily excused since they do not have anything to play for, and as the away side were content to let Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson go through their nuisance repertoire as isolated presences upfield.

      "body": "<p>Once again a football team have gripped France, although this time they are not the national side but Calais of the fourth division. </p> <p>Eight days ago the Maritimes played Strasbourg of the first division in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. Calais were drawn at home, but because their ground was too small they had to play the game 65 miles away in Lens. </p> <p>Two hundred and fifty buses took the Calais fans to the game. What happened is already a French legend. Strasbourg scored first but Calais won 2-1 after the sports social worker Christophe Hogard equalised on his twenty-fifth birthday, and Strasbourg's keeper joined in the spirit of things by letting a free-kick from shopworker Jocelyn Merlen drop through his hands. </p> <p>'They have sauerkraut, but we have tripes!' a Calais supporter is said to have cheered. So a club that stands eighth in the fourth division, that only trains in the evenings, today finds itself in the draw for the semi-finals. No fourth-division side has ever progressed this far. </p> <p>Of all the world's nations, the French are best equipped to ponder the meaning of such an event. Ladislas Lozano, the Calais coach, named after a Hungarian uncle killed in the Spanish civil war, fought back tears as he said: 'I dedicated our victory over Cannes to all the educators of the North. I dedicate this victory over Strasbourg to my parents. It's the most beautiful day of my life.' </p> <p>He was only just warming up. </p> <p>'We have written an immensely beautiful page in the history of amateur football. My players do not realise this and so much the better. The last thing I will do is tell them.' </p> <p>The players did seem to have an inkling, however. Scorer Hogard said: 'I had 200 relatives and friends at the match. Words fail me.' </p> <p>Fabrice Baron, a defender, added: 'The stands of this stadium resound like cathedrals. It was fabulous.' </p> <p>And from Mickael Gerard, a striker who sells alcohol to English day-trippers in a local cash-and-carry: 'I carry a photo of my children in my tracksuit and look at it every half-time.' </p> <p>Returning to Calais after the match the players were welcomed by a chorus of trumpets and thousands of people. To the local burghers, this cup run is something of a French version of The Full Monty . With heavy industry dying, about 20 per cent of them have no job, and in the neighbourhood around the Calais stadium the proportion rises to 40 per cent. Last season the club lost about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>The players, most of whom normally receive no pay at all, need this cup run. When they beat Cannes of the second division each man received a bonus of \u00a32,000 pounds (which for some was equivalent to three months' salary) and now a couple of them are raking it in by selling club souvenirs. </p> <p>Jean-Marie Pui-ssesseaux, the club president, says: 'If we are knocked out in the semi-final, we will earn at least \u00a3400,000. That allows us to see the future rosily.' </p> <p>The nation is with them. The day after the Strasbourg game, Lozano was feted on national television, and then ate at Fouquet's, the legendary restaurant on the Champs d'Elys\u00e9, where the other diners paused from their labours to give him a standing ovation. </p> <p>Gerard says: 'This is huge, but we do not plan to stop here. I have already said there will be 30,000 people from Calais in the Stade de France,and we are no longer very far away.' </p> <p>Given that the other three semi-finalists are Bordeaux, Lyon and Monaco, it is probable that Calais are facing their last match (although, of course, everyone said that before they played Strasbourg). The one thing that is certain is that they will play the semi-final in Lens: in the French Cup, any team playing a side two divisions above them receive home advantage. Tens of thousands of their fellow citizens will be there, and perhaps even a few English alcohol-buying tourists. </p> <p>Outside J.L. Carr's novel How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won The FA Cup , it is hard now to imagine such a cup run happening in England. The equivalent would be Dover Athletic reaching the FA Cup semi-finals. In fact, until a few years ago, Dover and Calais played an annual fixture that was pretty evenly matched. </p> <p>But quite soon Dover might emulate Calais. To the big English clubs, the FA Cup has become a waste of time. Any team unlucky enough to win it must endure the embarrassment of playing in the Uefa Cup. So they will increasingly find excuses to drop out (tournament in Brazil, my aunt's sick, etc) or start fielding their under-14 teams. </p> <p>The future could be Calais. Anyone wanting to watch them in action soon could go across for their tricky fourth-division away match at L'Hopital on Tuesday. Kick-off is at 5.30pm. Tickets are still available.</p>",

Calais were drawn at home, but because their ground was too small they had to play the game 65 miles away in Lens. Two hundred and fifty buses took the Calais fans to the game. What happened is already a French legend. Strasbourg scored first but Calais won 2-1 after the sports social worker Christophe Hogard equalised on his twenty-fifth birthday, and Strasbourg's keeper joined in the spirit of things by letting a free-kick from shopworker Jocelyn Merlen drop through his hands. 'They have sauerkraut, but we have tripes!' a Calais supporter is said to have cheered. So a club that stands eighth in the fourth division, that only trains in the evenings, today finds itself in the draw for the semi-finals. No fourth-division side has ever progressed this far. Of all the world's nations, the French are best equipped to ponder the meaning of such an event. Ladislas Lozano, the Calais coach, named after a Hungarian uncle killed in the Spanish civil war, fought back tears as he said: 'I dedicated our victory over Cannes to all the educators of the North. I dedicate this victory over Strasbourg to my parents. It's the most beautiful day of my life.' He was only just warming up. 'We have written an immensely beautiful page in the history of amateur football. My players do not realise this and so much the better. The last thing I will do is tell them.' The players did seem to have an inkling, however. Scorer Hogard said: 'I had 200 relatives and friends at the match. Words fail me.' Fabrice Baron, a defender, added: 'The stands of this stadium resound like cathedrals. It was fabulous.' And from Mickael Gerard, a striker who sells alcohol to English day-trippers in a local cash-and-carry: 'I carry a photo of my children in my tracksuit and look at it every half-time.' Returning to Calais after the match the players were welcomed by a chorus of trumpets and thousands of people. To the local burghers, this cup run is something of a French version of The Full Monty . With heavy industry dying, about 20 per cent of them have no job, and in the neighbourhood around the Calais stadium the proportion rises to 40 per cent. Last season the club lost about \u00a3200,000. The players, most of whom normally receive no pay at all, need this cup run. When they beat Cannes of the second division each man received a bonus of \u00a32,000 pounds (which for some was equivalent to three months' salary) and now a couple of them are raking it in by selling club souvenirs. Jean-Marie Pui-ssesseaux, the club president, says: 'If we are knocked out in the semi-final, we will earn at least \u00a3400,000. That allows us to see the future rosily.' The nation is with them. The day after the Strasbourg game, Lozano was feted on national television, and then ate at Fouquet's, the legendary restaurant on the Champs d'Elys\u00e9, where the other diners paused from their labours to give him a standing ovation. Gerard says: 'This is huge, but we do not plan to stop here. I have already said there will be 30,000 people from Calais in the Stade de France,and we are no longer very far away.' Given that the other three semi-finalists are Bordeaux, Lyon and Monaco, it is probable that Calais are facing their last match (although, of course, everyone said that before they played Strasbourg). The one thing that is certain is that they will play the semi-final in Lens: in the French Cup, any team playing a side two divisions above them receive home advantage. Tens of thousands of their fellow citizens will be there, and perhaps even a few English alcohol-buying tourists. Outside J.L. Carr's novel How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won The FA Cup , it is hard now to imagine such a cup run happening in England. The equivalent would be Dover Athletic reaching the FA Cup semi-finals. In fact, until a few years ago, Dover and Calais played an annual fixture that was pretty evenly matched. But quite soon Dover might emulate Calais. To the big English clubs, the FA Cup has become a waste of time. Any team unlucky enough to win it must endure the embarrassment of playing in the Uefa Cup. So they will increasingly find excuses to drop out (tournament in Brazil, my aunt's sick, etc) or start fielding their under-14 teams. The future could be Calais. Anyone wanting to watch them in action soon could go across for their tricky fourth-division away match at L'Hopital on Tuesday. Kick-off is at 5.30pm. Tickets are still available.",

This desperate wheeze was for so-called city academies, which will operate outside the control of local education authorities and free of the Government's own curriculum and employment controls. </p> <p>Although Blunkett made no mention that for-profit operators would run the academies, the National Union of Teachers smelt a rat. But I smelt Benno Schmidt. </p> <p>Dr Schmidt is president of New York-based Edison Schools, the biggest, hottest corporation hoping to cash in on calls from US Republicans for the privatisation of America's state-funded schools. It is bankrolled by Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen. </p> <p>Blunkett's description of the city academies sounded suspiciously close to a profile of Edison's controversial 'charter schools', so I called Edison's headquarters. The company confirmed that a few weeks ago, Edison hosted a delegation from Blunkett's Department for Education and Employment. And Schmidt himself told me that this was only one of several exploratory approaches he has made to the DfEE since New Labour came to power. (Once I mentioned the Edison connection to the DfEE, a spokesman would say only that it welcomed the firm's participation.) </p> <p>A potential new market in Britain could be ideal for Edison, which is not going through the best of times. Despite the Microsoftian connection and the stock market fever over company flotations, an initial offering of Edison shares last November at $18 each saw the price crumple to $12, though it was up to around $20 last week. </p> <p>Part of the reason for Edison's falling share price was an announcement by Nasdaq, the over-the-counter market, that Tesseract, once known as Educational Alternatives (EAI), would be de-listed for failing to meet Nasdaq's minimal tangible assets requirements. EAI was the pioneer of US schools privatisation, and Edison must have hoped that memories of it would be dead. </p> <p>Before Blunkett turns his press releases into the bricks and mortar of new schools, he might want to check the reasons for the death of America's initial experience of schools privatisation. </p> <p>EAI became a stock market sensation and neo-liberal icon in 1992 when its founder, copying machine salesman John Goole, schmoozed the city of Baltimore into turning over nine schools to his company. EAI promised that, using no more cash than the city would spend, it would improve the pupils' test results. </p> <p>It did so. However, reporters at the Baltimore Sun exposed the test results as inflated. In truth, EAI students scored less well than a matched control group. The company was sacked before the end of its five-year contract. </p> <p>But by then, EAI had already convinced the city of Hartford, Connecticut, to turn over the running of its entire school system to the company. (Hartford has roughly the size and demographics of the Islington school system, which the DfEE will this month place in the hands of a private consultancy.) In Connecticut, EAI promised building repairs, better test scores, cash savings and lots of school computers. </p> <p>The scheme collapsed in little more than a year following allegations of financial impropriety and educational failure. </p> <p>EAI's high-profile belly-flop appeared to kill off the privatisation of US schools. But the dream of educating for a profit lived on with Republican candidates and bankers hungry for a piece of the $350 billion US education market. </p> <p>In 1995, in stepped Edison, announcing its takeover of two schools in Sherman, Texas. Today, Edison's sales pitch rests on a claim that it has raised pupils' test scores by '5 per cent'. </p> <p>What do the experts say? Not much, because some are afraid to speak. The Observer has learnt that the one big independent study, by the respected American Institutes for Research, removed its analysis of the Edison schools in response to a perceived threat of legal action by the company. </p> <p>The institutes' chief researcher on the project, Dr Rebecca Herman, confirmed the Edison material was excised from her report following a complaint by the company. Asked whether this decision was a response to threats of legal action, she said: 'I promised the lawyers I would not talk about that.' </p> <p>The institutes' unpublished findings, you will not be surprised to learn, are less than glowing about Edison's performance. Company president Schmidt says he 'knows nothing' about the alleged strong-arming of the institutes. He told me that this body should not have dared to evaluate his company. 'Honest education researchers would say you need at least five years of data' to assess performance, and Edison has run only four schools for that long. </p> <p>I wondered whether Schmidt was accusing his own company's researchers of dishonesty for selling school boards on its '5 per cent gain' reports. He downplayed the company's own claims of success but was 'very confident of the long-term outcomes'. </p> <p>Dr Sam Stringfield of the Johns Hopkins University Center for the Social Organization of Schools is less sanguine about Edison's forcing the institutes to censor its report. 'It is ethically troubling when a group of educators won't allow scrutiny of its methods and falls back on courts' to stifle a review. </p> <p>Schmidt says profit motivates his company to succeed. Profit also motivates Edison to find 'savings' that could, say some educationists, cost children dearly. In 1997, the US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights heavily fined Edison for failing to provide legally required classroom help for a disabled child. </p> <p>This month, facing its first contract's renewal, Edison withdrew from the schools at Sherman, Texas, rather than face banishment. </p> <p>The city's school superintendent said that, while Edison promises to educate kids for the same cost per pupil as the public system, taxpayers ended up forking out an added $4 million to subsidise Edison's operation. Worse, the test scores of pupils in Edison's schools fell behind those of the others in the area. </p> <p>'They were more about money than teaching,' said the official, Phillip Garrett. </p> <p>Schmidt, however, says Garrett misread the data, and the company was happy to dump Sherman, having lost millions on the venture. </p> <p>And that's the nub of it. Despite Paul Allen's piggy bank and miles of journalists' ink spilt in its cause, Edison remains a blip on the scene, controlling only about 60 schools, and a major money-loser. The problem is that the privateer hangs itself with its own promise to provide better educational outcomes at no extra cost. </p> <p>Underpinning the privatisation game is the nostrum that: 'You can't cure a school's problems by throwing money at it.' This diseased notion has floated over from America's rancid right, and an outbreak of educational 'free lunchism' has infected Islington, where Blunkett has forced the borough to turn over the direction of its schools to private consultants who have promised to radically improve schools without extra money. </p> <p>The affable Derek Foreman, operations director of Cambridge Educational Associates, the Islington consultants, told me that CEA's solution is 'leadership' and 'vision' and, of course, 'computers'. And, in light of the crying need to obtain and retain better staff, it will pay higher salaries - to CEA consultants. 'I'm not ashamed to say money matters in hiring good staff,' said Foreman. </p> <p>But this shameless truth, he added, does not apply to teachers. There will be no higher salaries to attract and retain good instructors. Blunkett would not permit that. Teachers will be motivated by the Torquemada system of educational reform. </p> <p>When the failing George Orwell school in Islington was transformed into the failing Arts and Media school, all but six teachers were cast out by DfEE inquisitors. Under CEA's contract to operate Islington schools, the firm can receive a bonus of up to \u00a3600,000 a year if test scores improve. </p> <p>Thus, the message to those working in these tough schools is: 'If you perform poorly, you lose your job, and we smear your professional reputation. But if you perform well, the consultants get a bonus.' What teacher could turn down such an offer? </p> <p>One man who might turn down Blunkett's offers is, surprisingly, Edison's Schmidt. Though he personally favours forming an Edison UK, and he is flattered by New Labour's ill-disguised infatuation with Edison's profit-motivated methods, his investors have reservations. Because Edison contracts to take no more money per pupil than governments spend, it refuses to operate in US states which notoriously underfund education, such as Louisiana (where, in Randy Newman's song, 'Our Boys go in Dumb, Come out Dumb too'). There's little room for profit in the UK, Schmidt notes, so long as Britain's annual spending of \u00a32,000 per pupil remains 25 per cent below that of the poorest US swampland districts. </p> <p>The Government could, of course, raise spending to Louisiana levels, but it pleads that resources are limited. How interesting that poverty should be the excuse for Blunkett's educational failure. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

She's expecting a baby in April, prompting a screen hiatus, but she'll return. For Ken's sake, let's hope so.",

      "body": "<p>Referees who have quit the game in disgust at rising levels of abuse and intimidation will be promised extra cash and better behaviour by players in a new initiative to tempt them back. Football's rulers, shaken by the huge exodus of disillusioned officials, are planning a recruitment drive to find thousands of extra whistlers to stop matches being played without someone keeping order. </p> <p>Restoring referees' authority has been identified as an urgent priority by the Football Foundation, a new body being launched next month to channel \u00a350 million a year into the game's grassroots. It will provide money to 'top up' the meagre match fees - often as little as \u00a315 and with no travel expenses - paid to referees. It will also fund training and education programmes to help match officials better discharge their responsibilities. </p> <p>The Foundation's backers - the FA, Premier League, the Government and English sports council - believe tackling the growing shortage of referees is vital to their planned rejuvenation of football's lowest levels. An advertising campaign to 'sell' the idea of refereeing as important and honourable is planned to boost the profile of the men in the middle. 'We have to turn refereeing into what marketing people would call \"a more attractive product\",' explained a Foundation source. </p> <p>Extending the FA's ongoing crackdown on misbehaviour in professional football down to pub, park and Sunday levels should make referees' lives easier too. 'The difficulty of finding a ref to take control of a match is the single biggest problem facing football's grassroots, apart from the poor quality of pitches.' The Football Foundation is a groundbreaking partnership between four organisations that often operate in a climate of mutual suspicion. Their alliance represents a belated recognition that, if the national sport is to prosper and England regain their long-lost standing worldwide, everyone with real influence must work together. Its launch, in mid-April, will kick-start an era of unprecedented investment in the unglamorous parts of the game rarely visited by Sky's cameras. The new body will plough millions into improving the chronic state of so many grass and artificial surfaces. </p> <p>'If we're going to make kids want to get out of bed early on a Saturday morning to play football, and encourage participation generally, there must be changing rooms with locks on the doors, showers with hot and cold running water and pitches that aren't covered in dog mess. We'll pay for those to be built and looked after,' said one of the Foundation's creators. </p> <p>The Premier League will donate five per cent of its deal with Sky to the Foundation. The Government will match pound-for-pound whatever sum the top flight puts in. The FA and Sport England will also contribute several million each. That should give a total pot of around \u00a325m in the financial year starting on 6 April and perhaps \u00a360m a year from 2001. </p> <p>The Foundation will build on the work of the Football Trust which, since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and Taylor Report, has channelled \u00a3300 million into an all-seat stadium revolution that has left British grounds the envy of the world. But as Trust chairman Tom Pendry MP writes in its latest annual report, it is time for new challenges. While the Foundation will still monitor ground safety, its other two decision-making panels - dealing with grassroots football and clubs' role in their local communities - reveal its real priorities. Mini-soccer, the hoped-for salvation of the English game; developing education centres at league clubs to encourage learning; women's football; and, crucially, giving youngsters the basic skills to ensure Joe Cole proves to be a trailblazer and not a one-off. </p> <p>* Copies of the Trust's annual report are available free from 1 Waterhouse Square, 138-142 Holborn, London EC1N 2ST. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Referees who have quit the game in disgust at rising levels of abuse and intimidation will be promised extra cash and better behaviour by players in a new initiative to tempt them back. Football's rulers, shaken by the huge exodus of disillusioned officials, are planning a recruitment drive to find thousands of extra whistlers to stop matches being played without someone keeping order. Restoring referees' authority has been identified as an urgent priority by the Football Foundation, a new body being launched next month to channel \u00a350 million a year into the game's grassroots. It will provide money to 'top up' the meagre match fees - often as little as \u00a315 and with no travel expenses - paid to referees. It will also fund training and education programmes to help match officials better discharge their responsibilities. The Foundation's backers - the FA, Premier League, the Government and English sports council - believe tackling the growing shortage of referees is vital to their planned rejuvenation of football's lowest levels. An advertising campaign to 'sell' the idea of refereeing as important and honourable is planned to boost the profile of the men in the middle. 'We have to turn refereeing into what marketing people would call \"a more attractive product\",' explained a Foundation source. Extending the FA's ongoing crackdown on misbehaviour in professional football down to pub, park and Sunday levels should make referees' lives easier too. 'The difficulty of finding a ref to take control of a match is the single biggest problem facing football's grassroots, apart from the poor quality of pitches.' The Football Foundation is a groundbreaking partnership between four organisations that often operate in a climate of mutual suspicion. Their alliance represents a belated recognition that, if the national sport is to prosper and England regain their long-lost standing worldwide, everyone with real influence must work together. Its launch, in mid-April, will kick-start an era of unprecedented investment in the unglamorous parts of the game rarely visited by Sky's cameras. The new body will plough millions into improving the chronic state of so many grass and artificial surfaces. 'If we're going to make kids want to get out of bed early on a Saturday morning to play football, and encourage participation generally, there must be changing rooms with locks on the doors, showers with hot and cold running water and pitches that aren't covered in dog mess. We'll pay for those to be built and looked after,' said one of the Foundation's creators. The Premier League will donate five per cent of its deal with Sky to the Foundation. The Government will match pound-for-pound whatever sum the top flight puts in. The FA and Sport England will also contribute several million each. That should give a total pot of around \u00a325m in the financial year starting on 6 April and perhaps \u00a360m a year from 2001. The Foundation will build on the work of the Football Trust which, since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and Taylor Report, has channelled \u00a3300 million into an all-seat stadium revolution that has left British grounds the envy of the world. But as Trust chairman Tom Pendry MP writes in its latest annual report, it is time for new challenges. While the Foundation will still monitor ground safety, its other two decision-making panels - dealing with grassroots football and clubs' role in their local communities - reveal its real priorities. Mini-soccer, the hoped-for salvation of the English game; developing education centres at league clubs to encourage learning; women's football; and, crucially, giving youngsters the basic skills to ensure Joe Cole proves to be a trailblazer and not a one-off. * Copies of the Trust's annual report are available free from 1 Waterhouse Square, 138-142 Holborn, London EC1N 2ST.",

The mixture of the country's paranoia over China, its international isolation and its determination to be self-reliant has driven its people to create one of the world's most successful economies.

For instance, bananas are a symbol of melancholy and used to be planted in a garden by a wife whose husband spent too much time in court.

Nowadays, the Lantern Festival brings the New Year season to a close and is the big day for children. Everywhere children are assembling plastic dragons lighted by battery-powered bulbs ready for a night of glowing festivity.</p> <p>In Taipei, huge crowds congregate at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial - an enormous walled compound with a large garden at its centre and the National Concert Hall on one side and the National Theatre on the other. Both buildings are splendid examples of traditional Chinese architecture, and during the festival they put on a four-hour show of traditional drumming, dragon dancing and acrobatics.</p> <p>At the far end of the square is the white-marble memorial hall which houses a colossal statue of Chiang Kai-shek, who died in 1975.

      "body": "<p>In 1929, United Artists released a film version of The Taming of the Shrew, starring Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, which has long been regarded as boasting one of the worst credit lines in movie history. After mentioning the involvement of some obscure chap called William Shakespeare, it announced: 'With additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.' </p> <p>In his latest film, Love's Labour's Lost, Kenneth Branagh does not go so far as to give a screenwriting credit to the movie's co-writers, but it's fair to say that they are rather more deserving of recognition than Mr Taylor. 'With additional dialogue by Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and Gershwin' does have a certain ring to it. </p> <p>Resetting the romantic geometry of Love's Labour's Lost in the Oxbridge of the Thirties, and replacing sections of the ornate text with musical numbers like 'Cheek to Cheek' and 'I Get a Kick Out of You' is a classic Branagh gambit. Not only does it lay down an obvious challenge to those who regard Shakespeare's words as inviolable, but it also raises more complex questions about whether it is possible, in this more cynical age, to make a film musical that does not just give the nod to Hollywood's great all-singing all-dancing productions, but lovingly embraces them. </p> <p>For his part, Branagh makes no excuses; the approach arose solely from the text. 'When I played Love's Labour's Lost in the theatre, it always reminded me of the silly, charming mood that you get with those old Hollywood musicals,' he says. 'And the text constantly refers to song and dance.' But, he says, the language of the play - one of the least performed Shakespeares - can be so dense that it excludes as many as it draws in. He concluded that lyricists like Porter and Ira Gershwin could give Will a helping hand. 'It was a strangely organic process of cutting the play first and then scanning the text for references,' Branagh says. 'I was always looking for songs that moved the plot on. You try to find the dramatic impulse.' </p> <p>And so, when one amorous courtier describes how: 'When love speaks, the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony', his next words are the first lines from Irving Berlin's 'Cheek to Cheek': 'Heaven, I'm in heaven...' It could be desperately cheesy and many may still find it so, but those who hold an affection for Hollywood musicals will surely get the idea. You do not so much have to suspend your disbelief as chuck it away altogether. </p> <p>If the film succeeds, it is because it makes not a single compromise. True, some of the actors, including Alicia Silverstone, Richard Briers and Branagh himself, are clearly rather less than accomplished musical performers, but their contributions are carefully tailored to their talents. In any case, there are more seasoned song and dance men like Nathan Lane and Adrian Lester on hand to deliver the goods. </p> <p>There are top hats. There are tails. There are kick lines. There is even a rendition of 'No Business Like Showbusiness'. OK, it isn't exactly Metro Goldwyn Meyer and Arthur Freed, but it is more than just a casual stab at hommage. </p> <p>The job of arranging the songs fell to Oscar-nominated composer Pat Doyle, who has worked with Branagh on all his other Shakespeare films. </p> <p>'As a music student, I played piano in bars and I was required to play these songs,' he says. 'So I knew them very well. I also adore the work of Irving Berlin. What I was intrigued to see was how they would sit with Shakespeare. Eventually, I came to see them almost as arias, there to heighten the action.' </p> <p>Initially, Branagh toyed with the idea of commissioning brand new songs in the style of Porter and Berlin. 'I'm glad that didn't happen,' Doyle says. 'That would have been a bit risky, a bit cheeky. It would have needed serious courage.' </p> <p>Eventually, not only did they plump for a set of 10 cast-iron standards, but the lush arrangements were, if not exactly conventional, then at least true to the age in which they were first written and performed. 'Our first instinct was to be slightly restrained and use a smaller ensemble rather than a symphonic orchestra and that, by its nature, would have given a more contemporary feel to the music,' Doyle says. 'But then we realised it needed bigness to match the scale of the image. I think my job was to make the narrative accessible through the musical numbers and to put these songs on the plinth they deserve.' </p> <p>Only one arrangement, 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', which is used in a mass courtship scene, veers away from the traditional into a more modern bump and grind of jungle drums and brass. 'It was always the drama that dictated what would go on in the music,' Doyle says. 'The moment we saw the choreography for \"Let's Face the Music\", we could see that was the way it had to go.' </p> <p>As to the question over the continuing viability of the film musical, that, to all intents and purposes, remains unanswered. It is such an idiosyncratic work, such an original piece, that it tells us little or nothing about the genre. All that can be said is that, of all the Shakespeare movie adaptations set in Thirties Britain and using the songs of Gershwin and Porter, this is undoubtedly one of the best. </p> <p>\u0095 Love's Labour's Lost opens on Friday</p>",

In any case, there are more seasoned song and dance men like Nathan Lane and Adrian Lester on hand to deliver the goods. There are top hats. There are tails. There are kick lines. There is even a rendition of 'No Business Like Showbusiness'. OK, it isn't exactly Metro Goldwyn Meyer and Arthur Freed, but it is more than just a casual stab at hommage. The job of arranging the songs fell to Oscar-nominated composer Pat Doyle, who has worked with Branagh on all his other Shakespeare films. 'As a music student, I played piano in bars and I was required to play these songs,' he says. 'So I knew them very well. I also adore the work of Irving Berlin. What I was intrigued to see was how they would sit with Shakespeare. Eventually, I came to see them almost as arias, there to heighten the action.' Initially, Branagh toyed with the idea of commissioning brand new songs in the style of Porter and Berlin. 'I'm glad that didn't happen,' Doyle says. 'That would have been a bit risky, a bit cheeky. It would have needed serious courage.' Eventually, not only did they plump for a set of 10 cast-iron standards, but the lush arrangements were, if not exactly conventional, then at least true to the age in which they were first written and performed. 'Our first instinct was to be slightly restrained and use a smaller ensemble rather than a symphonic orchestra and that, by its nature, would have given a more contemporary feel to the music,' Doyle says. 'But then we realised it needed bigness to match the scale of the image. I think my job was to make the narrative accessible through the musical numbers and to put these songs on the plinth they deserve.' Only one arrangement, 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', which is used in a mass courtship scene, veers away from the traditional into a more modern bump and grind of jungle drums and brass. 'It was always the drama that dictated what would go on in the music,' Doyle says. 'The moment we saw the choreography for \"Let's Face the Music\", we could see that was the way it had to go.' As to the question over the continuing viability of the film musical, that, to all intents and purposes, remains unanswered. It is such an idiosyncratic work, such an original piece, that it tells us little or nothing about the genre. All that can be said is that, of all the Shakespeare movie adaptations set in Thirties Britain and using the songs of Gershwin and Porter, this is undoubtedly one of the best. \u0095 Love's Labour's Lost opens on Friday",

      "body": "<p>Fritillaries sound like nothing else on earth and now, damn her, I can never see one or hear it named without thinking of the bag lady of Finchley and Michael Palin. 'He's frit,' crowed 'Lady' Thatcher in one of her more lucid moments, aiming her remark at the much-maligned Neil Kinnock. I am still not sure if it was a result of her increasingly Gormenghastian dentistry that made her mispronounce 'He's fit!' (Whoar, you can see her thinking, I could fancy some of that. A bit far-fetched, I admit, but a delicious thought) or whether she was just thinking floral and the word fritillary burst unbidden to her lips only to be nipped in the bud. We shall probably never know, but that's the wonderful world of gardening for you, rich with imponderables. </p> <p>And, if you are lucky, rich with fritillaries. Rich is the right word. The common snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, is as opulent as a harem - chequered stained-glass petals hunkered over spangled light. No snake's head was ever so beautiful, although they do have a kind of sinister, reptilian quality, especially before they open out, the pointed flowerhead hooked over from the straight stem with its evenly and sparsely spaced leaves - hardly more than thin green grooves. Look at the chequered petals closely and you will see how they are a perfect combination of blocked precision and smudged expressionism - perfect because it is not predictable or measurable. Each flower head its own. I like their folk name of Sulky Ladies - it exactly catches their pouty appeal. </p> <p>It is a bulbous wildflower (although perhaps a garden escapee - the first record of them as a wildflower postdates their record as a garden plant by 50 years) found in wet meadows and until the 1930s it grew freely in 27 English counties, although now it is reduced to about two dozen individual fields across only nine southern counties. This reduction is mainly because, although a wildflower, it is dependant on a rhythm of agriculture that has largely vanished. It thrives in wet meadows that are allowed to grow for hay under the Lammas land regime. The meadows are cut and harvested between 1 July and 12 August (Lammas) and then grazed until 12 February. This exactly dovetails with the fritillary's growth pattern. The bulb goes dormant after June until August when it grows new shoots that stop just below the surface and also go dormant in response to cooler night temperatures. As soon as the weather warms up in spring, they start to grow fast from this poised position so that they can flower and set seed before the grass gets growing. Man and flowers rubbing along fine. </p> <p>Cowslips spread in the wild under an identical regime in dry, limestone meadows. Call me an old hippie, but given the nature of our agriculture, a harvest of Sulky Ladies or cowslips for people to walk around and enjoy before the hay harvest seems to me a better use of land than chemically forced junk-grass respected only as part of the process of making a hamburger. But the lesson should be heeded for the garden. Snake's head are best planted in wet ground with gentle summer shade, although I saw a very happy little colony beneath a Kilmarnock willow in a garden whose soil seemed to be pure sand. Winter wet is the key and it is wonderful what a hosepipe can do to mimic rain. They should seed themselves and spread to establish a colony if, like the meadow grass, they do not have to compete as they establish. They can be planted as bulbs in August or in flower now. I bought and planted three dozen, including about 10 white-flowering ones, on 10 April last year, which was right at the end of their flowering period. They all seem to be coming up fine this year. </p> <p>A new book by Rod Leeds, The Plantfinder's Guide to Early Bulbs (David &amp; Charles, \u00a319.99), is geared towards the keen bulb grower rather than the general gardener, and is generally heavy on botany and horticulture and light on inspirational anecdote, but has the following wonderful image: 'On a sunny day, the bulb frames [note the plural] containing fritillaries will draw queen wasps...which fertilise the plants...These insects seem to be the main pollinators of the early fritillaries...' What an amazing fact! What an added texture of opulence that adds to the plant! </p> <p>Although they are the best known, snake's head fritillaries are by no means the only ones. There are more than a hundred different species of this member of the lily family. The only other one we grow is the crown imperial, F imperialis, which is quite another beast altogether, and is just coming into flower now. With a tuft of shiny green punk-leaf seemingly growing out of the middle of the circlet of hanging orange-yellow bell flowers, growing on a thick stem 1m high, it is as stridently in-your-face as the snake's head is shyly beautiful. It stinks of tomcat, too. In fact, the bulbs - great squashed things - smell almost poisonous in an acrid, chemical way. You plant the bulbs on their side, the pointed end horizontal to the ground. We have F imperialis 'Lutea' in pots, which has clear yellow flowers, and orange ones in the jewel garden. I like the look of 'Rubra' with its almost helleborean flowers. At the moment there are three in the spring garden where they are rather louche against all the rest of the seasonal subtlety. I think that this year I shall dig them up (always a good idea every three years or so anyway, to replant them with more organic material under them so that they flower with noticeably extra vigour) and put them into pots. They are really a specimen plant to be enjoyed as a freak show and then tucked away to bake over the summer and be repotted in the autumn. Thinking about it, all fritillaries look good in pots, just as increasingly I like all 'wild' or naturalised flowers in pots. Even if you only have a tiny space, this is a really good way to get touches of the water meadows, woods and hills into your back garden. </p> <p>If you want to grow a muscular, bunched kind of fritillary rather than enjoying the delicacy of so many of the species, then I think that F camschatcensis is a much more handsome plant than the crown imperial. It comes from the other side of the world (the crown imperial is from Turkey, whereas F camschatcensis is from the Pacific Rim). It will grow best in damp shade (but not too shady) and in June has a deep purple, almost brown, cluster of flowers borne on a strong 18in stem. The bulbs are made up of dry scales, so are fragile to handle, but probably worth the trouble. I shall try it. </p> <p>I like the look of F pyrenaica, which has yellow flowers washed over heavily with burgundy/purple. The edges of the petals are turned up, revealing a golden interior as the light streams through the thin flower walls, and that tiny detail is enough to replace all the languid menace of the snake's head with charm. It comes from the Pyrenees and therefore needs more sunlight than F meleagris, but is easy to grow and will form clumps. The only drawback seems to be that it does not come true from seed, the seedlings being rather paler than the parent. Does that matter? Perhaps. </p> <p> F michailovskyi is another fritillary with the combination of purplish-brown outsides and bright yellow interiors bleeding out at the tips of the petals. Apparently, this was considered a rare and elusive bulb until recently, when new propagation techniques have made it as common as muck - and none the less attractive for that. It is best grown in troughs. </p> <p> F orientalis is a good tone darker, without the bonnet-like flicked-up rims. I really like the look of them, although I am slightly perturbed by Bill Chudziak's caution in the excellent Bloom (Channel 4 books/Collins &amp; Brown, \u00a320): 'Fanatics might enjoy the challenge of... F orientalis, ' whereas Rod Leeds merely comments that 'this is a good garden plant that will thrive in semi-shaded positions in the open ground.' Perhaps he is a frit fanatic anyway. </p> <p>Which brings me back to Michael Palin. How does he fit in the frits? Unfortunately for him, he is inextricably yoked to Lady T in my mind. I was at one of those terrible showbiz award lunches where Palin was given some kind of lifetime, awfully-good-chap award. Lady milk-snatcher was wheeled on to read the nominations and weirdly announced the winner to be 'Michael Par-lin', thereby spurring the mispronounced comic into a wonderfully funny acceptance speech entirely at Lady T's expense. Tears of joy ran down the audience's cheeks and, best of all, the old girl stood by his side throughout, oblivious to any part of the joke. </p> <p><strong> Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong> <br> Observer readers can reserve their Fritillaria snake's head bulbs (100 + 50 free) for August delivery.

      "body": "<p>In 1967, Sydney Poitier was riding high. The first big black star in Hollywood, he appeared that year in three hit movies - In the Heat of the Night (which won Oscar for best film), Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? and To Sir With Love, in each playing a saintly black, morally and intellectually superior to the white folk around him. </p> <p>It really seemed as if a radical transformation was taking place in the American public's attitude towards racial matters. However, that same year Mohammed Ali, the greatest boxer who ever lived, was publicly humiliated and stripped of his heavyweight title for refusing on grounds of conscience to be drafted for military service. </p> <p>And even more appallingly, a less well-known prizefighter, the black middleweight Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, was framed for the triple murder of three whites in a Paterson, New Jersey bar and given three consecutive life sentences. </p> <p>Norman Jewison, whose reputation as a serious moviemaker still largely rests on In the Heat of the Night, has now tackled the story of Rubin Carter in The Hurricane. And, inevitably, he has cast in the central role Poitier's natural successor, Denzel Washington, an imposing actor whose career has been largely devoted to playing noble blacks, including a Christ-like Steve Biko in Cry Freedom, the eponymous hero of Malcolm X, and a benevolent angel in The Preacher's Wife. </p> <p>Because Carter was eventually freed after 20 years in jail, the tale can be given a happy, upbeat ending and indeed the movie is presented as doubly inspirational through the parallel stories it tells. </p> <p>It goes without saying that Carter's case is a compelling one that arouses a proper indignation in everyone who reads of it or hears of it through Bob Dylan's classic song 'Hurricane'. But the movie seems to me disappointing in almost every respect other than in its technical proficiency. </p> <p> The Hurricane unfolds out of sequence in an elaborate series of flashbacks, covering events from Carter's first stretch in reform school for defending himself against a white, middle-class paedophile at the age of 10, up to his release from jail in 1985 at the age of 50. </p> <p>But within the first 15 minutes, we hear of the bestselling memoir, The Sixteenth Round, that he wrote in 1974, which showed his spiritual transformation from hard man to philosopher. 'Writing is a weapon more powerful than any fist,' he says in the movie. </p> <p>This has the effect of putting the transformed, mature, pacific Carter in the foreground almost from the start. But it's necessary to the screenwriter's strategy because it introduces the second strand of the narrative - the accidental discovery in 1981 of a secondhand copy of Carter's book by Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a black teenager who has been rescued from the Brooklyn ghetto and is being reared in Toronto by a curious trio of white Canadian philanthropists (John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber). </p> <p>Lesra's black consciousness and academic ambitions are raised by the book; he corresponds with Carter and becomes a surrogate son. Consequently, the lad's Canadian guardians devote themselves to re-investigating the case and freeing the boxer. How closely the film corresponds to the facts I don't know (though it omits the events of 1976 when Carter and the man convicted with him were released on bail for nine months before a second trial). </p> <p>But The Hurricane is deeply sentimental and bursting with liberal platitudes. The three Canadians are a smug, superior, self-congratulatory bunch, forever swapping conspiratorial glances that acknowledge a shared sensitivity. </p> <p>Can their fellow Canadian Norman Jewison really intend them as representatives of a superior culture coming from across the 49th Parallel to free the saintly Hurricane from the clutches of his American persecutors? </p> <p>The movie, however, doesn't directly indict the American system. The horrors of prison life are alluded to but scarcely shown. After an initial protest, Carter is excused from work and from wearing prison clothes, and Clancy Brown, unforgettable as the sadistic chief warder in The Shawshank Redemption, has been deliberately cast as the sympathetic warder who befriends Hurricane. </p> <p>Another piece of casting intended to evoke an earlier role is the cameo performance by Rod Steiger as the wise federal judge who frees Carter, ruling that his conviction was based on 'racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure'. We naturally recall that Steiger won an Oscar as the bigoted Southern sheriff converted to liberalism by Poitier in In the Heat of the Night and is given a line that all too easily could have fitted into this movie: 'Virgil, you're a credit to your race - I mean the human race.' </p> <p>The principal means by which The Hurricane evades examining the idea of institutionalised racism and all its social implications is turning Carter's story into a New Jersey version of Les Mis\u00e9rables. From childhood onwards, Carter is the doomed Valjean to the vindictive Inspector Javert of Detective Vincent Della Pesca, an obviously fictitious New Jersey policeman who bears on his shoulders the whole weight of the criminal justice system's racism. </p> <p>Played with a saturnine menace by Dan Hedaya, Della Pesca sees it as his mission to destroy the hapless Carter. He pursues him for 40 years, threatens the Canadian intruders when they revive the case, and is finally left scowling like a frustrated villain from Victorian melodrama as a courtroom packed with jubilant supporters cheer the vindicated Carter.</p>",

The Hurricane unfolds out of sequence in an elaborate series of flashbacks, covering events from Carter's first stretch in reform school for defending himself against a white, middle-class paedophile at the age of 10, up to his release from jail in 1985 at the age of 50. But within the first 15 minutes, we hear of the bestselling memoir, The Sixteenth Round, that he wrote in 1974, which showed his spiritual transformation from hard man to philosopher. 'Writing is a weapon more powerful than any fist,' he says in the movie. This has the effect of putting the transformed, mature, pacific Carter in the foreground almost from the start. But it's necessary to the screenwriter's strategy because it introduces the second strand of the narrative - the accidental discovery in 1981 of a secondhand copy of Carter's book by Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a black teenager who has been rescued from the Brooklyn ghetto and is being reared in Toronto by a curious trio of white Canadian philanthropists (John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber). Lesra's black consciousness and academic ambitions are raised by the book; he corresponds with Carter and becomes a surrogate son. Consequently, the lad's Canadian guardians devote themselves to re-investigating the case and freeing the boxer. How closely the film corresponds to the facts I don't know (though it omits the events of 1976 when Carter and the man convicted with him were released on bail for nine months before a second trial). But The Hurricane is deeply sentimental and bursting with liberal platitudes. The three Canadians are a smug, superior, self-congratulatory bunch, forever swapping conspiratorial glances that acknowledge a shared sensitivity. Can their fellow Canadian Norman Jewison really intend them as representatives of a superior culture coming from across the 49th Parallel to free the saintly Hurricane from the clutches of his American persecutors? The movie, however, doesn't directly indict the American system. The horrors of prison life are alluded to but scarcely shown. After an initial protest, Carter is excused from work and from wearing prison clothes, and Clancy Brown, unforgettable as the sadistic chief warder in The Shawshank Redemption, has been deliberately cast as the sympathetic warder who befriends Hurricane. Another piece of casting intended to evoke an earlier role is the cameo performance by Rod Steiger as the wise federal judge who frees Carter, ruling that his conviction was based on 'racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure'. We naturally recall that Steiger won an Oscar as the bigoted Southern sheriff converted to liberalism by Poitier in In the Heat of the Night and is given a line that all too easily could have fitted into this movie: 'Virgil, you're a credit to your race - I mean the human race.' The principal means by which The Hurricane evades examining the idea of institutionalised racism and all its social implications is turning Carter's story into a New Jersey version of Les Mis\u00e9rables. From childhood onwards, Carter is the doomed Valjean to the vindictive Inspector Javert of Detective Vincent Della Pesca, an obviously fictitious New Jersey policeman who bears on his shoulders the whole weight of the criminal justice system's racism. Played with a saturnine menace by Dan Hedaya, Della Pesca sees it as his mission to destroy the hapless Carter. He pursues him for 40 years, threatens the Canadian intruders when they revive the case, and is finally left scowling like a frustrated villain from Victorian melodrama as a courtroom packed with jubilant supporters cheer the vindicated Carter.",

Love and Money looked at the problems that beset a Double-Income-No-Kids couple when they decide to breed and thus lose one salary, at least for a while.</p> <p> In fact, it was a statistic from Relate that had inspired the programme: according to a 1998 survey, British couples argue more about money than any other subject. George must have known he was presenting himself as a sullen, spud-faced bastard for whom greed is good but women are no better than they ought to be. 'I make the decisions round here because I earn the money'; 'You got the vote; what more do you want?'; and of his decision not to allow Karen to be signatory on their joint bank account: 'I didn't want her to get her grubby little hands on it. Spend it on shoes and cigarettes and women's fripperies.' George was fortyish. This was satire, right?</p> <p> The first in his new series, Jam, saw Chris Morris plying his compulsively dark and unlovely trade in a place somewhere just beyond satire, though it's too early to say precisely where that might be, because Jam was much closer to Morris's defunct Radio One show, Blue Jam, than to either The Day Today or Brass Eye and, indeed, only the sketch featuring the woman miming Minnie Riperton's 'Loving You' while being beaten with a Spacehopper was giggle-making; the rest was merely madly - and maddeningly - compelling.</p> <p> For when he isn't making you laugh, Morris is capable of bringing out the latent Angry of Media Vale inside almost any reasonably well-balanced viewer.</p> <p> For me, the most haunting and disturbing sketches (though it's not quite the right term for a writer and performer whose 'sketches' are more Francis Bacon than they are Morecambe and Wise) were those that recalled the dread quasi-dreamscape and loss of control that often comes with impending anaesthesia. Morris is usually described as surreal but Jam is, in its own way, very far from surreal - more like a persuasively warped commentary on a thoroughly bad-to-the-bone and threatening world we perceive to be slipping swiftly and scarily from our individual grasp.</p> <p> Anyway, I'm glad Morris is back and producing true millennial terror TV, brilliantly abusing the medium he knows best, especially given that he proved himself a disappointingly unfunny spoof newspaper columnist. So much suppurating rage, Chris - perhaps you need a dog?</p>",

Love and Money looked at the problems that beset a Double-Income-No-Kids couple when they decide to breed and thus lose one salary, at least for a while. In fact, it was a statistic from Relate that had inspired the programme: according to a 1998 survey, British couples argue more about money than any other subject. George must have known he was presenting himself as a sullen, spud-faced bastard for whom greed is good but women are no better than they ought to be. 'I make the decisions round here because I earn the money'; 'You got the vote; what more do you want?'; and of his decision not to allow Karen to be signatory on their joint bank account: 'I didn't want her to get her grubby little hands on it. Spend it on shoes and cigarettes and women's fripperies.' George was fortyish. This was satire, right? The first in his new series, Jam, saw Chris Morris plying his compulsively dark and unlovely trade in a place somewhere just beyond satire, though it's too early to say precisely where that might be, because Jam was much closer to Morris's defunct Radio One show, Blue Jam, than to either The Day Today or Brass Eye and, indeed, only the sketch featuring the woman miming Minnie Riperton's 'Loving You' while being beaten with a Spacehopper was giggle-making; the rest was merely madly - and maddeningly - compelling. For when he isn't making you laugh, Morris is capable of bringing out the latent Angry of Media Vale inside almost any reasonably well-balanced viewer. For me, the most haunting and disturbing sketches (though it's not quite the right term for a writer and performer whose 'sketches' are more Francis Bacon than they are Morecambe and Wise) were those that recalled the dread quasi-dreamscape and loss of control that often comes with impending anaesthesia. Morris is usually described as surreal but Jam is, in its own way, very far from surreal - more like a persuasively warped commentary on a thoroughly bad-to-the-bone and threatening world we perceive to be slipping swiftly and scarily from our individual grasp. Anyway, I'm glad Morris is back and producing true millennial terror TV, brilliantly abusing the medium he knows best, especially given that he proved himself a disappointingly unfunny spoof newspaper columnist. So much suppurating rage, Chris - perhaps you need a dog?",

Although she is one of the richest women in the world, with a family fortune estimated at \u00a314 billion, she always flies economy class and the only luxury she allows herself is the large BMW she drives. </p> <p>Frau Quandt's daily routine is made more agreeable by the fact that her daughter Susanne, 37, and son Stefan, 33, work in the same building and the family gets together frequently for modest meals and quiet chats. Last week, these gatherings were almost certainly dominated by the fall-out over the sale of Rover by BMW, a company in which the Quandt family owns almost half the shares. </p> <p>'The family was upset by the press reaction, particularly because so many of the claims made were untrue. We are taking legal action over some of these assertions,' the family's spokesman, Thomas Gauly, told me last week. The Quandts have never given an interview to the media ('Why should they?' asks Gauly) and they have seldom been photographed. </p> <p>But British anger over BMW's handling of the Rover sale has dragged this publicity-shy family into the limelight and allowed them to be portrayed as heartless plutocrats who are unmoved by the fate of thousands of British car workers. </p> <p>Some newspapers have even used Frau Quandt's relationship through marriage to the family of Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, to imply that the family has a secret Nazi past, a slur that chimes neatly with popular British prejudice about the Germans. </p> <p>'As prominent people, the Quandts have to put up with media attention, however unpleasant. But they remain well disposed towards Britain and the British,' Gauly insists. The row over Rover is likely to blow over soon enough and Trade Secretary Stephen Byers was eager to patch up relations with BMW when he visited their headquarters in Munich on Thursday. But the Bavarian carmakers' disastrous British venture, which has cost the company more than \u00a35bn, has raised questions about the future of BMW itself as an independent company. </p> <p>The Quandts insist that they have no intention of selling their stake in BMW and Gauly strenuously denies that the family has been engaged in secret negotiations with Ford about the sale of the company. </p> <p>'If they were to sell it, what should they do with the money? The Quandts are not venture capitalists. They don't know anything about Internet businesses. What they know about is the motor industry,' he said. </p> <p>The motor industry has certainly been good to the Quandts and the family's stake in BMW is now worth 10 times what it was in 1982 when Johanna's husband, Herbert, died. Herbert was born in 1910 into a long-established industrial family and his father, Gunther, was one of Hitler's chief economic advisors. Gunther's second wife, Magda Friedlaender, later married Goebbels and the young Herbert spent part of his youth at the propaganda minister's home. By the time war broke out, however, Herbert was already an adult and was no longer in close contact with Goebbels, who poisoned himself, his wife and their six children in Hitler's bunker in 1945. </p> <p>Much of the Quandt family business was in ruins after the war and a great part of what survived had been commandeered by the invading Soviet forces. The task of rebuilding its fortunes fell mainly to Herbert, who proved to be a highly effective businessman, saving BMW from bankruptcy in 1959 by increasing his stake in the company and unflinchingly selling the family stake in Daimler-Benz when he judged the time to be right. This sale set off a tradition of rivalry between BMW and Daimler that has continued to this day and may have contributed to the Bavarian company's present crisis. </p> <p>Johanna, who had been Herbert's secretary, became his third wife in 1960 and inherited most of his fortune, including his entire stake in BMW, on his death in 1982. Johanna was determined from the start that her two children should have as normal an upbringing as possible and when Susanne went to work at BMW, she took a job in the canteen. </p> <p>Johanna and Susanne made the news briefly and unwillingly in 1978 when a last-minute police intervention foiled an attempt to kidnap them. A 14-strong gang led by convicts on day release from the local prison had intended to snatch the two Quandts from their home in broad daylight and demand an \u00a38 million ransom. </p> <p>This experience may explain the Quandts' extreme aversion to publicity, and both Susanne and Stefan are accompanied by bodyguards at all times. According to one guest at their parties, the younger Quandts are socially reserved to an unusual degree. 'The bodyguards are always very much in evidence but what struck me as unusual is that, even when they are the hosts, the Quandts seldom circulate among guests. They just sit at their table, talking quietly among themselves while others enjoy their hospitality,' he said. </p> <p>BMW declines to give details of the extent of the family's involvement in business decisions but Susanne and Stefan sit on the advisory board and Johanna is known to have approved the decision to buy Rover in 1994. Gauly insisted last week that all negotiations surrounding the sale of Rover to the venture capital firm, Alchemy, were handled by BMW's chief executive, Professor Joachim Milberg. </p> <p>But Alchemy's boss, Jon Moulton, appeared to cast doubt on that story earlier in the week. 'The idea to buy Rover came in the autumn from Tom Sommerlatte,' he said. Mr Sommerlatte is vice-president of the management consultants, Arthur D. Little, in Wiesbaden and a member of the Alchemy board. He is also reported to have close links with the Quandt family. </p> <p>The Quandts have remained scrupulously loyal to Milberg during the past few days and Gauly told me that he expects the chief executive will still be in his post a year from now. But BMW's British adventure is being seen in German business circles as the worst case of mismanagement since Edzard Reuter's doomed attempt to turn Daimler-Benz into a technology conglomerate. </p> <p>The company most analysts believe is best placed to buy BMW is Ford, which last week snapped up Land-Rover for its luxury division, which already owns Jaguar, Volvo, Aston Martin and Lincoln. In a bitter irony for the Bavarians, this Ford division is led by Wolfgang Reitzle, a former BMW manager who left the company last year when he was passed over for the top job in favour of Milberg. </p> <p>Six years ago, Reitzle warned his colleagues that their British adventure would end in tears and predicted that Rover would cost BMW DM13 billion by 2000. His prediction, which was dismissed at the time as an absurd prophecy of doom, was inaccurate. Rover has cost BMW an estimated DM16bn. </p> <p>Instead of buying Rover, Reitzle wanted to develop a middle-of-the-range BMW 2 series, along the lines of the A Class developed by the Bavarians' rivals in Daimler-Benz (now Daimler-Chrysler). But his fellow managers argued that introducing a more downmarket model would damage the BMW brand and that the best way to expand BMW's range would be to acquire other marques. The Quandts were believed to be uneasy about acquiring Rover but they went along with the strategy of Berndt Pitschetsrieder, Milberg's predecessor, for almost six years. </p> <p>It was only when Rover's losses threatened to damage BMW's core business that the family decided that Pitschetsrieder had to go. Reitzle expected to take over as chairman last year but his appointment was blocked by trade union representatives on BMW's board, who made it clear that they would not co-operate with his plans. Milberg was chosen as a safe pair of hands but, at 61, he was widely viewed as a transitional figure whose primary task was to make Rover profitable or gracefully get rid of it. </p> <p>Gauly insisted last week that Milberg had performed the task he was given by withdrawing from Rover when it became clear that the company could not be turned around. But the cost has been enormous. The Rover 75, universally acknowledged as one of the best new cars to be produced in recent years, has turned out to be a commercial flop. The manufacturers blame the strength of the pound against the euro for the Rover 75's failure but the truth is that it has performed badly in Britain as well. </p> <p>Despite the exchange rate, Rover continued to buy 85 per cent of its components from British suppliers until last year - missing out on an estimated saving of DM2bn. By the beginning of this year, even Land-Rover was losing money and everyone at BMW realised that the condition of the English Patient - as Rover is known in Munich - had become critical. </p> <p>This did not stop the company from issuing a sharp denial of a report last month that the BMW board was considering selling Rover. At the beginning of this month, BMW executives attending a motor show in Geneva were repeating the same, confident lines about Rover's future. One German magazine was reminded of the uplifting speeches delivered by East Germany's leaders on the fortieth anniversary of their state's foundation, a few weeks before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. </p> <p>Speculation about the Quandts' intentions towards BMW focuses on Susanne and Stefan, both of whom went to business school in the United States and are less steeped in the German corporate tradition than is their mother. Gauly denies that the younger family members, both of whom run businesses outside the motor sector, are driven, like most British and American investors, by shareholder value. </p> <p>'Their ideas are closer to the stakeholder concept, whereby the value of a company is not only measured by the index but also by, for example, the question of how a company deals with its employees or how much social responsibility it undertakes,' he said. Gauly claims that the Quandts are not politically-minded but Johanna has long been friendly with the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and the family contributed almost \u00a31 million to Germany's conservative parties in the run up to the general election in 1998. </p> <p>When Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Centre-Left government came to power and Oskar Lafontaine, the former finance minister, threatened to squeeze more tax from the rich, the Quandts transferred their stake in BMW to a succession of joint-stock companies. Hans Eichel, Lafontaine's successor as finance minister, has performed a dramatic U-turn on tax and delighted big business by changing the terms under which companies can sell their stake in other firms. Until now, a decision to sell their stake in BMW would result in a massive tax bill for the Quandts, but from 1 January 2001, such a deal will be entirely tax-free. </p> <p>The Quandts have told Germany's conservatives that they can expect no more donations until they clear up the scandal surrounding Kohl's illegal funding network. And although he insists that the family will not be selling BMW 'this year or next year, either', Gauly has not ruled out future donations to Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats: 'It's too early to say.

      "body": "<p>Our man in Berlin, Ambassador Sir Paul Lever, took it upon himself last week to attack the British press for peddling anti-German propaganda. He flailed in all directions, citing the Times, the Telegraph and the Sun, moving even the Sun to deny the accusation. 'Old-fashioned, war-related jibes at the Germans are counter-productive,' it declared. </p> <p>In doing so, the Sun placed itself firmly at the supper table of the chatterers. For everyone knows, now, that scathing references to Germans are the province of the yob; that away from Millwall, here in polite society, the Germans are our friends, our allies, our European partners, that what's done is done, that there's no point in harking back because (my great favourite) it's 'not useful', so whatever you do: Don't Mention The War. </p> <p>This is a unique exemption that we afford the German people. The general rule - most especially for those of the liberal Left - is to show off the history that informs your conversation. You cannot hold views on, say, Ireland, unless you can drop with ease such dates as 1916, 1920 or, if you want to be dead flash, the rebellion of 1641. A debate on Palestinian land rights is incomplete without dragging in Balfour, and when it comes to the Balkans, wow! There are those who can play with 900 years on that one. </p> <p>The role of the British in world history informs the liberal most of all: what 'we' did to the Aborigine, to the Indian, what part 'we' played in American slavery or the ransacking of the Far East. 'We', of course, did none of it; our great-great-forefathers did. But never mind - a little conscience goes a long way and is, thus, no bad thing. </p> <p>Yet if we are to remember our great-greats, if we are to remember what William did and what Patrick did next, or how the proud Ibo was abducted from his native land and carried to the cotton fields all those years ago, then I cannot see why we are not supposed to remember what Hans's daddy did, just a blink away from yesterday. </p> <p>In fact, Don't Mention The War is usually only a euphemism; what we are really saying is Don't Mention The Holocaust. We act as if it is somehow vulgar and indelicate to refer to one of the greatest obscenities in the history of the world, particularly because it might, heaven forfend, upset Hans if we do. </p> <p>Well, tough. </p> <p>Fact One: it happened. Fact Two: it happened because a great many Germans made it happen, and a great many more let them. Fact Three: the people in power in Germany today are the first generation after; the children of those who did and those who let. And it beggars belief to suggest that their family relationships had neither influence nor effect. </p> <p>I need look no further than my own family to illustrate.

      "bodyText": "Our man in Berlin, Ambassador Sir Paul Lever, took it upon himself last week to attack the British press for peddling anti-German propaganda. He flailed in all directions, citing the Times, the Telegraph and the Sun, moving even the Sun to deny the accusation. 'Old-fashioned, war-related jibes at the Germans are counter-productive,' it declared. In doing so, the Sun placed itself firmly at the supper table of the chatterers. For everyone knows, now, that scathing references to Germans are the province of the yob; that away from Millwall, here in polite society, the Germans are our friends, our allies, our European partners, that what's done is done, that there's no point in harking back because (my great favourite) it's 'not useful', so whatever you do: Don't Mention The War. This is a unique exemption that we afford the German people. The general rule - most especially for those of the liberal Left - is to show off the history that informs your conversation. You cannot hold views on, say, Ireland, unless you can drop with ease such dates as 1916, 1920 or, if you want to be dead flash, the rebellion of 1641. A debate on Palestinian land rights is incomplete without dragging in Balfour, and when it comes to the Balkans, wow! There are those who can play with 900 years on that one. The role of the British in world history informs the liberal most of all: what 'we' did to the Aborigine, to the Indian, what part 'we' played in American slavery or the ransacking of the Far East. 'We', of course, did none of it; our great-great-forefathers did. But never mind - a little conscience goes a long way and is, thus, no bad thing. Yet if we are to remember our great-greats, if we are to remember what William did and what Patrick did next, or how the proud Ibo was abducted from his native land and carried to the cotton fields all those years ago, then I cannot see why we are not supposed to remember what Hans's daddy did, just a blink away from yesterday. In fact, Don't Mention The War is usually only a euphemism; what we are really saying is Don't Mention The Holocaust. We act as if it is somehow vulgar and indelicate to refer to one of the greatest obscenities in the history of the world, particularly because it might, heaven forfend, upset Hans if we do. Well, tough. Fact One: it happened. Fact Two: it happened because a great many Germans made it happen, and a great many more let them. Fact Three: the people in power in Germany today are the first generation after; the children of those who did and those who let. And it beggars belief to suggest that their family relationships had neither influence nor effect. I need look no further than my own family to illustrate. When I was young, we would bicker with the best of them as my parents expressed their views while I formed mine. Few such views, in the end, passed directly down; my mother, for example, had faith where I have not, my father (occasionally) voted Conservative, which I do not. Now I bicker with my daughter in the same way - lordy, you should hear her on the Prince of Wales, for whom she shows inexplicable support, and for dozens of her own reasons she would prefer that I was not writing this piece today. Nevertheless, although our views may be different, I am struck by how our values are not. What we hold in common is greater and, I venture, more important than that which divides us - like, just for instance, how you should try to treat with respect those who differ from you in opinion, in culture, in sexuality, in caste or in creed. So why is it rude or foolish or prejudiced to consider that Hans and millions of his cousins might have been just as greatly influenced by the people they loved most, when they were knee-high to an impressionable age?

When BMW bought Rover, British experts lined up to advise the German carmaker on how to transform the mutt into a pedigree, but their wisdom was reportedly ignored. </p> <p>Last week they queued to deride BMW's cries that it was all the British Government's fault that Rover fell apart.

As was the filling the water-glass bit, and the brushing-fluff-off-the-suit bit. 'There isn't anyone , dear,' comes the whine that night. Much less convincing. We're winning, girls. Wednesday: Tony has decided, wisely and bravely, to blame Gordon if it all goes wrong. Lots of muttering about taxes going up, unelectability, heads rolling, Scots, bachelors, etc. Papers ecstatic. Country ecstatic. People want to pay more taxes. Tony has decided, wisely and bravely, to take credit for the Budget. Thursday: Lisbon lovely. Schr\u00f6der less so. Tony shouted at him for a while, until he was asked, politely, whether there were perhaps any personal problems in his life. Friday: I point out to Tony that the country hasn't yet disintegrated in his absence, and smile sweetly. Oh yes, I think this is going to be fun.",

      "body": "<p>Politicians tend to be pretty weird people with more eccentricities and obsessions than most of us. But some are better than others at conveying an image of solid common-sense and down-to-earth reliability.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is, I'm sure, seething with all kinds of strange and powerful emotions, but he still manages to appear as a shrewd and sensible Scotsman - just the man to be trusted with the country's finances and even, hopefully, with the country as a whole.</p> <p>In contrast Mr Blair, with his shining eyes and happy-clappy manner, has always looked pretty batty, albeit in a reasonably harmless way. The same is true of his wife, Cherie, who gives an impression, perhaps unfairly, of having only limited contact with the real world.</p> <p>All the silliness of the Blairs came out last week when Cherie made some heavy hints in a public speech that she was expecting her husband to follow the example of the Finnish Prime Minister and take some weeks off when their new baby arrives in May.</p> <p>To what possible purpose? The idea of paternity leave is a peculiar one in any case, given the fact that new-born babies spend most of their time sleeping. The Blairs we can be fairly sure will in any case employ a live-in nanny to do most of the baby care. And at the earliest opportu nity, after a month or so, Cherie Blair will return to her highly paid legal job leaving the nanny in control. From then on neither pair will see much of their child. So why should anyone be impressed if in the early days Mr Blair takes time off from his duties to be with Mrs Blair? The only result of all this is to make both the Blairs look even sillier than they do at present, thereby once again enhancing the image of Mr Brown as the solid Scotsman with little time for this kind of nonsense.</p> <p><b> Batty barons</b><br> IF ANY CLASS of person is generally battier than politicians it must be the press barons with their long tradition going back to the founder of the modern press, the great Lord Northcliffe, who was literally insane during his final years.</p> <p>The first Lord Rothermere was a great admirer of Adolf Hitler. Rupert Murdoch similarly reveres Mr Pat Robertson, the would-be American president and anti-Semite who claims to be able to speak in tongues. 'He's right on all the issues,' the Digger told his faithful lieutenant, Andrew Neil.</p> <p>Several press lords have been Canadian like Lord Beaverbrook and the former owner of the Times and Sunday Times Lord Thompson of Fleet. Lord Thomson was asked once by a reporter if he regretted not having been to university. He replied: 'If I'd been to university I'd be working today for someone like me.'</p> <p>Continuing the tradition is another Canadian, the present owner of the Daily Telegraph Conrad Black. Mr Black, who has described himself as an amateur psychiatrist and who has a worrying fascination with Napoleon, has recently developed a taste for litigation. Last year he issued proceedings against the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien, who has managed to obstruct the life peerage that Tony Blair is keen to bestow on Britain's most right-wing newspaper owner.</p> <p>Now Mr Black has issued a writ for libel against Sir Paul Lever, the British ambassador in Berlin who, in an interview with the German paper, Die Welt , accused the Telegraph of being anti-German. Although Sir Paul wrote a conciliatory letter to the Telegraph , backtracking from his earlier comments, Mr Black is not satisfied.

      "bodyText": "Politicians tend to be pretty weird people with more eccentricities and obsessions than most of us. But some are better than others at conveying an image of solid common-sense and down-to-earth reliability. Gordon Brown is, I'm sure, seething with all kinds of strange and powerful emotions, but he still manages to appear as a shrewd and sensible Scotsman - just the man to be trusted with the country's finances and even, hopefully, with the country as a whole. In contrast Mr Blair, with his shining eyes and happy-clappy manner, has always looked pretty batty, albeit in a reasonably harmless way. The same is true of his wife, Cherie, who gives an impression, perhaps unfairly, of having only limited contact with the real world. All the silliness of the Blairs came out last week when Cherie made some heavy hints in a public speech that she was expecting her husband to follow the example of the Finnish Prime Minister and take some weeks off when their new baby arrives in May. To what possible purpose? The idea of paternity leave is a peculiar one in any case, given the fact that new-born babies spend most of their time sleeping. The Blairs we can be fairly sure will in any case employ a live-in nanny to do most of the baby care. And at the earliest opportu nity, after a month or so, Cherie Blair will return to her highly paid legal job leaving the nanny in control. From then on neither pair will see much of their child. So why should anyone be impressed if in the early days Mr Blair takes time off from his duties to be with Mrs Blair? The only result of all this is to make both the Blairs look even sillier than they do at present, thereby once again enhancing the image of Mr Brown as the solid Scotsman with little time for this kind of nonsense. Batty barons IF ANY CLASS of person is generally battier than politicians it must be the press barons with their long tradition going back to the founder of the modern press, the great Lord Northcliffe, who was literally insane during his final years. The first Lord Rothermere was a great admirer of Adolf Hitler. Rupert Murdoch similarly reveres Mr Pat Robertson, the would-be American president and anti-Semite who claims to be able to speak in tongues. 'He's right on all the issues,' the Digger told his faithful lieutenant, Andrew Neil. Several press lords have been Canadian like Lord Beaverbrook and the former owner of the Times and Sunday Times Lord Thompson of Fleet. Lord Thomson was asked once by a reporter if he regretted not having been to university. He replied: 'If I'd been to university I'd be working today for someone like me.' Continuing the tradition is another Canadian, the present owner of the Daily Telegraph Conrad Black. Mr Black, who has described himself as an amateur psychiatrist and who has a worrying fascination with Napoleon, has recently developed a taste for litigation. Last year he issued proceedings against the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien, who has managed to obstruct the life peerage that Tony Blair is keen to bestow on Britain's most right-wing newspaper owner. Now Mr Black has issued a writ for libel against Sir Paul Lever, the British ambassador in Berlin who, in an interview with the German paper, Die Welt , accused the Telegraph of being anti-German. Although Sir Paul wrote a conciliatory letter to the Telegraph , backtracking from his earlier comments, Mr Black is not satisfied. He is fed up, he says, with being described as a Euro-phobic foreigner and will not rest until every single word has been retracted by the ambassador in open court. Who will be the next to get a writ from Mr Black? Possibly Sinn Fein/IRA for objecting to the Telegraph 's strongly pro-Unionist bias. Whatever happens, we shall all have to watch our step in future before voicing any criticism of Mr Black and his outstandingly brilliant and impartial newspaper. Perks and peers AS ALWAYS wearing a seraphic and slightly foolish smile, the newly ennobled Lord Birt of Wood Lane has been pictured at his installation in the House of Lords, standing proudly with his sponsor, the former BBC employee Baroness Jay of Paddington. The peerage is good news for all those who make a complete balls-up of things in their chosen profession. Abject failure, even on the John Birt scale, is no longer any bar to perks and peerages. Another happy beneficiary of this new enlightened approach towards general uselessness will be the woman behind the Millennium Dome, Jennie Page, who, according to reports, will be made a Dame in the next available Honours List. Ms Page was sacked from the Dome project at the insistence of her colleague the British Airways boss Bob Ayling, but he in turn has now been sacked by BA to the apparent rejoicing of pretty well all his staff. Never mind. Mr Ayling is, we are told, also now in the running for an honour - probably a peerage just like John Birt's. This could be the solution perhaps to the still unsolved problem of what to do about Piers Morgan, the much reviled wheeler-dealer editor of the Daily Mirror who has given Mr Blair and his government so much hurtful support in his paper. He, too, could be given a life peerage and as Lord Morgan of Viglen, enjoy an honourable retirement with plenty of time still to pursue his hobby of stockmarket speculation.",

      "body": "<p>Budgets are all about tax. Well... not this one. This was about public spending, and especially health spending. Perhaps you thought spending decisions were now made once every three years in the Spending Review in July. Tony Blair did too apparently. On the Breakfast with Frost interview which launched the health spending debate on 16 January he said of health spending: 'If this July when we work out the next three year period... ' That job has now been done early, and we were told in the Budget what health spending would be for four years from this April. </p> <p>The big picture here is that when the Government came to power it faced high, albeit falling, public borrowing. This led it to increase taxation and hold public spending down so as to be sure of meeting its own public borrowing rules. In the last three years the economy has done well and it now seems that the tax increases were greater than needed to bring the public finances into shape. On Budget day, Gordon Brown announced increases in public spending for the future, funded by the past tax increases. Spending on health and education is going up. </p> <p>So for 2000-01, health spending rises by an extra \u00a32 billion, which when added to the previous plans gives a real increase of 7.4 per cent. Education gets an extra \u00a31bn, which will give it an overall annual real increase of 9 per cent. There is also extra money for transport and the Home Office, of \u00a3280 million and \u00a3285m respectively. Beyond 2000-01, we are told about the health spending for the following three years. Over the period from 1999-2000 to 2003-04 real spending on health will grow at an average of 6.1 per cent. </p> <p>This is a long period of growth above what the NHS has ever seen so far: 3.7 per cent. These increases may almost bring health spending in the UK to one version of the EU average. The injection of funds is very large. One natural question is whether this means that health will absorb all the resources that are available for increased spending in the next few years. Such an outcome would be very odd, and inconsistent with the Government's statement that education is a top priority. </p> <p>We don't yet know the detailed allocation for any spending department other than health, but the Budget did announce the overall public spending limits until 2003-04. Total spending is to grow at 3.4 per cent p.a. in real terms from April 2001. So even if education spending grows over the whole period at the same rate as health, all other items of spending could grow at 2.5 per cent. Health and education spending would go on growing as a share of total spending, but other departments need not be squeezed to pay for it. </p> <p>How can this be possible? Will tax have to rise in future to pay for Brown's largesse? Over the next four years, the answer is no. The tax increases needed to pay for this spending growth, which exceeds the rate of growth of the economy, happened in the July 1997 and March 1998 Budgets, and they're being spent not on reducing tax rates and bringing the tax burden back down, but on public services. Ironically, this means the Conservative 'tax guarantee' could probably be delivered in the next Parliament. The Government budget forecast shows the tax burden falling from 39.9 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 39.3 per cent in 2004-05. This is still higher than the 37.6, but would be falling in a Parliament running from 2001. </p> <p>But this shouldn't delude us into thinking that in the long run a policy of increased public spending doesn't mean increased taxation (or for that matter that reduced taxes don't imply reduced spending). It does, and in this case the taxation has already been done. There has been some debate over whether fiscal policy is being tightened or loosened as a result of the Budget. The Treasury's Budget Red Book states that the effect of the policy measures in the Budget is a reduction in the Budget surplus of \u00a34bn in 2000-01, rising to \u00a316bn in 2003-04. That is the equivalent by 2003-04 of the cost of cutting the basic rate of income tax by 5p to 17p. This is a loos ening. It is also true that the Budget surplus is now forecast to be higher in 2000-01 than it was forecast to be for that year in the March 1999 Budget, which suggests policy is tighter now than it was expected to be then. But the important point is that the Budget announces dramatically increased public spending - a loosening of policy. </p> <p>Where does this leave the Comprehensive Spending Review process, meant to deliver firm three-year spending plans which would 'provide departments with a solid basis for planning'? Eleven months into the first year of the first three-year cycle, the spending plans for year two for health, education, transport and the Home Office have been rewritten, and year three is to become year one of the second spending review. Only half of overall public spending plans were ever covered by the three-year plans, but that now seems to have fallen to just a fifth of government spending - basically defence, agriculture and trade and industry. The annual big spend is back. </p> <p>This was the health service Budget, and the sums pledged are large. Since overall government spending will rise as a share of national income, education can also expect big increases. The combination of earlier tax increases and a strong economy means this can be paid for by allowing borrowing to rise, not taxes. </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Dilnot is Director, and Carl Emmerson a senior research economist, at the Institute for Fiscal Studies</p>",

There is also extra money for transport and the Home Office, of \u00a3280 million and \u00a3285m respectively. Beyond 2000-01, we are told about the health spending for the following three years. Over the period from 1999-2000 to 2003-04 real spending on health will grow at an average of 6.1 per cent. This is a long period of growth above what the NHS has ever seen so far: 3.7 per cent. These increases may almost bring health spending in the UK to one version of the EU average. The injection of funds is very large. One natural question is whether this means that health will absorb all the resources that are available for increased spending in the next few years. Such an outcome would be very odd, and inconsistent with the Government's statement that education is a top priority. We don't yet know the detailed allocation for any spending department other than health, but the Budget did announce the overall public spending limits until 2003-04. Total spending is to grow at 3.4 per cent p.a. in real terms from April 2001. So even if education spending grows over the whole period at the same rate as health, all other items of spending could grow at 2.5 per cent. Health and education spending would go on growing as a share of total spending, but other departments need not be squeezed to pay for it. How can this be possible? Will tax have to rise in future to pay for Brown's largesse? Over the next four years, the answer is no. The tax increases needed to pay for this spending growth, which exceeds the rate of growth of the economy, happened in the July 1997 and March 1998 Budgets, and they're being spent not on reducing tax rates and bringing the tax burden back down, but on public services. Ironically, this means the Conservative 'tax guarantee' could probably be delivered in the next Parliament. The Government budget forecast shows the tax burden falling from 39.9 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 39.3 per cent in 2004-05. This is still higher than the 37.6, but would be falling in a Parliament running from 2001. But this shouldn't delude us into thinking that in the long run a policy of increased public spending doesn't mean increased taxation (or for that matter that reduced taxes don't imply reduced spending). It does, and in this case the taxation has already been done. There has been some debate over whether fiscal policy is being tightened or loosened as a result of the Budget. The Treasury's Budget Red Book states that the effect of the policy measures in the Budget is a reduction in the Budget surplus of \u00a34bn in 2000-01, rising to \u00a316bn in 2003-04. That is the equivalent by 2003-04 of the cost of cutting the basic rate of income tax by 5p to 17p. This is a loos ening. It is also true that the Budget surplus is now forecast to be higher in 2000-01 than it was forecast to be for that year in the March 1999 Budget, which suggests policy is tighter now than it was expected to be then. But the important point is that the Budget announces dramatically increased public spending - a loosening of policy. Where does this leave the Comprehensive Spending Review process, meant to deliver firm three-year spending plans which would 'provide departments with a solid basis for planning'? Eleven months into the first year of the first three-year cycle, the spending plans for year two for health, education, transport and the Home Office have been rewritten, and year three is to become year one of the second spending review. Only half of overall public spending plans were ever covered by the three-year plans, but that now seems to have fallen to just a fifth of government spending - basically defence, agriculture and trade and industry. The annual big spend is back. This was the health service Budget, and the sums pledged are large. Since overall government spending will rise as a share of national income, education can also expect big increases. The combination of earlier tax increases and a strong economy means this can be paid for by allowing borrowing to rise, not taxes. \u0095 Andrew Dilnot is Director, and Carl Emmerson a senior research economist, at the Institute for Fiscal Studies",

      "body": "<p>Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, knew what his reaction was going to be. He had seen it all before. He wrote a draft press release declaring his disappointment and then sat down in his ornate offices with an air of resignation to watch the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, deliver his fourth Budget. </p> <p>But the press release never went out. As soon as Brown sat down, Bogle ripped it up and started again. 'We saw more money than we ever envisaged. It was really exciting,' he said. The final press release began with the words: 'We are delighted. 'Bogle jumped in a taxi to meet the other heads of the medical profession who had watched the Budget on television in the office of the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn. Milburn had phoned them that morning to ask them along to Richmond House. </p> <p>The assembled heads of the royal colleges had no idea what to expect when they sat down with Department of Health tea and biscuits to watch the Budget. But as Brown announced the biggest ever increase in spending on the NHS - with straightforward figures and no double counting - they were stunned into silence. Professor Sir George Alberti, president of the Royal College of Physicians, banged the table with excitement. </p> <p>Brown had announced not just an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS this year, but a sustained increase of 6 per cent above the rate of inflation for the next four years. The amount spent on health would rise from \u00a31,850 per household last year, to \u00a32,800 per household in 2004, bringing it within striking distance of the much-vaunted European average. </p> <p>But the medical leaders were quickly left in no doubt that the money would come with strings attached. As soon as Brown had delivered the Budget, Milburn rushed back from Parliament to brief them about how he and the Prime Minister wanted their help in drawing up plans to modernise the NHS, to make sure that the money was not just poured down a bottomless pit. </p> <p>They then left for Downing Street, where Tony Blair reiterated the message: 'We've given you the resources, now deliver the modernisation.' Blair was enlisting the help of the doctors, nurses and managers in what he sees as a battle for the survival of the NHS. If they do not succeed, those that want to privatise it almost certainly will. </p> <p>The winter crisis had made clear beyond any doubt that the under-resourced and often chaotic NHS was costing lives. The horror stories came to light daily, but it was poor Mavis Skeet whose plight symbolised all that was wrong with the NHS. Because of the shortage of beds, her cancer operation was cancelled four times before her doctors declared her condition was inoperable. </p> <p>The crisis in the NHS wasn't just eroding Labour's poll ratings, but also public support for the state-funded, free-at-the-point-of-access health system that had once been Britain's pride. The Conservatives, and increasing numbers of doctors, declared the present system beyond repair, and urged the promotion of private medicine. Patients voted with their wallets, and went private in rapidly growing numbers. </p> <p>Blair realised that without radical measures, he would go down in history as the Prime Minister who pledged to save the NHS, but ended up destroying it. </p> <p>The winter crisis had given a sense of urgency to the plans, but Ministers and their officials had been working on them since last autumn. Milburn, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was drawing up government-wide spending plans until 2004. But he had previously been a junior Health Minister - and his partner is an NHS consultant - and he knew that it would be impossible to modernise the NHS without dramatically increasing resources. </p> <p>Eventually, Downing Street and Brown came round to Milburn's argument. When Blair promised to David Frost on TV in January that Labour would increase health spending up to European levels, it was no slip of the tongue. The only reason his spokesman then officially downgraded it to an 'aspiration' was that they did not want to be forced into giving the whole game away. </p> <p>In what amounts to a dramatic mid-term relaunch of health policy, Blair outlined his plans to Parliament the day after the Budget. It was the first time that he had personally made an announcement to Parliament on a domestic spending issue. Blair was to chair a new Cabinet committee on modernising the NHS, with six new task forces in the Department of Health tackling issues ranging from professional development to patient empowerment.

'It's a method of working we thought no government would try,' said Bogle. 'But the other way, of \"let's bang the profession on the head\", just hasn't worked. It took them three years to see the light, but at least they did.' </p> <p>Behind it lies a shrewd political calculation. By giving so much extra cash, Blair has made it impossible for health workers to claim they cannot modernise because of lack of resources. 'It makes things possible,' admitted Alberti. 'Without the money it would have been extremely difficult.' By bringing the health professionals on board, he is making them jointly responsible for the success of NHS rescue plans. </p> <p>The doctors and managers are under no illusions about the scale of the task. The variation in performance between health authorities and hospitals can be startling - and almost inexplicable. While some hospitals have no one waiting more than six months, others have more than half their patients waiting that long. In some hospitals, consultants are doing half the number of operations as in others. </p> <p>'It's going to be monstrously difficult to turn around a levi-athan, but it needs turning around,' said Alberti. It's already clear that any improvements will take time - and there will be few instant results. Nigel Edwards, policy director of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS managers, said: 'I doubt in a very short period that you would notice much. Employing staff and setting up services takes at least three to six months.' </p> <p>But pilot programmes around the country have already shown the scale of what can be done. A scheme in west London to get cancer specialist workers co-operating more closely has reduced waiting times for diagnosis from 20 weeks to three weeks. A scheme in Birmingham reduced waiting times for referral to a consultant from 10 weeks to 10 days. </p> <p>There are also likely to be fights. Even though both managers and doctors are committed to the new project, they do not see eye to eye. The NHS Confederation made clear last week that it thinks managers have done their part, and that it is the doctors - and their insistence on clinical freedoms - that are the barrier to modernisation. 'We know there are doctors who are not pulling their weight, but there's very little you can do about it,' said Edwards. 'They say they can't do something by invoking the guidelines that are drawn up by the royal colleges, but the royal colleges are accountable to no one except perhaps God.' </p> <p>Alberti insists that such attitudes are inflammatory. 'We don't want to get into a dogfight,' he said. 'We know we can't continue in the same old way. In the last few years a lot of royal colleges have realised they have to get with it, or they've had it.' </p> <p>Despite the rift, managers and doctors are committed to drawing up the plans to modernise the NHS, which will be announced by Blair in July. It falls to Peter Homa, head of the new Commission for Health Improvement - nicknamed Chimp - to make sure that the best procedures are adopted. In his Commons announcement last week, Blair described Chimp as the Ofsted for the health service. </p> <p>From April, Homa will be sending in teams of inspectors into hospitals and GPs' practices.

      "bodyText": "Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, knew what his reaction was going to be. He had seen it all before. He wrote a draft press release declaring his disappointment and then sat down in his ornate offices with an air of resignation to watch the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, deliver his fourth Budget. But the press release never went out. As soon as Brown sat down, Bogle ripped it up and started again. 'We saw more money than we ever envisaged. It was really exciting,' he said. The final press release began with the words: 'We are delighted. 'Bogle jumped in a taxi to meet the other heads of the medical profession who had watched the Budget on television in the office of the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn. Milburn had phoned them that morning to ask them along to Richmond House. The assembled heads of the royal colleges had no idea what to expect when they sat down with Department of Health tea and biscuits to watch the Budget. But as Brown announced the biggest ever increase in spending on the NHS - with straightforward figures and no double counting - they were stunned into silence. Professor Sir George Alberti, president of the Royal College of Physicians, banged the table with excitement. Brown had announced not just an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS this year, but a sustained increase of 6 per cent above the rate of inflation for the next four years. The amount spent on health would rise from \u00a31,850 per household last year, to \u00a32,800 per household in 2004, bringing it within striking distance of the much-vaunted European average. But the medical leaders were quickly left in no doubt that the money would come with strings attached. As soon as Brown had delivered the Budget, Milburn rushed back from Parliament to brief them about how he and the Prime Minister wanted their help in drawing up plans to modernise the NHS, to make sure that the money was not just poured down a bottomless pit. They then left for Downing Street, where Tony Blair reiterated the message: 'We've given you the resources, now deliver the modernisation.' Blair was enlisting the help of the doctors, nurses and managers in what he sees as a battle for the survival of the NHS. If they do not succeed, those that want to privatise it almost certainly will. The winter crisis had made clear beyond any doubt that the under-resourced and often chaotic NHS was costing lives. The horror stories came to light daily, but it was poor Mavis Skeet whose plight symbolised all that was wrong with the NHS. Because of the shortage of beds, her cancer operation was cancelled four times before her doctors declared her condition was inoperable. The crisis in the NHS wasn't just eroding Labour's poll ratings, but also public support for the state-funded, free-at-the-point-of-access health system that had once been Britain's pride. The Conservatives, and increasing numbers of doctors, declared the present system beyond repair, and urged the promotion of private medicine. Patients voted with their wallets, and went private in rapidly growing numbers. Blair realised that without radical measures, he would go down in history as the Prime Minister who pledged to save the NHS, but ended up destroying it. The winter crisis had given a sense of urgency to the plans, but Ministers and their officials had been working on them since last autumn. Milburn, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was drawing up government-wide spending plans until 2004. But he had previously been a junior Health Minister - and his partner is an NHS consultant - and he knew that it would be impossible to modernise the NHS without dramatically increasing resources. Eventually, Downing Street and Brown came round to Milburn's argument. When Blair promised to David Frost on TV in January that Labour would increase health spending up to European levels, it was no slip of the tongue. The only reason his spokesman then officially downgraded it to an 'aspiration' was that they did not want to be forced into giving the whole game away. In what amounts to a dramatic mid-term relaunch of health policy, Blair outlined his plans to Parliament the day after the Budget. It was the first time that he had personally made an announcement to Parliament on a domestic spending issue. Blair was to chair a new Cabinet committee on modernising the NHS, with six new task forces in the Department of Health tackling issues ranging from professional development to patient empowerment. The task forces, staffed by representatives of NHS managers, doctors, nurses and patients, have been given four months to come up with plans to drag the worst performing parts of the health service up to the standards of the best performing. The medical profession was as stunned by the fact they were being asked - rather than told - what to do, as they were by the extra cash. 'It's a method of working we thought no government would try,' said Bogle. 'But the other way, of \"let's bang the profession on the head\", just hasn't worked. It took them three years to see the light, but at least they did.' Behind it lies a shrewd political calculation. By giving so much extra cash, Blair has made it impossible for health workers to claim they cannot modernise because of lack of resources. 'It makes things possible,' admitted Alberti. 'Without the money it would have been extremely difficult.' By bringing the health professionals on board, he is making them jointly responsible for the success of NHS rescue plans. The doctors and managers are under no illusions about the scale of the task. The variation in performance between health authorities and hospitals can be startling - and almost inexplicable.

In some hospitals, consultants are doing half the number of operations as in others. 'It's going to be monstrously difficult to turn around a levi-athan, but it needs turning around,' said Alberti.

Labour prefers to spend cash on improving the quality of public services to tax cuts. The Tories do not. It is a politically defining moment.</p> <p>More than that, Brown is doing two things that have needlessly eluded the British Left for too long. He combines a political position at once sympathetic to entrepreneurship and business-building with a concern for social justice.</p> <p>The social-democratic Left's position has always been that the dynamism of capitalism should be harnessed for the common good; that not only can you be simultaneously in favour both of making money and redistributing it, but that successful public services and help for the disadvantaged are predicated upon such capitalist vitality. Brown is living political proof that the syllogism works.</p> <p>And he has built up such a strong financial position that he is able to turn on the spending tap in Year Four of a parliament, unlike every other post-war Labour chancellor who has to had to launch painful spending cuts at this stage in the parliament. Moreover he has not had to soak the rich and middle classes to fund his ambitions. It is good, even very good; and it is hard to believe that the country can seriously contemplate electing the Tories, with their infantile approach to taxation and public spending, in Labour's place.</p> <p>But if the central strategy is on the button, there are qualifications and reservations around the edges that explain why so many have had such serious doubts about New Labour. For a start Brown, for the third year running, has been dramatically caught out disguising the lusty health of the public finances in the name of prudence. This time last year he said he would borrow \u00a33bn in the financial year just ending, a forecast that looked implausibly pessimistic at the time; in the event he has repaid \u00a312bn of the national debt.</p> <p>He is congratulated for his probity - yet if the Treasury's forecasting had been remotely accurate the big build-up in public spending could have started a year ago. Financial 'prudence' has taken precedence over real lives. For some children in sink schools and NHS patients, that's a lost year which can never be brought back, and which so easily could have been avoided.</p> <p>This time round we're asked to believe it's different, and that the combination of a big build-up in capital investment, growing by 33 per cent a year, and the projected increases in health spending will see the Government ceasing to pay off the national debt in 2002.</p> <p>As for prudence, even if the economy grows 1 per cent a year less rapidly than the cautious central forecast of 2.25 per cent a year assumed by the Treasury, we needn't worry our heads. The surpluses will still be high enough for the Government to meet its own criteria for financial caution - already the toughest of any leading industrialised country.</p> <p>Extraordinarily this understates Brown's strength, to which he will still not admit. Only on Friday the auction of the next generation of mobile phone licences had raised \u00a34.5bn; when completed next month the auction will raise \u00a310bn - at least \u00a37.5bn more than Brown has included in the budget projections. Not since Drake's Golden Hind moored in the pool of London laden with Spanish gold has any British government been as unexpectedly rich as this.</p> <p>What this means, amazingly, is that Brown could do much, much more. He could index the growth of social security benefits to wages rather than the much lower growth in prices. He could scrap the disabling Private Finance Initiative, which has so shrunk the size of new hospitals for example, and relegitimise public-private partnerships by putting the public sector in the financial driving seat in deals with the private sector. Cuts in incapacity benefit could be restored. The scope for jury trial could be extended rather than narrowed, and the capacity of Britain's creaking courts doubled. The science budget could be made the most generous in Europe. The road and rail system could be made world-class. And with never a further rise in any tax rate.</p> <p>So far only the NHS has been formally allowed to share in the bounty. Health expenditure is set to rise for the three years after next by 5.6 per cent in real terms, to give a four-year increase of 6.1 per cent - three times the real growth in NHS spending between 1992 and 1998.</p> <p>Although education spending is slated to fall back again next year, according to the old forecasts, the inside steer is to expect the growth in edu cation spending to match health. But if we are to believe Brown's numbers, the implication is that the rest of the public sector will continue to be squeezed - with current spending on housing, law and order, transport and the rest only growing by 1.6 per cent in real terms to allow for the growth in health and education.</p> <p>If Brown does allow such a squeeze, his only let-out will be that the economy will have got so close to full capacity that any more spending would be inflationary. But even that argument would be dubious. There is scope to increase taxes, notably reforming council tax so that it becomes a proper progressive tax on property, that would allow increased spending while withdrawing demand from the economy. Brown holds every fiscal ace.</p> <p>The question-mark is over the scope of his progressive ambition. In this budget, for example, he offered nothing to advance the cause of Lord Roger's urban task force; no taxation of greenfield development - no incentive for brownfield development. He backed off the Cruickshank report's call for regulating the ludicrously high monopoly profits the banks make from operating the cheque-clearing system.</p> <p>He caved in to Eurosceptics and the City's desire to become the world centre of tax avoidance by the abolition of withholding tax on international bonds. And he has, over the past few months, been less than progressive about both BBC funding and the minimum wage. Not so good.</p> <p>But the central point stands. Last week we saw why Blair tolerates his brooding Heathcliff of a Chancellor. He delivers. And it takes an obsessive to have the self-discipline and rigour to have put the British Left where it now is. We all have ideas about how we would spend Brown's largesse. But it took Gordon to get us here.</p>",

It is good, even very good; and it is hard to believe that the country can seriously contemplate electing the Tories, with their infantile approach to taxation and public spending, in Labour's place. But if the central strategy is on the button, there are qualifications and reservations around the edges that explain why so many have had such serious doubts about New Labour. For a start Brown, for the third year running, has been dramatically caught out disguising the lusty health of the public finances in the name of prudence. This time last year he said he would borrow \u00a33bn in the financial year just ending, a forecast that looked implausibly pessimistic at the time; in the event he has repaid \u00a312bn of the national debt. He is congratulated for his probity - yet if the Treasury's forecasting had been remotely accurate the big build-up in public spending could have started a year ago. Financial 'prudence' has taken precedence over real lives. For some children in sink schools and NHS patients, that's a lost year which can never be brought back, and which so easily could have been avoided. This time round we're asked to believe it's different, and that the combination of a big build-up in capital investment, growing by 33 per cent a year, and the projected increases in health spending will see the Government ceasing to pay off the national debt in 2002. As for prudence, even if the economy grows 1 per cent a year less rapidly than the cautious central forecast of 2.25 per cent a year assumed by the Treasury, we needn't worry our heads. The surpluses will still be high enough for the Government to meet its own criteria for financial caution - already the toughest of any leading industrialised country. Extraordinarily this understates Brown's strength, to which he will still not admit. Only on Friday the auction of the next generation of mobile phone licences had raised \u00a34.5bn; when completed next month the auction will raise \u00a310bn - at least \u00a37.5bn more than Brown has included in the budget projections. Not since Drake's Golden Hind moored in the pool of London laden with Spanish gold has any British government been as unexpectedly rich as this. What this means, amazingly, is that Brown could do much, much more. He could index the growth of social security benefits to wages rather than the much lower growth in prices. He could scrap the disabling Private Finance Initiative, which has so shrunk the size of new hospitals for example, and relegitimise public-private partnerships by putting the public sector in the financial driving seat in deals with the private sector. Cuts in incapacity benefit could be restored. The scope for jury trial could be extended rather than narrowed, and the capacity of Britain's creaking courts doubled. The science budget could be made the most generous in Europe. The road and rail system could be made world-class. And with never a further rise in any tax rate. So far only the NHS has been formally allowed to share in the bounty. Health expenditure is set to rise for the three years after next by 5.6 per cent in real terms, to give a four-year increase of 6.1 per cent - three times the real growth in NHS spending between 1992 and 1998. Although education spending is slated to fall back again next year, according to the old forecasts, the inside steer is to expect the growth in edu cation spending to match health. But if we are to believe Brown's numbers, the implication is that the rest of the public sector will continue to be squeezed - with current spending on housing, law and order, transport and the rest only growing by 1.6 per cent in real terms to allow for the growth in health and education. If Brown does allow such a squeeze, his only let-out will be that the economy will have got so close to full capacity that any more spending would be inflationary. But even that argument would be dubious. There is scope to increase taxes, notably reforming council tax so that it becomes a proper progressive tax on property, that would allow increased spending while withdrawing demand from the economy. Brown holds every fiscal ace. The question-mark is over the scope of his progressive ambition. In this budget, for example, he offered nothing to advance the cause of Lord Roger's urban task force; no taxation of greenfield development - no incentive for brownfield development. He backed off the Cruickshank report's call for regulating the ludicrously high monopoly profits the banks make from operating the cheque-clearing system. He caved in to Eurosceptics and the City's desire to become the world centre of tax avoidance by the abolition of withholding tax on international bonds. And he has, over the past few months, been less than progressive about both BBC funding and the minimum wage. Not so good. But the central point stands. Last week we saw why Blair tolerates his brooding Heathcliff of a Chancellor. He delivers. And it takes an obsessive to have the self-discipline and rigour to have put the British Left where it now is. We all have ideas about how we would spend Brown's largesse. But it took Gordon to get us here.",

In 1979, again in 1983, again in 1987, and yet again in 1992, the Left fought with out-dated weapons against an enemy that dictated the battlefield. Like the Polish cavalry charging German Panzers, at every encounter the progressive forces were crushed by the forces of Conservatism. Eventually, a Tory party exhausted, corrupted and divided by all those years in power, and confronted with the brilliant remake called New Labour, finally lost in 1997. Even then, the Left still did not really win.</p> <p>Oh sure, in terms of giant swings and swags of parliamentary seats, Tony Blair had a smashing, record-booking victory.

      "bodyText": "Some moments in politics are so sensational that everyone misses them. It is a clich\u00e9 everywhere acknowledged that New Labour will win the next election. Any fool knows, as every wise man also forecasts, that Tony Blair will not only secure that unprecedented second term for a government of the Left, he'll probably do so handsomely. The assumption, widespread before the Budget, has since become even more universal. In the space of three years, what history told us was wildly unlikely has become the confident prediction of every futurologist. The world stands on its head. The Right has triumphed at every British general election since before the beginning of my adult life. In 1979, again in 1983, again in 1987, and yet again in 1992, the Left fought with out-dated weapons against an enemy that dictated the battlefield. Like the Polish cavalry charging German Panzers, at every encounter the progressive forces were crushed by the forces of Conservatism. Eventually, a Tory party exhausted, corrupted and divided by all those years in power, and confronted with the brilliant remake called New Labour, finally lost in 1997. Even then, the Left still did not really win. Oh sure, in terms of giant swings and swags of parliamentary seats, Tony Blair had a smashing, record-booking victory. But New Labour advanced into office by surrendering territory to the Right. The most important promises Tony Blair and Gordon Brown made to gain power were the things they felt compelled to pledge themselves not to do. They would not put up income tax. They would not spend more than the Conservatives in the first two years.

      "body": "<p>It is a clich\u00e9 to say that lawyers make dangerous politicians, but hard times have a depressing tendency to prove the truth of platitudes. The assaults on trial by jury, the interning of asylum seekers (which treats the genuine victims of the world's greatest crimes as criminals) and the attack on legal aid for the working and lower-middle classes are being organised by the lawyerly \u00e9lite which dominates New Labour.</p> <p>The barrister directors of UK plc include Tony Blair and the First Lady, Jack Straw, Lord Falconer of the Dismal Dome and a friend of the Prime Minister since childhood, and - as if we could forget - His Eminence, Cardinal Irvine, the Lord High Chancellor of all England (and Wales, too), who was the head of Tony's and Cherie's chambers when they were bright-eyed young briefs.</p> <p>'Lawyer' is not a particularly illuminating word in this context. We need to be specific. As in other professions, the explosion of income inequality since the 1970s has produced staggering divisions in the law. A solicitor in Rochdale on a salary of \u00a340,000 who helps battered wives and defends petty suspects has nothing common with a \u00a31-million-a-year partner in Herbert Smith or Clifford Chance. The commercial lawyers of the City of London and Inns of Court have not learned the hard way that a citizen must be presumed innocent until found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a jury of his peers. They have never cross-examined a lying policeman or seen jurors bristle when a biased judge rants. Their training is in tax liabilities, not civil liberties.</p> <p>Needless to say, the Government's lawyers are commercial lawyers, as are the Law Lords the unelected Irvine appoints to guard our human rights. It was at the Commercial Court that Irvine acquired the deep gravitas and awesome bottom which allowed him to boast he was the reincarnation of 'Cardinal Wolsey' running a 'hugely important' 'Star Chamber' that determined the legislative programme.</p> <p>He made a small fortune representing Mohamed al- Fayed and Hong Kong businesses. Occasionally, he drew admiring purrs from legal London by hitting that revered \u00a31-million-a year target. But as Dominic Egan writes in his spirited biography ( Irvine , Mainstream Publishing), one of the 'huge myths about Irvine's legal career _ is that [he] was one of the best barristers in the business'. He was good - you do not accumulate a hoard of Sickerts, Spencers and Nashes if you're a dunderhead. Yet there was too much pomp about him, too great an anxiety to stick to a plan he had sweated over in advance, for Irvine to be a great advocate. Unexpected evidence could throw him, as his nimbler courtroom rivals knew.</p> <p>His Eminence never matched the skills or fees of the super-rich silks. A successful barrister working for a corporate client will make a paltry \u00a3350-\u00a3500 an hour. Anthony Grabiner and the other stars of the Bar receive \u00a3800 (excluding extras), the Lawyer magazine reported. 'Your case must be worth at least \u00a3100m if you want to instruct this lot,' one of their clerks said. Grabiner was ennobled by New Labour. He makes \u00a3200 more in an hour than the minimum wage delivers in a month. The House of Lords, his chambers and the Hendon Golf and Garrick clubs where he passes his days are as far as one can imagine from the miseries of life in the slums.</p> <p>Last year, the Tories demanded it should be made more miserable still in their unhinged Common Sense Revolution. The black economy must be restricted by forcing the unemployed to sign on every day. The workless who lived miles from a benefit office would see a slice of their tiny incomes frittered away on bus fares. All would waste time when they might be looking for a job.</p> <p>New Labour responded with a rare Left critique. Jeff Rooker, Labour's Social Security Minister, said daily reporting to the DSS was 'right-wing madness'. On 26 October, David Blunkett was asked in the Commons if he could cost the petty piece of viciousness. He could: 25,000 staff would have to be hired at a cost of \u00a3400m a year. Two days later, Blunkett revealed that the price of howling Conservatism was rising by the minute. 'It would cost \u00a3540m a year,' he replied to a second planted question. The money could be far better spent giving the unemployed the 'skills necessary to hold down jobs'.</p> <p>On 9 November, Gordon Brown transformed insanity into prudence with a wave of his jowls. He announced an investigation of welfare fraud to discover if claimants suspected of - but not convicted of - working illegally should be forced to report daily. Lord Grabiner, New Labour's new peer, was ready to oblige him.</p> <p>Many lawyers say that Grabiner is a brilliant barrister and a pleasant fellow. I found him an open and engaging man when he returned a call. When all the polite caveats have been made, however, he has produced a weak piece of work. He says that those suspected of fraud should report regularly to benefit offices, but he doesn't say how often or answer Blunkett's worries.</p> <p>What motivates him is a determination to hit fraud hard. Now fraud discredits the welfare state. It allowed the Sun to scream 'Fleeced: The Scandal of Britain's Scroungers and Dole Cheats' when Grabiner's report was released earlier this month. (The paper didn't mention that its owner, Rupert Murdoch, who also controls the Times , Sunday Times , News of the World and BSkyB, has employed the best tax lawyers around and left his simple readers to find the \u00a31.4 billion of British corporation tax he has dodged since 1988.)</p> <p>Grabiner says that a survey by the Benefit Office estimated that 120,000 were working while claiming benefit - although most, presumably, were not netting \u00a3800 an hour. Estimates of fraud are notoriously vague. In 1997, the DSS asserted regularly that one in eight disabled people was on the fiddle. A Benefit Integrity Project scared tens of thousands by ordering them to submit to new medical examinations. At the end of a year of prying, not one scrounger had been uncovered.</p> <p>Even if his estimates are rightish, doesn't the case still have to be proved? Apparently not. Offenders on probation will lose all benefits when they are accused of breaking court orders. Grabiner will order claimants to benefit offices when they are suspected of being frauds. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by the lazy authoritarianism. The principles of the presumption of innocence and trial by jury are not in the bones of the Blairite briefs. Why should we expect them to know how to behave?</p> <p><b>New Labour abolishes the pound</b><br>They're coming. The grasping foreigners. The economic migrants. The sly ones who suck money out of old England, send it abroad and laugh behind their hands at us all the way to their bank.</p> <p>Not asylum-seekers, but Sodexho, the French company which will begin on All Fools' Day printing and distributing the 50p, \u00a31 and \u00a35 vouchers that compose the Asylo, Europe's newest and most debased coinage .</p> <p>Sodexho will not reveal how much profit it will make. Jack Straw showed the hauteur of a Eurocrat when he told the Commons that the payments to Sodexho from public funds were a secret. ('The contractual details are commercially confidential.') All we are allowed to know is that the cost of abolishing the pound and imposing an alien currency is far greater than paying cash benefits.</p> <p>The point is to push below the poverty line those who have been waiting years for successive Home Secretaries to manage their department and make decisions on their cases, and to deter others from flying to Heathrow. A single man will have to live on \u00a335 a week. A family of four will get \u00a3110. As the supermarkets are not allowed to give them change in coins of the realm - they might spend them on phone calls and other fripperies - begging will be a tempting option. Then, if I understand Ann Widdecombe and Barbara Roche correctly, they'll be incarcerated because asking for charity is so hideous an offence in the new Britain that supplicants must suffer for their cheek.</p> <p>Like the Euro, the Asylo is a studied insult to Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen. No Windsor bonce will appear on the vouchers. It will be a corporate currency featuring a hologram in which the initials SP (Sodexho Pass) will float on an intricate arrangement of colours to prevent forgery.</p> <p>A black market, however, is unstoppable as Asylos are traded below their face value for the pennies the supermarket cartel can't pinch.</p> <p>Sodexho was once only a caterer. Then it learned that the Anglo-American political class is good for all kinds of strange new business ventures. Sodexho has moved out of supplying buns and bought a stake in the Corrections Corporation of America. Straw, who I remember deploring private prisons, has given the corporation two British jails.</p> <p>In 1998, Sodhexo took over an American services company called Marriott. Employees were not allowed to form a union.They were banned from talking to outsiders or even their colleagues about working conditions. Sodexho had to relent when the US Labour Relations Board condemned the suppression of free speech as unconstitutional. But the firm managed to run strike-breaking operations in New England hospitals last year.</p> <p>Straw isn't launching the Asylo with a business partner, but an ideological soulmate.</p>",

As the supermarkets are not allowed to give them change in coins of the realm - they might spend them on phone calls and other fripperies - begging will be a tempting option. Then, if I understand Ann Widdecombe and Barbara Roche correctly, they'll be incarcerated because asking for charity is so hideous an offence in the new Britain that supplicants must suffer for their cheek. Like the Euro, the Asylo is a studied insult to Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen. No Windsor bonce will appear on the vouchers. It will be a corporate currency featuring a hologram in which the initials SP (Sodexho Pass) will float on an intricate arrangement of colours to prevent forgery. A black market, however, is unstoppable as Asylos are traded below their face value for the pennies the supermarket cartel can't pinch. Sodexho was once only a caterer. Then it learned that the Anglo-American political class is good for all kinds of strange new business ventures. Sodexho has moved out of supplying buns and bought a stake in the Corrections Corporation of America. Straw, who I remember deploring private prisons, has given the corporation two British jails. In 1998, Sodhexo took over an American services company called Marriott. Employees were not allowed to form a union.They were banned from talking to outsiders or even their colleagues about working conditions. Sodexho had to relent when the US Labour Relations Board condemned the suppression of free speech as unconstitutional. But the firm managed to run strike-breaking operations in New England hospitals last year. Straw isn't launching the Asylo with a business partner, but an ideological soulmate.",

Such hopes trail the Pope as he makes his pilgrim's progress, which culminates today in a visit to the great shrines of all three faiths in old Jerusalem. The twisted streets of the holy city could vex the patience of any man trying to preach reconciliation - especially the Pope, whose every step last week was a victory over ill health and old age.

      "body": "<p>There is nothing like the city on a warm summer night. Despite the petrol stink, somehow the tangy, exciting smell of greenery and flowers hangs in the street; people seem friendlier - informal micro-carnivals outside the pubs and couples chewing one another under the streetlamps. In central London this week for the opening of Tate Britain, I found myself adopting the slow, contented, living-is-easy lope of summertime. And then I thought - hold on, but it's March.</p> <p>Yet again, we have missed the winter. Across much of the country there has been only a pseudo-winter of warm sunlight, muggy skies, erupting bulbs, confused insects and early blossom. Those whose job it is to take notes say England and Wales have had the sunniest winter since records began, though it's been punctuated by some dramatic downpours too. Overall, the 1990s was the warmest decade on record; and last year was the hottest year. And this, of course, is only the beginning; if you click on to the simulated globes at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, you see a frightening-looking sequence of blue and green (for cool) spheres giving way to hot red ones in the years ahead.</p> <p>The official prediction is for the global average temperature to rise by three degrees by the 2080s, with massive effects across the planet. Stabilising carbon emissions would slow that by perhaps half a century but, despite the 1997 Kyoto accord, there is precious little sign of the movements needed around the world to make that likely.</p> <p>Hardly anyone denies global warming is happening, though there is still a loud debate about the extent to which it is caused by human industrialisation, the growth of mega-cities and the 'great car economy'. No one seems to know for sure about rising sea-levels. There is an interesting controversy centred on the Isle of the Dead, a convict cemetery-island off Tasmania, where in 1841 a British captain and an amateur meteorologist carved a standard Ordnance Survey mark of the tide, still clearly visible - leading John Daly, a global warming dissenter, to declare that 'there has been no sea-level rise this century, none at all'. Others say he's simply misread the meaning of the OS benchmark.</p> <p>But the precautionary principle alone suggests that action to stop the growth of carbon emissions is one of the prime challenges mankind faces. Never before have we experimented so blithely and on so vast a scale with the planet's system. Never before has political leadership on such a great question - in the US particularly - been so pitifully weak. If it happens that, by the time today's children are elderly, Africa has turned into a vast desert, and three billion people don't have enough water, and island-states have disappeared, then perhaps those living through it will reflect on the deadly weakness of Western democracy, a system that could not say 'no' to consumers. How natural are most of today's so-called natural disasters?</p> <p>This is an area where we can raise two cheers at least for our own Government, one of the most active in Europe and therefore the world in setting tough targets and taking action to reduce our outputs of carbon dioxide, methane and the other greenhouse gases. John Prescott has been far more effective than most of his opposite numbers and is a bit of an unsung hero on the issue - the third cheer is missing because it seemed very much a Brown Budget last week, not a Green one.</p> <p>But as Prescott launches an awareness campaign on global warming, the really striking thing is how little discussion there has been about how it's going to alter us, the British. For it will. There are the obvious changes, fairly well understood. A recent report from a group of Oxford scientists to Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, suggested that the new climate would bring an England of sweetcorn and sunflower fields, peaches and nectarines, berries and runner beans. Harvest festivals, apparently, may have to be moved from the autumn to the summer or even the late spring; traditional vegetables like turnips would become rare; but we will grow more cereals. It can sound pretty good - an England of Anglo-Tuscans, sitting around comparing vintages of fine Hampshire and Shropshire wines. Then there are the threats to buildings and lifestyles if, as expected, we get more extreme weather. They range from the flooding of low-lying land to the drying up of clay and massive subsidence problems for housing built there. Not much to be done about that. And the health threats. And the political threats - mass migrations, water wars abroad - which in turn affect the way we see the wider world.</p> <p>Next, if the scientists are right, there will be greater climatic (therefore social and cultural) variations between the different parts of the UK. The North will be far wetter, the South hotter. Perhaps the English seaside holiday will become trendy and expensive as France and Spain are simply too hot and dry for comfort. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the North-West Highlands have been so wet in the past few months that, according to my parents' neighbours 'even the sheep are getting depressed'.</p> <p>And then there will be the other cultural effects of a warmer South - not simply the caf\u00e9 culture but changes in clothing and architectural fashions, food and leisure. More cycling, perhaps, and less brown beer and roasts and puddings, and a winter cricket season. Already, the traditional winter is something foreign to many British children. For the first two months of this year, barely any snow fell in lowland Britain and that is part of a pattern that, according to researchers at East Anglia University, is now well-established.</p> <p>Less snow and ice means the jettisoning also of a lot of artistic and psychological freight. Somewhere inside, most of us are still trained to think of a seasonal cycle, part of which involves snowy landscapes, frost-crusted woods, icicles, frozen ponds. There is a primitive morality tale in it - after the penance of winter, the reward of spring. But this is all becoming folk-memory; the old photos in the family album of the thick post-war snowfalls, negotiated by people in thick woollen coats, seem as far-removed as pictures of peasants with scythes. I don't want to seem wet-eyed about this. Since most people I know are happier when the sun is shining, then it's perfectly possible that climate change may make the British happier generally - we may become more open and optimistic than we used to be, the glad recipients of atmospheric Prozac. But it's not necessarily the case. The displacement of old seasonal certainties takes us further away from our own history and culture. It unsettles, too.</p> <p>Without the old winters, a lot of our seasonal poems, rhymes and novels don't make sense. Would 'Lear' or the opening scenes of Hamlet have been written without the biting cold of the 'little ice age' of Shakespearean England? Pickwick in an open-necked shirt? Like the harvest festivals, much else is uprooted, or seems wrongly placed; spring pushed closer back to Christmas, trees looking dark and dusty by June. We ceased to be a rural people, of course, before anyone else in the world.

      "bodyText": "There is nothing like the city on a warm summer night. Despite the petrol stink, somehow the tangy, exciting smell of greenery and flowers hangs in the street; people seem friendlier - informal micro-carnivals outside the pubs and couples chewing one another under the streetlamps. In central London this week for the opening of Tate Britain, I found myself adopting the slow, contented, living-is-easy lope of summertime. And then I thought - hold on, but it's March. Yet again, we have missed the winter. Across much of the country there has been only a pseudo-winter of warm sunlight, muggy skies, erupting bulbs, confused insects and early blossom. Those whose job it is to take notes say England and Wales have had the sunniest winter since records began, though it's been punctuated by some dramatic downpours too. Overall, the 1990s was the warmest decade on record; and last year was the hottest year. And this, of course, is only the beginning; if you click on to the simulated globes at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, you see a frightening-looking sequence of blue and green (for cool) spheres giving way to hot red ones in the years ahead. The official prediction is for the global average temperature to rise by three degrees by the 2080s, with massive effects across the planet. Stabilising carbon emissions would slow that by perhaps half a century but, despite the 1997 Kyoto accord, there is precious little sign of the movements needed around the world to make that likely. Hardly anyone denies global warming is happening, though there is still a loud debate about the extent to which it is caused by human industrialisation, the growth of mega-cities and the 'great car economy'. No one seems to know for sure about rising sea-levels. There is an interesting controversy centred on the Isle of the Dead, a convict cemetery-island off Tasmania, where in 1841 a British captain and an amateur meteorologist carved a standard Ordnance Survey mark of the tide, still clearly visible - leading John Daly, a global warming dissenter, to declare that 'there has been no sea-level rise this century, none at all'. Others say he's simply misread the meaning of the OS benchmark. But the precautionary principle alone suggests that action to stop the growth of carbon emissions is one of the prime challenges mankind faces. Never before have we experimented so blithely and on so vast a scale with the planet's system. Never before has political leadership on such a great question - in the US particularly - been so pitifully weak. If it happens that, by the time today's children are elderly, Africa has turned into a vast desert, and three billion people don't have enough water, and island-states have disappeared, then perhaps those living through it will reflect on the deadly weakness of Western democracy, a system that could not say 'no' to consumers. How natural are most of today's so-called natural disasters? This is an area where we can raise two cheers at least for our own Government, one of the most active in Europe and therefore the world in setting tough targets and taking action to reduce our outputs of carbon dioxide, methane and the other greenhouse gases. John Prescott has been far more effective than most of his opposite numbers and is a bit of an unsung hero on the issue - the third cheer is missing because it seemed very much a Brown Budget last week, not a Green one. But as Prescott launches an awareness campaign on global warming, the really striking thing is how little discussion there has been about how it's going to alter us, the British. For it will. There are the obvious changes, fairly well understood. A recent report from a group of Oxford scientists to Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, suggested that the new climate would bring an England of sweetcorn and sunflower fields, peaches and nectarines, berries and runner beans. Harvest festivals, apparently, may have to be moved from the autumn to the summer or even the late spring; traditional vegetables like turnips would become rare; but we will grow more cereals. It can sound pretty good - an England of Anglo-Tuscans, sitting around comparing vintages of fine Hampshire and Shropshire wines. Then there are the threats to buildings and lifestyles if, as expected, we get more extreme weather. They range from the flooding of low-lying land to the drying up of clay and massive subsidence problems for housing built there. Not much to be done about that. And the health threats. And the political threats - mass migrations, water wars abroad - which in turn affect the way we see the wider world. Next, if the scientists are right, there will be greater climatic (therefore social and cultural) variations between the different parts of the UK. The North will be far wetter, the South hotter. Perhaps the English seaside holiday will become trendy and expensive as France and Spain are simply too hot and dry for comfort. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the North-West Highlands have been so wet in the past few months that, according to my parents' neighbours 'even the sheep are getting depressed'. And then there will be the other cultural effects of a warmer South - not simply the caf\u00e9 culture but changes in clothing and architectural fashions, food and leisure. More cycling, perhaps, and less brown beer and roasts and puddings, and a winter cricket season. Already, the traditional winter is something foreign to many British children. For the first two months of this year, barely any snow fell in lowland Britain and that is part of a pattern that, according to researchers at East Anglia University, is now well-established. Less snow and ice means the jettisoning also of a lot of artistic and psychological freight. Somewhere inside, most of us are still trained to think of a seasonal cycle, part of which involves snowy landscapes, frost-crusted woods, icicles, frozen ponds. There is a primitive morality tale in it - after the penance of winter, the reward of spring. But this is all becoming folk-memory; the old photos in the family album of the thick post-war snowfalls, negotiated by people in thick woollen coats, seem as far-removed as pictures of peasants with scythes. I don't want to seem wet-eyed about this. Since most people I know are happier when the sun is shining, then it's perfectly possible that climate change may make the British happier generally - we may become more open and optimistic than we used to be, the glad recipients of atmospheric Prozac. But it's not necessarily the case. The displacement of old seasonal certainties takes us further away from our own history and culture. It unsettles, too. Without the old winters, a lot of our seasonal poems, rhymes and novels don't make sense. Would 'Lear' or the opening scenes of Hamlet have been written without the biting cold of the 'little ice age' of Shakespearean England? Pickwick in an open-necked shirt? Like the harvest festivals, much else is uprooted, or seems wrongly placed; spring pushed closer back to Christmas, trees looking dark and dusty by June. We ceased to be a rural people, of course, before anyone else in the world. But with these climate changes, a thick reference-book connecting past Britons to present ones is being torn up, page by page. For instance, in the new Tate Britain where my amble ended, walking among paintings which are themselves familiar, it's possible to feel a colder, rougher, emptier island which is unfamiliar. Romantic water-colours, Stubbses, wintry Constables, Pre-Raphaelite fantasias, heavily-dressed Victorians, Ford Madox Brown's soft 'Hayfield' at Hendon, Laura Knight's stunning evocation of spring in Cornwall... they are glimpses, reminders, of another country. Climate change is now fact, not idea. It also means people change and social change and political change, though there is remarkably little writing on all that yet. Perhaps because we experience it through the distracting medley of daily life, inconsistently and contingently, and because it happens on a scale and timescale far removed from electoral cycles, and we feel helpless, it has barely touched politics or the national conversation. But there is a connection between how we in the West live and work and what's happening to the world's climate. Elsewhere, billions are potentially threatened; and only political action can help. We all know this. It is the omnipresent, obvious truth that barely dares speak. We should shiver in this warmth.",

      "bodyText": "The telephone calls are already coming in, with their polite, but insistent inquiries: 'What date is the launch party, again? I just want to make sure I'm free.' The 2,500 invitations to the celebratory opening night at the Tate Modern, on 11 May, have not been sent out yet. But it is clear that the event will eclipse other 'big bash' openings across the capital, such as the Royal Opera House rebirth. Thursday night's glamorous relaunch party at the Tate Britain on Millbank was just a warm-up for the main event. 'There has been an amazing pressure on us to get tickets for people,' said one of the Tate's team. 'The new building at Bankside and last week's launch mean that everyone knows the big one is coming up.' Ever since the Sensation exhibition of young British artists came to the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1997, visual arts in this country have been hot. Neither the opera nor the ballet have a chance of competing for attention. As Thursday's party showed, modern art draws the really big stars. Almost 2,000 guests piled into the Tate Gallery's original home at Millbank to mark its transformation into Tate Britain, a newly organised collection that will house works by British artists. The country's most prominent artists, Gary Hume, Antony Gormley, Julian Opie and Tracey Emin, were joined by leading politicians, film directors, musicians, actors, and, of course, Madonna, the crowning jewel in the publicist's crown. 'The associations between rock and modern art have always been there, but they are stronger than ever now,' said Opie, who has designed the band St Etienne's latest album cover and is about to work with the singer Bj\u00f6rk. 'There is a real interest in design and shape generally, and it is great to feel modern art is no longer an embarrassing joke that gets an easy laugh. That was such a stale, boring idea. There are often paparazzi at openings now and that can be unhealthy when it means the same artists are written about to the point when the public becomes bored with them.' The \u00a3134m Tate Bankside, an entirely new museum built inside the vast shell of a disused power station, houses the Tate's international twentieth and twenty-first century collection. 'It is very unusual for an art museum of this size to open anywhere in the world,' said Jill Sil verman, chief executive of the influential Lissom Gallery. 'I actually think this is one thing that deserves all the hype it gets. It is going to be the centre of artistic research and education for years to come.' The opening evening will be televised live by the BBC. The broadcast, presented by Kirsty Wark and Matthew Collings, will climax in a rock concert and a specially commissioned dance performance. Once open, the Tate Modern will gain a large chunk of its income from hiring out the gallery in the evening to its 17 corporate funding partners. The gallery is already booked until nearly the end of the year. To involve neighbours and the wider London community, the opening fortnight will involve a series of companion events, including an invitation to black cab drivers to an exclusive preview.",

It is going to take somebody like that because nobody is going to buy it as an investment.' With his office being bombarded by calls of support and sympathy from clan members around the world, the beleaguered 64-year-old chief also disclosed that he would consider donating the 35 acres of land to the public in return for state funding for repairs to Dunvegan, the MacLeod seat since the 12th century.</p> <p>Anchored on a rocky outcrop on the shore of a loch, the castle is the epitome of a Highland chieftain's stronghold.

The most urgent repairs will cost \u00a32.8m; those that are merely necessary will eat up another \u00a33.5m. Throw in \u00a31m for contingencies and a couple more for capital gains tax and that, says the chief, who has been unable to secure public help with his roof, leaves him no option but to sell the Cuillins.

The scheme has been in the pipeline for some time and is well advanced: detailed plans have been submitted to the local authority and planning permission was recently renewed. All that is needed is the cash, prompting accusations that the Cuillins sale is about more than a leaky roof.</p> <p>But MacLeod said that if public money was made available just to pay for the new roof, he would consider handing over the Cuillins to the nation.

'If the repairs could be covered then an arrangement about the land would be possible,' he said. 'I would not sell the Cuillins just to build a hotel.' Neither this nor the celebrity solution, however, has appeased critics of the sell-off, led by Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles. 'The castle roof is totally irrelevant,' he said. 'The question is: does he have any moral right whatever to sell a unique area like the Cuillins to the highest bidder, and I don't believe he does. It is not his land.

And the good news is that there is a cure.</p> <p>Testosterone replacement therapy is now becoming recognised as a suitable treatment for what has been until now dismissed as a mid-life crisis rather than a serious medical condition.</p> <p>Men, like women, suffer a drop in hormone levels as they age. In men the hormone is testosterone. Many men, and many GPs, will dismiss their symptoms as natural ageing, but last week the British Medical Journal revealed that there was a strong argument that the male menopause - called the andropause - does exist. Now The Observer can reveal the little-known fact that a treatment is available. The UK is the only country in the world where safe, oral tablets of TRT are available.</p> <p>Fifty-something men can recover their lost youth, tired businessmen can find their killer instinct once more, beer bellies can be reduced and sex lives can be rejuvenated.</p> <p>One group of Harley Street doctors is so convinced of the value of testosterone replacement therapy, and so frustrated by GPs' unwillingness to prescribe it, that they are launching a cyber-clinic, an online consultancy for men suffering from an age-related drop in testosterone levels.</p> <p>Stress, alcohol intake and even environmental hormone disrupters are all causing an increase in the number of sufferers. Andropause hits high flyers, those with naturally high testosterone levels, hardest of all.</p> <p>Bernard Collen, 54, credits the drug with having saved his marriage and his career. Ten years ago he was an irritable, exhausted salesman who put his lack of sex drive and bad temper down to the stress of his job. 'I really felt I was starting to lose my grip,' he said.

      "bodyText": "Sybil Fawlty memorably blamed Basil's eccentric behaviour on his 'time of life' - but the joke is a miserable medical reality for millions of men suffering lack of drive at work, loss of libido or impotence, depression, irritability, night sweats and hot flushes. And the good news is that there is a cure. Testosterone replacement therapy is now becoming recognised as a suitable treatment for what has been until now dismissed as a mid-life crisis rather than a serious medical condition. Men, like women, suffer a drop in hormone levels as they age. In men the hormone is testosterone. Many men, and many GPs, will dismiss their symptoms as natural ageing, but last week the British Medical Journal revealed that there was a strong argument that the male menopause - called the andropause - does exist. Now The Observer can reveal the little-known fact that a treatment is available. The UK is the only country in the world where safe, oral tablets of TRT are available. Fifty-something men can recover their lost youth, tired businessmen can find their killer instinct once more, beer bellies can be reduced and sex lives can be rejuvenated. One group of Harley Street doctors is so convinced of the value of testosterone replacement therapy, and so frustrated by GPs' unwillingness to prescribe it, that they are launching a cyber-clinic, an online consultancy for men suffering from an age-related drop in testosterone levels. Stress, alcohol intake and even environmental hormone disrupters are all causing an increase in the number of sufferers. Andropause hits high flyers, those with naturally high testosterone levels, hardest of all. Bernard Collen, 54, credits the drug with having saved his marriage and his career. Ten years ago he was an irritable, exhausted salesman who put his lack of sex drive and bad temper down to the stress of his job. 'I really felt I was starting to lose my grip,' he said. It was his wife, Michelle, who heard of the UK Andropause Clinic and the pioneering work being done by Dr Malcolm Carruthers at the Gold Cross Medical Group in London's Harley Street. 'She rang him up and just forced the phone into my hand,' said Bernard. A blood test confirmed he had low testosterone and he was prescribed TRT. 'My life turned around. It restored my ability to do my job, it boosted my sexual desire, it seemed to give me better mental agility and the depression went overnight,' he said. Dr Carruthers and his colleagues have been voices in the medical wilderness for 10 years, in which time more than 1,000 men have been treated with TRT at his clinic, and the group is now launching an interactive AndroScreen website. This means that men unhappy with their GP's advice can turn to the Internet for a medical appraisal. Dr Carruthers believes he has convinced many other doctors that TRT is the way forward. 'All the evidence that has come forward, particularly over the past year, shows that the andropause is a real and serious condition,' he said.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is a clicheacute; of quite unforgiveable proportions to use the adjective 'husky' when describing Mariella Frostrup. As soon as the word looms the senses simply have to rebel against the tedious inevitability of its appearance; it's like coming across the word 'quintessential' in an article about David Niven, or (presumably) looking in the mirror if you are Andrew Lloyd-Webber and thinking of the word 'ugly.' And we are living whap bam in the middle of a clich\u00e9 - we are sitting in the bar of the Groucho Club. The air is being kissed with such fierce frequency that were it a person it would amount to rape. Pashminas exist. We have stepped over a beggar to get in. We are sipping wine. It is white - I vow, there and then, to plough through ever-deeper adjectival seams for an elegant solution.</p> <p>So. Mariella Frostrup, whose voice reminds me of an Arctic sled-beast of the genus canus, is getting angry. Not just for herself, but on general behalf of blond women with brains. Women such as Jerry Hall, who had a few months ago to suffer the schoolboy jokes that get made when England's male intellectuals leave the classroom for the playground. Jerry's crime, apart from being blond and a woman, was to have been picked as a judge for the Whitbread Book Award, as Mariella's is now to have been chosen as a panellist for this year's Booker. Comparisons have been made, of course; and the expected cries of 'dumbing down' have followed. Mariella is A Woman. Her hair is fair-coloured. Her face is not that of a smuggler's dog, and her body is not noticeably covered in stringwarts. Therefore, ergo, she is Thick As Shit and not fit to judge Britain's premier literary award.</p> <p>'I hated all that meanness against Jerry, all that sniping, stuff about time at the hairdressers. I know that I was just as keen to find out what books Jerry had enjoyed as had, for instance, Melvyn Bragg, or whoever. And I'm sure Melvyn and Jerry spend an equal amount of time at the hairdresser's \u0085</p> <p>'But even then the comparisons between her and me are crap. Jerry's a 44-year-old mother of four who's fought her way up quite brilliantly from Hicksville. I'm a single 37-year-old journalist. What on earth do we have in common, apart from being women and not being famous academics? 'Also, also - ' \u0085she is warming to her theme now, which means she smokes more quickly, moves seats to face me directly and get away from the mirror ('I hate looking at myself in mirrors') and her voice drops in timbre until it resembles a whole pack of rasping harnessed polar tent-pullers - 'it's part of the problem with so much of our culture; someone out there seems to want to foster that you should do it - read that book, watch that film - because it's \"good for you\". Which is precisely the wrong attitude, and must put people off; why can't we just be told that something's brilliant, and therefore we should get on with enjoying it?'</p> <p>Which is, she says, how she was brought up, in Norway and then, after the age of six, Ireland 'Reading was never a chore, it was a joy. We weren't allowed telly except on a Saturday night; we read, and loved it. I can still remember the excitement. I can still remember, very early on, my dad coming home with a copy of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, and the sense of happiness. I've always loved reading; it's one thing I do well.'</p> <p>She talks of some of her favourites - Tim Winton, Graham Greene, Don DeLillo. Some Rushdie, particularly The Moor's Last Sigh. Disgrace. Her South American period. During her disquisition on recent literary fads, talk turns to Bridget Jones, and she halts. 'Now that, too, was a good book. In fact, that was a great book. But not a Booker book.'</p> <p>But why not? If it was popular, and made people laugh, and made people think, and was a good book, why shouldn't it be considered as such by our literary minders - especially given Mariella's earlier lit-snob arguments?</p> <p>'Oh, I know, it's difficult.' She sighs. 'But it's not a Booker book, books like that aren't. I really think they have to be about big themes; themes that reflect the human condition, not just one part of it.</p> <p>'You know, also, one other reason I get angry at people who snipe, is this: I'm proud to be asked to be on the panel. I'm really looking forward to it, and in many ways I don't care what people say. I think five years ago I would have been embarrassed and upset. But less so now. Maybe, finally, I'm growing up.'</p> <p>If she is, she says, it will be the second time. 'I grew up pretty fast when I was young. I was precocious. But then\u0085 well, I moved to London at 16, and sometimes it's been a bit of a blur. It feels like I've been racing headlong with blinkers on for a bit too long. Now, finally, I think I'd like to slow down a bit, and I'm ready to do the things I love; reading, and travelling.'</p> <p>A music-business PR hot and hip off the ferry from Dublin, she saw the world, found a rock star husband (Richard Jobson, now ex - in both categories), waltzed into telly, and walked into a million Soho sound-studios to voice a generation of adverts with her famous dog-voice. In the annals of sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, she freely admits, she leaves Ann Widdecombe standing.</p> <p>'It was fun, but \u0085 was it worth it? Yes, but \u0085' I ask about the best things the dizzy years had brought her, the time as a PR, networking and schmoozing through the Thatcher years; the years as mini-celeb. The years when Mariella and a few dozen others, charming though they all may have been in person (and she is funny and kind and all the rest) seemed to be single-handedly keeping the Brown Economy alive, i.e. bullshit in its many and not particularly varied forms. She thinks for a while. 'Um \u0085 getting tables in restaurants. Yes. Definitely that. And \u0085 being recognised in the street. And \u0085 Christ. Yes. Fuck. You're right.</p> <p>'But\u0085 look, I wasn't wholly driven by a need for fame. Also, I haven't that many regrets. Some of the TV stuff \u0085 okay some of that was a touch tacky. But there are limits. I said no to Hello! when they offered me \u00a330,000 to come inside my beautiful home. Okay, I do a film column for the News of the Screws - but I'd rather it was me doing it, pushing good films, than someone else pushing the latest Arnie blockbuster.' I am intrigued about her drive; if not fame, then what? She grows rather quiet.</p> <p>'Money. Security. I've always needed that, always needed to know I could provide for myself. I've never really felt financially secure, always been worried about it. You see \u0085 we never had much.' But what happened to the money coming in from her father, a respected foreign editor of the Irish Times ?</p> <p>'He drank it. Pretty well drank it all.' Living the stereotype to the end - fearless, clever Irish hack - he drank himself to death at the age of 44. 'I don't ever remember him without a bottle of Soave. And I don't ever remember ever being sadder, in my life, than when he died.'</p> <p>And now, finally, she says she's growing up, again; and she has the Booker job to prove it. 'I'm also more at peace intellectually. The older I get, the more people I meet, the more I realise it's people's talent and capacity for thought that counts more than anything.'</p> <p>Fulfilled, and confident - but she would, she says, like to be in love. She smiles fondly as I ask when she was happiest, and answers 'When I was 10. I fell in love with the postmistress's son in Connemarra. What a lovely summer\u0085' But real love, grown-up love, she shrugs, still eludes her. 'And it's not me doing the dumping. They always dump me. But\u0085 who knows. Yes\u0085 I'd love to meet someone.'</p> <p>As we leave, with her fretting about the number of books she has to read for the Booker - six a week, and she's going to be monstrously thorough, she says - she wonders what it will be like meeting the other Booker judges. 'Simon Jenkins,' she asks; 'What's he like? Will I hate him?' No, of course not, I answer, thinking that this isn't the question I might have expected. Five years ago, I suspect, with a different, insecure Mariella, ditzy darling of the PR set, I suspect I wouldn't have liked her so much. And the question would have been 'Will he hate me?'</p>",

The Observer can reveal that BNFL wants to get rid of 1,400 out of the 4,300 staff at the highly sensitive site near Aldermaston, with a tenth of the workforce being sacked in the first few months. Local MPs, residents, trade unions and anti-nuclear groups have reacted with outrage. They believe the job losses will severely compromise the safety at the factory, which makes Britain's Trident nuclear weapons. BNFL's safety record is already facing heavy criticism after revelations that it deliberately faked safety data at its nuclear reprocessing operations at Sellafield in Cumbria. The future of that site is now in jeopardy. The Observer has obtained internal documents from the Environment Agency, one of the bodies which will monitor BNFL at Aldermaston, that shows its senior staff are worried about BNFL's ability to run the plant. In December, a BNFL-led consortium won a 10-year \u00a32.2bn contract to take over Aldermaston from 1 April. This followed a catalogue of serious safety and environmental breaches at the plant. For the last seven years, Aldermaston has been run by Anglo-American consortium Hunting Brae, which cut 2,000 jobs since 1993. Some experts believe only luck prevented a major nuclear accident at the site and the Environment Agency recently prosecuted the management for illegal radioactive discharges into the Thames. Trade unions at Aldermaston were informed of BNFL's plans last week and believe that slashing the workforce will escalate these breaches.

A spokesman for the BNFL-led consortium said: 'Safety is paramount to us and we will ensure there will be enough staff to operate the site safely and efficiently.' The MoD said it had warned last November that 1,400 jobs could be cut over the next 10 years, most through natural wastage and with no safety implications. Yet minutes from a board meeting of the Environment Agency on 5 March say: 'Recently there have been a number of incidents at BNFL sites which have led the agency to question seriously the competence of BNFL's management of radioactive waste and its commitment to environmental protection.' antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "trailText": "Louise Clifford has followed her father into the family PR business. It's not the most obvious platform from which to champion good causes, says  Sarah Ryle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Louise Clifford looks just like her mother. She is petite and pretty, with a little nose and nice if wary eyes. But it is her father, PR guru Max, whom she aspires to be and whose unexpectedly quiet, ultra-polite manner she displays. She oozes adoration for him. He is her role model and has been her rock through her growing years as she handled the debilitating disease rheumatoid arthritis. Now he is also her boss.</p> <p>At last week's British Press Awards ('the Oscars of the newspaper industry'), Louise joined the team from the News of the World while her parents supped with the pack from Harrods. 'They asked my dad but he was already going, so they got me instead,' Louise beams. She doesn't seem to mind being second choice. Unlike some children of famous people, she is happy to stand firmly in her father's shadow. She is, as she says, still learning her trade.</p> <p>'I'd rather be known as Louise the daughter of Max Clifford, who is making a career in PR, than Louise the champion for disabled rights,' she admits. Which is bad news, in a sense, for Scope, the 'national disability organisation whose focus is people with cerebral palsy'. Scope has just published Stop Press! - a survey of words and pictures used to describe disability. They asked Louise to be interviewed in order to raise the report's profile. It should be right up her street because it highlights the 'appalling' way disability is handled. In 1,000 references to disability one month last year in national daily newspapers, 800 were deemed 'offensive' or 'discriminatory'.</p> <p>As someone who had to use a wheelchair until she was 15, who also is more media savvy than most, Louise ought to be the ideal spokeswoman. Far from sticking to the points raised by Stop Press!, though, she seems more comfortable talking about her job and her life as Max's daughter. Louise is 28, and 18 months into her working life. She has been propelled to the giddy heights (or, some would say, depths) of Max Clifford's Planet Tabloid with just a year of hard experience and a three-year degree at Bournemouth in communications.</p> <p>The Charlottes and Alexanders who currently churn out fodder for City PR firms may sneer at Max Clifford Associates, but they'd be fools. Clifford has cornered the market in lucrative dosh-for-dirt stories. He is a household name. He is, probably, the best at what he does.</p> <p>'I can pick up the phone and give my name and editors will talk to me. That doesn't happen to most people,' she states. Louise states most things. There isn't enough expression in her quiet, measured voice to say she boasts.</p> <p>It is Max's domination of the juicy tales that has his daughter on first name terms with Piers (as in the Mirror's Morgan) and Phil (as in the News of the World's Hall). Is she excited? Not a bit of it. 'I've grown up answering the phone at weekends to these people,' she explains. She considers the notion that she is just another rich kid with a famous parent to ease her path into a stab-em-in-the-back competitive world, but not for long.</p> <p>'I don't mind,' she says. 'Why should I? I know I'm good at what I do although I'm still learning. My dad thinks that there is a real shortage of good people in PR. What's important is being creative, imaginative and working hard. I know what the competition is like and I'm not that impressed.'</p> <p>She is unusually unconcerned about what she should or should not say. She is happy to talk about her dad's most famous clients. Antonia de Sanchez, she who had the mattress-in-the-basement, Chelsea shirt-wearing affair with former Cabinet Minister David Mellor, 'hated every minute' of the publicity and had never sought it, apparently. 'The friend of David Mellor's who let him use his flat bugged the phone and there is no law against that,' explains Louise. 'He sold the story. It was never Antonia's doing.'</p> <p>Bu Max was there to guide her through it, as he was with Bienvenida Buck ('She loved all the publicity and she still rings Dad. She's hosting a TV show in Spain.') This brings us to the Clifford reputation: the common perception is that if there is scandal, there is Clifford. Jeffrey Archer's recent problems, Gary Glitter's ex-lover, the model who shoved a cream cake in Agriculture Minister Nick Brown's face. These are the most recent stories. But Louise insists that whatever the commentators say, the public loves her dad. 'People are really vociferous in their praise. They come up to him in the street and shake his hand.'</p> <p>Her dad, she says, warns people who bring their stories to him that they can expect massive exposure. He tells them to go away and think about it again.</p> <p>The measure of Clifford's fame is his recent appearance on the front page of the Mirror, wearing two black eyes after tackling some 'louts' after a debate at Cambridge University. This is exposure reserved for only the most household of names. Louise says she has always been very close to her father. Like her mother, he was always there. But it is her dad she talks about most. 'He never let me feel that I was just a disability, even though there was so much medical stuff and deformity around me. He always talked about my qualities.'</p> <p>She insists she didn't set out to follow in his footsteps, though: 'I questioned whether I should be doing something a bit more caring like teaching or counselling, but then again that would be a bit of a clich\u00e9 as well because you come up through the medical route and get to know hospitals and doctors and counsellors inside out.'</p> <p>Discrimination is something that she is so matter of fact about that the inference has to be she is alarmingly accustomed to it. She says she was bullied at her state school in Wimbledon and begged to be sent to a school where there were other disabled children.</p> <p>'I know some people say this is not helpful because it separates people out, but it made me feel more normal. At the mainstream school I felt physical disability was a problem they just couldn't deal with. If I'd had behavioural problems, they had people for that.' But the boarding school wasn't academic and hospital visits conspired to persuade Louise she wasn't either. 'I didn't do GCSEs, but I did go on to college to get A-levels and then did my degree. I wrote my dissertation on the way TV represents disability.' Ah yes. Disability in the media. Surely this was the moment to talk about the Scope report? When pushed, Louise has a view.</p> <p>'My first thought was that it seemed a shame that the report doesn't seem to find much improvement since the last one 10 years ago.

      "bodyText": "Louise Clifford looks just like her mother. She is petite and pretty, with a little nose and nice if wary eyes. But it is her father, PR guru Max, whom she aspires to be and whose unexpectedly quiet, ultra-polite manner she displays. She oozes adoration for him. He is her role model and has been her rock through her growing years as she handled the debilitating disease rheumatoid arthritis. Now he is also her boss. At last week's British Press Awards ('the Oscars of the newspaper industry'), Louise joined the team from the News of the World while her parents supped with the pack from Harrods. 'They asked my dad but he was already going, so they got me instead,' Louise beams. She doesn't seem to mind being second choice. Unlike some children of famous people, she is happy to stand firmly in her father's shadow. She is, as she says, still learning her trade. 'I'd rather be known as Louise the daughter of Max Clifford, who is making a career in PR, than Louise the champion for disabled rights,' she admits. Which is bad news, in a sense, for Scope, the 'national disability organisation whose focus is people with cerebral palsy'. Scope has just published Stop Press! - a survey of words and pictures used to describe disability. They asked Louise to be interviewed in order to raise the report's profile. It should be right up her street because it highlights the 'appalling' way disability is handled. In 1,000 references to disability one month last year in national daily newspapers, 800 were deemed 'offensive' or 'discriminatory'. As someone who had to use a wheelchair until she was 15, who also is more media savvy than most, Louise ought to be the ideal spokeswoman. Far from sticking to the points raised by Stop Press!, though, she seems more comfortable talking about her job and her life as Max's daughter. Louise is 28, and 18 months into her working life. She has been propelled to the giddy heights (or, some would say, depths) of Max Clifford's Planet Tabloid with just a year of hard experience and a three-year degree at Bournemouth in communications. The Charlottes and Alexanders who currently churn out fodder for City PR firms may sneer at Max Clifford Associates, but they'd be fools. Clifford has cornered the market in lucrative dosh-for-dirt stories. He is a household name. He is, probably, the best at what he does. 'I can pick up the phone and give my name and editors will talk to me. That doesn't happen to most people,' she states. Louise states most things. There isn't enough expression in her quiet, measured voice to say she boasts. It is Max's domination of the juicy tales that has his daughter on first name terms with Piers (as in the Mirror's Morgan) and Phil (as in the News of the World's Hall). Is she excited? Not a bit of it. 'I've grown up answering the phone at weekends to these people,' she explains. She considers the notion that she is just another rich kid with a famous parent to ease her path into a stab-em-in-the-back competitive world, but not for long. 'I don't mind,' she says. 'Why should I? I know I'm good at what I do although I'm still learning. My dad thinks that there is a real shortage of good people in PR. What's important is being creative, imaginative and working hard. I know what the competition is like and I'm not that impressed.' She is unusually unconcerned about what she should or should not say. She is happy to talk about her dad's most famous clients. Antonia de Sanchez, she who had the mattress-in-the-basement, Chelsea shirt-wearing affair with former Cabinet Minister David Mellor, 'hated every minute' of the publicity and had never sought it, apparently. 'The friend of David Mellor's who let him use his flat bugged the phone and there is no law against that,' explains Louise. 'He sold the story. It was never Antonia's doing.' Bu Max was there to guide her through it, as he was with Bienvenida Buck ('She loved all the publicity and she still rings Dad. She's hosting a TV show in Spain.') This brings us to the Clifford reputation: the common perception is that if there is scandal, there is Clifford. Jeffrey Archer's recent problems, Gary Glitter's ex-lover, the model who shoved a cream cake in Agriculture Minister Nick Brown's face. These are the most recent stories. But Louise insists that whatever the commentators say, the public loves her dad. 'People are really vociferous in their praise. They come up to him in the street and shake his hand.' Her dad, she says, warns people who bring their stories to him that they can expect massive exposure. He tells them to go away and think about it again. The measure of Clifford's fame is his recent appearance on the front page of the Mirror, wearing two black eyes after tackling some 'louts' after a debate at Cambridge University. This is exposure reserved for only the most household of names. Louise says she has always been very close to her father. Like her mother, he was always there. But it is her dad she talks about most. 'He never let me feel that I was just a disability, even though there was so much medical stuff and deformity around me. He always talked about my qualities.' She insists she didn't set out to follow in his footsteps, though: 'I questioned whether I should be doing something a bit more caring like teaching or counselling, but then again that would be a bit of a clich\u00e9 as well because you come up through the medical route and get to know hospitals and doctors and counsellors inside out.' Discrimination is something that she is so matter of fact about that the inference has to be she is alarmingly accustomed to it. She says she was bullied at her state school in Wimbledon and begged to be sent to a school where there were other disabled children. 'I know some people say this is not helpful because it separates people out, but it made me feel more normal. At the mainstream school I felt physical disability was a problem they just couldn't deal with. If I'd had behavioural problems, they had people for that.' But the boarding school wasn't academic and hospital visits conspired to persuade Louise she wasn't either. 'I didn't do GCSEs, but I did go on to college to get A-levels and then did my degree. I wrote my dissertation on the way TV represents disability.' Ah yes. Disability in the media. Surely this was the moment to talk about the Scope report? When pushed, Louise has a view. 'My first thought was that it seemed a shame that the report doesn't seem to find much improvement since the last one 10 years ago. It surprised me because I've grown up in a period when the disability movement has got more and more organised. So you think other people are becoming more aware but you realise they are not.' Nevertheless, one of Louise's closest friends is Jane Campbell, a leading light in the disability movement. 'She is trying to get me more involved. One of the things I feel strongly about is direct payments to personal assistants. People should have the money and be able to employ the right people. They are being clobbered over what are essential services, not luxuries. My condition restricts me in terms of personal care. I can't reach my feet to put my shoes on. It is not like having an au pair. I have friends in wheelchairs who are more independent than I am.' And she doesn't like the way that new discoveries are hyped up. 'My nan was always ringing me up and saying \"Louise have you seen this new cure, people are running up and down stairs with it.\" But you know it will be three years before clinical trials even begin.' People should, she says, think very carefully about the words they use and think whether they would talk about race in the same way as disability. Louise admits she's special. Not because she's disabled. Not because she is heroic in the face of a debilitating disease. But because she is Max's daughter.",

      "body": "<b> The Rake's Progress, Carmen</b> Hexagon, Reading <p><b> Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande </b> Coliseum, London WC2 </p> <p>Only the manifold talents of a company such as English Touring Opera could persuade you to spend two evenings, almost voluntarily, in the Hexagon, Reading. Such is the minimal charm of this 1977 edifice that the maligned Barbican appears a Taj Mahal in comparison. The brown hessian hanging off the walls dates its last (or first?) decoration all too accurately.</p> <p>Judging from the small audiences, the people of Reading don't flock to fill its cavernous reaches either, though The Supremes and the Chuckle Brothers (appearing soon) are said to do well. Last week, Chris Smith opened the restored Town Hall, with its refurbished 1864 Father Willis organ, as well as a museum and art gallery. A strong season of concerts is planned for the 780-seat hall, silent as a music venue for a decade. Now it should be the turn of this six-sided concrete barn to get some of that same Heritage lottery money and have a revamp, before opera dies in the city completely. </p> <p>ETO, an unrivalled asset to operatic life, managed gamely none the less. No stranger to tricky venues, it knows the nation's arts centres all too well, from Hexagon to Octagon (Yeovil), Crawley to Crewe. The spring tour follows the company's usual practice of staging a new production and a revival. <b> The Rake's Progress</b>, Stravinsky's 1951 opera after Hogarth's engravings, to a libretto by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, was the season's novelty. Robert Chevara brought customary clarity to this brittle piece of neo-classicism, designed in tangy, fresh colours by Emma Cattell, avoiding any whiff of predictable over-the-top campness. </p> <p>Baba the Turk (the bearded lady), whom Stravinsky's lawyer called a 'distasteful homosexual joke', was indeed a bearded lady rather than a louche cross-dresser, a curiosity rather than a stereotype. She thereby challenged preconceptions all the more rigorously. All the principals gave intelligent performances. The orchestra, conducted by Andrew Greenwood, relished Stravinsky's tart wit, with fine woodwind solos. To perform to this standard with almost no response from the audience, mostly too far from the stage to engage with this teasing work, was a real feat. </p> <p>Attendance at <b> Carmen</b> was healthier, as might be expected. The modern-dress production, again by Chevara with sets by Yannis Thavoris, emphasised the drabness of tobacco-factory life, rather than Spanish heat and light. Emma Selway, sharing the Carmen with Katija Dragojevic, has a sensational voice, but her pale beauty and statuesque physique seemed miscast. A natural for the queens and countesses of the operatic repertoire, she seemed uneasy as a hot, hip-waggling Mediterranean gypsy. Yet musical standards were high and the score sizzled, with Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts catching the slow-witted anger of Don Jos\u00e9 to perfection, and Pamela Wilcock an affecting Mica\u00ebla. This is opera played straight and without fuss. </p> <p>No one could accuse English National Opera's <b> Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande</b> of unnecessary clutter. First seen at Opera North in 1995, its set (by Antony McDonald) consists largely of what might be a large blackboard on which someone has chalked the outline of a wonky three-roomed house. In the orchestral interludes, played in their extended versions, a front cloth descended, depicting this house alone by the sea. Maeterlinck's play (which Debussy reworked) makes much of the oppressive forest. Yet this landscape was peculiarly denuded, as if specially chosen as an example of global deforestation, or set in a place famous for its treelessness - Shetland, or Long Island maybe. </p> <p>But the extent to which the work's obsession with trees, pools, stagnant water should be taken literally has always been a matter for debate. Producers are free to do what they want.

      "bodyText": "The Rake's Progress, Carmen Hexagon, Reading Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande Coliseum, London WC2 Only the manifold talents of a company such as English Touring Opera could persuade you to spend two evenings, almost voluntarily, in the Hexagon, Reading. Such is the minimal charm of this 1977 edifice that the maligned Barbican appears a Taj Mahal in comparison. The brown hessian hanging off the walls dates its last (or first?) decoration all too accurately. Judging from the small audiences, the people of Reading don't flock to fill its cavernous reaches either, though The Supremes and the Chuckle Brothers (appearing soon) are said to do well. Last week, Chris Smith opened the restored Town Hall, with its refurbished 1864 Father Willis organ, as well as a museum and art gallery. A strong season of concerts is planned for the 780-seat hall, silent as a music venue for a decade. Now it should be the turn of this six-sided concrete barn to get some of that same Heritage lottery money and have a revamp, before opera dies in the city completely. ETO, an unrivalled asset to operatic life, managed gamely none the less. No stranger to tricky venues, it knows the nation's arts centres all too well, from Hexagon to Octagon (Yeovil), Crawley to Crewe. The spring tour follows the company's usual practice of staging a new production and a revival. The Rake's Progress, Stravinsky's 1951 opera after Hogarth's engravings, to a libretto by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, was the season's novelty. Robert Chevara brought customary clarity to this brittle piece of neo-classicism, designed in tangy, fresh colours by Emma Cattell, avoiding any whiff of predictable over-the-top campness. Baba the Turk (the bearded lady), whom Stravinsky's lawyer called a 'distasteful homosexual joke', was indeed a bearded lady rather than a louche cross-dresser, a curiosity rather than a stereotype. She thereby challenged preconceptions all the more rigorously. All the principals gave intelligent performances. The orchestra, conducted by Andrew Greenwood, relished Stravinsky's tart wit, with fine woodwind solos. To perform to this standard with almost no response from the audience, mostly too far from the stage to engage with this teasing work, was a real feat. Attendance at Carmen was healthier, as might be expected. The modern-dress production, again by Chevara with sets by Yannis Thavoris, emphasised the drabness of tobacco-factory life, rather than Spanish heat and light. Emma Selway, sharing the Carmen with Katija Dragojevic, has a sensational voice, but her pale beauty and statuesque physique seemed miscast. A natural for the queens and countesses of the operatic repertoire, she seemed uneasy as a hot, hip-waggling Mediterranean gypsy. Yet musical standards were high and the score sizzled, with Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts catching the slow-witted anger of Don Jos\u00e9 to perfection, and Pamela Wilcock an affecting Mica\u00ebla. This is opera played straight and without fuss. No one could accuse English National Opera's Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande of unnecessary clutter. First seen at Opera North in 1995, its set (by Antony McDonald) consists largely of what might be a large blackboard on which someone has chalked the outline of a wonky three-roomed house. In the orchestral interludes, played in their extended versions, a front cloth descended, depicting this house alone by the sea. Maeterlinck's play (which Debussy reworked) makes much of the oppressive forest. Yet this landscape was peculiarly denuded, as if specially chosen as an example of global deforestation, or set in a place famous for its treelessness - Shetland, or Long Island maybe. But the extent to which the work's obsession with trees, pools, stagnant water should be taken literally has always been a matter for debate. Producers are free to do what they want. Symbolism is about symbols after all. By taking this naked approach, Richard Jones forces the dark triangle of M\u00e9lisande, her husband Golaud and her lover Pell\u00e9as into grim focus. Only her long russet-red hair breaks the monochrome. Arkel (Clive Bayley), usually bearded and sage-like, has become a ghostly, hairless creature, twitching like a stoat. Thirteen-year-old David Wigram was enchanting as the pitiful Yniold, overgrown but emotionally stunted. At the end, the three cell-like rooms have become a morgue, M\u00e9lisande in one, Pell\u00e9as laid out in the next. In the last, a brilliant stroke, the gangly Yniold has pulled a sheet over his head, dead in life.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Who is Bridget Fonda? It's an easy question to answer on a dynastic level: granddaughter of Henry, daughter of Peter, niece of Jane. Personally and professionally, however, she's a little harder to pin down. Despite making more than 30 films in the course of a 13-year career, the 'breakthrough' role continues to elude her; for every commercial and critical success, like the stalker-plagued flatmate in Single White Female or the hotpanted, doped-up schemer in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown, there has been a raft of what could most benevolently be described as 'quirky' indie projects, like Rough Magic (where she played a magician's assistant who laid an egg that hatched into a tarantula, before turning into a Mayan goddess - Fonda, that is, not the tarantula) and Drop Dead Fred (basically a doomed Hollywood vehicle for Rik Mayall in which she languished on the sidelines as a 'cold, huge-boobed bimbo'). She's more often mistaken for Helen Hunt or Jodie Foster than recognised for herself. 'I have no regular shtick,' she confesses. 'After all, this time, I still have no real idea of where I'm going.'</p> <p>Her latest role won't help clarify matters. Lake Placid is a curious would-be comic monster movie, featuring a disparate bunch of Hollywood archetypes - Bill Pullman's rugged, no-nonsense ranger, Oliver Platt's eccentric amateur naturalist, Fonda's unworldly but sexy palaeontologist - who come together in an effort to catch a giant crocodile munching its way through Maine. Ally McBeal creator David E Kelley's script aims at postmodern irony, but the movie bombed in the States; still, Fonda gets to utter a series of classic creature-feature lines ('It's coming straight for us!') and try out her best maiden-in-peril scream. However, when I suggest that such enterprises must be like a busman's holiday for actors - nice location, not too taxing, FX-men taking the heat - she's quick to disabuse me.</p> <p>'I thought the effects would do all the work, but it's actually a tough challenge to make something like this hang together. You have to bring energy to it; there's no laziness allowed. It was fun, great fun,' she concludes, sounding a little like she's trying to convince herself of the fact.</p> <p>When you encounter Bridget Fonda in the flesh, you wonder how the Johnny-come-lately likes of Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd have had the temerity to leapfrog over her and on to the Hollywood A-list. At 36, she looks a good 10 years younger, with her lustrous blonde hair (currently long and curled), animated grey-blue eyes, flawless, almost translucent skin, button nose, and doughty Fonda jaw (and yes, there's a passing resemblance to both Hunt and Foster). She fits right into the elegantly chic surroundings of LA's Mondrian hotel in a sheer beige blouse and knee-length navy skirt. She's also a captivating screen presence, elevating the humdrum likes of grunge comedy Singles and last year's A Simple Plan with her quicksilver intelligence. However, it quickly becomes apparent that she doesn't possess the ruthlessness or single-mindedness of, say, Demi Moore; when offered the choice of leads in Single White Female, she plumped for the much quieter, subtler role of the menaced Allie rather than the more grandstanding turn of the menacee Hedy, which established Jennifer Jason Leigh's career.</p> <p>'I'm just not meant to be that kind of person,' she says of Hollywood's name-above-the-title multiplex fillers, 'and that's fine by me. My tastes are too diverse. I don't want to be known as someone who can only do a certain thing, or be a certain way; I want to have the freedom to experiment. Who wants to be narrowed down or put in a box? I'm freer this way; I'll never be cast as the girl who's so pretty she can just stand there, or the one who's so quirky and comical that the whole thing stands or falls on her performance. All I'm looking for,' she says passionately, 'is something that just gets me here.' And she points in the general direction of her gut.</p> <p>As the conversation develops, however, you realise that Fonda's overdue promotion to the Premier League could be as much a question of confidence as destiny. She's referred repeatedly to herself in the past as 'a shy person' and declared that she had 'a lack of belief in myself'. 'You tend to focus on the negative when you're trying to figure out who you are,' she says now. 'You shouldn't define yourself that way, but I'm really self-critical; I have a hard time patting myself on the back. I'm trying to enjoy it more as I go along, because this is actually a great job and I love doing it. I also think it's helping me to be braver, because my first instinct is fear of failure, of the leap in the dark, which I have to override all the time. Part of the glory of acting is that you continually take chances, and sure, I've had bad experiences where I've ended up working with people I don't like, times when I've felt like Sisyphus, rolling the rock to the top of the hill only for it to end up at the bottom again. But when it all comes together,' she beams serenely, 'there's nothing better. I'm sorry,' she says suddenly, 'I'm a little like my father in that I take it all very seriously.'</p> <p>Ah yes, her father. As if making it in the cut throat world of Hollywood wasn't Sisyphean enough, Fonda had to labour under the extra yoke of her illustrious provenance. The second child of Peter and his second wife, Susan Brewer - her elder brother, Justin, is a cinematographer - Bridget was born with a hole in the heart, which, she says, is a lot less dramatic than it sounds (though she has to take antibiotics before cleaning her teeth to prevent the risk of opportunistic infection). While her father was about to become the poster boy for the burgeoning counterculture via 1969's Easy Rider and the ingestion of prodigious amounts of hallucinogenics, Fonda's mother was a traditional homemaker, and her LA childhood reflected both parental strands.</p> <p>'People imagine that I was dumped in the corner of a series of drug-fuelled orgies, and that we were like savages in the bush,' she says, 'but it wasn't like that at all. I grew up around adults who were imaginative and spontaneous, sure, and it was fantastic to go on that ride. I remember going to see my godparents [Larry 'JR' Hagman and his wife Maj], who lived on Malibu beach, and we'd have flag parades and put on hats and march up and down the beach while my godfather played the flute. And my dad would chase me round the tennis court on rollerskates.</p> <p>'But I had discipline. I called everyone Mr and Mrs, like friends' parents and teachers, even though it was a time when everyone was insisting on being called by their first names. I always washed my hands before I ate, and used a napkin. I mean, my dad may have been a hippy biker in the public mind, but he was always a classy, well-turned-out hippy.'</p> <p>Peter and Susan divorced in 1972, and the kids were taken to live with their mother (Peter launched an ultimately unsuccessful custody battle for her brother, ignoring Bridget, though this didn't seem to affect their relationship unduly; she went to stay on his yacht in Hawaii during the school holidays, snorkelling and collecting seashells). She toyed with the idea of becoming a fashion designer or artist until, appearing in a school play, she mistimed a cue and crashed through a partition on to the stage, cutting her knee as she did so. This inauspicious debut fuelled a desire to join the family firm, and she went off to study acting at New York University. She remembers her first day in class, when the lecturer invited each student to stand up and articulate their reasons for being there; when he got to Fonda, he said, dismissively: 'Of course, we know why you're here.'</p> <p>Was she hurt by such slights, I ask. 'Not really,' she says tentatively, 'because I grew up with people knowing who I was and where I came from. I was noticed because of my antecedents, which was strange.'</p> <p>And how had that affected her sense of identity? 'I can't answer that, because I have no idea what it would have been like otherwise. It's like saying, \"What would it have been like if you weren't a woman?\" Gee, I could guess, but that's all it would be.' (Though it's obviously a question that preys on her mind, because she later says: 'I often wonder what it would be like to come into this completely fresh - when I see people from a non-entertainment-industry family who've made it, I'm like, \"Wow, you're here because of your own efforts - the way you're perceived isn't based on someone else's achievements.\" I can't allow myself that, because I always factor in nepotism. Still,' she shrugs, 'if no one wanted to watch me, I guess they'd have stopped hiring me a long time ago.')</p> <p>When she told Peter she was going to be an actress, he said she'd have to climb Everest four times: for her grandfather, her father, her aunt, and for herself. It's a quote he's often repeated since. When I bring it up, Fonda groans theatrically. 'Oh, he loves that old Everest quote. True, everyone expected me to be good, automatically, and I had to learn to fall on my face. But actually,' she confides, 'the Everest thing was probably more of a problem for him than for me. You know, he was the son of the quintessential American icon. Grandpa Henry played Tom Joad, Abe Lincoln, Wyatt Earp, for heaven's sake. It would be hard for anyone to follow in those footsteps.' (She's previously said that 'Grandpa Henry' was the one in the family she most related to: 'He was very quiet and shy. He painted. He kept bees\u0085')</p> <p>So she didn't take professional advice from her father or aunt? She looks incredulous at the suggestion. 'Everyone forgets - this is my family we're talking about. How would you feel if your mum or dad were giving you their opinion all the time? Say you're leaving the house, and one of them doesn't like what you're wearing - well, your natural inclination would be to wear something even worse, wouldn't it? You know, the nice thing,' she says, attempting to rein herself back in, 'is that I respect them. I never felt that I had to deny their existence or be embarrassed by association.'</p> <p>It hasn't always been plain sailing with Auntie Jane, though - didn't Bridget once say that she 'couldn't give a damn' about her exercise videos, and that she couldn't think of anything more boring than 'jumping around with a lot of smelly, sweaty people'; that, furthermore, most of her movies were 'pretty lightweight', and she wasn't fired by politics in the same way because 'all politics are boring'?</p> <p>Fonda rolls her eyes heavenward. 'At one time, there was nothing the press would have liked better than to set up a me vs Jane thing,' she says wearily. 'They were desperate for us to be bitter rivals. They'd also try to set me against my dad, to use me as a dart to throw at someone else. And no, I don't like aerobics - I hate any kind of regimented workout - but that's just me, it's got nothing to do with anybody else.</p> <p>'People forget that Jane's not my mom - she's my dad's sister - and although we're close, I don't see her that often. She lives in Montana; I live in Los Angeles. I think people expect us to be constantly having these On Golden Pond hug-ins, and we don't. We're just not that kind of family - though I sometimes think it would be great if we were,' she says poignantly. (Consequently, she's unable to elaborate on the ramifications of Jane's divorce or her rumoured conversion to born-again Christianity.)</p> <p>Such bruising encounters have led Fonda to be a lot more circumspect about her private life; she still shudders at the memory of early interviews, when she informed passing hacks of her impending marriage to English writer/director Lee Drysdale, flashed her engagement ring, and revealed that she wanted 'at least two children'. The relationship disintegrated after a few years. 'I was incredibly naive,' she says now. 'I thought it was impolite not to give people what they so obviously wanted. It took me a long time to realise it's my right not to answer questions.'</p> <p>But her withdrawal was also a reaction to so much of her life being in the public domain, thanks to innumerable family interviews and her father's autobiography, Don't Tell Dad - a book she claims she's never read. 'My father's incredibly open, but I want to keep my memories my own,' she says earnestly. 'I don't want to read someone else's version of them in case they conflict with mine.' Her subsequent six-year relationship with Eric Stoltz was thus spared the harsh light of over-exposure (unless you count the explicit sex scene the pair essayed in the Stoltz-directed movie Bodies, Rest and Motion ). She's now seeing country singer Dwight Yoakam ('Yes, you can say that, it's a matter of public record'), and recently completed filming the lead role in this directorial debut South of Heaven, West of Hell.</p> <p>'It's hard to define, which is what I'm attracted to,' she says of the part. 'I wrote pages of thoughts on where this person's coming from, none of which you'll see in the film. But she's a woman who returns to a horrible place she got away from, after attempting suicide and sinking really low, to save her cousin from what she fears will be the same fate. It's kind of abstract, but it really affected me.'</p> <p>Her other upcoming movie, Monkeybone, is a delirious-sounding live-action/animation fable from the people who brought you The Nightmare Before Christmas, starring Brendan Fraser as a man possessed by the soul of an evil primate.</p> <p>But while she may run and run, Fonda can't hide. Families are still uppermost in her mind, both venerable and putative. She's now 'closer than I've maybe ever been' to her father, who's been welcomed back into the Hollywood fold, after years in the wilderness, with his Oscar nomination for Ulee's Gold and the deadpan cool of The Limey. (I interviewed him on the release of the latter, and the pride that radiated out of him on mention of his daughter's name was so palpable, you could have warmed your hands on it; he also revealed, somewhat alarmingly, that he and Fonda 'bark like dogs' when greeting each other on the telephone.)</p> <p>'I'm so happy for him,' she says. 'He's been working with great people, and he's having the time of his life. He's a real trouper, and he's so appreciative of the fact that he's still given the chance to do it. He's a cynicism-free zone, and I hope I'll be like that when I'm his age.'</p> <p>She's also ready to start her own family, though, once bitten, she's careful not to lay down child quotas with designated partners. 'Yes, I'd love that,' Fonda says, 'but not at any cost. I mean, I want a family, I don't just want to be a mother.' You get the feeling that, once she's produced her brood, acting would be a secondary concern, though she says, 'I just don't know how I'd react once it was a reality; I'd have to see how the hormones settled. It would be great to experience life through their eyes, teach them all kinds of stuff, be with them all the time, but I also have so much fun doing what I do, I couldn't imagine living without it.'</p> <p>This, then, may be the answer to the question of Bridget Fonda's identity: someone who's carved out an autonomous niche for herself against daunting precedent, in the light of which her quiet-but-stoic anonymity, and her determination to experiment rather than aim all out for the top like a heat-seeking missile, look less like underachievement and more like a survival technique.</p> <p>'I can't help who I am,' she says.

      "bodyText": "Who is Bridget Fonda? It's an easy question to answer on a dynastic level: granddaughter of Henry, daughter of Peter, niece of Jane. Personally and professionally, however, she's a little harder to pin down. Despite making more than 30 films in the course of a 13-year career, the 'breakthrough' role continues to elude her; for every commercial and critical success, like the stalker-plagued flatmate in Single White Female or the hotpanted, doped-up schemer in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown, there has been a raft of what could most benevolently be described as 'quirky' indie projects, like Rough Magic (where she played a magician's assistant who laid an egg that hatched into a tarantula, before turning into a Mayan goddess - Fonda, that is, not the tarantula) and Drop Dead Fred (basically a doomed Hollywood vehicle for Rik Mayall in which she languished on the sidelines as a 'cold, huge-boobed bimbo'). She's more often mistaken for Helen Hunt or Jodie Foster than recognised for herself. 'I have no regular shtick,' she confesses. 'After all, this time, I still have no real idea of where I'm going.' Her latest role won't help clarify matters. Lake Placid is a curious would-be comic monster movie, featuring a disparate bunch of Hollywood archetypes - Bill Pullman's rugged, no-nonsense ranger, Oliver Platt's eccentric amateur naturalist, Fonda's unworldly but sexy palaeontologist - who come together in an effort to catch a giant crocodile munching its way through Maine. Ally McBeal creator David E Kelley's script aims at postmodern irony, but the movie bombed in the States; still, Fonda gets to utter a series of classic creature-feature lines ('It's coming straight for us!') and try out her best maiden-in-peril scream. However, when I suggest that such enterprises must be like a busman's holiday for actors - nice location, not too taxing, FX-men taking the heat - she's quick to disabuse me. 'I thought the effects would do all the work, but it's actually a tough challenge to make something like this hang together. You have to bring energy to it; there's no laziness allowed. It was fun, great fun,' she concludes, sounding a little like she's trying to convince herself of the fact. When you encounter Bridget Fonda in the flesh, you wonder how the Johnny-come-lately likes of Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd have had the temerity to leapfrog over her and on to the Hollywood A-list. At 36, she looks a good 10 years younger, with her lustrous blonde hair (currently long and curled), animated grey-blue eyes, flawless, almost translucent skin, button nose, and doughty Fonda jaw (and yes, there's a passing resemblance to both Hunt and Foster). She fits right into the elegantly chic surroundings of LA's Mondrian hotel in a sheer beige blouse and knee-length navy skirt. She's also a captivating screen presence, elevating the humdrum likes of grunge comedy Singles and last year's A Simple Plan with her quicksilver intelligence. However, it quickly becomes apparent that she doesn't possess the ruthlessness or single-mindedness of, say, Demi Moore; when offered the choice of leads in Single White Female, she plumped for the much quieter, subtler role of the menaced Allie rather than the more grandstanding turn of the menacee Hedy, which established Jennifer Jason Leigh's career. 'I'm just not meant to be that kind of person,' she says of Hollywood's name-above-the-title multiplex fillers, 'and that's fine by me. My tastes are too diverse. I don't want to be known as someone who can only do a certain thing, or be a certain way; I want to have the freedom to experiment. Who wants to be narrowed down or put in a box? I'm freer this way; I'll never be cast as the girl who's so pretty she can just stand there, or the one who's so quirky and comical that the whole thing stands or falls on her performance. All I'm looking for,' she says passionately, 'is something that just gets me here.' And she points in the general direction of her gut. As the conversation develops, however, you realise that Fonda's overdue promotion to the Premier League could be as much a question of confidence as destiny. She's referred repeatedly to herself in the past as 'a shy person' and declared that she had 'a lack of belief in myself'. 'You tend to focus on the negative when you're trying to figure out who you are,' she says now. 'You shouldn't define yourself that way, but I'm really self-critical; I have a hard time patting myself on the back. I'm trying to enjoy it more as I go along, because this is actually a great job and I love doing it. I also think it's helping me to be braver, because my first instinct is fear of failure, of the leap in the dark, which I have to override all the time. Part of the glory of acting is that you continually take chances, and sure, I've had bad experiences where I've ended up working with people I don't like, times when I've felt like Sisyphus, rolling the rock to the top of the hill only for it to end up at the bottom again. But when it all comes together,' she beams serenely, 'there's nothing better. I'm sorry,' she says suddenly, 'I'm a little like my father in that I take it all very seriously.' Ah yes, her father.

At one time, the code was understated - now, designers are racing to dress the stars, and we have Armani to thank for it. He hired a publicist to make the connections in 1988. <p><b> Who are the hottest designers? </b> Aside from surefire winners like Armani, Versace, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, designers such as Badgley Mischka, Valentino, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Richard Tyler and Vera Wang instinctively know what is needed for that red-carpet moment. Their dresses make front-page headlines. Even the guys get a look in - this year Brit tailor Timothy Everest is dressing Tom Cruise. </p> <p><b> Who wields the power?</b> The many stylists, costume designers and personal dressers who've become minor celebrities in their own right. The bigger the star, the more money they have, the better taste they are able to buy (read demand - stars now expect to keep the loaned dress). Costume designer Barbara Tfank has the most clout. She spun Uma Thurman into Prada couture in 1995, while in 1998 stylist Arianne Philips scored badly with Madonna's Jean-Paul Gaultier/Olivier Theyskins goth combo. </p> <p><b> What do designers get out of it? </b> Millions of dollars of free publicity, especially if the star is a winner. The day before the event, designers release their dress list to the press and celebs are expected to name names when they hit the red carpet. </p> <p><b> This year's tips? </b> At the couture shows in January and the ready-to-wear collections in February, fashion editors take careful note of the evening dresses and the front-row celebrities. This year, presenter Salma Hayek may wear Armani and Ashley Judd, Valentino and it's a good bet that nominee Hilary Swank will also be in Valentino. All eyes will be on Gwyneth Paltrow, Catherine Zeta Jones, Cameron Diaz and Julianne Moore. Tomorrow morning, log on to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">latimes.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.oscars.com\" target_new>oscars.com</a> and you will get the full dress list. If you are early, you might get your order in before anyone else. </p> <p><b> What's a designer's worst nightmare? </b> The actress who changes her mind at the 11th hour. It famously happened to Vera Wang in 1996 when, at the last minute, Sharon Stone dumped the dress that had been designed especially for her and slipped on a black Gap T-shirt, Valentino silk skirt and Armani coat which she put together herself - a star's prerogative.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why have the Oscars become such a fashion fest? With four hours' air time and 1 billion viewers, the focus is as much on the frocks as the awards. At one time, the code was understated - now, designers are racing to dress the stars, and we have Armani to thank for it. He hired a publicist to make the connections in 1988. Who are the hottest designers? Aside from surefire winners like Armani, Versace, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, designers such as Badgley Mischka, Valentino, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Richard Tyler and Vera Wang instinctively know what is needed for that red-carpet moment. Their dresses make front-page headlines. Even the guys get a look in - this year Brit tailor Timothy Everest is dressing Tom Cruise. Who wields the power? The many stylists, costume designers and personal dressers who've become minor celebrities in their own right. The bigger the star, the more money they have, the better taste they are able to buy (read demand - stars now expect to keep the loaned dress). Costume designer Barbara Tfank has the most clout. She spun Uma Thurman into Prada couture in 1995, while in 1998 stylist Arianne Philips scored badly with Madonna's Jean-Paul Gaultier/Olivier Theyskins goth combo. What do designers get out of it? Millions of dollars of free publicity, especially if the star is a winner. The day before the event, designers release their dress list to the press and celebs are expected to name names when they hit the red carpet. This year's tips? At the couture shows in January and the ready-to-wear collections in February, fashion editors take careful note of the evening dresses and the front-row celebrities. This year, presenter Salma Hayek may wear Armani and Ashley Judd, Valentino and it's a good bet that nominee Hilary Swank will also be in Valentino. All eyes will be on Gwyneth Paltrow, Catherine Zeta Jones, Cameron Diaz and Julianne Moore. Tomorrow morning, log on to latimes.com or oscars.com and you will get the full dress list. If you are early, you might get your order in before anyone else. What's a designer's worst nightmare? The actress who changes her mind at the 11th hour. It famously happened to Vera Wang in 1996 when, at the last minute, Sharon Stone dumped the dress that had been designed especially for her and slipped on a black Gap T-shirt, Valentino silk skirt and Armani coat which she put together herself - a star's prerogative.",

      "body": "<p>Recently, I have been discussing the latest thoughts regarding hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) with endocrinologists (hormone specialists), patients and friends. Ask the specialists about the incidence of hypoglycaemia and many of them will dismiss it as a fallacy - it only exists when people are taking medication such as insulin or tablets to control their diabetes or, in rarer circumstances, when someone has undergone gastric surgery or has a serious, detectable abnormality such as a tumour within the pancreas - the organ that helps the body control blood sugars.</p> <p>But when I talk to patients, friends - even my sister - all of whom have problems controlling their symptoms, the majority will utter dismay at the thought that hypoglycaemia is a modern stress-related phenomenon and that, according to Professor Williams of University Hospital, Liverpool, it 'has nothing to do with low blood-sugar levels'. He believes that identical symptoms can be induced by stress, and particularly by overbreathing or hyperventilation. He also said at a recent media event, that 'it is simply a myth that certain sugar-rich foods cause blood sugar levels to rise dramatically and then crash shortly afterwards. This does not happen in non-diabetic subjects, because various hormones keep blood sugar levels within a very narrow range.'</p> <p>But, that said, as a practitioner I am reluctant to turn around to patients who present classic hypoglycaemia symptoms and tell them that diet has nothing to do with it and they should just start breathing properly. Typically, hypoglycaemic patients can feel weak, shaky, extremely moody, nauseous, acutely tired, have problems sleeping and suffer headaches - they can even break out in a cold sweat. Children can be hard to appease, and adults can feel violent when they haven't eaten for a while. Even if some doctors and the Sugar Bureau profess that these symptoms have nothing to do with blood-sugar levels (in the majority of cases), I think it is extremely worthwhile to look at the way you're eating to see whether symptoms can disappear. For the majority of sufferers, nutritional changes can have profoundly positive effects - as soon as you eat in a way that enables your blood-sugar levels to remain as constant as possible (in your own terms), symptoms can disappear.</p> <p>One of the reasons why many specialists believe hypoglycaemia to be a disorder diagnosed (frequently by oneself) incorrectly, is that the diagnosis is in itself difficult - blood tests frequently fail to reflect what and how you're feeling. Even then, everyone is different. In some people, symptoms can even appear when they haven't eaten for a while but their blood-sugar level is above the point at which it is technically considered to be low. Others experience symptoms which make them feel unwell after they have eaten a very sweet food - they just appear to be overly sensitive, for whatever reason. In a way we don't need to know the reason (as long as you have seen your doctor to exclude the issue of tumours or diabetes, etc). What matters is how to help yourself - which is where food comes in.</p> <p>Usually, when you eat carbohydrate (sugar-containing food), in either a simple form, such as chocolate, or complex form, as in a piece of bread, the body secretes the hormone insulin, enabling it to use the sugar as fuel or store it as fat for later use. If too little insulin is secreted, the blood-sugar level remains too high, and you become diabetic. Hypoglycaemia is the opposite condition and is thought, in many cases, to be due to too much insulin being produced, which causes blood-sugar levels to plummet beyond a point you are comfortable with. The first and foremost guideline is to eat a well-balanced diet: plenty of fresh vegetables, fruits, wholegrain cereals, lean proteins, dairy foods, small amounts of fat and plenty of water. Eating regularly helps you 'stabilise' your sugar levels, so try not to leave more than three or four hours between meals or snacks. I cite the example of a friend who finds that unless she eats a substantial breakfast as soon as she wakes up, she feels dizzy, sick and can (according to many level-headed observers), appear to be in a daze. As soon as she eats, she becomes a functioning human being.</p> <p>Eating regularly throughout the day should prevent your blood sugar from dropping below the point at which you're comfortable and helps you refrain from overeating at meal times, which could cause you to become overloaded with sugar-containing foods (which can trigger similar symptoms to those caused by low blood-sugar levels in some people). The majority of people I see feel a lot better if they have five or six snacks a day rather than two or three large meals. If you're worried about excess calories, split meals up - save your dessert for later.</p> <p>It is best to avoid eating sugary foods on an empty stomach, as the rise in blood-sugar level may stimulate your body to secrete a larger amount of insulin than desirable: your sugar level falls quickly, followed by dizziness or other symptoms. Patients frequently find that all types of sugar food - sucrose, glucose, fructose, brown sugar, molasses, honey - have similar effects. I recommend fruit as a healthy snack, as the fruit's fibre cushions the effect of the natural sugar (fructose) and thereby the changes in blood-sugar level. Products labelled 'no added sugar' are by no means sugar-free; usually they are high in natural sugar of one kind or another. Although artificial sweeteners do not directly aggravate sugar levels, I don't recommend them as they don't taste good and can aggravate digestive complaints. It's far better to wean yourself off the desire for excessively sweet things if you find that they cause symptoms. Eating sweet foods after a meal containing a lot of fibre (vegetables and wholegrains such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta or pulses), or choosing a sweet dessert based around fibre - apple crumble with a wholemeal topping - are both measures which appear to be acceptable in a lot of 'sugar-sensitive' people.</p> <p>Boosting chromium can sometimes help you feel less sensitive to sugar levels, so lean towards chromium-rich foods - cheese, shellfish (molluscs, such as scallops, clams, oysters), baked beans and wholemeal products. Better to do this rather than reach for the chromium supplement, as it is still uncertain exactly how much chromium we need and therefore there is the potential to overdose. (The majority of people absorb sufficient quantities if they include in their diet a good-sized portion of chromium-rich food daily, or every other day.)</p> <p>Since caffeine causes your pancreas to secrete more insulin, overloading with tea, coffee or cola can aggravate symptoms - so the cup of coffee to perk you up can be disastrous. Instead, drink plenty of water, herb teas and the occasional freshly squeezed fruit juice. Avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach, as this causes blood-sugar levels to drop. Wait until your stomach contains some fibre (a banana or a slice of wholemeal toast), before you go out drinking. If you find yourself feeling horribly 'low' here's the survival plan: have a sweet, high-fibre snack to help bring your sugar level up to normal.</p> <p>Sweets and chocolates may cause your body to produce more insulin than you're happy with, which causes even more problems - so watch these quick fixes. Fruit combines sugar and fibre, so a fruit-based snack is ideal. Try to eat a well-balanced meal as soon as possible afterwards. Avoid caffeine. Above all, rest - vigorous exercise will make symptoms worse. Relax, concentrate on breathing calmly, keep warm and have a hot drink, such as a mug of hot milk or camomile tea - all of which should soon bring the 'swing' to a stop.</p>",

She carried on stirring and dictated the recipe as if from page one of the Khmer Rouge Cookbook : 'First, kill the cobra. Then cut off its head and hang it on a tree for the poison to dry in the sun, away from the children. Collect the snake blood in a cup and serve it with white wine.

Pol Pot, the genocidal Stalinist who oversaw Year Zero in Cambodia in 1975, and the consequent death of millions under his brutal Khmer Rouge regime, has been dead for three years. But the dark shadow of his rule lives on across Cambodia, and nowhere more so than in Pailin.</p> <p>The town enjoys the following write-up in the 1996 Lonely Planet Travel Guide to Cambodia: 'Pailin (elevation 257 metres), 83km south-west of Battambang near the Thai border, is another place that foreigners won't be visiting for the foreseeable future. It is the Khmer Rouge gem-mining area, and, unless you look like a rich Thai gem trader, you have a very good chance of being shot if you turn up unannounced.'</p> <p>These travel guides, they always get it wrong. I wasn't shot in Pailin, but the town is not exactly Sa Coma, Majorca. Its tourist potential is undeveloped. To say the town is beyond the writ of the Cambodian government is an understatement. You fly to Battambang, then you take a dirt road. The potholes are not big, they're lunar. You drive through potholes where naked children play in the dust and water buffalo wallow in potholes in the potholes. In the roadside villages, women cast seeds over fields with a timeless grace, while men yawn, comatose, in hammocks. The villages thin out. The road twists through a moonscape of naked grey hillsides, the ashes of the burnt-down rainforest. You drive past miles and miles of charred earth and stumps, the legacy of a lost forest canopy. In 1960, 90 per cent of Cambodia was forest; now it's less than 30 per cent - an ecological crime fuelled by greed and war. Every once in a while, a stretch of the countryside is staked out by a vivid red sign, on it a scribble in Khmer, indecipherable, and a skull with deep white eye sockets, crossed bones and the words in English: 'Danger! Mines!!' A walk on the wild side in this part of Cambodia will most probably end with you hobbling on a stump. Cambodia is mined to tears.</p> <p>The 'border' was marked by nothing so sophisticated as a crossing or a frontier. Just a skull and some leg bones, sitting in their own look-out position, on a pole, shaded from the heat of the day by a sheet of corrugated iron to make a little roof. The skull marks the last outpost of Royal Cambodian government authority. From here on in, the countryside gets emptier and emptier, creepier and creepier, as we drove deeper into Cambodia's Wild West. It's always a bad sign when there are no cars on the road coming the other way, no cows in the fields, no kids playing in the near distance. Just an empty road, the ashes of forests thousands of years old, and a primeval silence.</p> <p>Pailin turned out to be bursting with its own queasy charm. It is a rat's nest of holes in the ground, dirt-floored casinos and whorehouses, set in a bowl of purple, corrugated hills. The heat suffocates, the sky a weird brown from the dust thrown up by the gem miners, who make the holes in the ground. There are two types of miners: the rich ones and the poor, both prospecting for rubies and sapphires. The poor miners buy plots of land for $50, and dig deep wells which can collapse at any moment. The rich use state-of-the-art digging machines which throb and roar through the night, raping the earth. During the day, the gem miners trade their wares with the dealers, a street of well-fed entrepreneurs who stare at rubies, emeralds, amber and passing humanity, assessing their worth down to the last dollar with the coldest of eyes.</p> <p>And the miners themselves? The town is peopled by Khmer Rouge killers. Warriors with the thousand-mile stare. Most, but not all, of them have switched uniforms. I saw one ex-KR fighter drive by on his motorbike, balancing his stump from an exploded mine beautifully over the potholes, his telltale lime-green KR Mao cap firmly on his head. Soldiers, officers, generals, PR men and Pol Pot's cronies, and his cook, live, unmolested, in Pailin thanks to a fabulously dirty deal with the government, sealed on Christmas Day 1998, which has left two of Pol Pot's mass-murdering henchmen at liberty.</p> <p>Pailin boasts people, who still, today, think that Pol Pot and co were the good guys. Pol Pot is dead. His butcher-in-chief, Ta Mok, is in custody. But the old KR mind-fuck lives on.</p> <p>The cook, Van Ra, a clever and pleasant woman, waxed lyrical about the old days: 'Pol Pot was a gentle man, who always advised people not to be extravagant. Ta Mok [Pol Pot's butcher] was a patriot. He fought for his country. I feel sad. I spent most of my life struggling for the country, and we lost the war. Pol Pot's time was better than now.'</p> <p>For the record, Pol Pot, his lieutenants Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea and their lime-green-fatigued killers were responsible, with a little help from Henry Kissinger, for the deaths of around 1.5 million people. Matching population for population, a comparable figure for Britain would be around 14 million dead people. For the record, Ta Mok was a one-legged cannibal, who reputedly enjoyed spicing his Chinese wine with human bile.</p> <p>The mincemeating of Cambodia started in the early 70s, when Nixon and Kissinger authorised the bombing of Cambodia, secretly. The KR came in through the chaos started by the American bombing. On 17 April 1975, Pol Pot took power in Phnom Penh, played God with time, and wound the clock back to Year Zero. Under him, the KR butchered people wholesale. Those they didn't kill starved thanks to the KR's murderous primitivism. Hundreds of thousands died because rice crops were not sewn. Intellectuals, doctors, teachers, anyone 'corrupted' by the modern world, was shot. City dwellers were dubbed 'new people'; they were discriminated against by the 'base people'. The KR killed close to 100 per cent of Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese population, a huge percentage of the Cham people, ethnic Muslims, a fifth of the Khmers and a tiny handful of Westerners, pitiful wretches who were photographed shortly before they were killed. A fraction of the killing took place at an old lyc\u00e9e in Phnom Penh called Tuol Sleng. There, 20,000 people were processed. Only six survived.</p> <p>Across Cambodia families were torn apart, children encouraged to spy and disown their parents, and city dwellers forced out of their homes to a countryside in the name of a mindless Communism that would have had Karl Marx howling with despair, then shot. The KR was a moronocracy. Survivors recall being lectured by illiterate 14-year-old KR troopers, armed with all powers, about 'Max-Leninism'. Anyone who laughed at them was a dead man. The catchphrase mockingly addressed by the KR cadres to their victims was: 'Keeping you is no gain. Losing you is no loss.'</p> <p>And in the middle of the raw misery of the Zero Years, Pol Pot himself, however, lived well. The photographs of him in his years of power, from 1975 to 1979, show a man with the tapioca-pudding-smooth skin and soft plumpness of a fleshy buddha. Even after the Vietnamese invaded Democratic Kampuchea on Christmas Day 1978, and drove out Pol Pot from Phnom Penh, and pushed him into the jungle where he lived to kill plenty more in a dirty civil war, the Dear Leader ate handsomely.</p> <p>The cook of Pailin recalled the eating habits of Pol Pot and his friends: 'I used to cook for them. They ate simple country food. But for hygiene's sake, we used to wash the vegetables in potassium permanganate.' This was an item few of Pol Pot's countrymen could afford when a dead rat was a luxury. What did they eat?</p> <p>The cook chewed that one over: 'Deer, wild pig, snake. For dessert, apples, grapes.' They drank brandy, Thai potcheen, and Chinese wine in big, brown pitchers. Cooking for the KR leadership required diplomatic skills. Ta Mok hated stinky fish sauce. Nuon Chea (another KR boss, still at liberty) 'wouldn't eat soup without stinky fish sauce.' She stirred her pot some more.</p> <p>Did he like company, having people, children, around him?</p> <p>'No, he liked quiet, so he didn't like children.' She fussed over pots while, outside the caf\u00e9, a crew of miners piled up on the back of a lorry, their faces covered in red scarves to prevent them being choked by the dust.</p> <p>How did she protect herself in the jungle? She turned to the subject of guns. Pol Pot himself carried a small gun in his holster. The smaller the gun, the higher the rank. She went on: 'I can fire a B-40.' That's a Chinese-made, shoulder-mounted, rocket- propelled grenade with the kick of a mule. Really? 'Yes. I can fire a B-40.' What did she think about the changes to Pailin? 'I'd like to have the B-40, and start with the casino over there. These people are bad. They bring thievery into our area.' They were only gambling, not mass murdering.</p> <p>The Blue Dragon is the best joint in town. It's where it jumps in Pailin. You can feast on Frog Deep Fried Pepper, Spicy Fish Cat, Spicy Frog Mango and Beef Grille Oil, and wash it down with the very best Scottish whisky malts (made in Thailand) and Tiger beer, in the company of Pol Pot's old propaganda apparatchik, Kong Deung, while listening to - what else? - The Spice Girls' 'Wannabe'.</p> <p>Kong used to broadcast the crudest, most bilious hate on Radio LNADK (National Army Radio of Democratic Kampuchea) and is an important accessory to the extinction of 1.5 million people. He articulated the frenzy that led to the mass murder. For example, the Vietnamese were never called the Vietnamese but the 'contemptible savages'. Brutality, torture, murder are easy once the killing is legitimised.</p> <p>At the head table at the Blue Dragon, Kong seems very much at ease with himself, a fit man, in his fifties, comfortable in a pair of black pyjamas. His ring finger is weighed down by a life buoy encrusted with rubies. He takes a swig of beer, grins warmly at a girl with a slit skirt and nods along to the beat. Kong takes to the stage, microphone in hand. He opens his mouth and the metamorphosis is complete. Goodbye KR, hello Charles Aznavour. The KR crooner makes loooooove to his microphone cable, and warbles on. After the first solo number, he is accompanied by a gang of slit-skirted whores - sorry, dancers - strutting their stuff. He has switched from a Khmer version of the French chanteur to, put your hands together please, Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes.</p> <p>Earlier, Kong showed us around his radio station, sited on the top of the denuded purple hills, just up the road from the gutted ruins of a burnt-out tank. Kong's still the propaganda chief of the Pailin District, only these days he broadcasts 'reconciliation', not murder. 'I worked from 1980 till 1994.' (The significance of the 1980 start date is simple. That was when Pol Pol was pushed out of Phnom Penh. Odd that he only got the job in 1980, though, specially since he joined the KR in 1974. Very odd.) 'There were six staff. We received the international news, and wrote a short report. Pol Pot was difficult to work with, to follow his ideology' - though, to be fair to Kong, he managed that feat for 14 years, by his own admittance.</p> <p>Everyone suffered during Pol Pot's terror. Kong himself lost six members of his family, his father, two brothers and three sisters. Two died of starvation; the rest during forced labour. And yet he survived, and lived to croon.</p> <p>Also at the high table at the Blue Dragon was Pol Pot's interpreter for eight years, Mea Makk, an elliptical and enigmatic creep who picked his teeth whenever he was asked a difficult question about the bad old days. At first, he'd fought shy of a chat with The Observer.</p> <p>'Can we have lunch?'</p> <p>'No, I am too busy putting up propaganda for International Women's Day\u0085'</p> <p>But later he joined our table at the Blue Dragon. Ask him about what he did when Pol Pot was in power, and you are treated to some industrial-strength lying. 'I was just a clerk\u0085 we had no freedom to express ourselves\u0085 we just wanted to find the formula to unite.'</p> <p>Mea Makk was there when Pol Pot met His Excellency the President of the People's Republic of China. To say that he was suffering from selective amnesia would be something of an understatement.</p> <p>The crooner who murdered with his mouth and the creep who interpreted for Brother Number One ate and drank their way through the Blue Dragon's menu, $65 for food and $105 for drink. One has to remember that the KR, at the height of its power, was thumpingly puritan. Even as late as March 1997, visitors to Pailin were greeted with the following admonishment: 'Welcome, new people - the following things are not allowed in this zone: thievery, prostitution and gambling.'</p> <p>At the end of Kong's crooning session, one of the dancers, sporting enough lipstick to paint the Forth Bridge, anointed him with a garland of paper chains. The crowd of ex-KR killers, gem miners, illegal loggers, whores and drunks were ecstatic. And the murdered 1.5 million? Dead men don't clap.</p> <p>So how come the crooner and the interpreter live in liberty and comparative luxury, given what they did, who they worked for? They are small fry. Bigger fish are at liberty, too.</p> <p>To understand why, one must realise that Cambodia is one of the most damaged societies on earth. The physical damage is easy to recognise - the burnt forests, the mined countryside, the lunar roads, the broken bodies. Ta Mok, now in jail awaiting his show trial, has only one leg. Hun Sen, a dodgy crook with a hint of viciousness, who happens to be Cambodia's prime minister, has only one eye. Prum Sou, a former KR junior commander, has only one arm. Duol Sareoun, another commander, has one eye.</p> <p>The psychological damage is much harder to recognise but more profound. People live in the present tense. A whole generation of people from their late twenties upwards have no proper sense of society, or the future. They have lived through a time when you had to survive from minute to minute. The English manager of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Phnom Penh - easily the best bar in the world - told me that he had to sack a Cambodian just the day before, a man, an excellent worker, who had been with him for four years. He had been stealing, big time, and thrown away the chances of a good income for years to come. A wire-agency chief told an almost identical story: 'This country looks so beautiful, so lovely. The people have real grace. But get to know them a little, spend time here a little, and you begin to realise that every adult has been through appalling traumas. A whole generation is crazy. They're all fucked.'</p> <p>Justice would help, but justice for the KR killers has been denied all the way long the line, for pernicious and unnecessary reasons.</p> <p>The KR mind-fuck was intensified one appalling day in 1997 when news broke that Pol Pot had died of a heart attack, cheating his people of the trial he so richly deserved. Nevertheless, Pol Pot suffered a pretty miserable end. The people who did for Pol Pot were not the forces of law and order, still less the diplomats of the international community. They were the tree detectives of Global Witness and freelance journalist called Nate Thayer, whose state of mind has never quite been the same since a car he was travelling in went over an anti-tank mine.</p> <p>Global Witness closed down the illegal logging trade between western Cambodia, the area around Pailin controlled by the KR, and Thailand, thanks to its detailed and accurate reporting. The KR slowly began to run out of money to fund its grisly guerrilla campaign against the Phnom Penh government. In 1997, Ta Mok arrested Pol Pol and revealed the prisoner to Nate Thayer. The journalist ran the story on Voice of America, a station which the ex-Brother Number One used to listen to. He died of a heart attack that night. Thayer, over a drink in a bar in Thailand, said: 'I killed Pot Pot, you know.' You don't argue with anyone who has survived an anti-tank mine.</p> <p>From 1996 onwards, senior KR commanders had started to defect. The first to go was Ieng Sary, or Brother 81 - the numbers are a poor guide to proximity to power - who decamped from the Khmer Rouge, taking his troops with him. The soldiers voted with their feet. The last to successfully switch sides was Brother Number Two, ideologist Nuon Chea, and Pol Pot's foreign minister, Khieu Samphan. They came over at Christmas 1998. That left Ta Mok, who was the last to jump and is to be punished by a trial, of sorts.</p> <p>The insult to humanity is a simple one: if 1.5 million people were killed by the Khmer Rouge, how come three surviving KR leaders - Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea - are still at liberty? In Nazi terms, it is as if Goering, Goebbels and Himmler were wandering around Bavaria at liberty, while only Franz Stangl was charged for war crimes.</p> <p>The evidence against Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea is compelling. The Documentation Centre of Cambodia has compiled a stack of smoking-gun documents from the paperwork the KR left behind, showing that the top three knew all about torture and murder.</p> <p>For Brother Nuon? File 734, 'confession of Sieng Pauy alias Sean', two notes sent to Brother Nuon, document dated 9 November 1977: 'Concerning the four questions above, although I pressed him to answer, he did not answer, but he did once tortured.'</p> <p>For Ieng Sary? File N0001158, 'telegram 21, report by comrade Chhon to Brother Pol [Pot], on the arrest and killing of the Vietnamese who spied and hid themselves in the forest, and on the arrest and torture of those who opposed Angkar's [another name for the KR leadership] dam-building plan.' This report was copied to Ieng Sary.</p> <p>For Khieu Samphan? File upon file, some of the paperwork originating from Comrade Duch, the master of the torture centre at Tuol Sleng. One of the exhibits at Tuol Sleng is a 3D map of Cambodia, vaguely reminiscent of the maps made of shells at seaside resorts. Only this map is made of skulls.</p> <p>So why no trial? The KR three have bought out their crimes with dirty money raised from racketeering, illegal logging, the ruby and sapphire trade. They could do so thanks to the grotesque corruption of the Hun Sen government.</p> <p>Prime Minister Hun Sen has stated that he seeks a Cambodian solution to the war crimes problem. It would be an insult to Cambodia's dignity if international judges had the final say over Cambodians, he said. The prime minister is a crook, and a nasty one, too. Those who cross the path of Hun Sen should take care. On 9 July 1998, Reuters carried the following story about someone who did so. His name was Thong Sophal, and he worked for the opposition grouping, FUNCINPEC, opposed to Hun Sen's party. The wire story detailed what had happened to Thong Sophal: 'His eyes had been gouged out, his head smashed in, the skin had been stripped from his lower legs and all his fingers and one ear had been cut off.' Police said they suspected Sophal had killed himself. By gouging out his own eyes? Then smashing his own head in? Then skinning his groin? His fingers? And then chopping off his ear? That's how you commit suicide, Cambodian style. You challenge the Hun Sen regime.</p> <p>One of Hun Sen's closest financial backers is Theng Bunma. He may appear a hero to all air passengers. When Royal Air Cambodge lost his baggage on a flight from Hong Kong, 'Wild Theng' lost his temper. He told reporters after the incident: 'The airline staff were insolent. Had they worked for me, I would have shot them in the head. I sent my bodyguard out for the 9mm Biretta. I could have ordered the.44 Magnum, but I only wanted the tyre, not the whole plane.' And then Wild Theng shot the plane's tyre out.</p> <p>The Chinese government, which bankrolled the KR from 1979 until embarrassingly recently, in particular did not want an international war crimes tribunal. The gossip in Phnom Penh is that they gave Hun Sen $200 million in soft loans, the going rate for not having a war crimes tribunal. They deny this, of course.</p> <p>There's no doubt about the loan and a further $18 million provided to Chinese companies to invest in joint ventures. The Phnom Penh daily reported: 'Work on the cement plant, a joint venture with local entrepreneur Theng Bunma had already begun.' It's that name again.</p> <p>Professor Stephen Hedler, a Cambodian scholar at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said: 'It's highly unlikely that Hun Sen can be turned around. He's been prepared to have a trial or not have trial depending on the highest bid, and China and its friends are willing to give him economic benefits, security guarantees and diplomatic support that the US can't offer.'</p> <p>There's more, and it's worse. The real push for a proper international trial of the KR killers has to come from the governments of the United States and Britain. But both were horribly compromised because of their enmity towards the Vietnamese. When the Vietnamese took Phnom Penh in 1979, America and Britain sided with the opposition, the KR. America and Britain left the KR squatting in its seat at the United Nations for years. They even gave money and weapons training to the KR's allies, effectively helping the KR itself. If they raise the ante too much, then this sorry episode of realpolitik will be exposed to the full glare of daylight for the first time, and there are few officials in the State Department and the Foreign Office who would welcome that.</p> <p>So no one important wants a war crimes trial in Cambodia. The KR killers have bought out Hun Sen. The Chinese government has helped out, too. The Americans and the British have reasons not to try very hard. And the Cambodians? These beautiful people, raped and scarred by one of the worst regimes since Hitler? They're not important.</p> <p>Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan spend much of their time in a compound to the west of Pailin. It's a quiet place with more than a hint of menace. We dillied and dallied a little too long, and then - mindful of the guidebook - we got in a car and started to hurry away. A big 4x4 swung out of the compound gates and followed us down the road, through the minefields. The 4x4 overtook us, and moved on, but for a sliver of time we felt something of the terror, and the utter powerlessness, of the ordinary Cambodian faced with something out of their dark past.</p> <p>The crooner of Pailin can croon on.</p>",

Cooking for the KR leadership required diplomatic skills. Ta Mok hated stinky fish sauce. Nuon Chea (another KR boss, still at liberty) 'wouldn't eat soup without stinky fish sauce.' She stirred her pot some more. Did he like company, having people, children, around him? 'No, he liked quiet, so he didn't like children.' She fussed over pots while, outside the caf\u00e9, a crew of miners piled up on the back of a lorry, their faces covered in red scarves to prevent them being choked by the dust. How did she protect herself in the jungle? She turned to the subject of guns. Pol Pot himself carried a small gun in his holster. The smaller the gun, the higher the rank. She went on: 'I can fire a B-40.' That's a Chinese-made, shoulder-mounted, rocket- propelled grenade with the kick of a mule. Really? 'Yes. I can fire a B-40.' What did she think about the changes to Pailin? 'I'd like to have the B-40, and start with the casino over there. These people are bad. They bring thievery into our area.' They were only gambling, not mass murdering. The Blue Dragon is the best joint in town. It's where it jumps in Pailin. You can feast on Frog Deep Fried Pepper, Spicy Fish Cat, Spicy Frog Mango and Beef Grille Oil, and wash it down with the very best Scottish whisky malts (made in Thailand) and Tiger beer, in the company of Pol Pot's old propaganda apparatchik, Kong Deung, while listening to - what else? - The Spice Girls' 'Wannabe'. Kong used to broadcast the crudest, most bilious hate on Radio LNADK (National Army Radio of Democratic Kampuchea) and is an important accessory to the extinction of 1.5 million people. He articulated the frenzy that led to the mass murder. For example, the Vietnamese were never called the Vietnamese but the 'contemptible savages'. Brutality, torture, murder are easy once the killing is legitimised. At the head table at the Blue Dragon, Kong seems very much at ease with himself, a fit man, in his fifties, comfortable in a pair of black pyjamas. His ring finger is weighed down by a life buoy encrusted with rubies. He takes a swig of beer, grins warmly at a girl with a slit skirt and nods along to the beat. Kong takes to the stage, microphone in hand. He opens his mouth and the metamorphosis is complete. Goodbye KR, hello Charles Aznavour. The KR crooner makes loooooove to his microphone cable, and warbles on. After the first solo number, he is accompanied by a gang of slit-skirted whores - sorry, dancers - strutting their stuff. He has switched from a Khmer version of the French chanteur to, put your hands together please, Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes. Earlier, Kong showed us around his radio station, sited on the top of the denuded purple hills, just up the road from the gutted ruins of a burnt-out tank. Kong's still the propaganda chief of the Pailin District, only these days he broadcasts 'reconciliation', not murder. 'I worked from 1980 till 1994.' (The significance of the 1980 start date is simple. That was when Pol Pol was pushed out of Phnom Penh. Odd that he only got the job in 1980, though, specially since he joined the KR in 1974. Very odd.) 'There were six staff. We received the international news, and wrote a short report. Pol Pot was difficult to work with, to follow his ideology' - though, to be fair to Kong, he managed that feat for 14 years, by his own admittance. Everyone suffered during Pol Pot's terror. Kong himself lost six members of his family, his father, two brothers and three sisters. Two died of starvation; the rest during forced labour. And yet he survived, and lived to croon. Also at the high table at the Blue Dragon was Pol Pot's interpreter for eight years, Mea Makk, an elliptical and enigmatic creep who picked his teeth whenever he was asked a difficult question about the bad old days. At first, he'd fought shy of a chat with The Observer. 'Can we have lunch?' 'No, I am too busy putting up propaganda for International Women's Day\u0085' But later he joined our table at the Blue Dragon. Ask him about what he did when Pol Pot was in power, and you are treated to some industrial-strength lying. 'I was just a clerk\u0085 we had no freedom to express ourselves\u0085 we just wanted to find the formula to unite.' Mea Makk was there when Pol Pot met His Excellency the President of the People's Republic of China. To say that he was suffering from selective amnesia would be something of an understatement. The crooner who murdered with his mouth and the creep who interpreted for Brother Number One ate and drank their way through the Blue Dragon's menu, $65 for food and $105 for drink. One has to remember that the KR, at the height of its power, was thumpingly puritan. Even as late as March 1997, visitors to Pailin were greeted with the following admonishment: 'Welcome, new people - the following things are not allowed in this zone: thievery, prostitution and gambling.' At the end of Kong's crooning session, one of the dancers, sporting enough lipstick to paint the Forth Bridge, anointed him with a garland of paper chains. The crowd of ex-KR killers, gem miners, illegal loggers, whores and drunks were ecstatic. And the murdered 1.5 million? Dead men don't clap. So how come the crooner and the interpreter live in liberty and comparative luxury, given what they did, who they worked for? They are small fry. Bigger fish are at liberty, too. To understand why, one must realise that Cambodia is one of the most damaged societies on earth. The physical damage is easy to recognise - the burnt forests, the mined countryside, the lunar roads, the broken bodies. Ta Mok, now in jail awaiting his show trial, has only one leg. Hun Sen, a dodgy crook with a hint of viciousness, who happens to be Cambodia's prime minister, has only one eye. Prum Sou, a former KR junior commander, has only one arm. Duol Sareoun, another commander, has one eye. The psychological damage is much harder to recognise but more profound. People live in the present tense. A whole generation of people from their late twenties upwards have no proper sense of society, or the future. They have lived through a time when you had to survive from minute to minute. The English manager of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Phnom Penh - easily the best bar in the world - told me that he had to sack a Cambodian just the day before, a man, an excellent worker, who had been with him for four years. He had been stealing, big time, and thrown away the chances of a good income for years to come. A wire-agency chief told an almost identical story: 'This country looks so beautiful, so lovely. The people have real grace. But get to know them a little, spend time here a little, and you begin to realise that every adult has been through appalling traumas. A whole generation is crazy. They're all fucked.' Justice would help, but justice for the KR killers has been denied all the way long the line, for pernicious and unnecessary reasons. The KR mind-fuck was intensified one appalling day in 1997 when news broke that Pol Pot had died of a heart attack, cheating his people of the trial he so richly deserved. Nevertheless, Pol Pot suffered a pretty miserable end. The people who did for Pol Pot were not the forces of law and order, still less the diplomats of the international community. They were the tree detectives of Global Witness and freelance journalist called Nate Thayer, whose state of mind has never quite been the same since a car he was travelling in went over an anti-tank mine. Global Witness closed down the illegal logging trade between western Cambodia, the area around Pailin controlled by the KR, and Thailand, thanks to its detailed and accurate reporting. The KR slowly began to run out of money to fund its grisly guerrilla campaign against the Phnom Penh government. In 1997, Ta Mok arrested Pol Pol and revealed the prisoner to Nate Thayer. The journalist ran the story on Voice of America, a station which the ex-Brother Number One used to listen to. He died of a heart attack that night. Thayer, over a drink in a bar in Thailand, said: 'I killed Pot Pot, you know.' You don't argue with anyone who has survived an anti-tank mine. From 1996 onwards, senior KR commanders had started to defect. The first to go was Ieng Sary, or Brother 81 - the numbers are a poor guide to proximity to power - who decamped from the Khmer Rouge, taking his troops with him. The soldiers voted with their feet. The last to successfully switch sides was Brother Number Two, ideologist Nuon Chea, and Pol Pot's foreign minister, Khieu Samphan. They came over at Christmas 1998. That left Ta Mok, who was the last to jump and is to be punished by a trial, of sorts. The insult to humanity is a simple one: if 1.5 million people were killed by the Khmer Rouge, how come three surviving KR leaders - Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea - are still at liberty? In Nazi terms, it is as if Goering, Goebbels and Himmler were wandering around Bavaria at liberty, while only Franz Stangl was charged for war crimes. The evidence against Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea is compelling. The Documentation Centre of Cambodia has compiled a stack of smoking-gun documents from the paperwork the KR left behind, showing that the top three knew all about torture and murder. For Brother Nuon? File 734, 'confession of Sieng Pauy alias Sean', two notes sent to Brother Nuon, document dated 9 November 1977: 'Concerning the four questions above, although I pressed him to answer, he did not answer, but he did once tortured.' For Ieng Sary? File N0001158, 'telegram 21, report by comrade Chhon to Brother Pol [Pot], on the arrest and killing of the Vietnamese who spied and hid themselves in the forest, and on the arrest and torture of those who opposed Angkar's [another name for the KR leadership] dam-building plan.' This report was copied to Ieng Sary. For Khieu Samphan? File upon file, some of the paperwork originating from Comrade Duch, the master of the torture centre at Tuol Sleng. One of the exhibits at Tuol Sleng is a 3D map of Cambodia, vaguely reminiscent of the maps made of shells at seaside resorts. Only this map is made of skulls. So why no trial? The KR three have bought out their crimes with dirty money raised from racketeering, illegal logging, the ruby and sapphire trade. They could do so thanks to the grotesque corruption of the Hun Sen government. Prime Minister Hun Sen has stated that he seeks a Cambodian solution to the war crimes problem. It would be an insult to Cambodia's dignity if international judges had the final say over Cambodians, he said. The prime minister is a crook, and a nasty one, too. Those who cross the path of Hun Sen should take care. On 9 July 1998, Reuters carried the following story about someone who did so. His name was Thong Sophal, and he worked for the opposition grouping, FUNCINPEC, opposed to Hun Sen's party. The wire story detailed what had happened to Thong Sophal: 'His eyes had been gouged out, his head smashed in, the skin had been stripped from his lower legs and all his fingers and one ear had been cut off.' Police said they suspected Sophal had killed himself. By gouging out his own eyes? Then smashing his own head in? Then skinning his groin? His fingers? And then chopping off his ear? That's how you commit suicide, Cambodian style. You challenge the Hun Sen regime. One of Hun Sen's closest financial backers is Theng Bunma. He may appear a hero to all air passengers. When Royal Air Cambodge lost his baggage on a flight from Hong Kong, 'Wild Theng' lost his temper. He told reporters after the incident: 'The airline staff were insolent. Had they worked for me, I would have shot them in the head. I sent my bodyguard out for the 9mm Biretta. I could have ordered the.44 Magnum, but I only wanted the tyre, not the whole plane.' And then Wild Theng shot the plane's tyre out. The Chinese government, which bankrolled the KR from 1979 until embarrassingly recently, in particular did not want an international war crimes tribunal. The gossip in Phnom Penh is that they gave Hun Sen $200 million in soft loans, the going rate for not having a war crimes tribunal. They deny this, of course. There's no doubt about the loan and a further $18 million provided to Chinese companies to invest in joint ventures. The Phnom Penh daily reported: 'Work on the cement plant, a joint venture with local entrepreneur Theng Bunma had already begun.' It's that name again. Professor Stephen Hedler, a Cambodian scholar at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said: 'It's highly unlikely that Hun Sen can be turned around. He's been prepared to have a trial or not have trial depending on the highest bid, and China and its friends are willing to give him economic benefits, security guarantees and diplomatic support that the US can't offer.' There's more, and it's worse. The real push for a proper international trial of the KR killers has to come from the governments of the United States and Britain. But both were horribly compromised because of their enmity towards the Vietnamese. When the Vietnamese took Phnom Penh in 1979, America and Britain sided with the opposition, the KR. America and Britain left the KR squatting in its seat at the United Nations for years. They even gave money and weapons training to the KR's allies, effectively helping the KR itself. If they raise the ante too much, then this sorry episode of realpolitik will be exposed to the full glare of daylight for the first time, and there are few officials in the State Department and the Foreign Office who would welcome that. So no one important wants a war crimes trial in Cambodia. The KR killers have bought out Hun Sen. The Chinese government has helped out, too. The Americans and the British have reasons not to try very hard. And the Cambodians? These beautiful people, raped and scarred by one of the worst regimes since Hitler? They're not important. Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan spend much of their time in a compound to the west of Pailin. It's a quiet place with more than a hint of menace. We dillied and dallied a little too long, and then - mindful of the guidebook - we got in a car and started to hurry away. A big 4x4 swung out of the compound gates and followed us down the road, through the minefields. The 4x4 overtook us, and moved on, but for a sliver of time we felt something of the terror, and the utter powerlessness, of the ordinary Cambodian faced with something out of their dark past. The crooner of Pailin can croon on.",

More than a motorway service area, Clacket Lane is the epitome of Mr Tony's New Britain. You can tell from the name itself, quivering with resonance. Clacket Lane. Say it. Clacket Lane. Hear the tappet-click of an aged slackjaw in NHS dentures munching through a microwaved service-station pie: adipocere pastry, centrifuged meat slurry, cloacal hogo, 'Good enough for the likes of us, can't be bothered with that mucked-about foreign stuff.'</p> <p>Clacket Lane Road Chef. The Wigan Pier of our time, stuck like a salesman on the M25, straddling the route of an old Roman road, a bit of hump-and-fossa heritage lying somewhere beneath the lorry park and the fuel pumps, obliterated now by landscaped banks and yawning truck drivers but still commemorated in the Clacket Lane shopping what? Mall, area, outlet, bit?</p> <p>Never mind; there's the Travelling Through Time display - squint at the pot shards, see the Samian ware, chumble on your burga while you peer at the Artist's reconstruction: clean-limbed Roman soldiers marching by a thatched village while cheery Saxons (plaits, cross-garters) smile and wave. In reality, they'd have been bunging rocks, or lurking out of sight, in the midden, sharpening sticks and dipping them in pig shit - but this isn't reality; this is Clacket Lane.</p> <p>At least the Romans were going somewhere. The M25 is the greatest non-road in Britain, a vaporous hell of HGVs and sticky-arsed salesmen, of burping geezers in dodgy Transits, of circulating bailiffs up to no good, bewildered wholesale newsagents, cashiered conveyancers, gynaecologists' molls, you, me, us. Clacket Lane hunches over the least-anywhere section on this nowhere road; double-nowhere, a modern Erewhon; the Channel Tunnel at one end, Heathrow and Gatwick at the other: places you only go to to get to other places.</p> <p>But it's an Erewhon with toilets, a Nowhere in which (although you can't get a simple cup of espresso without it being filtered through the reeking kidney of some marketing idiot's 'branding' process, in this case the 'Caf\u00e9 Continental') you might possibly find what you need - a lavatory, a tank of unleaded, some edible calories - to give you the endurance to get the hell out of there and on to somewhere with a point.</p> <p>But look: here, in the car park - the big sign: Weekend Breaks: Two Nights for the Price of One, \u00a349.95 a double room. You thought a night in a motorway service station was a distress-purchase, something you did when you were knackered and still had 500 miles to go, when the Dexedrine ran out, the weather closed in, the options vanished: somewhere sad, cheap bastards spent Christmas Eve when nobody wanted to be with them.</p> <p>See, though: you were wrong. Clacket Lane wants you not just to use it but to want it; it wants it to be your real; it wants to wake up with you. But who would go? What kind of degenerate would say to some poor blameless wife or giggling high-buttocked popsie, 'Hey, honey, fancy a two-night, double-room weekend break at the Clacket Lane Road Chef Lodge? Come on - you know you want it\u0085'? And what kind of a person would agree?</p> <p>There, on the car-park banner, is a clarion call to an anthropological extravaganza. Love among the Mondeo folk, surreptitious venery with a Barclaycard and an itch; a grim mosaic of Rennies and Trevira, in-car accessories and petrol-station bonus points, of Vodafone and Classic FM: unfathomable courtship rituals and unwholesome sexual mannerisms brought to bear on some purse-lipped office person with a special acrylic Office Cardigan and a snap-shut handbag but nevertheless with thighs, with breasts, with nobody else at home and nowhere to go at the weekend\u0085 and so off they go, \u00a349.95, the All-Day Brunch only \u00a34.99 and the competing allure of the Wimpy Classic King Size: Good Things in Life Are Worth Waiting For.</p> <p>They're there. They must be. See: at 10 o'clock at night, there's condensation on some of the car windows in the sodium-lit car park. Their bonnets are cool. People are staying here. The receptionist is playing solitaire on the computer - Seahaven Towers. I've got that one. How are you doing? - I don't know. I just play; don't bother with the score. Can I help you? - What's the two-nights-for-the-price-of-one deal? - You get two nights for the price of one. Ooh look; you've stayed before.</p> <p>My name comes up on the screen, but not my address, which is somewhere on the southern edge of the commuter badlands. Why would anyone who lived so close by stay in Clacket Lane? Mondeo Man. Cardie Woman. Must be. It must be true: my avatar, my doppelg\u00e4nger, here with Sheila from Small Claims (Processing).</p> <p>But there's no trace of them in the room. You'd think you could detect it: a vibration of guilt, a faint nose-twitch of the sadness pheromone, a sensibility of bed-wrestling and then the morning's retreat, 'We mustn't do this again' and 'No it was lovely but we've too much to lose' and 'Well cheers then, um, see you at the' and 'Yes, at the, yes, office, right' and 'But I don't regret it' and 'No nor do I, no, I'm glad we' but they do regret it. And they're not glad.</p> <p>The beds are curiously high: twins beds, an immovable 'unit' bolted to the wall, obstruere perfugia improborum. A white, faintly clinical towel rail in the bathroom, and squeezy-bottles of Lux liquid soap; anything else ('Shampoo, Conditioner, Combs, Toothpaste, Toothbrush, Razors, Shaving Foam, Paracetamol, Tampon Towel, Pens, Writing paper, Hairspray, Flannel, Deodorant, Soap, Tights') is available for sale at Reception 'For your convenience', though it would be hard to imagine anything less convenient than putting one's strides to cook in the Corby 4400 then - oops! - having to stumble down to Reception, dirty, greasy-haired, foul-mouthed, migrainous, bleeding, unshaven and aching to write home.</p> <p>Better, instead, to hose down with squeezy Lux then read the Literature while the car-crumpled trousers flatten in the Corby. Clacket Lane couches its delights in that constipated, Sta-Prest, massage-parlour register peculiar to the 'hospitality industry'. Things offer a 'full range' and are staffed '24 hours a day', as though there's some other possibility ('24 hours a fruit gum'). Has any human being apart from a strangulated-at-birth 'hospitality' executive ever used the word 'beverage' even in their deepest fantasies? Do actual people ever say: 'Oh look, Maureen, the bedroom telephone offers a self dial; we must request the line to be activated'? Is there anywhere outside Hospitality World where people require facilities, consume items, refer to adjacent instructions, prefer a light snack, visit the foyer area? Where 'a lot more' - as in 'The main shop has a comprehensive range of newspapers, magazines, toiletries, sweets, tobacco, gifts and a lot more' - means 'not much else unless you fancy a model steam locomotive carved out of coal'?</p> <p>Out across the cold brick walkway, the night-time main building (called 'the Main Building') is already deserted, except for the ghost of motorway food and a dozen shouting, boisterous Essex teenagers on a spree. PhoneBitz is closed; the Wimpy Bar is closed (the best things in life are worth waiting for, but not until morning); the Bocca della Verita, a creepy fibreglass mouth with a slot, yabbers away insanely to itself and eats my coin.</p> <p>I sense Sheila, my ghostly popsie, sliding into the deserted restaurant beside me for a romantic dinner: no wine (we're British; we can't be trusted; how would it be if everyone did it?), but a rosy-cheeked innocent beaming behind the empty hot-trays. 'Chef, can do you a lovely Mixed Grill' - and 'lovely' must be another word with a special Hosp. Ind. meaning because the lamb chop is like an old sheepskin slipper, the dead sausage has soft insides like a Marmite-flavoured dog turd, its skin not an actual skin but a dried, split version of the interior, only to be rendered edible by a thick slathering of Kiehl's No 1 Lip Balm. The food is so terrible that one wonders who the hell is in charge of the buying policy, and whether they go home at the end of the day pleased with what they've done.</p> <p>And then you realise it's probably the same 'executive' who chooses the piped music. Perhaps the chefs never wanted, really, to be chefs. Perhaps it's just a living. But the music: to play even this drool requires skill, acquired by people who have spent a long time training, while the other children were out having fun, smoking, getting laid. People who were their parents' pride and hope.</p> <p>Like the food, this is music stripped of all affect (unlike techno, dance, trance, jungle, D&amp;B, whatever, which is affect stripped of all music) and it's almost a relief when, at just gone midnight, the music goes insane: a ghostly Tyrolean fish-slapping dance played on the weasel by someone who has heard about music but never actually heard any. For me and my imaginary mistress, it's like the final shuddering of a dutiful coitus ('We're here now so we might as well'): not an occasion of pleasure, merely an excuse to stop striving and go to sleep.</p> <p>In the lorry park, they are all asleep, too, undisturbed by the corporate advertising blasting out of the petrol forecourt television sets in between fatuous burps of falsely urgent news. HH Young Transport Ltd, Southampton, Huddersfield; Hungarocamion, Budapest; the irascible Read Boardall Transport, sticker-laden ('Fair Play on Fuel!' 'Why Tax Our Transport Industry to Death!' 'Warning! Steering Rear Axle!'); Ideal Standard; Meachers of Southampton: all the curtains are drawn in the cabs, the bunks down, the portable televisions flickering, the lorry men settling down to uneasy dreams of home and breakfast, the road unrolling before them as they sleep.</p> <p>In my room, sleep comes less easily, despite the soothing knowledge that either this, or tomorrow, night is free. Sheila the Avatar rusts in the next bed, waiting like a revenant for me to creep past the Unit and make her incarnate. Eventually I fall asleep, only to wake an hour later aware of an odd dampness about the sheets, something faintly feverish, an emanation of tormented salesmen which turns out to be a plastic mattress-protector, installed as a barrier against the bodily fluids of night inhabitants, frotted or fretted out in the nervous small hours. You know you've passed through some sort of taste barrier (heading in the wrong direction) when you find yourself in a room where it assumed that, one way or another, you are going to wet the bed.</p> <p>At 6am, the lorry park is waking up. Drivers yawn and stretch in the grey, scudding drizzle; curtains are drawn back; scratching men line up for cups of tea or lean against their cabs, chatting. Bit by bit, the loads move off: meat, lavatories, fastenings, biscuits, parts. Commerce gives way to eager tourism. In the breakfasting restaurant, a chirpy six-pack of respectable middle-aged women chatter and giggle over their Full English Breakfasts, on their way to Leeds Castle. A sour-faced Belgian family purse their lips over their sausages and scan, hopelessly, the wad of brochures of Things To Do: BowlPlex Brighton, The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells, Bosham Walk Craft Centre, The South Coast Museum of Shops, Eastbourne ('How We Lived Then'), Howletts and Lympne Wild Animal Parks ('There is always something new at Howletts and Lympne').</p> <p>Clacket Lane comes to life like a numb limb. PhoneBitz opens its doors and I flirt briefly with a Champ (Hands Free into Battery: Best for Driver, Wonderful to combine mobile phone battery with hands free and charger function). Things are cranking up in the Shop, a clog-voiced American singing, ' If I say the right words/At the right time ' (in homage to Mr Tony, perhaps) while the women at the tills start on another day of shifting fags, tabloids, Shirt's \u00a33.99, Beanie Baby luminous-green teddies (I imagine buying my ghostly Sheila a copy of BeanBag World and watching her face light up), Mrs Bridges' Afternoon Treats, Macallan marmalade, novelty jam, wristwatches, dusters, smutty novels ( Kiss the Lash and Domination Inc, just the thing for those lonely traffic jams) and Thermos flasks. A fiftysomething man (long, greasy grey hair, paunch, basketball jacket) is buying an egg sandwich and a Bruce Springsteen tape: man, food and music in perfect harmony.</p> <p>I force down a Full English to the accompaniment of 'Pussycat Pussycat' played by Bulgarina microtonal bagpipes, Alpenhorn and expiring rhino. If this were the morning after, how would it be? It would be like this. It would be a total lack of style, it would be nothing done without an eye on profit, it would be abandonment dressed up as hospitality; it would be transience, tat, low cloud, the dispossessed in fleeces and bewildered expressions; it would be children shouting 'fuck' at the Time Bomb Jaw Breaker bubble-gum machine, Miller's Cornish Pasties TWO for \u00a32.49, 'Customer's Own Food and Drink May Not be Consumed in the Restaurant', everything in little packets, sugar with a bad cartoon of Winston Churchill on the packet. It would be procurement executives, brochures, corporate identity meetings, branding, notices. It would be Britain 2000.</p>",

Clacket Lane hunches over the least-anywhere section on this nowhere road; double-nowhere, a modern Erewhon; the Channel Tunnel at one end, Heathrow and Gatwick at the other: places you only go to to get to other places. But it's an Erewhon with toilets, a Nowhere in which (although you can't get a simple cup of espresso without it being filtered through the reeking kidney of some marketing idiot's 'branding' process, in this case the 'Caf\u00e9 Continental') you might possibly find what you need - a lavatory, a tank of unleaded, some edible calories - to give you the endurance to get the hell out of there and on to somewhere with a point. But look: here, in the car park - the big sign: Weekend Breaks: Two Nights for the Price of One, \u00a349.95 a double room. You thought a night in a motorway service station was a distress-purchase, something you did when you were knackered and still had 500 miles to go, when the Dexedrine ran out, the weather closed in, the options vanished: somewhere sad, cheap bastards spent Christmas Eve when nobody wanted to be with them. See, though: you were wrong. Clacket Lane wants you not just to use it but to want it; it wants it to be your real; it wants to wake up with you. But who would go? What kind of degenerate would say to some poor blameless wife or giggling high-buttocked popsie, 'Hey, honey, fancy a two-night, double-room weekend break at the Clacket Lane Road Chef Lodge? Come on - you know you want it\u0085'? And what kind of a person would agree? There, on the car-park banner, is a clarion call to an anthropological extravaganza. Love among the Mondeo folk, surreptitious venery with a Barclaycard and an itch; a grim mosaic of Rennies and Trevira, in-car accessories and petrol-station bonus points, of Vodafone and Classic FM: unfathomable courtship rituals and unwholesome sexual mannerisms brought to bear on some purse-lipped office person with a special acrylic Office Cardigan and a snap-shut handbag but nevertheless with thighs, with breasts, with nobody else at home and nowhere to go at the weekend\u0085 and so off they go, \u00a349.95, the All-Day Brunch only \u00a34.99 and the competing allure of the Wimpy Classic King Size: Good Things in Life Are Worth Waiting For. They're there. They must be. See: at 10 o'clock at night, there's condensation on some of the car windows in the sodium-lit car park. Their bonnets are cool. People are staying here. The receptionist is playing solitaire on the computer - Seahaven Towers. I've got that one. How are you doing? - I don't know. I just play; don't bother with the score. Can I help you? - What's the two-nights-for-the-price-of-one deal? - You get two nights for the price of one. Ooh look; you've stayed before. My name comes up on the screen, but not my address, which is somewhere on the southern edge of the commuter badlands. Why would anyone who lived so close by stay in Clacket Lane? Mondeo Man. Cardie Woman. Must be. It must be true: my avatar, my doppelg\u00e4nger, here with Sheila from Small Claims (Processing). But there's no trace of them in the room. You'd think you could detect it: a vibration of guilt, a faint nose-twitch of the sadness pheromone, a sensibility of bed-wrestling and then the morning's retreat, 'We mustn't do this again' and 'No it was lovely but we've too much to lose' and 'Well cheers then, um, see you at the' and 'Yes, at the, yes, office, right' and 'But I don't regret it' and 'No nor do I, no, I'm glad we' but they do regret it. And they're not glad. The beds are curiously high: twins beds, an immovable 'unit' bolted to the wall, obstruere perfugia improborum. A white, faintly clinical towel rail in the bathroom, and squeezy-bottles of Lux liquid soap; anything else ('Shampoo, Conditioner, Combs, Toothpaste, Toothbrush, Razors, Shaving Foam, Paracetamol, Tampon Towel, Pens, Writing paper, Hairspray, Flannel, Deodorant, Soap, Tights') is available for sale at Reception 'For your convenience', though it would be hard to imagine anything less convenient than putting one's strides to cook in the Corby 4400 then - oops! - having to stumble down to Reception, dirty, greasy-haired, foul-mouthed, migrainous, bleeding, unshaven and aching to write home. Better, instead, to hose down with squeezy Lux then read the Literature while the car-crumpled trousers flatten in the Corby. Clacket Lane couches its delights in that constipated, Sta-Prest, massage-parlour register peculiar to the 'hospitality industry'. Things offer a 'full range' and are staffed '24 hours a day', as though there's some other possibility ('24 hours a fruit gum'). Has any human being apart from a strangulated-at-birth 'hospitality' executive ever used the word 'beverage' even in their deepest fantasies? Do actual people ever say: 'Oh look, Maureen, the bedroom telephone offers a self dial; we must request the line to be activated'? Is there anywhere outside Hospitality World where people require facilities, consume items, refer to adjacent instructions, prefer a light snack, visit the foyer area? Where 'a lot more' - as in 'The main shop has a comprehensive range of newspapers, magazines, toiletries, sweets, tobacco, gifts and a lot more' - means 'not much else unless you fancy a model steam locomotive carved out of coal'? Out across the cold brick walkway, the night-time main building (called 'the Main Building') is already deserted, except for the ghost of motorway food and a dozen shouting, boisterous Essex teenagers on a spree. PhoneBitz is closed; the Wimpy Bar is closed (the best things in life are worth waiting for, but not until morning); the Bocca della Verita, a creepy fibreglass mouth with a slot, yabbers away insanely to itself and eats my coin. I sense Sheila, my ghostly popsie, sliding into the deserted restaurant beside me for a romantic dinner: no wine (we're British; we can't be trusted; how would it be if everyone did it?), but a rosy-cheeked innocent beaming behind the empty hot-trays. 'Chef, can do you a lovely Mixed Grill' - and 'lovely' must be another word with a special Hosp. Ind. meaning because the lamb chop is like an old sheepskin slipper, the dead sausage has soft insides like a Marmite-flavoured dog turd, its skin not an actual skin but a dried, split version of the interior, only to be rendered edible by a thick slathering of Kiehl's No 1 Lip Balm. The food is so terrible that one wonders who the hell is in charge of the buying policy, and whether they go home at the end of the day pleased with what they've done. And then you realise it's probably the same 'executive' who chooses the piped music. Perhaps the chefs never wanted, really, to be chefs. Perhaps it's just a living. But the music: to play even this drool requires skill, acquired by people who have spent a long time training, while the other children were out having fun, smoking, getting laid. People who were their parents' pride and hope. Like the food, this is music stripped of all affect (unlike techno, dance, trance, jungle, D&amp;B, whatever, which is affect stripped of all music) and it's almost a relief when, at just gone midnight, the music goes insane: a ghostly Tyrolean fish-slapping dance played on the weasel by someone who has heard about music but never actually heard any. For me and my imaginary mistress, it's like the final shuddering of a dutiful coitus ('We're here now so we might as well'): not an occasion of pleasure, merely an excuse to stop striving and go to sleep. In the lorry park, they are all asleep, too, undisturbed by the corporate advertising blasting out of the petrol forecourt television sets in between fatuous burps of falsely urgent news. HH Young Transport Ltd, Southampton, Huddersfield; Hungarocamion, Budapest; the irascible Read Boardall Transport, sticker-laden ('Fair Play on Fuel!' 'Why Tax Our Transport Industry to Death!' 'Warning! Steering Rear Axle!'); Ideal Standard; Meachers of Southampton: all the curtains are drawn in the cabs, the bunks down, the portable televisions flickering, the lorry men settling down to uneasy dreams of home and breakfast, the road unrolling before them as they sleep. In my room, sleep comes less easily, despite the soothing knowledge that either this, or tomorrow, night is free. Sheila the Avatar rusts in the next bed, waiting like a revenant for me to creep past the Unit and make her incarnate. Eventually I fall asleep, only to wake an hour later aware of an odd dampness about the sheets, something faintly feverish, an emanation of tormented salesmen which turns out to be a plastic mattress-protector, installed as a barrier against the bodily fluids of night inhabitants, frotted or fretted out in the nervous small hours. You know you've passed through some sort of taste barrier (heading in the wrong direction) when you find yourself in a room where it assumed that, one way or another, you are going to wet the bed. At 6am, the lorry park is waking up. Drivers yawn and stretch in the grey, scudding drizzle; curtains are drawn back; scratching men line up for cups of tea or lean against their cabs, chatting. Bit by bit, the loads move off: meat, lavatories, fastenings, biscuits, parts. Commerce gives way to eager tourism. In the breakfasting restaurant, a chirpy six-pack of respectable middle-aged women chatter and giggle over their Full English Breakfasts, on their way to Leeds Castle. A sour-faced Belgian family purse their lips over their sausages and scan, hopelessly, the wad of brochures of Things To Do: BowlPlex Brighton, The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells, Bosham Walk Craft Centre, The South Coast Museum of Shops, Eastbourne ('How We Lived Then'), Howletts and Lympne Wild Animal Parks ('There is always something new at Howletts and Lympne'). Clacket Lane comes to life like a numb limb. PhoneBitz opens its doors and I flirt briefly with a Champ (Hands Free into Battery: Best for Driver, Wonderful to combine mobile phone battery with hands free and charger function). Things are cranking up in the Shop, a clog-voiced American singing, ' If I say the right words/At the right time ' (in homage to Mr Tony, perhaps) while the women at the tills start on another day of shifting fags, tabloids, Shirt's \u00a33.99, Beanie Baby luminous-green teddies (I imagine buying my ghostly Sheila a copy of BeanBag World and watching her face light up), Mrs Bridges' Afternoon Treats, Macallan marmalade, novelty jam, wristwatches, dusters, smutty novels ( Kiss the Lash and Domination Inc, just the thing for those lonely traffic jams) and Thermos flasks. A fiftysomething man (long, greasy grey hair, paunch, basketball jacket) is buying an egg sandwich and a Bruce Springsteen tape: man, food and music in perfect harmony. I force down a Full English to the accompaniment of 'Pussycat Pussycat' played by Bulgarina microtonal bagpipes, Alpenhorn and expiring rhino. If this were the morning after, how would it be? It would be like this. It would be a total lack of style, it would be nothing done without an eye on profit, it would be abandonment dressed up as hospitality; it would be transience, tat, low cloud, the dispossessed in fleeces and bewildered expressions; it would be children shouting 'fuck' at the Time Bomb Jaw Breaker bubble-gum machine, Miller's Cornish Pasties TWO for \u00a32.49, 'Customer's Own Food and Drink May Not be Consumed in the Restaurant', everything in little packets, sugar with a bad cartoon of Winston Churchill on the packet. It would be procurement executives, brochures, corporate identity meetings, branding, notices. It would be Britain 2000.",

      "body": "<b>Sheena McDonald</b> <br> I don't remember anything about the accident last February. I've been told that I went to a lecture at BAFTA in Piccadilly. I presume I got a bus home to Islington, as that's what I usually do. I was crossing the road, and the van was on the wrong side of the road [answering an emergency call], so I can only assume I wasn't expecting anything from that direction. I was in a coma for three days and I'm told I was so badly bruised I was unrecognisable. I didn't take part in the court case which followed because I didn't have anything to say. I'm filled with incomprehension at the result [the driver was cleared of careless driving], and I'm now bringing a civil suit against the Met. It is unfinished business. <p>My first memory of Gail is a long time after she started working with me. I suffered post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) for weeks after the accident, and even after my memory began to come back it was very fragmentary, so the first time I remember meeting Gail is as an outpatient 12 weeks after the crash. She came across as a very open, informative and intelligent woman.</p> <p>When you have PTA you are conscious, but you're not aware that you're conscious. Allan, my partner, says that I first met Gail a few weeks after the injury. Apparently, she would show me everyday objects and I had to name them, and she showed me 30 and I scored three. At first, I couldn't remember anything of the 15 years before the accident. I didn't remember that my grandmother had died, or that Princess Diana had died. I didn't even know who Allan was - I thought he was a doctor. </p> <p>Gail ran a series of tests to identify which cognitive functions were impaired by the accident. A brain injury can wipe out parts of the brain. Some people in recovery can look at a chair and know it's called a chair, but they don't know what it's for, whereas others understand that it's for sitting on but they can't find the word 'chair'. </p> <p>Gail's tests showed I could understand everything my family was saying, even though I couldn't respond, so they were able to keep me informed about what they were doing, tell me what was going on in the world, and treat me as a grown-up human being instead of an invalid. </p> <p>What Gail is able to do is bring the example of others to bear so that I can see my condition in a wider context. So she'll say, 'Don't set yourself deadlines, because they're purely arbitrary, and you'll fail.'</p> <p>I'm still seeing Gail. I'm still in recovery, but I can work again now, which is great. We meet up every four to six weeks and she gives me advice. She says, 'Don't do too much; don't exceed your capabilities.' But I did from quite early on. The first broadcast I did was in November in Durban, a panel discussion. There were five Commonwealth country foreign ministers with a live audience. I sent Gail a tape of it, and she said she had been nervous about me doing this in case I had language problems.</p> <p>My most immediate problem is fatigue, but I can work around it. I'm creeping back into radio and television and writing a book about the impact of a life-changing experience. I can't work the 16-hour days I used to, but I don't think anyone should.</p> <p><b>Gail Robinson</b><br> I first saw Sheena at the National Hospital for Neurology about two weeks after the accident, and she was in a bad way. At that point she still had PTA. There are islands of memory, but no continuous memory - you don't know where you are or who you are. Sheena was just living in the moment for five to six weeks, so she doesn't even remember people she saw on a daily basis. I was only vaguely familiar to her.</p> <p>I saw her every few days, but was seeing her family more than her, as she was asleep for most of the day. My job was to assess the impairment of her cognitive skills - memory, language, concentration, visual perception - everything was severely impaired, and I was not optimistic, which is why Sheena is quite a miracle. </p> <p>At the beginning of April, Sheena went to Edinburgh as an inpatient at a rehabilitation unit. When she left here, she was still having difficulty finding single words, let alone stringing sentences together. But in August, when I saw her again, that had more or less resolved itself. I was floored; everything had improved to the point where she was almost at ceiling on formal tests.</p> <p>One of the things that definitely went in Sheena's favour is that she is intelligent, with a lot of resources and skills. She is also very motivated, organised and determined. She's got a very supportive family, and her partner would give her daily exercises and structures. Sheena would sometimes get a little frustrated, but she's never been really depressed. Anxiety and depression can undermine your progress.</p> <p>I trained in Canberra, Australia, which is where I'm from. I was working as a research assistant in cognitive neuropsychology, which triggered my interest, so during the last three years of training I decided to specialise. I liked the combination of the clinical and the theoretical, applying the knowledge we have of the behaviour of the brain to real people. </p> <p>I moved here four years ago, as London is really the centre of research in this field, and my job is a combination of clinical and research and teaching, my speciality being case studies in cognitive neuropsychology. My job is partly educational. So with Sheena, who is now getting back to her life, it is really listening to what problems she might be having. Sheena is very focused, which is her personality as well as what she's trained herself to be, and that's such a strength in somebody who's recovering. </p> <p>My role is to give her strategies for how to get round problems. For example, if she's about to do a programme, we might talk about how to prepare in terms of having her memory at its best and all the words she needs at the tip of her tongue. Once she gets the skills and knows all the tricks of the trade, then she won't need me. I get a lot of job satisfaction seeing her doing so well. Sometimes you really enjoy patients, and that's the case with Sheena. </p> <p>\u0095 Sheena McDonald's story will feature in Dispatches: Deadly Pursuit on Channel 4 on Thursday</p>",

      "body": "<p>The pain was excruciating. My lower abdomen felt as though it was possessed by demons armed with chainsaws, and performing acts of savagery upon my internal organs. I knew what the matter was, of course. The Return of Pancreatitis. Sweating profusely and agony-wracked, I cursed myself, hated myself, for ignoring the strict instructions of the medical profession. I had been warned years before, and on several occasions, to give up drinking. But I had ignored this. I seemed unable to settle down to a day's writing without the 'tender counselling' offered by the whisky bottle. I had arrived, pathetically dishevelled, upon the sorry shores of alcoholism. I was a shame and disgrace to friends, family, my darling wife - even to my cat. I was an alcoholic (I am an alcoholic, as Elizabeth Taylor would say). I was an alcoholic - and I was about to die.</p> <p>Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, an elongated, tapered gland located behind the stomach. This secretes digestive enzymes and the hormones insulin and glucagon. With the onset of the disease, it is thought, enzymes normally secreted by the pancreas in an inactive form become activated and start to digest the pancreatic tissue. This process is called 'autodigestion' and causes swelling, haemorrhage and damage to the blood vessels. In other words, the pancreas eats itself. The death rate among pancreatitis sufferers is extremely high.</p> <p>My recollections of what happened to me as a patient in London's Charing Cross Hospital are vague and hazy. But there I was, dosed to the gills on industrial-strength morphine and whatnot, in a coma. Things looked bleak. I was in intensive care, with my wife and sister building defences around my bed to prevent the Australian nurses from snagging their tights on one of the many tubes inserted into my weedy body. (The nurses from Sweden were more gentle.) My parents were there, too. Because of their inclination to soothe themselves with whisky and vodka while the four horsemen galloped towards me, we were nicknamed 'The Pancreatitis Family'.</p> <p>Such is the state of the National Health Service that the hospital was forced to throw its doors open to almost anyone prepared to pay for the use of the surroundings. Apparently, while I lay there unaware of anything happening around me, there was a television crew stationed just outside my ward creating scenes for a small-screen item called The New Professionals. This has just started on Sky, so if you have satellite access and are completely bonkers, you might just catch a glimpse of me at death's door as Edward Woodward, and 'Bodie' and 'Doyle' tear around the corridors shooting their fake guns and growling.</p> <p>It gets worse. The medical staff didn't know whether my brain had suffered from my unpleasant brush at the scythe of the Reaper. There seemed to be more than a chance that Tom Hibbert, that bloke that used to be able to answer all the questions on University Challenge and to interview people like Margaret Thatcher and Dennis Potter and Melvyn Bragg, might lose his marbles. People would come to visit me, and I would lie there spouting monstrous nonsense, or uttering nothing at all. One day Kevin Keegan, then manager of Fulham FC (whose ground, Craven Cottage, is just down the road from the hospital), dropped by on some 'caring sharing' PR visit. There he was at my bedside, and God only knows what I said to him, but when friends came to visit shortly after, I told them about my cosy meeting with the once be-permed wonder. They left the ward somewhat distressed and told my wife, 'Poor old Tom. He's got delusions that Kevin Keegan has mysteriously appeared by his bedside.'</p> <p>I was in a bed with a sign reading 'Nil by Mouth' attached to it - not that I felt much like eating or drinking. My weight had fallen from 8.5 stone (at 5ft 10in, that's pretty weedy anyway, but I like being thin) to around five. I must have looked magnificent. And then\u0085 it was all over. Thanks to the wonders of modern medicine (and thanks to the people who sat beside me in my hours of need), I am ALIVE.</p> <p>And, do you know, being alive isn't too ghastly after all. It took months to recuperate and to walk properly again, after weeks of inactivity. The doctors have told me I can never drink again. Just one more Bells could kill me. I feel guilty for the expense I have been to the National Health Service and for the distress I have caused my family. Besides, not drinking can be a hoot. I don't miss the collection of bores in the pub at all, and at parties when everybody else starts to spout nonsense and act the giddy goat, I stand there basking in a warm glow of superiority.

      "bodyText": "The pain was excruciating. My lower abdomen felt as though it was possessed by demons armed with chainsaws, and performing acts of savagery upon my internal organs. I knew what the matter was, of course. The Return of Pancreatitis. Sweating profusely and agony-wracked, I cursed myself, hated myself, for ignoring the strict instructions of the medical profession. I had been warned years before, and on several occasions, to give up drinking. But I had ignored this. I seemed unable to settle down to a day's writing without the 'tender counselling' offered by the whisky bottle. I had arrived, pathetically dishevelled, upon the sorry shores of alcoholism. I was a shame and disgrace to friends, family, my darling wife - even to my cat. I was an alcoholic (I am an alcoholic, as Elizabeth Taylor would say). I was an alcoholic - and I was about to die. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, an elongated, tapered gland located behind the stomach. This secretes digestive enzymes and the hormones insulin and glucagon. With the onset of the disease, it is thought, enzymes normally secreted by the pancreas in an inactive form become activated and start to digest the pancreatic tissue. This process is called 'autodigestion' and causes swelling, haemorrhage and damage to the blood vessels. In other words, the pancreas eats itself. The death rate among pancreatitis sufferers is extremely high. My recollections of what happened to me as a patient in London's Charing Cross Hospital are vague and hazy. But there I was, dosed to the gills on industrial-strength morphine and whatnot, in a coma. Things looked bleak. I was in intensive care, with my wife and sister building defences around my bed to prevent the Australian nurses from snagging their tights on one of the many tubes inserted into my weedy body. (The nurses from Sweden were more gentle.) My parents were there, too. Because of their inclination to soothe themselves with whisky and vodka while the four horsemen galloped towards me, we were nicknamed 'The Pancreatitis Family'. Such is the state of the National Health Service that the hospital was forced to throw its doors open to almost anyone prepared to pay for the use of the surroundings. Apparently, while I lay there unaware of anything happening around me, there was a television crew stationed just outside my ward creating scenes for a small-screen item called The New Professionals. This has just started on Sky, so if you have satellite access and are completely bonkers, you might just catch a glimpse of me at death's door as Edward Woodward, and 'Bodie' and 'Doyle' tear around the corridors shooting their fake guns and growling. It gets worse. The medical staff didn't know whether my brain had suffered from my unpleasant brush at the scythe of the Reaper. There seemed to be more than a chance that Tom Hibbert, that bloke that used to be able to answer all the questions on University Challenge and to interview people like Margaret Thatcher and Dennis Potter and Melvyn Bragg, might lose his marbles. People would come to visit me, and I would lie there spouting monstrous nonsense, or uttering nothing at all. One day Kevin Keegan, then manager of Fulham FC (whose ground, Craven Cottage, is just down the road from the hospital), dropped by on some 'caring sharing' PR visit. There he was at my bedside, and God only knows what I said to him, but when friends came to visit shortly after, I told them about my cosy meeting with the once be-permed wonder. They left the ward somewhat distressed and told my wife, 'Poor old Tom. He's got delusions that Kevin Keegan has mysteriously appeared by his bedside.' I was in a bed with a sign reading 'Nil by Mouth' attached to it - not that I felt much like eating or drinking. My weight had fallen from 8.5 stone (at 5ft 10in, that's pretty weedy anyway, but I like being thin) to around five. I must have looked magnificent. And then\u0085 it was all over. Thanks to the wonders of modern medicine (and thanks to the people who sat beside me in my hours of need), I am ALIVE. And, do you know, being alive isn't too ghastly after all. It took months to recuperate and to walk properly again, after weeks of inactivity. The doctors have told me I can never drink again. Just one more Bells could kill me. I feel guilty for the expense I have been to the National Health Service and for the distress I have caused my family. Besides, not drinking can be a hoot. I don't miss the collection of bores in the pub at all, and at parties when everybody else starts to spout nonsense and act the giddy goat, I stand there basking in a warm glow of superiority. I am back to my normal (skimpy) weight, eat 'sensibly', and no longer bang my head falling down the stairs. My one concern now is that I will lose my hair. At 47, I have a full head of the stuff and have long laboured under the illusion that this was thanks to the follicle stimulation of demon alcohol. Oh well, I shall live to be 90, probably, a chrome-dome OAP. Hurrah. In celebration, I shall now light another life-enhancing cigarette.",

      "body": "<p>I've never understood where we get off sneering at the Americans for their food so. Doesn't everyone know that their cooking is, well, maybe better than ours? I understand that now we're in the full flush of culinary smuggery it doesn't quite do to suggest any nation might be superior to us in the kitchen. Good God, even the French don't get a look-in these days, so why should we even be polite about the Yanks?</p> <p>But it's not quite like that. A league table of gastronomic achievement is not to the point; this whole eating thing is not some examination compare-and-contrast exercise. It isn't about who's better, who's worse. We all have the foods that we love, and not always for culinary reasons. Is a shepherd's pie really better than a meatloaf? So much of what we feel about food is really about what we feel about our memories of eating it - and I don't say that's wrong. But it's better not to confuse the issue.</p> <p>And just as we get annoyed when foreigners think our cooking is on the watery-stew and soggy-crumble level, so Americans must get incensed at our unworried assumption that their native fare extends little beyond hamburger and chiffon pies. I've eaten better in America, admittedly in the cities, than anywhere else in the world. You know that modern British Italianate thing - I first came by it in San Francisco and then New York more than 10 years ago. And it's not surprising that America is so interesting as an eating place. There is something inevitably gastronomically rewarding about a country that bases its identity on the cultural melting pot. This is the land of fusion cooking avant la lettre.</p> <p>I don't mean to preach, not least because my weakness here is not for the modern, evolved and savvy food hot off the transatlantic menu, but for a certain sort of down-home cooking, best described as culinary-kitsch Americana. Perhaps here is the place for me to make this public confession: yes, I do own a copy of a book called Mazeltov Y'all: the Heritage of Southern Jewish Cooking. And there are many more with titles not so dissimilar on my bookshelves. Food That Really Schmecks - a Mennonite cookbook - is another of my favourites. And I'm not making fun here: I like these books because they are driven by a passionate, territorial culinary pride. You can't read them without wanting to cook their food.</p> <p>And what many different American culinary cultures seem to share, apart from the obsessive need to chronicle, is an understanding of excellent simplicity: Maine lobsters, Florida stone crabs, New Orleans pompano - no one believes it has to be messed around with to be good. I'm not saying there aren't excesses or that there aren't catastrophes - but a gastronomic tour of the United States is not the joke we make out it might be. The recipes that follow are a scant introduction to the best of culinary Americana, from the simplest to the alluringly kitsch.</p> <p><b>New England boiled dinner</b> <br>We feel a bollito misto is chic, so why not the Bostonian version? You do, traditionally, need salt beef for it, but that shouldn't be beyond a proper butcher. Just ask. I'm not suggesting you salt and spice it yourself. Or use ordinary beef. The Scottish mail-order butcher, Donald Russell (01467 629 666), does a very good Germanic cut called tafelspitz which works well. This recipe comes by way of Evan Jones's great book, American Food: the Gastronomic Story, first published in New York in 1974. Serves 4.</p> <p>1.5 kilos salt beef <br>6 turns of the mill of freshly ground pepper <br>1 bay leaf <br>1 parsnip <br>\u00bd a swede <br>3 large carrots <br>4 medium potatoes <br>\u00bd a cabbage <br>6 small beetroots, pre-boiled and peeled <br>3 tbsps horseradish sauce <br>6 tbsps sour cream <br>4 or 5 dashes of Tabasco</p> <p>Cover the salt beef with water, add the pepper and bay leaf and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer for a total of 4 hours. (If you're using ordinary brisket or the Tafelspitz, I'd halve this time.) Before the last 40 minutes, add the parsnip, swede, carrots and potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks. Before the last 15 minutes, add the cabbage, roughly chopped, and before the last 5 minutes, the beetroots.</p> <p>Remove the beef and slice thinly. Arrange it on a large heated plate and then fish out the vegetables with a slotted spoon and dot around the meat. Make a sauce to eat with it by mixing together the horseradish, sour cream and Tabasco in a small bowl.</p> <p>This makes enough for four with, as Evan Jones remarks, enough left over to make a red flannel hash. To make this, fry some chopped-up bacon and onion in a frying pan, then add the left-over beef, also chopped, along with diced boiled potato and beetroot. Cook it until you have a piping-hot, rubbly red cake - and eat with the corn breads below.</p> <p><b>Corn bread</b> <br>Since corn is the indigenous American ingredient, I couldn't help but include a recipe using it here. You can make corn bread in loaf, square or muffin tins, but I love the corn bread that comes in cornsticks, made in moulds that resemble folk art themselves, fashioned out of cast iron to give the nubbly form of corn in the cob. You can buy these sorts of moulds, though not usually in cast iron, over here now, but I've got some a friend devotedly schlepped over for me all the way from the Broadway Panhandler in New York, which I understandably cherish.</p> <p>Get some if you can, especially if you've got children, to whom (though not exclusively) they appeal. And eat these golden miniature maize breads with soup, stews, the hash above or just as they are, even for breakfast (add an extra teaspoon of baking powder if you are making muffins). Makes 18 cornsticks, 12 muffins or one batch of corn bread.</p> <p>175g fine cornmeal (or polenta - same difference, really) <br>125g plain flour <br>45g sugar <br>1 fat pinch salt <br>1 tbsp baking powder <br>250ml milk <br>1 egg <br>45g melted, cooled, unsalted butter <br>vegetable shortening for greasing cornsticks</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00ba/gas mark 6, then grease the cornstick moulds with melted vegetable shortening. If you're not using the cornstick moulds, you should grease a 20cm square tin (5cm deep) or 12-bun muffin tin with butter (if you're not using paper cases).</p> <p>Mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. In a measuring jug, beat together the milk, egg and cooled, melted butter. Then pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring with a wooden spoon until just combined. Don't worry in the slightest about the odd lump. Pour into the greased moulds and bake for</p> <p>12-15 minutes for the cornsticks, or 20-25 minutes for the square or muffin tins. When ready, the corn bread should be just pulling away from the sides. Cut the square into smaller squares or tip out the cornsticks or muffins and eat warm. The cornsticks, swabbed with butter, are God's way of telling you that greed is good.</p> <p><b>S'mores</b> <br>The original s'more - if the term can be accurately used for a vernacular foodstuff such as this - was a toasted marshmallow sandwiched between Graham crackers (digestive biscuits) and dunked into melted chocolate: campfire food, and so named because you eat one, you gotta eat s'more. Variations have developed to accommodate less impromptu modes of cooking and the one that follows is really a batch of brownies with a sandy covering of crumbled digestives under a topping of grilled mini-marshmallows. The name is well earned: this is the sort of food that you airily declare disgusting after the first, but then find, unaccountably, you've eaten half the tin.</p> <p>250g good-quality dark chocolate <br>75g unsalted butter <br>100g plain flour <br>\u00ba tsp baking powder <br>50g caster sugar <br>2 large eggs <br>4 tbsps golden syrup <br>75g digestives, razed to crumbs in the processor <br>125g mini-marshmallows</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160\u00ba/gas mark 3, and line a 22cm square brownie tin with baking parchment. Melt the chocolate and butter together; I find the easiest way is to give them 2 or so minutes on medium in the microwave. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and sugar, and beat in the eggs and then the golden syrup, followed by the melted chocolate and butter mixture.</p> <p>Pour or scrape into the prepared tin. Scatter the crumbled biscuits on top and cook for 35 minutes.</p> <p>Remove from the oven, switch on the grill and cover the baked mixture with the mini-marshmallows. Toast under the grill for the merest minute - watching over it all the time - until it's toasted. Leave for 20 minutes, then cut into large or small squares, as you like, with a wet knife. And then pretend you've made them for your children.</p> <p>\u0095 Nigella Lawson is cookery writer for Vogue; Nigel Slater returns next week</p>",

And just as we get annoyed when foreigners think our cooking is on the watery-stew and soggy-crumble level, so Americans must get incensed at our unworried assumption that their native fare extends little beyond hamburger and chiffon pies. I've eaten better in America, admittedly in the cities, than anywhere else in the world. You know that modern British Italianate thing - I first came by it in San Francisco and then New York more than 10 years ago. And it's not surprising that America is so interesting as an eating place. There is something inevitably gastronomically rewarding about a country that bases its identity on the cultural melting pot. This is the land of fusion cooking avant la lettre. I don't mean to preach, not least because my weakness here is not for the modern, evolved and savvy food hot off the transatlantic menu, but for a certain sort of down-home cooking, best described as culinary-kitsch Americana. Perhaps here is the place for me to make this public confession: yes, I do own a copy of a book called Mazeltov Y'all: the Heritage of Southern Jewish Cooking. And there are many more with titles not so dissimilar on my bookshelves. Food That Really Schmecks - a Mennonite cookbook - is another of my favourites. And I'm not making fun here: I like these books because they are driven by a passionate, territorial culinary pride. You can't read them without wanting to cook their food. And what many different American culinary cultures seem to share, apart from the obsessive need to chronicle, is an understanding of excellent simplicity: Maine lobsters, Florida stone crabs, New Orleans pompano - no one believes it has to be messed around with to be good. I'm not saying there aren't excesses or that there aren't catastrophes - but a gastronomic tour of the United States is not the joke we make out it might be. The recipes that follow are a scant introduction to the best of culinary Americana, from the simplest to the alluringly kitsch. New England boiled dinner We feel a bollito misto is chic, so why not the Bostonian version? You do, traditionally, need salt beef for it, but that shouldn't be beyond a proper butcher. Just ask. I'm not suggesting you salt and spice it yourself. Or use ordinary beef. The Scottish mail-order butcher, Donald Russell (01467 629 666), does a very good Germanic cut called tafelspitz which works well. This recipe comes by way of Evan Jones's great book, American Food: the Gastronomic Story, first published in New York in 1974. Serves 4. 1.5 kilos salt beef 6 turns of the mill of freshly ground pepper 1 bay leaf 1 parsnip \u00bd a swede 3 large carrots 4 medium potatoes \u00bd a cabbage 6 small beetroots, pre-boiled and peeled 3 tbsps horseradish sauce 6 tbsps sour cream 4 or 5 dashes of Tabasco Cover the salt beef with water, add the pepper and bay leaf and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer for a total of 4 hours. (If you're using ordinary brisket or the Tafelspitz, I'd halve this time.) Before the last 40 minutes, add the parsnip, swede, carrots and potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks. Before the last 15 minutes, add the cabbage, roughly chopped, and before the last 5 minutes, the beetroots. Remove the beef and slice thinly. Arrange it on a large heated plate and then fish out the vegetables with a slotted spoon and dot around the meat. Make a sauce to eat with it by mixing together the horseradish, sour cream and Tabasco in a small bowl. This makes enough for four with, as Evan Jones remarks, enough left over to make a red flannel hash. To make this, fry some chopped-up bacon and onion in a frying pan, then add the left-over beef, also chopped, along with diced boiled potato and beetroot. Cook it until you have a piping-hot, rubbly red cake - and eat with the corn breads below. Corn bread Since corn is the indigenous American ingredient, I couldn't help but include a recipe using it here. You can make corn bread in loaf, square or muffin tins, but I love the corn bread that comes in cornsticks, made in moulds that resemble folk art themselves, fashioned out of cast iron to give the nubbly form of corn in the cob. You can buy these sorts of moulds, though not usually in cast iron, over here now, but I've got some a friend devotedly schlepped over for me all the way from the Broadway Panhandler in New York, which I understandably cherish. Get some if you can, especially if you've got children, to whom (though not exclusively) they appeal. And eat these golden miniature maize breads with soup, stews, the hash above or just as they are, even for breakfast (add an extra teaspoon of baking powder if you are making muffins). Makes 18 cornsticks, 12 muffins or one batch of corn bread. 175g fine cornmeal (or polenta - same difference, really) 125g plain flour 45g sugar 1 fat pinch salt 1 tbsp baking powder 250ml milk 1 egg 45g melted, cooled, unsalted butter vegetable shortening for greasing cornsticks Preheat the oven to 200\u00ba/gas mark 6, then grease the cornstick moulds with melted vegetable shortening. If you're not using the cornstick moulds, you should grease a 20cm square tin (5cm deep) or 12-bun muffin tin with butter (if you're not using paper cases). Mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. In a measuring jug, beat together the milk, egg and cooled, melted butter. Then pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring with a wooden spoon until just combined. Don't worry in the slightest about the odd lump. Pour into the greased moulds and bake for 12-15 minutes for the cornsticks, or 20-25 minutes for the square or muffin tins. When ready, the corn bread should be just pulling away from the sides. Cut the square into smaller squares or tip out the cornsticks or muffins and eat warm. The cornsticks, swabbed with butter, are God's way of telling you that greed is good. S'mores The original s'more - if the term can be accurately used for a vernacular foodstuff such as this - was a toasted marshmallow sandwiched between Graham crackers (digestive biscuits) and dunked into melted chocolate: campfire food, and so named because you eat one, you gotta eat s'more. Variations have developed to accommodate less impromptu modes of cooking and the one that follows is really a batch of brownies with a sandy covering of crumbled digestives under a topping of grilled mini-marshmallows. The name is well earned: this is the sort of food that you airily declare disgusting after the first, but then find, unaccountably, you've eaten half the tin. 250g good-quality dark chocolate 75g unsalted butter 100g plain flour \u00ba tsp baking powder 50g caster sugar 2 large eggs 4 tbsps golden syrup 75g digestives, razed to crumbs in the processor 125g mini-marshmallows Preheat the oven to 160\u00ba/gas mark 3, and line a 22cm square brownie tin with baking parchment. Melt the chocolate and butter together; I find the easiest way is to give them 2 or so minutes on medium in the microwave. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and sugar, and beat in the eggs and then the golden syrup, followed by the melted chocolate and butter mixture. Pour or scrape into the prepared tin. Scatter the crumbled biscuits on top and cook for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, switch on the grill and cover the baked mixture with the mini-marshmallows. Toast under the grill for the merest minute - watching over it all the time - until it's toasted. Leave for 20 minutes, then cut into large or small squares, as you like, with a wet knife. And then pretend you've made them for your children. \u0095 Nigella Lawson is cookery writer for Vogue; Nigel Slater returns next week",

      "bodyText": "Comfort for those who worry about men. After years of reading that males lag behind females in just about everything but earning power, we learn today that an Oxford psychiatrist claims to have located the origins of speech in the Y-chromosome. In other words, men spoke first. Women may dismiss this as trivially true, pointing out that the finding merely underlines a well-established social truth, that nothing can be considered said until said by a man. But Professor Tim Crow is claiming rather more. He believes the transition from grunting to language was first made by the male of the species and that the reason for his clever noises was that they conferred sexual advantage. Coincidentally, last week another psychiatrist claimed to have discovered that men find women with a richer vocabulary more sexually appealing. This is so counter-intuitive as to leave us wondering whether something went awry with the research. Still, the two taken together generate interesting speculation about that Original Conversation. Clearly not: 'There's a bison down by the lake', still less: 'Don't eat the apple, Eve.' More a case of: 'Look at the phonemes on her.'",

These finds intensified a police search for surviving members of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God who may know what happened. The graves containing the slashed and strangled bodies - including those of 59 children - were discovered in a building used as a transit camp by the group of former Roman Catholics in Rukingeri District, in the West of the country. The fresh discoveries were made one week after at least 330 members of the cult burnt to death in a fire at their headquarters at Kanungu, 30 miles from the transit camp. The sect members were initially thought to have entered the church on 17 March, doused themselves in petrol and set themselves alight. They were reported to have believed that the Virgin Mary was coming to take them to heaven. Police say they are now treating the deaths as murder and not mass suicide. Shocked Ugandans are struggling to make sense of the killings, particularly as the sect was barely known before it so dramatically seized the headlines. The cult was founded in the late Eighties by a former Roman Catholic teacher and opposition politician, Joseph Kibwetere. He claimed to have regular visions of Jesus and Mary. Kibwetere built a following and gained credibility when a learned Catholic churchman, Father Dominic Katarabaabo, joined. In 1993, the group registered as an non-governmental organisation, a status given to charities, and set up a community near Kanungu on 10 acres of land donated by one of its principal 'prophets', Credonia Mwerinde. By the late Nineties, the community was thriving, growing bananas, pineapples and sugar cane. Members lived in dormitores, ate together and sent their children to the sect's own school.

At the beginning of March, Credonia Mwerinda told Kyomakama that the Virgin Mary was coming to take the cult members to heaven. Another sect leader, Father Dominic, also turned up in Kampala saying Mary was on her way.

The following morning they gathered in the sect's old church - known as their 'ark' - to find the doors and windows boarded up.

The initial suspicion of mass suicide altered when officers found six bodies, burnt with battery acid in a latrine inside a building used by the sect leaders. The discovery of mass graves at the transit camp last Friday further reinforced the view that the members had been murdered, perhaps as part of a ritual or because of a dispute with their leaders. In the week after the fire, police became increasingly convinced that the sect leaders could be alive, but Father Katarabaabo's charred body was found by the church entrance, his dog-collar seared into his flesh. Mwerinda and Kibwetere were seen leaving Kanungu on the day of the fire. Ugandans are struggling to understand how the sect survived for so long without the the police shutting it. Two others were banned last year. President Yoweri Museveni, who has ordered an inquiry into the killings, blames the country's poverty and rampant Aids epidemic.

Litigation, accusations of racism, exploitation, obscenity, cultural colonialism, deceit and mockery of the afflicted have all been placed at his gilded little feet over the past few days. Poor Oscar. </p> <p>Any awards ceremony thri-ves on controversy and, over the years, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science has had its share: from George C. Scott's refusal to accept the award for his role in Patton in 1971, to the refusal by members of the audience to stand for the award to veteran director Elia Kazan at last year's ceremony because he had given evidence to the House Un-American Activities Committee about alleged Communists. </p> <p>But the controversies this year seem almost to deserve their own list of nominations. Leading the attack has been the Wall Street Journal . On Friday, it published an 'exit poll' of academy members in a bid to pre-empt the ceremony and spoil the fun on awards night. </p> <p>This upset the academy, but what will cut deeper were mocking accusations in the paper the previous day suggesting its claims for the cultural significance of the event were a patronising conceit. The academy voters, wrote Edward Jay Epstein, believe 'their choices will, like Archimedes's lever, somehow influence the universe of entertainment'. </p> <p>Epstein quoted this year's co-producer of the show as saying 800 million people would be watching around the globe. But there were only 78 million people watching in the US last year which means that 'some 722 million foreigners, many without television sets, would have to stay up through the wee hours of the morning and the next working day to watch a show in a foreign language - an extraordinary conceit.' </p> <p>This year three of the films with chances of winning Oscars are based on true stories. All three will arrive at the Shrine auditorium trailing writs or attacks on their credibility. The latest writ was issued last week by Lucretia Nimocks, the wife of Jeffrey Wigand, on whose true story as a tobacco industry whistleblower The Insider , nominated as best film, was based. Russell Crowe, who plays Wigand, is a nominee for best actor. </p> <p>Nimocks claims she has been falsely portrayed as an unsupportive wife who quit when the going got tough. </p> <p> Boys Don't Cry , whose star Hilary Swank is co-favourite with Annette Bening for the best actress award, was the subject of a similar writ which has been settled just before the ceremony. Lara Tisdel, played by Chloe Sevingy (nominated as best supporting actress), had sued the producers for what she claimed was a damaging portrayal of her as someone who had failed to prevent a murder. She has settled for an undislosed sum. </p> <p> The Hurricane, based on the true story of boxer Rubin Carter, is the subject of angry websites and newspaper articles that accuse the filmmakers of distorting the facts. </p> <p>The controversy that received most publicity was the theft of the 55 Oscar statuettes and their subsequent discovery in LA's Koreatown by salvage worker Willie Fulgear. He has since been given the $50,000 reward offered by the transport firm responsible for delivering them and has been invited to the ceremony. Fulgear is black, which prompted Karen Grigsby Bates in the Los Angeles Times to refer to a joke about his find: 'That's about the only way a brother's gonna get an Oscar in Hollywood.' In the Oscars' history there have been but five black winners, since Hattie McDaniel won a best supporting role as Scarlett O'Hara's slave in Gone With The Wind . Sidney Poitier won one in 1963 for best actor in Lilies of the Field ; Louis Gossett Jr won as best supporting actor in 1982 for An Officer and a Gentleman ; Denzel Washington was best supporting actor for Glory in 1989; Whoopi Goldberg best supporting actress for Ghost in 1990; and Cuba Gooding Jnr best supporting actor for Jerry Maguire in 1996. </p> <p>By failing to invite Fulgear immediately, wrote Bates, the academy had failed to show class. 'Class, like Oscars for black actors, seems to be in short supply,' she said. Whether this influenced the academy voters in deciding whether Denzel Washington takes a best actor prize for The Hurricane or Michael Clarke Duncan wins supporting actor for The Green Mile , we shall know tonight. </p> <p>The academy says it would have invited Fulgear right away but was asked to wait until the police had completed investigations: one of the transport firm's drivers has now been charged with grand theft. </p> <p>The academy also faces a free speech dilemma. 'Blame Canada', a song from the cartoon South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, is nominated in the best song category. This seems to be the first time that a song containing the words 'fuck,' 'fart' and 'bitch' has been nominated. Robin Williams has been asked to sing it in a medley of the nominated songs. </p> <p> American Beauty, directed by British director Sam Mendes, is expected to carry off a bundle of awards. </p> <p>So will the little guy survive? Consider two figures. In 1999, the show pulled in more than $40 million in broadcast rights and a similar figure is anticipated this year. And this year a 30-second commercial during the show costs $1.5m. So will he survive? You will, Oscar, you will.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The bullet that killed Patrick Dorismond in midtown Manhattan had big-time politics written all over it as soon as it left the barrel of Detective Tony Vasquez's gun. It was the loudest shot in America for a long time, and it will echo well beyond Dorismond's funeral mass, which took place yesterday.</p> <p>The bullet shot another hole through the reputation of a New York Police Department that appears out of control; it was fired only days after the Bronx narrowly escaped full-scale rioting when four officers were acquitted of murdering West African street vendor Amadou Diallo.</p> <p>That bullet also cut Dorismond's wounded Haitian community in New York, only just recovering from the string of trials that followed the torture and sodomy by broomstick of another of their own - Abner Louima.</p> <p>That bullet then ripped into what is fast becoming the nastiest election campaign in living memory, between New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Clinton. And finally, it ricocheted into the climax of an epic gun control saga, its volley heard across the nation.</p> <p>Giuliani opted to inflame the already febrile resentment of New York's black community by smearing the character of the dead man and refusing to visit his bereaved family, lest such a call give the impression that the killing, which happened during an undercover drugs operation, was 'unjustified'.</p> <p>The mayor instead authorised the release - now itself a matter of legal contention - of Dorismond's police record to reveal a background of trouble. He was, as Giuliani said, 'no altar boy'. But Giuliani exaggerated, claiming 'possession of a gun' and 'robbery' in Dorismond's past.</p> <p>It was not a pretty story: a couple of disorderly conduct charges in 1993 and 1996 and a 'buy-and-bust' arrest for marijuana possession and more seriously, a complaint from his girlfriend filed last March, saying that Dorismond had beaten her while she held their one-year-old daughter.</p> <p>But no guns or robbery. And there were skeletons in Detective Vasquez's closet. His wife too, had filed a complaint of domestic abuse, and there had been numerous incidents over the past four years when Vasquez pulled his gun for no reason. In 1997, he was arrested for quick-drawing his weapon to break up a fight in Philadelphia. The following year, he shot a neighbour's dog.</p> <p>Accounts of Dorismond's background depict a street-wise, serious lad who lived hard and worked hard as a security officer to provide for his children - one called Infinity by ex-girlfriend Dwana Sobers and one-year-old Destiny by the woman he intended to marry, Karen Sturkey. The women insist that their lover 'didn't deserve to die'. One neighbour described him to The Observer as 'just a very quiet guy, a very nice man'.</p> <p>Mayor Giuliani's brazen demonisation of the victim sharpened the already-jagged Senate election battle with Clinton.</p> <p>For her, the shooting provided a welcome chance to take the offensive after the two candidates turned the St Patrick's Day parade into political theatre - Clinton coming off the worst, jeered by crowds as a 'Carpetbagger'. Now, she chose a raucous rally at Harlem town hall to accuse her opponent of 'writing off' a community, and of 'dividing the city'.</p> <p>She was inevitably joined by the self-appointed leader of New York's black community, Al Sharpton, who now adds the killing to his collection of just causes and who has organised witnesses to the shooting to come forward and testify to Dorismond's innocence in the incident.</p> <p>This Giuliani can take. But after the Dorismond killing, even some of the Mayor's own Republican team are baffled and dismayed by his reaction to the latest NYPD outrage. 'I don't think she can beat him,' said Giuliani's former aide and one-time chairman of the Republican National Committee, 'but he can beat himself.'</p> <p>New York's Republican governor George Pataki has publicly said he is 'perplexed' by the mayor's attitude.</p> <p>Behind the scenes at a fragmented City Hall - The Observer has learnt - the mayor has come under bitter attack from senior officials. Officials in his own Cabinet worry privately that Giuliani's response will 'finally rupture' - as one put it - a trust between City Hall and the black community only built by the fall in crime rates.</p> <p>Giuliani's own City Comptroller Alan Hevesi said the mayor's actions were 'very wrong'. Hevesi himself made a swift visit of condolence to the dead man's mother, Marie Dorismond, by way of sharp contrast to his boss.

      "bodyText": "The bullet that killed Patrick Dorismond in midtown Manhattan had big-time politics written all over it as soon as it left the barrel of Detective Tony Vasquez's gun. It was the loudest shot in America for a long time, and it will echo well beyond Dorismond's funeral mass, which took place yesterday. The bullet shot another hole through the reputation of a New York Police Department that appears out of control; it was fired only days after the Bronx narrowly escaped full-scale rioting when four officers were acquitted of murdering West African street vendor Amadou Diallo. That bullet also cut Dorismond's wounded Haitian community in New York, only just recovering from the string of trials that followed the torture and sodomy by broomstick of another of their own - Abner Louima. That bullet then ripped into what is fast becoming the nastiest election campaign in living memory, between New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Clinton. And finally, it ricocheted into the climax of an epic gun control saga, its volley heard across the nation. Giuliani opted to inflame the already febrile resentment of New York's black community by smearing the character of the dead man and refusing to visit his bereaved family, lest such a call give the impression that the killing, which happened during an undercover drugs operation, was 'unjustified'. The mayor instead authorised the release - now itself a matter of legal contention - of Dorismond's police record to reveal a background of trouble. He was, as Giuliani said, 'no altar boy'. But Giuliani exaggerated, claiming 'possession of a gun' and 'robbery' in Dorismond's past. It was not a pretty story: a couple of disorderly conduct charges in 1993 and 1996 and a 'buy-and-bust' arrest for marijuana possession and more seriously, a complaint from his girlfriend filed last March, saying that Dorismond had beaten her while she held their one-year-old daughter. But no guns or robbery. And there were skeletons in Detective Vasquez's closet. His wife too, had filed a complaint of domestic abuse, and there had been numerous incidents over the past four years when Vasquez pulled his gun for no reason. In 1997, he was arrested for quick-drawing his weapon to break up a fight in Philadelphia. The following year, he shot a neighbour's dog. Accounts of Dorismond's background depict a street-wise, serious lad who lived hard and worked hard as a security officer to provide for his children - one called Infinity by ex-girlfriend Dwana Sobers and one-year-old Destiny by the woman he intended to marry, Karen Sturkey. The women insist that their lover 'didn't deserve to die'. One neighbour described him to The Observer as 'just a very quiet guy, a very nice man'. Mayor Giuliani's brazen demonisation of the victim sharpened the already-jagged Senate election battle with Clinton. For her, the shooting provided a welcome chance to take the offensive after the two candidates turned the St Patrick's Day parade into political theatre - Clinton coming off the worst, jeered by crowds as a 'Carpetbagger'. Now, she chose a raucous rally at Harlem town hall to accuse her opponent of 'writing off' a community, and of 'dividing the city'. She was inevitably joined by the self-appointed leader of New York's black community, Al Sharpton, who now adds the killing to his collection of just causes and who has organised witnesses to the shooting to come forward and testify to Dorismond's innocence in the incident. This Giuliani can take. But after the Dorismond killing, even some of the Mayor's own Republican team are baffled and dismayed by his reaction to the latest NYPD outrage. 'I don't think she can beat him,' said Giuliani's former aide and one-time chairman of the Republican National Committee, 'but he can beat himself.' New York's Republican governor George Pataki has publicly said he is 'perplexed' by the mayor's attitude. Behind the scenes at a fragmented City Hall - The Observer has learnt - the mayor has come under bitter attack from senior officials. Officials in his own Cabinet worry privately that Giuliani's response will 'finally rupture' - as one put it - a trust between City Hall and the black community only built by the fall in crime rates. Giuliani's own City Comptroller Alan Hevesi said the mayor's actions were 'very wrong'. Hevesi himself made a swift visit of condolence to the dead man's mother, Marie Dorismond, by way of sharp contrast to his boss. The mayor is also under attack from so-called 'Giuliani Democrats' whose support he needs in the battle for the middle ground. But his aides insist 'there are still more votes to be won than lost in being tough on crime'. The war of words and bullets raging in New York dove tails into a second gunfight this week: between arms manufacturers and the Clinton administration, and within the arms industry. Glock, America's biggest domestic gunmaker and supplier of the guns fired by Vasquez, declared war by refusing to join British-owned Smith &amp; Wesson in its historic treaty with the US government. Faced with legal action by several states and cities, Smith &amp; Wesson agreed to restrictions on sale and distribution, plus child-proof safety locks on handguns. Glock, based in Georgia, rejected this, and the authority of the embryonic Oversight Commission, created to supervise such agreements. 'The commission is an absurd concept,' said Glock vice-president Paul Januzzo. Such defiance, with the apparent blessing of the formidable National Rifle Association, sets the scene for a mighty conflict in the courts. It could also cause political fallout: gun control is of extreme concern to women voters, deemed capable of deciding the forthcoming presidential election. George Bush is committed to only limited gun reforms, unlike his opponent Al Gore, who seems determined to push the Clinton administration's Smith &amp; Wesson breakthrough much further.",

      "body": "<p>The global launch next month of a new monster-like character for the Japanese Pokemon computer game will be one of the most hyped events of this new century. And, perhaps more significantly (or worryingly - for parents at least), it will offer another opportunity to witness a growing phenomenon: pester power.</p> <p>Ever since the Spice Girls shot to fame in the mid-Nineties pester power has been on the marketing agenda - but that, it seems, was an accident. 'We were expecting them to appeal to a teen audience,' says Robert Sandall of Virgin Records, who fought a fierce battle to sign the quintet in 1995. 'I'm not aware that anyone here was intending or expecting them to catch on with pre-teens. Once that started, we suddenly found ourselves in uncharted waters.'</p> <p>The public debate over child marketing began at that point. The standard liberal line was that the young girls who bought, or persuaded their parents to buy, records like 'Wannabe' were empowered by exposure to strong role models. Discomfort at the sound of five-year-olds singing lines like 'If you wanna be my lover' could be dismissed in the knowledge that they didn't understand what they were saying. Anxiety over the sight of six-year-olds stalking playgrounds in hot pants and halter tops could be assuaged by pointing out that little girls have always liked dressing up.</p> <p>Now every record company has an expanding roster of acts aimed at this newly discovered pre-teen market, with names like Aqua (makers of the infamous 'Barbie Girl') and Cartoons. Taken on their own, they are harmless and part of a forgotten line reaching back to the Monkees and Banana Splits. But as so often in this country, the Spice Girls unwittingly reflected changes that were far wider reaching. The under-10s, and increasingly the under-fives, have been thrust, blinking, into the economic limelight.</p> <p>They are significant players in the economy. Fashion houses, including Paul Smith, Armani, Calvin Klein and even Gucci have introduced lines designed for pre-teens, and next month's Pokemon launch will be one of the most hyped events of the new century. Already the associated playing cards have been banned from infants schools across Britain.</p> <p>Advertising and marketing of products ranging from food to holidays and cars is being aimed directly at pre-teens. Initially, all this looks to be linked to economic and demographic shifts. The baby boom generations of the Fifties and Sixties have been having children, and there are more of them. They are also having children later in life, and these older parents have more money to spend on their children.</p> <p>According to Wall's Monitor, which specialises in research into the five to 16 age group, there was a 38 per cent rise in pocket money between 1993 and 1998 - with 28 per cent of that rise from 1997 to 1998.In describing the ramifications of this increased affluence, Mark Ritson of the London Business School draws a distinction between customers and consumers. He uses the example of dog food to illustrate what he means. Dogs eat the food, but the marketing pitch is aimed at their owners.</p> <p>'The real key, the holy grail, is getting kids to pester parents to buy something for the whole family, like a holiday or car. In this sense, they can be a very powerful marketing tool and the trick is to split a message in two, with one part for adults and another for children,' he says.</p> <p>'The difficulty with small children is that their fashion cycle is even shorter than it has become for grown-ups, and thus much more difficult to follow and predict. The other thing is that the children's market is the most socially orientated of all, being almost entirely based on social networks.</p> <p>'Like flu, fashion spreads more quickly in schools. It can be hard to tap into, but when you do, the rewards are very great.'</p> <p>This explains why there are appalling shortages of one particular toy every Christmas (past examples are Buzz Lightyear dolls, Cabbage Patch dolls and beany babies), while other likely contenders gather dust on the shelves.</p> <p>According to Dr Alexandra Lamont of the Psychology Department at Leicester University small children can be sophisticated consumers of advertising, being able to understand 'complex ideas like false belief, and complex forms of pretence'. They are, in other words, easily instilled with an innate feel for advertising.</p> <p>All of which seemed perfectly innocent until, a few weeks ago, the august Journal of the American Medical Association produced a report which described a threefold rise in prescriptions of medical drugs for children under five, with toddlers being fed stimulants, anti-depressants and other substances in sharply increased number for perceived psychiatric problems.</p> <p>Included in the findings was the contention that between 1991 and 1995 doctors' prescriptions of stimulants (mainly Ritalin, for supposed Attention Deficit Disorder, previously known as hyperactivity) shot up from 4.1 per 1,000 pre-school children, to 12.3. The researchers expected the trend to have continued between 1995 and the present.</p> <p>Steven Hyman, director of the US National Institute for Mental Health, told the New York Times that he was 'more than shocked' by the findings. More disturbingly for us, five years ago there were only 2,000 prescriptions written for Ritalin in the UK. By 1997 doctors were writing 92,000 prescriptions.</p> <p>What has this got to do with Gucci bags for kids? In the music industry, pester pop, like boy bands and girl groups, is a response to a profound financial crisis. The acts who provide it are cheap to develop and run, and easy to replace once they've had a few hits.</p> <p>The same is true outside music. The one feature of our economy which Karl Marx and Gordon Brown agree on is that it needs to keep expanding and finding new markets in order to avoid stagnation and recession. Traditionally, new markets have been out there somewhere but now they're running out. So we've looked inward and found an untapped and constantly renewable supply of... kids.</p> <p>At a glance, all the attention we and the marketeers are paying them looks like respect, as though our children are finally being given their place at the consumer table. What we're actually doing is controlling them more rigorously than we have for three generations, turning them into little versions of ourselves.</p> <p>We give them Paul Smith jeans so they'll look l!ike us, Ritalin or Prozac when they don't behave like us. We load them up with homework so they'll feel like us.</p> <p>Pester power is not what it seems. Kids should be kids. It's what they do best.</p> <p><b>'At 10 I don't need a mobile, says Dad'</b></p> <p><b> Martin O'Dea, eight, from Holland Park, London</b></p> <p>For Christmas we got a digital TV so I can watch programmes on Cartoon Network and Sky One.

Ever since the Spice Girls shot to fame in the mid-Nineties pester power has been on the marketing agenda - but that, it seems, was an accident. 'We were expecting them to appeal to a teen audience,' says Robert Sandall of Virgin Records, who fought a fierce battle to sign the quintet in 1995. 'I'm not aware that anyone here was intending or expecting them to catch on with pre-teens. Once that started, we suddenly found ourselves in uncharted waters.' The public debate over child marketing began at that point. The standard liberal line was that the young girls who bought, or persuaded their parents to buy, records like 'Wannabe' were empowered by exposure to strong role models. Discomfort at the sound of five-year-olds singing lines like 'If you wanna be my lover' could be dismissed in the knowledge that they didn't understand what they were saying. Anxiety over the sight of six-year-olds stalking playgrounds in hot pants and halter tops could be assuaged by pointing out that little girls have always liked dressing up. Now every record company has an expanding roster of acts aimed at this newly discovered pre-teen market, with names like Aqua (makers of the infamous 'Barbie Girl') and Cartoons. Taken on their own, they are harmless and part of a forgotten line reaching back to the Monkees and Banana Splits. But as so often in this country, the Spice Girls unwittingly reflected changes that were far wider reaching. The under-10s, and increasingly the under-fives, have been thrust, blinking, into the economic limelight. They are significant players in the economy. Fashion houses, including Paul Smith, Armani, Calvin Klein and even Gucci have introduced lines designed for pre-teens, and next month's Pokemon launch will be one of the most hyped events of the new century. Already the associated playing cards have been banned from infants schools across Britain. Advertising and marketing of products ranging from food to holidays and cars is being aimed directly at pre-teens. Initially, all this looks to be linked to economic and demographic shifts. The baby boom generations of the Fifties and Sixties have been having children, and there are more of them. They are also having children later in life, and these older parents have more money to spend on their children. According to Wall's Monitor, which specialises in research into the five to 16 age group, there was a 38 per cent rise in pocket money between 1993 and 1998 - with 28 per cent of that rise from 1997 to 1998.In describing the ramifications of this increased affluence, Mark Ritson of the London Business School draws a distinction between customers and consumers. He uses the example of dog food to illustrate what he means. Dogs eat the food, but the marketing pitch is aimed at their owners. 'The real key, the holy grail, is getting kids to pester parents to buy something for the whole family, like a holiday or car. In this sense, they can be a very powerful marketing tool and the trick is to split a message in two, with one part for adults and another for children,' he says. 'The difficulty with small children is that their fashion cycle is even shorter than it has become for grown-ups, and thus much more difficult to follow and predict. The other thing is that the children's market is the most socially orientated of all, being almost entirely based on social networks. 'Like flu, fashion spreads more quickly in schools. It can be hard to tap into, but when you do, the rewards are very great.' This explains why there are appalling shortages of one particular toy every Christmas (past examples are Buzz Lightyear dolls, Cabbage Patch dolls and beany babies), while other likely contenders gather dust on the shelves. According to Dr Alexandra Lamont of the Psychology Department at Leicester University small children can be sophisticated consumers of advertising, being able to understand 'complex ideas like false belief, and complex forms of pretence'. They are, in other words, easily instilled with an innate feel for advertising. All of which seemed perfectly innocent until, a few weeks ago, the august Journal of the American Medical Association produced a report which described a threefold rise in prescriptions of medical drugs for children under five, with toddlers being fed stimulants, anti-depressants and other substances in sharply increased number for perceived psychiatric problems. Included in the findings was the contention that between 1991 and 1995 doctors' prescriptions of stimulants (mainly Ritalin, for supposed Attention Deficit Disorder, previously known as hyperactivity) shot up from 4.1 per 1,000 pre-school children, to 12.3. The researchers expected the trend to have continued between 1995 and the present. Steven Hyman, director of the US National Institute for Mental Health, told the New York Times that he was 'more than shocked' by the findings. More disturbingly for us, five years ago there were only 2,000 prescriptions written for Ritalin in the UK. By 1997 doctors were writing 92,000 prescriptions. What has this got to do with Gucci bags for kids? In the music industry, pester pop, like boy bands and girl groups, is a response to a profound financial crisis. The acts who provide it are cheap to develop and run, and easy to replace once they've had a few hits. The same is true outside music. The one feature of our economy which Karl Marx and Gordon Brown agree on is that it needs to keep expanding and finding new markets in order to avoid stagnation and recession. Traditionally, new markets have been out there somewhere but now they're running out. So we've looked inward and found an untapped and constantly renewable supply of... kids. At a glance, all the attention we and the marketeers are paying them looks like respect, as though our children are finally being given their place at the consumer table. What we're actually doing is controlling them more rigorously than we have for three generations, turning them into little versions of ourselves. We give them Paul Smith jeans so they'll look l!ike us, Ritalin or Prozac when they don't behave like us. We load them up with homework so they'll feel like us. Pester power is not what it seems. Kids should be kids. It's what they do best. 'At 10 I don't need a mobile, says Dad' Martin O'Dea, eight, from Holland Park, London For Christmas we got a digital TV so I can watch programmes on Cartoon Network and Sky One. My favourite is Pok\u00e9mon. I would like Windows 2000 because it's the latest system and MagicArtist which I hope to get in America. I prefer to play with games on consoles rather than on a computer because they are easier to control. I have Sega Megadrive, Sega Master Drive and Super Nintendo and lots of games for them. They all came from car boot sales because children sell their old stuff that they don't want any more. I have 173 Pok\u00e9mon cards but a lot of them are doubles. I would like a Sega Dreamcast but my parents say it's too expensive. I am going to Florida next month with my family. I think I will be able to buy some of the things I want in America. Maija Marsh, 10, from Finsbury Park, London Everyone used to want yo-yos and Tamagotchis. Now it's Pok\u00e9mon cards and Gameboy colours. The things I pester my parents for are: a new bike, books, chocolate, smoked salmon, clothes and a mobile phone. I think asking for most of these things is reasonable but asking for some, like more books when my shelf is about to crack through the middle, is a bit silly. Dad says I'll get the bike when I leave primary school, there's no need for a mobile phone, new books are always arriving in the house, modelling clay will be bought when I have caught up on my writing and painting and we'll get more chocolate tonight when we do the shopping!

      "body": "<p>Society in San Francisco was aghast to discover last year that one of its leading lights, Gordon Getty, son of the oil magnate J Paul Getty, had been secretly keeping a second family for many years. </p> <p>The younger Getty had three daughters by his mistress, Cynthia Beck, who took him to court to change their name to his, and claim a share of the family fortune. </p> <p>As one of the richest men in the world Gordon Getty was able to view this with a degree of equanimity. For most people , having a second family can be laden with financial implications that will radically affect their lifestyles for years to come. </p> <p>More than 50 per cent of parents who become divorced or separated find a new partner within five years, in many cases marrying for a second time. As a result, thousands of second families are created each year, as mothers and fathers with one set of financial dependents add another set to their responsibilities, either by starting a new family or by becoming a step-parent. </p> <p>The permutations are endless: fathers supporting their natural children who don't live with them, and their step-children who do, for example, or fathers supporting their own children from a second relationship, and those from a first who don't. And, of course, there are mothers in all of these situations - they may be far less common, but there are 50,000 women who have been assessed by the Child Support Agency over maintenance for their children. </p> <p>Whatever the precise scenario, the decision to embark on a second family involves a huge financial commitment, even if it is one that is not always consciously acknowledged. </p> <p>The implications are not just whether you have enough to take on a second family, in terms of the income you will need to earn and the amount you will have left to spend. For the nature of broken relationships creates a potential minefield in which the division of resources between two - or even three - families can be extremely complicated to work out, and can lead to tensions between all the parties involved that may even put second marriages and relationships at risk. </p> <p>Cheryl Walters, head of policy and research at Parentline Plus, an organisation which incorporates the National Association of Stepfamilies, believes that many parents do not even consider the financial implications before starting a second family. 'There are people who just meet someone, feel absolutely right and decide to go for it,' she says. 'Others consider the pros and cons more seriously. What is clear is that those who do consider all the angles have a better outcome in the long-term.' </p> <p>For any putative second-family parent, affordability is clearly a key issue, if not the only one. According to Loughborough University's Centre for Research in Social Policy, the average child costs \u00a354,000 at today's prices to raise to the age of 17 - or \u00a33,200 each year. If you already had three children by your ex-partner, and you took on responsibility for a couple more, that would leave you with a dent of \u00a316,000 in your net income, an amount that somebody on an average income would find impossible to support. </p> <p>This assumes, of course, that the parent in question is supporting the children in their first family. In reality, of course, most don't. Liz Sewell, chief executive of the lone parent families' organisation Gingerbread, says: 'The single most important statistic is that only a third of lone-parent families receive any maintenance from the father. If you become a lone parent, your income will almost certainly fall, but if you become an absent parent, your income is quite likely to rise.' </p> <p>Up until now, many parents who don't have custody of their children - which usually means fathers - have been able to start a second family fairly confident that they can avoid supporting their first one. That may be about to change, with a new Child Support Act that promises much tougher sanctions to make parents pay. The amount they have to pay is clearly much more simply defined in the planned reform of the Child Support Agency. </p> <p>But statutory child maintenance is only one part of the financial liability you have to consider when you start a second family. For a start, if you have been married, you may have to pay spousal maintenance to your ex-wife (or, less commonly, your husband). As far as your children are concerned, you will inevitably be asked to stump up for extras, whether it is a pair of trainers, piano lessons or a school exchange trip. And you may find yourself having to contribute to two mortgages, two life insurance policies and even two pensions, either as part of a divorce settlement or to provide the security that you want for your children. Inevitably, in some cases, that means deciding not to have any more children, or limiting the size of a second family. </p> <p>Ian MacKay, a spokesman for Families Need Fathers, says: 'It is certainly true that absent fathers who keep in touch with their first family end up worse off than those who have less contact. A father who walks away and merely meets his CSA liability spares himself the cost of looking after his children when he has access, and also the cost of travel. For example, one chap I've been helping is in the RAF. His ex-wife is in Scotland, but he's been posted to Wiltshire, and it's obviously expensive for him to go and see his children there. But the judge has told him that the important thing is for him to maintain his children, not for him to see them.' </p> <p>Absent parents who try to keep up the best relationship with their 'first family' children, in addition to supporting them, must certainly be prepared for the fact that it will cost them. In cases where one parent has custody, and the other only has contact, if the 'absent' parent looks after the children for less than 104 nights a year - equivalent to two nights every week - there is no reduction in the maintenance that many are liable to pay. </p> <p>Equally, if they look after the children full-time for any period, say half the summer holidays, they are unlikely to receive any of the Child Benefit that is paid to the parent with custody. And the one tax concession towards supporting a second family - income tax relief on maintenance payments worth around \u00a34 a week for standard rate taxpayers - is being abolished from April. </p> <p>Resolving financial issues with your ex-partner is going to be stressful in many cases, especially if the parting was somewhat acrimonious. </p> <p>Sewell says: 'Money becomes used as a bargaining tool.' In spite of her earnest wish that parents should not use funding for children to push other issues, Sewell acknowledges that maintenance is frequently used as a lever for the absent parent to obtain access. </p> <p>But financial issues can also take a toll on the second family. It may be resentment at maintenance payments made to the first family, or something as simple as a father buying more expensive presents for his first set of children when they come to stay. If both partners in the second family have children of their own, the tensions and resentments can become even more inflamed. </p> <p>Parentline Plus' Walters says: 'If things don't get talked about, you can end up with each parent fighting for their own. But although these issues are messy, if you can bear to tackle them at the outset, then it doesn't have to become a war. With the new couple it's absolutely vital to face up to these issues.' </p> <p>Too often, Walters says, money becomes the repository for many of the disputes that surface around a second family. Anyone embarking on such a course must be prepared to separate the financial matters from the underlying issues, and to discuss both in an adult fashion. </p> <p>Sorting out the finances to everyone's satisfaction may not assuage all the feelings of hurt and resentment that accompany divorce and separation, but it can provide the basis for a more civilised relationship between all the parties involved. </p> <p><strong>Supporting roles: The issues</strong></p> <p><strong> 1. Child maintenance</strong> </p> <p> Can you afford to support your existing children? Under the new CSA rules, which should come into force within the next two years, you will be expected to pay 15 per cent of your net income for one child, 20 per cent for two, and 25 per cent for three. It is possible to come to an agreement independent of the CSA in court. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Spousal maintenance</strong> </p> <p> If you weren't married to your ex-, you don't have to worry about this. Maintenance usually forms part of a divorce settlement, principally in cases where one partner has little or no earnings of their own, and has been dependent upon the other for a considerable period. But if the supported partner remarries or co-habits, the maintenance stops for good. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Access</strong> </p> <p> Unless joint custody is granted, you must depend on access to see your children. If they spend more than 104 nights a year under your roof, you may be entitled to a reduction in maintenance. Parents with custody therefore have a vested interest in keeping access to less than two nights a week. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Stepchildren</strong> </p> <p> Who is going to support your stepchildren? Under the law, their natural parents are jointly responsible for their upkeep, which means that won't earn you any reduction in the amount of maintenance you pay for your own children. However, if their other parent has left the country, or simply refuses to pay, it may be down to you and your new partner. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Mortgage</strong> </p> <p> Usually in the case of divorce, the house is sold and the proceeds shared, taking account of the division of other assets. In a minority of cases, though, a parent may find that their name remains on the mortgage, and they could find they have difficulty in obtaining a new mortgage. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Benefits</strong> </p> <p> Child-related benefits are all paid to the parent who has custody. So if you are the 'absent' parent, you're entitled to nothing, even if you frequently look after your children during access visits. </p> <p> <strong> 7. School/university fees</strong> </p> <p> A court can order you to pay school fees for the children from your first family, particularly if they had already started in private school when your relationship ended, or if it had been your agreed intention for them to have private schooling. Your liability may not end at 18 - your offspring could get a court order to make you contribute towards their upkeep at university. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Life insurance</strong> </p> <p> If you die, would all of your children be provided for? You may want to take out a life insurance policy for each set of children. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Pension</strong> </p> <p> Unless it is offset against other assets at the time of a divorce settlement, part of your pension may be earmarked for your former spouse, or it may be split so he or she receives part of the fund in their own right. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Inheritance</strong> </p> <p> If you have a second family, it is important to make a will so that your intentions are absolutely clear. Your step-children have no claim on your estate if you die intestate, unless they can prove they were dependent on you.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Phil and Jane are facing an all too familiar conundrum. Should they use their savings to pay off part of their mortgage or not? With low inflation and tax relief on mortgage interest payments about to disappear having a mortgage no longer holds much attraction. </p> <p>The couple bought their current home with a \u00a331,000 endowment mortgage in 1989. Rather than move again they increased their mortgage with the Halifax by \u00a312,000 to pay for a loft extension. </p> <p>They also switched their mortgage on to a two-year fixed rate which has just ended. When they took out the loan they were careful to ensure there was no extended lock-in after the end of the fixed-rate period so their options are now open again. </p> <p>Phil and Jane have Tessas of approximately \u00a314,000. They are strongly considering whether to use this money together with other savings to pay off \u00a315,000 of their mortgage and also whether to move their remaining loan from the Halifax to Egg to get a better mortgage rate. </p> <p>Phil still hankers after a larger property more like the one in Essex in which he grew up. However, Phil acknowledges that his parents were able to trade up because of inflation and rapidly rising house prices in the 1960s and Seventies. </p> <p>Nowadays that is not happening in the area where Phil and Jane lives. Their house, bought in the Eighties boom, is barely worth more than they paid for it and moving to a larger property would mean even higher outgoings. </p> <p>Phil's other area of concern is his Halifax and Norwich Union shares, worth around \u00a38,000, held in self-select Peps. Jane has been saving \u00a350 a month in a Fidelity Moneybuilder Pep/Isa and this is now worth around \u00a34,000. </p> <p>On the pensions front, Jane has been a member of the Local Government Pension Scheme throughout her working life. Phil has been a member of the teacher's scheme for the past 15 years. Twelve years ago he also started paying FSAVCs to Colonial Mutual but when he later considered increasing them and found out how expensive they were he decided to leave his savings at \u00a330 a month. </p> <p><strong>Vital statistics: PHIL AND JANE HARKER</strong></p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 39 and 41 </p> <p><strong> Live in: </strong> Preston </p> <p><strong> Occupation: </strong> Lecturer and probation officer </p> <p><strong> Earn: </strong> \u00a324,000 and \u00a323,000 </p> <p><strong> Mortgage: </strong> \u00a343,000 </p> <p><strong> Debts: </strong> None </p> <p><strong> Investments: </strong> \u00a36,500 in bank account; \u00a314,000 in Tessas, \u00a38,000 in self select Pep; \u00a34,000 in unit trust Pep/ISA </p> <p><strong> Pension: </strong> Members of occupational schemes </p> <p><strong> Aims: </strong> To find out whether it is a good idea to pay off part of their mortgage, remortgage and sell Halifax shares </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Martin Jones</strong></p> <p>It can make sense to use investments to repay debt where the return on the investments after tax is less than the cost of the interest on the debt.

If they are in a general Pep, the proceeds could be transferred to a unit trust Pep. If they are in a single company Pep (SCP) he will need either to sell or transfer to another single share SCP.

I would not dissuade them though from reducing their mortgage debt. I would first use the \u00a36,500 currently invested with the Halifax, as this is likely to be attracting only a modest rate of interest which is taxable. I would then use the interest from the Tessas and roll over the capital into a Tessa-only ISA. This would still leave Phil and Jane with safe tax-free funds available instantly. </p> <p>I would endorse remortgaging.

      "body": "<p>Should you hope to snap up one of the 2 million brand new homes due to be built on brownfield sites in the next 20 years, a slice of the ancient past could come as an unexpected extra. </p> <p>Most brown sites are in the centre of old towns and cities, and are more likely than greenfield plots to yield treasures. Brooches, Roman coins, and even a set of Georgian false teeth have been uncovered. </p> <p>Environment Minister John Prescott this week announced that more than 800,000 new homes would be built in the South East in the next five years. Recycled land will be used for at least 60 per cent of all new homes. </p> <p>Before housebuilders start digging out foundations on these old sites, archaeologists are brought in to check for historic remains. If they find signs of important settlements, major excavations will begin. Finds are being meticulously recorded on building sites all over the country. For example, mediaeval bottles, musket balls, and a thirteenth-century iron arrowhead have been found on the site of a development being built by Countryside Residential at Llangattock, near Crickhowell. Archaeologists think fairs and markets were held around the enclosed church. </p> <p>Channel 4's Time Team has prompted greater interest in archaeology, thanks partly to the programme's affable Phil Harding. He has just finished an exciting excavation of an important Saxon settlement at Bicester, near Oxford. This has uncovered eight Saxon buildings - and re-written local history. </p> <p>The site, soon to disappear under a modern retirement development, is in a former frontier zone between the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia. The dig exposed buildings and shards of pottery. Local guidebooks suggest Bicester was found by St Birinus in the eighth century, but the dig reveals it was founded around 410. </p> <p>\"This is a damned good site: it's textbook stuff,\" said Harding. \"St Birinus is said to have converted many to Christianity and may have visited the area.

      "bodyText": "Should you hope to snap up one of the 2 million brand new homes due to be built on brownfield sites in the next 20 years, a slice of the ancient past could come as an unexpected extra. Most brown sites are in the centre of old towns and cities, and are more likely than greenfield plots to yield treasures. Brooches, Roman coins, and even a set of Georgian false teeth have been uncovered. Environment Minister John Prescott this week announced that more than 800,000 new homes would be built in the South East in the next five years. Recycled land will be used for at least 60 per cent of all new homes. Before housebuilders start digging out foundations on these old sites, archaeologists are brought in to check for historic remains. If they find signs of important settlements, major excavations will begin. Finds are being meticulously recorded on building sites all over the country. For example, mediaeval bottles, musket balls, and a thirteenth-century iron arrowhead have been found on the site of a development being built by Countryside Residential at Llangattock, near Crickhowell. Archaeologists think fairs and markets were held around the enclosed church. Channel 4's Time Team has prompted greater interest in archaeology, thanks partly to the programme's affable Phil Harding. He has just finished an exciting excavation of an important Saxon settlement at Bicester, near Oxford. This has uncovered eight Saxon buildings - and re-written local history. The site, soon to disappear under a modern retirement development, is in a former frontier zone between the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia. The dig exposed buildings and shards of pottery. Local guidebooks suggest Bicester was found by St Birinus in the eighth century, but the dig reveals it was founded around 410. \"This is a damned good site: it's textbook stuff,\" said Harding. \"St Birinus is said to have converted many to Christianity and may have visited the area. The royal families of Mercia and Wessex wanted their children to marry to create an alliance, but the Christians refused to unite with pagans. So the pagans converted in a mass baptism in the Thames.\" Building has just started on the land, which will become a retirement development. Turning up signs of ancient life unexpectedly when a site is cleared is dreaded by many builders, as it can cause expensive delays. For example, plans by Alfred McAlpine Homes to build 47 new homes at The Paddocks in Thursby, Cumbria, were held up for about four weeks after the discovery of mediaeval pottery.

      "bodyText": "Unions fear that Goodyear's Wolverhampton tyre plant will close, killing 2,500 jobs and intensifying the Midlands manufacturing crisis. Staff at the plant, the town's largest employer, were put on short-time working last week. Goodyear blamed the strong pound and industry overcapacity, but refused to give trade unions any assurance of the factory's future. 'We're hitting a blank wall in terms of information,' said Jim Hunt, regional secretary of the Transport &amp; General Workers Union. 'There's a genuine fear of closure. To Wolverhampton, it's like closing Longbridge.' A shutdown would be another huge blow for the area's tyre industry. In January Sumitomo, the Japanese tyremaker now owned by Goodyear, cut 650 of the 1,700 jobs at its Dunlop factory in Birmingham. At the start of the year, Michelin announced 473 redundancies at its huge plant in Stoke-on-Trent, cutting the workforce to 2,300. Goodyear declined to comment this weekend.",

The company was virtually at the bottom of the league table of Britain's 'big six' beer producers. The company was saved from having to fend off a hostile takeover bid only by the intervention of the Monopolies Commission. In an industry dominated by big bruisers, it was seen as the weakling in the (Scottish) corner. </p> <p>Look at S&amp;N now. It is by far the biggest brewer in the UK. Of the six companies which dominated the industry at the end of the Eighties, it is the only group to have both remained in brewing and committed itself to doing so in the future. And S&amp;N's planned \u00a31.7 billion takeover of Kronenbourg of France, announced last week, will propel the Edinburgh-based company into the superleague of European brewing - putting it second only to the mighty Heineken of the Netherlands. </p> <p>The scale of change that has taken place in the British brewing industry over the past decade is breathtaking. Consider the upheavals that brewing has undergone: </p> <p>\u0095 Grand Metropolitan - now part of Diageo - handed its breweries over to Courage; </p> <p>\u0095 Allied Lyons, as it then was, pooled its breweries with those of Carlsberg and later pulled out of brewing altogether; </p> <p>\u0095 Scottish &amp; Newcastle - which in 1988 had been on the receiving end of a bid from Elders of Australia, owner of Courage - extracted the sweetest revenge in 1995 when it bought Courage from a then enfeebled Elders; </p> <p>\u0095 Whitbread admitted last year that brewing, the business on which the empire had been built for centuries, was no longer seen as a core part of the operation; </p> <p>\u0095 Bass, which was overtaken as the largest brewer in Britain only when Scottish bought Courage, said that it, too, was putting its beer business up for sale. </p> <p>The outcome of the auction of the Bass breweries could be complete within weeks. The City's favourite frontrunners are South African Breweries (SAB) and Heineken. (Heineken executives were in London last week trying to convince investors of their case.) But there are other contenders. Carlsberg should not be written off. </p> <p>Conventional wisdom has it that Carlsberg would find it hard to raise the \u00a31.5bn-plus necessary to secure a deal because the group is controlled by a charitable trust; the company cannot issue new equity to pay for an acquisition because to do so would dilute the trust's holding. But it is thought that Carlsberg is testing the idea that the trust could give up control without sacrificing influence: that might make a bid possible. Belgium's Interbrew is also thought still to be in the running. </p> <p>A further outsider is Kirin of Japan. Two years ago, the company employed advisers in London to look at the opportunities for investment in Europe. </p> <p>The auction of Whitbread's breweries will not start in earnest until a Bass sale has been tied up. Only when it is clear who has secured Bass Breweries will the contenders for Whitbread's assets be clear. </p> <p>Interbrew of Belgium will be interested in Whitbread's beer operation. Whitbread already produces Interbrew's Stella under licence in the UK. Whitbread's other big lager brand is Heineken. If Heineken fails to secure Bass, then the Dutch company may wish to take control of Whitbread. A further possibility is a buyout by management, led by Miles Templeman who runs the breweries. Whitbread's beer operation could fetch upwards of \u00a3300 million. </p> <p>For Whitbread Plc the outcome of the Bass sale is clearly of huge importance. If SAB triumphs - and the company is desperate to increase its European presence and thus reduce its dependence on earnings within South Africa - the strategic implications for Heineken and Interbrew are profound. </p> <p>Their brands clearly compete with one another. Whitbread, as brewer of both companies' products in Britain, has had to try to perform a delicate juggling act: to be promoting Heineken's products could be taken badly by Interbrew and vice versa. </p> <p>If neither Heineken nor Interbrew secures Bass's breweries, each will fight hard to ensure that the Whitbread operation does not end up in the hands of its rival. If, on the other hand, Bass does go to either of the continental rivals the winner would seek to extricate itself from its licensing deal with Whitbread which would have an effect on the latter's valuation. </p> <p>With both the Bass and Whitbread sales, there are complex problems to be addressed. The key issue is distribution. With the exception of Guinness, there is no substantial brewer in Britain that does not have a 'supply agreement' with a large pub operator - a long-term deal guaranteeing its ales and lagers a place on the bar. There is little point in buying a large beer producer if there are no pubs which are obliged to stock your products. Indeed, during the Nineties, the wholesale price of beer net of tax fell steadily as brewers competed ever more fiercely to persuade pub companies to sign supply deals. </p> <p>This means that the publicly-stated price for any Whitbread or Bass brewing sale could be way adrift from the figures that have been suggested. Breweries which have supply agreements giving them a market for their products - agreements guaranteeing high prices and large volumes over a long period - will be worth a great deal. With little or no guarantee of distribution, the breweries will be worth far less. It is thought that Britain's competition authorities would be willing to accept a supply agreement which obliged pubs to sell a particular brewer's beers for up to three years. </p> <p>Scottish &amp; Newcastle is clearly not in the running for any of the British brewing assets now on offer. The company's share of the UK market is at least 26 per cent. On some measures, it is nudging dangerously close to the 30 per cent mark at which a range of European competition rules kick in to force a brewer to give up exclusive distribution deals. </p> <p>The company can certainly expand further in the UK by buying more hotels, for example. But to become a larger player in brewing, it has been clear for some time that S&amp;N's only avenue has been to look overseas - hence the Kronenbourg deal. The pressure on the company's finances is being eased by the structure of the agreement with Kronenbourg's current owner, Danone. S&amp;N is paying 2.5 billion francs (about \u00a3230m) initially. Danone is also given warrants to buy 25 million S&amp;N shares. At a later stage, Danone will be able to demand a further FFr13 billion (\u00a31.2bn), giving S&amp;N full control. </p> <p>Also, S&amp;N has the prospect of bolstering its balance sheet further when it sells its Center Parcs and Pontins holidays division for an expected \u00a3950m. </p> <p>In any case, S&amp;N has emerged as a force to be reckoned with. Alick Rankin, who as patrician head of S&amp;N fought off Elders in 1988 and saw his company buy Courage in 1995, would have been proud. In the early Eighties, the company had just 7 per cent of the UK beer market. It will soon be the second largest brewer in Europe. Tragically, Rankin will not be around to see the climax of this transformation. He died of leukaemia last autumn.</p>",

At the heart of the conflict is a battle over media rights and an ambitious plan to bring bookmaking into Britain's front rooms. The behind the scenes machinations involving the courses and the broadcasters make the skulduggery of a Dick Francis novel look decidely tame. </p> <p>The 12 biggest racecourses are currently in an exclusive period of negotiation with a media consortium spearheaded by Channel 4 and which also includes the BBC and cable operator NTL. The 47 other racecourses are terrified of the implications and fear that the gap between them and the so called Super 12 tracks is about to be blown wide open. </p> <p>'The smaller tracks are very worried that the big boys are going to do their own thing. It's the same as Premier League Football, you've got 20 big clubs and then the rest,' said Chris Curran, chief executive of Towcester racecourse in Northamptonshire. </p> <p>The media consortium has offered the 12 racecourses \u00a3200 million over a 10-year period in return for handing over worldwide television rights. The media partners will also spend \u00a325m on promoting the new service which will see the creation of a new dedicated television channel allowing viewers to bet through their screens. An online Internet betting service will be offered in tandem with racing coverage from both the BBC and Channel 4. </p> <p>There are suggestions in the industry that the deal may fall apart but Sky, which had been looking to break up the agreement, has walked away from the fight. 'We've got an agreement in principle. We're in church and we're walking down the aisle. The marriage isn't consummated yet but it is going to happen,' said Kim Deshayes, acting chief executive of the Super 12 racecourses. </p> <p>Some sceptics have questioned whether a consortium which features both Channel 4 and the BBC can work. 'C4 are brokering the deal but you can't see the two of them working together,' one source said. </p> <p>However, the consortium members stress they have already sorted out which races will be shown on which channel and have ruled out the possibility of big name events like the Grand National ending up on Channel 4 or vice versa. </p> <p>The news that the three media partners and the Super 12 are in advanced talks has sent shockwaves through some of the smaller courses which have so far been excluded from discussions. 'There is concern because there's uncertainty,' said Malcolm Armstrong, finance director with the Racecourse Association. </p> <p>Currently all 59 courses receive revenues from the Racing Channel, a dedicated television service owned and operated by Satellite Information Services, a consortium made up of Ladbrokes, William Hill, the Press Association, Racal and United News and Media. </p> <p>The smaller courses fear their slice of the broadcasting cake is about to get smaller. </p> <p>To compound the smaller courses' problems the Government has signalled that the the levy - the money which is handed back to the race tracks from off-course betting revenues (which total around \u00a35 billion a year, and which makes the levy worth around \u00a360m) - is to be abolished within the next four years. </p> <p>'Removing the statutory levy mechanism which effectively subsidises the less viable tracks will mean a radical shake-up with several of the second-tier courses likely to go to the wall. Meanwhile, of course, the big name tracks with the most attractive betting races will prosper,' John O Reilly, managing director of the offshore betting firm Ladbrokes International. </p> <p>'The days of subsidies are over. Those tracks that have volume will be OK. They've got the products people want to buy. But it doesn't bode so well for courses like Ludlow or Newton Abbot,' said another bookmaker. </p> <p>But the smaller courses do still have one weapon in their armoury. The betting industry relies on the fact that there are race events every day of the year. Thus, argue the smaller courses, the Super 12 needs to cut a deal with them if racing is to have a strong future. The Super 12 does not have the resources to stage events every day, runs the argument. 'They haven't got a product without us,' Curran said. </p> <p>Channel 4, the BBC and NTL know this, which is why this week the three media partners will attempt to woo the disgruntled 47 courses through a series of presentations. Much will be made of the share these courses will receive from interactive betting revenues, although the smaller courses remain extremely suspicious. 'We're being offered the crumbs from the rich man's table,' was the view of one racecourse executive. </p> <p>Worryingly for the smaller tracks the betting revenues won't be pooled and distributed across all the courses. So the high-profile Super 12 courses stand to make much more money from the new betting services than their smaller counterparts. </p> <p>But the three media partners believe they can offer a knock-out package to the remaining 47 courses. 'There are very strong reasons for the smaller courses to join up. We're opening up new revenue streams through interactive services,' said David Brook, director of strategy at Channel 4. </p> <p>'Between 90 and 95 per cent of people don't ever go into a betting shops. Imagine what can happen if you make the market simple and allow people to bet in their living rooms,' Deshayes said. </p> <p>But the media consortium should not become too complacent. Sky may have walked away but another player is starting to emerge. TVG, a subsidiary of Television Guide, the big-selling US magazine backed by the likes of AT&amp;T and News Corp, has started talks with the 47 courses outside the Super 12. </p> <p>TVG already operates an interactive television betting service in the US and has global ambitions. Feedback from the courses suggests they like what they are hearing. </p> <p>'This is an important market for TVG. We had hoped from the outset that we could be invited to work with the consortium but we've not had an invitation to do so.' </p> <p>Amid all this uncertainty one thing seems assured: the gap between rich and poor courses looks set to grow, that much seems a safe bet.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Apparently, Martha Lane Fox, co-founder and chief operating officer of <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"-new\">www.Lastminute.com</a>, is prone to the occasional bout of verbal pyrotechnics when things go wrong. Events of last week must have tested her temper to the utmost. As she and co-founder Brent Hoberman spent much of their time looking at new premises to house more staff, Lastminute's share price - and with it their own personal \u00a3150 million fortune - was fast diminishing. </p> <p>There must have been times when both wondered whether looking for more office space was really going to be necessary. The share price, which had risen to a first day high of 555p from an issue price of 380p, crashed down to the 270p mark. The drop created alarm among the 190,000 small investors who had managed to subscribe for shares in a placing that was 25 times oversubscribed at the retail level and considerably more at the institutional level. </p> <p>At one stage the company, which had temporarily reached a value of nearly \u00a3850m on the day of its flotation, saw its worth sink below \u00a3400m. </p> <p>Lane Fox, 27, and Hoberman, 31, were seen to be heading for very public ignominy. There was much talk of tulips and bubbles. Would the duo become icons of the Internet boom and bust theory? The fact that both came from wealthy backgrounds - Lane Fox is descended from the Marquess of Anglesey and Hoberman is an old Etonian - served only to heighten the pedestal from which they were falling. </p> <p>Accusations that the company was a triumph of style over substance and that the float had been mishandled came throughout the week. 'Overpriced, oversold and over-optimistic,' said Simon Moores of the Research Group, a consultancy that advises firms on their Internet strategy. Some were more cutting. 'If Lastminute was run by a 51-year-old man with a toupee it wouldn't have been valued at \u00a3570m,' was the blithe assessment of one analyst. </p> <p>The company's share price slumped to its nadir last Wednesday and subsequently started to head back up again, finishing the week at 332p, still some way below its issue price. However, it is clear investors continue to be nervous. Should they be? </p> <p>Supporters of the company stress several things. First, they point out that in the past few days the Nasdaq and the FTSE's Techmark 100 index have dropped considerably, factors that have conspired to drag down Lastminute's share price. </p> <p>Indeed Lycos Europe, floated in Frankfurt earlier last week, also saw its share price hammered. The company floated at 24 euros per share on Tuesday but fell to 22.8 euros the next day. </p> <p>Second, they say volumes - the quantity of Lastminute's shares being sold - are very low. They argue that of the 190,000 small investors only 15,000 were selling last week and that several institutions are now buying back in. </p> <p>Third, the share price of many technology companies - Colt, Freeserve and Orange - slumped after flotation only to bring very large smiles to investors' faces in subsequent months. </p> <p>But sceptics insist that Lastminute's share price should have been more stable. The fact that smaller investors ended up with only 35 shares each - making it difficult for them to make a quick profit because of the high dealing charges - should have locked punters in. </p> <p>Things might have seemed difficult for Lastminute over the past few days. But the real test will come next month when the company makes the first of its quarterly reports to the market. A month later, it will issue interim results. If the company's growth rates appear to be faltering, the slide in Lastminute's share price could turn into a collapse: smaller investors may end up feeling grateful they were limited to buying so few shares. </p> <p>Lastminute's supporters maintain that the figures should earn the Internet's two most visible entrepreneurs at least a temporary respite. The number of subscribers doubled from around 600,000 in December to about 1.1 million by early February. The rumours are this will be sustained over March. </p> <p>And, according to the most recent information available, the business has a 'conversion' rate of around 5 per cent: one in 20 subscribers - those people who have asked to receive information from Lastminute - have bought something from the company. </p> <p>The fact that Lastminute has banked \u00a3120m from the flotation will give the company the financial firepower to continue its expensive marketing campaign to boost its flock and increase enthusiasm for using its services. The Lastminute brand is the second most widely identified UK Internet retailer after Amazon. </p> <p>But a brand does not a company make. Lastminute is all too aware of this, which is why it is developing software to overhaul its service. By the end of June, it will offer a personalised service that knows what its users like and alerts them to late bargains. </p> <p>The company is also attempting to develop its business as it starts to roll the brand out across Europe and, ultimately, the US. On the one side it offers bargains; on the other there will be a premium service for people who simply must be on a flight or holiday on a particular date no matter what the cost. Expanding its range of gifts and other services is also key. </p> <p>These are all laudable aims if Lastminute is to justify its market capitalisation. But turning such dreams into reality is another matter. One problem investors have in working out whether Lastminute's goals are achievable is that, because it makes no profits, conventional financial analysis, the sort which ascribes values to traditional companies, goes out the window. </p> <p>So instead some analysts use discounted cash flow to try to arrive at a value. Essentially this method looks ahead to a time when the company is expected to be profitable and ascribes a current value to its future cash flows. </p> <p>'Let's assume that the company's valuation on the day it floated - \u00a3570m - is correct. So then you have to ask if that's the case what must the company look like in 10 years' time to justify that current value,' said Brett Christophers, of Informed Sources, a new-media strategy company. </p> <p>According to his calculations, Lastminute will need '30 million subscribers and a conversion rate of around 20 per cent' by 2010 to have created the cash flow necessary to justify today's \u00a3570m price tag. Furthermore, this assumes that profit margins hit 15 per cent and average spend per customer will rise to \u00a31,500 a year. And there is the small matter of sustaining earnings growth after 2010. </p> <p>Obviously these figures are flexible. Higher conversion rates would allow for lower subscriber numbers for example. But these sort of numbers highlight just how big Lastminute needs to become to justify its original value. Put another way, there are roughly 600 million people in Western Europe and the US. One per cent of them - and that's including the children - need to spend \u00a31,500 each. This is a huge challenge. </p> <p>Lastminute's first mover advantage is cited by its supporters as a reason that its dreams of global hegemony are not misplaced. But some analysts say supporters would do well to heed the example of CDnow, the online music retailer that took the US and Europe by storm. Like Lastminute, its business plan is based on harnessing the power of the Internet to give customers more choice and cheaper goods. It was and is a fundamentally clever idea, say its supporters. And, like Lastminute, it has spent a fortune on establishing its brand.to build a massive subscriber base across the globe at jaw-dropping speed. Its shares soared. as a result. </p> <p>But CDnow has failed to extract sufficient revenues from subscribers. It has only around $11m left in its war chest and is about to run out of money, according to reports in the US. </p> <p>Its share price is now plummeting. 'It will be difficult to call on the market if the company goes back for more money [by issuing more shares]. When you can't sustain the rating, you get into a real financial problem,' one analyst said. </p> <p>Sooner or later, the fundamentals have to kick in. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:jamie.doward@observer.co.uk\">jamie.doward@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

As she and co-founder Brent Hoberman spent much of their time looking at new premises to house more staff, Lastminute's share price - and with it their own personal \u00a3150 million fortune - was fast diminishing. There must have been times when both wondered whether looking for more office space was really going to be necessary. The share price, which had risen to a first day high of 555p from an issue price of 380p, crashed down to the 270p mark. The drop created alarm among the 190,000 small investors who had managed to subscribe for shares in a placing that was 25 times oversubscribed at the retail level and considerably more at the institutional level. At one stage the company, which had temporarily reached a value of nearly \u00a3850m on the day of its flotation, saw its worth sink below \u00a3400m. Lane Fox, 27, and Hoberman, 31, were seen to be heading for very public ignominy. There was much talk of tulips and bubbles. Would the duo become icons of the Internet boom and bust theory? The fact that both came from wealthy backgrounds - Lane Fox is descended from the Marquess of Anglesey and Hoberman is an old Etonian - served only to heighten the pedestal from which they were falling. Accusations that the company was a triumph of style over substance and that the float had been mishandled came throughout the week. 'Overpriced, oversold and over-optimistic,' said Simon Moores of the Research Group, a consultancy that advises firms on their Internet strategy. Some were more cutting. 'If Lastminute was run by a 51-year-old man with a toupee it wouldn't have been valued at \u00a3570m,' was the blithe assessment of one analyst. The company's share price slumped to its nadir last Wednesday and subsequently started to head back up again, finishing the week at 332p, still some way below its issue price. However, it is clear investors continue to be nervous. Should they be? Supporters of the company stress several things. First, they point out that in the past few days the Nasdaq and the FTSE's Techmark 100 index have dropped considerably, factors that have conspired to drag down Lastminute's share price. Indeed Lycos Europe, floated in Frankfurt earlier last week, also saw its share price hammered. The company floated at 24 euros per share on Tuesday but fell to 22.8 euros the next day. Second, they say volumes - the quantity of Lastminute's shares being sold - are very low. They argue that of the 190,000 small investors only 15,000 were selling last week and that several institutions are now buying back in. Third, the share price of many technology companies - Colt, Freeserve and Orange - slumped after flotation only to bring very large smiles to investors' faces in subsequent months. But sceptics insist that Lastminute's share price should have been more stable. The fact that smaller investors ended up with only 35 shares each - making it difficult for them to make a quick profit because of the high dealing charges - should have locked punters in. Things might have seemed difficult for Lastminute over the past few days. But the real test will come next month when the company makes the first of its quarterly reports to the market. A month later, it will issue interim results. If the company's growth rates appear to be faltering, the slide in Lastminute's share price could turn into a collapse: smaller investors may end up feeling grateful they were limited to buying so few shares. Lastminute's supporters maintain that the figures should earn the Internet's two most visible entrepreneurs at least a temporary respite. The number of subscribers doubled from around 600,000 in December to about 1.1 million by early February. The rumours are this will be sustained over March. And, according to the most recent information available, the business has a 'conversion' rate of around 5 per cent: one in 20 subscribers - those people who have asked to receive information from Lastminute - have bought something from the company. The fact that Lastminute has banked \u00a3120m from the flotation will give the company the financial firepower to continue its expensive marketing campaign to boost its flock and increase enthusiasm for using its services. The Lastminute brand is the second most widely identified UK Internet retailer after Amazon. But a brand does not a company make. Lastminute is all too aware of this, which is why it is developing software to overhaul its service. By the end of June, it will offer a personalised service that knows what its users like and alerts them to late bargains. The company is also attempting to develop its business as it starts to roll the brand out across Europe and, ultimately, the US. On the one side it offers bargains; on the other there will be a premium service for people who simply must be on a flight or holiday on a particular date no matter what the cost. Expanding its range of gifts and other services is also key. These are all laudable aims if Lastminute is to justify its market capitalisation. But turning such dreams into reality is another matter. One problem investors have in working out whether Lastminute's goals are achievable is that, because it makes no profits, conventional financial analysis, the sort which ascribes values to traditional companies, goes out the window. So instead some analysts use discounted cash flow to try to arrive at a value. Essentially this method looks ahead to a time when the company is expected to be profitable and ascribes a current value to its future cash flows. 'Let's assume that the company's valuation on the day it floated - \u00a3570m - is correct. So then you have to ask if that's the case what must the company look like in 10 years' time to justify that current value,' said Brett Christophers, of Informed Sources, a new-media strategy company. According to his calculations, Lastminute will need '30 million subscribers and a conversion rate of around 20 per cent' by 2010 to have created the cash flow necessary to justify today's \u00a3570m price tag. Furthermore, this assumes that profit margins hit 15 per cent and average spend per customer will rise to \u00a31,500 a year. And there is the small matter of sustaining earnings growth after 2010. Obviously these figures are flexible. Higher conversion rates would allow for lower subscriber numbers for example. But these sort of numbers highlight just how big Lastminute needs to become to justify its original value. Put another way, there are roughly 600 million people in Western Europe and the US. One per cent of them - and that's including the children - need to spend \u00a31,500 each. This is a huge challenge. Lastminute's first mover advantage is cited by its supporters as a reason that its dreams of global hegemony are not misplaced. But some analysts say supporters would do well to heed the example of CDnow, the online music retailer that took the US and Europe by storm. Like Lastminute, its business plan is based on harnessing the power of the Internet to give customers more choice and cheaper goods. It was and is a fundamentally clever idea, say its supporters. And, like Lastminute, it has spent a fortune on establishing its brand.to build a massive subscriber base across the globe at jaw-dropping speed. Its shares soared. as a result. But CDnow has failed to extract sufficient revenues from subscribers. It has only around $11m left in its war chest and is about to run out of money, according to reports in the US. Its share price is now plummeting. 'It will be difficult to call on the market if the company goes back for more money [by issuing more shares]. When you can't sustain the rating, you get into a real financial problem,' one analyst said. Sooner or later, the fundamentals have to kick in. jamie.doward@observer.co.uk",

But new uses for the sprawling site - most of which will be surplus to the requirements of the new venture capital-backed MG Car Company - are hardly the main headache of the Advantage task force. The 50,000 livelihoods that depend directly and indirectly on Rover, and the knock-on effects on the regional economy, are the main concerns of Alex Stephenson, Advantage's energetic and - unusually for a quango - respected chairman. </p> <p>This time, at least, Stephenson has \u00a3152m of aid, granted by the Government last weekend, to deal with the problem.

Conceived by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott as the forerunners of full-blown devolution to the regions, they have suffered sniping as toothless tigers trapped in a jungle of bureaucracy.

They are shadowed by Regional Chambers, representing local councils, business and voluntary bodies, including trades unions. </p> <p>'There's a real tension. The Government has set them up to placate pressure from the regions but has no idea what they are for,' said Dr Jamie Gough, lecturer in industrial geography at the University of Northumbria.

The reason the grant was so forthcoming was that the money had already been earmarked, after much wrangling, for BMW to help Rover develop new models. So it had already cleared the Treasury, which holds the purse strings but rarely receives the flak for not loosening them. </p> <p>All the RDAs, including Advantage West Midlands, will have their final budgets for the year set this week. So far, the Government has agreed an extra \u00a346m overall, a rise of 4.4 per cent to take the total to \u00a3912m, excluding the Longbridge grant. But within that, some of the hardest pressed regions - the North East and the South West - face cuts, while wealthier areas such as East Anglia and the South East will enjoy gains. </p> <p>'We are still pushing for an increase.

'This is a place where the UK has got it right,' he affirms. </p> <p>Accordingly, the lanky Anglophile Monks (who was consulted) is pleased that reform plans announced recently by the DTI leave shareholder value as the driving principle for company management, and back away from the stakeholder emphasis put forward by the Labour Party in opposition. </p> <p>However, his pleasure is conditional on it being understood that 'most shareholders are not nano-second arbitrageurs nor computer indexers, but rather the long-term beneficiaries of pension funds. These shareholders want their companies run so as to provide retirement income in a clean, safe and civil society.' Making sure companies are run like that is what, for Monks, corporate governance is all about. </p> <p>In this context, although professing respect for the position of stakeholder advocates such as John Kay, late of Oxford Business School, and the FT's John Plender, Monks maintains that the shareholders versus stakeholders struggle is a fight only for someone determined to have it, since in the long term a company's profitability (and shareholder return) is indivisible from the health of the society it operates in. Knowing at first hand how hard it is to make a profit in the first place, Monks believes that to insist on multiple goals risks a fatal dissipation of management concentration. </p> <p>If Monks has no hesitation in asserting that the UK is the most favourable country in the world for the exercise of corporate governance, however, that is little comfort for the errant corporations that Lens and its UK partnership, Hermes Lens Asset Management, invest in. Unlike in the US, UK shareholders have the power to call an extraordinary general meeting and hold directors to account. </p> <p>Monks is also skilled in using less formal channels. He says that in the UK, 'you can talk privately and discreetly with the chief executive and directors and get things done'. In the US, that can only be done in a blaze of publicity through the press - an institution with which Monks maintains cordial and reciprocally profitable relations. </p> <p>The Internet has given Lens another potent instrument. Its website (<a href=\"http://www.lens-inc.com\">www.lens-inc.com)</a> is a huge corporate governance resource, currently waging an entertaining battle to persuade top US companies to disclose details of CEOs' contracts. </p> <p>Yet although the environment is relatively favourable, UK corporate governance is by no means a done deal. On the contrary: one worry is the constant increase in the sway of global executives, now more powerful (partly because less accountable) than any political leader. So the need to insist on accountability is ever-growing. </p> <p>The issue of executive pay is less pressing in the UK than the US, where the efforts of headhunters, compensation consultants and lawyers have made extraordinary perks routine. (As well as use of the corporate jet for his own commuting, one US CEO had first-class airfares for his mother written into his deal.) But it still needs to be impressed on executives that with their seven-digit pay packets, they accept 'both a job going beyond the custodial and the need to demonstrate that they are growing the savings entrusted to them safely and well'. </p> <p>A further priority - and an important part of Monks' life's work - is persuading shareholders to face up to their responsibilities as company owners, and in particular to intervene where governance principles are being ignored or abused. In practice, this means pension and insurance funds, just 200 of which, he points out, own around 17 per cent of all world stocks for their ultimate beneficiaries. </p> <p>There is already evidence to suggest that good governance pays. Lens itself is a good example: its portfolio has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index since its inception in 1992. And a McKinsey study found that investors will pay a premium of up to 16 per cent for companies with exemplary governance. To bolster support for the activism thesis, Monks is working on a theoretical investment model which he believes will show that companies that aggressively externalise their costs on to society (polluters, tobacco companies) do less well in the long term than those that are socially responsible. </p> <p>Although Monks is not shy of making his presence felt (at 6ft 6ins he hardly fades into the crowd), not all his interventions are controversial. As the newly appointed president of the Centre for Board Effectiveness at Henley Management College, he credits his predecessor Sir Adrian Cadbury with almost singlehandedly creating concepts now recognised as corporate governance worldwide. </p> <p>From this vantage point, and from his own experience, Monks has enormous sympathy for directors who have no direct power of their own, only as a team, and who are faced with a 'book of Genesis' of regulation but much less guidance as to how they should work in practice. 'Many decisions have to be taken with incomplete information under poor time conditions,' he says. 'We need outside directors comfortable with change and able to bring a vision of that to the people running the business.' </p> <p>This, in fact, sums up the major challenge for corporate governance in the UK. 'The modality of business is change,' Monks says. But this poses severe problems for traditional industry, such as Rover. But whereas the US adores change and the volatility that goes with it, here there is more that people wish to preserve. At present that seems to give the US an advantage: but is adapting mindlessly to change the answer? Monks points to his alma mater, Cambridge, as proof that the old isn't incompatible with the new, and that venture capital can sit well with ancient portals as well as virtual ones. </p> <p>'The UK is superbly positioned for this kind of future,' he says. </p> <p> simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</p>",

Unlike in the US, UK shareholders have the power to call an extraordinary general meeting and hold directors to account. Monks is also skilled in using less formal channels. He says that in the UK, 'you can talk privately and discreetly with the chief executive and directors and get things done'. In the US, that can only be done in a blaze of publicity through the press - an institution with which Monks maintains cordial and reciprocally profitable relations. The Internet has given Lens another potent instrument. Its website (www.lens-inc.com) is a huge corporate governance resource, currently waging an entertaining battle to persuade top US companies to disclose details of CEOs' contracts. Yet although the environment is relatively favourable, UK corporate governance is by no means a done deal. On the contrary: one worry is the constant increase in the sway of global executives, now more powerful (partly because less accountable) than any political leader. So the need to insist on accountability is ever-growing. The issue of executive pay is less pressing in the UK than the US, where the efforts of headhunters, compensation consultants and lawyers have made extraordinary perks routine. (As well as use of the corporate jet for his own commuting, one US CEO had first-class airfares for his mother written into his deal.) But it still needs to be impressed on executives that with their seven-digit pay packets, they accept 'both a job going beyond the custodial and the need to demonstrate that they are growing the savings entrusted to them safely and well'. A further priority - and an important part of Monks' life's work - is persuading shareholders to face up to their responsibilities as company owners, and in particular to intervene where governance principles are being ignored or abused. In practice, this means pension and insurance funds, just 200 of which, he points out, own around 17 per cent of all world stocks for their ultimate beneficiaries. There is already evidence to suggest that good governance pays. Lens itself is a good example: its portfolio has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index since its inception in 1992. And a McKinsey study found that investors will pay a premium of up to 16 per cent for companies with exemplary governance. To bolster support for the activism thesis, Monks is working on a theoretical investment model which he believes will show that companies that aggressively externalise their costs on to society (polluters, tobacco companies) do less well in the long term than those that are socially responsible. Although Monks is not shy of making his presence felt (at 6ft 6ins he hardly fades into the crowd), not all his interventions are controversial. As the newly appointed president of the Centre for Board Effectiveness at Henley Management College, he credits his predecessor Sir Adrian Cadbury with almost singlehandedly creating concepts now recognised as corporate governance worldwide. From this vantage point, and from his own experience, Monks has enormous sympathy for directors who have no direct power of their own, only as a team, and who are faced with a 'book of Genesis' of regulation but much less guidance as to how they should work in practice. 'Many decisions have to be taken with incomplete information under poor time conditions,' he says. 'We need outside directors comfortable with change and able to bring a vision of that to the people running the business.' This, in fact, sums up the major challenge for corporate governance in the UK. 'The modality of business is change,' Monks says. But this poses severe problems for traditional industry, such as Rover. But whereas the US adores change and the volatility that goes with it, here there is more that people wish to preserve. At present that seems to give the US an advantage: but is adapting mindlessly to change the answer? Monks points to his alma mater, Cambridge, as proof that the old isn't incompatible with the new, and that venture capital can sit well with ancient portals as well as virtual ones. 'The UK is superbly positioned for this kind of future,' he says. simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Fast-moving solicitors could save their clients thousands of pounds tomorrow by completing home sales before the increases in stamp duty on more expensive homes takes effect. </p> <p>The new rates will affect only sales completed on or after Tuesday. But as long as the contracts were exchanged before the end of Budget day, last Tuesday, you can still pay the old, lower, rates - even if your purchase is completed after that date. </p> <p>Anticipating that the Chancellor would crank up stamp duty rates, buyers and sellers were still rushing to exchange contracts on their deals right up to Budget day, estate agents say. </p> <p>However, even if contracts have not yet been exchanged, you could still get your sale through at the lower levy rates, as long as exchange and completion happen before Tuesday. This would mean these two normally separate stages in a house sale will have to be simultaneous. </p> <p>'It is all do-able if you have the will,' says Paddington-based solicitor William Heath. </p> <p>Local authority searches can be done within a day if the conveyancer does them directly rather than relying on the post, he says. For a same-day exchange and completion, the money for the transaction would have to be available instantly, and both parties would have to have agreed all terms. </p> <p>'Apart from this, there is no real difficulty,' he says. </p> <p>Someone buying a house for \u00a3600,000 could save \u00a33,000 in stamp duty by completing the sale before Tuesday, though Heath doubts whether such savings are really important to a buyer spending over half a million pounds. </p> <p>In his Budget, Gordon Brown announced that stamp duty on purchases of residential and commercial property would rise from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent for transactions of \u00a3250,000, and from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent for properties costing more than \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Stamp duty on purchases of homes priced at between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3249,000 remains at 1 per cent, and there will still be no levy to pay on transactions involving less than \u00a360,000. </p> <p>But anyone hoping that the increases will cool the overheated property market, particularly in the South of England, may be disappointed. </p> <p>On the contrary: they are likely to have a modest inflationary impact, argues John Gully of the Portman building society.

      "bodyText": "Fast-moving solicitors could save their clients thousands of pounds tomorrow by completing home sales before the increases in stamp duty on more expensive homes takes effect. The new rates will affect only sales completed on or after Tuesday. But as long as the contracts were exchanged before the end of Budget day, last Tuesday, you can still pay the old, lower, rates - even if your purchase is completed after that date. Anticipating that the Chancellor would crank up stamp duty rates, buyers and sellers were still rushing to exchange contracts on their deals right up to Budget day, estate agents say. However, even if contracts have not yet been exchanged, you could still get your sale through at the lower levy rates, as long as exchange and completion happen before Tuesday. This would mean these two normally separate stages in a house sale will have to be simultaneous. 'It is all do-able if you have the will,' says Paddington-based solicitor William Heath. Local authority searches can be done within a day if the conveyancer does them directly rather than relying on the post, he says. For a same-day exchange and completion, the money for the transaction would have to be available instantly, and both parties would have to have agreed all terms. 'Apart from this, there is no real difficulty,' he says. Someone buying a house for \u00a3600,000 could save \u00a33,000 in stamp duty by completing the sale before Tuesday, though Heath doubts whether such savings are really important to a buyer spending over half a million pounds. In his Budget, Gordon Brown announced that stamp duty on purchases of residential and commercial property would rise from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent for transactions of \u00a3250,000, and from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent for properties costing more than \u00a3500,000. Stamp duty on purchases of homes priced at between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3249,000 remains at 1 per cent, and there will still be no levy to pay on transactions involving less than \u00a360,000. But anyone hoping that the increases will cool the overheated property market, particularly in the South of England, may be disappointed. On the contrary: they are likely to have a modest inflationary impact, argues John Gully of the Portman building society. He believes that vendors are likely to react by raising their asking price in an effort to cover the extra duty they will have to pay on their own next house purchase. Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, said he thought the tax rise was aimed at bringing the level of UK taxes closer to those elsewhere in the European Union. 'As it's having no effect on dampening house prices, our suspicion is it's a back-door way of harmonising taxes with the rest of Europe,' he said. The sudden step up in the tax rate at the \u00a3250,000 level could cause distortions in house prices.

The Inland Revenue says 95 per cent of residential property transactions are unaffected, as they involve less than \u00a3250,000. Of those that are hit, Gully believes people in the South of England will be far harder hit than those in the North.",

Those who buy via the growing band of discount brokers, however, could save up to \u00a3350 or more on a \u00a37,000 equity Isa. </p> <p>An average unit trust has an initial charge of 5 per cent and annual charges of 1 per cent. Out of these charges, the groups will usually pay their main distribution channel, the IFAs who sell their products, a 3 per cent marketing allowance and a 0.5 per cent renewal commission to reward them for their ongoing service to the client over the term of the investment. Not all investors need advice however, and some are quite happy to make their own decisions. But for those who go direct to the company for the fund of their choice, the charges are exactly the same. </p> <p>People can't understand why going direct isn't rewarded says Craig Wetton, chief executive officer of Bath independent financial adviser Chartwell. 'They think they are being smart and avoiding the commission structure, but companies can't afford to offend the independent financial advisers (IFAs) who support them by selling their products cheaper. So what would otherwise be paid to an IFA is kept by the company.' </p> <p>This absurd situation is being taken advantage of by a growing number of execution-only discount brokers. They don't offer advice; they simply deliver your application form and cheque to the selected company and then rebate part or all of the initial charge (usually at least 3 per cent but often up to as much as 5 per cent or even more). </p> <p>Chartwell, in fact, has ruffled a few feathers recently by announcing that it will rebate all initial commission plus half of any annual commission. </p> <p>HCF Isa Partnership, based in Stanmore, takes the full renewal commission, although as a special offer it is effectively rebating half the first year's renewal on any Jupiter funds. </p> <p>Don Clark, managing director of TQ Direct Choice reckons that the reason more people don't take the discount route is partly education. 'They don't know we exist; they don't understand how we can sell funds cheaper; or they are worried about security or being bombarded with junk mail.' </p> <p>On the security angle, he points out that legitimate firms will never handle client's money.

      "bodyText": "Cutting out the middleman usually means lower prices, but not so in the investment industry. Investors who think they will get a better deal by buying direct from the product provider will often be disappointed. Those who buy via the growing band of discount brokers, however, could save up to \u00a3350 or more on a \u00a37,000 equity Isa. An average unit trust has an initial charge of 5 per cent and annual charges of 1 per cent. Out of these charges, the groups will usually pay their main distribution channel, the IFAs who sell their products, a 3 per cent marketing allowance and a 0.5 per cent renewal commission to reward them for their ongoing service to the client over the term of the investment. Not all investors need advice however, and some are quite happy to make their own decisions. But for those who go direct to the company for the fund of their choice, the charges are exactly the same. People can't understand why going direct isn't rewarded says Craig Wetton, chief executive officer of Bath independent financial adviser Chartwell. 'They think they are being smart and avoiding the commission structure, but companies can't afford to offend the independent financial advisers (IFAs) who support them by selling their products cheaper. So what would otherwise be paid to an IFA is kept by the company.' This absurd situation is being taken advantage of by a growing number of execution-only discount brokers. They don't offer advice; they simply deliver your application form and cheque to the selected company and then rebate part or all of the initial charge (usually at least 3 per cent but often up to as much as 5 per cent or even more). Chartwell, in fact, has ruffled a few feathers recently by announcing that it will rebate all initial commission plus half of any annual commission. HCF Isa Partnership, based in Stanmore, takes the full renewal commission, although as a special offer it is effectively rebating half the first year's renewal on any Jupiter funds. Don Clark, managing director of TQ Direct Choice reckons that the reason more people don't take the discount route is partly education. 'They don't know we exist; they don't understand how we can sell funds cheaper; or they are worried about security or being bombarded with junk mail.' On the security angle, he points out that legitimate firms will never handle client's money. Investment cheques should always be made payable to the investment group itself rather than the discounter. He also guarantees that his firm will not junk mail clients. All of the leading firms now have their own web sites and the general view is that it won't be long before on-screen dealing is widely available. Selling Isas direct is big business for the investment groups. But as Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services suggests, unless there are no initial charges and no commission payable, or the investor has left things until the very last minute, it would always pay to buy via a discount broker.

Fund managers have traditionally justified the 5 per cent or so they charge up front on the grounds that the money is spent on detailed analysis to achieve superior returns.

Some funds charge 1 per cent or less as an initial charge, but the vast majority charge about 5 per cent. </p> <p>The second charge is an annual management fee. This pays the fund manager to manage and administer the fund you have chosen, and may include a portion to cover the cost of renewal commission for your financial adviser. Again the annual management fees can vary widely, from 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent and even 2 per cent in some cases. Both initial and annual charges include an element of profit for the fund manager. </p> <p>The cheapest funds tend to be index trackers, which passively invest in all shares included in a particular index, such as the FTSE All Share index, without regard to the outlook for those shares. These funds often have no initial charge, and an annual management fee of about 0.5 per cent. They are cheap because they do not require highly paid fund managers to pick stocks. </p> <p>In contrast, 'actively managed' funds, where the fund manager aims to pick the winners and avoid the losers, charge as much as 6 per cent initially, and have annual management charges as high as 1.75 per cent a year. Active fund managers argue that the expertise and research necessary to produce good returns costs money, and that skimping on charges can prove a false economy. </p> <p>However, a quick look at the performance tables shows that high charges are no guarantee of good performance. Figures from performance analyst WM show that only one in every four UK fund managers has beaten the market in any five year period, and over 20 years, only 15 per cent of managers out performed the market before charges were deducted. Schroder UK Enterprise and Perpetual UK Growth, which are both worth more than \u00a31bn and have enough investors to fill Wembley Stadium, have initial charges of 5.25 per cent and annual charges of 1.5 per cent and 1.25 per cent respectively. </p> <p>But their performance has done little to justify the costs - over three years Schroder UK Enterprise languishes in the 110th position out of 129 UK growth funds, while Perpetual UK Growth is just one off the bottom in 128th position. </p> <p>A few actively managed funds have chosen to submit to voluntary Government Cat benchmark guidelines, which limit total expenses to less than 1 per cent a year. Fitzrovia Associates, which specialises in investment fund expenses research, undertook the study for Norwich Union to compare performance of these actively managed Cat funds with actively-managed funds not adhering to the Cat cost guidelines. </p> <p>Over the last 11 months, actively managed Cat-standard funds grew by an average of 27.38 per cent, compared with 5.51 per cent for the non-Cat standard funds. Worse still, more than half the actively managed non-Cat funds have yet to make any money - they are still struggling to make up the cost of their initial charge. </p> <p>Mark Skinner, sales and marketing director at Norwich Union Investment Funds, says the superior performance of the Cat standard funds is caused by having most, if not all, your money invested and earning for you from day one. </p> <p>'Clearly it is low charges, as guaranteed by the Cat standard, which make a difference to the real returns to the investor. But very few fund managers are willing to cut their charges and sacrifice their profit margins. With these sorts of vested interests, it is no surprise that so few providers are willing to offer Cat standard value to their investors. However, as independent research continues to underline their importance, actively managed Cat standard funds cannot be dismissed as the poor relations. Far from it, in this financial year, their track record both has been considerably superior.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, as few actively managed unit trusts and open ended investment companies (OEICs) offer such low charges, it is difficult to form a balanced and low cost portfolio. Graeme Currie of independent financial advisers Alan Steel Asset Management says that when selecting for clients, it is important to get the right mix of funds to meet their objectives: growth, income, capital preservation, and lower volatility. </p> <p>'If you focus solely on low charges you may end up with a portfolio that does meet your overall goals,' he says. </p> <p>By selecting only Cat standard funds, investors would exclude many smaller company funds, technology funds, and Far Eastern funds. </p> <p>However, further research by Fitzrovia International has revealed that the size-weighted average total expenses of investment trusts are 60 per cent lower than that of retail equity-based unit trusts and OEICs. The average expense for investment trusts is 0.83 per cent, 0.55 per cent less than the average 1.38 per cent for unit trusts and OEICs. </p> <p>Daniel Godfrey, director general of the Association of Investment Trust Companies, says: 'The study shows that large investment trusts are an exceptionally efficient way of managing money.

A US company is mounting a challenge to a consortium made up of Channel 4, the BBC and cable firm NTL. </p> <p>The consortium is in exclusive negotiations with Britain's top racecourses, the Super 12, and will start talks tomorrow with the 47 others. </p> <p>But TVG, a subsidiary of US magazine giant TV Guide, a company whose sharehold ers include News Corporation and AT&amp;T, wants to prise the 47 smaller tracks away from the Channel 4-led bid. TVG, which has secured media rights to some of the largest tracks in the US, is looking to build a global horseracing network, and is keen to put British races on its channel. </p> <p>The news that it has been talking to some of the UK courses will shock Channel 4, which had been having discussions with TVG about swapping media rights. </p> <p>However, Peter Burnand, TGV's UK representative, said it had now decided on a different strategy. 'We had hoped from the outset that we could be invited to work with the consortium, but we've not had an invitation to do so. We've moved to shore up our position, and the message that we have been putting across [to the courses] is that we are furlongs ahead.

      "bodyText": "The battle to broadcast British racing on television and the Internet is set to become a two-horse race. A US company is mounting a challenge to a consortium made up of Channel 4, the BBC and cable firm NTL. The consortium is in exclusive negotiations with Britain's top racecourses, the Super 12, and will start talks tomorrow with the 47 others. But TVG, a subsidiary of US magazine giant TV Guide, a company whose sharehold ers include News Corporation and AT&amp;T, wants to prise the 47 smaller tracks away from the Channel 4-led bid. TVG, which has secured media rights to some of the largest tracks in the US, is looking to build a global horseracing network, and is keen to put British races on its channel. The news that it has been talking to some of the UK courses will shock Channel 4, which had been having discussions with TVG about swapping media rights. However, Peter Burnand, TGV's UK representative, said it had now decided on a different strategy. 'We had hoped from the outset that we could be invited to work with the consortium, but we've not had an invitation to do so. We've moved to shore up our position, and the message that we have been putting across [to the courses] is that we are furlongs ahead. We are a player.' At the heart of both media groups' strategies is a desire to turn racing into an interactive sport, with viewers able to bet on races through their television screens. The Channel 4 consortium plans to launch a dedicated racing channel on satellite and cable. TVG is rumoured to be seeking an alliance with Sky. Some observers suggest racing would suffer if the courses split into two groups. However Kim Deshayes, acting chief executive of the Super 12, said: 'We would very much like the other courses to come on board with us.'",
