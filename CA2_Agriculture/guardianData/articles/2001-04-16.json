Paul McCreesh, the Consort's director, is drastic in his approach. His aim is to expose - to use TS Eliot's phrase - \"the skull beneath the skin\" of the music, to strip it down uncompromisingly to its bare essentials. Bach's double orchestra becomes two small groups of instrumentalists and the choral lines are allotted to single voices. Four soloists carry both the narrative and the arias, which means the singers cast as the Evangelist (Mark Padmore) and Jesus (Peter Harvey) have to leap suddenly out of character for moments of reflection and emotional commentary. </p> <p>The result, contrary to expectations, is anything but austere, though it leads to a performance that doesn't always scale the tragic heights it should. There's a strong element of physicality in McCreesh's music-making, mirrored in the swirling, balletic gestures with which he conducts. He lays a hefty emphasis on how the explicit vividness of Bach's instrumental writing dictates an almost physical response. The instrumental obbligati trickle round the singers like rivulets of tears; the string chords accompanying the contralto's contemplation of the scourging slice the air. </p> <p>The nakedness of suffering the work explores is reflected in McCreesh's exposure of the naked vulnerability of voices and instruments. As a result, you are sometimes aware of imprecision in the playing, although the singing is more cohesive. Harvey's Jesus mingles resigned divinity with palpable, at times excruciating, terror and doubt. Padmore's Evangelist is morally concerned, flaring into anger at the betrayal, and dismissing Judas with contempt, when a dispassionate approach might be more appropriate. </p> <p>The soprano, Julia Gooding, is warmly vibrant and humane - earthbound rather than angelic. Contralto Sarah Connolly is, by contrast, a hieratic icon of grief. McCreesh sharply differentiates his two solo-voiced choirs, with the bright sound of the first counterpoised with the mellower tones of the second. Given the small numbers involved, the balance occasionally comes adrift. The all-important chorale that threads its way through the opening chorus, for instance, was inaudible. </p> <p>Much of it is admirable, though much of it is also flawed. McCreesh claims authenticity for his procedures, though what really matters in the St Matthew Passion, as in any great Bach performance, is the cumulative impact, the ability to judge the relentless, yet measured pace of the work's emotional development. McCreesh often hovers in the moment, rather than seeing the whole. The second half, in particular, progresses by fits and starts when it should be absolutely seamless. He's unfailingly impressive, but you don't emerge from his performance shattered, drained and profoundly moved, as you should.</p>",

Performing Zelenka's Lamentations of Jeremiah alongside one of Bach's cantatas, Robert King and his King's Consort demonstrated that Zelenka's music does at least make comparisons to Bach feasible.

Although it was played sensitively, King's stolid tempos at times threatened to hold back the musicians' momentum - and they, in turn, seemed to stifle alto soloist Robin Blaze. However, tenor James Gilchrist managed to convey the expressive yearning of Mein Verlangen. They were joined in the two choral numbers by bass Peter Harvey, singing above just audible florid recorders; soprano Rebecca Outram completed the vocal quartet for these numbers, but her bright, soloistic voice did not blend well with the others. </p> <p>Zelenka wrote six Lamentations, a pair each for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Saturday. They were never intended to be performed on the same day - let alone one after the other, as they were in the second half. Each one is like a mini Bach cantata, scored for alto, tenor or bass soloist with a different combination of instruments. And each has sections of declamatory music introduced by a more lyrical passage in which is sung the name of the Hebrew letter that begins the original verse. There is variety in Zelenka's music; indeed, there are lively, long-breathed melodies worthy of Bach. But after the third or fourth such piece one longed for a change in the format. </p> <p>Harvey launched resonantly into the first Lamentation and he and Gilchrist negotiated well the many changes of pace within each piece. However, all six are a test of stamina for the soloist, and only Blaze seemed fresh throughout. </p> <p>Happily, Zelenka saved his most beguiling music for the final day's settings, and the musicians responded: the cellos relished their duet in the fifth Lamentation, while a long-awaited bassoon melody in the sixth added new texture.

      "body": "<p>More than 2m customers of the Co-operative bank are to be polled for their views on genetically modified food, animal testing and human rights as the bank begins the task of rewriting its ethical investment policy. </p> <p>Almost 10 years after publishing its first ethical policy, the Co-op bank plans to update it for the 21st century at a time when two of the pressing issues of the last decade - fur trading and hunting - appear increasingly outdated. </p> <p>In what it terms the biggest ever ethical consultation exercise, the bank plans to send customers a lengthy questionnaire. </p> <p>The bank expects issues such as genetic engineering, animal experimentation, global climate change, human rights and the arms trade to be among issues its customers will want to debate during the exercise which it hopes to complete by May 2002. </p> <p>The Co-op first embarked on such a wide consultation of customers in 1991 which led to the bank pledging not to back a variety of companies, particularly those involved in human rights abuses, the arms trade and animal testing. </p> <p>Because of changes in recent years, the Co-op bank expects new issues to be added to the list of unethical practices by next year. </p> <p>For instance, genetically modified food and genetic engineering of other products is one of the more recent subjects to be thrust on to the agenda. Attempts to ban hunting with hounds and stop trading in furs mean that these may now be on their way off the list of investments to avoid. </p> <p>Some issues are likely to survive, however. \"The arms trade goes on and on and human rights in general,\" a Co-op bank spokesman said. </p> <p>The ethical policy, last updated in 1998, covers more than avoiding business with companies that abuse human rights and animal welfare. It requires the bank to avoid companies which contribute to \"global climate change and acid rain\" as well as avoiding currency speculation which might damage the country's financial health. </p> <p>The Co-op, which believes a third of all new customers join because of its ethical stance, checks potential clients against its ethical policy before lending them money or offering them other financial services. </p> <p>It has not emulated financial firms which run investment funds with an overt ethical stance. But its wide-ranging ethical approach has influenced the way other companies invest money on their customers' behalf. </p> <p>Leading pension funds increasingly have departments responsible for \"socially responsible investment\" , which update investors with an \"ethical audit\" every year. Even the stock exchange is to get a new index which companies can enter only if they meet certain ethical criteria. </p> <p>The FTSE4Good index may help to generate more ethical investment because it will allow big investment firms to set up funds that track the index. Around 60% of companies are expected to qualify for inclusion in the index when it is initiated in July. </p> <p>The Co-op bank insists that its ethical policy cannot be analysed in this way, with companies being barred or included on a rigid blacklist. This is because it only scrutinises potential customers when they approach the bank for financing and does not disclose if it has turned away customers, citing client confidentiality. </p> <p>The Co-op has completed three consultation exercises with its own customers in recent years which illuminate the public's changing passions about certain issues. </p> <p>Ten years ago, financing oppressive regimes and sale of arms to them topped the list of concerns among the Co-op's customers. By 1994, those issues remained important but concerns had increased about animal testing for cosmetic purposes, factory farming and animal fur trade. </p> <p>In 1998, the Co-op found that tobacco manufacturing had slipped back among its customers' concerns. The surveys found, however, a consistent amount of concern about financing oppressive regimes. </p> <p>The bank has also tried to raise new issues during its surveys, such as introducing questions on money laundering in 1994. Answers to questions about currency speculators were measured for the first time in 1998. </p> <p>In the same year, 8% of customers were starting to become aware of genetic modification and raised the issue for inclusion at the next consultation. </p> <p>For the Co-op bank, sending out questionnaires to its 2m customers is the easy part. Getting them to fill them in is harder; in 1998 only 2% participated in the consultation exercise.</p>",

The bank expects issues such as genetic engineering, animal experimentation, global climate change, human rights and the arms trade to be among issues its customers will want to debate during the exercise which it hopes to complete by May 2002. The Co-op first embarked on such a wide consultation of customers in 1991 which led to the bank pledging not to back a variety of companies, particularly those involved in human rights abuses, the arms trade and animal testing. Because of changes in recent years, the Co-op bank expects new issues to be added to the list of unethical practices by next year. For instance, genetically modified food and genetic engineering of other products is one of the more recent subjects to be thrust on to the agenda. Attempts to ban hunting with hounds and stop trading in furs mean that these may now be on their way off the list of investments to avoid. Some issues are likely to survive, however. \"The arms trade goes on and on and human rights in general,\" a Co-op bank spokesman said. The ethical policy, last updated in 1998, covers more than avoiding business with companies that abuse human rights and animal welfare. It requires the bank to avoid companies which contribute to \"global climate change and acid rain\" as well as avoiding currency speculation which might damage the country's financial health. The Co-op, which believes a third of all new customers join because of its ethical stance, checks potential clients against its ethical policy before lending them money or offering them other financial services. It has not emulated financial firms which run investment funds with an overt ethical stance. But its wide-ranging ethical approach has influenced the way other companies invest money on their customers' behalf. Leading pension funds increasingly have departments responsible for \"socially responsible investment\" , which update investors with an \"ethical audit\" every year. Even the stock exchange is to get a new index which companies can enter only if they meet certain ethical criteria. The FTSE4Good index may help to generate more ethical investment because it will allow big investment firms to set up funds that track the index. Around 60% of companies are expected to qualify for inclusion in the index when it is initiated in July. The Co-op bank insists that its ethical policy cannot be analysed in this way, with companies being barred or included on a rigid blacklist. This is because it only scrutinises potential customers when they approach the bank for financing and does not disclose if it has turned away customers, citing client confidentiality. The Co-op has completed three consultation exercises with its own customers in recent years which illuminate the public's changing passions about certain issues. Ten years ago, financing oppressive regimes and sale of arms to them topped the list of concerns among the Co-op's customers. By 1994, those issues remained important but concerns had increased about animal testing for cosmetic purposes, factory farming and animal fur trade. In 1998, the Co-op found that tobacco manufacturing had slipped back among its customers' concerns. The surveys found, however, a consistent amount of concern about financing oppressive regimes. The bank has also tried to raise new issues during its surveys, such as introducing questions on money laundering in 1994. Answers to questions about currency speculators were measured for the first time in 1998. In the same year, 8% of customers were starting to become aware of genetic modification and raised the issue for inclusion at the next consultation. For the Co-op bank, sending out questionnaires to its 2m customers is the easy part. Getting them to fill them in is harder; in 1998 only 2% participated in the consultation exercise.",

Bayern, like United chasing a hat-trick of domestic titles, were derailed by the three goals from Ebbe Sand which took Schalke to the top, and that after Carsten Jancker had given them an early lead. \"We were far too nervous in defence,\" said Bayern's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

The visitors opened the scoring with a deflected shot after seven minutes but though Valencia's midfielder Vicente made it 1-1, Dan Eggen sealed Alaves' victory with a fine header after 74 minutes.

SLAP HAFFEY said one, HAPLESS HAFFEY another - and in spite of such legendary predecessors in the lore as Harry Rennie, John Thomson and Jimmy Cowan, Scotland's reputation for insecure goalkeeping took root there and then.

Celtic's opponents in the final will be Hibernian, who, thanks to two goals from the man of the match John O'Neil, comprehensively swept aside Livingston of the First Division 3-0 on Saturday. The Edinburgh club reached the final of the tournament for the first time since 1979 - and will now attempt to win it for the first time in 99 years. \u0095 Jim Baxter, the former Scotland, Rangers, Sunderland and Nottingham Forest wing-half, died of cancer on Saturday aged 61. He was capped 34 times, won three titles and three cups at Rangers and had his finest hour when Scotland beat England in 1967. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Tomorrow, as Leeds and Arsenal are trying to make the Champions Cup semi-finals, Chelsea travel to Spurs aiming for their third consecutive away win, with victory vital if their late surge up the table is to be rewarded.</p> <p>\"We all dream a lot about the Champions League but I think it's a little bit difficult,\" said Poyet, whose mishit volley won this match. \"We will think about the Uefa position and hopefully the teams ahead of us will keep on making mistakes.

      "bodyText": "A rueful smile crossed Gustavo Poyet's lips as he admitted that Ipswich may well pip Chelsea to the Champions League place that the west London club so dearly covet. How ironic it must seem to the Uruguayan that his club, with the highest wage bill in the land, may miss out on qualifying for Europe to George Burley's relative paupers. With a squad of superstars to keep content the least Claudio Ranieri must achieve this season is a place in the Uefa Cup but, while this win lifted his team to a season's-best fifth place, Chelsea did not display the form that will have Liverpool or Leeds - both of whom they must visit - let alone Ipswich quaking in their boots. Chelsea will be reminded of what they are missing this week as the European competitions return. Tomorrow, as Leeds and Arsenal are trying to make the Champions Cup semi-finals, Chelsea travel to Spurs aiming for their third consecutive away win, with victory vital if their late surge up the table is to be rewarded. \"We all dream a lot about the Champions League but I think it's a little bit difficult,\" said Poyet, whose mishit volley won this match. \"We will think about the Uefa position and hopefully the teams ahead of us will keep on making mistakes. You never know.\" Failure to make Europe may not just hit Chelsea in their overstretched pockets. Gianfranco Zola is considering a return to Italy in the summer and the prospect of either the Intertoto Cup or nothing at all may help make up his mind. Southampton's European ambition, alive when three consecutive victories lifted them to eighth, is now dead in the water after their three successive defeats since the departure of Glenn Hoddle. This performance, with James Beattie hitting a post with a header, suggested that the blues are lifting although they have not scored since Stuart Gray took over as caretaker. Dan Petrescu, who was devastated at Hoddle's leaving the Dell only two months after buying him from Bradford, said that he is unlikely to follow his old manager to White Hart Lane. \"We have to look to the future,\" the Romanian said. \"The manager said he was proud of our performance and things will turn for us if we play this way and keep working hard.\" Petrescu was warmly welcomed back but should have had the home fans cursing the day he left when he was put through clear on goal with 20 minutes remaining. His shot, though, was easily gathered by Carlo Cudicini. Petrescu and Poyet, whose friendship was described as being like \"husband and wife\" by Poyet, swapped shirts at the end. Chelsea will be hoping that this time next year Poyet's collection will have been bolstered by more souvenirs from the continent. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The action would be likely to hit schools in the autumn after ballots.</p> <p>Supporters of the executive urged the conference to seize an historic opportunity to put its long-time call for teacher union unity into practice.</p> <p>After the vote, billed as the most important of the conference, Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, predicted merger of the main classroom unions within eight years. The government had \"lost quite a significant weapon, the weapon of division\", he said.</p> <p>The joint motion was passed last week by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' conference and is set to be accepted on Wednesday by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers.

      "bodyText": "The leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday won a decisive victory over the left, paving the way for a historic campaign with three other unions in pursuit of a 35-hour week. The union's conference in Cardiff rejected by 124,404 to 80,024 an amendment by leftwing activists that would have, in effect, scuppered the joint motion agreed by the executives of the NUT and the other unions. The motion demands a full inquiry into pay and conditions and threatens industrial action to restrict teachers' working hours to 35 hours a week if the government resists. The action would be likely to hit schools in the autumn after ballots. Supporters of the executive urged the conference to seize an historic opportunity to put its long-time call for teacher union unity into practice. After the vote, billed as the most important of the conference, Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, predicted merger of the main classroom unions within eight years. The government had \"lost quite a significant weapon, the weapon of division\", he said. The joint motion was passed last week by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' conference and is set to be accepted on Wednesday by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers. The Welsh UCAC is likely to agree to it next month. But NUT leftwingers are furious that the executive suspended last week the joint action with the NASUWT over teacher shortages, where teachers refused to cover for long-term vacancies and staff sickness. Their amendment called for the action to be reinstated until the full independent inquiry is established. The NUT executive called the action off after the government promised a \"review\" of workload. The executive accepts that the review falls short of its demands but wants to negotiate over the terms. But Ian Murch, Bradford branch secretary, said: \"It's precisely because it [the motion] is a joint approach that it needs to be protected from the decision by the executive at the start of conference that threatens to undermine it. \"Instead of a new contract for teachers, we are in serious danger of grabbing defeat from the jaws of victory and ending up with nothing more than a bureaucracy circular.\" Kevin Courtney from Camden said he supported all the words in the joint motion but said the conference had not been allowed to debate the suspension. \"We are being asked to acquiesce in the executive calling off the action when the aims have not been met.\" For the executive, Jerry Glazier urged delegates: \"You have the opportunity to make history, to turn 'unity is strength' into effective action, not a cliched slogan.\" Hank Roberts, secretary of Professional Unity 2000, said: \"This motion represents the greatest opportunity for us in this union in the profession's history \u0085 Some people contrast professional unity with action.

Since Clay Regazzoni posted the team's maiden grand prix win at Silverstone in 1979, only one of the following 18 seasons, 1988, saw a Williams fail to win at least one race.</p> <p>Villeneuve's success marked the end of an era. It was to be the final victory for a Renault-engined Williams and instead Williams found itself having to pay a massive \u00a314m in lease fees to use fixed-specification \"customer\" Renault engines - badged as Mecachrome V10s. </p> <p>The moment the French company indicated their intention to quit, Williams and his technical director Patrick Head knew they needed to seek out an ambitious, high-technology partner, and as early as late 1996, Williams made their first approaches to BMW. </p> <p>The German company had been an active engine supplier during the era of turbo-charged engines in formula one during the early 80s, scoring their final victory of that era when Gerhard Berger won the Mexican grand prix at the wheel of a Benetton in 1986. Throughout the mid-90s, however, BMW had taken careful notice of the promotional benefits their rivals Mercedes-Benz were gaining from their association with the McLaren team, however, and gave the green light for a formula one engine programme at the end of 1997. </p> <p>On the driver front Williams also had a major clear-out. At the end of 1998 Villeneuve moved to the fledgling British American Racing team and Heinz-Harald Frentzen was dropped from the line-up, moving to Jordan. Villeneuve's sudden departure caused the most disruption to the team, who wanted to pair the experienced Canadian driver with the Colombian rising star Juan Pablo Montoya, who had been their test driver in 1998.</p> <p>However, once Villeneuve left, they decided that Montoya had insufficient experience and sub-contracted him to the Ganassi Indycar team for two seasons. Instead they recruited Ralf Schumacher and Alex Zanardi, who had been racing in the United States for three seasons and was never to feel at ease in the new generation of narrow-track formula one cars. He was bought out of the remaining two years of his contract for around \u00a33m.</p> <p>Determined to give Montoya a chance to return to formula one, Williams then signed the British rising star Jenson Button to partner Schumacher in the maiden season with the new BMW-engined cars in 1999 and Montoya replaced him at the start of this season. </p> <p>Williams did a remarkably effective job to finish a distant third in the 2000 world championship but it took the arrival of a brand new BMW V10 engine at the start of this year, plus a new tyre contract with Michelin, before the team could seriously aim for the big time once again. Before the start of the season the BMW executive Mario Theissen, who shares the role of competitions manager with the now retired Berger, said that BMW took the decision to build its new engine even before the start of last season and admitted: \"It is quite difficult to hit the edge of technology required by the F1 business, without going beyond it.\" Yesterday it seemed that they not only hit the target but scored a bull's-eye.</p>",

Villeneuve's success marked the end of an era. It was to be the final victory for a Renault-engined Williams and instead Williams found itself having to pay a massive \u00a314m in lease fees to use fixed-specification \"customer\" Renault engines - badged as Mecachrome V10s. The moment the French company indicated their intention to quit, Williams and his technical director Patrick Head knew they needed to seek out an ambitious, high-technology partner, and as early as late 1996, Williams made their first approaches to BMW. The German company had been an active engine supplier during the era of turbo-charged engines in formula one during the early 80s, scoring their final victory of that era when Gerhard Berger won the Mexican grand prix at the wheel of a Benetton in 1986. Throughout the mid-90s, however, BMW had taken careful notice of the promotional benefits their rivals Mercedes-Benz were gaining from their association with the McLaren team, however, and gave the green light for a formula one engine programme at the end of 1997. On the driver front Williams also had a major clear-out. At the end of 1998 Villeneuve moved to the fledgling British American Racing team and Heinz-Harald Frentzen was dropped from the line-up, moving to Jordan. Villeneuve's sudden departure caused the most disruption to the team, who wanted to pair the experienced Canadian driver with the Colombian rising star Juan Pablo Montoya, who had been their test driver in 1998. However, once Villeneuve left, they decided that Montoya had insufficient experience and sub-contracted him to the Ganassi Indycar team for two seasons. Instead they recruited Ralf Schumacher and Alex Zanardi, who had been racing in the United States for three seasons and was never to feel at ease in the new generation of narrow-track formula one cars. He was bought out of the remaining two years of his contract for around \u00a33m. Determined to give Montoya a chance to return to formula one, Williams then signed the British rising star Jenson Button to partner Schumacher in the maiden season with the new BMW-engined cars in 1999 and Montoya replaced him at the start of this season. Williams did a remarkably effective job to finish a distant third in the 2000 world championship but it took the arrival of a brand new BMW V10 engine at the start of this year, plus a new tyre contract with Michelin, before the team could seriously aim for the big time once again. Before the start of the season the BMW executive Mario Theissen, who shares the role of competitions manager with the now retired Berger, said that BMW took the decision to build its new engine even before the start of last season and admitted: \"It is quite difficult to hit the edge of technology required by the F1 business, without going beyond it.\" Yesterday it seemed that they not only hit the target but scored a bull's-eye.",

Those who have lived to tell of such things say they were left with a tiny amount of food and only filthy drinking water for a journey that lasts days.</p> <p>The story of the MV Etireno, with its cargo of desperate children, is almost routine in the harsh context of west Africa. So prevalent is child slavery there - the UN estimates there are 200,000 children working as slaves in the region - the boat's captain must be wondering what all the fuss is about.</p> <p>The dilapidated Nigerian ship has been plying the west coast for years, transporting its cargoes of children to labour in the sprawling cocoa plantations, or to work as servants, and de facto sex slaves, in the homes of the rich. The MV Etireno sailed as freely as any of the slave galleys that once plundered the region of humans for the New World.</p> <p>A fortnight ago, the vessel had no trouble loading its cargo of children in Benin. The ship had docked there many times before, one of a regular stream of such vessels. It is not clear exactly how many children were loaded this time, but they are likely to be very young and were destined to follow thousands of others to the plantations of Gabon. For once, though, the authorities in Gabon turned the ship away. Cameroon did the same thing, leaving the MV Etireno as a fugitive ship.</p> <p>Many come from Benin, where they are loaded in the port of Cotonou, a thriving centre of the slave trade in times gone by. Today, selling children is illegal, but not uncommon. Brokers scout the country persuading parents to part with their offspring for a few pounds in return for promises that they will get an education or send money home. Thousands of children, almost all less than 12 years old, end up being shipped to cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and Gabon.</p> <p>Four years ago, the Gabonese authorities found 400 youngsters waiting to be unloaded from a ship anchored in the harbour. But mostly the trade is left uninterrupted. There is a long history of child workers moving around west Africa. But according to Esther Guluma, the Benin representative of the UN's children's agency, Unicef, it has taken on more alarming aspects in recent years.</p> <p>\"We have to distinguish between traditional patterns of child labour, that were positive and not negative, which involved children being taken from rural areas to work in their relatives' homes in urban areas so they got an education and a better life,\" she said. \"But in the past few years, because of the deteriorating economic situation there has been a much bigger trade in children where they are very badly abused. Particularly, these large plantations need a lot of cheap labour, obedient labour and children are perfect for that. They work hard all day, you don't have to pay them very much and they don't complain.</p> <p>\"They are subjected to hard physical labour, they are uprooted from their families, they don't have any access to education. It has a real impact on their physical and mental development. Those trafficked as domestic servants, a lot of them are sexually exploited,\" said Ms Guluma.</p> <p>The trade is barely hidden, if at all, in many countries, which is why the captain of the MV Etireno is probably so mystified. There is an open market in children in Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, where women come to buy them to \"help around the house\". Child markets also exist in Lagos. In 1996, dozens of malnourished children were discovered being held in the Nigerian city by traffickers waiting for buyers.</p> <p>Girls from Benin and Togo are particularly in demand in Lagos where they are taken in to the houses of the relatively well off and forced to work for a pittance. But Nigeria also offers up its own, with a flourishing sex trade in young people to Europe and some wealthy Arab countries. Italy is a particularly favoured destination for the traffickers. Most children, though, are destined for the plantations. Even if they survive the long journey there, within a few years of slave labour many children are considered too exhausted or too old to be of any value and are discarded.</p> <p>According to Unicef, many end up joining the ranks of the poor. And many will never manage to find their way back home.</p>",

The story of the MV Etireno, with its cargo of desperate children, is almost routine in the harsh context of west Africa. So prevalent is child slavery there - the UN estimates there are 200,000 children working as slaves in the region - the boat's captain must be wondering what all the fuss is about. The dilapidated Nigerian ship has been plying the west coast for years, transporting its cargoes of children to labour in the sprawling cocoa plantations, or to work as servants, and de facto sex slaves, in the homes of the rich. The MV Etireno sailed as freely as any of the slave galleys that once plundered the region of humans for the New World. A fortnight ago, the vessel had no trouble loading its cargo of children in Benin. The ship had docked there many times before, one of a regular stream of such vessels. It is not clear exactly how many children were loaded this time, but they are likely to be very young and were destined to follow thousands of others to the plantations of Gabon. For once, though, the authorities in Gabon turned the ship away. Cameroon did the same thing, leaving the MV Etireno as a fugitive ship. Many come from Benin, where they are loaded in the port of Cotonou, a thriving centre of the slave trade in times gone by. Today, selling children is illegal, but not uncommon. Brokers scout the country persuading parents to part with their offspring for a few pounds in return for promises that they will get an education or send money home. Thousands of children, almost all less than 12 years old, end up being shipped to cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and Gabon. Four years ago, the Gabonese authorities found 400 youngsters waiting to be unloaded from a ship anchored in the harbour. But mostly the trade is left uninterrupted. There is a long history of child workers moving around west Africa. But according to Esther Guluma, the Benin representative of the UN's children's agency, Unicef, it has taken on more alarming aspects in recent years. \"We have to distinguish between traditional patterns of child labour, that were positive and not negative, which involved children being taken from rural areas to work in their relatives' homes in urban areas so they got an education and a better life,\" she said. \"But in the past few years, because of the deteriorating economic situation there has been a much bigger trade in children where they are very badly abused. Particularly, these large plantations need a lot of cheap labour, obedient labour and children are perfect for that. They work hard all day, you don't have to pay them very much and they don't complain. \"They are subjected to hard physical labour, they are uprooted from their families, they don't have any access to education. It has a real impact on their physical and mental development. Those trafficked as domestic servants, a lot of them are sexually exploited,\" said Ms Guluma. The trade is barely hidden, if at all, in many countries, which is why the captain of the MV Etireno is probably so mystified. There is an open market in children in Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, where women come to buy them to \"help around the house\". Child markets also exist in Lagos. In 1996, dozens of malnourished children were discovered being held in the Nigerian city by traffickers waiting for buyers. Girls from Benin and Togo are particularly in demand in Lagos where they are taken in to the houses of the relatively well off and forced to work for a pittance. But Nigeria also offers up its own, with a flourishing sex trade in young people to Europe and some wealthy Arab countries. Italy is a particularly favoured destination for the traffickers. Most children, though, are destined for the plantations. Even if they survive the long journey there, within a few years of slave labour many children are considered too exhausted or too old to be of any value and are discarded. According to Unicef, many end up joining the ranks of the poor. And many will never manage to find their way back home.",

Einstein's theory that God does not play dice with the universe is the subject of Wheel of Fortune, the BBC's first ever interactive radio play.

Wheel of Fortune is a tale of chance that mixes the atmosphere of a casino with quantum physics. Written by Nick Fisher, a BBC radio stalwart, it follows a professional gambler, a professor and a hacker as they attempt to defy both God and Einstein's theory to build a system that lets them win at roulette. Wheel of Fortune offers more than just the form of multi-user perspective you find on Sky Sports Active or the latest computer games. Users actually alter the story when they choose to switch, as the same characters say different things in different streams. </p> <p> \"What we are hoping is that even people who don't have access to the net will take the trouble to have two radios or use a radio with presets and switch between stations,\" explains director Marianne Nancarrow. This will allow radio listeners a similar level of interactivity to that of net users - except that on the airwaves, only two streams will be available at once. To combat this, Wheel of Fortune will be broadcast over two nights. On the first night the hacker's story will go out on R3 and the gambler's story on R4. The following night the gambler's story will be on R3, the professor's on R4. </p> <p> \"They will possibly, probably, hear scenes that they have heard before, but they won't hear them in the same order,\" explains Nancarrow. \"Also, because we are also going out on terrestrial radio we had to make all three configurations work as 30-minute plays. We realise there will always be a proportion of our audience who will not want to interact.\" </p> <p> The task of making an interactive radio drama has been a logistical nightmare, says Nancarrow. Scripting and editing is far more complex and expensive than three stand-alone plays. Editing alone takes three times as long, but continuity was the real headache. As Fisher says, \"Subatomic particles can be in two places at once, but characters can't.\" </p> <p> All of which explains why the play has taken four years to produce. \"It is longer than we would have liked,\" admits Nancarrow. \"It's partly because this was a big, unusual project and it was difficult to get a slot on more than one station. And when we started the technology was not yet in place.\" </p> <p> Initially scheduled for broadcast next week, Wheel of Fortune has now been put back until after the election. The online version will be archived for a month after transmission - rights issues prohibit a longer period. There will also be a random-access feature that chooses a route for the listener, should stream-hopping prove a little too interactive. </p> <p> The BBC says Wheel of Fortune represents its wider commitment to audio on the net. While a number of commercial and independent net radio stations have been steaming into the digital future, the BBC could be accused of lagging behind. BBC Online began simulcasting (simultaneously transmitting its on-air content online) its five main stations in November 1999. And in the past six months, all five stations have relaunched. With the exception of a few sporting events, all of the BBC's national radio is now online. But can we yet say that the corporation that did so much to shape terrestrial radio is playing as important a role in shaping net radio? </p> <p> Simon Nelson, the BBC's controller of new media, says that it is trying hard to catch up, and that Wheel of Fortune is the first in a raft of innovative projects from the corporation. \"The thing we understood at the beginning,\" he says, \"was that the amount and quality of content that passes out of our radio stations every day is staggering. If we can tap into that online, then we can effectively extend the life of audio broadcasting.\" </p> <p> So as well as simulcasting, the BBC is now offering an increasing amount of \"audio on demand\". Programmes such as The Archers and Woman's Hour are already online and the corporation has just soft-launched its music portal, bbc.co.uk/music. The site is due to launch fully this summer, although much of its content will be limited to 30-second clips. </p> <p> One of the ironies of internet radio is that it can often come with pictures. And this is an area that the BBC is keen to push. Last week it announced the launch of Cox TV, a series of webcasts featuring DJ Carl Cox as part of the new-look Radio 1 site. The majority of BBC DJs already have webcams in the studios and a number of outside broadcasts, such as the Leeds Love Parade, are part of the corporation's online remit. </p> <p>'It's important to understand that we are not just trying to make cheap telly,\" says Nelson. \"We are coming at this entirely from radio. But we have moved away from magazine-type sites and tried to give a more broadcast feel. These are small steps at the moment but it allows us to become a bit more responsive as broadcasters to what people want to hear. </p> <p> \"We have to keep in perspective that we are at the beginning, that analogue listening dwarfs online consumption. We've been given seed funding to represent our brands digitally on these new platforms and to learn as an organisation what audiences will value in the future.\" </p> <p> But the BBC will have to be quick. Last week Capital Interactive launched three stand-alone net radio stations. <a href=\"HTTP://www.ATK13.com\" target=\"_NEW\">ATK 13</a>, aimed at skaters and gamers; <a href=\"HTTP://www.Chyra.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Chyra</a>, aimed at office workers; and <a href=\"HTTP://www.Glisn.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Glisn</a>, an R&amp;B station. Capital claims that it has a head start on the BBC because it has fewer commercial restrictions. </p> <p> Capital is entering an already crowded marketplace that includes such operators as Virgin, Chrysalis and MTV. Also, UK audiences are not restricted to UK sites. US sites such as Spinner.com, Echo.net and Radio Sonicnet have built cult followings in the UK by offering DJ-free, highly personalised stations. To them the future of radio means offering the listener a bewildering array of choice. So could we see these innovations at the BBC? </p> <p> \"We don't see ourselves as in that game,\" admits Nelson. \"We are radio broadcasters and we'll leave the personalise-your-own-radio-station stuff to the commercial players.\" </p> <p> Rights are part of the problem: the US and most of Europe have far less restrictive licensing agreements than the UK. Furthermore, the online jukebox model offered by commercial players does not sit well with the BBC's commitment to educate and inform. Still, they are willing to take a chance on an ambitious radio drama in Wheel of Fortune. Will we see more of them? That's anyone's bet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lors des derni\u00e8res \u00e9lections municipales en France, la liste associative \u00ab Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s \u00bb a beaucoup fait parler d'elle. Initi\u00e9e par un groupe de musique toulousain, Zebda, elle a remport\u00e9 12,3 % des suffrages \u00e0 Toulouse. Fortement pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9e par les jeunes, elle a su convaincre gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des th\u00e8mes porteurs et une image jeune et dynamique, loin de celles des partis politiques traditionnels. Pour Laurent Visier, sociologue, cette autre fa\u00e7on - ludique et joyeuse - de faire de la politique s\u00e9duit les jeunes. \u00ab Ils r\u00e9alisent qu'ils peuvent s'amuser tout en \u00e9tant militants, \u00bb explique-t-il. \u00ab Ils sont attir\u00e9s par ces nouveaux hommes politiques qui leur ressemblent, et qui leur montrent qu'ils ont leur mot \u00e0 dire pour am\u00e9liorer leur vie au quotidien. Il sentent qu'ils ont un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer. \u00bb O\u00f9 en sont les jeunes Fran\u00e7ais avec la politique ? C'est ce que nous leur avons demand\u00e9 : Pour vous, que repr\u00e9sente la politique ? Olivier, 17 ans, lyc\u00e9en : Des promesses jamais tenues et des gens qui retournent leur veste une fois \u00e9lus. \u00c7a me saoule. Alice, 21 ans, \u00e9tudiante, adh\u00e9rente du parti politique Les Verts et de l'association des jeunes \u00e9colos alternatifs solidaires, Chiche : Quand j'ai int\u00e9gr\u00e9 Chiche, \u00e0 16 ans, je voulais prendre ma vie en main et changer le monde. Avec Chiche, je me sens la force d'agir, sans pour autant me prendre au s\u00e9rieux. Pour nous, la politique doit \u00eatre festive. Chrystelle, 24 ans, ch\u00f4meuse, inscrite sur la liste des Motiv\u00e9-e-s : Elle devrait repr\u00e9senter ceux qui ont quelque chose \u00e0 dire et les aider \u00e0 se sentir bien dans leur ville. Ce n'est pas le cas actuellement et \u00e7a me chagrine. Quels rapports entretiennent les jeunes avec la politique ? Olivier : Ils d\u00e9crochent, ne se sentent pas concern\u00e9s. Avec toutes les magouilles et dessous de table, ils n'ont plus confiance. Alice : Une fois \u00e9lus, les politiciens disparaissent. C'est de la politique spectacle. Les jeunes en ont marre de cette mascarade. Donc, ils ne votent plus. Les politiciens devraient montrer qu'ils sont pr\u00e9sents, qu'on peut leur parler, qu'ils sont proches de nous et qu'ils agissent pour notre bien \u00e0 tous. Chrystelle : Certains jeunes sont impliqu\u00e9s et veulent faire bouger les choses, d'autres s'en foutent car ils pensent que les politiques sont tous des pourris, et donc, baissent les bras. Comment int\u00e9resser les jeunes \u00e0 la vie politique du pays ? Olivier : Que les hommes politiques soient plus proches de nous, plus pr\u00e9sents sur le terrain, et arr\u00eatent de nous baratiner avec leur langue de bois. Alice : Rendre la politique int\u00e9ressante et agr\u00e9able. On peut rigoler tout en faisant de la politique. Or, les partis traditionnels ont une d\u00e9marche vieillote. C'est ultra-chiant. Il faut favoriser la participation de tous aux d\u00e9bats et montrer que chacun est important. Comme le font les associations de quartiers. Chrystelle : Leur dire qu'on peut faire la politique autrement et qu'on peut faire avancer les choses, que ce n'est pas trop tard. Ils veulent du concret. Ils ont des id\u00e9es mais ont besoin d'aide pour les mettre en \u00cfuvre. Il faut leur dire que tout le monde est important, quel que soit son statut social. La philosophie des Motiv\u00e9-e-s : faire bouger les gens en les impliquant dans la vie de la cit\u00e9 et en leur expliquant ce qu'est la politique. Comment expliquer le succ\u00e8s remport\u00e9 par la liste des Motiv\u00e9-e-s ? Alice : \u00c7a fait partie des nouvelles formes d'engagement politique qui me rassurent sur le devenir de la politique. Les jeunes toulousains ont montr\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et qu'ils souhaitaient participer \u00e0 la vie de leur ville. Chrystelle : Les gens se reconnaissent \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de notre mouvement et adh\u00e8rent \u00e0 nos id\u00e9es : que la politique se fasse avec tous, et que tous soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. On a montr\u00e9 que la politique fait partie de notre quotidien, dans notre ville. Notre but : expliquer comment fonctionne la municipalit\u00e9 et montrer que tout le monde peut s'investir et agir. Si on prend les probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 bras-le-corps, on peut, ensemble, les r\u00e9soudre, dans la joie et la bonne humeur.

      "trailText": "<p>Two editors depart, one swiftly and ignominiously, another at her leisure.</p>",
      "byline": "Roy Greenslade",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Two editors depart, one swiftly and ignominiously, another at her leisure. The Sunday Mirror's Colin Myler paid the price for publishing an article that led to the collapse of a high-profile trial and departed within days of his \"serious error of judgment\". </p> <p>The Independent on Sunday's Janet Street-Porter resigned because, despite what she says on this page, I believe she had no clear idea what to do next with her paper. </p> <p>Her editorship wasn't a disaster, but has been a disappointment. Myler's editorship was a disappointment that ended in disaster. </p> <p>For legal reasons, I cannot say too much about the reasons for his departure, but it would be unfair to him not to record that his decision to publish was taken with legal advice. It came from a lawyer considered to be an expert in the field who is highly regarded by his peers. </p> <p>But the buck has to stop on the editor's desk, and Trinity-Mirror had little alternative but to let Myler go. The board also took into account the fact that the Sunday Mirror was deluged with protests from readers who were outraged that their paper had been responsible for such a catastrophic turn of events. </p> <p>Perhaps Myler, an experienced tabloid hand, would not have had a much longer career at the Mirror anyway. The only reverse in the relentless downward sales drift was due to a marketing initiative, rather than editorial expertise. </p> <p>Now, with the imaginative appointment of Tina Weaver, deputy to Piers Morgan at the Mirror, there is an opportunity to take a fresh look at a title which has been lacking in lustre for far too long. The clear pointer in the statement by Mark Haysom, managing director of Trinity-Mirror's national papers, about a closer alignment between the daily and Sunday titles is an interesting prospect. </p> <p>I understand that it does not mean a merging of the two staffs, thank goodness, but will surely mean the kind of coherent branding, in typography, design and editorial content, that is evident at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. Doubtless, this could mean that feature pages and columnists currently appearing only in the daily Mirror will make an appearance in the Sunday title. </p> <p>Weaver, 32, won plaudits for her creation of M magazine, which she has been in the throes of revamping since it moved from Tuesdays to Saturdays. She is renowned for her hard work and her ability to get on with staff. </p> <p>She and Morgan will work closely together and they both have Sunday paper experience. When she returns from holiday to her new role she will probably take a couple of weeks before she outlines a new vision for the Sunday Mirror. Meanwhile, Myler's deputy, Fiona Wyton, will edit. </p> <p>Myler's future is altogether less certain. He may face contempt proceedings and, therefore, could be jailed. Trinity-Mirror may also face a heavy fine, given that the aborted trial cost some \u00a38m. </p> <p>The Myler affair has tended to overshadow the absorbing matter of the Independent on Sunday's prospects once Street-Porter leaves. </p> <p>The fact that she is staying on for a couple of months confirms that she and her editor-in-chief, Simon Kelner, have enjoyed a harmonious relationship. He chose her, stuck by her and now he must find a successor in whom he can have the same confidence. </p> <p>There are three strong internal candidates, as our panel below on the runners and riders, reveals. By refusing to rush into an appointment, Kelner is obviously hoping to flush out other hopefuls from outside, and I understand some people called him within hours of his announcement. An editorship, even of the lowest-selling Sunday title, is a powerful lure. </p> <p>The successful candidate will need to persuade more people that there is a good reason for buying the Independent on Sunday when its two main rivals are enjoying such success. </p> <p>The Sunday Times, a behemoth which has apparently unlimited resources, defies the slippage in the market while the Observer, under editor Roger Alton, has managed that most difficult of tricks: reversing decline and winning new readers. </p> <p>By contrast, the Sindy has been treading water and must find some flippers quickly if it isn't to drown. Kelner and his owners, Tony O'Reilly's Independent group, are obviously not going to panic. </p> <p>But if a celebrity editor failed to raise the paper's profile, they need to take a new direction.

      "bodyText": "Two editors depart, one swiftly and ignominiously, another at her leisure. The Sunday Mirror's Colin Myler paid the price for publishing an article that led to the collapse of a high-profile trial and departed within days of his \"serious error of judgment\". The Independent on Sunday's Janet Street-Porter resigned because, despite what she says on this page, I believe she had no clear idea what to do next with her paper. Her editorship wasn't a disaster, but has been a disappointment. Myler's editorship was a disappointment that ended in disaster. For legal reasons, I cannot say too much about the reasons for his departure, but it would be unfair to him not to record that his decision to publish was taken with legal advice. It came from a lawyer considered to be an expert in the field who is highly regarded by his peers. But the buck has to stop on the editor's desk, and Trinity-Mirror had little alternative but to let Myler go. The board also took into account the fact that the Sunday Mirror was deluged with protests from readers who were outraged that their paper had been responsible for such a catastrophic turn of events. Perhaps Myler, an experienced tabloid hand, would not have had a much longer career at the Mirror anyway. The only reverse in the relentless downward sales drift was due to a marketing initiative, rather than editorial expertise. Now, with the imaginative appointment of Tina Weaver, deputy to Piers Morgan at the Mirror, there is an opportunity to take a fresh look at a title which has been lacking in lustre for far too long. The clear pointer in the statement by Mark Haysom, managing director of Trinity-Mirror's national papers, about a closer alignment between the daily and Sunday titles is an interesting prospect. I understand that it does not mean a merging of the two staffs, thank goodness, but will surely mean the kind of coherent branding, in typography, design and editorial content, that is evident at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. Doubtless, this could mean that feature pages and columnists currently appearing only in the daily Mirror will make an appearance in the Sunday title. Weaver, 32, won plaudits for her creation of M magazine, which she has been in the throes of revamping since it moved from Tuesdays to Saturdays. She is renowned for her hard work and her ability to get on with staff. She and Morgan will work closely together and they both have Sunday paper experience. When she returns from holiday to her new role she will probably take a couple of weeks before she outlines a new vision for the Sunday Mirror. Meanwhile, Myler's deputy, Fiona Wyton, will edit. Myler's future is altogether less certain. He may face contempt proceedings and, therefore, could be jailed. Trinity-Mirror may also face a heavy fine, given that the aborted trial cost some \u00a38m. The Myler affair has tended to overshadow the absorbing matter of the Independent on Sunday's prospects once Street-Porter leaves. The fact that she is staying on for a couple of months confirms that she and her editor-in-chief, Simon Kelner, have enjoyed a harmonious relationship. He chose her, stuck by her and now he must find a successor in whom he can have the same confidence. There are three strong internal candidates, as our panel below on the runners and riders, reveals. By refusing to rush into an appointment, Kelner is obviously hoping to flush out other hopefuls from outside, and I understand some people called him within hours of his announcement. An editorship, even of the lowest-selling Sunday title, is a powerful lure. The successful candidate will need to persuade more people that there is a good reason for buying the Independent on Sunday when its two main rivals are enjoying such success. The Sunday Times, a behemoth which has apparently unlimited resources, defies the slippage in the market while the Observer, under editor Roger Alton, has managed that most difficult of tricks: reversing decline and winning new readers. By contrast, the Sindy has been treading water and must find some flippers quickly if it isn't to drown. Kelner and his owners, Tony O'Reilly's Independent group, are obviously not going to panic. But if a celebrity editor failed to raise the paper's profile, they need to take a new direction. I seem to recall that one of Street-Porter's predecessors, Rosie Boycott, attracted a big audience with her campaign to legalise cannabis. It may not have been popular with her bosses, but it was the kind of stunt that got the paper talked about. When a paper is bottom of its market, it has to take risks, has to be a maverick. In many ways, that was expected of Street-Porter who, instead, chose to play it straight, producing a paper that tended too often to be rather dull, if also professional. Perhaps our review of possible candidates will help Kelner make up his mind?",

But to crack 2% within five years is an astonishing achievement. Until recently, US research company Jupiter was predicting that online advertising would increase by 2005 to $16.5bn, which represents 8% of national ad spend, with 73% of advertisers claiming they would increase their online advertising within the next 12 months. </p> <p>Undoubtedly this figure is revised downwards on a daily basis. But let's look at the alternatives. On the same page of the FT which featured the internet overhauling cinema, there was a quaint report about the Telegraph shrinking by four cm. Telegraph CEO Dan Colson, the cheeky monkey, pays homage to earlier editors with shrinking papers - resurrecting the old joke that a smaller paper will make it easier for women to read owing to the shorter length of their arms. </p> <p>But in fact, it is a measure which reflects the imminent 11% rise in the price of newsprint. Couple this with the fact that the most exposed newspapers have seen a 40% drop in parts of their advertising business in the first quarter of 2001 and it is tempting to suggest that newspapers don't \"work\" either. </p> <p>But of course we know they do, because we have 200 years of experience which proves it. If the portable printed word had been invented two years ago, then given a blank piece of paper now, you wouldn't think in a million years that putting ink and pictures on it would make a viable business. </p> <p>Powerful, Primedia and the Standard do not prove that the internet is a bad place to be at the moment. They prove that publishing is a bad place to be at the moment. </p> <p>The business cycle has always been thus. Johann Gutenberg invented the amazing moveable type printing process in 1436, but later incurred such a huge cost in the process of developing the technology that he was eventually sued by his partner Mr Fust. Fust and his son-in-law made a fortune from printing. Gutenberg died in poverty. It is a lesson every dot.com disaster victim can take some heart from, though sadly allegories do not pay the wages.</p>",

Until recently, US research company Jupiter was predicting that online advertising would increase by 2005 to $16.5bn, which represents 8% of national ad spend, with 73% of advertisers claiming they would increase their online advertising within the next 12 months. Undoubtedly this figure is revised downwards on a daily basis. But let's look at the alternatives. On the same page of the FT which featured the internet overhauling cinema, there was a quaint report about the Telegraph shrinking by four cm. Telegraph CEO Dan Colson, the cheeky monkey, pays homage to earlier editors with shrinking papers - resurrecting the old joke that a smaller paper will make it easier for women to read owing to the shorter length of their arms. But in fact, it is a measure which reflects the imminent 11% rise in the price of newsprint. Couple this with the fact that the most exposed newspapers have seen a 40% drop in parts of their advertising business in the first quarter of 2001 and it is tempting to suggest that newspapers don't \"work\" either. But of course we know they do, because we have 200 years of experience which proves it. If the portable printed word had been invented two years ago, then given a blank piece of paper now, you wouldn't think in a million years that putting ink and pictures on it would make a viable business. Powerful, Primedia and the Standard do not prove that the internet is a bad place to be at the moment. They prove that publishing is a bad place to be at the moment. The business cycle has always been thus. Johann Gutenberg invented the amazing moveable type printing process in 1436, but later incurred such a huge cost in the process of developing the technology that he was eventually sued by his partner Mr Fust. Fust and his son-in-law made a fortune from printing. Gutenberg died in poverty. It is a lesson every dot.com disaster victim can take some heart from, though sadly allegories do not pay the wages.",

Yet Tony Blair's administration appears becalmed in the face of the coming crisis, having shown scant regard for the fact that the Provos have shown remarkable discipline for three years in the face of provocation from loyalist paramilitaries. There has been no reward for good behaviour, no understanding of the warnings about the difficulties of holding frustrated militants in check and deterring them from joining the Real IRA. The government played into the unionists' hands at the outset by making a fetish of removing arms from people who manifestly weren't using them. This single matter has bedevilled the whole process, preventing the Provos from being able to proselytise their political gambit as a success among the nationalist community. That's why the Real IRA, despite its backwardness and lack of politics, has a constituency. If the government really wishes to defeat the bombers it has, belatedly, to bolster the Provos and show that peace is the only \"real thing\" worth having. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<b> Mornings</b> <br> <p> The body in my bed is not my own. Curled around me is Noah whose journey through beaded curtains and uncarpeted stairs to find mother's warmth was heralded by the baby monitor. My dreams were not my own. Blaze called out - first for her daddy and then for an orange. My journeys through cold corridors and up unwelcoming treads to cover a child whose blankets have been kicked off, or to accompany a restless bladder to the toilet, render me blank as the canvas on which I intended to make my mark. </p> <p>My children know not to shout before Mummy has warmed herself into something human with her coffee. Three breakfasts, three bodies to dress, three sets of plans for the day. The illuminated clock on the wall inches slowly to a time when I can expect reinforcements. I hand over Blaze and try to get Noah to school before the lollipop man crosses to the other side of the zebra crossing - a sure sign that we will get a late note - again. </p> <p><b> Lunchtime</b><br> </p> <p> Slips by unnoticed. I struggle to finish a book, that somebody somewhere thinks would make a good film. During my \"difficult teens\", I read about worlds that were mysterious. Of fallen women and whores with hearts of gold. Then both birth and death seemed more tangible, whole communities had something to say about each character's destiny. It was not, as now, every woman for herself. </p> <p>Perhaps I should read one of the pile of polished but illiterate scripts sitting in unopened Fed-Ex packages marked \"extremely urgent\". Or I could fantasise about having found the perfect project [Kidron is a film director] and try to work out how to mother my children in some far-flung location while working 16-18 hours a day. </p> <p>The temptation to order a staircarpet is overwhelming. It would unite us during our restless nights. The texture should be comforting, no harsh man-made substances, it should be welcoming to the soft soles of little humans and their tired mothers. </p> <p><b> 3.30pm</b><br> </p> <p> A time ingrained on the heart of every mother. School is out. Rachel, the person who makes life possible, will pick up Noah. For me it is countdown time. Which of the many undone tasks should I tackle? </p> <p>I remember the accolades, the admiration, the flowers when Noah was born. Five months of prep. Four months of filming. [Kidron was directing To Wong Foo.] Male movie stars in dresses. More time spent discussing mascara and hemlines than in a lifetime of being a woman. Saved by hours from giving birth to a Midwestern baby, I arrived back in New York so pregnant, I never made it to my apartment. I was taken from JFK straight to hospital, my bags still circling unclaimed on the airport carousel. </p> <p>From my hospital bed I wrote pages of instructions to actors, the editor and the producer who were due to shoot in Times Square. My assistant arrived looking very young and frightened. The father of my child(ren) begged me to stop making a film and just have a bloody baby - after 36 hours and an unspeakable amount of pain, I did. I was too exhausted to know how much my world had changed. </p> <p><b> Teatime</b><br> </p> <p> As I walk in, I shout: \"Anybody I know here?\" and the children excitedly call their names. Noah turns to Blaze and says with the authority of the first-born: \"I told you she was coming.\" This is our routine; my place at the table is always laid, whether or not I am eating, and the menu and the day discussed with equal solemnity. Unfortunately teatime in London is when people in Los Angeles arrive in their offices and pick up the phone. </p> <p>The previous generation paved the way for my generation to gallop unheeded into jobs previously reserved for men. Being a woman was unhazardous; being a mother is quite a different matter. I am not always available. I no longer answer the phone on demand. The cute message from Noah on the machine makes inquirers doubt that I live at this number, and Blaze's penchant for answering the phone unaided to have rambling conversations makes even the most generous question their long-distance phone bill. </p> <p>Men in Hollywood take photographs of their offspring out of their pockets faster than any western hero ever drew a gun. Further questioning invariably reveals a wife who \"elected\" to stay at home, or that they see their children only at the weekend. It's a tough business ... for a mother. </p> <p><b> Bedtime</b><br> </p> <p> Is sometimes a victory - we survived another day. All tucked up, teeth brushed, books read, songs sung, experiences shared - I draw a breath. </p> <p>Sometimes bedtime brings the terrible sadness of another day on which we failed to bake a cake, paint a mural, count to a hundred without making a mistake. Sometimes bedtime is merely a break in my working day followed by a return to the office. Sometimes it's the beginning of my adult life - a longed-for trip to the theatre, dinner with friends. Sometimes I am defeated by the distracting, relentless day. </p> <p>I have been up for 15 hours and the muse has yet to appear. </p> <p><b> Weekends</b><br> </p> <p> The trick is to undertake as little as possible and do it slowly. Today my children are away. After a week of wondering if anything will get done, I am listless with my freedom. Creativity turns out to be a slave to routine and petulantly avoids the available gap, turning its back on me like an ignored lover. Sleep-deprived and fragile without the protective, demanding, distracting layer of my children, seduction is out of the question. </p> <p><b> Holidays</b><br> </p> <p> Unbelievably, they come around again. No sooner have you perfected your term-time childcare, and stolen every possible moment for your working life, than along comes another holiday. </p> <p>I can't help wondering about times past - in all the marching and agitating to create opportunities in the public world for women, who did we think was going to bring up the children? We expect and are expected to work. We travel further, do longer hours. Live in streets where our neighbours are strangers. We are a generation of individuals. Where are we to find the energy for our children, our collective future? I was fortunate enough to end up with work that I love. Was it greedy to have children, a stake in the future, genetic continuity, unconditional love given and received? </p> <p>I have been overwhelmed in Italy, France, the US, South America, the Middle East, my own home, at Christmas, Easter, August, spring/summer/autumn half-term. Overwhelmed by the need to entertain, the mountain of luggage, the heat, the cold, their desire to shit with no toilet in sight and no power to control themselves. I have been overwhelmed by having to carry sleeping children too far. Overwhelmed by buses that won't stop, cafes that won't serve, hotels that won't house, children. </p> <p>I want to feel heat on my skin, taste new foods, see first-hand the colours of my imagination. But I am confined to short adventures. Travel is no longer the periodic wanderings of an inquisitive mind. We have holidays to \"destinations\", at peak times and peak prices. Then just as I despair ... I turn around to see Blaze lying on the ground, indenting the earth with her small presence. \"That's Blazey,\" she points out as she stands to survey the indistinct shape. It is all the sensory help I need. Children have an eye for detail. That indentation is me, too. </p> <p><b> Work</b><br> </p> <p> Is more difficult, fractured, elusive.

Downing Street was clearly smoothing the way last night towards an announcement on vaccination, highlighting the significance of the publication of a report by the government's chief scientific adviser, Professor David King. His report said vaccinating cattle before they were moved from winter barns to spring pastures could reduce infection levels in hotspots like Cumbria and Devon. The need to move the cattle means a decision within the next 10 to 14 days, although the revelation that cold storage for vaccines is being prepared in Cumbria and that dozens of people have been trained to inject cattle has led to speculation that the decision has already been taken. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, was adamant yesterday that nothing had been decided and insisted ministers would consult fully with farmers first. \"Vaccination would only work as a strategy if everybody involved was committed to making it work.

      "body": "<p>A prime member of that most cherished, government-sanctified species, the American tourist with big bucks to spend, came back from the New Forest a few days ago. \"How was it?\" I asked. \"Disgusting,\" he said. \"You mean all the fear and disinfectant and funeral pyres?\" \"Oh no, that was all right. It was just that I'd forgotten how disgusting the weather is here.\"</p> <p>Pause there, among the frantic wittering. Up to 2m Brits - a record - jet out this Easter to the sun. They are somehow traitors. The Scottish tourism minister who went to Italy for his break is certainly knee-deep in haggis lasagne. Newspaper reporters - six from the Telegraph, alone - fan out across the nation eating in deserted restaurants and sleeping in lonely beds. Headlines talk of \"cash lifelines\" for \"devastated tourist industries\". We might be watching a particularly blood-boltered episode of ER.</p> <p>This pulsating dispatch comes to you from a natural front line, from Manchester. It is raining (as it has been raining for most of the past three months). It is raining in the Peak District and the Lake District. It is cold and it is miserable. I have bought a dozen pairs of socks in TK Maxx and eaten decently tender squid in an Italian restaurant. My foot and my mouth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in London, harassed ministers plot their responses to the sudden crisis of tourism. Mr Blair wants cash hand-outs, Mr Brown hates anyone but himself handing out \"his\" cash: Mr Meacher touts an ad hoc bank holiday in September for extra spending purposes, Mr Blair prefers a ninth regular break - maybe Trafalgar Day - every October. Nobody acknowledges the awful truth. Our weather is lousy, our footpaths - closed or open - are quagmires. None but the hardy few would, in any case, be venturing out through this frigid murk. We are in denial about our weather.</p> <p>How can that possibly be? We seem, from mindless habit, to talk of little else. Our forecasters, after the debacle of 1987, are the glummest warners in the world. And yet, as tourism supposedly catches pneumonia in early April, it is the sensible souls who pack their suntan lotion and head for Luton or Stansted who are dubbed deserters in this new battle of Britain. Bravery means remaining behind in the rain and watching John Prescott declare some stile fit to pass.</p> <p>Why on earth should anyone desert Los Angeles (17C and sunny) for this? Or Washington (23C)? Or New York (18C)? Why on earth stay here if you can get to Malaga, a sunny 20C? Diseased animals don't help, of course, any more than a holiday rail network back in the doldrums or the odd bomb from the Real IRA: but let's be real about the problem in turn. For all our ritual introspection, we delude ourselves about our own weather. We pretend - fatally - that it doesn't matter. We start the cricket season any second now and spend its first month in the pavilion. We have the opportunity to put a roof over Wimbledon's centre court and walk away.</p> <p>An extra bank holiday in October, as the leaves fall and the first storms of encroaching winter come, is pathetically more of the same. Bank holidays in Britain are anyway statistically doomed to frustration - damp opportunities for the burgeoning service industries (including online banks) to serve and the contracting manufacturing industries to go shopping. Perhaps we have so few (16th out of 17 western European countries) because they're such a desultory ordeal? Time to think again.</p> <p>European comparisons - as cited again last week by the Fabian Society - are meaningless in any case, for we do not have European weather. We aren't Spain or Greece or Italy (or even the mainland centre as the continent heats up). The Swedes and the Finns will look forward to more certain sun than we can. We can be cold and overcast any day of the year and when forecasters predict a glowing summer - as they did last month - the only evidence they cite under pressure is that we haven't had one since 1997.</p> <p>Tony Blair supposedly believes in joined-up thinking. Let's tie a few ends together. His education department is pondering a supposed revolution in the school year, four shorter terms interspersed by shorter holidays. This is an effort to match standards of European or American achievement. But both Europe and America - the true comparison - don't go that way at all. They have far shorter breaks at Easter and Christmas and pack up for 10 or 12 weeks in June. Their years are geared to reality. They follow the sun.</p> <p>We eschew reality. We truncate what passes, statistically, for our best chance of summer, and load in redundant weeks of chill dyspepsia after Christmas or through the sodden ides of Easter. And if hoteliers complain, we toss them a soggy October bun.</p> <p>It defies common sense. Think of Scotland's embattled tourism minister. He may be as patriotic as they come, but there was fog in Glasgow this weekend. Come June, though, come the finest weeks of Scottish weather, the schools will be full of exam takers and the factories whirring with industry. At the very best time to be out, the Scots will be in. Think more closely about the complaining restaurant owners and hotel keepers. They insist on opening for ludicrously long periods by European standards. Because we have no defined holiday season, they potter along growing grim through the sodden spring or appalling autumn, watching staff pick their nails.</p> <p>That, again, is not the European way, where most openings fit a defined span and staff from Paris or Madrid come down with their clients to open up. My local medieval village in Spain has 14 restaurants and no grocer's shop; none of the restaurants - even at 24C - dreams of opening through the week until June.</p> <p>What do we have to offer? History, culture, rather better food - and the shimmering chimera of the occasional perfect day. Those are our tourist bankers; they have little to do with footpaths and much more to do with the state of the American or Japanese economy. The moment, in a redundant lather of \"Backing Britain\", we lose track of that is the moment we become utterly dotty.</p> <p>One of the most fascinating books of the year so far is Queen Victoria and the Rise of the Riviera by Michael Nelson (IB Tauris, \u00a325).

      "bodyText": "A prime member of that most cherished, government-sanctified species, the American tourist with big bucks to spend, came back from the New Forest a few days ago. \"How was it?\" I asked. \"Disgusting,\" he said. \"You mean all the fear and disinfectant and funeral pyres?\" \"Oh no, that was all right. It was just that I'd forgotten how disgusting the weather is here.\" Pause there, among the frantic wittering. Up to 2m Brits - a record - jet out this Easter to the sun. They are somehow traitors. The Scottish tourism minister who went to Italy for his break is certainly knee-deep in haggis lasagne. Newspaper reporters - six from the Telegraph, alone - fan out across the nation eating in deserted restaurants and sleeping in lonely beds. Headlines talk of \"cash lifelines\" for \"devastated tourist industries\". We might be watching a particularly blood-boltered episode of ER. This pulsating dispatch comes to you from a natural front line, from Manchester. It is raining (as it has been raining for most of the past three months). It is raining in the Peak District and the Lake District. It is cold and it is miserable. I have bought a dozen pairs of socks in TK Maxx and eaten decently tender squid in an Italian restaurant. My foot and my mouth. Meanwhile, in London, harassed ministers plot their responses to the sudden crisis of tourism. Mr Blair wants cash hand-outs, Mr Brown hates anyone but himself handing out \"his\" cash: Mr Meacher touts an ad hoc bank holiday in September for extra spending purposes, Mr Blair prefers a ninth regular break - maybe Trafalgar Day - every October. Nobody acknowledges the awful truth. Our weather is lousy, our footpaths - closed or open - are quagmires. None but the hardy few would, in any case, be venturing out through this frigid murk. We are in denial about our weather. How can that possibly be? We seem, from mindless habit, to talk of little else. Our forecasters, after the debacle of 1987, are the glummest warners in the world. And yet, as tourism supposedly catches pneumonia in early April, it is the sensible souls who pack their suntan lotion and head for Luton or Stansted who are dubbed deserters in this new battle of Britain. Bravery means remaining behind in the rain and watching John Prescott declare some stile fit to pass. Why on earth should anyone desert Los Angeles (17C and sunny) for this? Or Washington (23C)? Or New York (18C)? Why on earth stay here if you can get to Malaga, a sunny 20C? Diseased animals don't help, of course, any more than a holiday rail network back in the doldrums or the odd bomb from the Real IRA: but let's be real about the problem in turn. For all our ritual introspection, we delude ourselves about our own weather. We pretend - fatally - that it doesn't matter. We start the cricket season any second now and spend its first month in the pavilion. We have the opportunity to put a roof over Wimbledon's centre court and walk away. An extra bank holiday in October, as the leaves fall and the first storms of encroaching winter come, is pathetically more of the same. Bank holidays in Britain are anyway statistically doomed to frustration - damp opportunities for the burgeoning service industries (including online banks) to serve and the contracting manufacturing industries to go shopping. Perhaps we have so few (16th out of 17 western European countries) because they're such a desultory ordeal? Time to think again. European comparisons - as cited again last week by the Fabian Society - are meaningless in any case, for we do not have European weather. We aren't Spain or Greece or Italy (or even the mainland centre as the continent heats up). The Swedes and the Finns will look forward to more certain sun than we can. We can be cold and overcast any day of the year and when forecasters predict a glowing summer - as they did last month - the only evidence they cite under pressure is that we haven't had one since 1997. Tony Blair supposedly believes in joined-up thinking. Let's tie a few ends together. His education department is pondering a supposed revolution in the school year, four shorter terms interspersed by shorter holidays. This is an effort to match standards of European or American achievement. But both Europe and America - the true comparison - don't go that way at all. They have far shorter breaks at Easter and Christmas and pack up for 10 or 12 weeks in June. Their years are geared to reality. They follow the sun. We eschew reality. We truncate what passes, statistically, for our best chance of summer, and load in redundant weeks of chill dyspepsia after Christmas or through the sodden ides of Easter. And if hoteliers complain, we toss them a soggy October bun. It defies common sense. Think of Scotland's embattled tourism minister. He may be as patriotic as they come, but there was fog in Glasgow this weekend. Come June, though, come the finest weeks of Scottish weather, the schools will be full of exam takers and the factories whirring with industry. At the very best time to be out, the Scots will be in. Think more closely about the complaining restaurant owners and hotel keepers. They insist on opening for ludicrously long periods by European standards. Because we have no defined holiday season, they potter along growing grim through the sodden spring or appalling autumn, watching staff pick their nails. That, again, is not the European way, where most openings fit a defined span and staff from Paris or Madrid come down with their clients to open up. My local medieval village in Spain has 14 restaurants and no grocer's shop; none of the restaurants - even at 24C - dreams of opening through the week until June. What do we have to offer? History, culture, rather better food - and the shimmering chimera of the occasional perfect day. Those are our tourist bankers; they have little to do with footpaths and much more to do with the state of the American or Japanese economy. The moment, in a redundant lather of \"Backing Britain\", we lose track of that is the moment we become utterly dotty. One of the most fascinating books of the year so far is Queen Victoria and the Rise of the Riviera by Michael Nelson (IB Tauris, \u00a325). It shows, in revealing detail, how the most British queen of an Indian empire - which she never visited - would slope off summer after summer to the warmth of Nice, and how the opinion leaders of her realm dutifully followed. Queen Vic helped invent international tourism, Britain's gift to the world: she was the trailblazer for Tony and Cherie. Perhaps she'd have fancied Antibes this benighted Easter. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

If, as expected, Mr Marshall does require more money for the company, he will have to approach Mr Winsor directly. Railtrack's accounts, due to be published next month, are expected to contain heavy losses this year of at least \u00a3500m, largely due to the Hatfield crash. Mr Winsor is not obliged to provide the any extra money unless he is convinced that Railtrack has presented a sufficiently strong argument. But if the regulator rejected Railtrack's approach, the company would be at crisis point. Either the government would have to intervene or Railtrack would be split up and sold off. Railtrack's problems are heightened by the fact that it has so far failed to find a new chairman, although it has been searching since the beginning of the year. Several candidates have rejected the job and no new candidate is immediately in sight. The appointment will lead to wholesale changes at board level, including the possible departure of Mr Marshall himself. The company is also facing lengthy litigation from the train operating companies who are to seek considerably more compensation than the \u00a3100m they have so far received as a result of Hatfield. Virgin and Great North Eastern are the two worst-hit operators. They have put up their fares by almost 10% and 3.3% respectively. Ministers are considering a change in legislation which would give them some access to private utilities, including Railtrack, so that the public's interests could be observed. The government has agreed with Railtrack the appointment of a \"public interest director\".",

      "body": "<p>It is now 18 days since Downing Street promised a decision within 48 hours on whether vaccination would be used to help curb the spread of foot and mouth. But Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, was still insisting yesterday no decision had been taken yet - and none would be until there had been full consultation with the farmers concerned. </p> <p>Even 18 days ago, vaccination looked the obvious extra weapon needed in the fight to stop the spread of the disease. By last Friday, the government admitted for the first time that its slaughter programme was not working fast enough to meet its targets. There were 540,000 animals waiting to be killed - and another 400,000 carcasses still awaiting disposal. Over the weekend, news emerged that a committee headed by the government's chief scientific adviser, Professor David King, had concluded that vaccinating cattle in hot spots like Cumbria and Devon could reduce infectivity levels.</p> <p>About 200,000 cattle in hot-spot areas are due to be moved from winter barns to spring pastures. One lesson from the last epidemic in 1967 was that the risk of infection is twice as high once cattle are moved outside. Vaccination would not only protect the cattle but also help prevent the spread of the disease. </p> <p>Division within the ranks of the farming community is the main reason that ministers have delayed. Some farmers believe vaccination will prolong the epidemic as well as delay the restoration of meat exports. Ministers were right to seek a consensus, but have dallied too long already. </p> <p>Moreover, vaccination should not be restricted to cattle but extended to rare breeds of sheep, such as Herdwick in the Lake District, which face being wiped out by the disease. If the sheep go, so will the landscape of the Lakes, with the current picturesque upland pastures replaced by coarse scrub.</p> <p>A second decision facing ministers this week is even easier. Landfill site companies are seeking \"unlimited indemnity\" from the government before accepting dead cattle for burial. They fear burial could lead to the infective prion, which causes BSE, escaping and spreading CJD, the human form of BSE. They should be given immunity. The government's advisory committee on BSE estimates only 90 out of the 7m cows in the national herd are infected. Almost all are aged over five. There is clearly a risk, but a small one.

      "body": "<p>Four years is a long time to produce a half-hour radio drama. Unless, that is, that drama has billions of permutations. </p> <p>Einstein's theory that God does not play dice with the universe is the subject of Wheel of Fortune, the BBC's first ever interactive radio play. Due to be broadcast on the internet and on Radio 3 and 4 simultaneously, it offers listeners the chance to navigate their way through a 30-minute experience that, amazingly, offers 94 billion different narrative routes. </p> <p>Achieving such a staggering number of choices isn't as complicated as it sounds. The producers have developed three separate but overlapping plays. Each has been cut down into 23 one-minute chunks with a narrative \"junction\" at the end. At each junction, the listener is invited either to continue listening to that stream, or to switch to one of the other two. Hence, mathematically, the 94 billion options - three to the power of 23. </p> <p>Wheel of Fortune is a tale of chance that mixes the atmosphere of a casino with quantum physics. Written by Nick Fisher, a BBC radio stalwart, it follows a professional gambler, a professor and a hacker as they attempt to defy both God and Einstein's theory to build a system that lets them win at roulette.</p> <p>Wheel of Fortune offers more than just the form of multi-user perspective you find on Sky Sports Active or the latest computer games.

      "bodyText": "Four years is a long time to produce a half-hour radio drama. Unless, that is, that drama has billions of permutations. Einstein's theory that God does not play dice with the universe is the subject of Wheel of Fortune, the BBC's first ever interactive radio play. Due to be broadcast on the internet and on Radio 3 and 4 simultaneously, it offers listeners the chance to navigate their way through a 30-minute experience that, amazingly, offers 94 billion different narrative routes. Achieving such a staggering number of choices isn't as complicated as it sounds. The producers have developed three separate but overlapping plays. Each has been cut down into 23 one-minute chunks with a narrative \"junction\" at the end. At each junction, the listener is invited either to continue listening to that stream, or to switch to one of the other two. Hence, mathematically, the 94 billion options - three to the power of 23. Wheel of Fortune is a tale of chance that mixes the atmosphere of a casino with quantum physics. Written by Nick Fisher, a BBC radio stalwart, it follows a professional gambler, a professor and a hacker as they attempt to defy both God and Einstein's theory to build a system that lets them win at roulette. Wheel of Fortune offers more than just the form of multi-user perspective you find on Sky Sports Active or the latest computer games. Users actually alter the story when they choose to switch, as the same characters say different things in different streams. \"What we are hoping is that even people who don't have access to the net will take the trouble to have two radios or use a radio with presets and switch between stations,\" explains director Marianne Nancarrow.

He said the attack was in response to Hizbullah attacks in recent months, and most recently last week, when an Israeli soldier was killed in a tank hit by rocketfire near a disputed border zone at the southern Chebaa Farms area. \"The Israeli Defence Forces will not tolerate the continuation of the terrorist policy conducted by Hizbullah operating under the patronage of the Syrian government,\" the army said in a statement. \"The IDF will use all the means at its disposal to ensure the safety of the residents of the northern border and its soldiers.\" At least three bomb impacts were heard shortly after midnight in the region, according to witnesses and police. Israeli jets roared past the mountains on several runs as tracers from ground anti-aircraft were fired at the warplanes. The region is dotted with Syrian army troop positions that include radar stations, tanks and armoured personnel carriers. The strike was the first by Israeli warplanes on targets deep inside Lebanon since Israeli forces withdrew from southern Lebanon last May. It was also the first time that Syrian troops were targetted by the Israeli army since 1996, when Israeli helicopter gunships blasted Syrian army positions near Beirut airport during a bombing campaign against Lebanon. Syria, which has 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power broker there, maintains bases and checkpoints for its forces along the crucial highway in mountains. The area is strategic because it overlooks much of the Mediterranean coastline and the eastern Bekaa Valley, all the way to the mountain range that forms the border between Lebanon and Syria. On Saturday, Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said if Hizbullah attacks continued \"we will be forced to take the necessary action and exercise self defence and strike at Hizbullah targets\". The Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, late Saturday described the Hizbullah attack as \"a sick provocation that has no explanation.\" He said his government sent \"a clear message to the governments of Lebanon and Syria that we see them as responsible for what happened.\" On Sunday, a special UN envoy said the Hizbullah attack in the disputed Chebaa Farms border zone in southern Lebanon violated the UN-drawn line between Lebanon and Israel. Staffan De Mistura met Sunday with the prime minister, Rafik Hariri, to relay UN concerns about the Hizbullah attack. The Chebaa Farms area was captured by Israel when it overran the Syrian Golan Heights in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Its forces did not withdraw from the area when it ended its 18-year occupation of south Lebanon in May.",

      "body": "<p>On April 11 2000, I sat in a darkened auditorium in Kensington Town Hall and watched the tanned, sockless, well-coiffed publisher of the American magazine I wrote for bound on to stage to the applause of an audience of European internet cognoscenti. </p> <p>Here was John Battelle, former managing editor of Wired, founder of the ill-fated Wired UK, returning to Britain to announce plans for a European edition of his latest project, the Industry Standard. </p> <p>Achieving mind-boggling financial success in America, Battelle and his backers, trade publishers IDG, were thinking then the way all US internet companies were thinking: \"We did America, now we do Europe.\" Somewhere on the horizon were plans for \"doing Latin America\", and then \"doing Asia\". </p> <p>A year later to the day, the booze-sodden staff of the Industry Standard Europe rang me up from the pub (I had left four months previously). The game was over. The doors were shutting. Having raised $30m to expand internationally in 2000, one year was all it took to convince management that \"doing\" the rest of the world just wasn't going to pay. </p> <p>The rhetoric of the Industry Standard has always claimed that this trade magazine wasn't a trade magazine at all. It was a business magazine, paying top-dollar for superior journalists to produce hard-hitting investigative pieces about the new media revolution. Editor-in-chief Jonathan Weber spoke often about the inevitable bursting of the internet bubble, telling staffers that the decline would be just as invigorating to write about as the inexorable excesses of 1999 and early 2000. </p> <p>But trade magazines, after all, are dependent on the industries they cover. The companies you cover are the companies that buy ads, and the companies that subscribe. No one in the management of the Industry Standard can have failed to recognise this. With the first crashes of Nasdaq in March and April 2000, followed by the ominous crash of the well-funded Boo.com in May, the nascent internet industry that had transformed the Industry Standard from a 48-page twice-monthly news mag azine to a 400-page weekly selling $2m in ad space every issue couldn't continue to support such a publishing juggernaut. </p> <p>After the sparkling success of those early days, observers are looking everywhere for an explanation of why, last Wednesday, IDG and Standard Media International decided to pull the plug on the six-month-old European edition. Its editor-in-chief Jim Ledbetter said news-stand sales were rising and that in terms of recruitment advertising it was already outselling its homegrown competition, New Media Age. Halting publication now is an uncomfortable echo of Battelle's last European venture, Wired UK, whose editors are still baffled by its closure - after 18 months of losses, the magazine was just starting to make money. </p> <p>One explanation comes from the publisher of a competing publication, who is said to have crowed after hearing the news: \"I could have told them the market was too small months ago!\" To European observers, and particularly British ones, the money that the Industry Standard laid out on its staff and its parties was legendary. There was doubt from all sides, after our lavish launch party at the Coq d'Argent in October, as to whether the relatively small market for news about the internet industry could ever profitably fund a weekly magazine with a staff of 65 that had a taste for expense accounts. </p> <p>The Standard's notoriously high salaries didn't go unnoticed here. Last week's press coverage of the Standard Europe's demise was written mostly by journalists who at one time or another during the hiring process lunched at the Standard's expense. Those who took the bait and leapt now join the ranks of other journalists who were lured into new media by high-flying American com panies such as TheStreet.com and the Red Herring who came to Europe with money to burn, burned it, and then headed home. </p> <p>International expansion started at the Industry Standard because of a push in the US to bring the company to the stock market in an initial public offering. No one, not even IDG, had expected the magazine to be as financially successful as it was, but as the coffers filled, plans to float the company took over. International expansion was key to a float. </p> <p>In June 1999, I met for the first time with Michael Parsons, then second-in-command on the American publication. A native Briton who had spent five years in California, he was keen to begin placing reporters in overseas posts, and I was his first. I was then a reporter for Wired News, the daily news site started by Wired magazine, and was planning to move to the UK anyway. Parsons suggested I join the Standard, and from August on, the \"International\" in Standard Media International consisted of an ISDN line into the front room of a two-up, two-down in Edgware, London. </p> <p>On my second day here, still strung out from jet-lag and the exhaustion of trying to comprehend British Telecom's refusal to give me high-speed internet access no matter how much money we offered them, I attended my first First Tuesday at Home House in Portman Square. </p> <p>In the next six months, Europe went internet mad and the Industry Standard, that bible of Silicon Valley, was suddenly the most desirable contact possible. </p> <p>Stranger still was the influx of Americans keen (not unlike myself) to stake a claim in the goldrush territory of Britain and continental Europe. Those that hadn't managed to distinguish themselves in the US flocked here where their American-ness and Silicon Valley experience set them apart from the crowd. US internet and media companies started putting international expansion at the top of their list, and London was the place to begin. </p> <p>The only drawback was the strange reluctance of the locals to be colonised. No sooner had the Americans arrived en masse than the Europeans were fighting back, accusing us of failing to understand the turf. Researching a story on this reluctance, I interviewed the head of Disney's international internet expansion. After he downplayed native resistance to the American media presence, I asked him where Disney would be expanding first as it \"did Europe\". He said Britain, since they had rejected France as too difficult and \"Scandinavia was just too small a country\". \"You know Scandinavia's not a country, right?\" I asked. \"What?\" he replied. </p> <p>But it was six more months, and the goldrush had been and gone, before Standard Media International sent Michael Parsons back to his homeland to start building an edition of the Industry Standard in Europe. He arrived in May, hiring began in earnest in June and July, and preparations were made to launch in October of 2000. Jim Ledbetter, a star prize of the Industry Standard in the US who had spent eight years at the Village Voice, arrived to edit it. Staff were hired in five countries, and no expense was spared to poach the very best Europe had to offer. </p> <p>Already disgruntled and cynical about the internet industry and my job, even I was impressed with the speed with which Ledbetter and Parsons assembled their star team. The magazine launched on time and was strikingly professional for a first issue. Morale was high, and at a small staff dinner before launch, publisher Neil Thackray tearfully told the assembled staff it was the most exciting thing he'd done in his professional career. Hankies came out again last week, when Thackray made an equally tearful announcement to the staff that, unable to find a buyer, the magazine would be closed. </p> <p>The writing was indeed on the wall for some time. Layoffs had been made in the US. The Red Herring's international editor had departed for the far east to work for the Wall Street Journal, and two of its three London staffers had been sacked. Business 2.0, another competitor, was publicly on the block, and over the weekend before closure, the Industry Standard Europe admitted it too was seeking a buyer. </p> <p>Although a skeleton staff will remain in London, the magazine will cease publication. Opinions on its success or failure as an editorial organ vary, but in the final analysis market forces have had the last word. To my mind, the excesses of 1999 and 2000 were the exception and not the rule, and to base a media business on an exceptional market state leaves little question as to the outcome. However, as one staffer said in the wee hours of Wednesday's pub crawl, as the gallows humour died out: it was a wild ride, and that's worth more than security any day. </p> <p>Polly Sprenger, former London correspondent of the Industry Standard and senior editor of the Industry Standard Europe, is now a trainee cabinetmaker.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On April 11 2000, I sat in a darkened auditorium in Kensington Town Hall and watched the tanned, sockless, well-coiffed publisher of the American magazine I wrote for bound on to stage to the applause of an audience of European internet cognoscenti. Here was John Battelle, former managing editor of Wired, founder of the ill-fated Wired UK, returning to Britain to announce plans for a European edition of his latest project, the Industry Standard. Achieving mind-boggling financial success in America, Battelle and his backers, trade publishers IDG, were thinking then the way all US internet companies were thinking: \"We did America, now we do Europe.\" Somewhere on the horizon were plans for \"doing Latin America\", and then \"doing Asia\". A year later to the day, the booze-sodden staff of the Industry Standard Europe rang me up from the pub (I had left four months previously). The game was over. The doors were shutting. Having raised $30m to expand internationally in 2000, one year was all it took to convince management that \"doing\" the rest of the world just wasn't going to pay. The rhetoric of the Industry Standard has always claimed that this trade magazine wasn't a trade magazine at all. It was a business magazine, paying top-dollar for superior journalists to produce hard-hitting investigative pieces about the new media revolution. Editor-in-chief Jonathan Weber spoke often about the inevitable bursting of the internet bubble, telling staffers that the decline would be just as invigorating to write about as the inexorable excesses of 1999 and early 2000. But trade magazines, after all, are dependent on the industries they cover. The companies you cover are the companies that buy ads, and the companies that subscribe. No one in the management of the Industry Standard can have failed to recognise this. With the first crashes of Nasdaq in March and April 2000, followed by the ominous crash of the well-funded Boo.com in May, the nascent internet industry that had transformed the Industry Standard from a 48-page twice-monthly news mag azine to a 400-page weekly selling $2m in ad space every issue couldn't continue to support such a publishing juggernaut. After the sparkling success of those early days, observers are looking everywhere for an explanation of why, last Wednesday, IDG and Standard Media International decided to pull the plug on the six-month-old European edition. Its editor-in-chief Jim Ledbetter said news-stand sales were rising and that in terms of recruitment advertising it was already outselling its homegrown competition, New Media Age. Halting publication now is an uncomfortable echo of Battelle's last European venture, Wired UK, whose editors are still baffled by its closure - after 18 months of losses, the magazine was just starting to make money. One explanation comes from the publisher of a competing publication, who is said to have crowed after hearing the news: \"I could have told them the market was too small months ago!\" To European observers, and particularly British ones, the money that the Industry Standard laid out on its staff and its parties was legendary. There was doubt from all sides, after our lavish launch party at the Coq d'Argent in October, as to whether the relatively small market for news about the internet industry could ever profitably fund a weekly magazine with a staff of 65 that had a taste for expense accounts. The Standard's notoriously high salaries didn't go unnoticed here. Last week's press coverage of the Standard Europe's demise was written mostly by journalists who at one time or another during the hiring process lunched at the Standard's expense. Those who took the bait and leapt now join the ranks of other journalists who were lured into new media by high-flying American com panies such as TheStreet.com and the Red Herring who came to Europe with money to burn, burned it, and then headed home. International expansion started at the Industry Standard because of a push in the US to bring the company to the stock market in an initial public offering. No one, not even IDG, had expected the magazine to be as financially successful as it was, but as the coffers filled, plans to float the company took over. International expansion was key to a float. In June 1999, I met for the first time with Michael Parsons, then second-in-command on the American publication. A native Briton who had spent five years in California, he was keen to begin placing reporters in overseas posts, and I was his first. I was then a reporter for Wired News, the daily news site started by Wired magazine, and was planning to move to the UK anyway. Parsons suggested I join the Standard, and from August on, the \"International\" in Standard Media International consisted of an ISDN line into the front room of a two-up, two-down in Edgware, London. On my second day here, still strung out from jet-lag and the exhaustion of trying to comprehend British Telecom's refusal to give me high-speed internet access no matter how much money we offered them, I attended my first First Tuesday at Home House in Portman Square. In the next six months, Europe went internet mad and the Industry Standard, that bible of Silicon Valley, was suddenly the most desirable contact possible. Stranger still was the influx of Americans keen (not unlike myself) to stake a claim in the goldrush territory of Britain and continental Europe. Those that hadn't managed to distinguish themselves in the US flocked here where their American-ness and Silicon Valley experience set them apart from the crowd. US internet and media companies started putting international expansion at the top of their list, and London was the place to begin. The only drawback was the strange reluctance of the locals to be colonised. No sooner had the Americans arrived en masse than the Europeans were fighting back, accusing us of failing to understand the turf. Researching a story on this reluctance, I interviewed the head of Disney's international internet expansion. After he downplayed native resistance to the American media presence, I asked him where Disney would be expanding first as it \"did Europe\". He said Britain, since they had rejected France as too difficult and \"Scandinavia was just too small a country\". \"You know Scandinavia's not a country, right?\" I asked. \"What?\" he replied. But it was six more months, and the goldrush had been and gone, before Standard Media International sent Michael Parsons back to his homeland to start building an edition of the Industry Standard in Europe. He arrived in May, hiring began in earnest in June and July, and preparations were made to launch in October of 2000. Jim Ledbetter, a star prize of the Industry Standard in the US who had spent eight years at the Village Voice, arrived to edit it. Staff were hired in five countries, and no expense was spared to poach the very best Europe had to offer. Already disgruntled and cynical about the internet industry and my job, even I was impressed with the speed with which Ledbetter and Parsons assembled their star team. The magazine launched on time and was strikingly professional for a first issue. Morale was high, and at a small staff dinner before launch, publisher Neil Thackray tearfully told the assembled staff it was the most exciting thing he'd done in his professional career. Hankies came out again last week, when Thackray made an equally tearful announcement to the staff that, unable to find a buyer, the magazine would be closed. The writing was indeed on the wall for some time. Layoffs had been made in the US. The Red Herring's international editor had departed for the far east to work for the Wall Street Journal, and two of its three London staffers had been sacked. Business 2.0, another competitor, was publicly on the block, and over the weekend before closure, the Industry Standard Europe admitted it too was seeking a buyer. Although a skeleton staff will remain in London, the magazine will cease publication. Opinions on its success or failure as an editorial organ vary, but in the final analysis market forces have had the last word. To my mind, the excesses of 1999 and 2000 were the exception and not the rule, and to base a media business on an exceptional market state leaves little question as to the outcome. However, as one staffer said in the wee hours of Wednesday's pub crawl, as the gallows humour died out: it was a wild ride, and that's worth more than security any day. Polly Sprenger, former London correspondent of the Industry Standard and senior editor of the Industry Standard Europe, is now a trainee cabinetmaker.",

It's reduced. I got a vat of it.\" </p> <p>In recent years, there have been lots of vats of Proustian Rush slopping round. There was Alain de Botton's How Proust Can Change Your Life. There was a memoir entitled The Year of Reading Proust (what a great idea: don't read the 3,000 pages and six volumes that make up A La Recherche du Temps Perdu itself - instead read a book about someone else reading it). We've had Edmund White's queer life of the author, two massive biographies, and more academic Proustiana than you can wave a Belle Epoque cane at. </p> <p>Then there have been the films: Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff produced a polite costume drama of Swann in Love in the early 1980s, in which it seemed to take Jeremy Irons an hour and a half to pin an orchid on Ornella Muti's seething bosom. A couple of years ago, Chilean workaholic Raul Ruiz adapted the last volume of A La Recherche, a film entitled Le Temps Retrouv\u00e9. Harold Pinter's screenplay of the whole novel has not yet been filmed, but the National Theatre has offered a condensed version of it. </p> <p>So why, after all these Proustian rushes, should we be interested in Chantal Akerman's film The Captive, an adaptation of one of the books from A La Recherche? The first reason is that La Prisonni\u00e8re (on which The Captive is based) is the book that can most easily be lifted from Proust's great novel. Indeed, the story of Marcel's obsession with Albertine lends itself admirably to a cinematic treatment: here is a self-contained story about a man obsessing about a woman to the extent that he cannot allow her out of his sight. And when she is with him he only worries about what she will do when she leaves. </p> <p>The second reason is that Akerman's austere but excellent film removes all Proust's softening diversions. Gone are the reflections on art and memory, as well as a 100-page musical soir\u00e9e. This is Proust without the costume drama, without wit or social comedy, but with his vision of love as possession accentuated. </p> <p>Akerman, 50, a Belgian director and writer with a reputation for taking risks, is well suited to adapting the book. She has regularly addressed obsession and rootlessness in the 36 films that she has made since her 1968 debut, Blow Up My Town. </p> <p>But why is the captive of the title a woman (the film is called La Captive in French)? Surely Marcel (renamed Simon in Akerman's adaptation) is trapped by the obsession more than the female character. She seems to have another life about which Simon can only crazily fanta sise. Is she a lesbian on the sly? Where does she go when she leaves? </p> <p>For Akerman the reason is plain: \"She is the captive because she has no identity outside Simon's obsession.\" The woman's \"autonomous\" life exists only in his fantasies. Think of Violetta in La Traviata, Mimi in La Boh\u00e8me, Manon Lescaut. These are not individuals so much as objects of male fantasy. </p> <p>Akerman is clearly alive to this long line of non-beings. Like them, Ariane (as Albertine has been renamed) is unpredictable, enigmatic. If Ariane was merely a cocotte we would understand her but - like Simon - we don't. It recalls what choreographer Kenneth MacMillan wrote of the subject of his great ballet, Manon: \"One of the things that intrigues me the most is that there seems to be no logic to Manon's behaviour.\" </p> <p>While Manon is an enigma wrapped in a tutu, Ariane is an enigma wrapped in Simon's obsessions. \"Ariane cannot be captured,\" says Akerman. \"She cannot be possessed.\" Not by Simon, nor by those watching the film. The film presents us with an endless deferral that would appeal to Jacques Derrida. We can never know one another, never possess another as we want. This vision of love is tragic - Ariane is a captive but she cannot be captured. </p> <p>In one scene, Simon invites her to his bed, but he can only rub up against her to orgasm through his pristine pyjamas. His obsession is ultimately narcissistic, masturbatory. </p> <p>Never considered in Akerman's film, or in A La Recherche, is that love must grant the beloved autonomy if it is to survive. Simon is played by the beautiful Stanislas Merhar. In one particularly resonant scene, he pursues Ariane (played by the wonderful Sylvie Testud) in his car from the Place Vendme in Paris. It's the most languorous car chase in film history - this is not the French Connection - and recalls James Stewart's pursuit of the woman he believes to be Carlotta in Vertigo. But Akerman denies the debt to Vertigo, and argues that Hitchcock's concerns are very different from hers: \"Hitchcock's film is fetishistic; mine is about obsession.\" But the distinction is surely not as clear as she suggests: Stewart's fetishism (dressing his doll-like surrogate in the clothes and wigs that remind him of the woman he never perfectly possessed) comes from an obsession with something he can't recover. Simon's obsession with Ariane is for a woman he can never have. </p> <p>The film starts with Simon watching an old home video of some girls, among them Ariane, playing in the sea off the Normandy coast. Like Simon, we are going back to the primal scene of his obsession, revisiting the moment in which he first became captivated by her. </p> <p>Or did he really become captivated? The first word that Simon says in the film, while watching the video, is \"Je\" (\"I\"). This suggests to us that he does not know this woman, and never will, because he is unwittingly bent on misinterpreting her. His tragedy starts with the first syllable he utters. </p> <p>\u0095 The Captive is out on April 27.</p>",

His obsession is ultimately narcissistic, masturbatory. Never considered in Akerman's film, or in A La Recherche, is that love must grant the beloved autonomy if it is to survive. Simon is played by the beautiful Stanislas Merhar. In one particularly resonant scene, he pursues Ariane (played by the wonderful Sylvie Testud) in his car from the Place Vendme in Paris. It's the most languorous car chase in film history - this is not the French Connection - and recalls James Stewart's pursuit of the woman he believes to be Carlotta in Vertigo. But Akerman denies the debt to Vertigo, and argues that Hitchcock's concerns are very different from hers: \"Hitchcock's film is fetishistic; mine is about obsession.\" But the distinction is surely not as clear as she suggests: Stewart's fetishism (dressing his doll-like surrogate in the clothes and wigs that remind him of the woman he never perfectly possessed) comes from an obsession with something he can't recover. Simon's obsession with Ariane is for a woman he can never have. The film starts with Simon watching an old home video of some girls, among them Ariane, playing in the sea off the Normandy coast. Like Simon, we are going back to the primal scene of his obsession, revisiting the moment in which he first became captivated by her. Or did he really become captivated? The first word that Simon says in the film, while watching the video, is \"Je\" (\"I\"). This suggests to us that he does not know this woman, and never will, because he is unwittingly bent on misinterpreting her. His tragedy starts with the first syllable he utters. \u0095 The Captive is out on April 27.",

      "body": "<p>Just over two years ago, I answered the phone to Simon Kelner, editor-in-chief of the Independent. He said he'd had an idea, and could he pop round and talk it over with me. He suggested breakfast. To this day, he still tells people it involved a cup of coffee and nothing else. I was probably on one of my hopeless weight control phases. </p> <p>He asked me if I'd like to edit the Independent on Sunday - I was astonished. We'd started talking a few months before about the possibility of me contributing to the Independent papers regularly, but I could never work out what kind of format would work, and having written columns for quite a few papers in my time, I didn't want anything too constricting. I like big challenges and haven't been afraid to put my head above the parapet in the past. I read all the Sundays and had plenty of opinions about their shortcomings. The main drawback for me about the job was that it meant I would be office-bound again. And it meant returning to Canary Wharf, the scene of my tempestuous time at Live TV, documented in all its four-letter torment by the BBC in a fly-on-the-wall epic they seem to have shown at least three times. </p> <p>I'd started at Live in a smart red suit from Joseph, and I ended it in a pair of sweat pants, banging my head against the lift doors in frustration. Having said all that, I really enjoyed setting up the station and building the studios, hiring the staff and working on the visual style of the station. I can't be bothered to rake over the boardroom shenanigans (why would I mind being fired anyway?). I was the woman who stood up at the Edinburgh TV festival and made the famous \"four Ms\" speech about the male domination of the TV industry (middle-class, mediocre and too many). So it wasn't a surprise that it went down like a cup of cold sick with another two Ms, Montgomery and MacKenzie. </p> <p>I was surprised that my appointment caused M2 (the fat one) to be so pathetically rude about my capabilities. I note that he didn't exactly spend his teenage years picking up tips in local radio but now feels perfectly qualified for his current job heading TalkSport. The night when it was announced that Greg Dyke had been appointed director-general of the BBC, we were both dining in the Ivy; he with Melvyn Bragg. Greg came over to my table, punched his fist in the air and said: \"I bloody well did it, didn't I? I pulled it off. I joined the club.\" </p> <p>I knew exactly what he meant. The campaign against Greg in broadsheets such as the Telegraph implied he was some sort of cockney barrow boy who ate jellied eels and only used single syllable words. He had brought Roland Rat to our screens, so arts programming at the BBC would be axed if he got the job. Risible, hysterical twaddle put out by the media club. But the same old garbage was dished up about me. Obviously the Telegraph (where the previous editor's wife is deputy editor) had a good dig, but so too did this paper, particularly via Roy Greenslade and Matthew Norman, two men I've never met, but who seem to know my career and shortcomings even better than I do. </p> <p>The atmosphere when I took over was tense, and the Daily Telegraph contingent who'd surrounded the previous editor soon departed. Six letters were received in mourning. I think the staff were surprised about how hands-on I intended to be. Again, having produced hundreds of hours of complicated live factual television at the BBC, why would I be intimidated by deadlines, and the juxtaposition of pictures and text? Why would I not be able to make judgments quickly about the prominence and relegation of news stories? I accept that I am loud, larger than life and common. But I am also funny, kind and sharp. I am a perfectionist, but I am not a bully. When these stories started appearing (from a disgruntled former member of staff) in Private Eye, I was appalled. But there's nothing you can do about them. Every week you have to kill stuff and there's bound to be fallout. Don't be an editor if you have a thin skin. </p> <p>At the BBC I had a large staff, a much bigger budget, and the ability to move things around when they didn't work. Now I was working with limited resources, a small team and fighting my corner in a declining market. One of the criticisms of me was that I wasn't \"zany\" enough. How ridiculous is that? Let's just look at the Sunday Express. No matter how youthful it's tried to be, and no matter how many revamps it's had, the readership is still ageing and shrinking. I have tried to hold on to our existing readers, I've focused on the areas I know they are interested in - the environment, genetically modified foods, transport and the arts. I've increased our arts coverage and set aside space every week for our passenger power campaign. </p> <p>When I took over in July 1999 the circulation was 235,000. The latest ABC figures show it was 252,000. Not a huge increase, but nothing to be ashamed of. I've brought in new editors for the review, culture and reality. We've just won scoop of the year for Geoffrey Lean's story about secret GM sites at the British Press awards the other week. I think the paper punches above its weight. It's read by opinion-formers and boy, do they give plenty of feedback. When I took the job, I had just spent a couple of years making two TV series, writing a couple of books and travelling a great deal. After nearly 10 years at the BBC, I had so enjoyed being out on the road. I told Simon Kelner I wouldn't want to do the job on a long-term basis, and after a general election seems a natural departure time. </p> <p>Except I'm not really leaving the Independent on Sunday. I'll continue my column, and write features across both papers, from travel to opera. I'm sure I'll continue to irritate my detractors, but too bad. I feel comfortable with the agenda here, and still want to be a part of it. When I started on the Daily Mail in 1969, papers were set in metal, the back bench wore white nylon shirts with string vests underneath and Lynda Lee-Potter used to take her rollers out in the ladies after her train journey in from Bournemouth. So some things change and others don't. I have not found my working environment to be particularly sexist, and black, brutal humour was always my preference anyway. </p> <p>I do think that a club exists in the media (to which Greg was alluding that night in the Ivy). It can be sneery and unwelcoming to outsiders and it is mostly male. It is obsessed with the masonic concept of newspaper editing being a craft it takes years of toil at the coalface to master. But it's nothing a smart woman won't be able to deal with. I just hope another woman edits a broadsheet before too long. </p> <p>To her I say, get stuck in, and ignore the whimperings from the establishment. It's a great job. </p> <p> <strong>Who will follow Janet? The runners and riders</strong></p> <p><strong> Tristan Davies</strong> Age: 39. Current position: executive editor (features), Indy.

      "body": "<p>It is a fair bet that every Catholic in the country knows the Universe and the Catholic Times. Piles of copies sit at the back of churches each weekend, as familiar as the roast beef and yorkshire pudding that congregations go home to after mass. For many years, they were almost as essential Sunday reading as the News of the World or the Sunday Express, giving communicant members bland news of the church and the official verdict on events. You might say they had as captive a readership as any publication in the country. Plenty of pictures of smiling bishops and priests with their happy flocks and, with luck - as this is Easter weekend - a portrait of Pope John Paul II on the front. </p> <p>But as it happens, this weekend all is not sweetness and light at the Universe - and this is not just because circulation has slumped. The Catholic bishops of England and Wales, who previously held a controlling 82% stake in the newspaper's Manchester-based publishing company, Gabriel Communications, have recently divested themselves of their loss-making publications. The bishops' hitherto more or less benign oversight - which ensured that nothing too controversial or critical ever appeared to upset the world-view of their congregations - has been surrendered to an altogether more problematic editorial future. </p> <p>The Catholic Media Trust, an agency of the bishops' conference, has been looking for a buyer for the publications for more than a year and has now found one in the form of the company's current directors. </p> <p>In 1998 Gabriel Communications - also the publisher of the Catholic Times and a number of other official church publications - received a loan of \u00a3750,000 from the trust, on the back of which it made a profit the following year of \u00a321,000. Sales, however, are still in freefall: the Universe's circulation, which peaked at an astonishing 300,000 in the 1960s and was still more than 90,000 five years ago, is now down to about 45,000, and the Catholic Times sells even fewer. Even if former sales peaks are unattainable, now that church attendances are falling and Catholics have access to a wider variety of media, the current management has certainly proved incapable of arresting the decline. </p> <p>Yet Gabriel Communications has been sold for an estimated \u00a3160,000 to a consortium of directors and senior management, led by company chairman Clive Leach, a Yorkshire millionaire and former managing director of Yorkshire Television who is a prominent donor to the Labour party. The consortium also includes managing director David Bould, marketing director Brian Ayling and editorial director Joe Kelly - a man who started as lowly features editor on the Universe as recently as 1994. </p> <p>The consortium seems to have closed a remarkably good bargain with the bishops - and with no little speed. Shareholders, including some religious orders, dioceses and individuals, were told of the CMT's plans to sell only a week before the deal went through earlier this month. They were offered 16p a share. </p> <p>Yet, as a correspondent to this week's issue of the Catholic weekly the Tablet points out, the company's last filed accounts show net assets of \u00a361,876 and profits declared at \u00a3100,000. The firm's pension fund is itself thought to be in excess of \u00a3100,000. \"Could the CMT have secured a greater return - in every sense - for the church by leaving their investment in... indeed, has it fulfilled its obligations under charity law to sell for the maximum price in order to develop its own mission?\" asks the writer, Francis Davis, chairman of a Surrey-based multimedia company. </p> <p>Journalists and former staff are already nervous of the new management. They cannot forget that these are the men who restructured the company three years ago, getting rid of three-quarters of the editorial staff. They refused to recognise the National Union of Journalists' chapel at the papers, even though the company publishes the Catholic church's official guidance that trade union membership should be supported. </p> <p>In 1997, before the last general election, the bishops' publication the Common Good, printed by Gabriel, asserted that union membership is a right that the church upholds as a manifestation of the principle of solidarity and the right of association - Catholics, where possible, it said, should join an appropriate trade union. Yet only one bishop poked his mitre above the parapet to protest at the loss of staff. </p> <p>Among the first moves of the new management, issued in a memorandum by Bould, is the decree that bad language is unacceptable in the office (it is not specified what exactly constitutes swearing) and will be punished by disciplinary action. Staff have also been warned that personal use of the internet will now be regarded as a sackable offence. Indeed, one staff member has already been dismissed under this new rule. One employee, understandably reticent of commenting publicly (even former staff have been threatened with legal action if they speak about the company), says: \"They are making up the rules as they go along to get rid of the people they don't like.\" </p> <p>The injunction does not so far appear to extend to the distributors, who continue to parcel out the papers under the vacant gaze of large posters of naked, large-breasted women. Ayling apparently jocularly told staff at Christmas not to get him anything too expensive as he would be satisfied with a Sunday Sport calendar. </p> <p>Little wonder that the new team of Bould, Ayling and Kelly have been surreptitiously christened Team Rocket by cowed staff - after an unsavoury trinity of Pokemon characters. Interestingly, Bould and Ayling are not Catholics, while Kelly, who edits the Universe, describes his faith as \"a proactive philosophy for social and personal development\" and writes for the Fortean Times, the magazine of all things psychic and supernatural. </p> <p>Before the purge of 1998, when many old stagers - those appointed by Kelly's predecessors - were dispensed with, the Universe had a team of seven journalists, a picture editor and six subeditors, almost all Catholics. Now it is produced by three subeditors and a news editor. The Catholic Times is now produced solely by its editor Kevin Flaherty, who commissions, writes, edits and designs the whole paper each week. He has been on his own since his deputy went on maternity leave at Christmas. </p> <p>The omens are not promising. The paper's advertising manager recently returned from her maternity leave to find that her job had disappeared. The circulation manager was told his job no longer existed either - and was offered a job back on the road providing he took a pay reduction of \u00a310,000. Kelly, meanwhile, is driving a new Audi. </p> <p>This has some ominous implications for the Catholic character of the papers. In recent years, rants on police brutality and the British in Northern Ireland have sometimes tended to replace reports on the activities of the church in the rest of Britain. At one point, journalists were sent a memo telling them not to use the word Catholic. </p> <p>The new owners have published a statement stressing that the existing staff remain unchanged, as do their employment rights. It adds: \"The management team will be looking to confirm the role of Gabriel as a major centre of Catholic and Christian publishing throughout the UK and Ireland. The company remains committed to continuing the work of spreading the Catholic faith through its publications and other business interests.\" </p> <p>When the Catholic bishops bought the publications in the 1980s, in the face of a barrage of criticism about trying to manipulate the press, they did so apparently to avoid a takeover by reactionary organisations such as Opus Dei. In selling them now, they appear to be handing them over to an aggressively secular management.</p>",

For many years, they were almost as essential Sunday reading as the News of the World or the Sunday Express, giving communicant members bland news of the church and the official verdict on events. You might say they had as captive a readership as any publication in the country. Plenty of pictures of smiling bishops and priests with their happy flocks and, with luck - as this is Easter weekend - a portrait of Pope John Paul II on the front. But as it happens, this weekend all is not sweetness and light at the Universe - and this is not just because circulation has slumped. The Catholic bishops of England and Wales, who previously held a controlling 82% stake in the newspaper's Manchester-based publishing company, Gabriel Communications, have recently divested themselves of their loss-making publications. The bishops' hitherto more or less benign oversight - which ensured that nothing too controversial or critical ever appeared to upset the world-view of their congregations - has been surrendered to an altogether more problematic editorial future. The Catholic Media Trust, an agency of the bishops' conference, has been looking for a buyer for the publications for more than a year and has now found one in the form of the company's current directors. In 1998 Gabriel Communications - also the publisher of the Catholic Times and a number of other official church publications - received a loan of \u00a3750,000 from the trust, on the back of which it made a profit the following year of \u00a321,000. Sales, however, are still in freefall: the Universe's circulation, which peaked at an astonishing 300,000 in the 1960s and was still more than 90,000 five years ago, is now down to about 45,000, and the Catholic Times sells even fewer. Even if former sales peaks are unattainable, now that church attendances are falling and Catholics have access to a wider variety of media, the current management has certainly proved incapable of arresting the decline. Yet Gabriel Communications has been sold for an estimated \u00a3160,000 to a consortium of directors and senior management, led by company chairman Clive Leach, a Yorkshire millionaire and former managing director of Yorkshire Television who is a prominent donor to the Labour party. The consortium also includes managing director David Bould, marketing director Brian Ayling and editorial director Joe Kelly - a man who started as lowly features editor on the Universe as recently as 1994. The consortium seems to have closed a remarkably good bargain with the bishops - and with no little speed. Shareholders, including some religious orders, dioceses and individuals, were told of the CMT's plans to sell only a week before the deal went through earlier this month. They were offered 16p a share. Yet, as a correspondent to this week's issue of the Catholic weekly the Tablet points out, the company's last filed accounts show net assets of \u00a361,876 and profits declared at \u00a3100,000. The firm's pension fund is itself thought to be in excess of \u00a3100,000. \"Could the CMT have secured a greater return - in every sense - for the church by leaving their investment in... indeed, has it fulfilled its obligations under charity law to sell for the maximum price in order to develop its own mission?\" asks the writer, Francis Davis, chairman of a Surrey-based multimedia company. Journalists and former staff are already nervous of the new management. They cannot forget that these are the men who restructured the company three years ago, getting rid of three-quarters of the editorial staff. They refused to recognise the National Union of Journalists' chapel at the papers, even though the company publishes the Catholic church's official guidance that trade union membership should be supported. In 1997, before the last general election, the bishops' publication the Common Good, printed by Gabriel, asserted that union membership is a right that the church upholds as a manifestation of the principle of solidarity and the right of association - Catholics, where possible, it said, should join an appropriate trade union. Yet only one bishop poked his mitre above the parapet to protest at the loss of staff. Among the first moves of the new management, issued in a memorandum by Bould, is the decree that bad language is unacceptable in the office (it is not specified what exactly constitutes swearing) and will be punished by disciplinary action. Staff have also been warned that personal use of the internet will now be regarded as a sackable offence. Indeed, one staff member has already been dismissed under this new rule. One employee, understandably reticent of commenting publicly (even former staff have been threatened with legal action if they speak about the company), says: \"They are making up the rules as they go along to get rid of the people they don't like.\" The injunction does not so far appear to extend to the distributors, who continue to parcel out the papers under the vacant gaze of large posters of naked, large-breasted women. Ayling apparently jocularly told staff at Christmas not to get him anything too expensive as he would be satisfied with a Sunday Sport calendar. Little wonder that the new team of Bould, Ayling and Kelly have been surreptitiously christened Team Rocket by cowed staff - after an unsavoury trinity of Pokemon characters. Interestingly, Bould and Ayling are not Catholics, while Kelly, who edits the Universe, describes his faith as \"a proactive philosophy for social and personal development\" and writes for the Fortean Times, the magazine of all things psychic and supernatural. Before the purge of 1998, when many old stagers - those appointed by Kelly's predecessors - were dispensed with, the Universe had a team of seven journalists, a picture editor and six subeditors, almost all Catholics. Now it is produced by three subeditors and a news editor. The Catholic Times is now produced solely by its editor Kevin Flaherty, who commissions, writes, edits and designs the whole paper each week. He has been on his own since his deputy went on maternity leave at Christmas. The omens are not promising. The paper's advertising manager recently returned from her maternity leave to find that her job had disappeared. The circulation manager was told his job no longer existed either - and was offered a job back on the road providing he took a pay reduction of \u00a310,000. Kelly, meanwhile, is driving a new Audi. This has some ominous implications for the Catholic character of the papers. In recent years, rants on police brutality and the British in Northern Ireland have sometimes tended to replace reports on the activities of the church in the rest of Britain. At one point, journalists were sent a memo telling them not to use the word Catholic. The new owners have published a statement stressing that the existing staff remain unchanged, as do their employment rights. It adds: \"The management team will be looking to confirm the role of Gabriel as a major centre of Catholic and Christian publishing throughout the UK and Ireland. The company remains committed to continuing the work of spreading the Catholic faith through its publications and other business interests.\" When the Catholic bishops bought the publications in the 1980s, in the face of a barrage of criticism about trying to manipulate the press, they did so apparently to avoid a takeover by reactionary organisations such as Opus Dei. In selling them now, they appear to be handing them over to an aggressively secular management.",

Neatly, the stateside launch of the rudest woman on television coincides with a six-month anniversary for the smallest woman in television. For it was in October last year that Lorraine Heggessey signalled the biggest revolution in BBC1 since the advent of EastEnders by remaking the schedule and moving the peak-time news bulletin, aided by Robinson leading the charge of the light entertainment brigade. </p> <p>The success of the Weakest Link in denting the peaktime audience of ITV was a great boost to BBC morale. Although the corporation hype that it was more popular than Millionaire is a myth (albeit one that is being extensively exploited in the US), its highly visible success gave Heggessey an early fillip. </p> <p>The schedule relaunch, precipitated by the hasty move of the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm, was a huge risk. Just weeks earlier, director of television Mark Thompson had insisted the BBC would not repeat the mistakes of ITV, which axed News at Ten without having sufficient programmes to put in its place. ITV was finally forced into a mildly humiliating climbdown after news ratings plunged. Yet such was the gung-ho attitude under new director-general Greg Dyke that the BBC thought it could get away with it. </p> <p>With a bit of fancy footwork by the schedulers (which consisted mainly of raiding daytime for Weakest Link and BBC2 for Have I Got News for You), and some good luck with an extremely busy news agenda, ratings for the 10pm news have held up and peaktime BBC1 has declined only marginally. The government's dogs have been held at bay, the drama department is working overtime to bring on landmark projects for the autumn, and there are even signs of life in the notoriously unreconstructed BBC publicity department. </p> <p>This October revolution may not have been as bloody as the original, but it was the marker of the new BBC. \"I think it sent a very important signal that BBC1 is not going to be as slow to change as it has in the past, and we will take some risks,\" says Heggessey. \"That's very important - if you don't take risks and fail, that's one thing, but at least if you take some risks and fail then you feel better, you can move on to the next thing and try something else.\" </p> <p>Out of the risks, there have been some notable hits in the past six months. EastEnders has been on spectacular form, knocking Coronation Street for six with a series of slick storylines that culminated in the shooting of Phil Mitchell. Heggessey had the self-confidence to make a real event out of the attempted murder in the Square: the shooting episode was scheduled around a Weakest Link special with the EastEnders cast and a populist documentary on the yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur. A month or so later, the night on which the would-be killer was revealed handily coincided with a key Uefa football tie. </p> <p>The Crime Doubles series, in which blockbuster shows were shown on consecutive evenings, was another Heggessey scheduling trick. Although the success was mixed: only Silent Witness and NCS Manhunt came out with any sense of pride intact. NCS - and the slightly weaker In Deep - will return. </p> <p>It is clear that \"event TV\" - once the favourite term of David Liddiment at ITV - is now a buzz phrase at the new BBC1. \"You always have to maximise your assets. If you behave as if you're confident with what you've got, then the viewers might feel that confidence too,\" says Heggessey. </p> <p>But there have been some real stinkers. Adrian Mole was a flop, and the script for Office Gossip should never have made it past Pauline Quirke's shredder. </p> <p>Perhaps the worst aspect of the past six months has been the drama disasters of Sunday nights. Five lavish shows went down the ratings plughole, with the woefully scheduled Rebel Heart collapsing to a record low. </p> <p>The BBC wobbled, and the critically acclaimed Clocking Off was moved out of Sunday nights and sent over the top against Millionaire on Mondays. Even ITV could not believe what the BBC had done: drama chief Nick Elliott accused the corporation of panic, and writer Paul Abbott's unease appeared justified. </p> <p>Heggessey believes there has been a fundamental shift in what viewers want to see on Sunday evenings on BBC1, and it seems to have taken her by surprise. \"It's interesting, something is happening there. Viewers do not want to watch Take a Girl Like You or Love in a Cold Climate in as many numbers as London's Burning or Heartbeat. Maybe we have been doing too much of the same for too long,\" she says. Successful scheduling of Superhuman and Son of God in the traditional drama slot of Sunday evenings is a sign of things to come: more \"quality factual\" and \"entertainment-skewed\" shows will be Sunday night staples from now on. </p> <p>And she defends the scheduling of Clocking Off. \"Millionaire is a fact of life for us. You can't run away from it. You have to put strong pieces against it - if you put weak things against it then you just get nowhere.\" Heggessey also believes it offers viewers a genuine choice - which is why the Weakest Link will never go head-to-head with Millionaire. It seems that, in the long term, Heggessey believes that the potency of Millionaire can be diluted with consistent scheduling of strong, different offerings against it. </p> <p>It is to the credit of the new regime that this image of dynamism has been maintained into the summer. In a breathtaking piece of spin, the recent launch of the BBC1 spring and summer schedule was dominated by a show that technically should not have been there at all. Son of God, the landmark series that prompted saturation coverage in the next day's press, was actually part of the winter schedule. But the dramatic story (it's not often that a picture of Christ lands on a newsdesk at lunchtime) obscured the lack of substance in what Heggessey had to offer. </p> <p>There are 14 new dramas - but only one of them, Mersey Beat, has anything remotely resembling promise about it. And even then, it's another police series. The rest of the schedule was as thin as the excruciating jokes in the embarrassing, pun-laden speech that Heggessey had the brass neck to read out. </p> <p>Clearly, all eyes are trained on the autumn, when the \u00a3100m extra investment in drama will begin to bear fruit. There will be some big events before then - key boxing matches and a new series of Friends Like These with Ian Wright for a start - but the Heggessey BBC1 will not be complete until the end of the year. Executives know that they are flying by the seat of their pants until then.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The top line is that BBC1 has improved its ratings between 9pm and 10pm since the news move. Between October 16 and March 25, the average BBC1 audience across this hour has been 6.6m. This is up by 0.8m compared to the equivalent period in 1999-2000. In audience share terms, BBC1 has raised its game between 9pm and 10pm year-on-year from 23.7% to 26.3%. However, this improvement between 9pm and 10pm has not been enough to stem the overall decline of the BBC1 peaktime audience, measured between 6pm and 10.30pm. Since October 16, BBC1 has averaged a 28.6% peaktime share, compared to 30.2% in the equivalent period 12 months earlier.

      "body": "<p>In the chaos and noise of the riot, I didn't see the petrol bomb whizzing at me, and would have taken a direct hit if Liz hadn't wrenched me out of the way a second before it exploded, scorching a violent, orange streak across the road. </p> <p>We ran out into the road just as 30 protesters began another Braveheart style charge at the police lines, throwing more petrol bombs and lumps of wood. One PC must have taken a blow to the head because he fell flat on his back. And exactly the same thing is going to happen to me, I thought, unless we get out of here now. </p> <p>I wondered what Liz and I should do next. A man had appeared at my right shoulder and had a suggestion. He said we've got to interview one of the riot ringleaders, who is in the thick of the action. </p> <p>To get to him, we've got to push past the thugs who have already threatened us, including a man with a baseball bat and bad attitude, while avoiding charging policemen and dozens of wooden bricks which are flying in all directions. </p> <p>Is he kidding? Obviously not. \"Go on,\" he insists. It's all right for him, he's built like a tank - Desperate Dan jaw, barrel chest and thighs for forearms. </p> <p>He served in the SAS for several years, including during the Gulf war, when he was a member of ill-fated Bravo Two Zero team which was dropped behind enemy lines in Iraq. </p> <p>\"Oh, God,\" I think. I'm under orders, so I've no choice. Liz and I head off into the carnage and smoke . . . </p> <p>This wasn't a bad dream. It did happen. There was a riot, and a petrol bomb did explode two inches from my nose, Liz and I were bombarded with wooden bricks and flying glass, and hooligans threatened us with baseball bats. The man on our shoulder, Dr Mal Macgown did look like a comic strip hero and he is a Bravo Two Zero veteran, though he doesn't talk about it. But the riot we were caught in, though realistic, was not real. We were in Hounslow, west London, taking part in a pioneering safety awareness course set up by Macgown's company, Pilgrims Group. </p> <p>It was asked to design a course by the BBC, primarily because of concerns that TV and radio crews were in frontline positions covering riots and civil disturbances, from the Drumcree marches to the anti-capitalist demonstrations, without proper training. </p> <p>When it was launched two years ago, some senior hacks grumbled. Journalists can be peculiarly dismis sive of training, preferring to believe old-fashioned nous is protection enough in the sort of danger zones that police officers and soldiers spend years learning to cope with. </p> <p>But there is a big problem with relying on common sense. It is a faculty that routinely goes Awol as soon as trouble starts. </p> <p>One reporter sent to cover the Handsworth riots in Birmingham reputedly turned up after an evening meeting of the Territorial Army, where he was a senior officer. Other journalists, who were crouching for safety behind a car, saw their colleague striding towards them through the haze in a ceremonial white suit, plumed helmet, hand clasped firmly on the hilt of his sword. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the reporter was seen trying to file copy from a telephone box that was being rocked backwards and forwards by a group of protesters. He survived this encounter unscathed. </p> <p>Journalists, however, often get injured in far less extraordinary circumstances, or expensive cameras are stolen and films destroyed, leaving news coverage affected, which is where Macgown, 40, comes in. </p> <p>With Russ Ticehurst - who also served in the SAS - and Malcolm Knight, a former police training instructor, he devised the safety course and has held more than 30 of them, putting nine journalists at a time through a series of exercises over eight hours, culminating in a full-scale night riot. As you might expect, it's a slick operation. </p> <p>The training centre itself is like the EastEnders set. There is a mock-up town with a pub, bank, shops, a high street and side alleys. </p> <p>I was teamed with Liz from BBC News24, and together we were led around the site by Macgown, who encouraged us to discuss \"angles of vision\", \"proximity to safety\" and \"maintaining the integrity of exits and entrances\". </p> <p>Liz and I were hopeless at this. </p> <p>Using innate wit and skill, our first task was to snoop on a group of pretend protesters and avoid aggravating them. </p> <p>Yet our plan of action would, Macgown suggested politely, have had us running for our lives within seconds. The \"conflict management\" phase of the course did not start with any more success. </p> <p>There's something about role-playing that I've always found a bit embarrassing, and this exercise involved trying to pacify and then escape from some farmers angered by the foot and mouth crisis who have turned on a film crew. </p> <p>Liz and I were the film crew. Knight, who is 6ft 6in, was particularly convincing as a furious farmer, jostling and barging us backwards as we whimpered at him to stop. </p> <p>We performed much better when we had a second chance. By then, we'd been told about \"back-watching\" and defensive arm positions. We'd also found our voices. </p> <p>Nothing is left to chance. Car parking, first aid kits and wardrobe (best to be in cotton if you're about to go up in flames) were considered at length; measures that Ticehurst referred to as the art of \"self-sustainability\". </p> <p>Before we were set loose in the riot, we had a rite of passage - the petrol bomb walk. </p> <p>Dressed in fire-resistant overalls, boots, gloves and police helmets, we marched to a back street in the model town where three other instructors were waiting for us with a wheelbarrow full of petrol bombs. </p> <p>\"If one of these has your name on it,\" barked the man in charge, \"if it's coming your way, don't just freeze. Sidestep - like so - and if it explodes in front of you, walk on through and stamp your feet.\" </p> <p>He said our overalls would protect us from the standard petrol bomb - unleaded, no additives, half-full bottles - for eight seconds. </p> <p>There is a technique for stopping flames rushing up your nose and scalding your lungs. It involves hunching your shoulders until you have no neck and wrapping one arm around your chin. Although only intended as an emergency brace, some of us were reluctant to take chances and managed to hold this undignified position for the rest of the exercise. </p> <p>Nobody in our group asked any questions at the end of the talk. In fact, nobody said anything as we lined up at one end of the road, and the officers stood at the other, about 50 metres away. </p> <p>At the signal, we inched forward and waited for the bombardment to start. One bottle did explode just in front of me and I walked through the flames, as predicted, unharmed. </p> <p>But in my determination to remain cool, I hadn't realised the back of my suit had caught fire - \"poor awareness\" - and strolled on, oblivious. Knight put me out with a fire extinguisher before I'd noticed the problem. </p> <p>Later, an instructor demonstrated what happens when protesters dissolve plastic cups and elastic bands in the petrol they use for their bombs. </p> <p>\"You'd be lucky to survive that,\" he said, as we watched the petrol ignite and then sizzle like acid. </p> <p>That took us to the finale where 60 Metropolitan police officers are plunged into a riot with 30 rampaging hooligans. The rioters' job is to harass, humiliate and provoke the police on exercises like this. Our presence, as reporters trying to cover the story, is part of the experience for both sides. </p> <p>Everything we were taught and told in the hours beforehand became urgently relevant once the battle began.

      "bodyText": "In the chaos and noise of the riot, I didn't see the petrol bomb whizzing at me, and would have taken a direct hit if Liz hadn't wrenched me out of the way a second before it exploded, scorching a violent, orange streak across the road. We ran out into the road just as 30 protesters began another Braveheart style charge at the police lines, throwing more petrol bombs and lumps of wood. One PC must have taken a blow to the head because he fell flat on his back. And exactly the same thing is going to happen to me, I thought, unless we get out of here now. I wondered what Liz and I should do next. A man had appeared at my right shoulder and had a suggestion. He said we've got to interview one of the riot ringleaders, who is in the thick of the action. To get to him, we've got to push past the thugs who have already threatened us, including a man with a baseball bat and bad attitude, while avoiding charging policemen and dozens of wooden bricks which are flying in all directions. Is he kidding? Obviously not. \"Go on,\" he insists. It's all right for him, he's built like a tank - Desperate Dan jaw, barrel chest and thighs for forearms. He served in the SAS for several years, including during the Gulf war, when he was a member of ill-fated Bravo Two Zero team which was dropped behind enemy lines in Iraq. \"Oh, God,\" I think. I'm under orders, so I've no choice. Liz and I head off into the carnage and smoke . . . This wasn't a bad dream. It did happen. There was a riot, and a petrol bomb did explode two inches from my nose, Liz and I were bombarded with wooden bricks and flying glass, and hooligans threatened us with baseball bats. The man on our shoulder, Dr Mal Macgown did look like a comic strip hero and he is a Bravo Two Zero veteran, though he doesn't talk about it. But the riot we were caught in, though realistic, was not real. We were in Hounslow, west London, taking part in a pioneering safety awareness course set up by Macgown's company, Pilgrims Group. It was asked to design a course by the BBC, primarily because of concerns that TV and radio crews were in frontline positions covering riots and civil disturbances, from the Drumcree marches to the anti-capitalist demonstrations, without proper training. When it was launched two years ago, some senior hacks grumbled. Journalists can be peculiarly dismis sive of training, preferring to believe old-fashioned nous is protection enough in the sort of danger zones that police officers and soldiers spend years learning to cope with. But there is a big problem with relying on common sense. It is a faculty that routinely goes Awol as soon as trouble starts. One reporter sent to cover the Handsworth riots in Birmingham reputedly turned up after an evening meeting of the Territorial Army, where he was a senior officer. Other journalists, who were crouching for safety behind a car, saw their colleague striding towards them through the haze in a ceremonial white suit, plumed helmet, hand clasped firmly on the hilt of his sword. Shortly afterwards, the reporter was seen trying to file copy from a telephone box that was being rocked backwards and forwards by a group of protesters. He survived this encounter unscathed. Journalists, however, often get injured in far less extraordinary circumstances, or expensive cameras are stolen and films destroyed, leaving news coverage affected, which is where Macgown, 40, comes in. With Russ Ticehurst - who also served in the SAS - and Malcolm Knight, a former police training instructor, he devised the safety course and has held more than 30 of them, putting nine journalists at a time through a series of exercises over eight hours, culminating in a full-scale night riot. As you might expect, it's a slick operation. The training centre itself is like the EastEnders set. There is a mock-up town with a pub, bank, shops, a high street and side alleys. I was teamed with Liz from BBC News24, and together we were led around the site by Macgown, who encouraged us to discuss \"angles of vision\", \"proximity to safety\" and \"maintaining the integrity of exits and entrances\". Liz and I were hopeless at this. Using innate wit and skill, our first task was to snoop on a group of pretend protesters and avoid aggravating them. Yet our plan of action would, Macgown suggested politely, have had us running for our lives within seconds. The \"conflict management\" phase of the course did not start with any more success. There's something about role-playing that I've always found a bit embarrassing, and this exercise involved trying to pacify and then escape from some farmers angered by the foot and mouth crisis who have turned on a film crew. Liz and I were the film crew. Knight, who is 6ft 6in, was particularly convincing as a furious farmer, jostling and barging us backwards as we whimpered at him to stop. We performed much better when we had a second chance. By then, we'd been told about \"back-watching\" and defensive arm positions. We'd also found our voices. Nothing is left to chance. Car parking, first aid kits and wardrobe (best to be in cotton if you're about to go up in flames) were considered at length; measures that Ticehurst referred to as the art of \"self-sustainability\". Before we were set loose in the riot, we had a rite of passage - the petrol bomb walk. Dressed in fire-resistant overalls, boots, gloves and police helmets, we marched to a back street in the model town where three other instructors were waiting for us with a wheelbarrow full of petrol bombs. \"If one of these has your name on it,\" barked the man in charge, \"if it's coming your way, don't just freeze. Sidestep - like so - and if it explodes in front of you, walk on through and stamp your feet.\" He said our overalls would protect us from the standard petrol bomb - unleaded, no additives, half-full bottles - for eight seconds. There is a technique for stopping flames rushing up your nose and scalding your lungs. It involves hunching your shoulders until you have no neck and wrapping one arm around your chin. Although only intended as an emergency brace, some of us were reluctant to take chances and managed to hold this undignified position for the rest of the exercise. Nobody in our group asked any questions at the end of the talk. In fact, nobody said anything as we lined up at one end of the road, and the officers stood at the other, about 50 metres away. At the signal, we inched forward and waited for the bombardment to start. One bottle did explode just in front of me and I walked through the flames, as predicted, unharmed. But in my determination to remain cool, I hadn't realised the back of my suit had caught fire - \"poor awareness\" - and strolled on, oblivious. Knight put me out with a fire extinguisher before I'd noticed the problem. Later, an instructor demonstrated what happens when protesters dissolve plastic cups and elastic bands in the petrol they use for their bombs. \"You'd be lucky to survive that,\" he said, as we watched the petrol ignite and then sizzle like acid. That took us to the finale where 60 Metropolitan police officers are plunged into a riot with 30 rampaging hooligans. The rioters' job is to harass, humiliate and provoke the police on exercises like this. Our presence, as reporters trying to cover the story, is part of the experience for both sides. Everything we were taught and told in the hours beforehand became urgently relevant once the battle began. We ran around like headless chickens, we got ourselves in and out of dangerous situations, and we sweated loads. We also survived, shadowed at all times by Macgown, who thought we'd performed reasonably well. \"You dithered a little bit to begin with,\" he told us. \"But you were much more decisive in the second half.\" The BBC has a rolling programme to get journalists riot-trained as quickly as possible. Those who have been on the course have returned to duty somewhat chastened, saying they realised they'd been getting away with it in terms of safety. ITN, Reuters and other news agencies are also sending staff. \"There's been an increase in riots over the last five years, and some of our young reporters were being put in dangerous situations they'd had no experience of,\" says Tony Loughran, safety and security adviser for BBC News and the World Service. \"We've had casualties in the past, but fewer now.

      "body": "<p>Ted Turner, the founder of CNN cable news who is celebrated and reviled in equal measure as the \"Mouth from the South\", says that he has considered suicide in the past year.</p> <p>Mr Turner, who once compared Rupert Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, describes the previous 12 months as among the most miserable of his 63 years, in an interview with the New Yorker magazine. At the beginning of the period he had seemed invulnerable as the biggest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, companies that were soon to merge. By the end of it he had been sacked; his eight-year marriage to the film star Jane Fonda was over; he broke his foot in a skiing accident; two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with a rare enzyme deficiency; and his much-loved labrador Chief was temporarily paralysed with coonhound disease.</p> <p> \"I felt like Job,\" he says in the latest edition of the New Yorker. Not for the first time, the biggest individual landowner in the United States - he has 2m acres - also felt \"suicidal\".</p> <p> Mr Turner says that he received a telephone call last May from Gerald Levin, chief executive officer of Time Warner, telling him that Turner Broadcasting - his original media powerbase, which he had nurtured since 1970 - would no longer report to him. \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well,\" he recalls Mr Levin saying. Fonda, his third wife, tells the magazine: \"The way it was handled was really shocking. It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call?\"</p> <p>Mr Turner's father would beat him with a wire coat hanger and sometimes decided that a greater punishment would be to have his son beat him instead. Ed Turner committed suicide at 53. \"Why this guy [Ted Turner] didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know,\" says 63-year-old Fonda. \"It scarred him for life. It colours everything - his relationships and his anxieties. \"I say this with all the love in the world. He has been severely, hauntingly traumatised. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanancy and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him.\"</p> <p>Another reason is Fonda's religious conversion. Mr Turner says: \"She just came home and said 'I've become a Christian.'

      "bodyText": "Ted Turner, the founder of CNN cable news who is celebrated and reviled in equal measure as the \"Mouth from the South\", says that he has considered suicide in the past year. Mr Turner, who once compared Rupert Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, describes the previous 12 months as among the most miserable of his 63 years, in an interview with the New Yorker magazine. At the beginning of the period he had seemed invulnerable as the biggest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, companies that were soon to merge. By the end of it he had been sacked; his eight-year marriage to the film star Jane Fonda was over; he broke his foot in a skiing accident; two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with a rare enzyme deficiency; and his much-loved labrador Chief was temporarily paralysed with coonhound disease. \"I felt like Job,\" he says in the latest edition of the New Yorker. Not for the first time, the biggest individual landowner in the United States - he has 2m acres - also felt \"suicidal\". Mr Turner says that he received a telephone call last May from Gerald Levin, chief executive officer of Time Warner, telling him that Turner Broadcasting - his original media powerbase, which he had nurtured since 1970 - would no longer report to him. \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well,\" he recalls Mr Levin saying. Fonda, his third wife, tells the magazine: \"The way it was handled was really shocking. It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call?\" Mr Turner's father would beat him with a wire coat hanger and sometimes decided that a greater punishment would be to have his son beat him instead. Ed Turner committed suicide at 53. \"Why this guy [Ted Turner] didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know,\" says 63-year-old Fonda. \"It scarred him for life. It colours everything - his relationships and his anxieties. \"I say this with all the love in the world. He has been severely, hauntingly traumatised. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanancy and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him.\" Another reason is Fonda's religious conversion. Mr Turner says: \"She just came home and said 'I've become a Christian.' Before that she was not a religious person. That's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you.\" Fonda, who won an Oscar for her role in Klute and was once known as Hanoi Jane for her opposition, since recanted, to the Vietnam war, does not disagree. \"My becoming a Christian upset him very much for good reason. He's my husband and I chose not to discuss it with him because he would have talked me out of it. He's a debating champion.\" Mr Levin tells the magazine: \"I didn't fire Ted. I said: 'This is the way we need to run the company.' Ted is by far the most interesting person I've ever met - how he reacts to things. It's as if a child were speaking without any social inhibitions. \"You don't say in business 'I got fired.'

      "body": "<p>Not many MPs enjoy quite such a dramatic view of their constituency from their sitting room window as does Michael Howard, MP for Folkestone and Hythe.</p> <p>Nestling on the rising ground above the English Channel, it looks down on the flat expanse of Romney Marsh, which some local voters affectionately call \"the sixth continent\".</p> <p>The fact that the woods behind the house still contain a serious, round-the-clock police presence is a reminder that, in his time, the former Conservative home secretary made some dangerous terrorist enemies.</p> <p>But as election day looms the more urgent question is: has Mr Howard made enough enemies among Folkestone voters for the seat to fall to Lib-Lab tactical voting ?</p> <p>In 1997 the seat featured in a famous \u00a380,000 exercise conducted by Peter Kellner and ICM for the Observer: 16 seats with tactical anti-Tory possibilities were analysed and advice offered. It worked spectacularly in Enfield Southgate, where Michael Portillo's wholly unexpected defeat was the biggest single upset of the night.</p> <p>It did not work in Folkestone.</p> <p>In 1992 Mr Howard had taken 52.3% of the vote against 35.3% for the Liberal Democrats and 12.1% for Labour, not far adrift from the 57:32:10 shares the three had when he inherited the seat in 1983.</p> <p>On the night of May 1 1997, when Tory seats all along the south coast were falling to the Blair-Ashdown tide (nearby Dover, Hastings &amp; Rye, Hove, even Torbay), Mr Howard's majority fell from 8,910 to 6,332, from 17% to 12.2%. If ever a seat was going to fall, surely, the moment must have passed that night?</p> <p>But hope springs eternal as June 7 2001 approaches. This weekend both Peter Carroll, the new Liberal Democrat candidate, and Labour's even newer hopeful, Albert Catterall, have been out canvassing hard. Why?</p> <p>\"The difference between this time and last time was that then the anti-Conservative vote was split three ways because there was also a Referendum party candidate,\" explains the Lib Dem agent, Shaun Roberts. \"This time it will come to us.\"</p> <p>A familiar Lib Dem tale, but far from impossible. In 1997 Labour's big push failed to take second place, but got to within 1,042 votes of the Lib Dem, 24.9% of the poll compared with 26.9%.

      "bodyText": "Not many MPs enjoy quite such a dramatic view of their constituency from their sitting room window as does Michael Howard, MP for Folkestone and Hythe. Nestling on the rising ground above the English Channel, it looks down on the flat expanse of Romney Marsh, which some local voters affectionately call \"the sixth continent\". The fact that the woods behind the house still contain a serious, round-the-clock police presence is a reminder that, in his time, the former Conservative home secretary made some dangerous terrorist enemies. But as election day looms the more urgent question is: has Mr Howard made enough enemies among Folkestone voters for the seat to fall to Lib-Lab tactical voting ? In 1997 the seat featured in a famous \u00a380,000 exercise conducted by Peter Kellner and ICM for the Observer: 16 seats with tactical anti-Tory possibilities were analysed and advice offered. It worked spectacularly in Enfield Southgate, where Michael Portillo's wholly unexpected defeat was the biggest single upset of the night. It did not work in Folkestone. In 1992 Mr Howard had taken 52.3% of the vote against 35.3% for the Liberal Democrats and 12.1% for Labour, not far adrift from the 57:32:10 shares the three had when he inherited the seat in 1983. On the night of May 1 1997, when Tory seats all along the south coast were falling to the Blair-Ashdown tide (nearby Dover, Hastings &amp; Rye, Hove, even Torbay), Mr Howard's majority fell from 8,910 to 6,332, from 17% to 12.2%. If ever a seat was going to fall, surely, the moment must have passed that night? But hope springs eternal as June 7 2001 approaches. This weekend both Peter Carroll, the new Liberal Democrat candidate, and Labour's even newer hopeful, Albert Catterall, have been out canvassing hard. Why? \"The difference between this time and last time was that then the anti-Conservative vote was split three ways because there was also a Referendum party candidate,\" explains the Lib Dem agent, Shaun Roberts. \"This time it will come to us.\" A familiar Lib Dem tale, but far from impossible. In 1997 Labour's big push failed to take second place, but got to within 1,042 votes of the Lib Dem, 24.9% of the poll compared with 26.9%. The late John Aspinall took 8% on behalf of his old gambling friend, Jimmy Goldsmith; the UKIP got 0.7%. It left Mr Howard on a very takeable 39% if the constituency's voters decide to gang up against him. Unlike 1997, when people voted \"blind\" on new boundaries, the route is clear. \"I never take the constituency for granted,\" says Mr Howard whenever he is asked. \"There may be a UKIP candidate, but I hope the Referendum party votes will come back and that we get a fair number of votes from the other parties too.\" Along with the parlous state of local hospitals, he cites Europe and the asylum issue as important to East Kent. Mr Howard is a convincing tough guy on both. \"My constituency is on the sharp end,\" he notes. Literally so in the case of the Channel tunnel. There are about 600 asylum seekers in Folkestone, but things are calmer than two years ago. Though a keen pro-European in 1983 the MP is no enthusiast for the euro. And though his father, a Romanian Jew, fled to the safety of Wales, Mr Howard distinguishes between real and unjustified asylum applications. \"When I was home secretary we changed the law and cut the number of asylum seekers by 40%. Labour failed to close a loophole, sent out the wrong signals, and the 'magnet' problem has flared again. \"It is a perfectly straight-forward proposition in theory: everyone agrees that we have to have a proper system of immigration control on this small and crowded island.\" Crisp and diamond-hard, like the successful planning QC that Mr Howard is.

      "body": "<p>American lobbyists have apparently abandoned the real White House in favour of the virtual one. Instead of trying to interest President George Bush in their causes, they have been deluging the makers of the popular television series, West Wing, with requests for airtime on the show.</p> <p>A recent episode featured Martin Sheen's character, president Josiah Bartlett, getting to grips with the ins and outs of the long-running trade dispute between the European Union and the US over bananas. Lo and behold, last week Brussels and Washington announced a ceasefire in the banana war: the US will lift its punitive sanctions on EU luxury goods and Europeans will abandon their banana quotas, which favour former Caribbean colonies at the expense of bananas from US-owned plantations in Latin America.</p> <p>Like the spy plane saga, both sides have left the battlefield claiming victory although it's clear who the losers will be: small farmers in the Windward Isles whose produce cannot compete with the cheaper dollar bananas. When they are forced off the land, the EU should bear as much of the blame as Washington. Its import regime has encouraged former colonies to stick to single crop commodity economies - not smart in a more integrated world. </p> <p>For years, the EU has been promising to help the producers diversify while actually delivering little. Now it looks as if many banana growers are diversifying into growing marijuana - one crop for which there is plenty of demand.</p> <p>Primetime TV references aside, the real reason for the detente on the banana front is that both sides are preparing for a much bigger fight: the struggle to launch a new round of global trade talks at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Qatar this November.</p> <p>After the debacle 18 months ago of the Seattle talks - which collapsed after a week of deadlock between the leading trading powers while pitched battles raged outside between anti-globalisation protesters and police - everyone is anxious to make sure Qatar is not a repeat showing. Ambassadors at WTO headquarters in Geneva have been given until July to thrash out the main issues for the Qatar agenda by the WTO chief, Mike Moore. If it looks like the \"Quad\" - the EU, the US, Canada and Japan - are close to agreeing what should be on the table, Qatar will be used as a launchpad for the new round.</p> <p>What may have escaped the notice of the four big trading powers is that they no longer make the rules. The WTO is now dominated by developing countries, and it was largely because they became fed up with the Quad's high-handed tactics that the Seattle talks fell apart. To get them back to the negotiating table is not going to be a simple matter, and so far they are fairly unimpressed with what the Quad is offering. </p> <p>The EU missed a golden opportunity recently to score some relatively painless public relations points with the least developed countries under the \"everything but arms\" proposal, which was supposed to allow tariff-free access to EU markets for goods from the world's 48 least developed countries, or LDCs. </p> <p>The lobbyists got in first and carved out exceptions to the agreement which made it virtually worthless: 70% of its potential benefits to LDCs would have come from more liberal access for sugar, rice and beef, but liberalisation of those three goods has been deferred until 2006. The message appears to be that although Europe is committed - in theory at least - to offering poor countries a better trade deal, in practice even a tiny lobby group like the sugar beet industry can prevent it.</p> <p>The basic gripe of the developing world is that when it comes to trade, the west says one thing and does another. While protecting its own vulnerable sectors from competition, it demands that southern countries liberalise. The two markets of most importance to southern economies, agriculture and textiles, are among the most protected in the west.</p> <p>Forthcoming research from Oxfam will show the cost of trade barriers to developing countries is far higher than the amount western countries spend on official aid programmes. One recent study estimated that rich countries spend enough on subsidising their farmers to fly every single cow in the west around the world first class. That's not only a huge waste of western taxpayers' money but a huge cost to developing world countries which could be producing food for western markets more efficiently and at less cost to the environment - where land is cheaper, agriculture can be extensive rather than intensive. </p> <p><strong>Subsidy-bloated lobbies</strong></p> <p>The west shows no appetite to take on its subsidy-bloated producer lobbies, as the failure to unblock access to sugar, rice and beef under \"everything but arms\" shows. Although foot and mouth and BSE have sparked calls for an overhaul of the European common agricultural policy, the agenda is being driven by consumer panic over industrial farming - and the likely outcome is more subsidies, this time for environmentally approved farming methods. In the meantime, western trade barriers are costing farmers in the developing world $20bn a year.</p> <p>While the west protects and subsidises, the developing world is being forced to liberalise. Though global trade talks have been on hold since the end of the Uruguay round in 1994, poor countries are slashing tariff barriers under the aegis of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes. </p> <p>Most economists agree that in the long term countries with lower trade barriers do better, because they are exposed to global competition which makes their economies more efficient. Development experts point out that while the theory is fine, the reality is that poor countries have accomplished the kind of reductions in tariff barriers over the last decade which took the west 50 years to achieve. The adjustment costs have been painful in many cases and because the tariff cuts have been made outside a trade round, they have not even gained reciprocal market access.</p> <p>Divisions between the west and the developing world on trade will be clearly visible at this week's Quebec summit to launch talks on setting up a free trade area of the Americas.

      "bodyText": "American lobbyists have apparently abandoned the real White House in favour of the virtual one. Instead of trying to interest President George Bush in their causes, they have been deluging the makers of the popular television series, West Wing, with requests for airtime on the show. A recent episode featured Martin Sheen's character, president Josiah Bartlett, getting to grips with the ins and outs of the long-running trade dispute between the European Union and the US over bananas. Lo and behold, last week Brussels and Washington announced a ceasefire in the banana war: the US will lift its punitive sanctions on EU luxury goods and Europeans will abandon their banana quotas, which favour former Caribbean colonies at the expense of bananas from US-owned plantations in Latin America. Like the spy plane saga, both sides have left the battlefield claiming victory although it's clear who the losers will be: small farmers in the Windward Isles whose produce cannot compete with the cheaper dollar bananas. When they are forced off the land, the EU should bear as much of the blame as Washington. Its import regime has encouraged former colonies to stick to single crop commodity economies - not smart in a more integrated world. For years, the EU has been promising to help the producers diversify while actually delivering little. Now it looks as if many banana growers are diversifying into growing marijuana - one crop for which there is plenty of demand. Primetime TV references aside, the real reason for the detente on the banana front is that both sides are preparing for a much bigger fight: the struggle to launch a new round of global trade talks at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Qatar this November. After the debacle 18 months ago of the Seattle talks - which collapsed after a week of deadlock between the leading trading powers while pitched battles raged outside between anti-globalisation protesters and police - everyone is anxious to make sure Qatar is not a repeat showing. Ambassadors at WTO headquarters in Geneva have been given until July to thrash out the main issues for the Qatar agenda by the WTO chief, Mike Moore. If it looks like the \"Quad\" - the EU, the US, Canada and Japan - are close to agreeing what should be on the table, Qatar will be used as a launchpad for the new round. What may have escaped the notice of the four big trading powers is that they no longer make the rules. The WTO is now dominated by developing countries, and it was largely because they became fed up with the Quad's high-handed tactics that the Seattle talks fell apart. To get them back to the negotiating table is not going to be a simple matter, and so far they are fairly unimpressed with what the Quad is offering. The EU missed a golden opportunity recently to score some relatively painless public relations points with the least developed countries under the \"everything but arms\" proposal, which was supposed to allow tariff-free access to EU markets for goods from the world's 48 least developed countries, or LDCs. The lobbyists got in first and carved out exceptions to the agreement which made it virtually worthless: 70% of its potential benefits to LDCs would have come from more liberal access for sugar, rice and beef, but liberalisation of those three goods has been deferred until 2006. The message appears to be that although Europe is committed - in theory at least - to offering poor countries a better trade deal, in practice even a tiny lobby group like the sugar beet industry can prevent it. The basic gripe of the developing world is that when it comes to trade, the west says one thing and does another. While protecting its own vulnerable sectors from competition, it demands that southern countries liberalise. The two markets of most importance to southern economies, agriculture and textiles, are among the most protected in the west. Forthcoming research from Oxfam will show the cost of trade barriers to developing countries is far higher than the amount western countries spend on official aid programmes. One recent study estimated that rich countries spend enough on subsidising their farmers to fly every single cow in the west around the world first class. That's not only a huge waste of western taxpayers' money but a huge cost to developing world countries which could be producing food for western markets more efficiently and at less cost to the environment - where land is cheaper, agriculture can be extensive rather than intensive. Subsidy-bloated lobbies The west shows no appetite to take on its subsidy-bloated producer lobbies, as the failure to unblock access to sugar, rice and beef under \"everything but arms\" shows. Although foot and mouth and BSE have sparked calls for an overhaul of the European common agricultural policy, the agenda is being driven by consumer panic over industrial farming - and the likely outcome is more subsidies, this time for environmentally approved farming methods. In the meantime, western trade barriers are costing farmers in the developing world $20bn a year. While the west protects and subsidises, the developing world is being forced to liberalise. Though global trade talks have been on hold since the end of the Uruguay round in 1994, poor countries are slashing tariff barriers under the aegis of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes. Most economists agree that in the long term countries with lower trade barriers do better, because they are exposed to global competition which makes their economies more efficient. Development experts point out that while the theory is fine, the reality is that poor countries have accomplished the kind of reductions in tariff barriers over the last decade which took the west 50 years to achieve. The adjustment costs have been painful in many cases and because the tariff cuts have been made outside a trade round, they have not even gained reciprocal market access. Divisions between the west and the developing world on trade will be clearly visible at this week's Quebec summit to launch talks on setting up a free trade area of the Americas. Mr Bush is a strong supporter of the FTAA proposal, but Latin American countries want to see Washington delivering. The Brazilian government, for one, is sceptical about the US's commitment to the free trade agenda when Washington regularly uses anti-dumping measures to block imports from its neighbours and spends $20,000 a year per farmer on subsidies. Quebec will also be the anti-globalisation lobby's first big outing for 2001. In response to the protesters, western policymakers often trot out the line that globalisation is good for the poor. The truth about globalisation is that the west is using its control of the two big financial institutions to open up poor country markets while protecting its own. The message from Brussels and Washington alike appears to be, \"you liberalise, we subsidise\". Unless the rules of the game are tilted more in favour of the developing world, Qatar and Quebec could both be re-runs of Seattle.",

All the cameras, computers and key equipment remained in their old headquarters on the other side of Moscow's huge Ostankino television complex, in the hands of the new management. The latex puppets of politicians created for the Russian version of Spitting Image were left in the NTV studios, but the satirists responsible for the programme's biting scripts were among those who fled to the other company, TNT. Some 350 staff resigned from NTV after Saturday's management coup, with almost all of the channel's best known journalists going over the road to TNT. A small group of reporters stayed with the new management, appointed in a controversial boardroom putsch almost a fortnight ago by Gazprom, the gas monopoly which is 38% controlled by the state. Both teams continued to broadcast rival versions of NTV's flagship news programme, Sevodnya (Today).

      "bodyText": "A British firm has vowed to press ahead with plans to implant genetically modified human stem cells into the brains of stroke victims, despite the severe side effects experienced by Parkinson's disease sufferers in a comparable trial in the US. The firm, ReNeuron, based in Guildford, Surrey, has been encouraged by new research on rats which suggests the animal's modified cells are capable of repairing different kinds of brain damage. In the US research, scientists drilled holes in patients' heads and inserted tiny amounts of foetal brain tissue inside, hoping they would manufacture a vital natural brain chemical, dopamine, which is depleted in Parkinson's sufferers. Early results from those trials, reported last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that while older patients were unaffected and some younger patients improved, a small number began to writhe, jerk, flail and move their jaws uncontrollably. Martin Edwards, chief executive of ReNeuron, said: \"We are quite determined to go forward into trials. \"My view of the New England Journal of Medicine paper is that it has taken the field forward. It has provided some objective evidence about both risk and benefit which is a step along the way.\" ReNeuron has yet to apply to regulators to start trials, and has not begun recruiting volunteers, but Dr Edwards said the first phase would involve eight to 12 patients who had recently suffered a stroke. He said he did not believe it would be necessary for the first trial to repeat one of the most controversial aspects of the US Parkinson's study - giving some volunteers sham surgery. To create a control group, which had not been given the grafts but believed it had, the US researchers drilled holes in all of the patients' skulls and only put foetal material in some of them. Unlike the Parkinson's trial, ReNeuron's stroke trial will use stem cells multiplied in the lab rather than fragments of foetal brain. The company claims this technique will enable it to control the amount and type of cells implanted in patients' brains more precisely. In a further control measure, ReNeuron's cells contain a temperature-sensitive gene. At laboratory temperatures of 33C they divide and multiply, but in the hotter temperatures inside the human brain - 37C to 38C - they no longer divide. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked. Of the 100,000 victims of first strokes in Britain each year, some 40,000 survive and experience varying degrees of paralysis and mental impairment. ReNeuron's research is aiming to help victims in the months immediately following a stroke, when the brain's natural repair mechanisms are struggling to put right the damage. Last week Helen Hodges, of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, told a meeting of the British Neuroscience Association that ReNeuron cells had improved movement and cognition in rats which had been given artificially-induced strokes. Dr Hodges, one of the founders of ReNeuron, and other researchers, used genetically modified mouse rather than human cells to implant into the rat's brains, but she said the results were an important proof of principle. Unexpectedly, the cells spread throughout the brain, rather than staying in one place, she said. \"The stem cells do not remain clustered in the brain, like foetal grafts, but disperse, integrate and improve function even in aged animals,\" she added. \"We expect that stem cells will prove to be far safer and more flexible for brain damage repair than primary foetal cells because they are unlikely to worsen symptoms, as recently reported in some Parkinson's patients.\"",

Britain was at the forefront of countries calling for action on third world debt and unilaterally cancelled its own loans to most indebted countries. But the chancellor feels that the World Bank and IMF cannot afford to go further without compromising their lending programmes to other poor countries. \"Countries like Bangladesh, who have a great deal of poverty, rely on the World Bank and would lose out if the Bank diverted its resources simply to wiping out debt,\" Mr Brown said in an interview with the Observer. Mr Brown, who is the chairman of the IMF's key policymaking committee, was responding to a report published last week by the Drop the Debt coalition which said the two lenders could afford to cancel the remaining $7bn (\u00a35bn) owed to them by some of the world's poorest countries. Both financial bodies granted limited debt relief last year to 22 of the most indebted countries. The campaigners say repayments have dropped by about a quarter, but most of the countries are still spending more servicing their loans to the West than on health. In the report commissioned by Drop the Debt, accountants Chantrey Vellacott argue that the World Bank could use increased reserves to wipe off a further $2.8bn of debt without compromising its triple A credit rating. The rest of the debt-cancellation money could come from revaluing a further chunk of the IMF's gold reserves to market prices, and from earnings on loans to other countries. \"The World Bank can cancel debt and continue lending to low income countries, either from its profits or if its shareholders chose, they can increase their contributions,\" said Lucy Matthew, from Drop the Debt. Mr Brown, who is preparing for IMF and World Bank meetings next week, had a stern message for protesters calling for the financial institutions to be abolished. \"The response to a global economy is greater cooperation and more involvement by the international institutions, not less,\" he said. \"Therefore the aim of the anti-globalisation [protests] to diminish the IMF and the World Bank is actually completely wrong.\"",

It seems harder and harder now to rally such faith in the future. The clock of the Long Now may seem a loopy idea, but that's the point. Perhaps inadvertently, it is a reformulation of a long Christian tradition of time-keeping. The first mechanical clocks were invented in 13th- century monasteries to assist in the measuring of their days in the sequence of services - matins, compline etc.</p> <p>Then, the purpose of marking time was focused on imagining eternity. Now it's more modest - just imagining the lives of our children's great-grandchildren. Change is only possible once people have started to see its possibility.

It seems harder and harder now to rally such faith in the future. The clock of the Long Now may seem a loopy idea, but that's the point. Perhaps inadvertently, it is a reformulation of a long Christian tradition of time-keeping. The first mechanical clocks were invented in 13th- century monasteries to assist in the measuring of their days in the sequence of services - matins, compline etc. Then, the purpose of marking time was focused on imagining eternity. Now it's more modest - just imagining the lives of our children's great-grandchildren. Change is only possible once people have started to see its possibility. Imagining a future is the first step to creating it. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

The Green party presidential candidate stood against the two main parties, arguing that there was no difference between them and that America needed an alternative. America ended up with what looks like being the most rightwing president since before the war.</p> <p>Bush didn't win the election, he won a court case. But, with the slenderest of endorsements, he promises to inflict severe damage. In Congress, many Republicans are beginning to think he is beyond the pale. Even Uncle Sam's faithful poodle, the British government, is yapping at his heels. Some in the cabinet are calling on Tony Blair to put the special relationship \"into deep freeze\". John Prescott flies to New York today to try to persuade Bush to change his mind about scrapping the Kyoto agreement on controlling greenhouse gases.</p> <p>So first, some truth. There is a difference between Bush and his Democratic challenger, Al Gore. For Nader to have claimed otherwise during his campaign was disingenuous and opportunistic. We do not know what Gore would have done by this stage had he won, but we can be quite sure it would not have been this. His first decision as president would not have been to deny aid to non-governmental organisations that support abortion overseas through surgery, counselling or lobbying. Nor would Gore have put forward a budget planning to eliminate $309m in grants to help public housing authorities get rid of drug dealers or a programme to preserve wetlands so that he could give trillions to the wealthy. And least of all would he have turned his back on the Kyoto accord.</p> <p>Now, for a consequence. If Nader had not stood, then Gore would be president. This is as close to a political fact as a statistic dares to be. True, polls showed that one-third of those who voted for Nader would otherwise not have voted at all. But it is also true that more than half of Nader's supporters would have voted for Gore, delivering him majorities in both Florida and New Hampshire and winning him the electoral college.</p> <p>For the left not to acknowledge this is spineless. If it wants to be taken seriously it must first take itself seriously. Nader stood to make a difference and he succeeded. In politics, as in life, a sign of maturity is accepting responsibility for your actions. Moreover, only once those points have been conceded is it possible to mount a credible defence of Nader's candidacy. Because Nader not only had a right to stand but was right to stand. The problem with George Bush is not that he is a vicious rightwing ideologue - the man can barely tie his shoelaces - it is that he is the paid representative of corporate America.</p> <p>It is no good challenging Bush without challenging the system that produced him - a system in which big money, not ideas, selects the candidates and then backs both sides to make sure it picks the winner. Since Gore and the Democrats were not only complicit in that system but abused it to their own ends while in office, they were incapable of taking on that task even if they had wanted to. It took an outsider. Nader alone provided a meaningful choice in what is rapidly becoming a multimillion-dollar, corporate-sponsored charade, masquerading as democracy.</p> <p>Nader was right not because there was no difference between the two main parties but because there was insufficient difference. The Democrats' pitch to potential Nader supporters was: \"At least we're not Republicans.\" The 2.7m people who voted for Nader felt they wanted more from democracy than that.</p> <p>Democrats love to blame Nader for Bush. Their logic is sloppy. Democrats deny a myriad of other far more compelling or equally tenuous factors that put Bush in the White House. They ignore the fact that, after two terms in office, they could not win Clinton's or Gore's home states. They deny that the situation was so close in Florida that any candidate who stood, including the Natural Law Party, could reasonably claim to have made the decisive difference.</p> <p>One could as well blame Theresa LePore, the election supervisor who botched the ballot papers, or Katherine Harris, the Republican secretary of state in Florida who obstructed the recounts. In such a tight race, Nader was a factor not the factor. Under such circumstances, to fixate on him as the principal reason for Gore's defeat is perverse.</p> <p>The charge also reveals astonishing political arrogance. It suggests that the Democrats have a right to the left vote regardless of what they say and do. Clinton can withdraw welfare benefits from the poor, promote a free-trade agreement (Nafta) that sells jobs to the lowest wages and weakest unions in the continent, broker global trade deals that hammer the poor or starve Iraqi children and still expect liberals to turn out for his successor.</p> <p>Democrats scream betrayal without realising that before there is betrayal there must first be friendship and trust. They demand loyalty, but show none in return. Having spent a decade distancing themselves from the left, they express shock that the left might choose to respect that distance and go it alone.</p> <p>None the less, the question of whether a principled stand against big money is best served by the practical outcome of a Bush presidency remains pertinent. The answer may change as his term progresses. For the time being, on balance, it was. For evidence look no further than Kyoto. Bush's decision to renege on the treaty is a vicious attack on the environment. But Clinton's record was not much better. He signed up to Kyoto, but he did not honour it. The US, by far the world's largest polluter, promised to cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 7% from 1990 levels by 2012. Instead, emissions rose by more than 10% on 1990 levels by 2000.</p> <p>It was thanks to Clinton's administration that last year's climate talks in the Hague collapsed. The problem was not only that he could not get the legislation through a Republican Congress, it was that he dared not take on the might of the oil and gas companies. They gave Republican candidates $10m last year; but they gave Democrats, including Gore, $4m. Bush may be in hock to them, but Clinton was in awe of them.</p> <p>But much also depends on what Nader does now. The corporate domination of American politics cannot be undermined once every four years at election time or on television-panel discussions and the lecture circuit. The truth is that it will take not just a party but a movement, joining together the disparate voices of labour unions, tree huggers and pressure groups that made themselves heard at Seattle, to make complete sense of his candidacy. Having made a difference at the polls, he must now make a difference in civil society. Only then will it be clear that the consequence of Nader's candidacy was not to derail the Democrats, but to restore democracy.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The worst problem was that her mother was almost blind and they had to guide her every step.\" At least they usually had enough to eat. \"They never starved because Cesaria went to the bars and just about made enough. Her voice saved them.\" </p> <p>Cape Verde, a group of 10 islands in the Atlantic a few hundred miles east of Senegal, is not some balmy paradise, but essentially a rocky and sandy extension of the Sahara. Evora's new album is called Sao Vicente di Longe - after the island she comes from - and its cover shows the 60-year-old singer among the dunes, in what looks like a moonscape. In one affecting photo she is carrying a cockerel and holding out two eggs to the camera, with a typically impassive expression. \"It's very bleak,\" says Evora, \"but there's a beauty in the bleakness.\" </p> <p>The same is true of Evora's music. The lush instrumentation - strings, horns and shuffling percussion - makes her songs far more enjoyable than the sometimes dirge-like Portuguese fado from which they partly derive. As a result, each of her haunting albums, such as Miss Perfumado, Cesaria and Cafe Atlantico, has had more success than the last. </p> <p>When you see her perform, she seems to move between melancholy, longing and that untranslatable bittersweet Portuguese word soudade. If the Inuits have a string of words for snow, Cesaria seems to have discovered a whole range of gradations of sadness. She sings what is known as morna, as Cape Verdean as the tango is Argentinian, only occasionally lifting the tempo with another indigenous song form, the comparatively lively coladeira. </p> <p>Last week, in what was billed as Cesaria Evora's Fiesta, she performed with other Cape Verdean groups in a 17,000-seat Lisbon arena. But if the word fiesta summons up images of bright colours and wild dancing, you'd be mistaken (Cesaria says her favourite colours are \"black, black and black\"). No one moves and it's impossible to gauge the audience's reaction. But at the end of the set they stomp and cheer and flick their lighters, and at the third encore everyone gets up and dances. </p> <p>Evora is becoming a serious global star. She has now sold 4m albums - Britain is the only European country to have resisted her. Her forthcoming American tour will include a date at the Hollywood Bowl, and an appearance on David Letterman. Madonna asked her to perform at her wedding and again for her birthday, but Evora turned her down both times. </p> <p>Backstage in Lisbon, the record company talk is of demographics, territories and \"lifestyle marketing\", which seems to mean getting the record played in restaurants. A Swedish journalist asks Evora what it is like to be known as \"the drinking and smoking grandmother of pop\". She says, reasonably enough, that lots of grandmothers drink and smoke, and in any case she's given up the whisky. Someone else wants to know why she's wearing shoes - after all, the one thing everyone knows about her is that she is the \"barefoot diva\". It turns out she has had an operation on her ankle but will return to her normal shoelessness as soon as she can. Then she sits on her own to eat a Cape Verdean buffet dinner. </p> <p>She doesn't appear to be even slightly impressed by the circus around her. Is it difficult to retain the ambience of the music in the kind of large arenas she now plays? She is still doing some of the same material that she used to as a bar singer in Cape Verde. \"I perform the same way whether it's in front of a president, a group of fishermen in a bar, or in a big concert hall.\" She exudes an almost rock-like equanimity, but then perhaps that is the best way to cope with the extremes of her life. \"I don't feel happy or sad when I sing my music, I feel myself.\" </p> <p>But she does get animated talking of Cape Verdean cooking, comparing the new album to a stew that had to be prepared using exactly the right ingredients and then shared with the world.

The qualities of that group - a ramshackle melodic sense coupled with an off-the-wall, but often touching lyricism - mainly belonged to Malkmus, and it is these that we find in his debut solo album. </p> <p>Shepherd's Bush Empire, Shepherd's Bush Green, W12 (020-7771 2000) 8pm, \u00a311. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday</strong><br><strong> Stereophonics</strong><br> </p> <p> Stereophonics represent solidity, a nice singing voice, something as reliable as a workbench. </p> <p>Ocean, Mare St, E8 (020-7314 2800) 8pm, phone for prices. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong><br><strong> Mogwai</strong><br> </p> <p> As much rock as they are post-rock, Mogwai have for each ounce of their avant-garde ambition a basic primal urge to make noise, and it's in this volatile combination that much of their genius lies. </p> <p>Shepherd's Bush Empire, Shepherd's Bush Green, W12 (020-7771 2000) 8pm, phone for prices. </p> <p><strong> Friday</strong><br><strong> Van Morrison</strong><br> </p> <p> Undoubtedly one of the greats on the strength of his work pre-1975 alone, Van Morrison nowadays cuts a stately figure, revisiting old generic stomping grounds with a surly vigour. </p> <p>Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gore, SW7 (020-7589 8212) 7.30pm, \u00a318-\u00a330. </p> <p> <strong> John Robinson</strong> </p> <p><strong>Classical</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Tuesday</strong><br><strong> Happy Birthday Igor</strong><br> </p> <p> To celebrate his 70th birthday, Igor Oistrakh plays Mendelssohn's violin concerto, just as he did at his British debut in 1953. For good measure he also throws in Beethoven's violin concerto in this concert with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. With a programme like that it doesn't look as though he has any thought of retiring. </p> <p>Barbican Hall, Barbican Centre, Silk St, EC2 (020-7638 8891) 7.30pm, \u00a310.50-\u00a328.50. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday</strong><br><strong> London Mozart Players</strong><br> </p> <p> Pascal Roge is the soloist in the brilliant second piano concerto by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, along with symphonies by Mozart and Bizet and Ravel's Mother Goose Suite. </p> <p>Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank Centre, SE1 (020-7960 4201) 7.45pm, \u00a37.50-\u00a321. </p> <p><strong> Three Evenings Festival</strong><br> </p> <p> Last of three concerts which attempt to demystify experimental music, this time with sampled bouzouki, mini-disc and voice creating a \"disturbing socio-political message\". </p> <p>Cheltenham Music Library, Chester Walk (01242-227070) 8pm, \u00a34 on the door only. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong><br><strong> Otello</strong><br> </p> <p> Elijah Moshinsky's production of Verdi's opera returns to Covent Garden with a cast that includes Jose Cura as Otello and Amanda Roocroft as Desdemona. </p> <p>Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, WC2 (020-7304 4000) 7.30pm, \u00a35-\u00a3150. </p> <p><strong> Friday</strong><br><strong> Czech Philharmonic</strong><br> </p> <p> While the LSO are busy playing as much Bohemian music as possible, along comes the Czech Philharmonic under Vladimir Ashkenazy with two programmes stuffed with Viennese and Russian classics: tonight Prokofiev's fifth symphony, tomorrow Strauss's Four Last Songs and Mahler's fifth symphony.

A nimble, agile, quick-witted, intelligent little film. </p> <p>(12) (Christopher Guest, 2000, US) Christopher Guest, Parker Posey. 90 mins **** </p> <p><strong> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon </strong><br> </p> <p> A martial arts movie in a traditional Chinese action idiom which manages to be both electrifyingly exciting and sweetly romantic. </p> <p>(15) (Ang Lee, 2000, China/US) Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi. 120 mins ***** </p> <p><strong> A Hard Day's Night </strong><br> </p> <p> Easily the best Beatles film, directed by Richard Lester who emerges as a neglected modern master, chucking the camera about with wonderful flair, capturing the sheer joy of the Fab Four in the springtime of their career. His direction is experimental, radical, surreal, suffused with endless invention and fun. And this film is a fascinating picture of the country in 1964, with the Beatles as our cheerfully anarchic heroes. </p> <p>(U) (Richard Lester, 1964, UK) The Beatles, Wilfred Brambell. 87 mins **** </p> <p><strong> Last Resort</strong><br> </p> <p> Pavlikovsky brings rigour, as well as blazing compassion, to this story of an eastern European woman and her young son, washed up in a grim seaside \"holding area\" for asylum seekers. </p> <p>(15) (Paul Pavlikovsky, 2000, UK) Dina Korzun, Paddy Considine, Artyom Strelnikov. 77 mins ***** </p> <p><strong> A One And A Two </strong><br> </p> <p> This spacious family drama is exquisitely considered, richly textured, beautifully acted, moving, funny and wise. A film about the interconnecting tribulations of one extended family in contemporary Taipei, it revolves around a man beset with problems, who meets the person he jilted when she was a schoolgirl 30 years before. (15) (Edward Yang, 2000, Taiwan/Japan) Nien-Jen Wu, Elaine Jin. 173 mins ***** </p> <p> <strong> Peter Bradshaw</strong> </p> <p><strong>If you're only going to see one thing this week...</strong></p> <p><strong> Joshua Bell, Friday</strong><br> </p> <p>For the last four years the American violinist Joshua Bell has programmed a chamber music festival at the Wigmore Hall. Tickets for this are likely to be as rare as gold dust. If you can get hold of a pair, don't let go. In this first concert Bell is accompanied by Alexander Lonquich in three Beethoven sonatas. </p> <p>Wigmore Hall, Wigmore Street, W1 (020-7935 2141) 7.30pm, \u00a310-\u00a323.</p>",

Jessica Lack Cinema Best In Show In this little gem of a comedy, director and co-writer Guest tells the story of the \"Mayflower Dog Show\", following the fraught lives of the key competitors and their tremulous, talented pooches. A nimble, agile, quick-witted, intelligent little film. (12) (Christopher Guest, 2000, US) Christopher Guest, Parker Posey. 90 mins **** Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon A martial arts movie in a traditional Chinese action idiom which manages to be both electrifyingly exciting and sweetly romantic. (15) (Ang Lee, 2000, China/US) Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi. 120 mins ***** A Hard Day's Night Easily the best Beatles film, directed by Richard Lester who emerges as a neglected modern master, chucking the camera about with wonderful flair, capturing the sheer joy of the Fab Four in the springtime of their career. His direction is experimental, radical, surreal, suffused with endless invention and fun. And this film is a fascinating picture of the country in 1964, with the Beatles as our cheerfully anarchic heroes. (U) (Richard Lester, 1964, UK) The Beatles, Wilfred Brambell. 87 mins **** Last Resort Pavlikovsky brings rigour, as well as blazing compassion, to this story of an eastern European woman and her young son, washed up in a grim seaside \"holding area\" for asylum seekers. (15) (Paul Pavlikovsky, 2000, UK) Dina Korzun, Paddy Considine, Artyom Strelnikov. 77 mins ***** A One And A Two This spacious family drama is exquisitely considered, richly textured, beautifully acted, moving, funny and wise. A film about the interconnecting tribulations of one extended family in contemporary Taipei, it revolves around a man beset with problems, who meets the person he jilted when she was a schoolgirl 30 years before. (15) (Edward Yang, 2000, Taiwan/Japan) Nien-Jen Wu, Elaine Jin. 173 mins ***** Peter Bradshaw If you're only going to see one thing this week... Joshua Bell, Friday For the last four years the American violinist Joshua Bell has programmed a chamber music festival at the Wigmore Hall. Tickets for this are likely to be as rare as gold dust.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Brightly lit at night, the giant cross looms over the divided city of Mostar - a new ethnic marker on the same clifftop where artillery rained shells on Muslim buildings in the city during the Bosnian war of the early 90s. The Christian symbol may be less lethal now but to every Muslim family here it carries just as clear a message of separateness and attempted supremacy.</p> <p>It is more than five years since the US pressed Balkan leaders at an air force base in Dayton, Ohio, to sign a peace deal for Bosnia. During that time, $5bn (\u00a33.5bn) has been pumped in to the country and 20,000 Nato-led troops are still in place trying to secure the peace.</p> <p>Yet the country is still as far from unity as it was when the guns fell silent. If the international community fails in Bosnia, Kosovo's chances are slim.</p> <p>The cross above Mostar went up only five months ago, coinciding with the start of a powerful campaign by Bosnian Croat hardliners to set up their own mini-state.</p> <p>Western governments were shocked: they had long seen Bosnia's Serbs as the fledgling country's main problem. They thought the fall of the Serb strongman next door in Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, would open a more optimistic page for Bosnia. Already in Croatia proper, a more democratic regime had arrived.</p> <p>Instead, the moves towards democracy in Serbia and Croatia have frightened and provoked their ethnic kin in Bosnia, making them more rather than less extreme.</p> <p>In elections in December, the SDS - the party of Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader in Bosnia charged with war crimes by the international tribunal at the Hague - emerged as the strongest party in Serb areas of the republic. In Bosnia's Croatian areas, the equally nationalist Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, won close to 90% of the vote.</p> <p>At least this triumph of extremism was not emulated by Bosnia's Muslims, who for the first time since the war, gave half their votes to parties with a civic rather than a nationalist agenda. But the Bosniacs, as the Muslims are known, have always had a stronger stake in a unified state with its own identity.</p> <p>They also benefit more than Serbs and Croats from the international community's huge presence in the capital, Sarajevo, providing jobs for thousands of translators, drivers and secretaries, as well as scores of programmes meant to foster a healthy civil society.</p> <p>The biggest problem is in the Serb and Croat areas, which became largely monoethnic after the wartime \"cleansing\". Under the Dayton agreement, the Serbs got a separate \"entity\" covering 49% of Bosnia. The Croats remained in a federation with the Muslims.</p> <p>The Serb entity and the Muslim-Croat federation were supposed to share central institutions in a single state. There is a Bosnian central bank, a common currency (the mark, convertible at par with the deutschmark), and common car licence plates which make it easier for people to travel with less risk of being set upon than if plates were ethnically differentiated.</p> <p>But the common political institutions, such as parliament and the three-man presidency, are not yet working to a consensus. And now even the division into two entities - the Serb one, and the Muslim-Croat one - is challenged.</p> <p>In the words of a disillusioned western diplomat, \"The Serbs got their mafia statelet. The Muslims got the country as a whole. The Croats got nothing. Instead, they were lumped with the people they like least. Now they want a statelet like the Serbs got.\" The Croats made their challenge in early March when the HDZ set up an illegal Croat parliament. They then tried to persuade Croat officers and soldiers to defect from the Muslim-Croat federation army to build up a force loyal to the separatists.</p> <p>The federation's defence minister, Mijo Anic, a moderate Croat, claimed some success last week in stemming the desertions, reporting that around three-quarters of the soldiers in central and north-eastern Bosnia had gone back to barracks. In the hardline nationalist region of Herzegovina it was less than half.</p> <p>But Nato-led peacekeepers in Bosnia said yesterday that they had begun removing weapons from several Croat-controlled barracks.</p> <p>The optimistic view on the latest events is that the Croat rebellion is a last defiant stand by the hardliners rather than the unravelling of the Dayton accords. \"This is happening because we're succeeding, not because we're failing,\" says the bullish head of the UN mission, Jacques Klein. Yet the city of Mostar is a symbol of troubled Bosnia. Depending on which side of the city they live, people pay their bills to different branches of the electricity utility and the phone company. The police and other public servants get their wages separately.</p> <p>Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian diplomat who is the international community's high representative, recently started to go after the real source of the nationalists' power - their money. After five years of trying to build up civic institutions in the hope that democratic forces would vote the extremists out, the new strategy is to hit the wealth that helps the militants secure support.</p> <p>Ten days ago federal police raided Hercegovacka Banka, a new bank set up by leaders of the HDZ in Mostar and other cities, and took control of it.</p> <p>The international peacekeeping force, S-For, failed to provide enough protection, with the result that several auditors were taken hostage and threatened by Croat thugs. But computer hard disks and other documentation were seized, and this may allow fraud charges to be brought.

      "bodyText": "Brightly lit at night, the giant cross looms over the divided city of Mostar - a new ethnic marker on the same clifftop where artillery rained shells on Muslim buildings in the city during the Bosnian war of the early 90s. The Christian symbol may be less lethal now but to every Muslim family here it carries just as clear a message of separateness and attempted supremacy. It is more than five years since the US pressed Balkan leaders at an air force base in Dayton, Ohio, to sign a peace deal for Bosnia. During that time, $5bn (\u00a33.5bn) has been pumped in to the country and 20,000 Nato-led troops are still in place trying to secure the peace. Yet the country is still as far from unity as it was when the guns fell silent. If the international community fails in Bosnia, Kosovo's chances are slim. The cross above Mostar went up only five months ago, coinciding with the start of a powerful campaign by Bosnian Croat hardliners to set up their own mini-state. Western governments were shocked: they had long seen Bosnia's Serbs as the fledgling country's main problem. They thought the fall of the Serb strongman next door in Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, would open a more optimistic page for Bosnia. Already in Croatia proper, a more democratic regime had arrived. Instead, the moves towards democracy in Serbia and Croatia have frightened and provoked their ethnic kin in Bosnia, making them more rather than less extreme. In elections in December, the SDS - the party of Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader in Bosnia charged with war crimes by the international tribunal at the Hague - emerged as the strongest party in Serb areas of the republic. In Bosnia's Croatian areas, the equally nationalist Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, won close to 90% of the vote. At least this triumph of extremism was not emulated by Bosnia's Muslims, who for the first time since the war, gave half their votes to parties with a civic rather than a nationalist agenda. But the Bosniacs, as the Muslims are known, have always had a stronger stake in a unified state with its own identity. They also benefit more than Serbs and Croats from the international community's huge presence in the capital, Sarajevo, providing jobs for thousands of translators, drivers and secretaries, as well as scores of programmes meant to foster a healthy civil society. The biggest problem is in the Serb and Croat areas, which became largely monoethnic after the wartime \"cleansing\". Under the Dayton agreement, the Serbs got a separate \"entity\" covering 49% of Bosnia. The Croats remained in a federation with the Muslims. The Serb entity and the Muslim-Croat federation were supposed to share central institutions in a single state. There is a Bosnian central bank, a common currency (the mark, convertible at par with the deutschmark), and common car licence plates which make it easier for people to travel with less risk of being set upon than if plates were ethnically differentiated. But the common political institutions, such as parliament and the three-man presidency, are not yet working to a consensus. And now even the division into two entities - the Serb one, and the Muslim-Croat one - is challenged. In the words of a disillusioned western diplomat, \"The Serbs got their mafia statelet. The Muslims got the country as a whole. The Croats got nothing. Instead, they were lumped with the people they like least. Now they want a statelet like the Serbs got.\" The Croats made their challenge in early March when the HDZ set up an illegal Croat parliament. They then tried to persuade Croat officers and soldiers to defect from the Muslim-Croat federation army to build up a force loyal to the separatists. The federation's defence minister, Mijo Anic, a moderate Croat, claimed some success last week in stemming the desertions, reporting that around three-quarters of the soldiers in central and north-eastern Bosnia had gone back to barracks. In the hardline nationalist region of Herzegovina it was less than half. But Nato-led peacekeepers in Bosnia said yesterday that they had begun removing weapons from several Croat-controlled barracks. The optimistic view on the latest events is that the Croat rebellion is a last defiant stand by the hardliners rather than the unravelling of the Dayton accords. \"This is happening because we're succeeding, not because we're failing,\" says the bullish head of the UN mission, Jacques Klein. Yet the city of Mostar is a symbol of troubled Bosnia. Depending on which side of the city they live, people pay their bills to different branches of the electricity utility and the phone company. The police and other public servants get their wages separately. Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian diplomat who is the international community's high representative, recently started to go after the real source of the nationalists' power - their money. After five years of trying to build up civic institutions in the hope that democratic forces would vote the extremists out, the new strategy is to hit the wealth that helps the militants secure support. Ten days ago federal police raided Hercegovacka Banka, a new bank set up by leaders of the HDZ in Mostar and other cities, and took control of it. The international peacekeeping force, S-For, failed to provide enough protection, with the result that several auditors were taken hostage and threatened by Croat thugs. But computer hard disks and other documentation were seized, and this may allow fraud charges to be brought. Through the Hercegovacka Banka, the HDZ was able to control salaries and loyalties, as well as allegedly creaming off part of people's pensions or earning interest on delayed payments. If Mr Petritsch and his team win this struggle they will have given a big boost to Croat moderates. International officials are repeatedly exposing the hardliners for robbing their own people. The snag is that even the moderates are not always what they seem. International officials and the western governments backing them have spent four years using various regulations to exclude nationalists from power and to cultivate moderate prime ministers in the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska. But these western-backed men, operating from the town of Banja Luka, have generally proved no less corrupt and just as obstructive of Bosnian unification as the nationalists. The main signs of hope since the signing of the Dayton agreement in November 1995, are that openness and debate in each community are gaining ground. The press is bolder and more willing to tackle corruption and criticise leaders. More refugees are also returning to their home areas even if it means going back to places where a different ethnic group is in charge. Four years after Dayton, more than 800,000 Bosnians were still internally displaced, with another 300,000 living as refugees abroad. Only 100,000 had gone back to homes in areas where their ethnic group was a minority. Now the pace of \"minority returns\" is picking up, international administrators say, with 8,000 in the first two months of this year. Most are elderly and seen as no threat, but numbers increasingly include young people in cities. Enforcement of the new property laws, which allow people to reclaim their flats, has helped, as have the officials' efforts to arrange swaps. Admir, a Muslim journalist in Mostar, recently moved back with his wife and small children to his old flat in a tower block in the Croat side of the city. It had been occupied by a Croat family who fled from Muslims in central Bosnia, but in recent times went home. \"I have had no trouble from our neighbours,\" he says. \"Most people are all right. They get manipulated by their leaders.\" Asked about schooling when his children are a little older, he says: \"We're not yet sure. I want them to be taught the history of this country, not just the Croat version.\" Worrying about syllabuses rather than survival is progress of a sort. \u0095 A former Bosnian Serb army commander wanted in connection with the worst massacre of the Bosnian war was arrested yesterday in northern Bosnia. Dragan Obrenovic is to be sent to the Hague tribunal for trial. He has been questioned about the killings in Srebrenica, which fell to Serb forces in July 1995. Some 7,000 Muslims are believed to have been executed afterwards. Related special reports: Serbia Kosovo Macedonia",

An FBI memorandum delivered in 1965, 18 months after the killings, said: \"The bombing was the handiwork of former Klansmen Robert E Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Frank Cash and Thomas E Blanton jr.\" Blanton is said to have driven his '57 Chevy to the church and waited with the others while \"Dynamite Bob\" Chambliss set the bomb. Chambliss was eventually found guilty in 1977, dying in jail eight years later; Cash died without ever facing a jury; Cherry might never come to trial now; which leaves only Blanton, a chip off the old racist block, son of Pops Blanton, a notorious Birmingham white supremacist. Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Centre, says that racist groups are not exactly rallying to the Blanton cause. \"Even if you believe in racial separation, it's difficult to get behind the murder of four little girls. It's also a trial from another era. It's like trying a Nazi war criminal.\" That era was one in which blacks, now Afro-Americans, were referred to as negroes in polite society; when freelance bigots performed the role in which today police in cities such as New York, Los Angeles - and now Cincinnati - are cast. There was no direct reference during the Sixteenth Street Easter service to the bombing so long ago, but a reading from Luke 23:24 might have been taken as one: \"And Jesus said: 'Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.'\"",

So, asks  Simon Hattenstone, where did it all go wrong?</p>",
      "byline": "Simon Hattenstone",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I'm expecting Stan Collymore any second. Well, I think I'm expecting Collymore. People have warned me. You can't rely on him. Tread carefully, don't get on his wrong side, take a minder. His agent tells me, unnecessarily, that I'll recognise Stan - he's a very, very big man. </p> <p>Collymore was an outstanding footballer - fast, strong, skilful, it once seemed he could make anything happen when he put his mind to it. He should be one of the great British players of his era. Instead, he's regarded as the biggest screw-up of his generation. Stan the Man became Bad Boy Stan, Stan the Vandal and now Stan the Loser. At 30, he should be peaking. Instead he has just retired. People have compared him with Paul Gascoigne, but at least Gascoigne got his 50 plus caps for England. The more appropriate comparison is with George Best. Like Best, Collymore was, and still is, beautiful, and like Best he had a very serious problem. With Best it was drink, with Collymore it was depression. He lost his energy, lost his will to win, hit out at the world, and most famously hit out at his celebrity girlfriend, Ulrika Jonsson. His career went into freefall. </p> <p>Collymore arrives at the grand Birmingham hotel on the dot of 10.30am. He shakes hands. His hands are soft, small for his size. His legs are huge, and bend in all directions like a clay model. He says last night he watched his first match in ages - Liverpool vs Barcelona. \"Not just since retirement, but in a long time. I wanted to watch the Liverpool game because obviously it's a massive game, and I played for them...\" He joined Liverpool for \u00a38.5m in 1995, the record British transfer fee at the time. In his first game, he scored a wonder goal. His first season was successful. By the second he was depressed and had fallen out with the management. Collymore always seemed to fall out with management. </p> <p>Does he miss football? \"No, not really. I'm spending a lot more time with the family, my little boy and fiance. Tom's five and into all sorts.\" </p> <p>Collymore and his partner, Estelle, have just moved into a new house in Cannock, a tiny working-class town in the Midlands where he has lived most of his life. His mum lives down the road, her parents live down the road, their best friends live down the road. He's always been a bit of a home boy. There were angry stories emanating from Liverpool about how half-hearted he was because he never moved there. Why should he have uprooted, he says, when he was only an hour's drive away? </p> <p>Collymore came up the hard way. Rejected after six months as an apprentice, he clawed his way back through Crystal Palace and Southend, before a \u00a32m transfer to Nottingham Forest. There, he scored at a phenomenal rate (45 goals in 78 games), and the fans loved him. But even then there were problems. When his fellow players appeared not to congratulate him for scoring a goal, it blew into a big story. \"In the press you have your goodies and baddies, and I guess I've been portrayed as a baddie. On one or two occasions, I guess, rightly so, but I think there's been a lot of real rubbish talked.\" </p> <p>His decline was alarming. By the end, his was a great talent every club wanted rid of. Does he feel he threw it all away? \"No,\" he says adamantly. \"As a kid I set myself three targets. To be a professional footballer, which I was for 10-12 years. To play for Aston Villa, the club I supported as a kid, and I did. How many kids who support a team actually get out and play for them? And I wanted to play for England. Again, I didn't get 50 caps, but I got three and one was against Brazil.\" How can you call that failure, he asks? </p> <p>But, of course, you can, and most of us have done. A man of his ability winning three England caps. \"I always find people who do criticise are middle-aged, pot-bellied, really scruffy hacks, and I think to myself: how on earth have you got the nerve?\" I hold my belly in. He has a point, though. We do tend to judge success in absolutes. </p> <p>In writing his football obituary, many commentators suggested that ultimately Collymore didn't love the game enough. He scorns the very notion. \"It's typical football manager spiel. There is not a person on this planet that loves playing football more than I do.\" He criticises few of his colleagues by name, but he can never forgive the Aston Villa manager John Gregory for the way he reacted to his depression. </p> <p>He points to other problems with the game. The fact that so many young players get so much, so early, for instance. \"Kids now, if they show promise at 16, are getting contracts for five years and at the end of those five years they could retire without having to achieve anything.\" Although he's all of 30, much the same could be said of him. Collymore is such a complicated creature. The vulnerable small-town boy mixed in with the super-ego run wild. It's strange to hear him talking about the erosion of standards like a grand old man of the game. It can sound hypocritical - after all, he benefited as much as anyone from the mad money, and he was not exactly famous for knowing his place. But it does make a confused sort of sense. He wanted figures to look up to, and when he didn't find them, he lost it. </p> <p>He says the way football is run is shambolic. \"You have to have no qualifications whatsoever to be a football manager. At Liverpool, I said what other industry do you know that would buy an asset for \u00a38.5m and not know how to utilise it properly, and I got absolutely slaughtered for saying that.\" Managing talented, vulnerable kids requires a sophisticated mind, he says. </p> <p>Dodgy managers, ropy decisions, bad press, a mercenary football culture: Collymore has suffered from all of them. But in the end it was his character, or his illness, that did for him. </p> <p>Most footballers grew up with dads who patted them on the back whenever they succeeded, growled at them when they failed. Collymore was brought up by his mum who told him to play for pleasure. He talks about his time at Crystal Palace as a youngster, when all the seasoned pros relentlessly mocked his brummie monotone. They all seemed so hard. \"I think you get hurt because when you play football as a kid, all the teams you play in, they're all mates. I worked in a completely non-jealous, 100% productive environment as a young footballer.\" He says he had no idea that the dressing room would be so hostile. \"It can be so bitchy, a player walks out of the dressing room, and it's 'he's a fucking tosser, he is', or 'he's a wanker, he is', and he comes back in the dressing room and it's 'all right, mate, all right, brilliant'.\" You wonder whether this 6ft 3in bruiser was too sensitive for professional football. He says whenever people meet him for the first time, they are surprised. What do they expect him to be like? \"I suppose... ignorant, unintelligent, ultra-aggressive, greedy, all of those things.\" </p> <p>It was at Aston Villa in 1999, after a \u00a37m transfer, that Collymore first announced he was depressed. His career at Liverpool had fizzled out. At Villa, it never really took off. In June 1998 he was involved in a shocking public assault on his then celebrity girlfriend, Ulrika Jonsson. He punched her in the face in a public bar. What made it worse was that it came a couple of months after Ulrika had cheered after Collymore had been cleared in court of assaulting the mother of his child. There were other stories. The papers dragged up the time he was cleared of assaulting two men in Cannock. The tabloids claimed he was a serial abuser. </p> <p>Collymore apologised straight after the incident, said it was unforgivable. In every interview he has given since then he has apologised. He also claims that, despite the allegations, he has never hit another woman. One of the most disturbing stories reported an alleged attack on his girlfriend, Estelle, in which he allegedly knocked her unconscious after finding her chatting to another man in their flat. </p> <p>\"Yes, Estelle. Estelle really wanted to go the full distance against the Sun.\" Estelle is now his fiancee. So why didn't he sue? \"Your first reaction is, right, I'm going to take them to court and say, you come and prove this. Then you've got two years going through the courts, whereas in two weeks the story's probably gone. Then in two years it will be there for all to see again. Our families are very close. We know the reality of the situation. They're in the wrong, we're in the right. We're close, we've been together for six years, we've got a baby on the way, we've moved into a new home, we're very happy, so why rock the boat for ourselves, just to give them another week's worth of news two years down the line?\" </p> <p>He never used to be so phlegmatic. He says he used to be desperate to avenge himself, however petty the accusation. Even when a radio commentator criticised him. \"I always wanted to react to it, phone the radio stations, and talk to the geezer and say 'you're talking absolute bollocks here'. Now I just let them have their say.\" </p> <p>He had a breakdown in 1999. Doctors told him that it had been three years in the making. He realised, in retrospect, that even during those giddy times at Liverpool, he had felt terrible. \"It was like an ongoing joke with one mate. He said, 'You're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, you've just scored two goals, you've got people dripping off you, and you look the most miserable man I've ever seen'. And I didn't have an answer. If my leg had been hanging off, I could say, well, my leg's hanging off, but I didn't have a clue what it was.\" </p> <p>Collymore spent three weeks in the Priory, followed by a few months as a day patient. John Gregory told him to pull his socks up. \"He said, 'My idea of someone who's depressed is the woman living on the 20th floor flat with 10 kids'. Yeah, that may well be the case. But just as the Queen can get cancer like the bloke who sweeps the road, so a footballer can get depression.\" Collymore tells me of a Sun leader dedicated to him. \"It said the Sun says to all Aston Villa's brilliant fans kick this fool out out of football; how can he be depressed when he's earning x amount? And that's the national newspaper that's purporting to represent a fair chunk of British views. Again, I think it's that white, middle-aged, hard-core football mentality.\" </p> <p>What does he mean? Well, he says, look at how alcoholism is treated in football. \"Ninety nine percent of football managers are white, working-class blokes. They grew up with football and alcohol. You can be an alcoholic and get sent to prison and be welcomed back for your strength of character in English football. But if you suffer from an illness that millions suffer from, one of the only illnesses in which people take their own lives, you're called spineless and weak.\" </p> <p>And yet, he says, he'd walk out on the streets and strangers would tap him on the shoulder, commiserate and say, \"my Nan had that, or my sister had depression\". </p> <p>What did he actually feel like? \"With me it was very physical. I was drained. My body and mind was like a flat battery. I had nothing left. Couldn't concentrate, couldn't get motivated. People think any kind of mental distress - straitjacket and you're loony and you're talking crap, the Black Adder thing, two pencils up your nose, and you're talking wibble. But I was just very tired mentally. The brain wasn't fresh enough to make the body do all those real things with conviction or motivation.\" </p> <p>The night before he went to hospital, he told Estelle he couldn't go on. Was he thinking of killing himself? \"Well, not really in terms of going to jump under a tube...\" He trails off. </p> <p>In hospital, he was treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy. I ask him if he met loads of celebrities at the Priory, and he says that's a misconception. \"A lot of the referrals there are NHS ones. People think of it as a celebrity hangout, but it's a psychiatric hospital. In a nutshell, there's a depression unit, eating disorders unit and addictions unit. People think you go in there saying, 'Oh, poor me', while eating grapes and caviar. Believe me, it's not like that at all.\" By the time he left hospital he had re-evaluated his life. He was upbeat, determined not to be too hard on himself, or others, again. But his football went down the pan. </p> <p>By the end, he says, he had fallen out of love with football and fallen back in love with life. He wanted to be with Estelle and Tom, and his mates from Cannock. \"I heard Tony Adams say the other day that he's not had the time through his football commitments to always be with his kids. At what price? What price?\" </p> <p>It sounds such a clearcut decision, but it wasn't. Who knows what priority family would have had if he'd been preparing for Liverpool's match against Barcelona? Although he had eased up on himself, he admits, \"I was thinking, shit, I should still be at Liverpool, not at Bradford or Oviedo or whatever\". </p> <p>But he was also thinking that perhaps he had never really fitted into the world of football. Collymore wasn't particularly academic at school (four O-levels without trying) but he was bright and inquisitive. As a grown-up footballer, he liked reading the broadsheets and watching Newsnight, and he didn't get much change from his colleagues. </p> <p>He calls himself a Blairite, streaked with a few old Labour priorities. \"I'd like to see some degree of national control over the utilities. We need more balance between the private and public sector.\" He says his values come from Cannock. \"I've always said I don't mind paying whatever tax as long as you can see there's genuine tangible benefits to people; not people who want to sit around doing bugger all, all day, but people who genuinely can't get out of the poverty trap: for schools, for social services.\" </p> <p>Most successful footballers aren't interested in politics, he says, because it is irrelevant to their lives. \"Like I say, football is a cocoon. Everything is done for you. This is ball-signing day, and you have your lunch ready after training, and you forget there's a whole world out there.\" </p> <p>Collymore doesn't rule out a comeback, but nor does he plan one. He says there are so many things to do, none of them involving playing football. First, there's the election. He'd love to canvas in Cannock, tell people how important it is to vote. He could be a great asset to the Labour party, but he must know they would regard him as a liability. </p> <p>There have been stories suggesting he's off to Hollywood to be the new Vinnie Jones. Collymore laughs. \"I told a Spanish paper, tongue in cheek, that I wanted to be the first black James Bond.\" No, he doesn't want to act. But he has started up a television production company, which he hopes will make light entertainment programmes and documentaries. \"Real documentaries, none of this reality TV where they make a celebrity of someone just dragged in off the street.\" He says one of the advantages of owning the production company is that he can control the product. Again, he knows that owning the production company may be the only way of fulfilling an ambition of presenting on television. His history will follow him around for a long time yet. </p> <p>He says he's already been approached a couple of times for TV work, but an offer has never quite materialised. \"I know there'll be obstacles. There's the perception, and the Ulrika Jonsson thing.\" He pauses, frustrated. With the world? With himself? It's hard to tell. \"It was three years ago. Yes it was something that happened ... it was five seconds of my life three years ago. Am I going to have to talk about this every time? Believe it or not, I've got a hell of a lot more to talk about.\" As he leaves, I notice his nails for the first time. They are bitten to the quick.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I'm expecting Stan Collymore any second. Well, I think I'm expecting Collymore. People have warned me. You can't rely on him. Tread carefully, don't get on his wrong side, take a minder. His agent tells me, unnecessarily, that I'll recognise Stan - he's a very, very big man. Collymore was an outstanding footballer - fast, strong, skilful, it once seemed he could make anything happen when he put his mind to it. He should be one of the great British players of his era. Instead, he's regarded as the biggest screw-up of his generation. Stan the Man became Bad Boy Stan, Stan the Vandal and now Stan the Loser. At 30, he should be peaking. Instead he has just retired. People have compared him with Paul Gascoigne, but at least Gascoigne got his 50 plus caps for England. The more appropriate comparison is with George Best. Like Best, Collymore was, and still is, beautiful, and like Best he had a very serious problem. With Best it was drink, with Collymore it was depression. He lost his energy, lost his will to win, hit out at the world, and most famously hit out at his celebrity girlfriend, Ulrika Jonsson. His career went into freefall. Collymore arrives at the grand Birmingham hotel on the dot of 10.30am. He shakes hands. His hands are soft, small for his size. His legs are huge, and bend in all directions like a clay model. He says last night he watched his first match in ages - Liverpool vs Barcelona. \"Not just since retirement, but in a long time. I wanted to watch the Liverpool game because obviously it's a massive game, and I played for them...\" He joined Liverpool for \u00a38.5m in 1995, the record British transfer fee at the time. In his first game, he scored a wonder goal. His first season was successful. By the second he was depressed and had fallen out with the management. Collymore always seemed to fall out with management. Does he miss football? \"No, not really. I'm spending a lot more time with the family, my little boy and fiance. Tom's five and into all sorts.\" Collymore and his partner, Estelle, have just moved into a new house in Cannock, a tiny working-class town in the Midlands where he has lived most of his life. His mum lives down the road, her parents live down the road, their best friends live down the road. He's always been a bit of a home boy. There were angry stories emanating from Liverpool about how half-hearted he was because he never moved there. Why should he have uprooted, he says, when he was only an hour's drive away? Collymore came up the hard way. Rejected after six months as an apprentice, he clawed his way back through Crystal Palace and Southend, before a \u00a32m transfer to Nottingham Forest. There, he scored at a phenomenal rate (45 goals in 78 games), and the fans loved him. But even then there were problems. When his fellow players appeared not to congratulate him for scoring a goal, it blew into a big story. \"In the press you have your goodies and baddies, and I guess I've been portrayed as a baddie. On one or two occasions, I guess, rightly so, but I think there's been a lot of real rubbish talked.\" His decline was alarming. By the end, his was a great talent every club wanted rid of. Does he feel he threw it all away? \"No,\" he says adamantly. \"As a kid I set myself three targets. To be a professional footballer, which I was for 10-12 years. To play for Aston Villa, the club I supported as a kid, and I did. How many kids who support a team actually get out and play for them? And I wanted to play for England. Again, I didn't get 50 caps, but I got three and one was against Brazil.\" How can you call that failure, he asks? But, of course, you can, and most of us have done. A man of his ability winning three England caps. \"I always find people who do criticise are middle-aged, pot-bellied, really scruffy hacks, and I think to myself: how on earth have you got the nerve?\" I hold my belly in. He has a point, though. We do tend to judge success in absolutes. In writing his football obituary, many commentators suggested that ultimately Collymore didn't love the game enough. He scorns the very notion. \"It's typical football manager spiel. There is not a person on this planet that loves playing football more than I do.\" He criticises few of his colleagues by name, but he can never forgive the Aston Villa manager John Gregory for the way he reacted to his depression. He points to other problems with the game. The fact that so many young players get so much, so early, for instance. \"Kids now, if they show promise at 16, are getting contracts for five years and at the end of those five years they could retire without having to achieve anything.\" Although he's all of 30, much the same could be said of him. Collymore is such a complicated creature. The vulnerable small-town boy mixed in with the super-ego run wild. It's strange to hear him talking about the erosion of standards like a grand old man of the game. It can sound hypocritical - after all, he benefited as much as anyone from the mad money, and he was not exactly famous for knowing his place. But it does make a confused sort of sense. He wanted figures to look up to, and when he didn't find them, he lost it. He says the way football is run is shambolic. \"You have to have no qualifications whatsoever to be a football manager. At Liverpool, I said what other industry do you know that would buy an asset for \u00a38.5m and not know how to utilise it properly, and I got absolutely slaughtered for saying that.\" Managing talented, vulnerable kids requires a sophisticated mind, he says. Dodgy managers, ropy decisions, bad press, a mercenary football culture: Collymore has suffered from all of them. But in the end it was his character, or his illness, that did for him. Most footballers grew up with dads who patted them on the back whenever they succeeded, growled at them when they failed. Collymore was brought up by his mum who told him to play for pleasure. He talks about his time at Crystal Palace as a youngster, when all the seasoned pros relentlessly mocked his brummie monotone. They all seemed so hard. \"I think you get hurt because when you play football as a kid, all the teams you play in, they're all mates. I worked in a completely non-jealous, 100% productive environment as a young footballer.\" He says he had no idea that the dressing room would be so hostile. \"It can be so bitchy, a player walks out of the dressing room, and it's 'he's a fucking tosser, he is', or 'he's a wanker, he is', and he comes back in the dressing room and it's 'all right, mate, all right, brilliant'.\" You wonder whether this 6ft 3in bruiser was too sensitive for professional football. He says whenever people meet him for the first time, they are surprised. What do they expect him to be like? \"I suppose... ignorant, unintelligent, ultra-aggressive, greedy, all of those things.\" It was at Aston Villa in 1999, after a \u00a37m transfer, that Collymore first announced he was depressed. His career at Liverpool had fizzled out. At Villa, it never really took off. In June 1998 he was involved in a shocking public assault on his then celebrity girlfriend, Ulrika Jonsson. He punched her in the face in a public bar. What made it worse was that it came a couple of months after Ulrika had cheered after Collymore had been cleared in court of assaulting the mother of his child. There were other stories. The papers dragged up the time he was cleared of assaulting two men in Cannock. The tabloids claimed he was a serial abuser. Collymore apologised straight after the incident, said it was unforgivable. In every interview he has given since then he has apologised. He also claims that, despite the allegations, he has never hit another woman. One of the most disturbing stories reported an alleged attack on his girlfriend, Estelle, in which he allegedly knocked her unconscious after finding her chatting to another man in their flat. \"Yes, Estelle. Estelle really wanted to go the full distance against the Sun.\" Estelle is now his fiancee. So why didn't he sue? \"Your first reaction is, right, I'm going to take them to court and say, you come and prove this. Then you've got two years going through the courts, whereas in two weeks the story's probably gone. Then in two years it will be there for all to see again. Our families are very close. We know the reality of the situation. They're in the wrong, we're in the right. We're close, we've been together for six years, we've got a baby on the way, we've moved into a new home, we're very happy, so why rock the boat for ourselves, just to give them another week's worth of news two years down the line?\" He never used to be so phlegmatic. He says he used to be desperate to avenge himself, however petty the accusation. Even when a radio commentator criticised him. \"I always wanted to react to it, phone the radio stations, and talk to the geezer and say 'you're talking absolute bollocks here'. Now I just let them have their say.\" He had a breakdown in 1999. Doctors told him that it had been three years in the making. He realised, in retrospect, that even during those giddy times at Liverpool, he had felt terrible. \"It was like an ongoing joke with one mate. He said, 'You're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, you've just scored two goals, you've got people dripping off you, and you look the most miserable man I've ever seen'. And I didn't have an answer. If my leg had been hanging off, I could say, well, my leg's hanging off, but I didn't have a clue what it was.\" Collymore spent three weeks in the Priory, followed by a few months as a day patient. John Gregory told him to pull his socks up. \"He said, 'My idea of someone who's depressed is the woman living on the 20th floor flat with 10 kids'. Yeah, that may well be the case.

      "body": "<p>It is reported in the current issue of Jane's International Defence Review that the age of the tank is finally drawing to a close. The announcement, actually made some weeks ago by Britain's Master General of the Ordnance, Major General Peter Gilchrist, was that, by 2025, when the current models have run their time, the 70-ton main battle tank will have had its day.</p> <p>These remarks echo announcements that have been coming out of the Pentagon for a number of years. The tank is dead not because war is over, as some fondly imagined after the iron curtain came down in 1989, but because the basis of warfare has been transformed. If the future belongs to lighter weapons systems, this is partly because war is less likely to be between massed armies, as was envisaged in the cold war scenarios.</p> <p>Instead, the military is reorganising itself around an idea that the Americans call \"force projection\" - a kind of fly-swatting operation in which western powers can expect to pour in to some benighted place from a safe distance, deliver the necessary impact and then get out, preferably as fast as they came. You can't do that with a tank force like the one that went to Iraq in 1991 and was two months in transit.</p> <p>The tank has been fighting off suggestions of redundancy ever since the first world war, when the first models were invented by the British to overcome the lethal stasis of trench warfare. The machine is, after all, a contradiction in terms. It is a platform that must combine three partially contradictory parameters: firepower, mobility and protection. The heavier a tank is, the less mobile it is likely to be, and vice versa.</p> <p>Every nation that has designed a tank has its own \"tank triangle\", shaped according to the priorities placed on the respective parameters. Technological advances are now making that balancing act seem unnecessary. If you can fire off a whole battery of missiles instantaneously, why have a single gun that needs to be rotated and aimed each time? And why weigh yourself down with tons of armour when you can achieve protection by other means, perhaps by switching on a heavy magnetic field?</p> <p>And yet there is another side to the history of this weapon, which may be more visible to civilians than to the spooky prophets of new age warfare. The tank may be a practical instrument of modern warfare, but in the eyes of the many people who have had to face it since 1916, it is more like a monster, a hideous throwback to the age of the dinosaurs, an expression of the most primitive kind of power. It is less a practical instrument with known capabilities than a phantasm, which can compel by its mere appearance.</p> <p>In US military circles, this aspect of the tank is recognised as the \"shock effect\". But in the very early days of the tank it was known as the \"moral effect\" - the power of the machine to compel merely by appearing on the scene - as if the end of the world had arrived on a pair of groaning caterpillar tracks.</p> <p>When the first tanks were shipped to the western front they were met with laughter. In London theatres, dancing girls were soon performing the \"Tanko\". The symbolic dimension of the tank was accepted as part of its military power. This fact was recognised by the French and British during the first world war, and afterwards exploited in many, often colonial, locations.</p> <p>The representative tank of the late 20th century was not actually the latest digitised machine equipped with \"total situational awareness\". It is more like the one that forms the closing image of Don Delillo's novel Mao II. This is a graffiti-ridden but still apocalyptic rattletrap, grinding along at the head of a wedding party carousing its way through the eerie ruins of Beirut - \"an old T-34, some scarred and cruddy ancient, sold and stolen two dozen times, changing sides and systems and religions\".</p> <p>Hi-tech Abrams and Challengers were seen in action during Operation Desert Storm, but elsewhere the tank has remained a grinding, primitive thing, serving as a prop for murderous warlords like the late Serbian butcher Arkan, or a handy implement for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who use tanks to erase ancient Buddhas from their landscape, or for pushing over walls on to men found guilty of homosexuality.</p> <p>And it is not just for the Taliban that the tank has continued to work as a primitive monster. It has long functioned as the embodiment of state power, lined up against its own civilians. And in this capacity, it has never been excessively reliant on technological sophistication. All that matters is that it scares the hell out of the unarmed onlooker.</p> <p>This side of the tank's history does not consist of planned battles in which tanks advanced en masse, as at Cambrai or Amiens in the first world war, and later in Hitler's Blitzkrieg operations of the second world war, or in the massive clashes in which tank army met tank army, as at Kursk in 1943. Instead, it opens with events such as occurred in 1919: in Glasgow, where the British government used tanks to overawe socialist strikers; in Ireland, where British tanks were used repeatedly against the struggle for independence; or in Berlin, where captured British tanks were used to suppress the Spartacus uprising.</p> <p>This version of \"tank warfare\" would later be practised in the Soviet bloc: in the East Berlin uprising of 1953, when tanks were confronted by protesting citizens; in Budapest in 1956; in Prague in 1968, and in Poland during martial law. Its history includes the events of July 1967, when American tanks were used against rioters on the near west side of Detroit, and of all too many coups. They were on the streets in Athens during the colonels' coup of 1967; when Pinochet launched his coup against Allende's elected Popular Unity government in Chile in 1973; and when President Marcos ordered them out in Manila in 1986, against nuns, priests and children who eventually overwhelmed them.</p> <p>This civilian image of the tank, in which the excesses of diverse CIA-prompted coups are symbolically wedded to those of the unyielding communist state, was repeated most memorably in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

      "bodyText": "It is reported in the current issue of Jane's International Defence Review that the age of the tank is finally drawing to a close. The announcement, actually made some weeks ago by Britain's Master General of the Ordnance, Major General Peter Gilchrist, was that, by 2025, when the current models have run their time, the 70-ton main battle tank will have had its day. These remarks echo announcements that have been coming out of the Pentagon for a number of years. The tank is dead not because war is over, as some fondly imagined after the iron curtain came down in 1989, but because the basis of warfare has been transformed. If the future belongs to lighter weapons systems, this is partly because war is less likely to be between massed armies, as was envisaged in the cold war scenarios. Instead, the military is reorganising itself around an idea that the Americans call \"force projection\" - a kind of fly-swatting operation in which western powers can expect to pour in to some benighted place from a safe distance, deliver the necessary impact and then get out, preferably as fast as they came. You can't do that with a tank force like the one that went to Iraq in 1991 and was two months in transit. The tank has been fighting off suggestions of redundancy ever since the first world war, when the first models were invented by the British to overcome the lethal stasis of trench warfare. The machine is, after all, a contradiction in terms. It is a platform that must combine three partially contradictory parameters: firepower, mobility and protection. The heavier a tank is, the less mobile it is likely to be, and vice versa. Every nation that has designed a tank has its own \"tank triangle\", shaped according to the priorities placed on the respective parameters. Technological advances are now making that balancing act seem unnecessary. If you can fire off a whole battery of missiles instantaneously, why have a single gun that needs to be rotated and aimed each time? And why weigh yourself down with tons of armour when you can achieve protection by other means, perhaps by switching on a heavy magnetic field? And yet there is another side to the history of this weapon, which may be more visible to civilians than to the spooky prophets of new age warfare. The tank may be a practical instrument of modern warfare, but in the eyes of the many people who have had to face it since 1916, it is more like a monster, a hideous throwback to the age of the dinosaurs, an expression of the most primitive kind of power. It is less a practical instrument with known capabilities than a phantasm, which can compel by its mere appearance. In US military circles, this aspect of the tank is recognised as the \"shock effect\". But in the very early days of the tank it was known as the \"moral effect\" - the power of the machine to compel merely by appearing on the scene - as if the end of the world had arrived on a pair of groaning caterpillar tracks. When the first tanks were shipped to the western front they were met with laughter. In London theatres, dancing girls were soon performing the \"Tanko\". The symbolic dimension of the tank was accepted as part of its military power. This fact was recognised by the French and British during the first world war, and afterwards exploited in many, often colonial, locations. The representative tank of the late 20th century was not actually the latest digitised machine equipped with \"total situational awareness\". It is more like the one that forms the closing image of Don Delillo's novel Mao II. This is a graffiti-ridden but still apocalyptic rattletrap, grinding along at the head of a wedding party carousing its way through the eerie ruins of Beirut - \"an old T-34, some scarred and cruddy ancient, sold and stolen two dozen times, changing sides and systems and religions\". Hi-tech Abrams and Challengers were seen in action during Operation Desert Storm, but elsewhere the tank has remained a grinding, primitive thing, serving as a prop for murderous warlords like the late Serbian butcher Arkan, or a handy implement for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who use tanks to erase ancient Buddhas from their landscape, or for pushing over walls on to men found guilty of homosexuality. And it is not just for the Taliban that the tank has continued to work as a primitive monster. It has long functioned as the embodiment of state power, lined up against its own civilians. And in this capacity, it has never been excessively reliant on technological sophistication. All that matters is that it scares the hell out of the unarmed onlooker. This side of the tank's history does not consist of planned battles in which tanks advanced en masse, as at Cambrai or Amiens in the first world war, and later in Hitler's Blitzkrieg operations of the second world war, or in the massive clashes in which tank army met tank army, as at Kursk in 1943. Instead, it opens with events such as occurred in 1919: in Glasgow, where the British government used tanks to overawe socialist strikers; in Ireland, where British tanks were used repeatedly against the struggle for independence; or in Berlin, where captured British tanks were used to suppress the Spartacus uprising. This version of \"tank warfare\" would later be practised in the Soviet bloc: in the East Berlin uprising of 1953, when tanks were confronted by protesting citizens; in Budapest in 1956; in Prague in 1968, and in Poland during martial law. Its history includes the events of July 1967, when American tanks were used against rioters on the near west side of Detroit, and of all too many coups. They were on the streets in Athens during the colonels' coup of 1967; when Pinochet launched his coup against Allende's elected Popular Unity government in Chile in 1973; and when President Marcos ordered them out in Manila in 1986, against nuns, priests and children who eventually overwhelmed them. This civilian image of the tank, in which the excesses of diverse CIA-prompted coups are symbolically wedded to those of the unyielding communist state, was repeated most memorably in Tiananmen Square in 1989. PLA tanks crushed demonstrators, and the abiding image was created a day or two later when a single civilian stepped into a deserted boulevard and arrested a whole column of approaching tanks. The fact that this apparently primitive imagery can overwhelm even the most sophisticated hardware is suggested by the case of Israel, which has designed its own tank, albeit using huge subventions of US money. The Merkava was designed in the 80s, after the Yom Kippur war of 1973, in which the over-confident Israeli Tank Corps suffered grievious losses as they came up against Egyptian soldiers equipped with hand held \"Sagger\" anti-tank missiles. The Merkava was to be the ultimate tank. It has phenomenal powers and an innovative design whereby its whole mechanism, including the fuel, is wrapped around the crew as protection. But what is Israel doing with its tanks? Using them as primitive monsters to oppress more or less unarmed Palestinians, turning them against stone-throwing youths, or driving them into the concentration camp known as the Gaza Strip to crush Palestinian huts. Tank symbolism can recoil on its users.

The right celebrates the John of Gaunt tradition, which isolates sovereign England set in a silvery sea. Both schools stultify.</p> <p>Because Britain's popular history became fixated with Germany on the telly, it has lost sight of the wider story. It has collapsed into, first, a western-Euro-centric and, then, an insular view of our past. Britain's director's-chair-warriors seem to have forgotten that 1939-45 was a world war - and, for Britain, an imperial one. The Blitz was a rare British excitement. But that was a domestic affair - with the home front discovering alfresco sex in the blackout. For Britain as a great power, the war that mattered was the one in the Middle East and the Far East with its consequences for Palestine and Burma, for India, Hong Kong and Singapore. Concentration on western Europe both flatters the British contribution to the European war and ignores the wider imperial collapse.</p> <p>The 20th century in Europe was determined by what happened in the east as the Teuton pushed against the Slav. That is the thousand-year story which finished off the thousand-year Reich. The obsessive thrust determined the end of the first world war and it also sealed the fate of Hitlerite Germany. This was a greater and bloodier drama even than the one fought out in the Normandy landings.</p> <p>Britain's failure to manage the transition from imperial power to European state has been influenced by films and documentaries that distort and, now, bore. The amnesiac view forgets, for example, how Angles and Saxons are themselves Germanic races. Inspect the average German physical specimen and you will find distressingly little evidence of difference from the English model. The boring joke that the royal family are Germans forgets that that is what makes them a good racial fit for English rule.</p> <p>Right up until the 1920s it was Germany, not France, that was the approved English cultural model. The clich\u00e9d view that the Germans were an inherently authoritarian race - whose craving for Ordnung could be traced back to Luther - is one that comes out of the two wars. But who led the way in inventing a welfare state long before Lloyd George? It was Bismarck - and his combination of welfarist capitalism and state subsidies was the model for 20th-century western Europe. </p> <p>Moreover, for most of modern British history, it was France and not Germany that was seen as the dangerously expansionist power. France was the country that had a tradition of military strong men seizing power by coup d'\u00e9tat. Germany by contrast was the land of a regulated parliamentary liberty which seemed to flatter England by imitation.</p> <p>British television has succeeded in presenting national socialism as the quintessence of Germany's sick soul rather than an aberration. But it's also hopeless at understanding fascism as a family collection of nasty doctrines. In Spain it looked back to the 12th-century Christian Reconquista. In Italy it only became anti-Semitic in the mid-30s, and many Jews were active supporters of Mussolini in the 20s. In Romania it had the local trade of vampirism to feed its ideology. These peculiarities escape the telly historian obsessed by Hitlerism.</p> <p>One serious result of the distorting complacence is that it obscures what was, for Britain, the most important result of the war: its emergence as an American colony. Here is a real subject of illusion and reality. No one spoke of a special relationship before the second world war, and the uniqueness lay in the extent of the debt Britain had to shoulder, at American insistence, in order to pay for the war from 1941. For Britain these are more pregnant issues than whether Hitler fancied his niece for coprophiliac purposes.</p> <p>Self-congratulatory snootiness about the war being won is now a turn-off. Not being invaded was an important fact as well as something of an accident. An invaded Britain would have been rather like any other European country: a few shits on the make, a lot of looking the other way and a few brave souls. </p> <p>For the French, the occupation was a boon - it prompted a national debate about guilt, identity and responsibility. It also produced great art of spiritual depth in the films of Robert Bresson and of Marcel Carne. Olivier's vulgar Henry V and the hideous class consciousness of Coward's In Which We Serve embarrass by comparison. </p> <p>Germany - transfigured by a terrible purgation - emerged redeemed, democratised and rich in a new self-consciousness and humility. Would that the same were true of Britain - now most insecure of all European countries, squalid in her infrastrucure, clinging to the vestiges of a meaningless sovereignty, subservient to a death-row specialist ensconced in the White House by electoral fraud. As we switch off and allow the dead to bury the dead - our period of self-examination is only just beginning. Would that we had the film-makers to offer a history that helps rather than hinders that process.</p>",

But that was a domestic affair - with the home front discovering alfresco sex in the blackout. For Britain as a great power, the war that mattered was the one in the Middle East and the Far East with its consequences for Palestine and Burma, for India, Hong Kong and Singapore. Concentration on western Europe both flatters the British contribution to the European war and ignores the wider imperial collapse. The 20th century in Europe was determined by what happened in the east as the Teuton pushed against the Slav. That is the thousand-year story which finished off the thousand-year Reich. The obsessive thrust determined the end of the first world war and it also sealed the fate of Hitlerite Germany. This was a greater and bloodier drama even than the one fought out in the Normandy landings. Britain's failure to manage the transition from imperial power to European state has been influenced by films and documentaries that distort and, now, bore. The amnesiac view forgets, for example, how Angles and Saxons are themselves Germanic races. Inspect the average German physical specimen and you will find distressingly little evidence of difference from the English model. The boring joke that the royal family are Germans forgets that that is what makes them a good racial fit for English rule. Right up until the 1920s it was Germany, not France, that was the approved English cultural model. The clich\u00e9d view that the Germans were an inherently authoritarian race - whose craving for Ordnung could be traced back to Luther - is one that comes out of the two wars. But who led the way in inventing a welfare state long before Lloyd George? It was Bismarck - and his combination of welfarist capitalism and state subsidies was the model for 20th-century western Europe. Moreover, for most of modern British history, it was France and not Germany that was seen as the dangerously expansionist power. France was the country that had a tradition of military strong men seizing power by coup d'\u00e9tat. Germany by contrast was the land of a regulated parliamentary liberty which seemed to flatter England by imitation. British television has succeeded in presenting national socialism as the quintessence of Germany's sick soul rather than an aberration. But it's also hopeless at understanding fascism as a family collection of nasty doctrines. In Spain it looked back to the 12th-century Christian Reconquista. In Italy it only became anti-Semitic in the mid-30s, and many Jews were active supporters of Mussolini in the 20s. In Romania it had the local trade of vampirism to feed its ideology. These peculiarities escape the telly historian obsessed by Hitlerism. One serious result of the distorting complacence is that it obscures what was, for Britain, the most important result of the war: its emergence as an American colony. Here is a real subject of illusion and reality. No one spoke of a special relationship before the second world war, and the uniqueness lay in the extent of the debt Britain had to shoulder, at American insistence, in order to pay for the war from 1941. For Britain these are more pregnant issues than whether Hitler fancied his niece for coprophiliac purposes. Self-congratulatory snootiness about the war being won is now a turn-off. Not being invaded was an important fact as well as something of an accident. An invaded Britain would have been rather like any other European country: a few shits on the make, a lot of looking the other way and a few brave souls. For the French, the occupation was a boon - it prompted a national debate about guilt, identity and responsibility. It also produced great art of spiritual depth in the films of Robert Bresson and of Marcel Carne. Olivier's vulgar Henry V and the hideous class consciousness of Coward's In Which We Serve embarrass by comparison. Germany - transfigured by a terrible purgation - emerged redeemed, democratised and rich in a new self-consciousness and humility. Would that the same were true of Britain - now most insecure of all European countries, squalid in her infrastrucure, clinging to the vestiges of a meaningless sovereignty, subservient to a death-row specialist ensconced in the White House by electoral fraud. As we switch off and allow the dead to bury the dead - our period of self-examination is only just beginning. Would that we had the film-makers to offer a history that helps rather than hinders that process.",

      "body": "<p>There has never been a theatre critic whose column consisted purely of jokes about the presumed idiots who ran the National and the RSC. Nor has any reviewer of the visual arts made a reputation entirely through punning on the names of the impressionists. In the criticism of television, however, neither of the equivalent careers would seem at all odd. </p> <p>This is because commentary on the small screen is the only branch of arts criticism that frequently proceeds from the position that most of the products are rubbish. And, like a lapsed Catholic making jokes about the Pope, television self-hatingly adds to the calumnies whenever the medium considers itself. With the exception of self-glorying awards ceremonies, analysis of television by TV generally consists of giggling compilations of the art form falling on its arse (It'll Be Alright On The Night, TV's Biggest Blunders, TV Hell.) </p> <p>A welcome exception is Ball Breakers On The Box (Channel 4), the glibly alliterative title of which disguises a thoughtful exploration of television's depiction of women. It helps that this is a rare case of an archive-based show inspired by something greater than the desire to provide nostalgic programming for viewers who grew up with 70s TV. Hamish Mykura's film marks the 30th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, but deals with the subject of employment equality through the entertainment most easily available to people when they came in from work. </p> <p>Did television drama and comedy offer equal opportunities? Most of those watching the programme will suspect that the television of the past was probably sexist but, even so, some of the evidence supporting this proposition still shocks. A 1970s sketch from The Two Ronnies - fantasising about a world run entirely by women - now seems almost pathologically misogynist. Diana Dors as a bigger-busted Thatcher presides over a society in which Feminazi stormtroopers in black leather march through the streets, the lingering shots of their bottoms hinting at a single possible consolation for the chaps if this ever happened. </p> <p>Even when less surprising, the programme is still neat, showing, for example, how professionally successful women on screen were always shown as manless but desperate to possess one, the clear implication being that no bloke wanted to be on the job with a woman who had one.

      "bodyText": "There has never been a theatre critic whose column consisted purely of jokes about the presumed idiots who ran the National and the RSC. Nor has any reviewer of the visual arts made a reputation entirely through punning on the names of the impressionists. In the criticism of television, however, neither of the equivalent careers would seem at all odd. This is because commentary on the small screen is the only branch of arts criticism that frequently proceeds from the position that most of the products are rubbish. And, like a lapsed Catholic making jokes about the Pope, television self-hatingly adds to the calumnies whenever the medium considers itself. With the exception of self-glorying awards ceremonies, analysis of television by TV generally consists of giggling compilations of the art form falling on its arse (It'll Be Alright On The Night, TV's Biggest Blunders, TV Hell.) A welcome exception is Ball Breakers On The Box (Channel 4), the glibly alliterative title of which disguises a thoughtful exploration of television's depiction of women. It helps that this is a rare case of an archive-based show inspired by something greater than the desire to provide nostalgic programming for viewers who grew up with 70s TV. Hamish Mykura's film marks the 30th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, but deals with the subject of employment equality through the entertainment most easily available to people when they came in from work. Did television drama and comedy offer equal opportunities? Most of those watching the programme will suspect that the television of the past was probably sexist but, even so, some of the evidence supporting this proposition still shocks. A 1970s sketch from The Two Ronnies - fantasising about a world run entirely by women - now seems almost pathologically misogynist. Diana Dors as a bigger-busted Thatcher presides over a society in which Feminazi stormtroopers in black leather march through the streets, the lingering shots of their bottoms hinting at a single possible consolation for the chaps if this ever happened. Even when less surprising, the programme is still neat, showing, for example, how professionally successful women on screen were always shown as manless but desperate to possess one, the clear implication being that no bloke wanted to be on the job with a woman who had one. The sex-crazed matrons of Hattie Jacques in Carry On films gave way to Mollie Sugden in Are You Being Served? There's always the risk of taking sit-com too seriously, but the male writers of that show can also be accused of having a heavy agenda considering the department store's senior female, Mrs Slocombe, was given not only a surname referring to delay in reaching orgasm but a cat as a domestic companion, allowing the now-notorious weekly references to her need to get home so that she could stroke her pussy.

He played 254 games for Rangers, scored 24 goals - and made it from supernova to black hole in one momentous decade.</p> <p>Baxter's talent was utterly natural, recalling Arthur Ashe's words about a similarly blessed tennis contemporary, Ilie Nastase. \"Ilie doesn't have to practise,\" said Ashe. \"He already has all the shots. The rest of us have to work like mules on our technique. All he has to do is keep himself fit enough to play.\"</p> <p>It was all Baxter needed, but it was too much to ask. In the early stages of an international career that would bring him 34 caps between 1961 and 1967, Dave Mackay, another great Scottish wing half, counselled him to train hard and not to pursue the wild lifestyle. The advice fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>When Baxter arrived at Ibrox on \u00a322 per week plus bonuses - the same rate as the other Rangers squad players - the first thing he did was buy a Jaguar, for no other reason than to attract the women who would be as integral a part of his life as football itself. From his earliest days at Ibrox, he would be seen in the shower in the mornings, sucking on peppermints - trying to rid himself of the effects of serious drinking even before training began.</p> <p>It was a habit that he neither regretted nor defended. \"I did it all because I liked it,\" he always said. Philandering, drinking and gambling being the short route to financial chaos, Baxter wasted no time in getting to the terminus. \"I reckon I've done in \u00a3500,000,\" he said recently. That is a conservative estimate, considering the rate at which his cash was squandered over a 30-year period.</p> <p>Perhaps his background as a pit-boy lay at the core of this impulsive behaviour. He was born in Hill o' Beath, Fife, and on leaving school spent eight months as an apprentice cabinet-maker before taking the cage to the place that Jock Stein called \"the darkest place on earth\".</p> <p>Stein, himself a miner from Lanarkshire, said \"there's nothing as dark as the darkness down a pit, the blackness that closes in on you if your lamp goes out. You'd think you would see some kind of shapes but you can see nothing, nothing but the inside of your head. I think everybody should go down the pit at least once to learn what darkness is.\"</p> <p>Baxter's emergence into the light, when he became a full-time footballer, had been preceded by a short spell with the Fife junior team, Crossgates Primrose, and he joined Raith Rovers as a part-timer in 1957. He spent two years on national service with the Black Watch before signing for Rangers for a Scottish record transfer fee. His first match was a League Cup tie against Partick Thistle in August 1960, in which he played at inside left.</p> <p>That November he scored his first goal for Rangers, against Clyde. In 1961, Rangers won the league championship and were runners-up in the European Cup Winners' Cup. That year too Baxter debuted for his country against Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In 1963 he was part of Rangers' double-winning team. But, even at the height of his greatest triumphs, his sense of mischief could not be suppressed. When Scotland beat England 2-1 at Wembley in 1963, Baxter scored twice on his first appearance at the great stadium as the visitors were reduced to 10 men when left back Eric Caldow broke a leg. Baxter admitted to being tempted to put one into his own net near the end so that he could claim a hat-trick.</p> <p>The following year Rangers won the league title and the Scottish and league cups, but in May 1965 he moved to Sunderland for \u00a372,500. The late Scot Symon, the Rangers manager who had taken him to Ibrox, knew even then that he was on the way down. After 98 games and 12 goals, in December 1967 Baxter was sold for \u00a3100,000 to Nottingham Forest, where he numbered another sporting giant, Gary Sobers, among his closest friends. A further 50 appearances for the midlands club was followed by a free transfer back to Rangers.</p> <p>In 1967, when the Scots inflicted England's first defeat as world champions, Baxter's incomparable touch on the ball allowed him not only to humiliate the home side, but also to concoct a plan with Billy Bremner to give Alan Ball a bad experience.

None of the greatest players of the era would argue with his right to be there.</p> <p>After his retirement he applied for, and was given, a publican's licence. In 1994, he had two liver transplants.

Throughout this time, there were only two short months without such LRDG patrols.</p> <p>Formed in July 1940, under the command of Major Ralph Bagnold, a notable prewar desert explorer - and brother of the writer Edith Bagnold - the group's task was to reconnoitre the great Libyan desert on the western border of Egypt and the Sudan.</p> <p>The unit, initially equipped with Ford trucks, which were later replaced by 30cwt Chevrolets, ranged freely across north Africa, travelling hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to gather information for the 8th Army. Its troops, many of them tough Rhodesians and New Zealanders, were adept at navigating the desert by the stars-and-sun compass. They were experts in maintaining their vehicles, driving in the sand, conserving water and \"reading the tracks\". As Lloyd Owen put it, \"you hardly ever saw a track of a vehicle. And if you did we knew exactly who had made them, 1920s Bagnold's cars, or ourselves. We could read those tracks.\"</p> <p>The Special Air Service, formed in November 1941, came to rely on the LRDG to deliver its parties to their objectives and, when necessary, recover them. But while the LRDG, with a reputation for professionalism and reliability, worked closely with the SAS, it was first and foremost a reconnaissance and intelligence unit. It could and did inflict considerable damage on the enemy, but this was not its primary function.</p> <p>Born in Hampton, Middlesex, Lloyd Owen was the son of a Royal Navy captain. After Winchester College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1938, and saw service in Palestine during the Arab revolt. With the second world war and the Italian army's move towards Mersa Matruh, the Queen's was sent to Egypt in December 1940, where Lloyd Owen saw action as a company commander at Sidi Barrani and Tobruk.</p> <p>But by the late spring of 1941, Lloyd Owen, much to his chagrin, found himself posted back to Cairo as an instructor at the Middle East officer cadet training unit. The existence of the LRDG was kept as quiet as possible, but Lloyd Owen heard about it from a Guards officer friend - and applied. He was interviewed by Bagnold, who \"asked me questions to which I had no answer, I knew so little\". Despite rating his chances of acceptance as \"nil\" because he knew nothing about vehicles and had little knowledge of the desert, he impressed Bagnold sufficiently to be taken on trial and was given command of Yeomanry Patrol, made up of men from the dismounted Yeomanry of the 1st Cavalry Division, whom Lloyd Owen described as \"25 men of jolly good yeomanry regiments and a few commandos who were without a role in the Middle East\".</p> <p>A man of normally immaculate appearance, Lloyd Owen began to blend in with his informal and often decidedly scruffy comrades. To command the special type of soldier who served with the LRDG required a special type of officer. Lloyd Owen's relaxed and friendly style of leadership relied on persuasion, personal example and the recognition of shared hardships. He won the loyalty and respect of his men by his daring, sheer stamina and first-rate tactical skills.</p> <p>Awarded an MC for his part in the joint raid on Tobruk by the LRDG and SAS in September 1942, he was severely wounded shortly afterwards in an air raid on Kufra, the LRDG's main base, but was fit enough to rejoin his unit for the final stages of the north Africa campaign. By May 1943, the LRDG was in Lebanon, training for a new role in mountain warfare, but was then unexpectedly posted to the Aegean. During the battle for Leros, the commanding officer was killed, and Lloyd Owen was appointed to command.</p> <p>Based in Bari, in southern Italy, the LRDG, under Lloyd Owen, mounted a successful raid on Corfu as well as operations in the Dalmatian islands and Yugoslavia, eventually parachuting into Albania in September 1944. The drop had taken place at night and, shortly after landing, Lloyd Owen fell 30ft into a ravine, badly damaging his spine. Although treated in a field by an LRDG doctor specially parachuted in, Lloyd Owen was in continual pain, but despite this managed to direct a number of successful operations in the mountains.</p> <p>Eventually evacuated to Italy, he was operated on and, notwithstanding orders to desist from operations, managed to wangle his way back to Albania, although this time he went by sea. For his leadership in the Balkans, Lloyd Owen was awarded the DSO in 1945 and mentioned in dispatches.</p> <p>Following a period on the War Office's military operations staff, in 1948-49 he was appointed military assistant to the high commissioner in Malaya at the height of the emergency. For his work there he was awarded an OBE and again mentioned in dispatches. From 1957 to 1959 he commanded his own regiment, the 1st Battalion the Queen's Royal Regiment, in Germany, before joining the staff at Sandhurst.</p> <p>During the Radfan campaign of the early 1960s, he commanded 24 Infantry Group in Kenya and Aden.</p> <p>In 1968-69 he was general officer commanding, Near East Land Forces, and from 1969 until his retirement with the rank of major-general in 1972, president of the Regular Commissions Board. He was appointed CB in 1971.</p> <p>In later life, Lloyd Owen, who made his home in Norfolk, was chairman of the Wildflowers Association of Great Britain and also of a charitable trust devoted to helping disabled people and those with learning difficulties to take part in sailing and other pastimes on the Broads. He published two memoirs, The Desert My Dwelling Place (1957) and Providence Their Guide (1980), and was, for more than 50 years, chairman of the LRDG Association.</p> <p>His wife, whom he married in 1947, survives him together with their three sons. A man of great charm, Lloyd Owen was a courageous soldier and a remarkable leader of men.</p> <p>\u0095 David Lanyon Lloyd Owen, soldier, born October 10 1917; died April 5 2001</p>",

Its troops, many of them tough Rhodesians and New Zealanders, were adept at navigating the desert by the stars-and-sun compass. They were experts in maintaining their vehicles, driving in the sand, conserving water and \"reading the tracks\". As Lloyd Owen put it, \"you hardly ever saw a track of a vehicle. And if you did we knew exactly who had made them, 1920s Bagnold's cars, or ourselves. We could read those tracks.\" The Special Air Service, formed in November 1941, came to rely on the LRDG to deliver its parties to their objectives and, when necessary, recover them. But while the LRDG, with a reputation for professionalism and reliability, worked closely with the SAS, it was first and foremost a reconnaissance and intelligence unit. It could and did inflict considerable damage on the enemy, but this was not its primary function. Born in Hampton, Middlesex, Lloyd Owen was the son of a Royal Navy captain. After Winchester College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1938, and saw service in Palestine during the Arab revolt. With the second world war and the Italian army's move towards Mersa Matruh, the Queen's was sent to Egypt in December 1940, where Lloyd Owen saw action as a company commander at Sidi Barrani and Tobruk. But by the late spring of 1941, Lloyd Owen, much to his chagrin, found himself posted back to Cairo as an instructor at the Middle East officer cadet training unit. The existence of the LRDG was kept as quiet as possible, but Lloyd Owen heard about it from a Guards officer friend - and applied. He was interviewed by Bagnold, who \"asked me questions to which I had no answer, I knew so little\". Despite rating his chances of acceptance as \"nil\" because he knew nothing about vehicles and had little knowledge of the desert, he impressed Bagnold sufficiently to be taken on trial and was given command of Yeomanry Patrol, made up of men from the dismounted Yeomanry of the 1st Cavalry Division, whom Lloyd Owen described as \"25 men of jolly good yeomanry regiments and a few commandos who were without a role in the Middle East\". A man of normally immaculate appearance, Lloyd Owen began to blend in with his informal and often decidedly scruffy comrades. To command the special type of soldier who served with the LRDG required a special type of officer. Lloyd Owen's relaxed and friendly style of leadership relied on persuasion, personal example and the recognition of shared hardships. He won the loyalty and respect of his men by his daring, sheer stamina and first-rate tactical skills. Awarded an MC for his part in the joint raid on Tobruk by the LRDG and SAS in September 1942, he was severely wounded shortly afterwards in an air raid on Kufra, the LRDG's main base, but was fit enough to rejoin his unit for the final stages of the north Africa campaign. By May 1943, the LRDG was in Lebanon, training for a new role in mountain warfare, but was then unexpectedly posted to the Aegean. During the battle for Leros, the commanding officer was killed, and Lloyd Owen was appointed to command. Based in Bari, in southern Italy, the LRDG, under Lloyd Owen, mounted a successful raid on Corfu as well as operations in the Dalmatian islands and Yugoslavia, eventually parachuting into Albania in September 1944. The drop had taken place at night and, shortly after landing, Lloyd Owen fell 30ft into a ravine, badly damaging his spine. Although treated in a field by an LRDG doctor specially parachuted in, Lloyd Owen was in continual pain, but despite this managed to direct a number of successful operations in the mountains. Eventually evacuated to Italy, he was operated on and, notwithstanding orders to desist from operations, managed to wangle his way back to Albania, although this time he went by sea. For his leadership in the Balkans, Lloyd Owen was awarded the DSO in 1945 and mentioned in dispatches. Following a period on the War Office's military operations staff, in 1948-49 he was appointed military assistant to the high commissioner in Malaya at the height of the emergency. For his work there he was awarded an OBE and again mentioned in dispatches. From 1957 to 1959 he commanded his own regiment, the 1st Battalion the Queen's Royal Regiment, in Germany, before joining the staff at Sandhurst. During the Radfan campaign of the early 1960s, he commanded 24 Infantry Group in Kenya and Aden. In 1968-69 he was general officer commanding, Near East Land Forces, and from 1969 until his retirement with the rank of major-general in 1972, president of the Regular Commissions Board. He was appointed CB in 1971. In later life, Lloyd Owen, who made his home in Norfolk, was chairman of the Wildflowers Association of Great Britain and also of a charitable trust devoted to helping disabled people and those with learning difficulties to take part in sailing and other pastimes on the Broads. He published two memoirs, The Desert My Dwelling Place (1957) and Providence Their Guide (1980), and was, for more than 50 years, chairman of the LRDG Association. His wife, whom he married in 1947, survives him together with their three sons. A man of great charm, Lloyd Owen was a courageous soldier and a remarkable leader of men. \u0095 David Lanyon Lloyd Owen, soldier, born October 10 1917; died April 5 2001",

      "bodyText": "France may not be alone in seeking the extradition from America of Francisco Arce Montez, the alleged serial sex offender suspected of murdering the British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson in a Brittany youth hostel five years ago. Judicial sources confirmed yesterday that Montez, a Spanish restaurant worker being held in a Miami jail on suspicion of sex offences, is also wanted for at least four rapes and attempted rapes in Germany and Spain. \"He also spent quite some time in the Netherlands and in Britain. It is by no means impossible that he may be linked to as yet unsolved sex crimes in those countries too,\" said a French justice official who asked not to be named. Scientists at the Paris police laboratory this weekend found 18 points of similarity between a sample of the waiter's DNA supplied by US police and traces found on Caroline's body. The 13-year-old was raped and suffocated in her first-floor room at the Pleine-Foug\u00e8res hostel on July 18, 1996. Under French law, nine points of similarity are enough for a suspect to be placed under formal investigation, the step before being charged. One genetic fingerprinting expert said yesterday that the possibility of Montez not being Caroline's killer was \"something like one in 6bn\". French police confirmed they had drawn up an international arrest warrant for Montez, 51, which would be sent to the US judicial authorities via Interpol in the next couple of days. But a formal request to start a more complex extradition process will take much longer and may be hindered by similar efforts from other countries. The Spaniard has now been linked with a string of sex offences committed around Europe in the past 20 years. His first conviction, for exhibitionism, was in Bremen, Germany, in 1980. He was subsequently found guilty in his absence of the attempted rape of two hitchhikers in T\u00fcbingen in 1988, and sentenced to two years in jail. In 1993 and 1994, French gendarmes twice had to release Montez for lack of evidence after he was accused of trying to force Irish schoolgirls into his Dutch-registered car near the Chateau de la Herserie, a youth activity centre in central France popular with Irish tourists. The inquiry into the murder of Caroline also revealed that a man answering his description had been spotted outside Brittany youth hostels in Saint-Brieuc, Saint-Malo and Antrain in June and July 1996. On the night of her killing, another British schoolgirl, Kate Wrigley, narrowly escaped being raped in a hostel at nearby Saint-Lunaire. In September of that year, a British waitress was attacked by a man resembling Montez in a hotel in Beauvoir, northern France. In late 1997, Montez jumped bail and disappeared after being detained for an attempted rape in Llanes, not far from his birthplace in Gijon, in Spain's Asturias region. He arrived in the US in February this year and was arrested in Miami on March 13 for burglary and lewd behaviour.",

As it rises up over the City skyline, the tower tapers. The top is a cone. This reduces the visual bulk of what is, by any standards, a massive building. In addition, in wind-tunnel tests the shape proved to be aerodynamically efficient. This may not seem important - office blocks, after all, are not expected to fly - yet it is.

Air currents will be drawn into vents spun gently up and through the office floors. Since the windows will open (a real luxury for today's office workers), the Foster tower will therefore rely to a very limited degree on air-conditioning. Stale air will be exhausted into the tower's spiralling atria, or \"sky gardens\", where it will be re-oxygenated by trees and plants. The Swiss-Re will be as permeable as an emmenthal cheese.</p> <p>Because the building will need little in the way of air-con equipment, its roof will be glazed and entirely free of the usual unsightly clutter. In fact, the top floors are to be a glamorous restaurant and bar. At this stage there can be no guarantee that these will be open to the public, but Swiss-Re is working on the idea. Let's hope it happens. Otherwise, public access will be via a two-floor shopping gallery at the base of the tower, which will rise from a new public plaza with trees, all-year open-air cafes and low walls designed to double up as benches. In summer, the walls of the tower above them will open up like some giant pinecone as windows lever outwards.
