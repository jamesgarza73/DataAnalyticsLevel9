But Weah credits his football upbringing to a more familiar personality, the man he says was like a father to him, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. </p> <p>The Arsenal manager took Weah under his wing when, in 1988, he arrived at Monaco young and raw from Africa. And Weah has never forgotten it. </p> <p>\"It was one of the best things for me, meeting Ars\u00e8ne,\" he says. \"It was very difficult for me in the first two months. I was getting a lot of criticism and I was tempted to go back because it was so cold. </p> <p>\"But he gave me confidence. He told me, 'look, you are a good player. Just work hard and you will make it. You are fast and have the technical skills. You just need to work on the tactical'. So he worked with me on the training pitch, he taught me the European mentality and also how to be a professional. </p> <p>\"A lot of African players had come to Europe and did not make a good career because they were hanging out, going to the disco, coming back in the morning. Ars\u00e8ne did not stop me going out but told me what my priorities were. </p> <p>\"Ars\u00e8ne did a lot for me and is responsible for my career today. So I say thanks to Ars\u00e8ne, and I always smile when I say that because he did such a great job for me.\" </p> <p>There was speculation that Wenger might be interested in taking Weah on loan to Arsenal. But Milan only offered him Marseille or Chelsea as options after making it clear he was surplus to their requirements. </p> <p>The snub hurt him after five happy years at the San Siro, but he had suffered worse. \"My mother and father had a problem and they abandoned me and my brother when I was one and my brother two.\" </p> <p>The young Weahs were handed to grandma Emma who brought them up in a country torn by civil war. When, at the age of 19, George was offered a playing contract in nearby Cameroon he took it for one reason. \"My grandmother was doing everything for me, so I decided to give a helping hand to my family because they offered me $30,000 (\u00a318,900) to go to Cameroon. </p> <p>\"I said I'll go and give the money to my grandmother.

      "body": "<p>So, when Allan Donald walks on to the field at Centurion for the final Test starting today, will it be the last hurrah for a great fast bowler? Time catches up with them all and Donald is no exception. </p> <p>He is 33 now and his body is creaking. The left ankle that has absorbed the impact of 13,216 Test-match deliveries gives him gip and every hamstring twinge feels like another piece is falling off. </p> <p>Stung, one can bet, by the notion that Shaun Pollock is ranked the world's leading bowler, he has conjured 22 wickets this series, where his partner, with 16, has been unable. If his new-ball work has been lacklustre at times then some of his later spells have been inspirational. Maybe he has not been at his absolute best but second best for Donald is better than most. </p> <p>Donald is South African cricket. He has played in 60 of the 67 matches since his country's return to Test cricket at Bridgetown in April 1992 when he was already 25. In that time he has taken 290 wickets and the lure of claiming the 10 that will take him to the magic 300 mark in Tests, even if it does not influence his retirement decision, is tantalising. </p> <p>It may, after the next few days, no longer be an issue, for Centurion in its four-year history as a Test ground has become Donald's killing fields: he took two for 92 in the only innings of the rain-spoilt inaugural Test against England there but since then a further 22 in three matches at 12.73 (24 at 15.5 overall), including three five-wicket hauls.

      "bodyText": "So, when Allan Donald walks on to the field at Centurion for the final Test starting today, will it be the last hurrah for a great fast bowler? Time catches up with them all and Donald is no exception. He is 33 now and his body is creaking. The left ankle that has absorbed the impact of 13,216 Test-match deliveries gives him gip and every hamstring twinge feels like another piece is falling off. Stung, one can bet, by the notion that Shaun Pollock is ranked the world's leading bowler, he has conjured 22 wickets this series, where his partner, with 16, has been unable. If his new-ball work has been lacklustre at times then some of his later spells have been inspirational. Maybe he has not been at his absolute best but second best for Donald is better than most. Donald is South African cricket. He has played in 60 of the 67 matches since his country's return to Test cricket at Bridgetown in April 1992 when he was already 25. In that time he has taken 290 wickets and the lure of claiming the 10 that will take him to the magic 300 mark in Tests, even if it does not influence his retirement decision, is tantalising. It may, after the next few days, no longer be an issue, for Centurion in its four-year history as a Test ground has become Donald's killing fields: he took two for 92 in the only innings of the rain-spoilt inaugural Test against England there but since then a further 22 in three matches at 12.73 (24 at 15.5 overall), including three five-wicket hauls. Pollock's record there by comparison is six wickets at 32 apiece in three matches. Ten in the match for Donald is a distinct possibility, not least because his second-innings record at Centurion - 11 at 8.9 with two of them five-wicket hauls - is phenomenal. There will be no respite for England later in the game. To assist him Donald will have what Nasser Hussain described yesterday as \"a pitch with a good covering of white grass.

      "body": "<p>Multinational businessman Karlheinz Schreiber, whose donation disclosures are at the root of the scandal rocking German politics, is one of the most intriguing figures to have been thrust into the floodlit glare of the international stage.</p> <p>His revelations have set off a string of investigations - by prosecutors, politicians, police and journalists - which have entangled Germany's pre-eminent statesman, Helmut Kohl, and Mr Kohl's successor as the leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.</p> <p>But Mr Schreiber is also a central figure in another probe involving sums of money vastly greater than any shown to have been given to Germany's conservatives.</p> <p>When he was arrested in Toronto last August, the Mounties found Mr Schreiber, who holds dual German and Canadian nationality, was carrying a bag containing the equivalent of \u00a312,500 in nine currencies.</p> <p>Dubbed the \"King of Schmooze\" by the Canadian press, the silver-haired Mr Schreiber has forged an astonishing network of powerful connections on both sides of the Atlantic; his bail was arranged with the help of two former Canadian cabinet ministers - one from each of the main parties.</p> <p>Though often described as an arms dealer, Mr Schreiber is in no sense a professional in the business of weapons trading. Born in Bavaria in 1934, he grew to maturity in the tough, bleak environment of devastated, post-war Germany. He left school at 16 and went to work in a department store, but was soon trading on his own account, importing carpets from what was then Persia.</p> <p>At a press conference earlier this week, Mr Sch\u00e4uble provoked chortles when he said that he had been introduced to Mr Schreiber as someone whose firm put the lines on autobahns - yet it was true. In the late 1950s or early 1960s, Mr Schreiber took a stake in a company near Munich that specialised in paving and road marking.</p> <p>He later acquired control. Firms such as these depend almost entirely on public-sector contracts.

      "bodyText": "Multinational businessman Karlheinz Schreiber, whose donation disclosures are at the root of the scandal rocking German politics, is one of the most intriguing figures to have been thrust into the floodlit glare of the international stage. His revelations have set off a string of investigations - by prosecutors, politicians, police and journalists - which have entangled Germany's pre-eminent statesman, Helmut Kohl, and Mr Kohl's successor as the leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. But Mr Schreiber is also a central figure in another probe involving sums of money vastly greater than any shown to have been given to Germany's conservatives. When he was arrested in Toronto last August, the Mounties found Mr Schreiber, who holds dual German and Canadian nationality, was carrying a bag containing the equivalent of \u00a312,500 in nine currencies. Dubbed the \"King of Schmooze\" by the Canadian press, the silver-haired Mr Schreiber has forged an astonishing network of powerful connections on both sides of the Atlantic; his bail was arranged with the help of two former Canadian cabinet ministers - one from each of the main parties. Though often described as an arms dealer, Mr Schreiber is in no sense a professional in the business of weapons trading. Born in Bavaria in 1934, he grew to maturity in the tough, bleak environment of devastated, post-war Germany. He left school at 16 and went to work in a department store, but was soon trading on his own account, importing carpets from what was then Persia. At a press conference earlier this week, Mr Sch\u00e4uble provoked chortles when he said that he had been introduced to Mr Schreiber as someone whose firm put the lines on autobahns - yet it was true. In the late 1950s or early 1960s, Mr Schreiber took a stake in a company near Munich that specialised in paving and road marking. He later acquired control. Firms such as these depend almost entirely on public-sector contracts. So, from an early stage in his business career, Mr Schreiber coveted political contacts and goodwill. In the mid-70s, he went international. Opec had just sent oil prices soaring and Mr Schreiber expanded into the booming, petroleum-rich Canadian province of Alberta. It was not long before he had moved on from roads to real estate. He founded several property investment companies and persuaded a number of leading figures in Alberta's ruling Progressive Conservative party to sit on his companies' boards. His influence later grew to the extent that, as a friend of the late Franz Josef Strauss, then head of the Bavarian government and chairman of Airbus Industrie, Mr Schreiber helped to broker a $1.5bn sale of 34 Airbus jets to Air Canada in 1988. It was not just the biggest aircraft order in Canada's history, but it also the cause of one of the country's most explosive political controversies. In 1995, with the RCMP digging into the circumstances surrounding the deal, a government lawyer wrote to the Swiss authorities asking them for help. The letter alleged that Mr Schreiber had used a Zurich bank account to pay the former prime minister, Brian Mulroney, a C$5m (\u00a32.1m) kickback. Mr Mulroney sued and two years later won an apology and a settlement of C$2m. The government also apologised to Mr Schreiber, but did not offer him any compensation. When the RCMP arrested Mr Schreiber in August, it was for a different, though related, reason. The security force was acting on an arrest warrant issued by prosecutors in Bavaria, who accused Mr Schreiber of failing to pay tax of DM25m (\u00a38m) on commission it said he received from deals he brokered in the late 80s and early 90s. One was for the sale of German armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Mr Schreiber's disclosure that he handed more than DM1m in cash to the CDU in the same year was the match that lit the fuse under Germany's Christian Democrats. Though the personalities and circumstances of the two men are quite different, Mr Schreiber's role in German politics is starting to resemble that which Licio Gelli, head of the powerful P2 Masonic lodge, once played in Italian affairs. Unlike Gelli, Mr Schreiber has never been convicted of any offence. But, as with Gelli, there is a pattern of affinity with the political right. Mr Schreiber, moreover, has shown that, like Italy's \"puppet master\", he is the keeper of many explosive secrets.

But there is no ambiguity about The Rake's Progress, composed in the years after the second world war, and first performed in Venice in 1951 , a work in three full acts, with a libretto by WH Auden and ChesterKallman, based on Hogarth's series of engravings of the same name. </p> <p>In the curve of Stravinsky's development, The Rake's Progress is a crucial work, effectively signalling the end of his neoclassical period.

      "bodyText": "The Bronx, 1977. Beside the East River, the guys from the neighbourhood round on their unfortunate junkie acquaintance Woodstock (Saverio Guerra) after he attempts to sell them \"broken\" lobsters stolen from the bay. As they send a barrage of abuse and the occasional kick in his direction, Ritchie (Adrien Brody) appears in their midst sporting spiked hair, a Union Jack T-shirt and a padlock around his neck. His accent is a wildly unsuccessful attempt at Cockney. \"Oi, you ain't Bruce Lee,\" he exclaims, \"so stop kicking Woodstock.\" The guys stare at him, incredulous. \"Holy shit, is that Ritchie?\" \"What the hell happened to you, you freak?\" \"Noice outfit. Where'd you get it, off the dead?\" Ritchie smiles beatifically. \"What's 'appening guys?\" Joey T (Michael Rispoli) the group's ringleader, stands eye-to-eye with his one-time old friend. \"Don't give me that 'what's happening guys' bullshit. You come back to the neighbourhood, looking like a fucking freak, sounding like a British fag, and we're supposed to be OK with that?\" Ritchie pauses for a second. \"You're feckin' right. So, how's the wife and kids, JT?\" \"I got divorced. Moved back in with my mother.\" A timorous Woodstock approaches, still clutching his bag of sub-standard lobsters. \"A dollar each?\" Mayhem breaks out once again.

Well the Fiver actually, when it was trying to recruit members for its fledgling organisation - Footballing Emails for Autocracy.

Charterhouse own 36% of Wednesday, and were the MPs' first stop when they wanted to know how Wilson threw away three points at Upton Park last November.</p> <p>Mr Betts, the honourable member for Attercliffe, immediately went on the record regarding Wilson, whom he appears to consider an honourable member. \"Any other Premiership club would have sacked the manager by now,\" said Betts. \"He has had some money but he hasn't spent it well. I don't dislike Danny Wilson. I was in favour of his appointment. But you judge people on results.\"</p> <p>Surprisingly enough, Wednesday chairman Dave Richards doesn't agree. Richards, who has backed Wilson to the hilt this season said: \"I am staggered and saddened to learn of the MPs' brutal attack on Danny.

      "body": "<p>Proust's A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu (or, in English, How Can I Possibly Find the Time to Read This) is the cornerstone of modern literature; it is also a book few people have actually read. Proust wrote it after the death of his mother, when he withdrew from society to his famous cork-lined room to reflect on memory, art and guilt. He spent the next two decades there, emerging only occasionally and usually at night. This is very much the method to employ if you intend to read his masterpiece. </p> <p>For 80 years, with the honourable exceptions of Terence Kilmartin, Alain de Botton and Michael Portillo, we have been meaning to read Proust but not quite managing it. We know it is important; we know that the way he treats time, cuts between past and present, and replicates the workings of the mind changed the art of novel-writing forever; we know his baroque style, those endless, loopingly lyrical sentences, piling metaphor upon metaphor, going on for page after page, losing themselves in the folds of his boundless imagination, one sub-clause giving way to another like endless waves breaking on a beach beneath a lowering November sky, the peeling paint on the neat row of beach huts redolent of a lost innocence that somehow... sorry; we know his style is extraordinary, enveloping, captivating. Yet still we do not read him; or, rather, we try and, more often that not, we fail. </p> <p>That may now be set to change; there are signs that this is Marcel's moment. The catalyst is Raul Ruiz's film of the last part of the novel, Le Temps Retrouv\u00e9, which has just been released to critical acclaim. The history of the film-hating Proust on screen has been patchy: Visconti, Ren\u00e9 Clement and Joseph Losey all failed to get their projects off the ground; Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff's film of the first volume (Swann in Love) was widely panned; and Percy Adlon's C\u00e9leste was more biopic than film of the book. Ruiz has gone some of the way to disproving the adage that great books make lousy movies. </p> <p>Better still, this week the book jumped 3,000 places in the Booktrack bestseller list. Admittedly, that represents just 217 copies in a flat post-Christmas market and it only sits at number 544 in the fiction list; but it is a big book, a major investment, a lot of book tokens. A spokeswoman for Booktrack (\"I've heard of Proust but I've never read him\") is convinced there is a trend: \"It wasn't even in the top 5,000 in December, but it's suddenly appeared.\" </p> <p>There are other straws in the wind: the success of De Botton's How Proust Can Change Your Life and of Phyllis Rose's The Year of Reading Proust; a major Proust exhibition in Paris; a controversial comic-book version by Stephane Heuet; a biography by Jean-Yves Tadie, due in July; the final volume of a new edition of his letters out this month; and an unlikely-sounding Proustian guide to gardening. The Proust industry is working overtime; the figures show a modest boost in sales of the novel; all that remains now is to find the time to read it. </p> <p>The film has presumably helped sales of the book, but it only opened last Friday and may not alone account for the increase. De Botton identified another factor: \"It is a new century and people are saying, 'I'll finally conquer Proust before I die.' \" You didn't manage it in the last millennium, but the slate is wiped clean; you've been given another chance; you can have your cake and eat it. </p> <p>Reading the book, as De Botton pointed out, can be a seminal experience.

Clive James learned French just to read it in the original. San Francisco boasts a Marcel Proust Support Group, which holds an annual wake for the master at which Prousties wax their moustaches, dunk madeleines and take turns lying in a coffin (whether they actually read the book is not clear). </p> <p>Proust has always had influential champions - the finishers, the re-readers, members of the Marcel Proust Support Group (Hampstead branch), dinner-party Proustians who spend hours dissecting various translations, Harold Bloom (\"Proust defeats his critics\") - but they have been outnumbered by the life's-too-shorters, those for whom there are no longueurs longer than Proust's. Even Proust's brother, a doctor, was less than convinced. \"The sad thing is that people have to be very ill or have broken a leg in order to read A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu,\" he said. </p> <p>A straw poll of a dozen of my Guardian colleagues unearthed seven who had never set off; one who had started in English and stopped; one who had started in French and in English and stopped both times; two who had happily dipped with no apparent intention of reading the whole thing (three, six, seven, eight, nine or 12 volumes, depending on how you slice it; 3,000-plus pages; 1.3m words; not many sentences but that hardly helps); and one, hero of heroes, who had spent the best part of a year reading it, to the exclusion of pretty well anything else.

I have tried to read Proust several times without ever getting very far; further than Alan Coren, who took five years to read 53 pages and has now given it up in protest at the French ban on British beef, but not very far. In the middle of December I fell victim to millennial angst and began again: I am now further in than ever before and enjoying it.

A few years back, Waterstone's conducted a poll to determine which books people felt most guilty about not having read. A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu was an easy winner.

      "bodyText": "Proust's A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu (or, in English, How Can I Possibly Find the Time to Read This) is the cornerstone of modern literature; it is also a book few people have actually read. Proust wrote it after the death of his mother, when he withdrew from society to his famous cork-lined room to reflect on memory, art and guilt. He spent the next two decades there, emerging only occasionally and usually at night. This is very much the method to employ if you intend to read his masterpiece. For 80 years, with the honourable exceptions of Terence Kilmartin, Alain de Botton and Michael Portillo, we have been meaning to read Proust but not quite managing it. We know it is important; we know that the way he treats time, cuts between past and present, and replicates the workings of the mind changed the art of novel-writing forever; we know his baroque style, those endless, loopingly lyrical sentences, piling metaphor upon metaphor, going on for page after page, losing themselves in the folds of his boundless imagination, one sub-clause giving way to another like endless waves breaking on a beach beneath a lowering November sky, the peeling paint on the neat row of beach huts redolent of a lost innocence that somehow... sorry; we know his style is extraordinary, enveloping, captivating. Yet still we do not read him; or, rather, we try and, more often that not, we fail. That may now be set to change; there are signs that this is Marcel's moment. The catalyst is Raul Ruiz's film of the last part of the novel, Le Temps Retrouv\u00e9, which has just been released to critical acclaim. The history of the film-hating Proust on screen has been patchy: Visconti, Ren\u00e9 Clement and Joseph Losey all failed to get their projects off the ground; Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff's film of the first volume (Swann in Love) was widely panned; and Percy Adlon's C\u00e9leste was more biopic than film of the book. Ruiz has gone some of the way to disproving the adage that great books make lousy movies. Better still, this week the book jumped 3,000 places in the Booktrack bestseller list. Admittedly, that represents just 217 copies in a flat post-Christmas market and it only sits at number 544 in the fiction list; but it is a big book, a major investment, a lot of book tokens. A spokeswoman for Booktrack (\"I've heard of Proust but I've never read him\") is convinced there is a trend: \"It wasn't even in the top 5,000 in December, but it's suddenly appeared.\" There are other straws in the wind: the success of De Botton's How Proust Can Change Your Life and of Phyllis Rose's The Year of Reading Proust; a major Proust exhibition in Paris; a controversial comic-book version by Stephane Heuet; a biography by Jean-Yves Tadie, due in July; the final volume of a new edition of his letters out this month; and an unlikely-sounding Proustian guide to gardening. The Proust industry is working overtime; the figures show a modest boost in sales of the novel; all that remains now is to find the time to read it. The film has presumably helped sales of the book, but it only opened last Friday and may not alone account for the increase. De Botton identified another factor: \"It is a new century and people are saying, 'I'll finally conquer Proust before I die.' \" You didn't manage it in the last millennium, but the slate is wiped clean; you've been given another chance; you can have your cake and eat it.

San Francisco boasts a Marcel Proust Support Group, which holds an annual wake for the master at which Prousties wax their moustaches, dunk madeleines and take turns lying in a coffin (whether they actually read the book is not clear). Proust has always had influential champions - the finishers, the re-readers, members of the Marcel Proust Support Group (Hampstead branch), dinner-party Proustians who spend hours dissecting various translations, Harold Bloom (\"Proust defeats his critics\") - but they have been outnumbered by the life's-too-shorters, those for whom there are no longueurs longer than Proust's. Even Proust's brother, a doctor, was less than convinced. \"The sad thing is that people have to be very ill or have broken a leg in order to read A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu,\" he said. A straw poll of a dozen of my Guardian colleagues unearthed seven who had never set off; one who had started in English and stopped; one who had started in French and in English and stopped both times; two who had happily dipped with no apparent intention of reading the whole thing (three, six, seven, eight, nine or 12 volumes, depending on how you slice it; 3,000-plus pages; 1.3m words; not many sentences but that hardly helps); and one, hero of heroes, who had spent the best part of a year reading it, to the exclusion of pretty well anything else.

Lance Klusener was 22 not out, with Shaun Pollock on nine.</p> <p>The pitch had been sweating under covers all morning, and Darren Gough took advantage of the lavish seam movement it offered as early as the first over when he got one to leave Gary Kirsten and take his outside edge on the way to Chris Adams at second slip for a duck. England were delighted to see the back of Kirsten, whose last two Test scores had been 275 and 80, and South Africa were 1 for 1.</p> <p>It was soon 15 for 2, as Andy Caddick got one to lift into Herschelle Gibbs, who simply turned his back on the ball, which hit his glove and flew to Chris Adams, moving smartly in front of Mike Atherton at first slip. </p> <p>Jacques Kallis overcame a tricky start, particularly against Gough, and started to play his shots, pulling Chris Silverwood for six the ball before cutting him through point for four. Silverwood seemed incapable of realising that short deliveries were a waste on a wicket that was made to pitch the ball up. He seemed more intent on clunking Kallis on the helmet, as he had done at Port Elizabeth.</p> <p>More rain extended the tea interval, taken at 43 for 2, to 40 minutes, and Daryll Cullinan brought up the South African 50 soon after with a glorious cover drive for four off a Gough half-volley. But Caddick replaced Silverwood and bowled Kallis with his first ball for 25 as he pitched one up, and South Africa were back in trouble at 50 for 3.</p> <p>They were in even more difficulty when Hansie Cronje prodded forward tentatively to Gough and got an inside edge on to his pad that carried to Darren Maddy at short leg for a duck to make it 55 for 4. Cronje has now made just 1 run in his last three innings, and has yet to pass 44 in the series. He has become the weak link of the South African batting line-up.</p> <p>Then England began to lose the plot. In their efforts to get rid of South Africa's debutant, the Border captain Pieter Strydom, they fed his two favourite shots: the cut and the push off the pads. Maddy should have run him out for 0 but missed with a flick from short leg as Strydom set off in a moment of madness, and he gradually grew in confidence.</p> <p>His innings came to an unlucky end when, on 30, he was given out caught behind off Silverwood (102 for 5). Replays suggested the ball might have brushed only his shirt. It gave England a lifeline they hardly deserved, and Silverwood a wicket he certainly didn't.</p> <p>Klusener entered the fray and was soon picking off the loose ends of the England attack, cutting Mullally for four just wide of gully, and later hooking Silverwood (who was still inexplicably pitching short) for six over long-leg.</p> <p>In between, Cullinan, who should have been given out leg before to Caddick earlier in his innings, was dropped by Maddy at square-leg as he pulled a short one from Mullally. The ball went straight to him, but popped out, in exactly the same way as it had done before Cullinan reached his hundred at Cape Town. </p> <p>Cullinan had 34 at the time, and England were fortunate that the drop didn't prove costly: on 46, he tried to pull Mullally again, but spooned the ball straight up in the air and Mullally held on to a simple catch with Cullinan already walking off. It was 136 for 6.</p> <p>Klusener brought up the 150 with a firm-footed slap off Gough through the covers for 4, and the batsmen accepted umpires' offer of bad light five runs later.</p> <p>While 155 for 6 doesn't look like a great score, it may prove to be a useful one on this wicket. The weather forecast is variable over the next few days, which means conditions will remain loaded in the bowlers' favour. And it will be a minor miracle if South Africa let England score at 3.5 an over, as they were allowed to do today.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

Cullinan had 34 at the time, and England were fortunate that the drop didn't prove costly: on 46, he tried to pull Mullally again, but spooned the ball straight up in the air and Mullally held on to a simple catch with Cullinan already walking off. It was 136 for 6. Klusener brought up the 150 with a firm-footed slap off Gough through the covers for 4, and the batsmen accepted umpires' offer of bad light five runs later. While 155 for 6 doesn't look like a great score, it may prove to be a useful one on this wicket. The weather forecast is variable over the next few days, which means conditions will remain loaded in the bowlers' favour. And it will be a minor miracle if South Africa let England score at 3.5 an over, as they were allowed to do today. Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com",

This guy is already very wealthy and he still gets up every day at 4am to do his radio show,\" he said. </p> <p>At 33, Evans has founded one of the country's leading media companies in just seven years. </p> <p>He was a little known DJ on GLR 10 years ago before he joined the Big Breakfast in 1992 and became known as a talented producer and presenter. </p> <p>The Channel 4 entertainment series Don't Forget Your Toothbrush consolidated his reputation, and the future of his production company Ginger Television. </p> <p>However, TFI Friday, his Channel 4 show, has suffered dwindling ratings. </p> <p>The show's contract finishes at the end of the year and although talks with Channel 4 are continuing, no decision has been made about its future. </p> <p>Evans bought Virgin Radio for \u00a385m two years ago from under the nose of rival bidder Capital Radio, taking just over 50% of the resulting Ginger Media Group, with venture capitalists Apax Partners and Sir Richard Branson each owning 20%. </p> <p>They are reported to have prompted yesterday's sale by wishing to cash in their stakes in the company. Other bidders for Ginger are reported to have included the Guardian Media Group, the US media group Clear Channel, and the French radio group NRJ. </p> <p>Evans insisted yesterday that the deal was \"a merger, not a takeover\" and said key Ginger executives will continue to run the group's divisions. </p> <p>SMG will form a new national media division, run by Ginger chief executive David Campbell, to house Virgin Radio along with the group's cinema advertising sales company, Pearl &amp; Dean, and its poster advertising business. </p> <p>Ginger Television will sit alongside Scottish Television Enterprises which produces a number of ITV children's programmes and dramas including Taggart. </p> <p>The combined TV production operation will be headed by Eileen Gallagher, managing director of Ginger Television. </p> <p>SMG proposes to raise money to fund the deal through a \u00a358m rights issue. Its shareholders are to vote on the deal on January 31, although its largest shareholder, television channel provider Flextech, has already given its approval. </p> <p>But Granada Group which owns 18% of SMG is likely to vote against, having said last year it was opposed to the acquisition when it was first mooted. </p> <p>The deal coincides with a period of frantic activity among ITV companies jostling to form a consolidated network. Granada, which has been long expected to acquire SMG's ITV franchise, recently declared an intention to bid for the ITV franchises owned by Carlton Communications and United News and Media, which are themselves in the throes of a proposed merger. </p> <p>Industry sources suggest that SMG has preserved itself from the immediate threat of a takeover by Granada by acquiring Ginger. The group was founded in 1993 as Ginger Television after Chris Evans quit the Big Breakfast morning TV show. It now consists of three main operations: </p> <p><strong> Virgin Radio</strong> </p> <p>Launched on AM in 1993 by Richard Branson as one of three national commercial radio stations; two years later FM broadcasts were added in London. Evans joined the station in 1997 as the breakfast show DJ after storming out of his Radio 1 Breakfast Show. </p> <p>With backing from venture capitalists, he beat a rival bid from Capital Radio to buy the station from Branson later that year and merged it with Ginger Television to form the Ginger Media Group. </p> <p>Listening figures rose, but have since fallen. Evans created the UK's first quiz show millionaire in December in an attempt to boost the station's audiences. </p> <p>Virgin Radio is now part of a consortium bidding for two London digital radio licences. </p> <p><strong> Ginger Television</strong> </p> <p>Also founded in 1993, after Evans quit the Big Breakfast on Channel 4. </p> <p>Its first success was Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, the Channel 4 Saturday night entertainment show devised and hosted by Evans.

      "body": "<p>Savile Row, for 200 years a mecca for well-dressed men the world over, is facing civil war. The old guard is taking a stand against the suave young upstarts who are invading their territory. At stake (depending on who you listen to) is either the entire future of high-class tailoring, or the effective modernisation of the industry. </p> <p>Savile Row had its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, when the surrounding streets were occupied by hundreds of tailors employing thousands of people. This situation remained until the 70s, when ready-to-wear began to take over as a far cheaper alternative. The 80s were lean times; new talent dried up when traditional apprentice schemes were ended to cut costs and many tailors closed their doors. </p> <p>In the 90s, a new slimline Savile Row, consisting of fewer than two dozen tailors, flourished again as a modish search for luxury encouraged newly-moneyed men to demand the same hand-crafting the upper classes had always enjoyed. No Wall Street trader was complete without a visit from a flying Savile Row tailor. </p> <p>On to this thriving scene, several new businesses have arrived - Alexandre, 40 Savile Row, Paname - which advertise \"bespoke\" suiting at a third of the price of traditional tailors such as Dege &amp; Skinner, Anderson &amp; Sheppard, Maurice Sedwell or Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury, but use very different methods. </p> <p>Not everyone is happy to see these newcomers. Michael Skinner, managing director of Dege &amp; Skinner, explains: \"I'm delighted for them to be here, selling made-to-measure clothes, but 'bespoke' means the person who measures you cuts the pattern, cuts the suit, supervises the making in his own premises and is totally responsible for how it turns out. You can't achieve that in a factory.\" </p> <p>The book Textile Terms and Definitions defines bespoke as \"descriptive of a tailored garment made to an individual customer's specification\". Anthony Hendley, brands director at Baird plc, the company behind newcomer Alexandre, says bespoke does not mean made on-site. \"We want to take a fresh approach to bespoke garments - cleaner lines, a smoother finish. We're not aiming at the same price bracket. We're bringing fresh air to a staid and stuffy street.\" </p> <p>Alexandre's suits are hand-cut and machine-sewn. So are those of the traditional tailors. The difference is Alexandre's are cut by factory workers in Goole, Humberside, whereas traditional tailors cut the cloth themselves and the sewing is done on site by skilled trouser or coat makers. </p> <p>Around the corner at James &amp; James on Old Burlington Street, a different system is in place. \"The customer is measured by a tailor on site and his figures transmitted to a factory in France, where the cloth is cut by laser, machine-sewn, then sent back to the tailor for a final fitting.\" </p> <p>Eric James, owner of James &amp; James, is the only Savile Row tailor to make suits both traditionally and with the laser system. \"The best comparison is between a top-of-the-range Ford Scorpio costing \u00a330k and a Rolls-Royce costing \u00a3130k. Both are great cars. The Scorpio's fantastic - smooth, beautiful and fast - but if you're lucky enough to own a Rolls-Royce, you'll notice the difference and won't go back to a Scorpio. </p> <p>\"I made a bespoke suit and a laser suit for an American. The laser suit fitted so beautifully, it worried me a little. The bespoke suit fitted perfectly, too, and I suspect he was thinking: 'What's the difference?' Recently he came back to order more suits. He said: 'I'm going to order bespoke; the laser suit is fine, but bespoke is different.' And it is because we can do hand-work: smaller armholes, bigger sleeves for fullness in the shoulders. That can't be done in a factory.\" </p> <p> To combat accusations of selling out, James has introduced a new class of suit. When tailors on Savile Row say \"hand-made\", what they mean is hand-cut, machine-sewn and hand-finished. James is introducing a super-bespoke suit in which every stitch is hand-sewn, as it was in the 19th century. It will cost \u00a318-\u00a320k. </p> <p>The starting price for a traditional Savile Row bespoke suit is \u00a32k, which sounds outrageous until you hear it takes 70-80 hours to make. \"If you look at the rates charged by everyone from plumbers to window cleaners, you'll see why it's so expensive,\" says Hugh Holland, managing director of Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury. </p> <p>He takes a neutral view of the conflict on Savile Row. \"Bespoke is not the word to be having an argument about. Bespoke means 'bespoken' in the context of a customer asking for a particular type of suit. It's an order, not a standard or style of garment.\" But, he adds: \"People saying they are making a Savile Row-quality suit, but doing it in a factory, principally by machine, are trading on a reputation that's not theirs to trade on.\" </p> <p>Alexandre's Anthony Hendley believes nostalgia for the old ways fails to take into account developments in clothing manufacture. \"I have no desire to see a suit made the way I was taught 25 years ago. Trousers are crisper and cleaner now; jackets need to be sharper. If someone comes in and asks if we do hand-work, we send them to our next-door neighbour or to Kilgour. We give them business.\" </p> <p>Given that a made-to-measure suit from Alexandre or a laser suit from James &amp; James start at around \u00a3500 - roughly a quarter of the price of a traditional tailor's - it's little wonder the two are quarrelling. But the bigger problem for the industry is its lack of a large, solid client base: most men today have no knowledge of visiting a tailor and of the range of different services available. Men everywhere should be applauding the wider choice on offer. Though, as a general rule, \"You get what you pay for\" is probably still true.</p>",

The enduring popularity of urban chic - slouchy sweats, chunky knits and oversized combats with more pockets than you have possessions to fill them with - has enabled us all to get lazy, drink more, work out less and shove on any old thing in the name of style. But the brutal news from Milan is this: get fit and shape up for autumn, or forget being on the coming season's best-dressed list. Body-conscious style is here and if you don't have a taste for Diet Coke, you'd better acquire one because suits are slimmer, casualwear tighter, and there is a marked move towards skinnier styling all round. </p> <p>Donatella Versace likes her blokes to show off their bodies. In one of her strongest menswear collections to date, she showed multi-zipped leather biker gear, Jacquard silk suits and super-tight metallic lace shirts with matching ties, as well as evening tuxedos that glittered with the polish of mirrored razor blades. Inspired by Fight Club, this was nose-bleed chic at its punchiest. </p> <p>Like Versace, costume national hommes had a deliberately dangerous feel. In a show broadcast live on the Internet (a first in menswear), models ground their heels into a runway lit with a grid of laser beams, wearing crackled black PVC trenchcoats, sandblasted leather Vespa jackets and second-skin trousers which zipped halfway up the leg and were worn with bronze metallic or tailored jackets. </p> <p>Even Milan's most sedate designers ditched their usual soft and non-confrontational characteristics to explore a different vision. Jil Sander, never one to expose the body, chose a much skinnier silhouette, announcing that the Sander man \"has never been in such good shape\". \"Suits which come closer to the man, without being too close to him\" were elegant and modern, in lightweight flannels of tonal foggy shades, the best of which featured peaked lapels and narrow shoulders. Even more daring for a designer who has made her name with luxuriant understatement were the electric shocks of violet and magenta she injected throughout the collection. </p> <p>Giorgio Armani, king of the soft, wide-legged trouser, chose a suit shape that was sculpted to the body, featuring a shaped waistline and a rigid shoulder. D-squared took hipster proportions to new depths, cutting trousers low enough to show a bit of butt cleavage, which then clung to the hips and flared gently into a boot cut at the ankle. In a collection entitled Demolition Chic, denim with a sandpaper texture, top-stitched in gold and splattered with mud at the ankles, was worn with T-shirts that were ripped, then laced together with leather thongs. </p> <p>Prada and Alessandro dell'Acqua both took a more sophisticated approach to the slimming-down process. At Prada, with a collection Miuccia called \"conscious elegance\", understated tailored separates in shades of espresso, Bordeaux, chino beige and washed navy were mismatched and just off-centre enough to look right. Overnight bags of canvas and ostrich leather, traditionally English shoes and conservative caban coats completed the look. Dell'Acqua used a caramel and butterscotch palette, highlighted with hot pinks, to rework traditional Fair Isle and argyle knits into retro jogging suits. </p> <p>Calvin Klein also looked strong this season, using a palette of greenish blacks, inky blacks and blackish blues for tight-legged tuxedo pants with a slight boot cut and fitted shirts with pocket flaps and matching silk ties. Nicole Farhi, in her first Milan show, also opted for the straight and narrow, describing her collection simply as \"real clothes\". She chose to experiment with contrasting textures, teaming fluffy mohair diagonal-striped sweaters with tough leathers. </p> <p>Jean Paul Gaultier is over gimmickry, for this season at least. Instead of his usual cocktail of avant- garde colour, he chose to say it all in sober tones of black, ivory and wet sand, accented only with metallic rose-coloured Lurex knits for evening. A sophisticated style for Gaultier and one that fell beautifully in line with the season's narrow-minded trend. The usually ebullient Dolce &amp; Gabbana also went with the flow for well-tailored clothes. Only subtle mixtures of oversized polka dots and Jermyn Street stripes on shirts, and shaved furs or lux furnishing fabrics on jeans, added the balanced mixture of excitement needed to make this vintage Dolce.</p> <p>If the trend for cling-to-fit is going to be taken seriously, other highlights to remember include optical-knit tank tops at Byblos, sprayed-on leather pants at Dirk Bikkembergs and seamed tracksuits at Issey Miyake. Vivienne Westwood produced some of the most covetable denim of the season, especially her boiler suit shot with bullet holes and washed out to look faded by time. Moschino added its usual high camp, with pinstriped suits spray-painted for added glitz. </p> <p>Two new names to look out for are Daniel Margolin and Andrew Mackenzie. The latter, who is currently stocked by Harvey Nichols, pushed all the right buttons with his spin on football terrace chic, while California-born Margolin, now being handled by Eo Bocci, the powerhouse distributor who works with Olivier Theyskins and Ann Demeulemeester, looked to his father's wardrobe for inspiration and presented odd-fitting but cleverly proportioned separates.

      "body": "<b>Age:</b> 47 <br> <b>Current position:</b> Acting president of Russia <p>Born in St Petersburg in 1952, Mr Putin joined the KGB's foreign intelligence directorate after graduating from Leningrad state university with a law degree in 1975. He spent - officially, at least - most of his KGB career stationed in East Germany monitoring political attitudes there.</p> <p>He returned to Leningrad in 1989, where he took up a position at the state university and developed a close relationship with Anatoly Shobchak, a key reformer who in 1991 became the city's mayor and appointed Mr Putin to various key administrative posts.</p> <p>Having proved himself a competent manager in St Petersburg (Leningrad's original name, restored after the collapse of communism), he was brought to Moscow in 1996 to serve on Boris Yeltsin's presidential staff. Two years later, Mr Yeltsin appointed Mr Putin head of the FSB, the KGB's successor organisation, and last year he assumed control of the coordinating body of all of Russia's security and intelligence ministries before being named prime minister.</p> <p>Mr Putin does not appear to have distinguished himself in his various posts. But he has his fans. Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister and market reformer and a friend of Mr Putin, says he had no trouble grasping economic complexities that left other Soviet-era apparatchiks befuddled.</p> <p>In his first speech as acting president, Mr Putin insisted there would be no backsliding on any of the key political liberties gained in the past decade. \"Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of the press, the right to private property - these basic principles of a civilised society will be protected,\" he said.</p> <p>Human rights activists are prepared to give Mr Putin the benefit of the doubt for now. \"People learn and change,\" says Larisa Bogoraz, a dissident who served seven years in Siberia. \"We all know democrats who turned out to be criminals. So there may be KGB officers with understanding of democratic values.\"</p> <p>One of Mr Putin's first decisions as acting president was to guarantee Boris Yeltsin from immunity for alleged crimes in the past, when many in Russia would have branded the former president deeply corrupt. That guarantee more than outweighed the dismissal of Tatyana Dyachenko, one of Mr Yeltsin's daughters, as a Kremlin adviser.</p> <p>Moreover, Mr Putin has retained many from the Yeltsin entourage, indicating that it will be as business as usual in domestic policy. The powerful Kremlin chief of staff Alexander Voloshin kept his job and Boris Berezovsky, the influential business magnate with extensive control over media outlets, is likely to remain an important figure in a Putin administration.</p> <p>In his short tenure as prime minister, Mr Putin has attained enormous popularity by launching a war against Chechen rebels. As Russian troops swept through Chechnya unopposed, the public loved their new leader. </p> <p>But his popularity could dive as quickly as the number of Russian casualties rises. As long as it was going well, the war masked public disaffection with the economy and muffled complaints about corruption. If the tide turns in the Chechnya war, that discontent could re-emerge and give Mr Putin's opponents an opening in the forthcoming election.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Age: 47 Current position: Acting president of Russia Born in St Petersburg in 1952, Mr Putin joined the KGB's foreign intelligence directorate after graduating from Leningrad state university with a law degree in 1975. He spent - officially, at least - most of his KGB career stationed in East Germany monitoring political attitudes there. He returned to Leningrad in 1989, where he took up a position at the state university and developed a close relationship with Anatoly Shobchak, a key reformer who in 1991 became the city's mayor and appointed Mr Putin to various key administrative posts. Having proved himself a competent manager in St Petersburg (Leningrad's original name, restored after the collapse of communism), he was brought to Moscow in 1996 to serve on Boris Yeltsin's presidential staff. Two years later, Mr Yeltsin appointed Mr Putin head of the FSB, the KGB's successor organisation, and last year he assumed control of the coordinating body of all of Russia's security and intelligence ministries before being named prime minister. Mr Putin does not appear to have distinguished himself in his various posts. But he has his fans. Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister and market reformer and a friend of Mr Putin, says he had no trouble grasping economic complexities that left other Soviet-era apparatchiks befuddled. In his first speech as acting president, Mr Putin insisted there would be no backsliding on any of the key political liberties gained in the past decade. \"Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of the press, the right to private property - these basic principles of a civilised society will be protected,\" he said. Human rights activists are prepared to give Mr Putin the benefit of the doubt for now. \"People learn and change,\" says Larisa Bogoraz, a dissident who served seven years in Siberia. \"We all know democrats who turned out to be criminals. So there may be KGB officers with understanding of democratic values.\" One of Mr Putin's first decisions as acting president was to guarantee Boris Yeltsin from immunity for alleged crimes in the past, when many in Russia would have branded the former president deeply corrupt. That guarantee more than outweighed the dismissal of Tatyana Dyachenko, one of Mr Yeltsin's daughters, as a Kremlin adviser. Moreover, Mr Putin has retained many from the Yeltsin entourage, indicating that it will be as business as usual in domestic policy. The powerful Kremlin chief of staff Alexander Voloshin kept his job and Boris Berezovsky, the influential business magnate with extensive control over media outlets, is likely to remain an important figure in a Putin administration. In his short tenure as prime minister, Mr Putin has attained enormous popularity by launching a war against Chechen rebels. As Russian troops swept through Chechnya unopposed, the public loved their new leader. But his popularity could dive as quickly as the number of Russian casualties rises. As long as it was going well, the war masked public disaffection with the economy and muffled complaints about corruption. If the tide turns in the Chechnya war, that discontent could re-emerge and give Mr Putin's opponents an opening in the forthcoming election.",

The new Labour peer and leading barrister, Baroness Kennedy, heads a cross-party coalition which yesterday tabled amendments which would effectively sink the legislation when it reaches its crucial committee stage in the House of Lords next Thursday. Rebel peers stressed last night that since Labour went into the last election supporting the right to jury trial, there was no obligation on them to pass the measure. The fact that the criminal justice (mode of trial) bill - which would remove the right to choose trial by jury from defendants accused of middle-ranking crimes such as burglary - started life in the Lords also means that the peers will not be voting against a measure already endorsed by MPs. An added element of uncertainty is that this is the first big test for the reformed House of Lords after the removal of the hereditary peers before Christmas.

His attack provoked attacks from the Bar Council, representing Britain's barristers, and the opposition. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats argued before Christmas that the bill removing the defendant's choice in about 18,000 cases a year was \"unamendable\" and therefore would have to be opposed as a whole. Amendments tabled last night try to restore the status quo by inserting the words that \"on application of the accused shall he be tried on indictment\" into the appropriate places in the bill. Mr Straw admitted yesterday he had changed his position on the issue but claimed \"the more I have examined the evidence the more it becomes overwhelming and the more the case against simply dissolves.\" He said perhaps the \"ultimate irony given the views of many who oppose the change\" was that one effect of the re form would be to reduce the prison population by increasing the number of people receiving lighter sentences in the magistrates rather than the crown court.

Daddy made her do it - she kept on having affairs with rich, handsome men. Which is fine in itself, but they were all married. Daddy said she'd scandalise the family name. So we tied her up and made her marry the most boring, backward, penny-pinching lawyer we could find. His wife had conveniently died on the Titanic. He didn't know what she was doing on it. Travelling to America by herself for God's sake! It's the stuff of trashy bestsellers, not the stuff of life. Anyway, Victoria could never quite suppress her rebellious urges - she attached herself to any passing project that demanded a leap of faith. She wanted to join that big war outside the window. It did look tremendous fun! So, tally-ho, off she went like a bullet. Of course, we couldn't tell papa or her husband so I took her place. </p> <p>Our father dies (I watch him do so, fighting back the tears).

Not even our bewildered widower of a father can tell us apart. Even after 20 years. And in spite of our radically different personalities. And dress. And manner. And way of speaking. Some say he is blind or dumb or that it is a novelistic clich\u00e9 anyway, but he really is dumbfounded by our sameness. Truly. If I keep on going, will you believe me? Seriously, I can say it again! Daddy wanted his children to run his old steel mills for him but we're women and this is the early 20th century so all those petticoated, middle-class women's libbers haven't made any changes yet. Don't tell Victoria I said that - she's my other half, the racy, adventurous one. I am as timid and chaste as a virgin, she is as pure as the driven slush. I, one half of the mirror, she the other. M-i-r-r-o-r I-m-a-g-e. Do you see it now? Are you sure? I can spell it out if you wish, dear casual reader! She married the man I loved. Bitch. Daddy made her do it - she kept on having affairs with rich, handsome men. Which is fine in itself, but they were all married. Daddy said she'd scandalise the family name. So we tied her up and made her marry the most boring, backward, penny-pinching lawyer we could find. His wife had conveniently died on the Titanic. He didn't know what she was doing on it. Travelling to America by herself for God's sake! It's the stuff of trashy bestsellers, not the stuff of life. Anyway, Victoria could never quite suppress her rebellious urges - she attached herself to any passing project that demanded a leap of faith. She wanted to join that big war outside the window. It did look tremendous fun! So, tally-ho, off she went like a bullet. Of course, we couldn't tell papa or her husband so I took her place. Our father dies (I watch him do so, fighting back the tears). We both fall pregnant - Victoria, the little demon, by another man. I give birth to twins (and yes, you guessed it, they're identical girls). But Victoria dies. What did you think this was - a bloody fairy-tale? \u0095 And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested Remember, sleepy reader, appearances can be deceptive.

      "trailText": "<B>When was it set up?</B>",
      "byline": "Patrick Barkham",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>When was it set up?</b> <p>In 1948 Labour's Aneurin Bevan established the National Health Service to provide free, state-run, health care for all, a crucial part of the welfare state. </p> <p><b>Why all the talk of crisis?</b></p> <p>Every winter, bed shortages in the NHS provoke a spate of stories about a worsening 'crisis'. This year is no exception. On Sunday, it was reported that there were fewer than 30 emergency hospital beds free across the entire country. Lurid accounts of chaotic emergency wards and crammed morgues abound.</p> <p><b>Why are hospitals short of beds?</b></p> <p>Hospitals now operate at close to full capacity. A decade ago, around 75% of beds in emergency wards were regularly occupied. Today, more than 95% are. </p> <p>The shortage of emergency beds can be traced to a lack of money and related 'efficiency savings'. London has lost 40% of its acute beds since 1982, a figure that is reflected nationally. </p> <p><b>What are the reasons?</b></p> <p>There are broadly three theories. First, the government blames the bed shortages and cancelled operations on the <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/flu/0,2759,120655,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">current outbreak of flu</a>, which they say has reached epidemic proportions, a claim <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3949601,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">refuted by the Birmingham research unit</a> which collates flu figures.</p> <p>Second, the structure of the NHS is said to be responsible: either too hierarchical and rigid, or hampered by an expensive and inefficient internal market, according to different critics. </p> <p>Third, \"<a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/flu/article/0,2763,120657,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">the problem is money</a>,\" as one consultant recently wrote. It is echoed by many doctors in the NHS and by Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, who has called for more funding to stop the same problems recurring next year.</p> <p><b>Is the NHS under-funded?</b></p> <p>The NHS is deep in debt. Mr Thornton estimates that the NHS's deficit will reach \u00a3300-400m by the end of the financial year. A national audit office report last May reported an underlying deficit of \u00a3717m, putting the total NHS debt at nearly \u00a31bn.</p> <p>The government stuck to the Tory spending plans it inherited for the first two years of this parliament, but its spending review last summer gave the NHS an extra \u00a321bn over three years. At an average 4.7% above inflation, it is the most generous increase for six years, but this extra spending hasn't filtered through to the NHS yet. </p> <p>Critics argue that it won't solve the current crisis, pointing out that Britain spends 1% less of its GDP on health than the international average, equivalent to some \u00a39 billion a year. </p> <p><b>Are the Tories to blame?</b></p> <p>The 1991 NHS reforms saw the introduction of the 'internal market' to the NHS. The Conservative government made healthcare providers such as hospitals compete for business from doctors and regional health authorities. Doctors could become 'fundholders', 'buying' the most cost-efficient service for their patients. Opponents of the scheme have criticised it for causing inequality in health care, as patients treated by profitable, fund-holding doctors could get better services \"bought\" for them than patients of poor practices or non-fundholding doctors.</p> <p><b>What is Labour doing now?</b></p> <p>Labour promised in its <a href=\"http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab97.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">manifesto</a> to \"raise spending on the NHS in real terms every year\" and abolish the internal market. </p> <p>It has also continued to use the Conservatives' rhetoric of creating more consumer choice, bringing NHS care closer to the customer. The <a href=\"http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/health_news\" target=\"_NEW\">NHS Direct</a> telephone and internet service aims to provide people with basic diagnosis and health advice without them visiting a doctor or hospital. </p> <p>As part of this vision, the government's <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1999/19990008.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">1999 health act</a> will introduce primary care trusts across England this spring. </p> <p><b>What are primary care trusts?</b></p> <p>Primary care trusts will be autonomous, statutory bodies run by GPs, nurses and other health professionals, handling annual budgets of at least \u00a360m.</p> <p>They will offer services such as high street health centres and more convenient day surgery, providing more flexible healthcare that also reduces the strain on hospitals.</p> <p><b>What do the critics say?</b></p> <p>Many doctors argue that primary care trusts may treat local needs with more sensitivity, but will be powerless to improve the health service because they won't have the funds. </p> <p>They say the public is more concerned with waiting 18 months for an operation than being unable to get telephone advice or see a doctor in the evening. And Labour has notably back-tracked from its manifesto commitment to reduce hospital waiting lists by 100,000.</p> <p><b>What alternatives are there?</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3943958,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Alan Milburn</a> has suggested the previously unmentionable idea of hypothecated taxes - taxes which directly go to the NHS. It could be a way to get the public to accept higher taxation on, for example, tobacco and alcohol. </p> <p>Alternatively, Michael Portillo has suggested that NHS under-funding will remain as long as it is dependent on taxation. In the Netherlands over 80% of total expenditure comes from health insurance. Only about 10% comes from taxes. In the UK 85% of health spending comes from public expenditure. However, funding the NHS through a new health insurance might simply be a tax by other means. </p> <p><b>Will the NHS ever be out of \"crisis\"?</b></p> <p>There are several fundamental problems. Treatments and drugs are improving all the time and becoming more expensive. More people are living longer. And expectations of good health and care are rising all the time.</p> <p>The NHS has done well to increase its supply. Between 1976 and 1998, the number of prescriptions dispensed rose from 309 million to 505 million, while the number of patients per doctor has fell from 2,400 to 1,900.</p> <p>Sooner or later, people may have to accept that a state-of-the-art NHS requires noticeable increases in taxation of one sort or another. The risk remains that the affluent will simply choose private healthcare instead of the NHS and then object to having to fund a poor service for poor people. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7150/37\" target=\"_NEW\">Michael Portillo: Something to celebrate - The Bevan legacy</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Government statistics</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">The British Medical Journal</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "When was it set up? In 1948 Labour's Aneurin Bevan established the National Health Service to provide free, state-run, health care for all, a crucial part of the welfare state. Why all the talk of crisis? Every winter, bed shortages in the NHS provoke a spate of stories about a worsening 'crisis'. This year is no exception. On Sunday, it was reported that there were fewer than 30 emergency hospital beds free across the entire country. Lurid accounts of chaotic emergency wards and crammed morgues abound. Why are hospitals short of beds? Hospitals now operate at close to full capacity. A decade ago, around 75% of beds in emergency wards were regularly occupied. Today, more than 95% are. The shortage of emergency beds can be traced to a lack of money and related 'efficiency savings'. London has lost 40% of its acute beds since 1982, a figure that is reflected nationally. What are the reasons? There are broadly three theories. First, the government blames the bed shortages and cancelled operations on the current outbreak of flu, which they say has reached epidemic proportions, a claim refuted by the Birmingham research unit which collates flu figures. Second, the structure of the NHS is said to be responsible: either too hierarchical and rigid, or hampered by an expensive and inefficient internal market, according to different critics. Third, \"the problem is money,\" as one consultant recently wrote. It is echoed by many doctors in the NHS and by Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, who has called for more funding to stop the same problems recurring next year. Is the NHS under-funded? The NHS is deep in debt. Mr Thornton estimates that the NHS's deficit will reach \u00a3300-400m by the end of the financial year. A national audit office report last May reported an underlying deficit of \u00a3717m, putting the total NHS debt at nearly \u00a31bn. The government stuck to the Tory spending plans it inherited for the first two years of this parliament, but its spending review last summer gave the NHS an extra \u00a321bn over three years. At an average 4.7% above inflation, it is the most generous increase for six years, but this extra spending hasn't filtered through to the NHS yet. Critics argue that it won't solve the current crisis, pointing out that Britain spends 1% less of its GDP on health than the international average, equivalent to some \u00a39 billion a year. Are the Tories to blame? The 1991 NHS reforms saw the introduction of the 'internal market' to the NHS. The Conservative government made healthcare providers such as hospitals compete for business from doctors and regional health authorities. Doctors could become 'fundholders', 'buying' the most cost-efficient service for their patients. Opponents of the scheme have criticised it for causing inequality in health care, as patients treated by profitable, fund-holding doctors could get better services \"bought\" for them than patients of poor practices or non-fundholding doctors. What is Labour doing now? Labour promised in its manifesto to \"raise spending on the NHS in real terms every year\" and abolish the internal market. It has also continued to use the Conservatives' rhetoric of creating more consumer choice, bringing NHS care closer to the customer. The NHS Direct telephone and internet service aims to provide people with basic diagnosis and health advice without them visiting a doctor or hospital. As part of this vision, the government's 1999 health act will introduce primary care trusts across England this spring. What are primary care trusts? Primary care trusts will be autonomous, statutory bodies run by GPs, nurses and other health professionals, handling annual budgets of at least \u00a360m. They will offer services such as high street health centres and more convenient day surgery, providing more flexible healthcare that also reduces the strain on hospitals. What do the critics say? Many doctors argue that primary care trusts may treat local needs with more sensitivity, but will be powerless to improve the health service because they won't have the funds. They say the public is more concerned with waiting 18 months for an operation than being unable to get telephone advice or see a doctor in the evening. And Labour has notably back-tracked from its manifesto commitment to reduce hospital waiting lists by 100,000. What alternatives are there? Alan Milburn has suggested the previously unmentionable idea of hypothecated taxes - taxes which directly go to the NHS. It could be a way to get the public to accept higher taxation on, for example, tobacco and alcohol. Alternatively, Michael Portillo has suggested that NHS under-funding will remain as long as it is dependent on taxation. In the Netherlands over 80% of total expenditure comes from health insurance. Only about 10% comes from taxes. In the UK 85% of health spending comes from public expenditure. However, funding the NHS through a new health insurance might simply be a tax by other means. Will the NHS ever be out of \"crisis\"? There are several fundamental problems. Treatments and drugs are improving all the time and becoming more expensive. More people are living longer. And expectations of good health and care are rising all the time. The NHS has done well to increase its supply. Between 1976 and 1998, the number of prescriptions dispensed rose from 309 million to 505 million, while the number of patients per doctor has fell from 2,400 to 1,900. Sooner or later, people may have to accept that a state-of-the-art NHS requires noticeable increases in taxation of one sort or another. The risk remains that the affluent will simply choose private healthcare instead of the NHS and then object to having to fund a poor service for poor people.

In Taiwan, Korea and Japan, all children were expected to master the basics of literacy and numeracy. \"This contrasts starkly with the belief within the English education system that perhaps 20% of children have special educational needs that prevent them making normal progress. \"It is also significant that Pacific Rim countries focus on a small number of academic goals,\" he said. Mr Woodhead warned of competing pressures on classroom time. \"As we ask ourselves what further skills we need for the 21st century, more simply gets added. Citizenship ... will soon be a statutory new subject for secondary schools.\" Academics might be right to argue that concentration on arithmetic should not be at the expense of other areas of maths where English children did well. \"But we have to have some priorities and we would do well to bear in mind the factors that make other countries in these studies so successful.\"",

      "body": "<p>Never before has the man in the middle of the football pitch been at the centre of so much controversy and criticism. Read the sports pages and the chances are that the match reports will focus as much on the referee's performance as that of the men kicking the ball. </p> <p>Last weekend for example, referees dominated the headlines in coverage of two vital FA Cup matches. The officials who presided over the bungled end of the game between Tranmere and Sunderland face an FA commission of inquiry. Refs are regularly criticised by managers, football pundits and irate fans. They certainly have been active - no complaints on the productivity score. This season alone there have been 843 bookings in the Premier League with 49 players sent off, compared to 795 bookings and 38 red cards for the same period last season. </p> <p>Managers are wont to blame over-zealousness, claiming refereeing standards have dropped; as a result, they say, the physical nature of the game is being killed. Officials respond that saturation television coverage, greater player indiscipline and the pressures of the modern multimillion pound game are making their job harder: managers, players and fans want scapegoats. If professional football has never had it so good, with increasing gates, widened popularity and spiralling wages, refs have never had it so bad. </p> <p>\"Standards have not deteriorated,\" says Philip Don, the Premier League's referees officer. \"It is television. At some matches there are more than 20 cameras. Every decision is analysed. Referees are under greater scrutiny than ever.\" </p> <p>There are 21 referees on the Premier League's list. None is full-time. Most have day jobs and have to take time off to referee matches involving multimillion pound players. Similarly, on the Continent there are no full-time referees, but those in Italy, who are among the highest paid in Europe, are given three days to prepare for a game. </p> <p>In England, each ref is officially judged on his handling of a game. An independent assessor attends each Premier League game, awarding marks out of 10 on the ref's performance; managers also mark referees. These marks are then sent to Philip Don who, on the basis of the assessors' reports, draws up a league table of performance. It is not made public. Some managers would like to see an automatic scheme for demoting and promoting refs. The bottom three in the table would be removed from the Premier League list while the top three in the First Division get promoted. Last season, the Premier League did indeed promote five from the First Division and removed two (on age grounds) - at its own discretion rather than on the basis of a system. </p> <p>John Barnwell, of the League Managers Association, says: \"Our profession is transparent. We have league tables and we are accountable. Everyone can see how we are doing. Referees are not accountable but their decisions can be crucial to the outcome of a game.\" </p> <p>Why not professionalise? Last year, Don suggested to the Premier League that nine referees should become full-timers, drawing a salary of between \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 on the basis of two to three-year contracts. This would give them more time to prepare for matches, increase levels of fitness, allow them to examine decisions and establish closer connections with the game. </p> <p>Premier League chairmen rejected the idea (which had the backing of football managers): it cost too much. Yet John Barnwell insists that there is no doubt \"full-time referees would improve standards. If someone does something on a full-time basis then they are likely to do it better than a part-timer. Of course there is no guarantee, but it does increase the chances.\" </p> <p>In cricket, former players do become umpires. Some within football claim that former players are likely to make better referees, given their \"internal\" understanding of the game. But there is a time problem with this suggestion.

      "bodyText": "Never before has the man in the middle of the football pitch been at the centre of so much controversy and criticism. Read the sports pages and the chances are that the match reports will focus as much on the referee's performance as that of the men kicking the ball. Last weekend for example, referees dominated the headlines in coverage of two vital FA Cup matches. The officials who presided over the bungled end of the game between Tranmere and Sunderland face an FA commission of inquiry. Refs are regularly criticised by managers, football pundits and irate fans. They certainly have been active - no complaints on the productivity score. This season alone there have been 843 bookings in the Premier League with 49 players sent off, compared to 795 bookings and 38 red cards for the same period last season. Managers are wont to blame over-zealousness, claiming refereeing standards have dropped; as a result, they say, the physical nature of the game is being killed. Officials respond that saturation television coverage, greater player indiscipline and the pressures of the modern multimillion pound game are making their job harder: managers, players and fans want scapegoats. If professional football has never had it so good, with increasing gates, widened popularity and spiralling wages, refs have never had it so bad. \"Standards have not deteriorated,\" says Philip Don, the Premier League's referees officer. \"It is television. At some matches there are more than 20 cameras. Every decision is analysed. Referees are under greater scrutiny than ever.\" There are 21 referees on the Premier League's list. None is full-time. Most have day jobs and have to take time off to referee matches involving multimillion pound players. Similarly, on the Continent there are no full-time referees, but those in Italy, who are among the highest paid in Europe, are given three days to prepare for a game. In England, each ref is officially judged on his handling of a game. An independent assessor attends each Premier League game, awarding marks out of 10 on the ref's performance; managers also mark referees. These marks are then sent to Philip Don who, on the basis of the assessors' reports, draws up a league table of performance. It is not made public. Some managers would like to see an automatic scheme for demoting and promoting refs. The bottom three in the table would be removed from the Premier League list while the top three in the First Division get promoted. Last season, the Premier League did indeed promote five from the First Division and removed two (on age grounds) - at its own discretion rather than on the basis of a system. John Barnwell, of the League Managers Association, says: \"Our profession is transparent. We have league tables and we are accountable. Everyone can see how we are doing. Referees are not accountable but their decisions can be crucial to the outcome of a game.\" Why not professionalise? Last year, Don suggested to the Premier League that nine referees should become full-timers, drawing a salary of between \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 on the basis of two to three-year contracts. This would give them more time to prepare for matches, increase levels of fitness, allow them to examine decisions and establish closer connections with the game. Premier League chairmen rejected the idea (which had the backing of football managers): it cost too much. Yet John Barnwell insists that there is no doubt \"full-time referees would improve standards. If someone does something on a full-time basis then they are likely to do it better than a part-timer. Of course there is no guarantee, but it does increase the chances.\" In cricket, former players do become umpires. Some within football claim that former players are likely to make better referees, given their \"internal\" understanding of the game. But there is a time problem with this suggestion. On average, it takes 10 years for a referee to make it to the Premier League, with most starting off with Sunday league matches. So even if the Premier League decided to fast-track former professional players, it would still take them six years to make it to the top. Don adds a rider: \"You also have to ask whether former professionals have the temperament to be a referee; how many of them would be prepared to start at the lowest level?\" The football insiders' view is often that referees conduct games in order to satisfy the independent assessor attending the match. They are motivated by the prestige and money of working in the Premier League. Philip Barnwell observes that there is indeed more money at the top. \"Many referees do not want to lose their place on the list. They are more concerned about satisfying the assessor and getting the money.\" This is unfair, given that Premier League referees are the poorest paid in Europe. The table on the left shows relative rewards from refereeing. England's \u00a3600 per match hardly compares with the rewards offered in Italy and Germany.

      "bodyText": "Cherie Booth, QC is involved in setting up a new star-studded set of chambers with leading radical barristers who have built up a reputation for taking on high profile cases that challenge the government. Some of the most sought-after barristers at top civil liberties chambers are set to join the prime minister's wife in the new venture. They include Tim Owen, who has acted for Winston Silcott and the killers of the Liverpool toddler James Bulger, and Ben Emmerson, one of the most prolific opponents of the government at the European court of human rights, in Strasbourg. Both are in the Doughty Street chambers of the prominent QC Geoffrey Robertson. Two other barristers had also been thinking of leaving the chambers, but have decided to stay. Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws - the QC Helena Kennedy - is a leading Doughty Street light and a friend of Ms Booth, but she is not planning to leave. The move has caused dismay in the small number of chambers which have cornered the market in civil liberties work. A source close to Doughty Street said: \"This has been causing turmoil for about a month.\" The source said there had been anxiety about the defections, but this had lessened now that the other two barristers had chosen to stay. Another of Ms Booth's new colleagues will be Nick Blake QC, who has inflicted a series of defeats on the home office in immigration cases. He will leave another well-known set of radical chambers, 2 Garden Court, which is expected to lose a second QC as well. The venture has been hatched amid great secrecy, and none of the lawyers involved would speak about it yesterday. Jon McLeod, of the public relations firm Shandwick, said: \"We can confirm that proposals for a new organisation are under consideration, and that we hope to make an announcement of major interest to the legal sector in the near future.\" The new chambers will concentrate on human rights law, expected to be a boom area once the human rights act comes into force next October. Ms Booth is unlikely to find herself personally in conflict with the government very often. She specialises in employment law and public law, but most of her public law cases are for or against councils. Because barristers are independent practitioners who share premises and facilities, rather than partners, her colleagues' challenges to the government are unlikely to embarrass her either.",

      "bodyText": "The alleged Nazi apologist David Irving yesterday revealed that Germany had issued a warrant for his extradition on charges of racial incitement. Mr Irving told the high court in London, where he is suing for libel over claims he is a Holocaust denier, that he feared arrest by police executing the warrant. He told the judge, Mr Justice Gray, that he was informing him about the warrant in case \"this end of the bench should suddenly be empty\". Mr Irving has been indicted since 1996 by German magistrates for allegedly breaking laws protecting the memory of the Holocaust. The charge relates to a speech the author made to a meeting organised by the far right German National Party in September 1990 in which he said: \"The gas chambers at Auschwitz which they show to the tourists are a fake.\" He was indicted over the speech six years later. A hearing was fixed for the following year, but Mr Irving did not attend. An extradition plea was sent to Britain last August. Mr Irving was fined \u00a315,000 in 1992 in Germany for making the same claim. He said he feared being arrested at any time: \"I have warned my family that I might not return one of these days.\" Mr Irving is banned from entering Germany. He said he did not attend the trial because his safe passage in and out of the country was not promised. Scotland Yard and the home office refused to discuss the matter. Meanwhile, back in court, Mr Irving denied accusations that he had manipulated documents to bury evidence that Adolf Hitler had ordered the mass murder of Jews. He is suing over the book Denying the Holocaust, which said he distorted documents to support his controversial views on the Holocaust. The book's author Deborah Lipstadt and her publishers Penguin books, deny libel. In his second day in the witness box, Mr Irving was tackled over his belief that Hitler did not order the annihilation of European Jewry. In his book Hitler's War he used files detailing communications between German army chiefs to claim that the Nazi leader had intervened to stop the murder of Jews. But Richard Rampton QC, representing Prof Lipstadt and Penguin, accused Mr Irving of deliberate mistranslation. One document refers to an order not to liquidate a trainload of 1,000 Jews in 1941. But Mr Irving had claimed it was an order from Hitler to halt all such killings. Mr Rampton said: \"You inflated it from one trainload of Jews and you inserted an order from Hitler for which there was no evidence.\" Irving denied a deliberate error and later under questioning said: \"Why should I lie?\" Mr Rampton replied: \"Because you are trying to exonerate, exculpate Adolf Hitler.\" In a dramatic intervention, Mr Justice Gray accused Mr Irving of \"totally perverting\" the sense of a key document in an article he had written. Again Mr Rampton had alleged the effect was to ignore evidence implicating Hitler to the mass murder of Jews. Mr Irving, who is representing himself, looked tired after a second day of cross-examination which at times dwelled on German linguistics. The case continues on Monday, in a bigger courtroom to accommodate the number of journalists and members of the public who want to attend.",

They argued that many people would not be recorded in the official statistics because they had contacted NHS Direct, the telephone help service, rather than visiting their GP. Most flu casualties are the frail and elderly, who are recommended by the department of health to have a flu vaccination in October or November. But take-up of the flu jab has not been high. \"We would like to be able to have better take-up of the vaccination programme in the coming year. We are going to have to look at how we can improve take-up,\" said a spokesman for the prime minister. There have been some young flu casualties. Mandy Nicholson, 26, from east London, was found dead in her bed by her husband, Daniel, two days after Christmas, just five weeks after giving birth to their daughter, Susan. She had flu which triggered a fatal bout of pneumonia. Mr Nicholson said: \"My wife had the baby five weeks before Christmas, then the flu, so when she started feeling ill again we just thought it had come back. \"She had the usual high temperature and there was no sign of her fighting for breath. We had no idea it might be pneumonia. She did not have the strength to fight.\"",

The authority's latest study, One Year On, Deaths in Police Custody, describes how 11 forces have installed closed-circuit TV cameras in cells for the first time and that 14 more are considering the move. Most forces have started to provide training for custody officers, including basic first aid and techniques for rousing drunks. Kent has nurses working in its police cells and 30 forces have started questioning prisoners to try to establish if they are mentally ill or have a history of self-harm.

      "bodyText": "Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday threatened to pull out of the joint Lib Lab cabinet committee if Tony Blair abandons his commitment to hold a referendum on electoral reform. In an attempt to step up pressure on the prime minister, Mr Kennedy warned that \"all bets would be off\" over Lib Lab links if Labour failed to fulfill its manifesto pledge. \"What I have made quite clear, in a completely non-antagonistic way, is that if Labour reach a conclusion which is diametrically different from the one they reached as a result of discussions before the last election, then obviously all bets would be off,\" Mr Kennedy said on Radio 4's The World at One. \"Obviously if you reach the end of the road in terms of a relationship which is trying to roll forward constitutional reform, you reach the end of the road.\" His remarks came after Mr Blair sounded a distinctly cool note about a referendum on electoral reform in the Commons on Wednesday. Asked by William Hague when he would hold a referendum, he would only say: \"Our commitment still stands and the debate goes on.\" Labour has lived up to its commitment to set up a commission on electoral reform, which reported in 1998. However, Mr Blair has failed to fulfill his pledge to hold a referendum in this parliament because he says the commission's proposals could not be introduced until after the next election. Lib Dems, who have accepted that a referendum cannot take place this side of a general election, fear that Mr Blair is going cool on the idea and may abandon his commitment altogether in Labour's next manifesto. Their fears were raised by a recent Labour party consultation which found that party members were overwhelmingly opposed to electoral reform. Mr Kennedy, who is still holding out hope that Mr Blair will keep his word, said that he was willing to wait a little longer for a referendum because he believes that supporters of electoral reform would lose a vote at the moment. \"I would rather that we go that bit longer and we win, than we were to have a referendum next week and we lose,\" he said. \"That would set back the whole cause for a generation.\" Mr Kennedy's threat to abandon the Lib Dems' links with Labour have been criticised by Paddy Ashdown's closest ally at Westminster. Menzies Campbell, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, told the Guardian that Mr Kennedy should continue with the Lib-Lab cabinet committee regardless of what the prime minister does over PR. His remarks, which set Mr Campbell at odds with Mr Kennedy, lifted the lid on a simmering row among senior Liberal Democrats over the performance of the party's new leader.",

      "bodyText": "Russia has revised its defence doctrine to make it easier to press the nuclear button in an international crisis, while unequivocally declaring the west a hostile power that must be resisted. A new national security strategy decreed by the acting president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday and to be published today marks a radical shift in Russia's view of the world. It ushers in a policy of \"expanded nuclear containment\" while pledging to resist western attempts to dominate the globe. The strategic shift lowers the threshold at which Russia may resort to nuclear weapons and is the first foreign policy move that Mr Putin has taken since replacing Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin on New Year's Eve. Mr Yeltsin's strategy, decreed in December 1997, declared that nuclear weapons could only be used \"in the case of a threat to the very existence of the Russian Federation as a sovereign state\". The new document states that the use of nuclear weapons is necessary \"to repel armed aggression if all other means of resolving a crisis situation have been exhausted or turn out to be ineffective\". The new strategy substantially eases the constraints on resort to the nuclear option. This has been partly triggered by the fact that Russia still commands a large nuclear arsenal, but its conventional forces lack combat readiness. \"These are very substantial changes,\" said a military affairs expert, Sergei Sorkut. \"The emphasis on nuclear weapons has changed. They can now be used in crisis situations.\" The Putin strategy takes a much more confrontational position towards the west, a policy overhaul sparked by Nato's expansion into former Warsaw Pact countries and by the US-led war against the former Yugoslavia last year. Whereas the 1997 strategy spoke of \"partnership\" with the west and decreed that there was no threat of military aggression to Russia, the new paper says that two \"mutually exclusive tendencies\" are now locked in combat on the globe. It says that the \"multi-polar world\" promoted by Mr Yelt sin, who sought to enlist India and China as allies, is in conflict with \"the west led by the US\" which aims to use its military might to dominate world affairs. It is not clear what the new strategy may mean for Nato's Partnership for Peace pact, agreed to appease Russia during negotiations to admit Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the alliance. Moscow froze its participation last year in protest at the Nato war in Kosovo although more than 3,000 Russian troops are serving in the Nato-led peacekeeping force. Russian commentary on the leaked 21-page document said it made it clear that \"the term 'partnership' has been consigned to the past\". The radical departure in nuclear doctrine, said Moscow analysts, represented an \"entirely logical development\" enshrining a new policy of \"expanded nuclear containment\". \"Russia will not only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack, but in response to a conventional attack when there is no other way out.\" The hostile tone appears to seal a drawn-out process of disenchantment with the west. A new Russian military doctrine, dovetailing with the Putin national security strategy, is expected to be endorsed by the acting president in February, said Sergei Ivanov, a close Putin ally and secretary of the Kremlin's influential security council. A draft of the military doc trine, published last October, also attacked the US and Nato but attracted much adverse comment in Moscow and many thought it would be toned down. Monday's decree by Mr Putin confirms that this will not happen, although Mr Ivanov said changes to the military doctrine would still be \"necessary\". On a more conciliatory note, however, Igor Sergeyev, the defence minister, said he was confident that the new parliament in Moscow, due to convene this month, would soon ratify the Start-2 arms control treaty with the US. Mr Putin is known to support ratification and he wants parliament to act before Russia's presidential election on March 26, a contest that he is widely expected to win. The timing of the adoption of the security strategy this week and the military doctrine next month also represents electioneering by Mr Putin, whose central message to voters is that he will restore Russia to its great-power status. The new strategy also places greater emphasis on the threats to Russia from separatism, terrorism and organised crime, and, in an indirect reference to the war in Chechnya, delivers a more forthright assertion of when Russia may deploy armed forces domestically \"in strict accordance with the constitution\".",

      "body": "<p>They are at the cutting edge of the new economy, but young hi-tech firms in Britain and Germany behave much like their forebears, according to new research published today. </p> <p>Confirming national stereotypes, the research found that British new-technology based firms are much more buccaneering than their risk-averse German counterparts. They are more international in their outlook, selling into a wider range of foreign markets, and also have the edge when it comes to marketing. </p> <p>German hi-tech firms tend to be more parochial, concentrating on the home market and Europe.

      "bodyText": "They are at the cutting edge of the new economy, but young hi-tech firms in Britain and Germany behave much like their forebears, according to new research published today. Confirming national stereotypes, the research found that British new-technology based firms are much more buccaneering than their risk-averse German counterparts. They are more international in their outlook, selling into a wider range of foreign markets, and also have the edge when it comes to marketing. German hi-tech firms tend to be more parochial, concentrating on the home market and Europe. They are often closely integrated to the supply chains of big international German businesses and more likely to sell customised products. British firms are promiscuous, preferring to make \"off the peg\" products which they sell to a broader range of customers with whom they have a casual relationship. The research, by academics from the London Business School and Germany's Centre for European Economic Research, found that the relative weaknesses of British hi-tech firms are familiar to students of British industry - poor skill levels and insufficient investment in research and development.

The crackdown follows a number of reversals for the Russian military offensive in recent days.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, the international humanitarian group which won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize, yesterday accused Russia of committing war crimes in Chechnya, and the US state department told Moscow it had an obligation to respect the rights of civilians trying to escape the war zone.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res made its accusation in an open letter to Washington urging President Clinton to press for an end to the war launched in late September by Moscow, which said its aim was to quash Islamic militants it blames for hundreds of kidnappings, incursions into Russian areas and a series of apartment bombings inside Russia.</p> <p>The president of the republic of Ingushetia - which borders Chechnya and has taken in wave after wave of refugees - also condemned Russia's new crackdown on civilians. It was crueller, he maintained, than anything done to the Chechens under Joseph Stalin's rule, when the entire nation was deported to Asia during the second world war.</p> <p>There was growing fear that the suffering could worsen dramatically if new \"filtration camps\" are set up to sift Chechen fighters from civilians detained under the new regulations; during Russia's previous war against Chechnya in 1994-96, such camps became notorious for their brutality.</p> <p>Russia has launched a fierce new assault on Chechnya to try to reverse successes by the rebels there earlier this week, and large numbers of civilians were yesterday trying to escape the intensified fighting.</p> <p>But refugees on the Chechen border with Ingushetia told of families torn apart by the Kremlin's new rules: Russian soldiers were refusing to let young boys flee the bombing with their relatives, refugees said in accounts from the scene.</p> <p>Datu Isigova, a refugee from the Chechen capital, Grozny, said she had been forced to abandon her 11-year-old son Arbi and her husband Suleman as she fled to Ingushetia. Other women had decided to stay in combat areas rather than leave their sons.</p> <p>Some men were unable to get back into Chechnya.

      "bodyText": "Russia came under strong international pressure yesterday to revoke a new diktat defining as rebels all Chechen males between the ages of 10 and 60, as the tougher security regulations provoked chaos and misery for civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the region. Some children were trapped inside the war zone as a result of the rules which came into force on Wednesday and now automatically classify them as fighters. The crackdown follows a number of reversals for the Russian military offensive in recent days. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, the international humanitarian group which won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize, yesterday accused Russia of committing war crimes in Chechnya, and the US state department told Moscow it had an obligation to respect the rights of civilians trying to escape the war zone. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res made its accusation in an open letter to Washington urging President Clinton to press for an end to the war launched in late September by Moscow, which said its aim was to quash Islamic militants it blames for hundreds of kidnappings, incursions into Russian areas and a series of apartment bombings inside Russia. The president of the republic of Ingushetia - which borders Chechnya and has taken in wave after wave of refugees - also condemned Russia's new crackdown on civilians. It was crueller, he maintained, than anything done to the Chechens under Joseph Stalin's rule, when the entire nation was deported to Asia during the second world war. There was growing fear that the suffering could worsen dramatically if new \"filtration camps\" are set up to sift Chechen fighters from civilians detained under the new regulations; during Russia's previous war against Chechnya in 1994-96, such camps became notorious for their brutality. Russia has launched a fierce new assault on Chechnya to try to reverse successes by the rebels there earlier this week, and large numbers of civilians were yesterday trying to escape the intensified fighting. But refugees on the Chechen border with Ingushetia told of families torn apart by the Kremlin's new rules: Russian soldiers were refusing to let young boys flee the bombing with their relatives, refugees said in accounts from the scene. Datu Isigova, a refugee from the Chechen capital, Grozny, said she had been forced to abandon her 11-year-old son Arbi and her husband Suleman as she fled to Ingushetia. Other women had decided to stay in combat areas rather than leave their sons. Some men were unable to get back into Chechnya. Kairish, a hairdresser, was trying to return to his eight children living alone in a train carriage a few miles in from the border, after what he thought would be a short trip to Ingushetia to buy food and shoes. \"I don't know what to do. My wife is dead and my kids have been left by themselves for two days,\" he told Reuters, holding a bag of bread. \"I am 55, and the guards told me I'm not allowed to cross because I'm not 60.\" President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia condemned Russia's measure in the bitterest terms, describing it as \"illegal and discriminatory\". It would succeed only in alienating any Chechen who still felt residual sympathy for the Russians, he warned, and would prompt young men to join the rebels' cause. The problems experienced by refugees as a result of the measure were being monitored by human rights activists in Ingushetia. \"Chechen males are now effectively trapped in a dangerous war. It is fundamentally unacceptable to deny civilian males - including children as young as 10 - the right to flee from from heavy fighting,\" said a spokesman for the New York-based group Human Rights Watch. In its open letter, published in the New York Times, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said that almost four months of indiscriminate Russian bombing of Grozny and other parts of Chechnya \"constitute war crimes\". During the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo earlier this year, the letter said to the White House, \"your administration mounted an all-out public relations campaign aimed at rallying support for the humanitarian concerns of the besieged citizens of Kosovo. Where is the similar high-level, public discussion of the plight of civilians in Chechnya? Do they suffer less than the people of Kosovo?\"",

Simon Midgley Bacup, Lancs simon@smidgley.co.uk \u0095 One of the advantages of the current school year for second generation British Asians such as myself is that it enables us to visit our parents' homelands for an extended period each year, allowing us to appreciate their rich cultures get to know extended family members. K Osama Rahman Manchester \u0095 Nigel de Gruchy is wrong. The commission is not in cloud cuckoo land. This inquiry is responding to changing circumstances and the evident needs of children. Much of the stress experienced by teachers relates to the management of the school year. This term we returned in early January and with Easter very late will not be breaking up until mid April. After Easter we return in early May for a very short period before the half-term break. Chris McDonell Burntwood, Walsall \u0095 I note that the general secretary of the NASUWT has pledged to fight any erosion of teachers' holidays. Would it be indelicate of me to ask why teachers are entitled to 14 weeks' holiday when most people have to make do with four? Dr DC Hawkins Leominster, Herefordshire",

In a landmark judgment, the London South tribunal said the case did not come under its jurisdiction and that, for legal purposes, British embassies and high commissions should not be considered as being on British soil. The law firm acting on behalf of Pamela Baptiste, 43, who claimed she had been dismissed as a consular assistant at the British high commission in St Lucia on racial grounds, said it is to appeal. The tribunal said the question to be determined in relation to both the unfair dismissal and the racial discrimination charges was whether \"that place of work is properly to be regarded as having been in Great Britain\". It noted the foreign office argument that international law created a system of privileges and immunities for foreign missions but that this did not \"make the soil of a UK embassy 'forever English'.\" The tribunal concurred that \"although diplomatic premises are inviolable by the agents of the receiving state, they nevertheless form part of the territory of that state\". It concluded Mrs Baptiste had worked entirely outside Britain and so it did not have jurisdiction to consider her claim. Mrs Baptiste worked at the commission from 1991 to 1998. She had brought the case in St Lucia but said the foreign office had raised the issue of diplomatic immunity. A foreign office spokeswoman said: \"We would welcome the opportunity to defend the reputation of the high commission and the professional integrity of Peter Hughes [high commissioner] in court in St Lucia.\" She admitted the foreign office had raised immunity in St Lucia but that \"we would not use that as a means to prevent the case being brought to court\". Mrs Baptiste's case had run into trouble in St Lucia because she had taken action against the high commission rather than the foreign office.",

      "bodyText": "Police warned yesterday that guns had become \"almost a fashion accessory\" among young drugs criminals on the streets of Manchester, where the eighth fatal shooting in seven months saw a teenager bleed to death on a roadside verge. Armed patrols have been stepped up in a wide area south of the newly regenerated city centre where gang disputes are believed to have entered a new and vicious stage of individual revenge attacks. Greater Manchester police admitted that they were \"very worried\" about the resurgence of shootings in a city where sensitive policing after the murder of a 14-year-old bystander in 1993 saw the \"Gunchester\" tag disappear from the formerly troubled area of Moss Side. The new wave of killings has spread south from Moss Side into the neighbouring areas of Whalley Range and Longsight, with separate incidents involving rival gangs in Cheetham Hill on the Manchester-Salford border. The latest victim was 17-year-old Gabriel Egharevba, who was out cycling with a friend at 10pm on Wednesday when he was blasted from his bike by a gunman firing two bursts from a motorbike. The shooting echoed round Coverdale Crescent in Longsight, bringing out neighbours including a 28-year-old man who ran to help the dying youth. \"His mate ran back and kept shaking his friend,\" he said. \"When we arrived we could see he had been shot in the left temple. He wasn't breathing and there was blood everywhere.\" Neighbours tried unsuccessfully to flag down traffic on Hyde Road before paramedics and police arrived, but the youth was declared dead at the scene. The killing came shortly before a pre-arranged police appeal for information about the gangland \"execution\" of a father of three who was shot three times in the back of the head with a Browning auto matic on January 5 in an alley in Whalley Range. The charred body of Roger Ormsby, 34, was recovered from his gutted red BMW 320 which burst into flames after the corpse's foot jammed its accelerator and overheated the engine. Detective Superintendent Keith Jardine said that a frightening minority of local youths had turned to guns to get to the top of the local criminal pecking order. \"We have a relatively small group of youngish people who are into a culture where firearms have a great deal of importance and who have the nerve at the moment to go and use these firearms. It's a culture where the gun appears to play a large part. It is a respect thing. The gun is sometimes seen as an accessory - almost a fashion accessory - and is sometimes used to demand respect from their peer group.\" Claims of gun law in Moss Side were attacked this week by Phil Sumner, parish priest of St Wilfrid's, Moss Side, since 1976, who told the Manchester Evening News: \"Many people who have been in this area for years have never seen a gun and know only what they read in the papers about the trouble. \"A spate of shootings can often begin from an ordinary argument between two guys about a girlfriend, and because some of these men are involved in the drug economy they have the weapons to protect themselves. Once someone is shot the tit-for-tat thing can happen.\" The parish has targeted social deprivation in an area where pockets of unemployment among young black men top 80%. Self-confidence building measures include a module in African studies at St Thomas Aquinas school, where Father Sumner chairs the governors. He said: \"There is fortitude and joie de vivre here - the ability to celebrate life in spite of many problems.\" Posters appealing for information about the two latest killings were distributed yesterday in Whalley Range and Longsight and police are trying to build up a picture of gangland suspects. Mr Jardine said that evidence had not been found to link any of the eight killings directly to one another, beyond the spread of the youth gun culture.

Mr Jardine said that he was a \"private man\", with a long-standing partner, three children, and a share in a garage business and a small property company. The killings followed the shooting of Simon Brown, 27-year-old father of one, in front of relatives and friends at a Boxing Day party in Cheetham Hill. Shootings in the area totalled 41 last year, but the previous spate of fatalities came within 10 days last summer, when Martin Bennett, 25, Dorrie McKie, 20, and Antony Cook, 25, were all shot dead. The year's shootings included the raking of a pub and a family house in Longsight with semi-automatic fire. July 30, 1999 Patrick Logan shot by hooded intruder at his home in Withington July 31, 1999 Martin Bennett, 25, shot in Moss Side August 3, 1999 Dorrie McKie , 20, shot in Moss Side August 15, 1999 Anthony Cook, 24, shot after chase through Moss Side November 1, 1999 Courier Judah Dewar, 35, killed in Longsight December 27, 1999 Simon Brown, 27, shot in Cheetham Hill January 5, 2000 Roger Ormsby, 35, shot in Whalley Range January 12, 2000 Gabriel Egharevba, 17, shot from his bike in Longsight",

The spokeswoman rejected claims by pro-Pinochet supporters that Mr Straw had called for the report to remain secret, saying the former dictator had blocked the home office from releasing the report to Madrid.</p> <p>In Spain, prosecution lawyers in the case said Mr Straw was contravening the 1984 convention against torture by not allowing them to study the medical reports. However, legal sources conceded there was nothing they could do to challenge Mr Straw's decision.</p> <p>Spanish lawyers Joan Garces and Manuel Murillo, who worked with Judge Baltazar Garzon to prepare the case for extraditing Gen Pinochet for human rights abuses, said the withholding of the reports and the failure to keep Spain notified violated the convention.</p> <p>They claimed the medical checks should not have been carried out without doctors representing the Spanish case or the victims of torture.</p> <p>The Spanish government has intimated it has no desire to block Mr Straw's decision, but reports from Spain suggested Judge Garzon was determined not to let the extradition move collapse without a fight.</p> <p>Interested parties have until 5pm on Tuesday to submit objections. The home office indicated that Mr Straw may not reach his final decision for another week, depending on the number and length of the representations.</p> <p>Mr Straw's officials will inform human rights groups of the timing of his announcement to allow them to make plans to mount a legal challenge. This will avoid a dash to the high court to keep the general in the country if the home secretary ratifies his decision to send him back to Chile.</p> <p>Once Mr Straw makes his announcement he will have to refer the Pinochet case to the director of public prosecutions. Under the UN torture convention the home secretary has to inform the DPP who will decide whether Gen Pinochet should be prosecuted in the UK, although prosecution in British courts is thought unlikely.</p> <p>Disgruntled Labour MPs yesterday stepped up their campaign against the decision to send Gen Pinochet home. MPs from across the party signed two Commons early day motions protesting at the decision. Stephen Twigg, the ultra Blairite MP for Enfield Southgate, joined forces with the leftwing Jeremy Corbyn to declare \"profound regret\" at the prospect of the former dictator returning to Chile.</p> <p>\"If Senator Pinochet were to return to Chile he is unlikely ever to stand trial for the crimes against humanity committed under his regime,\" said the 16 Labour MPs who signed the motion. A second motion, signed by Mr Corbyn and Tony Benn, called for the release of the medical report \"in the interests of justice\".</p>",

Any challenge would almost certainly be based on the decision not to publish the medical reports which the home secretary relied upon in making his assessment that the former dictator is not fit to stand trial. \"Spain and the other states requesting extradition have not been able to have access to the medical report to challenge it, or to obtain independent medical opinion,\" the human rights groups said. \"The procedure Jack Straw has followed in deciding on General Pinochet's extradition is totally irregular and flouts natural justice.\" A home office spokeswoman said Mr Straw would only release the report with the agreement of Gen Pinochet, who has called for his medical confidentiality to be respected. The spokeswoman rejected claims by pro-Pinochet supporters that Mr Straw had called for the report to remain secret, saying the former dictator had blocked the home office from releasing the report to Madrid. In Spain, prosecution lawyers in the case said Mr Straw was contravening the 1984 convention against torture by not allowing them to study the medical reports. However, legal sources conceded there was nothing they could do to challenge Mr Straw's decision. Spanish lawyers Joan Garces and Manuel Murillo, who worked with Judge Baltazar Garzon to prepare the case for extraditing Gen Pinochet for human rights abuses, said the withholding of the reports and the failure to keep Spain notified violated the convention. They claimed the medical checks should not have been carried out without doctors representing the Spanish case or the victims of torture. The Spanish government has intimated it has no desire to block Mr Straw's decision, but reports from Spain suggested Judge Garzon was determined not to let the extradition move collapse without a fight. Interested parties have until 5pm on Tuesday to submit objections. The home office indicated that Mr Straw may not reach his final decision for another week, depending on the number and length of the representations. Mr Straw's officials will inform human rights groups of the timing of his announcement to allow them to make plans to mount a legal challenge. This will avoid a dash to the high court to keep the general in the country if the home secretary ratifies his decision to send him back to Chile. Once Mr Straw makes his announcement he will have to refer the Pinochet case to the director of public prosecutions. Under the UN torture convention the home secretary has to inform the DPP who will decide whether Gen Pinochet should be prosecuted in the UK, although prosecution in British courts is thought unlikely. Disgruntled Labour MPs yesterday stepped up their campaign against the decision to send Gen Pinochet home. MPs from across the party signed two Commons early day motions protesting at the decision. Stephen Twigg, the ultra Blairite MP for Enfield Southgate, joined forces with the leftwing Jeremy Corbyn to declare \"profound regret\" at the prospect of the former dictator returning to Chile. \"If Senator Pinochet were to return to Chile he is unlikely ever to stand trial for the crimes against humanity committed under his regime,\" said the 16 Labour MPs who signed the motion. A second motion, signed by Mr Corbyn and Tony Benn, called for the release of the medical report \"in the interests of justice\".",

After two days of insisting that the boxer's case could only be considered by the immigration service and was not a matter for the government, Jack Straw said it would be \"invidious\" to leave the decision to an immigration officer and that he was using his discretionary powers to allow Tyson into the country. The ruling means Tyson will arrive in Britain on Sunday for a fight against Julius Francis in Manchester on January 29, his first outside America. Mr Straw said he had been swayed by the potential economic damage involved in cancelling the sell-out fight and the fact that thousands of members of the public who had bought tickets would have been disappointed. The future of the bout had been in doubt because of immigration rules which state that entry into Britain should be refused to anyone who has committed a crime that would carry a 12-month jail term or more in Britain. Entry could only be justified on compassionate grounds. Tyson was sentenced to six years in 1992 for rape and last year was jailed for 12 months after attacking two motorists. Initially the government insisted that the compassionate grounds would be considered by an immigration official when the American boxer arrived at Heathrow. Mr Straw said: \"In the special circumstances of this case, it would be invidious for an individual immigration officer to weigh the competing considerations involved. \"I have looked very carefully at the representations that have been submitted to the immigration service by [the fight's promoter] Frank Warren and I consider there are exceptional circumstances that justify my decision.\" Mr Warren had submitted a 67-page document to the home office outlining the reasons why Tyson should be admitted to Britain.

      "bodyText": "Baby dies after being left in bath A nine-month-old boy drowned after he was left playing in the bath with his two-year-old sister, an inquest heard yesterday. Anthony Pinkerton died minutes after his mother had left him \"splashing about, sitting up and laughing\". The inquest in Windsor, Berkshire, heard that the baby and his sister Charlotte were left for about five minutes while their mother Vanessa made breakfast and went about her daily chores. The coroner, Peter Bedford, recorded a verdict of accidental death after hearing how Ms Pinkerton, 25, looked in on them and found Anthony floating face up in the water. Ms Pinkerton said the accident at her flat in Slough, Berkshire, last September happened as she chatted with her partner, Adam Leszek, about the birth of her cousin's new baby. She said: \"It is not very often that I put them both in on their own. I would normally get in with them and we would all play with the toys.\" Anthony had been bathed using the adult bath for two months, she added, and could sit up on his own and pull himself up. While the children were in the bath, she made cheese on toast and tea for herself and Mr Leszek and did some vacuuming before chatting in the bedroom with him. After about five minutes she checked on the children and screamed when she saw Anthony \"floating on his back face up\". She added: \"Adam came running in and started to give him mouth to mouth resuscitation. Charlotte was standing up in the bath and screaming.\" Neighbours called an ambulance which, according to Ms Pinkerton, \"took 20 minutes\" to arrive. \"The paramedics just walked up the stairs as if they did not have a care in the world,\" she told the inquest. Anthony was pronounced dead on arrival at Wexham Park hospital, in Slough. Peter Jerreat, a pathologist, said Anthony had drowned. He added that it was unlikely that the earlier arrival of the ambulance would have saved his life. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Bedford said: \"It is an absolute tragedy that a child this age should lose its life.\" Folic acid could cut spina bifida Folic acid, which can prevent babies being born with spina bifida, may be added to all flour following a report published yesterday. Yvette Cooper, minister for public health, yesterday said the government would put the proposal, in a report from the committee on medical aspects of food and nutrition policy, out to consultation. In the report, scientists said mothers who ate foods made from flour which was fortified with folic acid before and during pregnancy could reduce the risk of neural tube defects in their babies. Spina bifida is a form of neural tube defect. They said adding 240 micrograms of folic acid per 100g of flour would prevent 41% of cases of neural tube defects \"without resulting in unacceptably high intakes in any group of the population\". Women planning a pregnancy would still be advised to take folic acid supplements. Sarah Boseley Insect study may save Africa crops Scientists have been granted \u00a334,000 to study why birds do not eat a type of African caterpillar, in the hope that their work can save crops.

Life jail for revenge killing pair The brother and husband of a woman who had an affair with her uncle were yesterday jailed for life for his murder.

Ms Jackson claims Mr Dobson offered her a senior position in his \"cabinet\" in exchange for her asking her supporters to make Mr Dobson their second choice when voting. He also asked her to keep quiet about the conversation, she said. Mr Dobson denies putting any offer to her.</p> <p>\"Even after all these months, they still don't understand Glenda.

      "bodyText": "Glenda Jackson yesterday claimed that her Labour colleague Frank Dobson had asked for her endorsement of his campaign to become London's mayor by suggesting she should ask her supporters to put him as their second preference on ballot forms. The charge of sharp tactics was emphatically denied by Mr Dobson after his former ministerial colleague rebuffed the alleged overture. Far from declaring that Mr Dobson or Mr Livingstone was her second preference - both have asked for her support - Ms Jackson let it be known that she still aims to win the nomination from Labour's London electoral college next month. Both sides in the latest row admit that the two candidates talked privately on Wednesday. Ms Jackson claims Mr Dobson offered her a senior position in his \"cabinet\" in exchange for her asking her supporters to make Mr Dobson their second choice when voting. He also asked her to keep quiet about the conversation, she said. Mr Dobson denies putting any offer to her. \"Even after all these months, they still don't understand Glenda. If they think they can bounce her into an endorsement for Frank then they are in for a nasty shock. This little episode has made an endorsement for Ken a much greater possibility,\" her spokesman said. Mr Dobson's team, now staffed with party professionals and pulling in public endorsement from cabinet members such as Robin Cook, claims to be barely five points behind Mr Livingstone in the crucial constituency section, 35% to around 40%, according to its canvass returns. One in five Labour party members in London are allegedly still undecided, and Ms Jackson can count on 2% to 3%. Mr Dobson is expected to win the MPs' and MEPs' section, although Mr Livingstone is ahead in the trade union third of the electoral college. Privately Ms Jackson's staff know that she will lose, and agree that their rivals will each win one section of the college. But they claim that Mr Livingstone will win the constituency section \"by a mile\" and that Mr Dobson fears he will come third. That would confirm his defeat. Ballot papers go out to Labour's 60,000 London members on January 25 and must be returned by February 16. Each voter can list candidates in order of preference: hence the importance of the second vote. The result is expected by February 21 - more than a month after the Tories' second ballot, which is expected to confirm Steve Norris as the post-Archer candidate on Monday. The real election for mayor is on May 4.",

Sevim Oskay, whose army lieutenant son was killed five years ago, and Eyup Temiz both suffered minor burns as bystanders rushed to douse the flames. They were later discharged from hospital. Their attempted self-immolation in an Istanbul cemetery reflecting the fury felt by many relatives of those who died during the 15-year war in south-east Turkey, came as Europe heaped praise on the prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, for granting the reprieve. In the past, Mr Ocalan's supporters have more often resorted to setting themselves ablaze in an attempt to draw attention to his fate. By agreeing to wait for the European Court of Human Rights to review Mr Ocalan's appeal before sending the case to parliament - to approve the death sentence or reduce it to a prison sentence - Mr Ecevit is buying time to persuade his parliamentary allies that executing the Kurdish leader would severely damage Turkey's relationship with the European Union. No country in western Europe currently allows the death penalty. The European court is expected to find against hanging, although its review could take two years. Mr Ecevit is determined to avoid a clash with Europe so soon after the Helsinki EU summit last year, which saw Turkey accepted as a candidate for membership. Ankara's human rights record, in particular its treatment of the country's Kurdish minority in the south-east, has been used in the past by Brussels as an argument for delaying its coveted acceptance by the EU. \"It is the right way to handle this issue in respect of democracy, human rights, and the international commitments of Turkey,\" said the European Commission spokesman, Jean-Christophe Filori. \"It's good news for us,\" he said. News of the delay and the commitment to closer relations with the west was also welcomed by Turkey's business community - the stock market jumped by more than 7% during the day. And President Suleyman Demirel added his voice in support. \"This decision is a relief for the country,\" he said. Human rights groups in Europe and Turkey congratulated the 74-year-old prime minister on his decision, which the minority rightwing partners in the ruling coalition, the MHP, have opposed. \"While the death penalty exists, Mr Ocalan and all others on Turkey's death row remain at risk,\" said Kerim Yildiz of the London-based Kurdish Human Rights Project. \"Turkey should follow the example of other European countries by incorporating Protocol 6 of the European convention on human rights [which bans capital punishment] into Turkish law.\" Husnu Ondul, the head of Turkey's Human Rights Association, said the decision would spur the country's efforts to improve its poor human rights record, a priority for eventual EU entry talks. \"This is an encouraging decision for all citizens as an example of the protection of human rights and freedoms in the framework of law,\" he declared. Mr Ocalan, who founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has fought for Kuridish autonomy, was seized by Turkish commandos in Kenya last year and flown to Turkey, where he was tried. He was condemned to hang for treason for the war in which more than 30,000 people died. Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. Mr Ecevit personally opposes the death penalty. He largely got his way at a seven-hour meeting on Wednesday night with Devlet Bahceli, his hardline nationalist coalition ally who had sought parliamentary ratification for Mr Ocalan to be hanged. But Mr Bahceli won a pledge that the Ocalan file will definitely go to parliament for consideration when the European Court issues its ruling.

But you'll recognise said alter-egos; and if you don't, you should perhaps take tonight's opportunity to get acquainted. </p> <p>Because, while the adjectives most commonly employed around their 60-strong retinue of orthodontically-challenged grotesques are - by their own admission - \"warped, disturbing, odd... oh, and sinister, we get sinister a lot\", funny doesn't get as many mentions as it should. </p> <p>Equal parts soap opera and sideshow, the League's Tod Browning-meets-Peak Practice shtick is certainly one of the stranger visions to have crept onto the small screen in recent years; it's also the most nervelessly deadpan since Brass Eye, Chris Morris's late and still lamented one-man battery of the British infotainment industry. Although, having said that, you can see where the warped, disturbing, odd and sinister come in. Set in the fictitious northern outpost of Royston Vasey, home to toad enthusiasts Harvey and Val Denton, misanthropic Job Club maven Pauline and - lest we forget - Tubbs and Edward, the nightmarishly porcine owners of the darkly secretive local shop, the League must come as a shock to anyone for whom the caffeinated antics of Friends represents Friday night's comic blueprint. </p> <p>And, as such, it's the kind of acquired taste which means, after five years together, only now are the collective Gentlemen coming to terms with the pressures of expectation. </p> <p>\"Obviously, as ourselves, no one knows who we are,\" Pemberton explains, \"but as the League, I think there is a certain level of pressure going into a second series, which isn't something we've ever had to deal with before.\" </p> <p>\"It's been quite intimidating,\" agrees Shearsmith, \"because now the cat's out of the bag - everyone knows there's this place called Royston Vasey, and everyone knows it's full of these weird characters. So whereas we had the element of surprise before, now we're going to have to surprise people with new characters, and what we do with the old ones.\" </p> <p>\"So we've made everything bigger this time round,\" Pemberton interjects. \"It's almost epic.\" </p> <p>Besides the sheer freakishness of much of the material, meanwhile, there's also been the lack of easy categorisation to contend with (which accounts for the countless well-meaning but misguided comparisons to everything from Monty Python to Twin Peaks littering their press cuttings). Not quite sketch show and several leagues beyond the drab tropes of observational stand-up, theirs is probably not the largest peer group. </p> <p>\"There's always been a host of people we've admired and found funny,\" Dyson remarks, \"but I've always thought if you like and respect someone, you should like and respect them enough to try and avoid ripping them off, even subconsciously.\" </p> <p>\"And also,\" Pemberton continues, \"a lot of the time what you get with TV is producers assembling these sketch shows, assembling the cast and assembling the writers, and ending up with that fairly anonymous, production-line kind of comedy. Whereas with us, this is nothing but our sense of humour. This is what we find funny. However disturbing people might think that is.\" </p> <p>But has there ever been a point at which even they found their cast of inbreeds, failed rock musicians and accident-prone vets just too unsettling, too bleak ? </p> <p>\"God no,\" the cry goes up. </p> <p>\"The more hearts we break the better,\" Shearsmith laughs. \"I mean, if people are coming away from the show feeling freaked out that's great, because then they're really getting involved with the characters.\" </p> <p>And what, bizarre though it may sound, if one of those characters suddenly became hugely, implausibly popular. What if they found themselves responsible for another Loadsamoney, or a deformed, sexually troubled Mr Bean? </p> <p>They ponder the scenario. </p> <p>\"Then we'd kill them,\" Gatiss replies with a broad, innocent smile. \"Without a shadow of doubt.

You cut off each end of the banana with your knife and then, holding on with your fork, you slice the centre with your knife. With the curve of the banana towards you, peel the skin off and it rolls out. Then you gently cut up your little sections of banana.\" </p> <p>Golly, as Miss Broke-Smith is apt to say, golly, this is good stuff. If Dora Bryan had known her way around a fruit bowl, she would have been spared a most traumatic meal at Buckingham Palace. Imprudently she took a bunch of grapes and realised too late she was not au fait with the pip position. Did you spit them out and, if so, where? Conscious of Prince Philip's fascinated eye on her, the indomitable woman ate the lot. </p> <p>Ms Broke-Smith was an etiquette teacher, one of those interesting jobs that were not suggested to you at school. Almost everyone else was a social commentator except Beverley Bloom, who was a self-confessed shopaholic, and Giles Hilton, who was a happily married ex-accountant. I would have liked to be a happily married ex-accountant, but they kept suggesting the executive branch of the civil service. Giles must be a dreaded dinner guest as he not only brings his own Arabica coffee but \"jokingly\" identifies every spice in the stew. Likewise Jean, who is apt to say \"I have a friend, well, acquaintance really\" before recounting some frightful faux pas like a gold washbasin. \"I couldn't use it. It was just too much!\" How fortunate then that it was not a gold loo. </p> <p>Snobs was made by September Films, who specialise in electronic gossip, snippety bits dovetailed together so contributors can sneer at other contributors behind their backs. The trick, as in all gossip, is to find someone so ineffable that everybody hates them and piles in like a rugger scrum. Jean Broke-Smith was sniffy about Gemma Collins, a bouncy 18-year-old Essex temp, (\"I 'ave 'ad elocution lessons on 'ow to speak nicely. You know. Farther's cah's a Jaguah. I can say 'Pass the crudettes, darling!'\") Brian Sewell was sniffy about Miss Broke-Smith and her banana and, oh, everything, including snobbery. Mr Sewell (\"A Member of a Shop! Its enough to send us all to Marks and Spencer\") could go on as Lady Bracknell without rehearsal. </p> <p>It moved along at a fair old lick giving you no time to argue with the commentary, \"We all aspire to the lifestyle of the celebrity-packed, football-kicking glitterati\" and \"When did you see a daffodil looking down at the chrysanths in the next bed?\" Not in the same season. </p> <p>Here's a useful tip from a bespoke bootmaker. For a high shine, polish your shoes with Dom Perignon. Now will the bespoke tailor be a dear and tell me why, before cutting out a suit, he rubbed his huge scissors across his hair? Was this to oil them or was he just scratching? </p> <p>A new series of <strong> Meet The Ancestors</strong> (BBC2) began with the discovery of a Roman tomb in Spitalfields. The coffin, two tons of lead and stone, was so magnificent that a director of the London Museum immediately assumed it must be for a man. The girl rose like an affronted ghost to contradict him. She was in her early twenties and dressed in damask, shot through with pure gold. Damask probably only survives today as table linen. (Hermione Gingold used to have a tongue-twisting revue sketch about two dozen double damask dinner napkins). John Wild, a textile expert, was moved close to poetry describing it. \"You've got to imagine somebody walking down the street with this on and the lights shining and, every time they move, you've got a shimmer in the pattern. There is no colour differentiation. Everything is done with the way the light falls and the way the light reflects. It would have looked absolutely fantastic.\" </p> <p>So, she walked in beauty. Everything about her suggests beauty, the jet ornaments for her raven hair, the bottles of perfume, Venus scallop shells on her coffin. Her pronounced Roman nose is not to modern taste but it would obviously appeal to a Roman. The oxygen isotopes in her teeth indicate she was Mediterranean by birth so perhaps she came as a bride. The ceremonial splendour of her robe suggests a wedding dress to me and her early death, childbirth. But what do I know? Or, indeed, anyone.</p>",

We see a bloke suspiciously hanging round a car (a Daewoo) then climbing in and driving off in it, as an earnest voiceover explains that \"every year, 1000s of cars are taken from their owners' homes or places of work...\" Seconds later, we see the same bloke drive back into the same parking spot in a different car. The voiceover continues \"...and replaced by virtually identical ones without anyone noticing.\" </p> <p><strong> The jargon:</strong> This is one of three new 30-second ads aimed at highlighting different elements of Daewoo's \"customer service offering\" (sic) in an interesting and arresting manner. This one focuses on the fact that drivers get a free courtesy car, delivered to wherever they want, when they have their Daewoo serviced. </p> <p><strong> Personality:</strong> Far from being boy racers, Daewoo owners and potential owners are rather cautious, conservative, older individuals who want a worry-free drive that will safely get them from A to B rather than any fancy badge motor. </p> <p><strong> Financial status:</strong> You must be fairly affluent, given that you are buying a new car, although you're obviously not in the BMW/Mercedes bracket. You are comfortably off but not rich, says Daewoo's agency Duckworth Finn. </p> <p><strong> Telling lifestyle detail:</strong> You could be a bit anoraky, given Daewoo's various customer safety pledges and the fact they are sold through their own network rather than rip-off franchised dealers. You are also of no particular age group or demographic, but the odds are you're no longer in your twenties and you don't live in Camden. </p> <p><strong> Other relevant data:</strong> The ad was shot on real CCTV cameras in an underground car park in Paddington. It was actually directed by Daniel Kleinman, the man who did the credits to the latest Bond movie.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ad: This simple commercial looks like it uses genuine security camera footage, shot in an underground car park. We see a bloke suspiciously hanging round a car (a Daewoo) then climbing in and driving off in it, as an earnest voiceover explains that \"every year, 1000s of cars are taken from their owners' homes or places of work...\" Seconds later, we see the same bloke drive back into the same parking spot in a different car. The voiceover continues \"...and replaced by virtually identical ones without anyone noticing.\" The jargon: This is one of three new 30-second ads aimed at highlighting different elements of Daewoo's \"customer service offering\" (sic) in an interesting and arresting manner. This one focuses on the fact that drivers get a free courtesy car, delivered to wherever they want, when they have their Daewoo serviced. Personality: Far from being boy racers, Daewoo owners and potential owners are rather cautious, conservative, older individuals who want a worry-free drive that will safely get them from A to B rather than any fancy badge motor. Financial status: You must be fairly affluent, given that you are buying a new car, although you're obviously not in the BMW/Mercedes bracket. You are comfortably off but not rich, says Daewoo's agency Duckworth Finn. Telling lifestyle detail: You could be a bit anoraky, given Daewoo's various customer safety pledges and the fact they are sold through their own network rather than rip-off franchised dealers. You are also of no particular age group or demographic, but the odds are you're no longer in your twenties and you don't live in Camden. Other relevant data: The ad was shot on real CCTV cameras in an underground car park in Paddington. It was actually directed by Daniel Kleinman, the man who did the credits to the latest Bond movie.",

The rally's chief organiser, Hubert Auriol, told France-Info radio that the round-the-clock airlift, stretching across 1,250 miles from the Niger capital Niamey to Sebah in Libya, will require 18 round trips by Sunday at a cost of $4.7m. The rally was halted in Niamey on Tuesday after warnings from Washington and Paris that 300 Algerian Muslim guerrillas planned to ambush the race in Niger, a section of the race that will now be bypassed. The guerrillas, thought to be a breakaway wing of the Muslim Armed Islamic Group (GIA), were intent on seeking revenge against the Niger army, which in 1998 was involved in an Algerian campaign to flush them out, Mr Auriol said. He said the guerrillas were heavily armed and had some 40 four-wheel-drive vehicles, but he stressed that the rally was not in danger as long as it did not try to leave Niamey. GIA guerrillas have been linked to the slaughter of villagers and the deaths of dozens of foreigners in Algeria's eight-year-old civil strife, which has cost 100,000 lives.

In a concession to republicans, Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland secretary, announced that Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness are to be given up to \u00a3100,000 to run offices at the Palace of Westminster. His move placed the government at odds with the Commons speaker, Betty Boothroyd. Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons, who will call for Sinn Fein to be admitted to Westminster in a Commons debate, said last night that Ms Boothroyd was opposed to the move. The speaker banned Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness from the Palace of Westminster soon after their election in 1997 because of their refusal to swear the oath of allegiance to the Queen. Mr Adams, Sinn Fein president and MP for West Belfast, signalled during the 1997 election campaign that republicans would water down their boycott of Westminster. Under the policy, which he described as \"active abstentionism\", Mr Adams said that Sinn Fein would use every facility short of taking seats in the chamber. But Ms Boothroyd ended Sinn Fein's \"active abstentionism\" within two weeks of the general election. The government now believes that the climate has changed. In a letter to Northern Ireland's political leaders, Mr Mandelson said: \"I believe it is now time to look again at how [Sinn Fein] should be treated at Westminster. It will enable Sinn Fein members to associate with a broad spectrum of democratic representatives from across the UK and assist in their development as a party committed to democratic and peaceful means.\" Sinn Fein welcomed Mr Mandelson's letter. \"It's no less than what we were entitled to from the day and hour our MPs were elected,\" a spokesman said.

His dual connection with the Arden Shakespeare, on which his reputation rests, began in the 1950s, first with the commission to edit Hamlet and then with the appointment as joint general editor of the series (with Harold Brooks) in 1958.

It combines his characteristic acumen, clarity of mind, and firmness of judgment as a textual scholar with a fine critical sensibility not found in all editors. The \"Longer notes\", which extend to more than 100 pages at the end of the volume, constitute in themselves not only a wealth of scholarship, but also a forceful and persuasive reading of the play, enriched in many places by a lifetime's theatre-going experience.</p> <p>Jenkins grew up in Shenley, Buckinghamshire, the son of a dairyman. He was the eldest boy in a family of five children and, showing intellectual promise, started school at three. He attended Wolverton grammar school, and then read English at University College, London.</p> <p>He was always a single-minded and clearly (though not narrowly) focused scholar who developed early on his interest in the literature of the Elizabethan period. His MA thesis, The Life and Work of Henry Chettle, was published in 1934.</p> <p>After a year at the University of Liverpool in 1935 he became lecturer in English at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. Ten years later he returned to London to begin 22 years of teaching at the University of London.</p> <p>His courtesy and brilliance as a lecturer marked the whole of his career, and no one who has been his student will forget his lectures, which were outstanding for their wit and vivacity, as well as their clarity of analysis.</p> <p>In 1954 he moved from Universtity College to West field College as the first chair of English, where he reigned supreme until 1967, when he became regius professor of rhetoric and English at the University of Edinburgh, a post he held until retirement in 1971. He spent a year in America as visiting professor at Duke University from 1957-58, and a year at the University of Oslo in 1974. In 1986 he was honoured by the award of the Shakespeare prize of the FVS Foundation of Hamburg, the first time it had gone to a scholar-editor.</p> <p>All of his scholarly work shares the qualities of insight, critical integrity, and scrupulous attention to detail. He was perhaps unlucky in that the edition appeared in a critical climate no longer so receptive to its peculiar virtues, but it will always constitute a standard against which other editions must measure themselves.</p> <p>In the course of his career he travelled extensively, often with his wife Gladys, whom he met when they were both students. It was a real marriage of \"true minds\", which sustained Jenkins for most of his academic career. In his preface to Hamlet he acknowledges her with great warmth, paying tribute to their \"daily conversation\", which fed constantly into his work. Their intimacy may have been the greater because their marriage was childless.</p> <p>In 1983 they travelled together to China, a dream re alised, but the next year Gladys was killed in a road accident. Jenkins was devastated, but rebuilt his life with a quiet fortitude.</p> <p>His nature as a man partly reflected that of his scholarship; he was elegant and fastidious, discriminating in his tastes and his dress, sometimes acerbic, though always measured and polite. But he was also someone who loved congenial company, good conversation, entertaining friends at the Athenaeum, and good food and wine. He was a witty and charming host.</p> <p>\u0095 Harold Jenkins, Shakespeare scholar and editor, born July 19 1909; died January 4 2000</p>",

Jenkins grew up in Shenley, Buckinghamshire, the son of a dairyman. He was the eldest boy in a family of five children and, showing intellectual promise, started school at three. He attended Wolverton grammar school, and then read English at University College, London. He was always a single-minded and clearly (though not narrowly) focused scholar who developed early on his interest in the literature of the Elizabethan period. His MA thesis, The Life and Work of Henry Chettle, was published in 1934. After a year at the University of Liverpool in 1935 he became lecturer in English at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. Ten years later he returned to London to begin 22 years of teaching at the University of London. His courtesy and brilliance as a lecturer marked the whole of his career, and no one who has been his student will forget his lectures, which were outstanding for their wit and vivacity, as well as their clarity of analysis. In 1954 he moved from Universtity College to West field College as the first chair of English, where he reigned supreme until 1967, when he became regius professor of rhetoric and English at the University of Edinburgh, a post he held until retirement in 1971. He spent a year in America as visiting professor at Duke University from 1957-58, and a year at the University of Oslo in 1974. In 1986 he was honoured by the award of the Shakespeare prize of the FVS Foundation of Hamburg, the first time it had gone to a scholar-editor. All of his scholarly work shares the qualities of insight, critical integrity, and scrupulous attention to detail. He was perhaps unlucky in that the edition appeared in a critical climate no longer so receptive to its peculiar virtues, but it will always constitute a standard against which other editions must measure themselves. In the course of his career he travelled extensively, often with his wife Gladys, whom he met when they were both students. It was a real marriage of \"true minds\", which sustained Jenkins for most of his academic career. In his preface to Hamlet he acknowledges her with great warmth, paying tribute to their \"daily conversation\", which fed constantly into his work. Their intimacy may have been the greater because their marriage was childless. In 1983 they travelled together to China, a dream re alised, but the next year Gladys was killed in a road accident. Jenkins was devastated, but rebuilt his life with a quiet fortitude. His nature as a man partly reflected that of his scholarship; he was elegant and fastidious, discriminating in his tastes and his dress, sometimes acerbic, though always measured and polite. But he was also someone who loved congenial company, good conversation, entertaining friends at the Athenaeum, and good food and wine. He was a witty and charming host. \u0095 Harold Jenkins, Shakespeare scholar and editor, born July 19 1909; died January 4 2000",

Labour's leader, Tony Blair, sent a message to the annual conference of the Democratic Left, the largest party in Italy's ruling coalition, blessing its transformation into a modernising ally. Leaders of the Democratic Left are so enchanted by Mr Blair's success that they have imported a British pop star and used an English-language slogan - \"I care\" - for their four-day conference, which began yesterday in Turin. The platform's traditional red backdrop has been banished for a more conservative blue setting, from which controversial ideas about spending cuts, privatisation and labour market flexibility will be pitched above the grinding of old guard teeth. No references to the working class are expected in any speeches, which have been tailored for television. Sting will sing John Lennon's Imagine and, in a deviation from Millbank's manual, Sabrina Ferilli, an actor and Italy's most popular nude pin-up, will make an appearance. Critics accused the Democratic Left of resorting to gimmicks in a desperate attempt to compete with the lustre of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the centre-right coalition that is expected to oust the ruling centre-left administration at the next general election, due within 18 months. \"Considering it was once a very strong party, like those that existed only in Europe, this is ridiculous,\" said Sandro Roventi, political analyst at Milan's Bocconi university. \"The party simultaneously lost its ideology and its capability of organising. Now it doesn't know what to do.\" The former Communist party abandoned its name, its Marxist rhetoric, and its hammer and sickle after the fall of the Berlin wall, but has struggled to broaden its appeal since gaining power, with a gaggle of smaller parties, in 1996. Massimo D'Alema, the prime minister, has been accused by internal critics of following Mr Blair's \"third way\" philosophy because he can think of no other way forward. Nearly 3,000 delegates were present to hear the British prime minister's words of encouragement, which were played to the conference hall. \"We believe in solidarity, we believe in opportunity for all, we believe in a strong civil society but we also need to modernise our social system, our economy, to become part of the new economy of the future,\" he said.",

For much of her eagerly anticipated appearance on Wednesday night - itself the subject of a running gag for three weeks on the ratings-topping show - she and Mr Letterman exchanged gentle one-liners.

The launch will be an all-guns-blazing political event, attended both by President Bill Clinton and by the couple's daughter, Chelsea. Her appearance on the Letterman show came just days after Mrs Clinton moved out of the White House and into the new family home in New York to concentrate on her bid for the November election, and amid polls which show her trailing badly behind her likely Republican rival, the New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. Such pressures only add to the certainty that the race will break all previous spending records for a senate contest, a record currently held by the 1998 New York senate contest between the Republican Al D'Amato and the Democratic victor, Charles Schumer. Shocking though it may seem to political traditionalists, Mrs Clinton's apparent reluctance to submit herself to 20 minutes of teasing by Mr Letterman, whose late night CBS talk show is broadcast from a theatre on Broadway in the heart of Manhattan, had become increasingly embarrassing for her. Unlike Mr Giuliani, who would appear every night of the week on any show if he could, Mrs Clinton had fought shy of Mr Letterman's increasingly frenzied attempts to book her.

Yeah, it sounds like Charlotte could do with someone to drum her up some extra cash. Come now, she only gets \u00a350 a month pocket money and won't have access to her earnings until she is 22. I take it the teen sensation will be managed by her mother. Maria says not. However, when her daughter became famous she gave up her job as a council housing officer to act as her PA, and is understood to want a more prominent role in her daughter's career. Keeping it the family? Yup. Her dad is also on the Sony payroll, combining ordinary paternal duties with official status as her chaperone. Very cosy. \"I like to think Maria and myself have helped to model Charlotte into the person she is today,\" says James Church. Do say: \"A girl's best friend is her mother.\" Don't say: \"Didn't the Spice Girls' sacked manager hit them for a \u00a315m payoff?\" Not to be confused with: Charlotte's Web, the Charlatans, church.",

BASF has been there since 1865; the taxes the company pays and the 40,000 jobs it provides ensure a good standard of living for the vast majority of Ludwigshafeners; its concern for the environment, forced upon it after a series of chemical industry disasters, means the air is clean, too.

A man called Martin Langham, who used to be a British Caledonian trolley dolly - cabin crew for those who live in a camp-free world - is starting a \"gay-friendly\" airline called Freedom Airways.</p> <p>It's going to fly out of Manchester, which is very homosexual in these post-industrial days when warehouses become bars, banking halls become cafes and gays have become a tool of economic regeneration. It will also leave from Luton.</p> <p>Now, forgive me if I've made a mistake about the idea of gay-friendly travel, but when was the last time you met a heterosexual male flight attendant? Some years ago, in a restaurant in Brighton, I watched a line of stewardesses descend the stairs in bright-red livery macs, followed by just one steward who was wearing a beige one. When I asked why he wasn't in red he replied defensively: \"Because it's not very masculine.\" That is the last time I, or anyone I know, came across one.</p> <p>The meal service on Virgin Atlantic is like the late show at the Copacabana. Most of the cabin crew ask the question \"Meat or fish?\" in a distinctly suggestive way and add with a camp sneer: \"Or would sir like the vegetarian alternative?\" The implication is that it would be terribly downmarket were one to say yes. So I have always thought flying was a very gay experience.</p> <p>But according to Langham it's not. He fell asleep on his partner's shoulder flying back from Bali on \"a major airline\". He was woken by one of the cabin staff and asked not to be so intimate. We're not talking the mile-high club here. We're talking teddy-bear-aah-sleepy-byes.</p> <p>I once had sex with a Buddhist on a Qantas flight to Australia. Not only did the earth move but I also came back as something entirely different in another life. Now everytime I hit turbulence I think of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.</p> <p>In that case it would have been entirely reasonable for the crew to have intervened. But Langham was just sleeping and the attitude of this airline was outrageous. That is what needs changing and he could just have started a campaign. Instead, he has gone charmingly over the top and become like Victor Kiam, the man in the Remington ads: \"I hated the airline so much, I started one of my own.\"</p> <p>So do we need a gay airline? We need a gay lobby like Stonewall to tackle disrimination. We need gay bars because, although people say you meet men at dinner parties, you don't. But an airline?</p> <p>First, several of the top airlines deny that they give any such instructions to cabin staff. Virgin says it wouldn't dream of interfering if two passengers were obviously a couple. The more matronly British Airways had to consult but its spokesman came back and said the same.</p> <p>However, I don't doubt Langham's experience for a moment. Every gay person has suffered being told, in a double entendre that would moisten Freud's consulting chair, not to shove their sexuality down everybody's throat. He probably bumped up against an airborne version of Anne Widdecombe. Although if he had, he would have been flying Aeroflot or Swissair. Their hostesses look like the heroic members of the People's Union of Agricultural Workers (women's branch) that you see in Soviet art posing next to a socialist realist tractor. But if he's right that some gay people would rather travel with other gays, then good luck to him.</p> <p>I can imagine nothing worse than travelling on a gay-only airline. It would be double entendre hell for a start. You can imagine what would happen the minute the captain announced that the plane had started to go down. If we landed in the sea some idiot would suggest synchronised swimming to land. And the duty-free would always be fresh out of Calvin Klein by the time it reached Economy.</p> <p>Some gays and lesbians love queer-only spaces. Me, I find the pressure a bit much. Far more fun to sit and fantasise about the man three rows in front: what he's going to do in Australia when he gets there; what colour we'll paint our bedroom in the house we'll certainly buy when we fall in life-long love; what kind of puppy we'll have. Better that than meet him and find out he's some naff queen from Harlesden, with Capo Di Monte china and three chihuahuas at home.</p> <p>Although if that's what I am worried about, maybe I should fly Freedom Airlines from Manchester and not Luton. But I'd prefer to fly on a major world airline with everybody else and tell them to get stuffed if they try to stop me loving my boyfriend.</p>",

We need a gay lobby like Stonewall to tackle disrimination. We need gay bars because, although people say you meet men at dinner parties, you don't. But an airline? First, several of the top airlines deny that they give any such instructions to cabin staff. Virgin says it wouldn't dream of interfering if two passengers were obviously a couple. The more matronly British Airways had to consult but its spokesman came back and said the same. However, I don't doubt Langham's experience for a moment. Every gay person has suffered being told, in a double entendre that would moisten Freud's consulting chair, not to shove their sexuality down everybody's throat. He probably bumped up against an airborne version of Anne Widdecombe. Although if he had, he would have been flying Aeroflot or Swissair. Their hostesses look like the heroic members of the People's Union of Agricultural Workers (women's branch) that you see in Soviet art posing next to a socialist realist tractor. But if he's right that some gay people would rather travel with other gays, then good luck to him. I can imagine nothing worse than travelling on a gay-only airline. It would be double entendre hell for a start. You can imagine what would happen the minute the captain announced that the plane had started to go down. If we landed in the sea some idiot would suggest synchronised swimming to land. And the duty-free would always be fresh out of Calvin Klein by the time it reached Economy. Some gays and lesbians love queer-only spaces. Me, I find the pressure a bit much. Far more fun to sit and fantasise about the man three rows in front: what he's going to do in Australia when he gets there; what colour we'll paint our bedroom in the house we'll certainly buy when we fall in life-long love; what kind of puppy we'll have. Better that than meet him and find out he's some naff queen from Harlesden, with Capo Di Monte china and three chihuahuas at home. Although if that's what I am worried about, maybe I should fly Freedom Airlines from Manchester and not Luton. But I'd prefer to fly on a major world airline with everybody else and tell them to get stuffed if they try to stop me loving my boyfriend.",

I have always put her first but do have a social life.</p> <p>We have had a reasonably good relationship, although she is strong-willed and rude at times. I have had one or two boyfriends but kept them out of her life. Six months ago I fell in love with a wonderful man and we want to spend our lives together. To start with, we saw each other when my daughter was not around, although she knew I was seeing him. Gradually the three of us spent more time together and they appeared to be getting on quite well. But recently she has started being rude to him. I'm being pulled apart. I understand this would be a big change but other people seem to work it out with children and new partners. He says I should not let my life be run by a 10-year-old. What should I do?</p> <p><b> He must be patient</b><br> I am also a single parent, though my daughter is 13. She, too, can sometimes be rude - and on occasions appear strongwilled. It is true, though, don't you think, that we can only really be ourselves with those with whom we feel most secure?</p> <p>You say she has had your undivided attention all her life but she is still only 10. Think how swiftly that time has passed and how soon it will be that she is no longer a child. You are right that other people seem to manage with new partners and children.</p> <p>However, for every couple that succeeds many others fail. Believe me - because I have been down that path - a relationship between your child and a new partner is never going to be easy. Most especially when that child has reached an age that brings so many natural changes for her. These changes are in themselves difficult enough without the inevitable emotional upheaval of accepting that she has to share you with a live-in third party. Sure, your daughter seemed to get along with your new man fairly well at first, but I would be willing to bet that this was before it became obvious that this man would shortly become a more permanent fixture around your home.</p> <p>I know this is probably not the sort of thing you were hoping to hear. If, as you stated in your letter, you and your partner are truly in love, then the few more years that it might take for your daughter to come through this difficult time, represents a tiny drop in the bucket, in comparison to the rest of your lives. Right now, though, it is less a case of allowing a 10-year-old to dictate your life than of putting the needs of a child first.</p> <p>If this man is worthy of your love and the respect of your daughter, he will readily understand. True love is always patient.<br> <b>Paul Glendenning</b><br>Merseyside</p> <p><b> Live your own life</b><br> It is only natural that your daughter should feel threatened by your new-found happiness - after all, you are both taking a step into the unknown. While you are sure of your new relationship and feel you can spend the rest of your life with this man, your daughter will be feeling very much an outsider, however hard you try to include her. However, I do feel it is very important for you to pursue the relationship with your new partner. Several years ago, I very nearly lost the man I love after we spent our first holiday together with my son from my first marriage. My son behaved extremely badly towards my new partner and we spent most of our holiday apart, vowing to separate when we returned home.</p> <p>Thankfully, we decided to try again and although my son will never be as close to my second husband as to his own father, I am happy to say that they now get on very well, with a great deal of respect and understanding on both sides.</p> <p>Yes, it is important that you continue to show your daughter how important she is to you, but it is also important to live your own life and don't let her ruin your chance of a wonderful future.

Try and see things from her point of view. She is suddenly having to compete for her mother's attention with a man she hardly knows but with whom you are smitten. You say they \"appeared to be getting on quite well\" at first. That doesn't sound like much of a relationship. Does he like children? Has he much experience of them? How does he relate to her?</p> <p>He must realise that you are a package and unless he and she start to like each other, it will be setting up trouble for all three if you rush into a commitment.</p> <p>Can you talk to your daughter and ask her how she feels? Really listen to what she says. Perhaps she is anxious because she thinks that because you love him you will love her less. Rudeness and bad behaviour are often a response to insecurity. Bear this in mind, too, that 10 is the verge of adolescence and all the problems that brings - especially in relation to the male of the species.</p> <p>Can you talk to your child's father about the situation? Perhaps he could spent extra time with her - and help reassure her. <br> <b>Sara Rigg</b><br> North London</p> <p><b>Next week</b><br> I am 37, have been married 11 years and have two daughters.

      "body": "<p>On an old army base 15 minutes from central Copenhagen, something is stirring. Peter \u00c5alb\u00e6k Jensen, partner-in-crime of the mercurial Lars von Trier at Zentropa Enterprises - producers of, among others, Breaking the Waves, The Idiots and Mifune - glances at a press release detailing the company's achievements. A smirk inches across his face.</p> <p>\"Bullshit and lies,\" declares the self-proclaimed \"spade guy\" of Dogme 95, bustling outside into the Danish mid-winter, where the rain daubs the concrete walls of the surrounding soundstages. He scans the hive of buildings around him. \"Look at it. Built to withstand a small atomic blast.\" The man in day-to-day control of Dogme's next step pauses, grinning in the downpour. \"Welcome to Film City.\" </p> <p>But let's put that on hold for a moment. Because, despite the hubbub created by Dogme's stripping of film-making technique to its bare essentials of actor, camera and - occasionally - script, the story of Danish cinema doesn't begin with Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg (director of last year's acclaimed Festen) putting pen to paper on the back-to-basics Vows of Chastity in March 1995.</p> <p>Take the impending Danish film season, of which a healthy slice is devoted to rarely-seen nuggets from the country's celluloid past. There, for example, you'll find The Abyss, the 1910 silent which made a star of its quaintly salacious leading lady, Asta Nielsen; 1961's Harry and the Butler, featuring Festen's malignant patriarch Henning Moritzen; and My Metier, an appropriately intense documentary portrait of Carl Dreyer, Denmark's first globally renowned film-maker. </p> <p>\"Part of the thinking behind the festival,\" explains Michael S\u00f8by, the Danish embassy's exuberant cultural attach\u00e9, \"is illustrating the continuity of our film industry, from the silent era up to the present and into the future. And, of course, Dogme is a wonderful chapter in that tale. But it's only one chapter.\" </p> <p>So, while the plaudits, abuse and all-purpose column inches inspired by Dogme's playful sedition have helped propel Danish film beyond the genteel vistas of arthouse buffery, Denmark has already prepared itself for life after the media. Which, in practical terms, involves ensuring audiences in \u00c5rhus, Alborg and downtown Odense keep watching movies made in \u00c5rhus, Alborg and downtown Odense. </p> <p>\"Obviously,\" S\u00f8by continues, \"if a country of five million people wants to compete with Hollywood, it has to have a really strong network of producers and distributors, which is why the government is investing so heavily in both. If Danish cinema is to thrive, Danes have to be able to see their own movies.\" And, yes, that includes the still-newsworthy fruit of Dogme. But it also means everything from twentysomething enfant terrible Nicolas Winding Refn's savage, immaculate Bleeder to the stately costume dramas of Nordisk Film. </p> <p>Sitting in the company's spruce office space, Nordisk's amiably gruff supremo Erik Crone echoes S\u00f8by's thoughts. \"Initially, we look to succeed here,\" he says. \"The more local a film is, the better it is, and the better its chances are of doing well abroad. If you deliberately try and make international films, you usually end up with something no one wants to see.\" </p> <p>With 30 years in the business, Crone's also aware of the fickle nature of the spotlight; he still remembers the late 70s, when Nordisk was obliged to make ends meet with TV sitcoms. \"These days,\" he shrugs, \"the situation is very healthy. But, in a country this small, you can never underestimate the importance of getting by.\"</p> <p>Which is - very nearly - where we came in. After all, if Zentropa and its home on the demilitarised sprawl of Film City were built on anything, it was getting by. In 1989, there wasn't much else Lars von Trier or Peter \u00c5alb\u00e6k Jensen could do; the former was recovering from the tepid reception afforded his morbid meta-drama Epidemic, and the latter, after a brief initial foray into production, was declaring himself bankrupt. </p> <p>\"So, of course, we decided to start a film company,\" beams Jensen. \"We started stealing from the system. All these German commercials agencies would hire Lars to make their shitty ads, and every time we'd botch the job just to give the bill another zero on the end. And because it was Lars, the big-time movie director, and because it was so expensive, they always assumed this stupid ad was something really special.\" </p> <p>It took three years of their \"Robin Hood act\" to find the money for Von Trier's post-war thriller Europa; another three, and Zentropa was the biggest production company in Scandinavia. Right from the outset, Jensen and Von Trier always had more in common than simultaneous career meltdown. \"We were both members of the Danish Communist Party for a long, long time,\" Jensen begins, a smile never far from his lips, \"so Zentropa is based on decentralised Marxist principles. Profits are shared, the tools of production are owned by the people, we operate in small cells across Europe, small guerrilla units which act autonomously but pool resources for major projects...</p> <p>\"We're socialists, you know? We wanted self-sufficiency and survival without bankers.\" As such, Film City probably represents their ideal home. Occupied after \"a bunch of us climbed over the fence\" on New Year's Day 1999, it now boasts numerous offices, a three-storey house for screenwriters, a cabin for visiting American film-makers, a restaurant, tennis court (\"the only upper-class thing here\"), and three full-size soundstages.</p> <p>What was once the Danish army's fencing hall provides the headquarters for <a href=\"http://www.elektropa.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Elektropa</a>, the company's internet off-shoot, through which Von Trier plans to launch his <a href=\"http://www.armybase.com\" target=\"_NEW\">\"Film University\" website</a> next spring; the on-site cinema complex should be ready by next year. </p> <p>Jensen admits the walls could do with a fresh coat of paint, but \"we've got better things to spend the money on\": principally, you imagine, Dancer in the Dark, the elaborate, spectacularly non-Dogme musical Von Trier recently finished shooting at Film City with a budget of around $50m. </p> <p>Jensen then starts talking about Film City's involvement with the children of the Areb\u00f8re suburb just beyond the complex's gates, and how the 101 TV cameras used for a single scene in Dancer in the Dark were handed out at the local high school with the instruction that \"if you make anything good, we'll sell it for you\". </p> <p>\"We let the kids stay on site to learn media,\" he explains, \"and, Christ, so many of them are so good when they make their films. We let them borrow trucks with $1m worth of equipment loaded in the back, and everything always returns in perfect condition. If you trust these kids, it always pays off - that's the future of Danish movies right there.\" </p> <p>It all sounds great; the only strange thing is that I haven't heard the word Dogme all afternoon. Jensen hesitates. \"It would be great,\" he says eventually, \"if we could have some real, fierce opposition to Dogme. Because it was never supposed to be the norm.\" And so says Thomas Vinterberg. Indeed, having spent the last year since Festen's British release making videos for Blur and suffering \"writer's pillow\" on a screenplay he describes as \"an absurd warning\", the normally garrulous Vinterberg seems reluctant to even mention the subject. </p> <p>\"I really don't want to act as the Dogme spokesman,\" he remarks early on, his tone apologetic. \"Even saying that makes me embarrassed.\" His resolve, however, is not long cracking. \"I know Dogme's lifted Danish film's profile, and I'm glad about that. I'm also glad it's inspired people, and made people angry. But I'm also disappointed. Because, for me, Dogme was designed to be a rescue action from mediocrity - from my own and from that around me. And now it seems Dogme has become part of the bourgeoisie. I'm proud of what we achieved. But the time comes to move on.\" </p> <p>Perhaps predictably, he seizes on the chance to do just that when Film City comes up. Now he's smirking. \"Film City is as much mafia as commune. It's 1968, but it's also a businessman with a black book and a Kalashnikov underneath his desk.\" </p> <p>Still part of the gang, he's quick to clarify himself. \"Which is fine, of course. Peter and Lars have learnt you can't change the world as a bankrupt. </p> <p>He continues: \"I'm not a courageous man, and I'm already terrified of repeating myself. So in 10 years' time, I'm not sure how much worth will be left in the vows for us, for me. And if it just became a cosy retrospective, journeying back to the golden age of Dogme, I think that would be kind of... pathetic.\" He leans forward half-conspiratorially. \"The end of it will be if Mifune is nominated for an Oscar. Because, while that would be fantastic in many ways, it will also be the end of Dogme. They may want us to come and sit at their table, but Hollywood is not Denmark's table, and it can't ever be. Even if it means putting an end to Dogme, we should stay anarchists as long as possible. I guess we'll just have to see how long that is.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Danish Cinema: Past, Present and Future, runs in London from January 21 to March 5, before visiting venues throughout the UK.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>John Sayles is a film-maker who likes to take risks. He talks to Jonathan Romney</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The harshest insult in the book is to call a film-maker \"workmanlike\", but with American independent John Sayles, it might not be such a put-down after all. Sayles is every inch a workman - an artisan, if you prefer. He talks a clean streak of common sense and goes about directing and writing with as much hard pragmatism as anyone in the industry. </p> <p>A dry, rangy man who wears his denim sleeves rolled right up as if he means business, Sayles turns up for interview duty looking about ready to balance the account books, maybe fix a few shelves if there's time. He's held down some jobs in his day - hospital worker, ditch digger, writer for Roger Corman and member of the Amalgamated Butcher Workers and Meat Packers of North America - so you know he can be relied on not to regale you with flim-flam about the mystique of cinema. </p> <p>Sayles has a reputation for telling solid, realist stories with a liberal thrust. He's made films about historic union struggles (Matewan) and corruption in baseball (Eight Men Out). He's made a lesbian coming-out drama (Lianna), a portrait of the 60s generation (Return of the Secaucus Seven, his no-budget first feature), and a sci-fi racial satire (The Brother from Another Planet). But in his last few films, Sayles has increasingly gone out on a narrative limb, rather complicating his old image as a leftwing journalist in film-maker's guise. Sayles is proving a director of extraordinary daring. </p> <p>Lone Star was a multi-stranded Tex-Mex drama that would slip four decades in a single tracking shot, and Men with Guns was a war story set in Latin America, with Spanish dialogue and a metaphysical twist ending. But Sayles's new film, Limbo, is a real leap into the void. For fear of revealing too much about the Alaskan-set drama, suffice to say that halfway through, it hits us with a left-turn of Psycho proportions, then finally leaves us \"well, in limbo. You've never seen so many perplexed brows emerging from a screening.\" Limbo asks a little more of an audience than we're normally used to, Sayles admits. </p> <p>\"Most movies are meant to be about the illusion of risk. You go through all these twists and turns with these characters you care about, but at the end it's Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and of course they've got to get together, or it's Harrison Ford and of course he's not going to die. All the time we've got our seat belts on. In this movie, I am asking you to get emotionally involved with the characters but we don't know what's going to happen to them. I don't even give you any warning that it's gonna change from a nice quiet ride to mortal danger.\" </p> <p>This is not to say that Limbo is a gratuitous weird-out of the Blair Witch school. Like all Sayles's films, it has a grounding in an extraordinary sense of place and community. Within minutes, we not only know the diverse population of this Alaskan town - from theme-park entrepreneurs to salmon cannery workers - but we've even learned the difference between types of fishing technique, between purse-seining and gill-netting. </p> <p>Sayles backs his scripts up with hard research, in this case into the community of Juno, south-east Alaska, where the film was shot. \"Two things I try to do - one is just meet people and talk to them about their jobs, about their life. The other is very practical - I don't want to invent a location that doesn't exist and have to create it. I don't want to have to put trees up and change the beach, so I say, 'Well what's there?' and try to write that into the script.\" </p> <p>Diverse as they are, Sayles's films draw a consistency from the way he works with a regular team - notably composer Mason Daring, a repertory cast that includes Limbo's saturnine co-star David Strathairn, and above all, Sayles's long-time partner Maggie Renzi, who has acted in some of his films and been producer on most of them.</p> <p>\"I couldn't produce a two-car funeral,\" Sayles admits. Even so, his screenwriting necessarily incorporates a canny edge of book-balancing. \"If you really want to make a film, you can rethink it. You find another way to tell a story cheaper - new investors show up miraculously. With Limbo, we just came to Sony Pictures, said here's the script, here's the budget, you know our work, we never go over budget, are you interested? And they said go ahead.\" </p> <p>There's a similar give-and-take to his directing. \"What you try and do is - OK, we've got this much time and this much money, and we're going to stay within that. The actors aren't going to get to ad lib, but I am going to try and set up a situation where they have a little room to move around, listen to each other and not worry too much about the camera. My stuff is 98% preparation, and then there's that 2% that you try to have happen. That's what's interesting, when you say, 'Well, that isn't the way I wrote it, but let's try these things'.\" </p> <p>Sayles learned his dollar sense in the late 70s as a writer for New World Pictures, the Roger Corman factory of low-budget exploiters that produced such alumni as Peter Bogdanovich, Jonathan Demme and Joe Dante. Projects like Piranha and the gangster flick The Lady in Red were object lessons in taking liberties with genre. \"On Battle Beyond the Stars, Corman said, 'If you can make Seven Samurai into a western, you can make it into a science fiction film.' He had another idea to make Mutiny on the Bounty in outer space. Sometimes there's some hybrid vigour you can get into a genre that way.\" </p> <p>As a director, Sayles may be the most consistently go-it-alone film-maker in America, but his business head allows him to write other people's projects to finance his own work. His most recent jobs include an animation feature, and a story about Orson Welles's adventures in postwar Italy, to be directed by Oliver Parker. Then there are the rewrites, often uncredited, among them Apollo 13 - his brief was to put the hard science back into it. He also wrote a giant-insect sci-fi script called Brother Termite for James Cameron - his diametrical opposite as a film-maker but a fellow Corman graduate. \"The great thing working for James is that you can write anything, and if he likes it, he'll find a way to do it - he'll invent technology if he has to.\" </p> <p>Long based in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sayles and Renzi now live \"in a combination of Hoboken, upstate New York, and the road.\" Sayles prefers to avoid Los Angeles, \"a company town\". Although Hollywood values him as a writer, you imagine it might not entirely trust him as a director. \"There's kind of a mutual understanding from very early on,\" he admits, \"that most of the things I want to do as a director probably aren't appropriate for a studio to finance. Once in a while there's some common ground, but sometimes I don't even try showing it to them. I almost never get offered movies to direct, but I get quite a few writing offers. Sometimes I turn things down not because the money's bad or I don't need a job at that moment. I just say, 'This is not a movie I'd go see.'\" </p> <p>You can't imagine Hollywood taking, either, to the political content of Sayles's films, or their moral seriousness. He's generally thought of as a liberal or radical, but in fact, Sayles - raised Catholic in Schenectady, upstate New York - has described his politics as \"survivalist\". \"I grew up in an Italian neighbourhood, and there's a very healthy distrust of politics in Italian culture, which is - if you can't control it, try to keep it away from your life as much as possible. There are these big forces and big winds which are going to come through, and if you're not the guy who can be the top dude and control them, you got to watch out for them, or they'll blow your house down. </p> <p>\"Yes, you have to join in every once in a while - but you have to really read the situation before you join up and join a war or a revolution.\" But in fact, Sayles believes his radical reputation has not adversely affected his relationship with the industry. \"In the US, nobody's that worried about that stuff - the film industry is secure enough in its domination of the globe. I'd say that our movies have been avoided by financiers because of their complexity more often than their political stand. That they're politically conscious has not been a problem, but complexity takes you outside a genre, and the minute you're outside of genre, people think, 'Oh where does this fit in, and who's going to go and see it?' \" </p> <p>Where Sayles can really afford not to worry about genre is in his literary writing, a field he established himself in even before he took to screenplays. He has written three novels, the last one being the Cuban epic Los Gusanos (in 1991), and is putting together a new short story collection. It's no surprise to learn that his literary influences are mainly from the American hard-bitten guys, the likes of Ring Lardner, Nelson Algren, Faulkner and Hemingway. \"To Have and Have Not - there's some wonderful stuff in that book, but once in a while you want to say 'Shut up, Ernie', he's such a pain in the ass.\" </p> <p>Book-writing, of course, is a rare opportunity to forget about book-keeping. For a change, Sayles can allow himself to indulge himself in ways even a James Cameron script might not allow. \"I did the Bay of Pigs invasion in Los Gusanos, and I didn't have to worry, I had tanks, I had guns, I had 5,000 troops with full uniforms and boots. I couldn't have afforded that in the movies.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Limbo opens on January 21.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The harshest insult in the book is to call a film-maker \"workmanlike\", but with American independent John Sayles, it might not be such a put-down after all. Sayles is every inch a workman - an artisan, if you prefer. He talks a clean streak of common sense and goes about directing and writing with as much hard pragmatism as anyone in the industry. A dry, rangy man who wears his denim sleeves rolled right up as if he means business, Sayles turns up for interview duty looking about ready to balance the account books, maybe fix a few shelves if there's time. He's held down some jobs in his day - hospital worker, ditch digger, writer for Roger Corman and member of the Amalgamated Butcher Workers and Meat Packers of North America - so you know he can be relied on not to regale you with flim-flam about the mystique of cinema. Sayles has a reputation for telling solid, realist stories with a liberal thrust. He's made films about historic union struggles (Matewan) and corruption in baseball (Eight Men Out). He's made a lesbian coming-out drama (Lianna), a portrait of the 60s generation (Return of the Secaucus Seven, his no-budget first feature), and a sci-fi racial satire (The Brother from Another Planet). But in his last few films, Sayles has increasingly gone out on a narrative limb, rather complicating his old image as a leftwing journalist in film-maker's guise. Sayles is proving a director of extraordinary daring. Lone Star was a multi-stranded Tex-Mex drama that would slip four decades in a single tracking shot, and Men with Guns was a war story set in Latin America, with Spanish dialogue and a metaphysical twist ending. But Sayles's new film, Limbo, is a real leap into the void. For fear of revealing too much about the Alaskan-set drama, suffice to say that halfway through, it hits us with a left-turn of Psycho proportions, then finally leaves us \"well, in limbo. You've never seen so many perplexed brows emerging from a screening.\" Limbo asks a little more of an audience than we're normally used to, Sayles admits. \"Most movies are meant to be about the illusion of risk. You go through all these twists and turns with these characters you care about, but at the end it's Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and of course they've got to get together, or it's Harrison Ford and of course he's not going to die. All the time we've got our seat belts on. In this movie, I am asking you to get emotionally involved with the characters but we don't know what's going to happen to them. I don't even give you any warning that it's gonna change from a nice quiet ride to mortal danger.\" This is not to say that Limbo is a gratuitous weird-out of the Blair Witch school. Like all Sayles's films, it has a grounding in an extraordinary sense of place and community. Within minutes, we not only know the diverse population of this Alaskan town - from theme-park entrepreneurs to salmon cannery workers - but we've even learned the difference between types of fishing technique, between purse-seining and gill-netting.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I 'm waiting for William H Macy outside a restaurant in west Los Angeles, when suddenly he's right there in front of me, no introductions, saying, \"You know, if we sit inside, we can have beer.\" Out comes the hand, \"Hi, Bill Macy. I spotted the tape-recorder, figured it was you.\" </p> <p>\"Alcohol before dark, Bill? You're not from LA, are you?\" </p> <p>\"Hell, no.\" </p> <p>In we go. </p> <p>No, William H Macy isn't from Los Angeles. But he's not from North Dakota or Wisconsin either, as fans of his breakthrough movie Fargo might assume. Nor is he originally from Chicago, where he served his long theatrical apprenticeship with David Mamet's famous St Nicholas company, though that is the city called to mind by his always intriguing midwestern face, a once-in-a-lifetime combination of weak and strong features, soft flesh and sudden right angles.</p> <p>He is surely the world's least ethnic actor - \"I'm a Lutheran down to my socks,\" he once said - which makes him ideal for put-upon white guys, bureaucrats, sleazy private dicks, low-level politicians, salesmen, lawyers and beautiful losers. Since Fargo, his name on a movie has been one of those reassuring elements that tend to suggest the movie in question might actually be worth watching. </p> <p>Like most actors, Macy is shorter and slighter than he appears on screen, in his case possibly because the camera tends to fetishise his face (and the waves of anxiety that seem perpetually to be breaking across it) at the expense of his body - thus making him seem gigantic. He's about my height, five-nine, five-ten and slender, with small hands. Today he's sporting a moustache which brings the competing planes of his physiognomy into amiable focus. </p> <p>\"We need beer,\" he tells the waiter as we settle into our spacious red leather booth. \"And beer soakage materials, too, like fries or whatever, but mainly beer.\" </p> <p>It's a big week for Macy. His latest movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, has been out for a week's limited release to qualify for the Academy awards, and he's extremely proud of both his own performance and particularly of his director, who's only half Macy's age. \"I mean, just where does he get off being so damn talented?\" he asks in mock exasperation. He's also preparing to bring a revival of Mamet's 1970s masterpiece, American Buffalo, to the Donmar Warehouse in London, the first American production here since Al Pacino brought it over in 1983. </p> <p>\"This is a sweet project for me,\" he beams, \"because Mamet's such an old pal of mine.\" Playing the role of Bobby, which Macy himself played in Buffalo's original Chicago production, is fellow Magnolia star and PT Anderson perennial Philip Baker Hall, another of America's great, underused character actors (his Richard Nixon in Robert Altman's Secret Honor is a monumental creation, one that would eat a lesser actor alive).</p> <p>Macy remembers when he first read the play. He and Mamet had co-founded the St Nicholas Company in the Windy City, having met some years earlier at Goddard College. Mamet was a teaching instructor in theatre who took Macy on as his student assistant (born in 1950, Macy's about four years younger than Mamet). After leaving Goddard and drifting around the country for a while, he and Mamet teamed up again, rented a space and started putting on plays of their own. </p> <p>\"One time Dave just totally disappeared for a month or so and then just as suddenly reappeared. I met him in a bar and said, 'Where the hell have you been?' And he slapped down this huge manuscript, and says, 'Check it out, I just finished it.' That was American Buffalo. Oh, Lord, did I want the role of Bobby - and I got it. American Buffalo got me my Equity card, so to go back and play Teach - what? - 25 years later, that's pretty sweet.\" </p> <p>He was instantly gripped by the staccato rhythms and fractured cadences of Mamet's bracingly foul-mouthed dialogue. \"With his language, his writing - an excellent analogy is that it's like a sports car, a Porsche or something - it's not the easiest car in the world to drive, but once you've got it down there's so much you can do with it. By the same token, it's difficult to memorise if you're not familiar with his rhythms, be it a Chicago rhythm or a New York City rhythm - and there's a lot of British colloquialisms in his dialogue as well.</p> <p>\"If you're not aware of these rhythms it can be really daunting, but once you know the dialogue perfectly, inside-out, it literally gives you pleasure to speak it. It has so much music in it, the metre is so pleasing that you just love to say it. Whenever I meet another actor who's done Buffalo, we'll start running the lines back and forth, and I don't know of any other play where that's true. 'You did Titus Andronicus? So did I!' Not the same. People love those lines. You get a single word out of place and it all goes to pieces.\" </p> <p>Chicago, he remembers, really had it going on in what he now sees were these pioneering days in American theatre. There were numerous theatre groups engaging in friendly competition, principally the Organic Theatre, the city's main alternative stage, which was frequently graced by such soon-to-be-famous actors as Joe Mantegna, now better known as Mamet's onscreen everyman, and Dennis Franz, who played Teach in Michael Corrente's rather flaccid film adaptation of Buffalo in 1996. Chicago also hosted the famous Second City comedy improv troupe, many of whose members - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray among them - would change American comedy much as Mamet and his acolytes were reinvigorating post-Albee theatre. </p> <p>\"It was totally new. We approached St Nicholas on a pretty ambitious, professional level. We rented a theatre, and built ourselves a theatre company from next to nothing. And for about 10 years in Chicago it was astounding, because no one did a play for any other reason than to put on a play. In New York you do theatre to get to Broadway. In LA you do a play to get into the movies. In Chicago they did a play to do the play. Someone might say, 'Hey this play might make it all the way to New York.' And people would just laugh and say, 'So what?' It wasn't a stepping-stone to anything.\" </p> <p>And considering he was acting, Macy was surprised to find money in his pocket, lots of it. \"I was a working actor with a new car, which is unheard of, but I bought a building too. A working actor - with residential property to his name? I remember raising my glass one time in a bar and saying to all my actor buddies, 'Guys, these are the good old days!' \" </p> <p>After a decade in Chicago, though, Macy was starting to burn out, so he moved to New York, where he still got good parts and steady gigs. \"But I still felt like I was spinning my wheels. I'd get good roles and good reviews, but after a while I started feeling like I was being taken for granted. In New York I was always playing the WASPy asshole guy, the asshole lawyer or the asshole doctor, and my friends would show up backstage and say, 'Man, I really hated you!' Uh... thanks. Or 'Hi Bill, what a prick you were tonight.' Thanks a lot.\" </p> <p>By 1990, having played small roles in a few forgotten movies in the early 80s (Somewhere in Time, anyone?) and an endless stream of commercials and voiceovers, he decided it was time to move to Los Angeles and make a serious bid at getting in the movies. He reasoned that Tinseltown had more to offer than the commercials he was getting (his favourite line was in an ad for Secret deodorant: \"Strong enough for a man... but made for a woman\"). </p> <p>Until he secured Fargo, Macy kept busy with character roles and more substantial parts in Mamet's movies (he's been in almost all of them and was the star of Oleanna, which most closely recreates the Mamet-Macy onstage dynamic, particularly the shuddering, multiple-interrupted language). Although he didn't register fully in the collective consciousness of audiences until Fargo, he can be spotted in numerous big-cast A-feature movies such as The Client, Mr Holland's Opus, Murder in the First, Searching for Bobby Fischer and, rather more visibly, as a featured performer on ER. </p> <p>But when Fargo fell into his lap, he knew immediately what it could do for him, and what he could do for it. \"I basically said to the Coens, 'This is my role - my role - and I'm just scared you guys are gonna fuck it up and cast someone else.' \" When he heard the Coens were continuing their audition process in New York, he got on a plane and showed up again, just to remind them. \"I said, 'It's my role and I'll shoot your dogs if you don't give it to me.' \" He got it. The dogs lived. </p> <p>Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman who concocts a ridiculous, disastrous kidnapping scheme to revive his ailing finances, is probably the most demanding part the Coen brothers have ever written. It requires an actor without a shred of ego, since all Jerry seems to endure is anxiety, mortification and humiliation. As he gets further and further in over his head, Macy's limitlessly expressive face charts the inexorable upsurge of everything Jerry has hitherto refused to face about his daft plot and, more importantly, about himself.</p> <p>One can imagine only a tiny number of major actors who would have emitted the anguished squeal Macy gives out when he's finally arrested crawling out of a motel lavatory window. Along with Fargo, Macy was off to the Oscars - the \"Independent Oscars\", as they were nicknamed that year - with his first supporting actor nomination. I venture to guess there will be more. </p> <p>\"When something like that happens, it takes a year or more before you really get the full impact of it. I don't have to audition any more and, with the exception of my wife, that's the single best thing that's ever happened to me. I get more money, and I haven't been pigeonholed. What's to complain about?\" </p> <p>Certainly not the sudden demand for his talents. He started seeing the hottest new scripts and continued to pick his projects wisely. \"I read Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights script, which was originally much, much racier, and I thought, 'Oh my God, this is pornography!' There were shots of people blowing each other and fucking, but God it was a good script. All the agents were wary of it, and if Paul hadn't been such a brilliant film-maker it could have been just awful. But I had a great meeting with Paul where I thought I was selling myself to him and halfway through, I realised he was selling himself to me. I went and saw his first movie, Hard Eight, that night and told him that if he wanted to direct the phone book, I'd be there first thing Monday morning.\" </p> <p>Mamet and Anderson, he says, both run similar, friendly sets, where egos are kept in their boxes and those who favour screaming as a management technique are off the lot by noon. \"They'd both rather be directing a movie than doing anything else, probably including sex, but they maintain this warm environment that lets things get done. I've found that in Hollywood, assholism comes from the top down. If the producer or director is an asshole, then the people at the craft-services table will be assholes too.\" </p> <p>With Magnolia opening here in March, and the superhero comedy Mystery Men just released - \"too many cooks in that kitchen\" is Macy's verdict on the latter, actually very amusing film - Bill Macy is set to become, however briefly, an omnipresent figure in Britain over the next couple of months. He and Mamet have also just wrapped State and Main, a comedy about a Hollywood production on location in Vermont, with Macy playing the director.</p> <p>\"Lord Almighty, did we have fun. They just destroy this poor town,\" he says of the film, which seems to offer more evidence of Mamet's abiding distaste for Hollywood. \"Yeah, you practically have to sedate him to get him to come to LA.\" Mamet and Macy are also hoping to do a remake of High and Low, Akira Kurosawa's classic 1962 detective thriller (from an Ed McBain novel), about the mistaken kidnapping of a millionaire's chauffeur's son, with Macy playing the chauffeur. </p> <p>In the end, despite his new-found status in Hollywood, it is for Mamet that Macy reserves his highest praise. \"He wasn't just my mentor, he also gave me my career,\" he says with unaffected feeling and gratitude evident in his voice. \"He gave me crucial roles throughout my career. I just wouldn't have made it without him.\"</p> <p>\u0095 American Buffalo runs at the Donmar Warehouse, London, from January 28 to February 26 (tickets: 0171-369 1732).

      "bodyText": "I 'm waiting for William H Macy outside a restaurant in west Los Angeles, when suddenly he's right there in front of me, no introductions, saying, \"You know, if we sit inside, we can have beer.\" Out comes the hand, \"Hi, Bill Macy. I spotted the tape-recorder, figured it was you.\" \"Alcohol before dark, Bill? You're not from LA, are you?\" \"Hell, no.\" In we go. No, William H Macy isn't from Los Angeles. But he's not from North Dakota or Wisconsin either, as fans of his breakthrough movie Fargo might assume. Nor is he originally from Chicago, where he served his long theatrical apprenticeship with David Mamet's famous St Nicholas company, though that is the city called to mind by his always intriguing midwestern face, a once-in-a-lifetime combination of weak and strong features, soft flesh and sudden right angles. He is surely the world's least ethnic actor - \"I'm a Lutheran down to my socks,\" he once said - which makes him ideal for put-upon white guys, bureaucrats, sleazy private dicks, low-level politicians, salesmen, lawyers and beautiful losers. Since Fargo, his name on a movie has been one of those reassuring elements that tend to suggest the movie in question might actually be worth watching. Like most actors, Macy is shorter and slighter than he appears on screen, in his case possibly because the camera tends to fetishise his face (and the waves of anxiety that seem perpetually to be breaking across it) at the expense of his body - thus making him seem gigantic. He's about my height, five-nine, five-ten and slender, with small hands. Today he's sporting a moustache which brings the competing planes of his physiognomy into amiable focus. \"We need beer,\" he tells the waiter as we settle into our spacious red leather booth. \"And beer soakage materials, too, like fries or whatever, but mainly beer.\" It's a big week for Macy. His latest movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, has been out for a week's limited release to qualify for the Academy awards, and he's extremely proud of both his own performance and particularly of his director, who's only half Macy's age. \"I mean, just where does he get off being so damn talented?\" he asks in mock exasperation. He's also preparing to bring a revival of Mamet's 1970s masterpiece, American Buffalo, to the Donmar Warehouse in London, the first American production here since Al Pacino brought it over in 1983. \"This is a sweet project for me,\" he beams, \"because Mamet's such an old pal of mine.\" Playing the role of Bobby, which Macy himself played in Buffalo's original Chicago production, is fellow Magnolia star and PT Anderson perennial Philip Baker Hall, another of America's great, underused character actors (his Richard Nixon in Robert Altman's Secret Honor is a monumental creation, one that would eat a lesser actor alive). Macy remembers when he first read the play. He and Mamet had co-founded the St Nicholas Company in the Windy City, having met some years earlier at Goddard College. Mamet was a teaching instructor in theatre who took Macy on as his student assistant (born in 1950, Macy's about four years younger than Mamet). After leaving Goddard and drifting around the country for a while, he and Mamet teamed up again, rented a space and started putting on plays of their own. \"One time Dave just totally disappeared for a month or so and then just as suddenly reappeared. I met him in a bar and said, 'Where the hell have you been?' And he slapped down this huge manuscript, and says, 'Check it out, I just finished it.' That was American Buffalo. Oh, Lord, did I want the role of Bobby - and I got it. American Buffalo got me my Equity card, so to go back and play Teach - what? - 25 years later, that's pretty sweet.\" He was instantly gripped by the staccato rhythms and fractured cadences of Mamet's bracingly foul-mouthed dialogue. \"With his language, his writing - an excellent analogy is that it's like a sports car, a Porsche or something - it's not the easiest car in the world to drive, but once you've got it down there's so much you can do with it. By the same token, it's difficult to memorise if you're not familiar with his rhythms, be it a Chicago rhythm or a New York City rhythm - and there's a lot of British colloquialisms in his dialogue as well. \"If you're not aware of these rhythms it can be really daunting, but once you know the dialogue perfectly, inside-out, it literally gives you pleasure to speak it. It has so much music in it, the metre is so pleasing that you just love to say it. Whenever I meet another actor who's done Buffalo, we'll start running the lines back and forth, and I don't know of any other play where that's true. 'You did Titus Andronicus? So did I!' Not the same. People love those lines. You get a single word out of place and it all goes to pieces.\" Chicago, he remembers, really had it going on in what he now sees were these pioneering days in American theatre. There were numerous theatre groups engaging in friendly competition, principally the Organic Theatre, the city's main alternative stage, which was frequently graced by such soon-to-be-famous actors as Joe Mantegna, now better known as Mamet's onscreen everyman, and Dennis Franz, who played Teach in Michael Corrente's rather flaccid film adaptation of Buffalo in 1996. Chicago also hosted the famous Second City comedy improv troupe, many of whose members - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray among them - would change American comedy much as Mamet and his acolytes were reinvigorating post-Albee theatre. \"It was totally new. We approached St Nicholas on a pretty ambitious, professional level. We rented a theatre, and built ourselves a theatre company from next to nothing. And for about 10 years in Chicago it was astounding, because no one did a play for any other reason than to put on a play. In New York you do theatre to get to Broadway. In LA you do a play to get into the movies. In Chicago they did a play to do the play. Someone might say, 'Hey this play might make it all the way to New York.' And people would just laugh and say, 'So what?' It wasn't a stepping-stone to anything.\" And considering he was acting, Macy was surprised to find money in his pocket, lots of it. \"I was a working actor with a new car, which is unheard of, but I bought a building too. A working actor - with residential property to his name? I remember raising my glass one time in a bar and saying to all my actor buddies, 'Guys, these are the good old days!' \" After a decade in Chicago, though, Macy was starting to burn out, so he moved to New York, where he still got good parts and steady gigs. \"But I still felt like I was spinning my wheels. I'd get good roles and good reviews, but after a while I started feeling like I was being taken for granted. In New York I was always playing the WASPy asshole guy, the asshole lawyer or the asshole doctor, and my friends would show up backstage and say, 'Man, I really hated you!' Uh... thanks. Or 'Hi Bill, what a prick you were tonight.' Thanks a lot.\" By 1990, having played small roles in a few forgotten movies in the early 80s (Somewhere in Time, anyone?) and an endless stream of commercials and voiceovers, he decided it was time to move to Los Angeles and make a serious bid at getting in the movies. He reasoned that Tinseltown had more to offer than the commercials he was getting (his favourite line was in an ad for Secret deodorant: \"Strong enough for a man... but made for a woman\"). Until he secured Fargo, Macy kept busy with character roles and more substantial parts in Mamet's movies (he's been in almost all of them and was the star of Oleanna, which most closely recreates the Mamet-Macy onstage dynamic, particularly the shuddering, multiple-interrupted language). Although he didn't register fully in the collective consciousness of audiences until Fargo, he can be spotted in numerous big-cast A-feature movies such as The Client, Mr Holland's Opus, Murder in the First, Searching for Bobby Fischer and, rather more visibly, as a featured performer on ER. But when Fargo fell into his lap, he knew immediately what it could do for him, and what he could do for it. \"I basically said to the Coens, 'This is my role - my role - and I'm just scared you guys are gonna fuck it up and cast someone else.' \" When he heard the Coens were continuing their audition process in New York, he got on a plane and showed up again, just to remind them. \"I said, 'It's my role and I'll shoot your dogs if you don't give it to me.' \" He got it. The dogs lived. Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman who concocts a ridiculous, disastrous kidnapping scheme to revive his ailing finances, is probably the most demanding part the Coen brothers have ever written. It requires an actor without a shred of ego, since all Jerry seems to endure is anxiety, mortification and humiliation. As he gets further and further in over his head, Macy's limitlessly expressive face charts the inexorable upsurge of everything Jerry has hitherto refused to face about his daft plot and, more importantly, about himself. One can imagine only a tiny number of major actors who would have emitted the anguished squeal Macy gives out when he's finally arrested crawling out of a motel lavatory window. Along with Fargo, Macy was off to the Oscars - the \"Independent Oscars\", as they were nicknamed that year - with his first supporting actor nomination. I venture to guess there will be more. \"When something like that happens, it takes a year or more before you really get the full impact of it. I don't have to audition any more and, with the exception of my wife, that's the single best thing that's ever happened to me. I get more money, and I haven't been pigeonholed. What's to complain about?\" Certainly not the sudden demand for his talents. He started seeing the hottest new scripts and continued to pick his projects wisely. \"I read Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights script, which was originally much, much racier, and I thought, 'Oh my God, this is pornography!' There were shots of people blowing each other and fucking, but God it was a good script. All the agents were wary of it, and if Paul hadn't been such a brilliant film-maker it could have been just awful. But I had a great meeting with Paul where I thought I was selling myself to him and halfway through, I realised he was selling himself to me. I went and saw his first movie, Hard Eight, that night and told him that if he wanted to direct the phone book, I'd be there first thing Monday morning.\" Mamet and Anderson, he says, both run similar, friendly sets, where egos are kept in their boxes and those who favour screaming as a management technique are off the lot by noon. \"They'd both rather be directing a movie than doing anything else, probably including sex, but they maintain this warm environment that lets things get done. I've found that in Hollywood, assholism comes from the top down. If the producer or director is an asshole, then the people at the craft-services table will be assholes too.\" With Magnolia opening here in March, and the superhero comedy Mystery Men just released - \"too many cooks in that kitchen\" is Macy's verdict on the latter, actually very amusing film - Bill Macy is set to become, however briefly, an omnipresent figure in Britain over the next couple of months. He and Mamet have also just wrapped State and Main, a comedy about a Hollywood production on location in Vermont, with Macy playing the director. \"Lord Almighty, did we have fun. They just destroy this poor town,\" he says of the film, which seems to offer more evidence of Mamet's abiding distaste for Hollywood. \"Yeah, you practically have to sedate him to get him to come to LA.\" Mamet and Macy are also hoping to do a remake of High and Low, Akira Kurosawa's classic 1962 detective thriller (from an Ed McBain novel), about the mistaken kidnapping of a millionaire's chauffeur's son, with Macy playing the chauffeur. In the end, despite his new-found status in Hollywood, it is for Mamet that Macy reserves his highest praise. \"He wasn't just my mentor, he also gave me my career,\" he says with unaffected feeling and gratitude evident in his voice. \"He gave me crucial roles throughout my career. I just wouldn't have made it without him.\" \u0095 American Buffalo runs at the Donmar Warehouse, London, from January 28 to February 26 (tickets: 0171-369 1732). Magnolia will be released in March.",

After The Full Monty, his debut film script, became a global phenomenon in 1997 against all expectations, the gates of Hollywood were wide open to him. Miramax paid a substantial sum for a script they hadn't even seen; he was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar; and his American agent was urging him to do a film version of Run For Your Wife with Hugh Grant and John Cleese. </p> <p>For a 30-year-old British film-maker with no other feature films to his name, this was a dream start. Yet here he is, three years later, with The Darkest Light, a low-budget film about religious visions and agricultural hardship in North Yorkshire, featuring a cast primarily comprised of unknown actors, children and cattle.</p> <p>The Darkest Light also represents Beaufoy's directorial debut, in the company of his long-term partner, Billie Eltringham. \"It was quite interesting to be offered literally millions of dollars to write stupid films, but in the end I realised that Hollywood was not really my world at all,\" Beaufoy says. \"I never got into cinema to be famous or to make lots of money, which is why it's a huge irony that The Full Monty made such a vast sum. I see films as being different from movies. I'm not into movies. I really genuinely want to say something about my view of the world. I don't know whether that sounds pretentious or not but that's why I got into film-making.\" </p> <p>These worthy ambitions were formed at Bournemouth film school, where Beaufoy was studying in the early 90s along with his partners in his company Footprint Films: Eltringham, and The Darkest Light's producer, Mark Blaney. The three have worked together in various configurations since, usually with Beaufoy and Eltringham sharing both writing and directing responsibilities. Their short film and television projects have included Yellow, which starred Ray Winstone, Closer, with Mark Addy, which screened as part of the Brief Encounters series, and the recent Channel 4 drama Kid in the Corner. </p> <p>Beaufoy's primary ambition was to be a documentary-maker; and it was only when he was refused permission to make a documentary about pylon painters in Pembrokeshire that he crossed over into fiction, combining his research and his experiences with climbers in Sheffield, for the 1998 film Among Giants, starring Pete Postlethwaite and Rachel Griffiths. </p> <p>Authenticity has been paramount in his screenwriting, he says, which is why all his scripts have been set in and around Yorkshire, where he grew up. \"To different extents, I knew how these people operated, which is really crucial. I know how they speak, I know how they drink their tea in the morning. I could never do a story set in New York, say.\" </p> <p>The Darkest Light is set even closer to home, among the farming community of north Yorkshire. \"I was always puzzled by television's view of farm life there,\" he says. \"There was a lot of James Herriot going on when I was young. It was all fluffy sheep and idyllic farms, but that wasn't the experience of farmers that I'd had - high suicide rates, divorce, loneliness, people rounding up sheep in four-wheel drive vehicles, chemicals. It's not pretty, it's modern and difficult and generally very, very depressing.\" </p> <p>The Darkest Light is something of a departure, story-wise, from Beaufoy's earlier projects, in that it blends down-to-earth naturalism with spiritual exploration. The principal characters are children: a farmer's daughter, Catherine; her younger brother Matthew, who has leukaemia; and her friend Uma, a Hindu girl. Playing on the moors one day, Catherine and Uma are witness to a mysterious light, which they both interpret according to their own faiths, thus dividing a community already beleaguered by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. </p> <p>\"The inspiration for the project was hearing they'd built an airport at Knock [in Ireland, where a vision was observed in 1879] because it had attracted so many tourists,\" he recalls. \"I went right back to Medrugoria, Lourdes, Garabandal, those visionary sites. The visions all happened to young children in rural communities in times of civil strife or famine. That's what really interested me; the way that these visions happened when they needed to happen. </p> <p>\"Knowing what I know about what's going on in the countryside with the farming community, those two ideas really clicked with me. At a time when Welsh farmers are putting newly-born calves in telephone boxes and farmers are going bankrupt, this is a community that needs a sense of hope, if ever there was one.\" </p> <p>Despite being a self- confessed \"woolly agnostic\", Beaufoy admits to being fascinated by both the divisive power of faith, and what he perceives as a growing trend towards spiritual questioning in 21st-century society. \"We've tried everything in the last century to make us happy; communism, capitalism, Armani jeans, crystals, crop circles, you name it. People no longer believe in established government, established churches, established anything. We'll realise soon that shopping will bring no happiness. Getting Charlie Dimmock to do our garden will not actually provide any long-lasting sense of fulfilment.\" </p> <p>The Darkest Light is hardly another Full Monty: Beaufoy is aware that a film which balances alternative perspectives and ends ambivalently, rather than hammering home a message right up to the finish line, is unlikely to be a huge commercial or international success. It's a film, not a movie. </p> <p>A more easily digestible slice of entertainment is in the pipeline, however: his hairdressing comedy Never Better, the aforementioned script bought unseen by Miramax in the wake of The Full Monty's success. Beaufoy has effectively disowned the project, and regrets the fact that his precious authenticity is about to be snipped into a Hollywood treatment. It is again set in Yorkshire, even closer to home than his previous scripts, but the lead roles will be played by American teen stars Josh Hartnett (of The Faculty) and Rachael Leigh Cook (who starred in last year's She's All That). </p> <p>\"It's become more like New Yorkshire,\" he smirks. \"American stars with flat caps going, 'Eh oop.' But it's about hairdressing in the same way The Full Monty was about stripping. So instead of writing about competition hairdressing I wrote about lesbianism, cancer and divorce.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Donald Cammell's death, in April 1996, was hardly world news. He had directed only three and a half feature films in four decades. Performance, his best known, was co-directed with Nicolas Roeg, who went on to fame and fortune, while Cammell fell into obscurity. End of story. </p> <p>Except it wasn't. His last film, Wild Side, starred then-unknown actress Anne Heche as a lesbian call girl. Cammell liked to jump around between disparate characters and dislocated scenes. The production company who hired him, Nu Image, didn't. It butchered Wild Side, which went straight to cable in the US and was never seen in the UK. Heche came out and became a star; Cammell put a pistol to his head and pulled the trigger; his editor, Frank Mazzola, who taught James Dean to knife-fight, reached for his knife once more and returned to Wild Side. It was time for justice. </p> <p>Cammell's work has undergone a significant critical re-evaluation since his death. As early as 1995 Performance appeared at number 28 in an \"all-time greats\" poll of critics and directors. In 1998 it was the subject of a BFI Film Classics book and the BBC screened a documentary on Cammell. \"It's not unexpected,\" says his widow, China Kong. \"Donald always said his work would be appreciated far more after his death.\" Mazzola spent much of last year using his skills with a knife, re-editing Wild Side to produce a posthumous director's cut. He finished just in time for a world premiere at the Edinburgh film festival in August, and the new version will be released in British cinemas later this year, before screening on Channel 4. </p> <p>The Edinburgh audience were hugely appreciative, but few had had the chance to see the original Nu Image version and appreciate the extent of Mazzola's rescue operation. I cannot think of two such radically different films being produced from the same raw footage - a point underlined by the fact that Mazzola's version is 20 minutes longer, though it contains fewer scenes. Nu Image's film is an intriguing mess, a flawed minor movie, whereas the new version is an effective companion piece to Performance. </p> <p>Heche plays a banker who works as a call girl on the side, in which capacity she meets Christopher Walken, who is also involved in the world of finance - \"the Leonardo da Vinci of dirty money\". Joan Chen, his ex-wife and business partner, opens an account at Heche's bank and before long Heche and Chen are lovers as well. Nu Image's Wild Side is the sort of trashy sex thriller that turns up late at night on Channel 5. Some of the acting - particularly Heche's - is downright bad, as if the cast were just warming up or trying things out. Which is exactly what they were doing. But viewers who saw only this version had no way of knowing there were better takes - and indeed a whole different film - lying on the cutting-room floor. </p> <p>Mazzola and Cammell met 30 years ago in Hollywood, Mazzola's hometown. His father was one of the Keystone Cops and Mazzola played Crunch in Rebel Without a Cause. The film's knife-fight came from his own experiences. \"I used to fight a lot when I was a kid,\" he says in a lethargic, sun-baked Californian drawl. \"This guy pulled a knife on me... I was a boxer and I pulled a leather jacket over my hand, so it wouldn't get cut, and I started feinting the guy and then I hooked him a beautiful shot and just basically beat the crap out of the guy... When I told Nick (director Nicholas Ray) and Jimmy about that, they said 'Would you like to stage the knife fight and do it just the way you told us?' \"</p> <p>Cammell came from a very different world. He was born in the Outlook Tower, next to Edinburgh castle, in 1934, the son of Charles Cammell, a poet who inherited and lost the Cammell Laird shipbuilding fortune. Occultist Aleister Crowley was a family friend, but contrary to popular belief was not Donald's godfather. Donald's brother David, one of the producers of Performance, told me Donald embroidered the truth to impress people. From the outset Cammell's story is one in which romance, rumour and legend interweave. He became a successful artist, moving in exciting circles and doing as much as anyone to make the 60s swing.

Cinematographer Nicolas Roeg was another friend, who came on board to lend a little technical know-how. Performance was in the can by the time Cammell met Mazzola, but Cammell was having trouble in post-production. Mazzola, who had given up acting to become a film editor, saw it and felt inspired. \"I said I have got to work on this film... There was so much magic going on between us, there was so much electricity, I was cutting stuff so fast, it was unbelievable. I would do like three cuts at a time... There was something beautiful about it.\" </p> <p>Not everyone agreed. Jagger plays a reclusive rock star, Anita Pallenberg and Mich\u00e8le Breton his girlfriends and James Fox an east end gangster who turns up on their doorstep. During the perverse power and sex games that follow, the identities of the two male characters begin to merge. It seems the first inkling Warner got that they were not going to get a Rolling Stones version of A Hard Day's Night was when executives attended a preview screening and watched an opening sequence that cut back and forth between a Rolls-Royce in the countryside and a scene of violent sex.</p> <p>They wanted to destroy the film and sue the makers, but relented after the success of the hippy classic Easy Rider, and Performance developed a cult following. Nevertheless Cammell found it difficult to get backing for other projects and hired himself out as a jobbing director on the sci-fi film Demon Seed, also edited by Mazzola. They made their mark with surreal visuals, despite rows with MGM. </p> <p>Cammell's only other feature before Wild Side was White of the Eye, in which a woman discovers her husband is a serial killer. He co-wrote it with China Kong, whom he met when she was still at school. After White of the Eye, Cammell turned down numerous directing opportunities, including Pretty Woman. </p> <p>Cammell and Kong collaborated on numerous scripts and it was Kong who came up with the story for Wild Side in 1994. Unusually, Cammell had little difficulty finding finance - it from Nu Image, a company that specialises in exploitation films, often involving cops or vicious animals. But there were problems. \"They didn't want Anne,\" says Kong. \"They wanted somebody else, another type of actress.\" There were further clashes with producer Elie Cohn and, according to Kong, Cammell threw him off the set. </p> <p>But it was when studio executives sat down to watch the rough cut that it became apparent - in a scene that echoed the Performance screening - just how wide apart Cammell and Nu Image's expectations were. \"We were looking at dailies and laughing at a lot of the stuff,\" says Mazzola. \"When I started cutting, it all held together, so I would play things long... At the running I never heard any laughter. They never saw any humour in the film. \"At the end of our rough cut Elie Cohn got up, said 'It's slow,' and walked out.\"</p> <p>Cammell received written demands for 30 minutes of cuts, clarification of the storyline, the removal of all the flashbacks and specific amendments to numerous scenes. Before long Cammell and Mazzola were off the movie. Nu Image brought in another editor and Wild Side was televised and subsequently released on video under the directorial credit Franklin Brauner, a relation of Alan Smithee.</p> <p>Mazzola wanted to protest in the trade press, but Cammell asked him to hold fire because Hamish McAlpine, head of Metro Tartan distributors in London, was involved in discussions with Nu Image over UK rights and Cammell was confident he would \"get the film back\". Prospects were looking brighter in other areas too: Cammell and Kong were back together after a separation and McAlpine was producing another Cammell film, Thirty Three, a thriller set in Istanbul in the 30s. The script was sent to Bill Pullman, star of Independence Day. He committed to it, and the next day Cammell shot himself. </p> <p>\"I knew things were going to happen the way they happened for a very long time, some 20 years,\" says Kong, though she still finds it almost impossible to talk about her husband's death. McAlpine believes it was because he was so happy that Cammell decided, like the old Indian chief in Little Big Man, that it was a good day to die. So it was without Cammell that Mazzola returned to the editing room in Hollywood in which he assembled Performance 30 years earlier and picked up on Wild Side where he and Cammell left off. \"We knew there were certain scenes that were problems, there were certain sequences weren't quite working properly,\" he says. \"Several weeks before he died we discussed everything that we wanted to do with the film and he assured me that we would have our cut.\" </p> <p>Nu Image's pre-credit sequence begins with a shot of what looks like an Airfix aeroplane, before cutting to a man making a ham-fisted pass at Heche, suggesting they go to his place in the Bahamas to \"get it on\". She writhes and grunts, and then bites his ear, at the same time telling him to fuck off. Finally she slaps him, simultaneously on both cheeks the way Eric Morecambe used to do. It plays like Confessions of an Air Stewardess. </p> <p>In its opening sequence, the new version rapidly cuts between scenes, in typical Cammell fashion. But subsequently Mazzola lingers much longer over individual scenes. He replaces poorly-acted takes and eliminates awkward sequences and risible lines that Cammell was just trying out. But the biggest difference is the way in which Mazzola allows characters, scenes and humour to develop at their own pace, with extra dialogue and reaction shots.

      "bodyText": "Donald Cammell's death, in April 1996, was hardly world news. He had directed only three and a half feature films in four decades. Performance, his best known, was co-directed with Nicolas Roeg, who went on to fame and fortune, while Cammell fell into obscurity. End of story. Except it wasn't. His last film, Wild Side, starred then-unknown actress Anne Heche as a lesbian call girl. Cammell liked to jump around between disparate characters and dislocated scenes. The production company who hired him, Nu Image, didn't. It butchered Wild Side, which went straight to cable in the US and was never seen in the UK. Heche came out and became a star; Cammell put a pistol to his head and pulled the trigger; his editor, Frank Mazzola, who taught James Dean to knife-fight, reached for his knife once more and returned to Wild Side. It was time for justice. Cammell's work has undergone a significant critical re-evaluation since his death. As early as 1995 Performance appeared at number 28 in an \"all-time greats\" poll of critics and directors. In 1998 it was the subject of a BFI Film Classics book and the BBC screened a documentary on Cammell. \"It's not unexpected,\" says his widow, China Kong. \"Donald always said his work would be appreciated far more after his death.\" Mazzola spent much of last year using his skills with a knife, re-editing Wild Side to produce a posthumous director's cut. He finished just in time for a world premiere at the Edinburgh film festival in August, and the new version will be released in British cinemas later this year, before screening on Channel 4. The Edinburgh audience were hugely appreciative, but few had had the chance to see the original Nu Image version and appreciate the extent of Mazzola's rescue operation. I cannot think of two such radically different films being produced from the same raw footage - a point underlined by the fact that Mazzola's version is 20 minutes longer, though it contains fewer scenes. Nu Image's film is an intriguing mess, a flawed minor movie, whereas the new version is an effective companion piece to Performance. Heche plays a banker who works as a call girl on the side, in which capacity she meets Christopher Walken, who is also involved in the world of finance - \"the Leonardo da Vinci of dirty money\". Joan Chen, his ex-wife and business partner, opens an account at Heche's bank and before long Heche and Chen are lovers as well. Nu Image's Wild Side is the sort of trashy sex thriller that turns up late at night on Channel 5. Some of the acting - particularly Heche's - is downright bad, as if the cast were just warming up or trying things out. Which is exactly what they were doing. But viewers who saw only this version had no way of knowing there were better takes - and indeed a whole different film - lying on the cutting-room floor. Mazzola and Cammell met 30 years ago in Hollywood, Mazzola's hometown. His father was one of the Keystone Cops and Mazzola played Crunch in Rebel Without a Cause. The film's knife-fight came from his own experiences. \"I used to fight a lot when I was a kid,\" he says in a lethargic, sun-baked Californian drawl. \"This guy pulled a knife on me... I was a boxer and I pulled a leather jacket over my hand, so it wouldn't get cut, and I started feinting the guy and then I hooked him a beautiful shot and just basically beat the crap out of the guy... When I told Nick (director Nicholas Ray) and Jimmy about that, they said 'Would you like to stage the knife fight and do it just the way you told us?' \" Cammell came from a very different world. He was born in the Outlook Tower, next to Edinburgh castle, in 1934, the son of Charles Cammell, a poet who inherited and lost the Cammell Laird shipbuilding fortune. Occultist Aleister Crowley was a family friend, but contrary to popular belief was not Donald's godfather. Donald's brother David, one of the producers of Performance, told me Donald embroidered the truth to impress people. From the outset Cammell's story is one in which romance, rumour and legend interweave. He became a successful artist, moving in exciting circles and doing as much as anyone to make the 60s swing. He had an idea for a film called The Performers in which his friend Mick Jagger would play a rock star. United Artists had made a fortune on the Beatles films and Warner Brothers leapt at the chance to cash in on their biggest rivals.

Frank himself survives typhoid and conjunctivitis that almost blinds him.</p> <p>Death becomes banal; the two boys, Frank and Malachy, numbly accept the marble-faced corpses of their dead siblings in the house while they wait for the undertaker, and dirty stories and conversation carry on regardless. Only when Malachy senior actually has his pint on the tiny coffin wedged in front of him in WJ South's pub, is some complaint raised.</p> <p>It scarcely seems possible that comedy could arise from all this: but it does, partly hysterical death-of-Little-Nell laughs, but real, feel-good laughs too - and it is a testament to Parker's control over the material that he can bring in this comic mode with such dexterity.</p> <p>Largely it is to be found in the language of ordinary Limerick life.

Safeway said like-for-like sales in the 12 weeks to January 8 were ahead 6.1% and the shares climbed 5.5p to 217.25p. But there were black spots. Body Shop said its UK sales down 3%. But gains in the US left overall sales flat. Storehouse reported like-for-like Bhs sales down 4.4%, compared to the 9.2% decline reported in the first half of the financial year. Mothercare was down just 0.2%. Storehouse said the figures showed some progress but analysts have decided the company is near basket-case status and see a bid as the only escape for shareholders. But analyst Rowan Morgan at stockbroker Teather &amp; Greenwood said the company had \"no earnings, no dividend, no management, no pricing power, no credibility and no bidder in the wings\".",

Ms Large appealed to the Charity Commission which held an investigation and there was also an internal inquiry, chaired by Richard Southwell QC. A new board of directors yesterday decided to implement the Southwell recommendations in full and to reinstate Ms Large as the most senior executive on the trust. \"We are not planning to become a high-technology business park but a heartland for the communications and technology industries,\" she said. Ms Large wants to develop Bletchley, not only as a heritage site telling the story of its wartime triumph and subsequent communications innovation, but also to establish a community education base, to encourage conferences in the mathematics, high technology and communications sectors and to encourage a revival of research and development. Sir Philip Duncombe, who remains chairman of the board, said Bletchley Park would have \"the benefit of valuable skills and much experience to equip it for the 21st century.\" Ms Large insisted that anything which the organisation now tried would have to be commercially viable and said the board had already indicated its determination to become more professional by appointing Chris Smith as managing director and Tim Pulverman as operations and finance director. Other board additions are banker Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and Roy MacLaren, the Canadian High Commissioner.",

      "bodyText": "Easdaq, the pan-European stock exchange, is to steal a march on New York's Nasdaq index by allowing traders to buy and sell shares in 10 of its American rival's best-known companies before the US market opens. Investors will be able to buy and sell shares in companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon.com six hours before the New York market even opens for business from next week. The move was also seen as a blow to the London stock exchange, which is keen to attract high-technology stocks to its Techmark index. Easdaq, which is based in Brussels, announced yesterday that it had gained regulatory approval for the 10 technology companies listed on Nasdaq index to be traded on its own exchange. Nasdaq, a benchmark for technology companies in the United States and one of the world's largest stock markets, has already announced plans to launch its own European exchange later this year. Nasdaq Europe, seen as a bid to move towards all-day trading, will not be operational for several months. \"We intend to include several more companies before Nasdaq comes in towards the end of this year,\" said Lauren Ptito at Easdaq yesterday. Easdaq intends to allow investors to trade in a further 30 companies in the coming months. These companies, which will come from Israel as well as the US, will remain listed on their domestic exchanges. Share trading in Europe has become intensely competitive as several exchanges fight for the increased interest from ordinary investors as well as big institutions. Existing exchanges face increased competition from the fast-growing electronic communications networks as well as each other. Yesterday's announcement is part of Easdaq's push to expand its role beyond trading in initial public offerings and secondary offerings of the 56 companies listed on its exchange. The exchange announced its plans to make markets in non-listed companies last year in a bid to raise its profile in the face of fierce competition. Microsoft, valued at $526bn (\u00a3320bn), dwarfs NTL, the largest company currently traded on Easdaq which is valued at 12bn euros (\u00a37.5bn). The new Easdaq-listed companies also include Cisco Systems, Intel, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, MCI Worldcom, Amgen and Dell.",

As the person responsible for overseeing the industry's private monopoly, Mr Winsor has become increasingly irked by interference from Sir Alastair. He wrote a strongly worded reply which his office would not reveal yesterday. Keith Webb, the regulator's director of strategy and planning, said: \"It would be remarkable if there was not an occasional piece of creative tension between the main players in the industry. This is part of having an independent regulator.\" Differences between the two are likely to be underlined in the coming months when the new SRA is finally set up under the government's new transport legislation. Some of Mr Winsor's powers will be handed over to the SRA, although Mr Winsor will press ahead with his plan to make Railtrack more accountable to the public interest. Mr Prescott is anxious that the row should be stopped without doing further damage because it has become a talking point in the industry. The SRA stressed that the two men had not quarrelled, although there had been a difference of opinion.",

Not because the deputy governor of the Bank of England takes a sadistic delight in seeing the cost of mortgages and overdrafts rise but because he has long held that monetary policy should be as boring and predictable as possible. Yesterday's move was as boring and predictable as they come. So, for that matter, was the reaction to the decision, which was condemned by the usual suspects for putting the economy on the road to ruin. </p> <p>But even a moment's reflection would indicate that the Bank had little choice. It was right to put up rates and it was right to put them up modestly. Of course, there is an argument for leaving borrowing costs at 5.5% and there is an argument for banging them up by half a point, but neither is specially convincing. Britain's multi-speed economy, with strong regional differences and disparities between the performance of manufacturing and services requires sensitive handling but there is no doubt that the recent evidence has pointed to inflationary pressure building up. </p> <p>To take one example: the Halifax yesterday reported that house prices rose by 3.4% in the final quarter of 1999 and by 11.5% for the year as a whole. In Greater London, however, they were up by a stonking 28.9% last year, a faster rate of increase than in 1988, the height of the Lawson boom. The south-east has its own peculiar economic characteristics but house prices generally are being underpinned by the tightness of the labour market, where recent months have seen average earnings rise by 4.9%. </p> <p>As Michael Saunders of Salomon Smith Barney Citibank put it yesterday, real interest rates are running at around 3.75%, in line with the average of the past five years. But this five-year period has seen domestic demand running well above the economy's long-term potential, despite considerable fiscal tightening. As such, real interest rates of 3.75%, although high by global standards, might not be enough to keep the lid on demand. Put another way, says Mr Saunders, Britain is different. \"If both the UK and Germany have nominal short rates of 5.5% and the same inflation rate (say, about 2%), then German households probably would buy bonds whereas UK households would go to the nearest estate agent, borrow lots of money, buy houses and set a house price boom in motion.\" </p> <p>So, if the housing market is flashing red and the labour market is flashing amber, why not even more Draconian action? If young internet entrepreneurs are becoming stock market millionaires overnight and spending their riches on palaces and Porsches, shouldn't the MPC stop pussy-footing around with quarter-point increases? Well, no. </p> <p>The other side of the new economy was revealed when Dixons said this week that its profits are being hit by tumbling prices. Dixons is by no means a one-off. The clothing manufacturer Dewhirst announced yesterday that the squeeze on profits was to blame for the loss of 1000 jobs at two plants in the north, in County Durham and Cheshire. Global overcapacity, an unfavourable exchange rate and ingrained customer resistance to paying higher prices mean that the corporate sector is already being squeezed and could be hit hard by an over-aggressive monetary policy. So, too, could consumers, despite the low level of unemployment. </p> <p>Geoff Dicks of Greenwich NatWest points out that the personal savings ratio is already at a 10-year-low and might start to rise over the coming months as interest rates edge upward and mortgage interest relief is phased out. Whatever happens, consumers are likely to be as eager to spot a bargain as they have been for most of the past 10 years, providing no respite for retailers. </p> <p>The money markets are in no mood for any of this, and have convinced themselves that rates are inexorably heading for 7.5% or even higher. But longer-term money market rates are normally wrong, and it may be that the two or three quarter-point rises the MPC has in store for us in the first half of this year will be enough.</p>",

The cavernous performing spaces there have attracted the attention of the fledgling Clarion Music Theatre, whose inaugural show revives an early music-theatre piece by Harrison Birtwistle and Michael Nyman (who in an earlier incarnation was responsible for the text). </p> <p>Down by the Greenwood Side, premiered in 1969, has not been staged in London in many years. It lasts a little over half an hour, requires four actors, a soprano, a mime and an instrumental ensemble, and was one of the products of that late 60s explosion of music-theatre in Britain, led by Peter Maxwell Davies, Alexander Goehr and Birtwistle, which offered young composers a real theatrical alternative to writing full-blown operas at a time when opera houses in this country seemed only interested in looking backwards. Sparely scored and dramatically taut, this \"dramatic pastoral\" is very much a piece of its time, yet explores the perennial Birtwistle preoccupation with myths and the cyclic processes with which he draws them out. </p> <p>Nyman's text, with its deceptively jokey surface full of surreal imagery and wordplay, interweaves two traditional English sources, a Mummers' play about St George and his battle with the Black Knight (aka Bold Slasher), and the Ballad of the Cruell Mother. The play is acted out to instrumental accompaniment, the ballad sung by the soprano as a series of refrains. The music (scored for the line-up listed in the Cornish Floral Dance) is alternately savage and rhapsodic, yet binds these two elements perfectly. </p> <p>Musically the Clarion performance, with Lore Lixenberg excellent as the singer and an ensemble expertly conducted by Tim Murray, catches the flavour of the piece. But the staging, directed by Sarah V Chew, is by turns irritating and prosaic. Like much of Birtwistle's theatre Down by the Greenwood Side is intensely stylised, and it's not just my antipathy for audience participation that makes Chew's attempt to turn it into some adult pantomime seem misjudged - by breaking down the barrier between the audience and the performance and using naturalistic rather than puppet-like costumes, the ritual element of the piece is destroyed. Chances to see this curious work are rare, though if you go, take your thermals. </p> <p>Continues tonight, tomorrow and Sunday. Box office: 0171-602 5707</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new opera venue and a new opera company. Three Mills Studios is a complex of East End industrial buildings alongside the River Lea, used now by the film industry. The cavernous performing spaces there have attracted the attention of the fledgling Clarion Music Theatre, whose inaugural show revives an early music-theatre piece by Harrison Birtwistle and Michael Nyman (who in an earlier incarnation was responsible for the text). Down by the Greenwood Side, premiered in 1969, has not been staged in London in many years. It lasts a little over half an hour, requires four actors, a soprano, a mime and an instrumental ensemble, and was one of the products of that late 60s explosion of music-theatre in Britain, led by Peter Maxwell Davies, Alexander Goehr and Birtwistle, which offered young composers a real theatrical alternative to writing full-blown operas at a time when opera houses in this country seemed only interested in looking backwards. Sparely scored and dramatically taut, this \"dramatic pastoral\" is very much a piece of its time, yet explores the perennial Birtwistle preoccupation with myths and the cyclic processes with which he draws them out. Nyman's text, with its deceptively jokey surface full of surreal imagery and wordplay, interweaves two traditional English sources, a Mummers' play about St George and his battle with the Black Knight (aka Bold Slasher), and the Ballad of the Cruell Mother. The play is acted out to instrumental accompaniment, the ballad sung by the soprano as a series of refrains. The music (scored for the line-up listed in the Cornish Floral Dance) is alternately savage and rhapsodic, yet binds these two elements perfectly. Musically the Clarion performance, with Lore Lixenberg excellent as the singer and an ensemble expertly conducted by Tim Murray, catches the flavour of the piece. But the staging, directed by Sarah V Chew, is by turns irritating and prosaic. Like much of Birtwistle's theatre Down by the Greenwood Side is intensely stylised, and it's not just my antipathy for audience participation that makes Chew's attempt to turn it into some adult pantomime seem misjudged - by breaking down the barrier between the audience and the performance and using naturalistic rather than puppet-like costumes, the ritual element of the piece is destroyed. Chances to see this curious work are rare, though if you go, take your thermals. Continues tonight, tomorrow and Sunday. Box office: 0171-602 5707",

Nearly all think that their working habits damage their spouse, their children and their own health. What's more, most think these working practices damage their company's productivity. These are the people who set the work patterns for their organisation, yet even they feel they are victims of forces beyond their control - such as pressure from investors and competitors. What can be done? </p> <p>\"This is an issue whose time has come\" pronounced employment minister Margaret Hodge with emphatic determination this week, launching a government sponsored Work-Life Manual. It exhorts employers to give workers a better balance between home and working lives. What chance? Publication of this manual is a prelude to a major event when the prime minister will launch a \"business-led alliance\" of pioneering companies pledging themselves to more humane working. It has been much delayed and kept under wraps, because this issue cuts right down the ambivalent fault line at the heart of New Labour. Tony Blair, new man, arch-promulgator of family and community life, is also the one who forged New Labour's identity by stamping down trade unions and siding loudly with business at every opportunity. His government's hymns of praise to work - a broom or spade in every hand - have drowned out the family-friendly stuff. </p> <p>When he launches this project his speech writers will have problems. What can he say with conviction after his record so far on Britain's over-work culture? The parental leave directive was brought in reluctantly and then deliberately emasculated to have minimal effect. Introduced years ago across Europe, most other countries offer paid leave but Labour made ours unpaid, so very few are expected to be able to use it. Just as bad was the heel-dragging over the 48-hour working time directive. Britain alone used an opt-out allowing employees to \"volunteer\" to work longer than 48 hours. As a result Citizens Advice Bureaus are deep in cases where people have been forced to \"volunteer\" to work longer. (4 m people now work over 48 hours.)

The other half is with the macho DTI where Stephen Byers wants nothing to do with this stuff. The DTI works for employers (presumed male) where real men work all hours and fight their way to the top on the shoulders of wimps who go home on time. Now Tony Blair is going to have to make up his mind. Which is it to be? No doubt he will be quite happy with an entirely voluntary exhortation to employers to create better working conditions. But will anything change unless the government takes a firm lead and makes it happen? </p> <p>Rebranding \"family-friendly\" working as \"work-life\" is a smart move, proclaiming this is no longer a special favour for mothers, but for everyone because everyone needs a life. As yet only 5% of employers meet the work-life balance recommendations in this manual, though it brims with good examples of win-win deals where large and small firms have found variable ways of working that suit both, freeing some to work partly at home, wasting less time commuting. It requires managers to abandon meaningless meetings and concentrate on output, not hours worked. In Bristol an angry, demoralised library service where workers were shunted about each week at the whim of managers now has a new schedule where people negotiate their own hours.

The trombone-playing husband she discarded comes home to die. Her son, David, runs off to join a jazz band rather than become a pentecostal piano-player.

He conveys with particular vividness the vicious backbiting of these hot-gospellers. Even Sister Margaret's one-time sexual vigour is held against her. As someone cattily remarks, \"no wonder that woman make so much noise when she up in the pulpit.\" Baldwin also captures the boy David's urgent need to escape. But audiences are much quicker now than they were in the 50s, and you feel the spiritual awakening of Sister Margaret, a beskirted version of Ibsen's Brand, is too long coming. The play's destination is easily visible but Baldwin takes the scenic route. </p> <p>The show itself, like the 1987 Tricycle version which moved into the West End, is directed by Anton Phillips, who captures well its mix of spiritual vehemence and vestry politics. Pat Bowie as Sister Margaret neatly suggests the strong sexual nostalgia lurking under the matriarchal discipline. Alibe Parsons is outstanding as the prune-faced, ostentatiously virginal Sister Moore plotting to take over her pulpit. And Ray Shell is lightly venomous as a bible-puncher seething at his pastor's refusal to let him drive a liquor truck.
