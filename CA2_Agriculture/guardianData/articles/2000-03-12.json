      "body": "<p>Key 'London mayor' into your internet search engine and you discover that two car salesman are running for the capital's new office. One is Steven Norris, who made his first million selling Volkswagens in Wiltshire and bought a pea-green Rolls Royce to celebrate. The other is Frank Butcher of Albert Square, diamond geezer and unlovable rogue. The 'Frankly, we'd rather have Frank' site was set up in response to the fact that there is no real independent mayoral alternative to the established party candidates.</p> <p>'Frank', as Frank's 'frank-talking' supporters would have it, 'is not a politician, he's one of us.' The Norris site wants us to believe something similar. Their man, though he now has the somewhat grudging backing of his party, is not concerned with ideology, he's just impatient to get things done. 'Action not politics', his slogan says.</p> <p>The rivals have a few other things in common: both men have a bit of romantic hinterland; both wear their hearts on the sleeve of a flash suit; neither is afraid to call a spade a spade, or get his hands dirty (or employ a populist clich\u00e9 ). And both are, you suspect, essentially fictional characters.</p> <p>The Tories' unembarrassable first reserve has long been at pains to present himself as a maverick. He's the champion of civil liberties who firmly believes in capital punishment; he was instrumental in the great railway sell-off, yet sympathised with the road protesters at Newbury; he's a campaigner for freedom of information and a subject of tabloid intrusions; he's a Conservative anti-hunt protester who cries at Broadway tunes.</p> <p>'But hell,' he says, ever the bloke's bloke, 'I've never been afraid of being the only fella in the regiment marching out of step...'</p> <p>Steven Norris likes to admit he may irritate some people but he is equally fond of suggesting those same people could trust him to get the trains running on time, make things happen. 'Y'know, ruffle some feathers, if that's what it takes...'</p> <p>The first thing he has to make happen when I arrive to meet him is solving the problem of how to get into his campaign office in Victoria. 'We're locked out,' his PR man explains, and sends me over the road for breakfast. Eventually the key to the Norris nerve centre is located, the public transport guru's full-time chauffeur comes to find me, and I'm ushered inside where a jolly (but fundamentally serious) Norris leads me through a corridor decked with his jolly (but fundamentally serious) posters. There is then a little debate as to who will get coffee; several orders for our three cups are placed with different campaign staff; two coffees eventually arrive.</p> <p>By which time Norris is doing what you imagine is his second-favourite thing: talking about transport. 'I'm standing for mayor because I'm an appalling anorak who happens to know more about London's bus and Tube network than almost anyone else alive,' he says, and over the course of the next hour goes out of his way to prove the fact, explaining how he is patron of Susstrans bike initiative and of the 'ultra-green' Transport 2000 group (this in addition to his lucrative non-executive chairmanship of one of London's bus operators, and former directorship of the Road Haulage Association).</p> <p>There is something mesmerising in listening to Norris talk about the city's traffic. He gets an evangelical glint in his eye. His voice goes up half an octave. He's the Billy Graham of bus lanes; the Jimmy Swaggart of the Central Line. It feels like we've been round the North Circular a couple of times before I get to ask a question.</p> <p>And when Norris is not talking about his own transport policies he's rubbishing those of Ken Livingstone. Though Norris is, according to the latest poll, lying a distant third in the campaign with 11 per cent of the projected vote, he is making every attempt to convince anyone who'll listen that 'of course it's essentially a two-horse race'. He dismisses Frank Dobson loftily as a party placeman and he does not deign even to mention Susan Kramer, who he bullied and patronised on last week's Question Time. In his wilfully narrowed view it's either himself or Ken. 'When we heard Livingstone was in,' he says in his bullish way, 'this place really got a buzz - at last you know who your enemy is, what the battle is.</p> <p>'Our job is a simple one,' he goes on, never a man to get mired in petty politicking. 'The dinner party conversation may be that voting for Ken is a good way to poke Blair in the eye with a stick; but in fact, of course, the best way to poke him in the eye with a stick is to vote for me.'</p> <p>Norris is keen to characterise himself in this sense as the London equivalent of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the unashamed pragmatist in a city of political correctness: 'I make that comparison unhesitatingly,' he says. 'The reality is that Giuliani is a Republican in a city of Democrats. New Yorkers don't like him much but they respect him. I don't see why you need to be disliked as such, but people always respect someone who can deliver.'</p> <p>There are those in Norris's own party who might be just as likely to draw a comparison between Norris and another celebrated American mayor. Not since Marion Barry was re-elected in Washington DC in 1994 after having been filmed in room 727 of the Vista International Hotel trying to persuade a former glamour model into his bed while taking drags on a pipe full of crack cocaine can a mayoral candidate have enjoyed such a special relationship with tabloid newspapers. Though Norris now talks of the week in 1993 when every day produced another unlikely front page Norris lover 'as a long, long, long time ago', it has come back to haunt him in this campaign.</p> <p>Initially his candidature was blocked when a small group of his former constituency members in Epping Forest sent a letter to the London selection committee. The letter raked over Norris's infidelities and suggested him unfit for public office. There was an extra edge to it in that one of its signatories was the mother of Tim Collins, now William Hague's press secretary and in 1993 the 'brains' behind John Major's doomed 'Back to Basics' campaign, which Norris did so much to promote. Norris, 'for once allowing myself to be ungenerous', dismissed those responsible for the letter as a 'monstrous regiment' of 'harpies'. Meanwhile, the day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses - Lucy Clayton graduate Emma Courtney, the mother of Norris's third son - since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.</p> <p>Norris's reaction to these stories has always been to build them into his personal mythology. 'He makes a great virtue of his amorality,' says Sheila Gunn, the political journalist. And she should know: she was in the odd position of being the mistress who discovered she was being cheated on by Norris when she read Nigel Dempster's column. Certainly the 'Rolex Romeo' is fond of a lowest common denominator defence: I may be a serial adulterer, he has always suggested, but, hey, aren't we all (and anyway who else is going to get the trains running on time, ruffle a few feathers etc). Parliamentary insiders say he rather enjoys his tea room soubriquet 'shagger'. I wonder if he thinks his very public private life is something that enhances his appeal?</p> <p>He looks a little pained, shakes his head. 'Oh, no, no, no, Tim,' he says, suddenly grave. 'Not proud of it, no. That's not me at all...'</p> <p>The thing that saved Norris's political life back in 1993 was the fact that, unlike some of his colleagues in the Major administration, he had never preached on lifestyle choices. He continues to annoy the right of his party and Telegraph leader writers by supporting the abolition of Clause 28, and suggesting the Metropolitan Police should have more important concerns than rounding up gay men cruising in the dead of night on Hampstead Heath. (Norris is fond of responding to the question 'what will you do for the gay lobby?' with the reply 'gays use the Tube, too.')</p> <p>Unsurprisingly for a man with his track record, Norris does not see any link between public and private morality. 'I will run my campaign on the basis of Who I Am,' he says. 'And I won't fit into any identikit pictures if they clearly don't fit.'</p> <p>Who Norris is, however, is almost anyone's guess: reading his autobiography Changing Trains , you have the sense of a man who has come to believe his own myths; talking to him, you feel he finds it hard to separate the stories from the reality (he describes his days running a car dealership in Salisbury, for example, as his 'Guys-and-Dolls-Damon-Runyon kind of life').</p> <p>The son of a civil servant father and a teacher mother, he grew up in Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney (who used to play skiffle in free periods) and George Harrison. He says he still sees himself as a scouser and is as quick as ever to suggest how that makes him attractive: 'I have the huge advantage now of sounding and looking reasonably classless; I'm comfortable - after a good grammar school and Oxford - at any intellectual level, and at the same time I have the advantage of knowing that if I ended up back in a two-up-two-down in Liverpool I'd be fine. He smiles, and then corrects himself. 'Actually my mum will be on the phone: we also had a box bedroom in the front.'</p> <p>Though the closest he apparently got to free love back then was a famous fumble with Edwina Currie behind the school bike sheds, does he see himself a child of the Sixties? He winces a little. 'I wouldn't go that far,' he says of his party's least favourite decade.</p> <p>He believes his life is 'absolutely settled now with Emma'. She describes their relationship as 'extremely tactile' and displays a great capacity for trust. 'When someone says \"I want your child\", you tend to believe them,' she says of Norris.</p> <p>Now 54, her jowly partner is enjoying his life as a new dad and suggests he has got his bed-hopping out of his system. Still, the closest he gets to introspection is to say that he 'internalises things too much, buries things too deeply, although I often cry in the car, which helps'.</p> <p>Apart from a blocked nearside bus lane, what exactly opens the floodgates? 'Oh probably just a Cole Porter song or something,' he says. 'I am simply a hopeless sentimentalist and that might even mask a less attractive side of my character. Emma would say that I have an ability to cut myself off that is quite terrifying on occasions. It's the way some people respond to a challenge or to danger or whatever.</p> <p>'I wouldn't say I was particularly brave physically - not,' he hastens to add, 'that I've ever had any problems in that line. I think we're all... you know ... I'm trying to find a thread. I'm a sentimentalist who might therefore not actually be prone to great swings of emotional depth.'</p> <p>That superficiality is perhaps what allows Steven Norris to come across as having such an uncomplicated agenda. He has no problem, for example, in believing that though he walked from his job at the Ministry of Transport into extremely well-paid directorships with transport companies no one 'has ever once hired me for my contacts book'. Similarly he does not labour under the slightest Prescott-style guilt-trip when he discusses the problems of the 77a while his chauffeur idles outside.</p> <p>But it is presumably this same relaxed conscience that prompted Sheila Gunn to say 'she fell in love with a man who didn't exist'. Norris's other one time amour, Edwina Currie, remarked in reviewing Changing Trains that Norris and his ilk, who grew up politically in the Thatcher years, 'just didn't get it': didn't understand that 'integrity and probity are not partial qualities... but must shine though every facet.'</p> <p>Norris, typically, would rather let himself off more lightly. He once remarked that his epitaph would read 'Here lies Steven Norris. This is the first place he has taken seriously.' He has long proved the virtue of being able to laugh at himself; the difficulty he faces now, you sense, is persuading Londoners they don't have to share the joke.</p>",

Shane Warne and Brett Lee both took wickets with their second balls to reduce New Zealand's reply from 25 for one to 26 for four in the space of four overs. </p> <p>After Glenn McGrath, unerringly straight and fast, broke through with Matt Horne's dismissal, Warne's leg-spin removed No 3 Mathew Sinclair for eight, leg before wicket without playing a shot. Quick bowler Lee had Craig Spearman brilliantly caught at third slip by Damien Martyn, before bowling nightwatchman Paul Wiseman with the day's last ball. </p> <p>The flat, brown pitch had more of a third or fourth-day look about it, providing considerable assistance for the spinners and some seam movement for the pace bowlers. New Zealand's spin duo of Daniel Vettori, orthodox left-arm, and the finger spinner Wiseman earlier did the job for their team in just 71 overs as they combined to skittle Australia. Vettori took his fourth bag of five wickets in Tests with his five for 62 off 25 overs, while Wiseman had his second-best Test total of four for 49. </p> <p>After the early loss of Michael Slater, who was bowled by Chris Cairns for five without offering a shot, Greg Blewett and Justin Langer raced along at a run a minute. At drinks, Australia were 64 for one, but then the collapse started. Langer, who made 46 off 47 balls, took a risk too many against Wiseman and was stumped by Adam Parore. </p> <p>Blewett followed soon after with the total on 78 and only No 4, Mark Waugh, stayed around for any length of time as the wickets tumbled at the other end. Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn both fell to Vettori for 17 to leave Australia on 138 for five before Mark Waugh pressed on to his thirty-eighth Test half-century in 132 minutes off 96 balls.<br></p> <p><strong> NEW ZEALAND V AUSTRALIA </strong></p> <p><strong>1st Test, day 1</strong> </p> <p><strong> Australia 1st innings</strong> </p> <p>M Slater b Cairns <strong> 5</strong> </p> <p>G Blewett c Astle b Wiseman <strong> 17</strong> </p> <p>J Langer st Parore b Wiseman <strong> 46</strong> </p> <p>M Waugh not out <strong> 72</strong> </p> <p>S Waugh c Spearman b Vettori <strong> 17</strong> </p> <p>D Martyn c Astle b Vettori <strong> 17</strong> </p> <p>A Gilchrist lbw b Wiseman <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p>S Warne c Fleming b Vettori <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p>B Lee c Parore b Vettori <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p>C Miller b Cairns <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p>G McGrath c Spearman b Vettori <strong> 8 </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b7, lb4, nb1) <strong> 12 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (all out, 71 overs) <strong> 214 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall of wickets: </strong> 1-10 2-77 3-78 4-114 5-138 6-161 7-184 8-192 9-193 10-214. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Cairns 18-0-71-2 (nb), Doull 14-6-21-0, Vettori 25-8-62-5, Wiseman 14-2-49-3. </p> <p><strong> New Zealand 1st innings</strong> </p> <p>M Horne c Blewett b McGrath <strong> 3</strong> </p> <p>C Spearman c Martyn b Lee <strong> 12</strong> </p> <p>M Sinclair lbw b Warne <strong> 8</strong> </p> <p>P Wiseman b Lee <strong> 1</strong> </p> <p>S Fleming not out <strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (nb2) <strong> 2 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 4 wkts, 17 overs) <strong> 26 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall of wickets:</strong> 1-5 2-25 3-25 4-26. </p> <p><strong> Bowling (to date): </strong> McGrath 7-2-12-1 (2nb), Miller 6-1-13-0, Warne 2-1-1-1, Lee 2-2-0-2.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fourteen wickets on the opening day left Australia, who were bowled out for 214 after winning the toss, in control of the first Test against New Zealand at Eden Park. Shane Warne and Brett Lee both took wickets with their second balls to reduce New Zealand's reply from 25 for one to 26 for four in the space of four overs. After Glenn McGrath, unerringly straight and fast, broke through with Matt Horne's dismissal, Warne's leg-spin removed No 3 Mathew Sinclair for eight, leg before wicket without playing a shot. Quick bowler Lee had Craig Spearman brilliantly caught at third slip by Damien Martyn, before bowling nightwatchman Paul Wiseman with the day's last ball. The flat, brown pitch had more of a third or fourth-day look about it, providing considerable assistance for the spinners and some seam movement for the pace bowlers. New Zealand's spin duo of Daniel Vettori, orthodox left-arm, and the finger spinner Wiseman earlier did the job for their team in just 71 overs as they combined to skittle Australia. Vettori took his fourth bag of five wickets in Tests with his five for 62 off 25 overs, while Wiseman had his second-best Test total of four for 49. After the early loss of Michael Slater, who was bowled by Chris Cairns for five without offering a shot, Greg Blewett and Justin Langer raced along at a run a minute. At drinks, Australia were 64 for one, but then the collapse started. Langer, who made 46 off 47 balls, took a risk too many against Wiseman and was stumped by Adam Parore. Blewett followed soon after with the total on 78 and only No 4, Mark Waugh, stayed around for any length of time as the wickets tumbled at the other end. Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn both fell to Vettori for 17 to leave Australia on 138 for five before Mark Waugh pressed on to his thirty-eighth Test half-century in 132 minutes off 96 balls.

      "body": "<p>'Tis but a scratch.' - Monty Python's Black Knight upon having an arm chopped off by King Arthur. </p> <p>Dion Dublin saw it coming. Sheffield Wednesday's Gerald Sibon, a mountain of a man, an immovable object, was suddenly blocking his stampede towards a loose ball. Too late for a diversion, nothing for it but to hunch his shoulders, tuck his head in, slam on the brakes and hope to cushion the impact. Ouch. </p> <p>A moment later the Aston Villa striker hauled himself up and wandered over to the dugout for a dose of the magic sponge. His neck was a bit painful but nothing out of the ordinary. So he told the physio, Jim Walker, to give him a couple of minutes to catch his breath and he'd get back in the fray. 'Tis but a bruise, thought Dublin to himself. </p> <p>'Can you move your neck all right?' asked Walker. </p> <p>'Not really,' Dublin replied, 'but it's just a bruise.' </p> <p>'Precaution, precaution, precaution,' countered Walker. </p> <p>A dozen medics and St John Ambulance staff were soon fussing around Dublin, working with the utmost caution as they tried to strap his head securely onto a stretcher. He was slightly concerned but mostly baffled to have caused this commotion while the game was still going on - it was only a bruised neck after all. How bad could it be? 'I couldn't feel anything, it was all numb, sort of out of my control,' he recalls. Next thing he remembers is waiting. Inexplicable waiting in a little medical room at Villa Park while the club doctor, Barry Smith, was hooked to the phone trying to track down a particular surgeon, the best in the Midlands, to check him over. Only a precaution of course. </p> <p>Dublin just wanted to get to hospital, get sorted, and get home - and an hour later they were finally on their way to hospital: 'The Doctor insisted that the ambulance went no faster then 30 mph, and later he told me that any bumps could have moved my neck half an inch and I would have been paralysed. I went straight into intensive care. They cut my kit off me and I must have had about 10 x-rays. Then the surgeon came in with his diagnosis. He's quite a confident man, bordering on arrogant because he's so good at his job. He waltzed in and said: \"Right Dion, you've broken your neck.\"' </p> <p>This one phrase smashed through his world like the single blow of a sledgehammer. 'That's when I broke down crying. My wife Louise broke down crying. I don't think I've ever felt as low as that. When he actually said those words I had nothing but an empty feeling. Every thing came to an abrupt end in my career and my life. I thought I'd lost everything. </p> <p>'The first thing I said was \"What about my football? I need to play football.\" He said: \"To be honest, Dion, you could be looking at a wheelchair you were so close to being paralysed.\" Then he explained the procedure. Frightening. Very, very scary position to be in. Very humbling. Most definitely.' Reflecting over it three months on he pauses, before a deep breath dissolves into a relieved, slightly self-conscious laugh, shaking his head at the madness of it all. </p> <p>The operation involved taking a graft from his hip to replace the crushed bone in his neck with a new piece of bone and knitting it into place with a plate and four screws. Now, he can't feel it at all. The scar has almost gone, blended into the natural creases where the neck bends. 'He went in through the front because it was easier to get to. I damaged the area on the inside, not the bones you can feel at the back of your neck. The surgeon is an amazing man. I'm indebted to him for a long, long time. I know I'm very, very lucky. I think I approach life in a different way now. I love every day. The majority of my life now will be spent with a smile on my face.' Dion Dublin, blessed with one of the sunniest natures in football even before he reassessed his lot, smiles broader than ever. </p> <p>Dublin, like most footballers, likes his routines. With a chunk ripped out of his professional life, and a huge contraption of a neck brace intruding on normal life, the whole football package had to be shut away: 'It was hard, not being able to turn around, to drive, even to pick up my kids to give them a kiss. But we overcome and become stronger.' As soon as the brace came off and he had enjoyed the benefits of a family holiday he was itching to get back to work. </p> <p>He'd been in contact with most of his team-mates on the phone and had gone to all Villa's home games, but had kept his distance. 'I was envious,' he admits. 'And I didn't want to go in there and make anyone think, \"Dion's broken his neck - bloody hell, that might happen to me.\" A bit of doubt can affect your game and I wanted to let the boys get on with it. Which they did, very well.' </p> <p>Last week he was back in the thick of the banter, ribbing Ian Taylor about his jumper and mocking Mark Draper about his car. But the most significant pointer that he is inching his way back into squad life took place out on the field in his first session with the first team. He was given permission to take part in a training game, and responded with relish. 'DIONNN!' screeched the flustered physio as he watched his convalescing patient dive into a challenge. </p> <p>It looks like he won't have much of a mental block to hurdle when the body is fully fit. 'I know I'll just go in where I left off to be honest. It will be the normal Dion Dublin where, if there's a challenge to be made, I'll make it. If I've got to put my head in when there are six studs coming at me to score a goal I'll do it. You can't hold back if that's the way you play. I want those challenges. That's why Jim Walker has let me back in with the first team, to get a little physical bumping around. When you're playing against big Ugo [Ehiogu] and Colin Calderwood and the Skipper [Gareth Southgate] you're going to get knocked about and that's what I need. </p> <p> <strong> 'I'VE STILL GOT</strong> to do a lot of running to get the strength back in my legs, and build up my shoulders to help my neck, so there's a lot of work to be done. We'll wait and see how the rehab goes but I'd love to play again this season. I wouldn't say no to a Cup Final. If I'm right and fit and I feel strong enough I'll be having a quiet word with the physio and the doctor and saying please, please, please. </p> <p>'My goals are still basically the same. I want to get back in the England squad. I want to play in Euro 2000 and in the next World Cup. Walking around in the Number Nine England shirt, singing the anthem at Wembley was an amazing experience. I enjoyed it so much I want more. I know it's not going to be easy, it will take time, and I might not make 2000 or 2002. But I'm going to have a bloody good go.' If his recovery continues in the bionic manner he has managed so far he could be back in contention for his club in around a month's time. </p> <p>'I'd better lap up all sympathy at the moment because when I start knocking heads around people aren't going to like me so much,' he adds, shaking his head on that reconstructed neck of his and grinning for England.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>This Bradford midfielder is thriving in an alien environment.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is not difficult to spot Jamie Lawrence among the quietly purposeful professionals of Valley Parade. It's not just the green hair either. No, what really sets the Londoner apart from his team-mates is that while everyone else is talking in hushed tones of today's derby opponents' mightily impressive defeat of Roma in midweek, Lawrence is telling radio reporters how he failed to watch Leeds United because it would have meant missing EastEnders . </p> <p>Subtlety is not Lawrence's style. Nor is Lawrence much impressed with the parts of the North and Midlands his four-club career has taken him to. He unwisely tried to commute between the capital and Leicester City, and though he now has a home in a reasonably lively part of West Yorkshire - 'Leeds is OK. Not London, but not bad for up here' - he has no intention of sticking around in the provinces when he finishes playing football. </p> <p>Refreshing as it is to talk to someone blunter than a stereotypical Yorkshireman, half of Lawrence's bravado is just an act. And if there is a reason why Lawrence comes over as loud and brash at first, it is almost certainly connected with the reason he ended up playing in the North while pining for the South. Although he had trials with Wimbledon, Millwall and Southend, clubs were not exactly beating a path to Lawrence's door once he was sent down for robbery. </p> <p>'I did three years and two months, I was 23 when I came out of my sentence and nobody wanted to know me,' he said. 'That's how I ended up at Sunderland, because I knew Terry Butcher and Ian Atkins. I went on the Monday, trained on the Tuesday, played against Leeds reserves on the Wednesday and I was in. Not that it was quite that easy. I ended up going to Doncaster to play first-team football.

      "bodyText": "It is not difficult to spot Jamie Lawrence among the quietly purposeful professionals of Valley Parade. It's not just the green hair either. No, what really sets the Londoner apart from his team-mates is that while everyone else is talking in hushed tones of today's derby opponents' mightily impressive defeat of Roma in midweek, Lawrence is telling radio reporters how he failed to watch Leeds United because it would have meant missing EastEnders . Subtlety is not Lawrence's style. Nor is Lawrence much impressed with the parts of the North and Midlands his four-club career has taken him to. He unwisely tried to commute between the capital and Leicester City, and though he now has a home in a reasonably lively part of West Yorkshire - 'Leeds is OK. Not London, but not bad for up here' - he has no intention of sticking around in the provinces when he finishes playing football. Refreshing as it is to talk to someone blunter than a stereotypical Yorkshireman, half of Lawrence's bravado is just an act. And if there is a reason why Lawrence comes over as loud and brash at first, it is almost certainly connected with the reason he ended up playing in the North while pining for the South. Although he had trials with Wimbledon, Millwall and Southend, clubs were not exactly beating a path to Lawrence's door once he was sent down for robbery. 'I did three years and two months, I was 23 when I came out of my sentence and nobody wanted to know me,' he said. 'That's how I ended up at Sunderland, because I knew Terry Butcher and Ian Atkins. I went on the Monday, trained on the Tuesday, played against Leeds reserves on the Wednesday and I was in. Not that it was quite that easy. I ended up going to Doncaster to play first-team football. I didn't mind. 'I always thought I was good enough to go higher, but particularly at that level it's hard when everybody knows you've been inside. They don't let you forget.' Lawrence doesn't mind talking about it now, partly because 'it's not exactly a secret', and partly because if there is anyone else out there struggling to overcome the same thing he would like to offer encouragement by example.

Other Belgian cities hosting Euro 2000 matches - Bruges, Liege and Brussels - are also carrying out an inventory of their available cells. </p> <p>Rompen said Charleroi faced the particular problem of thousands of fans being unable to get into the 30,000-capacity stadium and wandering around the town instead. 'Only 16 per cent of seats have been reserved for the two teams' supporters,' De Morgen said. </p> <p>'They are not all hooligans but they will probably all run around the streets,' he explained. 'The mayor has said that there will be no alcohol ban in the town, so we have based our strategy on zero tolerance instead.' One strike, it seems, and you're in the garage. </p> <p> <strong> Anguilla win...</strong><br>Anguilla - Fifa's smallest member nation and bottom of the world rankings - have won their first match. The island nation first featured in this column in March last year after they scored a rare goal against Grenada in a 14-1 defeat. At the time, government spokesman Elkin Rogers told us he was concerned about the nation's footballing future. 'Yes, it's indistinct,' said Rogers. 'We really do have very few prospects.' They also had no manager: after a 6-0 defeat to St Lucia, and subsequent 14-0, 7-0 and 9-0 defeats to the likes of Gaudeloupe, Les Strong, the former Fulham defender, disappeared. A year on, though, and Anguilla have turned the corner. Despite having only 75 registered players from a population of 9,000, the team lost just 3-1 to the Bahamas last month, and then sparkled as they've never sparkled before against the British Virgin Islands. Despite three key players - Kevin Hawley, Tyrone Benjamin, and Andre 'Sour' Griffith - missing the bus and not arriving until half-time, the side took a four-goal lead, and held out for a 4-3 win - the first in Anguilla's footballing history. The return leg wasn't so good: after seven of the 11 starters picked up injuries they lost 5-0 - but still, congratulations boys. </p> <p> <strong> Upset ref calls it quits</strong><br>Experienced Belgian referee Amand Ancion quit his job in tears last week after disallowing a valid goal in a First Division game between Mouscron and Charleroi. The 45-year-old, on Uefa's list for Euro 2000, told Belgian television immediately after the game that he was 'distraught'. 'I really don't know what will become of me without refereeing.' The goal was scored when Charleroi's Enzo Biondo was lying on the ground injured. Instead of sportingly kicking the ball into touch, Mouscron's Axel Lawaree scored - only for Ancion to rule it out on moral grounds. It seems to have been the final straw for Ancion, who is still suffering the repercussions of his performance in a league game between Westerlo and Genk last August. In the 6-6 draw, he issued 12 yellow cards, four reds and five penalities. He'll be missed. </p> <p> <strong> More on Mellor: end in sight?</strong>BR&gt;Last week we questioned the purpose of David Mellor. A week on, no one seems any closer to an answer. Given the chance on Wednesday to withdraw his controversial dismissal of the government-backed Crystal Palace Supporters Trust, Mellor, apparently unprepared for his 5 Live phone-in, picked up where he left off. 'You lot just don't want it enough,' Mellor told another caller. 'I don't know why I let you guys on the show.' Two days later he carried on in the London Evening Standard. 'For the past two weeks I've had leading lights from the Crystal Palace fans' buy-out campaign on my Radio 5 Live phone-in, and each time I've ended up deeply fed up with them ... You must be joking, fellows.' Crystal Palace and the Trust, Mellor explained, are 'finished', and 'what's more, they deserve to be'. </p> <p>Bosses at 5 Live now admit to being confused by Mellor's recent form - and, having already shunted him out of the prime-time 606 Saturday slot, are said to be 'concerned' by his increasing unpredictability. So does the 'voice of the fans' have a long-term future at 5 Live?

Instead of sportingly kicking the ball into touch, Mouscron's Axel Lawaree scored - only for Ancion to rule it out on moral grounds. It seems to have been the final straw for Ancion, who is still suffering the repercussions of his performance in a league game between Westerlo and Genk last August. In the 6-6 draw, he issued 12 yellow cards, four reds and five penalities. He'll be missed. More on Mellor: end in sight?BR&gt;Last week we questioned the purpose of David Mellor. A week on, no one seems any closer to an answer. Given the chance on Wednesday to withdraw his controversial dismissal of the government-backed Crystal Palace Supporters Trust, Mellor, apparently unprepared for his 5 Live phone-in, picked up where he left off. 'You lot just don't want it enough,' Mellor told another caller. 'I don't know why I let you guys on the show.' Two days later he carried on in the London Evening Standard. 'For the past two weeks I've had leading lights from the Crystal Palace fans' buy-out campaign on my Radio 5 Live phone-in, and each time I've ended up deeply fed up with them ... You must be joking, fellows.' Crystal Palace and the Trust, Mellor explained, are 'finished', and 'what's more, they deserve to be'. Bosses at 5 Live now admit to being confused by Mellor's recent form - and, having already shunted him out of the prime-time 606 Saturday slot, are said to be 'concerned' by his increasing unpredictability. So does the 'voice of the fans' have a long-term future at 5 Live? BBC insiders, we're pleased to report, think not.

While Dick Advocaat succeeded Walter Smith as manager at Ibrox less than a month after that cup final and began jettisoning the old and spending the \u00a330 million that would bring in the new, Jim Jefferies at Tynecastle faced the prospect of losing many of his players without his consent. </p> <p>Rangers themselves took winger Neil McCann and seem certain to add defender Paul Ritchie when the latter's loan period at Bolton is up at the end of this season, Everton removed David Weir and others such as Dave McPherson, Stefano Salvatori and Jim Hamilton left the club for a variety of reasons. 'What a lot of people don't understand and don't take into account,' said Jefferies, 'is that, when teams outside the Old Firm do have a little success, our players become targets for the bigger clubs. Rangers and Celtic don't have this problem to the same degree. So it means rebuilding a squad and that doesn't happen overnight. </p> <p>'The team who won the cup for us and who challenged for the league championship until the last couple of weeks of the season in 1998 had itself taken a good two years to assemble and it's only now that we are beginning to see the rebuilt side coming together. Since the winter break in January, we've only had one poor performance in eight games, when we lost to Kilmarnock in the League Cup quarter-finals. </p> <p>'But we've won four and drawn the other of our five league matches, we've won two Scottish Cup ties and we've had four clean sheets in a row. We're probably better defensively now than we have been for a while, maybe even better than the '98 team. I think, too, that this present side is capable of playing better football than the one from two years ago, but they've still to prove that consistently.' </p> <p>Much of the credit for Hearts' recent resurgence - as well as the last eight of the cup, they have climbed to fourth in the Premier League, with a chance of making Europe - has been given to Robert Tomascheck, the midfielder signed from Slovan Bratislava for just \u00a3380,000. The 27-year-old Slovakian is another example of Jefferies' astuteness in the market, joining Antti Niemi, the goalkeeper from Rangers, and Gordan Petric, the former Dundee United and Rangers defender, to make up a trio who cost a total of only \u00a31 million. </p> <p>Jefferies had been under a certain pressure to spend, spectacularly from support ers who had been misled into believing he had \u00a34 million at his disposal following the deal that brought \u00a38 million into the club when Scottish Media Group bought a stake. </p> <p>Much of the new money helped to clear debt, but the \u00a34 million said to have been allocated to the manager was to be spread 'over the next two or three seasons'. 'What I was actually told,' said Jefferies, 'was that I could have \u00a31 million to \u00a31.5 million this season, so it had to be spent wisely. I've always been used to looking for bargains, but what having a little money does is it slightly broadens your horizon. We had to strengthen various departments and we've done that with a goalkeeper, a defender and a midfielder. Now we're looking to bring in a different type of striker from the guys already here, to give us variation.' </p> <p>Jefferies was also criticised, during a lean spell earlier in the season, for not fielding Tomascheck, but he was giving the Slovakian time to settle. 'When it came to playing Celtic at Parkhead, we knew he would be all right for that,' said the manager. 'He has 53 caps for Slovakia, so we knew he wouldn't be fazed by the occasion and that's how it turned out. He's doing really well. In fact, he's a much different player from the one we thought we were buying. </p> <p>'Having seen him and watched videos, we thought he was purely a defensive midfielder, but he is much more. He's not just a \"sitter\", but has great mobility around the pitch. He doesn't just break things up in deep position, but can set things off in forward areas. Niemi has done well, too, and Petric is settling in much better now and giving good performances.' </p> <p>All of Hearts' improvement and all the self-belief Jefferies can impart will surely be required tonight against a Rangers team whose appetite for trophies remains undiminished. </p>",

To that end, out-of-favour Bradford striker Lee Mills, who made his debut here alongside top scorer Shaun Goater, has been brought in on loan until the end of the season. Mills has only scored five times in the Premiership this season, but he scored 24 times to help the Bantams secure promotion from Division One last season and Royle clearly feels Goater is not yet receiving consistent enough support from Robert Taylor, who has scored just three times since his move from Gillingham. Craig Hignett was back in place of Georgi Hristov for Barnsley, as manager Dave Bassett tried to break a run of three straight draws at home. </p> <p>Bassett's decision paid immediate dividends when Hignett broke clear down the right hand side and won a corner off Jeff Whitley after just four minutes. Darren Barnard's clever ball to the edge of the box deceived the City defence and John Curtis, the England Under-21 defender on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season, stroked a 20-yard drive through a crowded box into the bottom corner. </p> <p>City could have equalised almost immediately when Barnsley keeper Kevin Miller dropped a Mark Kennedy corner, but the ball was scrambled clear. Barnsley might have extended their lead when Richard Jobson fouled Neil Shipperley on the edge of the box, Barnard's free-kick whistling narrowly over. </p> <p>But Barnsley did score again, Hignett racing clear from Mark Tinkler's pass, and slotting the ball home under Weaver's body. The closest Mills came to scoring before the break came when he found a yard of space in the box, but his shot was deflected for a corner. </p> <p>Ian Bishop came on for Danny Granville at half-time as City came back strongly. They enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure, but failed to create anything clear-cut. Their best efforts came when Kennedy pulled a shot across the face of goal, and Jamie Pollock shot high over. </p> <p>Barnsley soaked up the pressure and begun threaten ing on the break. A goal-mouth scramble saw a Neil Shipperley effort blocked and Tinkler's follow up well saved by Weaver. Hignett should have made absolutely sure of the points when he found himself one on one with Miller again, but he seemed to hesitate, and Miller stuck out a leg to parry the shot. </p> <p>City did hit the post when Pollock fired in from five yards, but it was an isolated attack, Barnsley creating by far the most chances. Shipperley seemed certain to score before Danny Tiatto deflected his shot, while Weaver dived acrobatically to keep out Hignett from 20 yards. </p> <p>Goater gave City hope when he managed to squeeze between two defenders and bundle home after Miller failed to gather Kennedy's chip with four minutes to go. Although City poured forward in a tense last few minutes, Barnsley held firm to claim the points. </p>",

City could have equalised almost immediately when Barnsley keeper Kevin Miller dropped a Mark Kennedy corner, but the ball was scrambled clear. Barnsley might have extended their lead when Richard Jobson fouled Neil Shipperley on the edge of the box, Barnard's free-kick whistling narrowly over. But Barnsley did score again, Hignett racing clear from Mark Tinkler's pass, and slotting the ball home under Weaver's body. The closest Mills came to scoring before the break came when he found a yard of space in the box, but his shot was deflected for a corner. Ian Bishop came on for Danny Granville at half-time as City came back strongly. They enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure, but failed to create anything clear-cut. Their best efforts came when Kennedy pulled a shot across the face of goal, and Jamie Pollock shot high over. Barnsley soaked up the pressure and begun threaten ing on the break. A goal-mouth scramble saw a Neil Shipperley effort blocked and Tinkler's follow up well saved by Weaver. Hignett should have made absolutely sure of the points when he found himself one on one with Miller again, but he seemed to hesitate, and Miller stuck out a leg to parry the shot. City did hit the post when Pollock fired in from five yards, but it was an isolated attack, Barnsley creating by far the most chances. Shipperley seemed certain to score before Danny Tiatto deflected his shot, while Weaver dived acrobatically to keep out Hignett from 20 yards. Goater gave City hope when he managed to squeeze between two defenders and bundle home after Miller failed to gather Kennedy's chip with four minutes to go. Although City poured forward in a tense last few minutes, Barnsley held firm to claim the points.",

It was just before Christmas and the village was glittering with lights and with the restive energy of the holiday, as distant family members came home from the Bronx or north London, cargoed with duty-free booze and cigarettes. They stayed at the pub until around midnight. (The garda\u00ed are more lenient about closing times over the holidays.) When they left, Bailey bought a Guinness to take with him.</p> <p>It was a splendid night, frosty and clear, with a winter-solstice moon overhead, lighting that numinous landscape of ocean and stone. Their old car bounced home towards the Prairie. When they arrived, Bailey, a little drunk and inspired by the hallucinatory beauty of the winter stars, decided to walk over to his studio cottage, some 200 yards away, and write, while Jules went to bed. This much Bailey told police during the course of his first questioning, in February 1997.</p> <p>But the garda\u00ed have had to struggle to figure out what happened next, and why. There are no witnesses. According to Bailey, when he finished writing, at one o'clock in the morning, he went home to bed. He could have driven or sauntered the few miles over the frost-hard earth towards his neighbour's house. He was probably still drunk. Bailey maintains that he did not know Sophie personally, though he had, of course, seen her once or twice. After one in the morning, she was either preparing for bed or had already gone to sleep.</p> <p>The winter night was long, and stone farmhouses remain stubbornly cold, despite central heating. Would she have welcomed a visit? Was she propositioned by the intruder? Did her refusal kindle rage in her murderer? Her husband imagined such a possibility: 'They say it was not a sexual crime,' he told Le Figaro. 'But that might have been the trigger. Someone might have wanted to seduce, to rape her. She refuses, resists, and it all goes wrong.'</p> <p>Petty crime is the stuff of a local garda's life. The man from whom we bought our farmhouse, for example, had been busted for growing marijuana in the garden, and there is the odd instance of after-hours drinking, drunk driving, or bootleg spirits. But local police had yet to encounter a murder investigation, let alone one that might involve nationals of three countries. Long before the state pathologist arrived at the scene of the crime, Ian Bailey had already spent time there, alerted, it seems, by the Cork Examiner. Soon, other reporters and photographers arrived, walking around the house, trudging across the grass, leaving fibres of their clothing and strands of their hair everywhere, and the story of Sophie's murder made it to French television before Irish police had even managed to contact her husband.</p> <p>'I was alone in front of my television set trying to understand what had happened,' du Plantier said in his Figaro interview. 'That night, at about 10pm, my son called Ireland. It was the housekeeper who answered and said, \"I can't talk to you.\" Right away, we were treated with suspicion... Finally, it was the [French] Minister of Foreign Affairs, Herv\u00e9 de Charette, who informed me officially that Sophie had been murdered.'</p> <p>A few days later, police were contacted by a mystery caller who seemed to have privileged information about the murder. Then, typically, the line was disconnected. (West Cork, at the time, did not have a modern telephone service - it was only recently made digital.) The chief superintendent appeared on television to ask the caller to call back.</p> <p>Then the garda\u00ed arrested Bailey, telling Sophie's husband, 'We've got him. He is in the car.' Whatever they had, he was released after 12 hours of questioning. 'Rarely have police been so sure of their suspicions and at the same time so incapable of finding the evidence,' du Plantier said. 'I criticise them for throwing out his name with such incredible recklessness. Because if there is one chance in a hundred that he is innocent, it is terrifying.'</p> <p>Bailey continued to cover the murder for the tabloids, at times supplying 'breaking news' and displaying an unexpected intimacy with the details of the crime. (This was not so surprising, perhaps, since he had also worked as a gardener for Sophie's next-door neighbour.) For certain articles, he withheld his byline. In one paper, Bailey reported that Sophie had had 'a tangled love life' and had been planning to remarry her first husband. Partly at his suggestion, the investigation turned to France: 'Sur La Piste De L'amant Fran\u00e7ais' ('On The Trail Of The French Lover'), as one French daily announced.</p> <p>Suspicion fell briefly on a volatile former lover, with whom Sophie had already had a run-in: he had allegedly tried to strangle her in the Paris Metro. But an inquiry established that he had not been in Ireland at the time of the murder. The garda\u00ed also looked into the possibility that it had been a contract killing. Christmas in Ireland is not an easy time to keep track of incoming visitors, and a professional could easily have evaded airport video cameras by arriving on the car ferry into Cork or Rosslare, and then driving west. But West Cork is a complicated landscape and there are few detailed maps and even fewer signposts. A stranger asking for directions to Sophie's house would have stood out.</p> <p>In the weeks following the murder, the garda\u00ed interviewed more than a thousand people, unearthing any number of wife- beaters, dole-exploiters, drug traffickers, and illegal residents. But they seemed convinced that Bailey was their man. There were his strangely knowledgeable newspaper reports and interviews about the crime. And there were those scratches on his head and hands, as well as his history of domestic violence.</p> <p>That April, the chief superintendent submitted a 2,000-page file to the director of public prosecutions, in Dublin - '2,000 pages of rumours,' according to Bailey. Since then, the garda\u00ed have not been allowed to speak about the case, and, despite increasingly aggravated pleas, authorities in France, who had initiated their own investigation into the murder, were denied access to this file. The Irish minister of justice claimed that releasing the documents would compromise the ongoing investigation - which by that time had kept 60 garda\u00ed employed for four months, but had not resulted in any charges.</p> <p>Locals continued to discuss the crime in low voices. Why couldn't the police either charge Bailey or exonerate him? they asked. Surely Sophie would have had foreign DNA on her body, since she had fought off her attacker. Had it been made unreadable by the delay in examining the body? One fact that did slip out was that the blood found under Sophie's fingernails and the hair she was clutching were her own: she must have tried to protect her head against her attacker's hammering blows.</p> <p>In December 1997, Sophie's family came to West Cork to attend a memorial service at the local church. It was a typically raw and misty morning, and we were a subdued crowd of 60 or so. The choir sang in Irish and many wept as Sophie's aunt, Marie Madeleine Opalka, made a pleasantly accented plea from the altar. Sophie 'fully loved your country and its beauty and the kindness of the people,' she said. 'We want to ask you something from the depths of our hearts. Someone among you may have information or know something - please, please, give it to the police.' It was uncannily like the church scene in The Field, John B Keane's violent play about a stranger bludgeoned to death in the west of Ireland.</p> <p>Afterwards, we dodged the rain and bundled into the priest's house for coffee with the family, as a garda car and a few taut men in black coats waited at the gate. Opalka told me that her niece had invited her to come with her to Ireland the previous December and that she would forever regret having declined. 'Thank God Monsieur Bailey has not come today,' she added.</p> <p>Bailey has not hidden from the publicity surrounding his possible role in Sophie's murder. And, if he doesn't actually enjoy his notoriety, he at least remains unruffled by it. In fact, he seems to have found inspiration in his plight. In one poem, entitled 'The Prisoner' he even compares his trials to those of Jesus: 'a man who slept peacefully/while his disciples panicked'.</p> <p>When Brighid McLaughlin, a reporter for Ireland's Sunday Independent, travelled to Schull for an interview with Bailey in July 1997, he was initially brusque on the phone, announcing that his lawyer had instructed him not to speak about the crime. The same day, however, he appeared in the foyer of her hotel. According to McLaughlin, he had become an expert on the case and discussed theories and counter-theories with excitement. Despite his lawyer's admonition, she said, 'Bailey does talk. He simply can't stop.' The casual way he referred to the murdered woman as 'Sophie', as though he had become intimate with her in the aftermath of the crime, was troubling, she said. When McLaughlin asked how he had survived 12 hours of questioning, he replied: 'The garda\u00ed lost their temper, not me. They seemed to completely forget that they were up against a seasoned journalist... I meditated through the interrogation.'</p> <p>In Le Figaro, Daniel du Plantier also expressed his surprise at Bailey's behaviour: 'The OJ Simpson story is having babies... Bailey has chosen to court the media... And now he has an amazing new profession: \"I am not the killer of Sophie Toscan du Plantier.\" If I were in his place and I were innocent, I would have run away and changed my name and my life.'</p> <p>But Bailey's behaviour after the murder seemed to fit his general pattern. From the beginning of his time in West Cork he had been outspoken and flamboyant and had failed to display the tact of a newcomer. His neighbours were often irritated by him, and considered his adoption of 'Irish ways' a kind of masquerade.</p> <p>It is highly possible that a great many locals, including, perhaps, the garda\u00ed, would have been pleased to put him away for this murder simply because they did not approve of him.</p> <p>On 27 January 1998, Bailey's 42nd birthday, he was arrested for the second time - this time by the Dublin-based National Bureau for Criminal Investigation - and some of his belongings were seized. Again, he was released after 12 hours for lack of evidence. According to Irish law, Bailey can be arrested a third time, but only if charges are brought against him. If the French authorities had had their way, he could have been charged, jailed, and put under investigation, and the famous Brigade Criminelle might not have been as fair in its methods as its Irish counterparts.</p> <p>Sophie's family returned to Cork for the second and third anniversaries of her death to attend memorial services. A small Celtic cross, with Sophie's name, now stands on the ground where she was murdered, and locals often leave flowers there. The house itself remains empty, and is already a source of fearful legend.</p> <p>Since Sophie's death, Daniel Toscan du Plantier has not visited the house that he bought for her.</p> <p>He married for the fourth time, in June 1998, after declaring that 'one must respond to death with life', and his new wife gave birth to their child shortly afterwards. But he continues to harry the Irish authorities through his Paris lawyer.</p> <p>Those authorities have not done much to mend their reputation. Although they appointed an assistant state pathologist soon after Sophie's death, when another French couple was found dead last year, this time in North Cork, there was again a delay - this time of 30 hours - before the pathologist arrived on the scene.</p> <p>Bailey maintains his extraordinary sang-froid. He was recently hauled in for drunk driving, fined heavily, and banned from the road for four years. This was perhaps part of an attempt to make him crack, but he and his lawyer are mounting a counter-campaign, contending that the garda\u00ed deliberately released his name to the press when such information should have been confidential. His lawyer has also made it clear that Bailey is in financial difficulty, 'finding it hard to find work as a landscape gardener'.</p> <p>Since the murder, he has continued to phone me from time to time. On one occasion, he wanted to discuss 'The Battle of the Trees' in Robert Graves's The White Goddess, which has been adopted by New Agers as a holy book. Knowing that I had been friendly with the old wizard Graves, Ian asked me about the lines: 'The holly, dark green/Made a resolute stand;/He is armed with many spear-points/Wounding the hand.' The image reminded me of the Christmas tree Ian had said caused the scratches on his face and hands the night of the murder.</p> <p>When Elizabeth and I called to tell him we were writing about him, he was helpful, giving us the name of his lawyer and of a French journalist he thought had handled the case well.</p> <p>He had recited a poem of mine the night before and wondered how I would do as a crime reporter. As we were about to say goodbye, he interrupted abruptly: 'I'd better go. If I don't put the parsnips in the oven, Jules will kill me.'</p> <p>Then, in early summer, we attended a benefit for Kosovo refugees at the Galley Inn. Night after night, we had been gazing at news images of sorrow and terror, so the cheerful, smoky pub was at once incongruous and soothing. As Elizabeth and I were moving through the crush toward the front door, Ian and Jules walked in. We were immediately struck by how much Ian had changed. He seemed heavier, with a slower walk. His face was pallid, and he had cropped his long black hair. Jules, however, looked poised and polished. But there was a wary look in her eyes. She talked briefly with Elizabeth about her involvement with the local benefits for Kosovo.</p> <p>As Ian was working his way to the back of the pub, we stopped him to discuss this article. He told us that he didn't want his photograph taken. 'The matter is closed,' he explained. 'It's in the past now, and I want to put it behind me.'</p> <p>As he announced this, people in the bar around us stared at him and murmured to one another. It was clear that the matter was not closed as far as they were concerned. And the garda\u00ed is sustaining its investigation, despite the frustrating absence of forensic evidence, hoping for a breakthrough.</p> <p>What must it feel like to be surrounded by such implacable suspicion if one is not guilty - to be the classic scapegoat?</p> <p>And how will it all end? Another former gardener of mine, Kevin O'Mahoney, had a theory about what one Irish prime minister referred to as 'blow-ins' - foreign settlers in Ireland. 'Mental dwarfs we are for them,' he said; they see the Irish as simple-minded and easily managed. Bailey has run rings around his interlocutors and he has summed up the case succinctly: 'No witnesses, no murder weapon, no forensic evidence, no motive. It will take a long time.'</p> <p>Perhaps there will be no real conclusion, and the cloud that settled over West Cork in the aftermath of the murder will gradually dissipate, leaving only the faint impression of fear and foreboding it brought to a place that had not been similarly sullied for decades. Yet there is something too distilled and concentrated about this story for it to disappear quickly. It seems to be part of a particularly European drama - for which West Cork is only one of many stages.</p> <p>The village of Schull is certainly not the only remote town to have become the unexpected focus of a much criticised international murder investigation over the past few years. When a 13-year-old English girl was raped and smothered in a hostel in the village of Pleine-Foug\u00e8res, in Brittany, in 1996, the local French police came under fire for not releasing details and for not immediately ordering DNA tests on local men. Like the West Cork garda\u00ed, they probably knew little about DNA evidence, apart from what they had seen on television. The girl's parents, who managed to get the chief investigator on the case removed, called for a Europe-wide DNA database that could prevent murderers from escaping by slipping across borders.</p> <p>In this story, and others, the problems of national identity and the absence of any pan-European police force have become obvious: clashes of legal systems and cultural practices, the tensions within small rural communities that are suddenly flooded with foreigners. When we asked an English friend whether he felt that his Irish neighbours were more hostile now, in the wake of this crime involving outsiders, he replied sadly that the locals were too polite to speak of it, but 'their silence is deafening'.</p> <p>Not long ago, I glanced out the window of our farmhouse to see a man in a bulldozer barrelling down our road, the teeth of his machine tearing the flowering hedge. When I hurried out to stop him, he cried, 'What do you know, you're just a blow-in!' I had never experienced such xenophobic rancour in tolerant West Cork. I quashed him by rebuking him in Irish - which he didn't understand - but my satisfaction was short-lived. There was a new tension in the air.</p> <p>John Montague's latest book is Smashing the Piano.

Knowing that I had been friendly with the old wizard Graves, Ian asked me about the lines: 'The holly, dark green/Made a resolute stand;/He is armed with many spear-points/Wounding the hand.' The image reminded me of the Christmas tree Ian had said caused the scratches on his face and hands the night of the murder. When Elizabeth and I called to tell him we were writing about him, he was helpful, giving us the name of his lawyer and of a French journalist he thought had handled the case well. He had recited a poem of mine the night before and wondered how I would do as a crime reporter. As we were about to say goodbye, he interrupted abruptly: 'I'd better go. If I don't put the parsnips in the oven, Jules will kill me.' Then, in early summer, we attended a benefit for Kosovo refugees at the Galley Inn. Night after night, we had been gazing at news images of sorrow and terror, so the cheerful, smoky pub was at once incongruous and soothing. As Elizabeth and I were moving through the crush toward the front door, Ian and Jules walked in. We were immediately struck by how much Ian had changed. He seemed heavier, with a slower walk. His face was pallid, and he had cropped his long black hair. Jules, however, looked poised and polished. But there was a wary look in her eyes. She talked briefly with Elizabeth about her involvement with the local benefits for Kosovo. As Ian was working his way to the back of the pub, we stopped him to discuss this article. He told us that he didn't want his photograph taken. 'The matter is closed,' he explained. 'It's in the past now, and I want to put it behind me.' As he announced this, people in the bar around us stared at him and murmured to one another. It was clear that the matter was not closed as far as they were concerned. And the garda\u00ed is sustaining its investigation, despite the frustrating absence of forensic evidence, hoping for a breakthrough. What must it feel like to be surrounded by such implacable suspicion if one is not guilty - to be the classic scapegoat? And how will it all end? Another former gardener of mine, Kevin O'Mahoney, had a theory about what one Irish prime minister referred to as 'blow-ins' - foreign settlers in Ireland. 'Mental dwarfs we are for them,' he said; they see the Irish as simple-minded and easily managed. Bailey has run rings around his interlocutors and he has summed up the case succinctly: 'No witnesses, no murder weapon, no forensic evidence, no motive. It will take a long time.' Perhaps there will be no real conclusion, and the cloud that settled over West Cork in the aftermath of the murder will gradually dissipate, leaving only the faint impression of fear and foreboding it brought to a place that had not been similarly sullied for decades. Yet there is something too distilled and concentrated about this story for it to disappear quickly. It seems to be part of a particularly European drama - for which West Cork is only one of many stages. The village of Schull is certainly not the only remote town to have become the unexpected focus of a much criticised international murder investigation over the past few years. When a 13-year-old English girl was raped and smothered in a hostel in the village of Pleine-Foug\u00e8res, in Brittany, in 1996, the local French police came under fire for not releasing details and for not immediately ordering DNA tests on local men. Like the West Cork garda\u00ed, they probably knew little about DNA evidence, apart from what they had seen on television. The girl's parents, who managed to get the chief investigator on the case removed, called for a Europe-wide DNA database that could prevent murderers from escaping by slipping across borders. In this story, and others, the problems of national identity and the absence of any pan-European police force have become obvious: clashes of legal systems and cultural practices, the tensions within small rural communities that are suddenly flooded with foreigners. When we asked an English friend whether he felt that his Irish neighbours were more hostile now, in the wake of this crime involving outsiders, he replied sadly that the locals were too polite to speak of it, but 'their silence is deafening'. Not long ago, I glanced out the window of our farmhouse to see a man in a bulldozer barrelling down our road, the teeth of his machine tearing the flowering hedge. When I hurried out to stop him, he cried, 'What do you know, you're just a blow-in!' I had never experienced such xenophobic rancour in tolerant West Cork. I quashed him by rebuking him in Irish - which he didn't understand - but my satisfaction was short-lived. There was a new tension in the air. John Montague's latest book is Smashing the Piano. Elizabeth Wassell is the author of The Honey Plain and Sleight of Hand, both published by Wolfhound Press, Dublin. She has just finished her third novel, The Thing He Loves",

      "body": "<p>The vanity of having one's photograph taken with any famous person who happens to be passing has always been abhorrent to me. But I have succumbed on two occasions, which is why there are two special photographs on my bookcase. In one I am with Sir Stanley Matthews, in the other it's George Best. </p> <p>And I wanted those photographs not because of their fame but to remind me of our friendships over many years. So the news that Best had been rushed to hospital only a week after Sir Stanley's funeral left me praying for his full recovery. </p> <p>It still amazes me that two men who possessed such identical soccer genius could be so completely different off the field. On the right wing a great knight, on the left a great night-out. </p> <p>I never saw Sir Stanley with an alcoholic drink in his hand and I seldom saw George without one. My photograph with the mighty Matthews was taken when he lived in Malta and had chauffeured me around the island for two days. I don't even know if George can drive but there is no way I'd get into a car if he was behind the wheel. </p> <p>But, although there are many stories told about the effects drink sometimes has on Best, I have only ever seen the lovable side of the man when he's had a few too many, a man who is only too happy to be his own biggest critic. </p> <p>'I went to Toronto and saw a sign saying \"Drink Canada Dry\" so that's what I did,' is a line he was happy to borrow from Brendan Behan. </p> <p>And he still delights in telling the Seventies story of the night a hotel room-service waiter delivered champagne after Best had won handsomely in a casino while escorting Marjorie Wallace, the reigning Miss World. Pound notes and his date littered the bed and as George prepared to pop the bubbly the waiter shook his head and asked: 'George, where did it all go wrong?' </p> <p>But there is a harder, underlying message to that story, because Best tells it not to impress the listener or even to deride himself. He uses it to prove that he didn't throw away a career, he deliberately walked away from it, even though it wasn't always in a straight line. </p> <p>'People are upset that I finished playing at Manchester United when I did, not for my sake but for their own,' he once told me. 'They don't really care what happened to me, all they worry about is that they couldn't see me play any more. If I'd wanted to I would have, but I didn't so what's the problem?' </p> <p>I went to Edinburgh to see George after a famous drinking spree soon after he joined Hibs on a short-term contract. </p> <p>Unfortunately for George, the French rugby team were also staying in his hotel and he ran into them as they were celebrating their victory at Murrayfield. He was still at it the following day when he should have been playing for Hibs. </p> <p>'Why did you do it, George?' I asked. </p> <p>'Well, they were very hospitable people and it seemed churlish not to have a drink with them,' he replied. </p> <p>'But why go on for so long?' </p> <p>'Don't forget there were 15 of them and only one of me,' said George. </p> <p>Best can no more explain why he drinks so hard at times any more than he can tell you why or how he once performed such outrageous acts of magic on the pitch. 'It seemed a good idea at the time' is his answer to both questions. </p> <p>I first got to know George well when we did a series together for the Sunday People. It involved some long sessions together, but he was then engaged to his first wife, Angie, who kept trying to drag him away from the person she described as 'that boring little man who only wants to talk about football'. </p> <p>She was to be just the first lady in George's life I would meet. The second was because of a most extraordinary coincidence while I was in Australia covering a British Lions rugby tour. </p> <p>We arrived in Canberra and I walked into my hotel bar to find George in the corner accompanied by his then girlfriend, Mary. He was on one of his after-dinner speaking jaunts and invited me to join him the following evening. As he answered questions from the floor, he introduced me to the audience as 'one of the pressmen I can trust' and suddenly I was in the firing line as well. </p> <p>'Is George the best player you ever saw, if not who is?' I was asked. I answered honestly: 'No, he's the second best. Pele is number one on my list.' On the way back to the hotel, George was very quiet in the car before saying: 'I thought you were a friend of mine.' </p> <p>'What makes you think I'm not?' </p> <p>'You said Pele was better than me.' </p> <p>I realised he wasn't joking and I tried to explain. He listened, then said: 'Do you think if I had played for Brazil and Pele played for Northern Ireland, you'd still be saying the same thing?' It's a question I still find difficult to answer. </p> <p>The other memorable moment that night came as we sat in the bar with the two men who had organised his tour. Mary, looking like a vision, suggested to George it was time for bed. Needless to say, he didn't argue and as they left the bar one of the men turned to me and said: 'Now why would he want to go to bed with her when he could sit all night with us and talk football?' And he was serious. </p> <p>Now george is with second wife, Alex, and also has his excellent agent, Philip Hughes, to help him, which is just as well because most of the problems in his life have come when he's tried to run his own affairs. About six years ago, he agreed to meet me in a wine bar he then owned in London to do an article about the forthcoming football season. I sat for two hours with no sign of George before being summoned to the telephone. </p> <p>'Sorry Brian, but I've been tied up with someone slightly more important than you but if you care to join us we're in a pub just down the road.' </p> <p>I was not best pleased until I realised George was in fact paying me a compliment because the person I was only slightly-less-important than was cricket legend Denis Compton, with whom he had already consumed three bottles of champagne. By the time we'd seen off six it was obvious the interview was off. </p> <p>But that was the only time he's ever let me down. He once even agreed to have his beard shaved off to help a charity with which I was involved. And for me to now start lecturing him about giving up the booze, the worst case in history of black pots and kettles. </p> <p>All I will say is that when our prayers are answered and he is back in good health George might in future try to make a very special effort to live as long as Sir Stanley did - which will give him at least another 30 years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>BBC bosses in Scotland were in a celebratory mood last week as they crowed about their coup in winning the live TV rights for the Celtic-Rangers game on Wednesday night. As the game effectively killed off the League Championship they had every right to be happy, as Sky would be left to cover loads of meaningless matches. But the sad fact is that this will be the only live British League game to be shown on the BBC this year and probably the last one ever unless someone stops Sky's backdoor bid to take over football. </p> <p>Last week we saw Sky take a 9.9 per cent stake in Chelsea with little fuss. Even Chelsea's most famous supporter, ex-Sports Minister Tony Banks, seemed to be taken in by Sky's claim that this was good for Chelsea because they would give Vialli an extra \u00a350 million to spend. That's about as likely as Ken Bates winning a good diplomacy award. </p> <p>Having failed to take over Manchester United for a knockdown \u00a3623 million, Sky have moved to take a share in as many big clubs as it will take to win the broadcasting rights. The Premier League's reaction to this has, until the Chelsea deal, been to close their eyes and pretend it's not happening. The current rules of the Premier League allow for any one company to have a stake of up to 9.9 per cent in more than one club. When the rule was drawn up, no one reckoned on Rupert Murdoch's ruthless determination not to lose out on the exclusive rights to live football. </p> <p>The BBC long ago gave up hope of competing for live football and will be left with the crumbs of highlights for the increasingly patronising Match of the Day. Murdoch has left the skirmish with the BBC to his part-owned Talksport Radio and the battleground has been cricket not football. </p> <p>The idea that because Murdoch has been limited to just a 9.9 per cent stake does not necessarily mean that the club will vote for Sky's bid is laughable and an insult to our intelligence. The vote for the rights to Premiership football is already becoming a foregone conclusion and the only man who knew Sky inside out, Sam Chisholm, has been sacked by the Premier League and given a multi-million pound payoff. It's as if the Premier League want to give away the rights for nothing. </p> <p>The Chelsea deal follows similar shareholdings at Manchester United, Manchester City, Leeds and Sunderland. It means that if City are promoted Murdoch will have control of five votes in the crucial TV rights negotiations. You can also add to that the vote of Spurs, who are so certain to support Murdoch that he hasn't even bothered to waste any of his money on buying shares in them - he doesn't need to. It is Spurs chairman Alan Sugar's company, Amstrad, that makes Sky dishes. If anyone has any doubt about which way Tottenham will cast their vote then they should look at the announcement that they made last week on their new internet site. None other than Sky are setting up the new site. So that's six votes guaranteed. </p> <p>The Premier League, having woken up to the dangers of a Murdoch takeover, have now been making very low-key noises about the fact that they may act to change the rules of ownership if Murdoch has a stake in six clubs. The League have finally cottoned on to the fact that a change in rules requires a two-thirds majority and that if Murdoch controlled seven votes he could effectively block any rule change and be free to buy into other clubs. The Premier League are now saying that they will 'draw a line in the sand' at Sky having a stake in six clubs, but if Murdoch buys into just one more club it could be too late. </p> <p>The problem is that the Premier League don't seem to have the will to take Murdoch on. If they won't act then what about the FA? The ownership rule is also an FA rule and the odds are that they are more likely to take action than the Premier League, though that would require real guts from the new FA boss. It is more likely that action will come not from the football authorities but from the Government - after all, they outlawed Murdoch's takeover of Manchester United. The problem is that Tony Blair may not want to upset Murdoch twice and his Sports Minister, Kate Hoey, hasn't the power to act on her own. </p> <p>If someone doesn't act then we are effectively handing over our Premier League to Murdoch. Some people may not care if this happens, but just look what Murdoch has done to rugby league. </p> <p>Charlie Whelan will host Radio 5's 6-0-6 for three weeks from next Saturday</p>",

This was far from vintage United, but a vital result given their decision to rest so many players ahead of Wednesday's Champions League meeting with Fiorentina and the fact that a Yorke hat-trick will renew faith in his goalscoring talents at this, the most vital stage of the season. A game that resounded with importance for both parties did not disappoint in the early, wind-affected going as Malcolm Christie, former United fan and parks footballer par excellence, missed a glorious opportunity to write his name into Derby folklore. Seventeen seconds had gone when Rory Delap's right-wing cross arrived invitingly at the feet of Christie, signed from Nuneaton Borough 17 months ago, six yards from goal. Unfortunately for the former United supporter, Mark Bosnich's reactions were superb. United's response was swift, Gary Neville's wind-assisted cross being misjudged by Delap as Quinton Fortune connected with a shot that flew inches beyond the far post. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, revelling in a precious starting place, slipped away from Steve Elliott and narrowly chipped over the bar before a superb pass from Paul Scholes on the halfway line sent the Norwegian striker scurrying towards goal. Solskjaer looked to be clearly brought down by keeper Mart Poom outside the area but well-positioned referee Jeff Winter instantly disagreed - a non-decision that provoked predictable response. Solskjaer sprinted after Winter while play continued, David Beckham stood on the wing spitting invective at the linesman and Sir Alex Ferguson left his perch in the raised dugout, and the marked managers' touchline area, to similarly harangue the officials.

The goal was probably of more relevance and significance to Yorke himself as Poom kindly gifted him his first domestic goal since Boxing Day. With Solskjaer flavour of the moment and Teddy Sheringham seemingly content with his permanent place on the bench, the competition is currently between Yorke and Andy Cole for the second striker position. The contest became ever more absorbing as Georgi Kinkladze, revered still by half of Manchester, added a few cameo splashes to the Old Trafford canvas, twisting this way and that in an attempt to penetrate a defence that has looked suspect on more than one occasion of late. Unfortunately for the Georgian, Christie had become more interested in a petty feud with Gary Neville, which commenced when he accused the Manchester defender of elbowing him while waiting for a 26th minute throw-in.

      "body": "<p>What do you get for \u00a311million? Not the most devastating debut, it has to be said, for although Emile Heskey was his usual honest self he never threatened a goal against the team he helped bury last week, even though Sunderland were reduced to fielding their second string central defence. </p> <p>But anyone expecting instant fireworks from Liverpool's new striker has not been paying attention to the Heskey career to date. He earned the biggest England rave review since Michael Owen for his performance against Argentina, yet instead of punishing Tranmere in the Worthington Cup final four days, he later managed to be upstaged by his own centre half. Instead, England rival Kevin Phillips of Sunderland had the last laugh with a late penalty equaliser. </p> <p>Manager G\u00e9rard Houllier's decision to start with Heskey, just 24 hours after sealing his move from Leicester, capped a remarkable week for the big striker_ one that started so well with a valedictory contribution in his former club's 5-2 romp against yesterday's opponents last Sunday. </p> <p>The 22-year-old Heskey partnered Erik Meijer in the front line against the Wearsiders while Michael Owen, who played 90 minutes in midweek for the reserves following his hamstring injury, was again nursed back on the bench with Titi Camara. </p> <p>Sunderland began anxious to put their recent poor record behind them. They have not won in nine league games and defensive lapses - witness that collapse at Leicester - have recently cost them dearly. </p> <p>They would have been urged by manager Peter Reid to keep tight at the back and weather any early storm. No doubt they listened but they apparently did not take heed - and Heskey was to the fore as Liverpool grabbed a second-minute lead. </p> <p>He won a penalty after turning quickly in the box and was brought down by Darren Williams after Rigobert Song had played the ball forward. Patrik Berger stepped up and rattled an unstoppable penalty beyond keeper Thomas Sorensen and into the corner of the net. </p> <p>Liverpool, who have conceded only nine goals at home in the Premiership, had their noses in front with the pedigree that suggested they could keep Sunderland in check. Peter Reid's side, indeed, endured a very rocky opening 10-minute period but escaped without further punishment. </p> <p>The Kop had quickly warmed to Heskey and the name Bruno reverberated around the ground. But Sunderland broke away in the 12th minute and Niall Quinn seemed to get a nudge from Stephane Henchoz in the penalty area as he was about to shoot. But referee Graham Poll waved play on. </p> <p>Heskey was seeing plenty of the ball and went on a marvellous run down the right in the 14th minute. He delivered a precise cross into the centre but Meijer's effort went narrowly over the top. </p> <p>Heskey was proving a constant irritation to Sunderland and dragged a shot wide of the post after Meijer had played a cross fromskipper Hyypia back into his path. Hyppia was showing no effects from his recent ankle injury and almost extended their lead in the 27th minute. Berger floated in a corner from the left and Hyypia's header beat keeper Sorensen only to drift wide of the post. </p> <p>Liverpool, stepping up the pace, saw Dietmar Hamann thundere a shot from 25 yards narrowly off target after Heskey steered the ball into his path. Hamann was again out of luck for Liverpool in the 31st minute when another 25-yard thunderbolt was superbly tipped over the top by Sorensen. </p> <p>Sunderland were being restricted to the occasional breakaways and rarely tested keeper Westerveld. Liverpool poured forward in numbers five minutes before the break and their overall confidence was emphasised by Jamie Carragher. He was prepared to test Sorensen from 25 yards out but his effort did not match his optimism. </p> <p>Sunderland were finding it difficult to carve out any real chances, but gave the home supporters a scare in the 58th minute. Republic of Ireland striker Quinn flicked the ball on to Phillips only for his effort to be superbly turned away by keeper Westerveld. </p> <p>Liverpool's Carragher and Sunderland's Paul Thirwell were both booked by referee Poll with the official jumping in to separate the feuding pair. </p> <p>Owen got another run-out when he replaced Meijer in the 73rd minute but four minutes later Sunderland drew level and salvaged a point. </p> <p>Phillips scored his 25th goal of the season from the spot after he had been brought down by the keeper. </p>",

He earned the biggest England rave review since Michael Owen for his performance against Argentina, yet instead of punishing Tranmere in the Worthington Cup final four days, he later managed to be upstaged by his own centre half. Instead, England rival Kevin Phillips of Sunderland had the last laugh with a late penalty equaliser. Manager G\u00e9rard Houllier's decision to start with Heskey, just 24 hours after sealing his move from Leicester, capped a remarkable week for the big striker_ one that started so well with a valedictory contribution in his former club's 5-2 romp against yesterday's opponents last Sunday. The 22-year-old Heskey partnered Erik Meijer in the front line against the Wearsiders while Michael Owen, who played 90 minutes in midweek for the reserves following his hamstring injury, was again nursed back on the bench with Titi Camara. Sunderland began anxious to put their recent poor record behind them. They have not won in nine league games and defensive lapses - witness that collapse at Leicester - have recently cost them dearly. They would have been urged by manager Peter Reid to keep tight at the back and weather any early storm. No doubt they listened but they apparently did not take heed - and Heskey was to the fore as Liverpool grabbed a second-minute lead. He won a penalty after turning quickly in the box and was brought down by Darren Williams after Rigobert Song had played the ball forward. Patrik Berger stepped up and rattled an unstoppable penalty beyond keeper Thomas Sorensen and into the corner of the net. Liverpool, who have conceded only nine goals at home in the Premiership, had their noses in front with the pedigree that suggested they could keep Sunderland in check. Peter Reid's side, indeed, endured a very rocky opening 10-minute period but escaped without further punishment. The Kop had quickly warmed to Heskey and the name Bruno reverberated around the ground. But Sunderland broke away in the 12th minute and Niall Quinn seemed to get a nudge from Stephane Henchoz in the penalty area as he was about to shoot. But referee Graham Poll waved play on. Heskey was seeing plenty of the ball and went on a marvellous run down the right in the 14th minute. He delivered a precise cross into the centre but Meijer's effort went narrowly over the top. Heskey was proving a constant irritation to Sunderland and dragged a shot wide of the post after Meijer had played a cross fromskipper Hyypia back into his path. Hyppia was showing no effects from his recent ankle injury and almost extended their lead in the 27th minute. Berger floated in a corner from the left and Hyypia's header beat keeper Sorensen only to drift wide of the post. Liverpool, stepping up the pace, saw Dietmar Hamann thundere a shot from 25 yards narrowly off target after Heskey steered the ball into his path. Hamann was again out of luck for Liverpool in the 31st minute when another 25-yard thunderbolt was superbly tipped over the top by Sorensen. Sunderland were being restricted to the occasional breakaways and rarely tested keeper Westerveld. Liverpool poured forward in numbers five minutes before the break and their overall confidence was emphasised by Jamie Carragher. He was prepared to test Sorensen from 25 yards out but his effort did not match his optimism. Sunderland were finding it difficult to carve out any real chances, but gave the home supporters a scare in the 58th minute. Republic of Ireland striker Quinn flicked the ball on to Phillips only for his effort to be superbly turned away by keeper Westerveld. Liverpool's Carragher and Sunderland's Paul Thirwell were both booked by referee Poll with the official jumping in to separate the feuding pair. Owen got another run-out when he replaced Meijer in the 73rd minute but four minutes later Sunderland drew level and salvaged a point. Phillips scored his 25th goal of the season from the spot after he had been brought down by the keeper.",

But Wimbledon dominated and they seemed set to take the lead when a Jason Euell flick found Cort, unmarked in the penalty area. England Under-21 forward Cort took a touch too many before shooting and Tim Flowers came off his line to block. Neither side looked that bothered, though, as the game took on the air of a pre-season friendly on a balmy afternoon in south London. And there was only a brief sense of excitement when a 32nd-minute Impey error gave Euell possession and he was bundled to the ground by Gerry Taggart as he tried to get past the Leicester defender. Neal Ardley calmly sent Flowers the wrong way to score with a sidefooted shot from the penalty spot and the Wimbledon sound system blasted out celebratory sounds which were a touch louder than the cheers from the crowd. Leicester suffered a further potential set-back when they lost Robbie Savage through injury, just six minutes into the second half. But they had little cause for concern as Taggart made amends for his penalty error by equalising four minutes later. Guppy's corner was flicked to the far post by Stan Collymore and the unmarked Taggart belted the ball in from close range. Anybody's game now, but, in the next attack, Cort could have shifted the balance Wimbledon's way - and impressed the scout from Leeds United watching him - had he not badly mistimed his jump when presented with a free header on the edge of the six-yard area. No matter, with his late goal he did just that.",

      "body": "<p>There's something special about the idea of a dark, sprawling house in Los Angeles, filled with the ghosts of a glorious past, the sun shining relentless outside, but a firmly shuttered murk within. Think of Sunset Boulevard, or Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. These are the images conjured up by reports of an apparently increasingly reclusive Quentin Tarantino, lurking in his vast house in the Hollywood Hills and battling with script after script that doesn't work. One is about his father, a strikingly personal choice for a man accused of making movies about movies. Tarantino, they say, doesn't leave his grounds much. He doesn't have to: he has his own screening room, with a proper 35mm projector. What more could he need? </p> <p>The question of what has happened to Tarantino started to crop up when lists of the best films of the Nineties appeared at the end of last year. Working on The Observer's Top 10, I was almost surprised when I remembered Tarantino. It is only two years since Jackie Brown was released here, but he seemed to have been gone for much longer. He just disappeared. Not only because he didn't seem to be doing anything, but because no one talked about him any more. </p> <p>Somehow, he had gone from being the biggest thing since the movie brats of the Seventies, to the guy whose last film was the second best Elmore Leonard adaptation of 1998, utterly eclipsed by Steven Soderbergh's Out Of Sight . He wrote the introduction to a book about blaxploitation, he put his name to the re-release of a couple of terrible Seventies films and broke up with Mira Sorvino. </p> <p>The rather romantic vision of Tarantino going mad in his mansion is deflated when you learn the one bit of work he has finished recently is playing a blind preacher in Little Nicky, Adam Sandler's latest. That's right, in two years the most famous director of his generation has done a bit part in an Adam Sandler movie. It starts you thinking: what was all the fuss about in the first place? </p> <p>It was all an accident, anyway. Reservoir Dogs was originally planned as a tiny $35,000 film until Harvey Keitel got involved. You can see that it was designed to be a micro-budget film: most of it takes place in a big bare warehouse, and you never get to see the heist. In the end, it still only cost $1.5 million. But it didn't look cheap, it wasn't arty; it was clever but not weird, clearly aimed at people who never have considered watching a Jim Jarmusch or even David Lynch film. Consciously or not, Tarantino had created a third way between the Hollywood of the high concept Top Gun years and its arthouse polar opposite. </p> <p>Strangely, Reservoir Dogs flopped at the US box office, although it did well here. But it made an impact regardless. The slow-motion walking sequence became instantly famous, as did the ear-slicing scene. The film helped put the Sundance festival on the map. It brought John Woo to the attention of Western audiences. The soundtrack was perfect for a time when exploring record piles in charity shops suddenly seemed like a good idea. And it was a man's film, three years before Loaded and all that followed. Quentin Tarantino was 29. Everything snowballed. Old scripts he had written were dusted down for True Romance, and Natural Born Killers. He directed a quarter of the vilified Four Rooms. His co-writer Roger Avary directed the widely disliked Killing Zoe. Tarantino was invited to inflict his acting on other people's films, and did some dialogue about Silver Surfer comics for Tony Scott's submarine movie Crimson Tide. And when Pulp Fiction emerged, the hype seemed instantly justified. </p> <p>Here's Time magazine at Cannes in 1995: 'Then BLAM!, the Wild Bunch hit town. On the festival's final Saturday, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and other performers from the American thriller Pulp Fiction brought some big-time, macho-and-mayhem, Uzi-in-your-gut star quality to Cannes.' </p> <p>And the Washington Post on the film: 'Pulp Fiction is everything it's said to be: brilliant and brutal, funny and exhilarating, jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet. Quentin Tarantino, the postmodern Boy Wonder of American crass culture, for whom the only thing to fear is boredom itself, has produced a work of mesmerising entertainment.To watch this movie (whose 2 hours speed by unnoticed) is to experience a near-assault of creativity.' </p> <p> Pulp Fiction cost $8m to make. It won the Palme d'Or and made more than $200m. It was hip and mass market. It brought back Travolta and made Jackson a star. Aging surf guitar hero Dick Dale was suddenly playing Europe to big crowds. And Tarantino was on the verge of being the most famous director since Hitchcock. </p> <p> What followed wasn't a spectacular self-destruction; there was no act of ego-driven madness like Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie, or Peter Bogdanovich's At Long Last Love or Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. People just got tired of films in which hitmen talked about old TV shows. From Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead down to 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag, the schtick grew wearier and wearier. Kevin Williamson picked up the postmodern/pop cult riffs and used them for Scream. That has exhausted itself too, as anyone who has had the misfortune of seeing Williamson's directorial debut Teaching Mrs Tingle knows. </p> <p>The gang discussing Madonna over breakfast at the start of Reservoir Dogs had seemed so fresh, but staleness set in alarmingly. I remember seeing Heat and appreciating the lack of ostentatious cleverness in the dialogue. </p> <p>Tarantino's insistence on appearing on screen didn't help either: he's an immensely gifted writer, a pretty fair director and one of the worst actors the world has ever seen. Only a year after the impossible heights of Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, scripted by and starring Tarantino, was described by one critic as 'indefensible trash'. </p> <p>So Tarantino made Jackie Brown: cutting down on the violence, concentrating on a middle-aged love story. And the world shrugged and walked on by. In theory, the film was a step in the right direction, Tarantino's shot at growing up. In practice, nobody cared. Two years on from Jackie Brown, there is no Tarantino-shaped hole at the heart of Hollywood. Guy Ritchie nicked the whole Tarantino bag of tricks for Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, and ended up on Madonna's arm. Others have raced ahead. </p> <p>Some mistook Paul Thomas Anderson for the new Tarantino when Boogie Nights first came out - ah, the Seventies!, they shouted. Burt Reynolds! Tacky songs on the soundtrack! But the scope and depth of Anderson's Magnolia is far beyond anything Tarantino has even hinted at. Tarantino has talked a lot about making a men-on-a-mission movie, his Dirty Dozen. But why wait when you can see Three Kings, which has all the elements you can imagine in Tarantino's film - the deliberate juxtaposition of violence and humour - plus a political complexity that would surely elude Quentin. </p> <p>Why miss him when you can have a hip-hop soundtracked hitman movie paying homage to both Kurosawa and Tarantino's beloved Jean-Pierre Melville like Jim Jarmusch's fabulous Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai , due out here in April? Or a hitman movie that stars Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, exploiting every Sixties resonance they possess, like Soderbergh's The Limey? In fact, the way Soderbergh overcame the albatross of Sex, Lies and Videotape via a retreat into impenetrable artiness to a commercial resurrection as George Clooney's favourite collaborator could be a lesson to Tarantino. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the stalled Tarantino scripts focuses on World War II, written by another burnt-out one-time wonderboy, Peter Bogdanovich. Bogdanovich, like Tarantino, is a feverish film buff, a man who went to Hollywood to worship at the feet of the great directors. Like Tarantino, he's an intensely geeky character who struck gold early: The Last Picture Show was his second movie. Like Tarantino, there was a period when he seemed unable to do any wrong: What's Up Doc? starred Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand and still managed to be a good film. There is one lesson Bogdanovich can give Tarantino: don't grow up to be like me. </p> <p>Whether he has the humility to say it is another matter. There's a strange story that appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer recently. The paper reported that Tarantino has made another film, in secret. It's a nice idea, but an impossible one. Unless, of course, Tarantino has turned the camera on himself, and made a harrowing film about a once dominant director adrift in his vast estate above LA. In which case, he really was smarter than us all along.</p>",

I'm over the moon... Listen to me waffling on...' There is a scene in Holy Smoke, after the film has started to unravel into a splendid derangement, when Kate Winslet stands naked in the Australian scrubland, a great sky behind her, and urinates on to the sand.</p> <p>She wasn't actually urinating, she says; there was a saline drip attached behind her head. But she did insist on trying one take for real. 'And the problem is, of course, that the wee dribbles down one leg.' There is something very Kate Winslet about this scene, and her candid describing of it: there she stands, naked and voluptuous in the bare light, with her soft and even features, her steady gaze, her strong and shapely body, her feet planted very firmly on the ground. Nudity is not an act of narcissism here; she does not become an object modelling for the camera lens, a skinny starved star. Rather, it is as if she is saying: 'Take me as you find me, this is me.' </p> <p>'This is me' is a constant refrain from Kate Winslet. Her conversation - slung about with swear words, breaking down into laughter, interrupted by self-mocking insults ('Listen to me, I sound like a hippy idiot... a wanker...'), continually going off on engaging detours ('Fucking waffle, ah well, that's me') - always comes back to this resolution to remain herself: when she calls a spade a spade (or a 'fucking' spade, more like). When she talks about her period or, now, of course, her morning sickness. When she describes meeting Winona Ryder when her left tit was hanging out, or when she was introduced to Emma Thompson and was exultant because the older, admired actress talked about needing a pee. When she says her idea of romance isn't a sentimental Valentine's Day card but, say, a man she fancies sending her his smelly socks. When she refuses to be a 'stick insect', a 'fucking model' and tucks into chocolate cake with the gusto of an over-excited birthday girl. When she insists on attending the funeral of a beloved friend rather than the premiere of Titanic. When she marries film director Jim Threapleton at a tiny church surrounded by her non-celebrity friends and eats bangers and mash afterwards. And when she becomes pregnant at the age of 24 with no anxieties about interrupting her blossoming, triumphant career because, as she tells me, 'acting for me has always come second'.</p> <p>'This is me,' she insists: not thin, not delicate, not refined, not beautiful (oh but she is, for all her claims of 'my bum's massive, my breasts are saggy, my back's spotty, how can I do this job?'), not spoilt, not in thrall to success and the alluring image up there on the screen; but free, happy, girlish, lucky, in love, and having such fun. This is me, she is saying as she kicks off her shoes and curls up on the sofa and insults herself - this is sane Kate: dottily, recklessly sane, valiantly ordinary, going full tilt for difficult normality. </p> <p>For, of course, Kate Winslet's life so far has not been ordinary at all. She has always known she would be an actress. She grew up in a theatrical family in Reading, the middle one of three sisters, and she remembers the early passion she brought to the role of Mary in her school's Nativity play. She was famous before she reached adulthood. A lot of her growing up was done in the public eye and it is almost as if her outward show of emphatic youthfulness and unworldliness comes from not having had a real girlhood. Her triumphs and her mistakes were seen, discussed, the stuff of gossip columns: that kiss, that comment, that dress, the weight gained or lost under the speculative gaze of the camera.</p> <p>She was only 17 when she starred in Heavenly Creatures, the film based on the true story of two girls who murdered the mother of one of them - a slightly perverse, intense, just short of over-the-top performance that won the admiration of the critics. Since then, she has been in Ang Lee's beautiful version of Sense and Sensibility (Lee called Winslet a bold, raw talent; Winslet fainted on set several times, so immersed was she in the masochistic, intense romanticism of her character, Marianne); in Jude (as Sue Bridehead opposite Christopher Eccleston's moody Jude); as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.</p> <p>She didn't just fall into the parts by luck, she went after them with the determination of a Rottweiler. When she auditioned for Sense and Sensibility, for instance, she was supposed to be reading the minor role of Lucy but thought, 'fuck this'. She went for Marianne instead, sweeping all objections aside. Later, she besieged director James Cameron with her passionate desire to play Rose in Titanic. </p> <p> Titanic was a blockbuster which would have sunk a less buoyant, resolute actress than herself. As Rose, you can sense her fighting her corner in the film, lustrously beautiful and strong and unafraid (distressed by, yet scornful of the critics who called her 'too fleshy'). And so she looked set to become part of the Hollywood machine - another star collecting her millions from the big-budget monsters. She broke free, to the alarm of advisers, turning down scripts from America and choosing instead to star in a modest British film, Hideous Kinky. </p> <p>Now Holy Smoke, Jane Campion's film, is about to be released. Kate Winslet plays Ruth, a young woman who goes to India with a friend and there meets a guru (as Anthony Lane in The New Yorker comments, the movie 'has a strong smell of the 1970s about it'). She is enthralled. 'Something amazing has happened to me,' she says, and refuses to return from Delhi to her suburban home in Sydney. Her mother flies in to rescue her, and eventually lures her back under the pretence that her father is dying. She returns, wearing her Eastern robes and her third eye, to find him playing golf. The family fork out thousands of dollars to hire the 'Number One exit counsellor in America', PJ Waters.</p> <p>Enter Harvey Keitel, and the film becomes a frenetic two-hander between feisty, enlightened, uninhibited, bitchy, enraged, mad, sane Ruth, and shrewd, patronising, sinister, controlling Waters. The duel starts as a discussion about reality and truth, but quickly becomes wilder. Kate steals the show, extraordinary in the power and range of her performance. Jane Campion, when casting Holy Smoke, says that she needed to find an actress who could be equal to Keitel, and with Winslet she more than succeeds. She's a young woman, with a blatantly girlish vocabulary, but as an actress she is remarkably grown-up. </p> <p>The first time I talk to Kate Winslet she is casual, bare-footed and chatty on a sofa in a London hotel at the end of a long day, slugging vodka (this was pre-pregnancy), munching crisps, rolling cigarettes. Conversation with her is rather like a high-spirited pyjama party - ask a question and she charges off, anecdotal, digressional, giggly, complicit, deliberately uncool. She says that the experience of making Holy Smoke was 'fucking unbelievable. When I saw it for the first time, saw what I'd made of Ruth, I thought to myself: \"Oh my God, I've created a bitch; Frankenstein's monster.\" But I loved it; I loved her. Such a fucking little cow - although she was even more vile in the script. I read the script, and I knew I had to give weight to this girl, to justify her and to make her into someone that the audience can understand. I had to be over-the-top and yet put a lid on her and make her believable. I have to say that I could have found the whole thing really hard. Jane Campion is a tough director.' She waves her roll-up in the air, scattering shreds of tobacco, glugs from her chunky tumbler, pushes hair off her face. 'She's gorgeous, wonderful, but bloody hard. She's mad; she's a self-confessed mad person. Plus, she's humane and honest and intuitive, and she pushes her actors, challenges them. She asks us to be as revealing as possible, as open as you can be; to transfer the whole of your self on to the character that you are playing.' </p> <p>With Ruth, Kate Winslet felt that the director 'wanted a clone of a younger version of Jane herself. She kind of embodied this vision she's had. And I knew she had to let go; she wasn't letting go of Ruth and giving her to me. In the end I said: \"I can't do everything you're telling me to do. It's me up there, not you. It's got to be what I want her to do, otherwise I promise you, I'll just give you a crap performance.\" And she was thrilled with that. Thrilled. She thrives on honesty. </p> <p>'After, I gave myself one hundred fucking per cent to the film. I still can't believe what I did. It was a journey. I'm no longer so scared what people think of me. Jane would say: \"Do you think Ruth cares what people think of her?\" \"No, of course not; she is unashamed and won't be judged.\" \"And do you?\" \"No, no, though of course I want people to like me.\" \"Ah, so you do care then.\" It changed me. It opened me up, made me less afraid. If I'm afraid of something, it's like, \"See a mountain, Kate, and you climb it girl, or what's the point?\" To back away from fear is the worst thing you can do. Fear shows.' </p> <p>She was very fearful after Titanic and her hurtle into stardom. 'I never had a plan to be a big star. I wanted to do things that were more \"Kate\". After Titanic - and it was the number one blockbuster, the sums were huge, oh-so-fucking huge, and what the stars were earning was enough to feed all the families in Brixton for the rest of their lives - I lost my intuition. I lost my rhyme and reason. I had a loose hold on things. So much was expected of me. I was terrified people would think I had changed because of it. I remember afterwards when I was walking along a road and I saw this old friend I'd been at school with coming towards me and I was terrified. I panicked. I thought: \"She's going to think I'm different.\" But it was all exactly the same: chat chat chat. And then she said, \"You must have been so scared.\" And I was. I knew I'd be deeply unhappy if I did another film like that. I needed to affirm my faith in myself. It had all been too much. I told myself, \"What you believe in is at stake. Your happiness is at stake.\" I knew that for a fact. If I'd gone to Hollywood, lived there, bought into the system, I'd have been so depressed. I'd have lost myself. I really do have a big problem with the film-star thing. I don't think of me like that and I don't want to. And Jim doesn't think of me like that. He met me before Titanic came out, he hadn't really seen me in anything. He met me. Kate. He loved me for me. Plus, things are only expected of you if you allow them to be. And it's a fight but I am not going to be beaten on this one.' </p> <p>She will not be a star: her schoolgirl language and her contempt for what Hollywood represents is all about asserting the 'real' Kate. 'It always seems unreal to me, pretty unbelievable. I say: \"Kate, how has this happened?\" But it would seem more unreal if I lived in Malibu and had three cars. I saw Leo [Leonardo DiCaprio to us] the other day. I was at a party for Quills [the film about the Marquis de Sade she has recently finished filming]. Me and Jim were leaning up against the bar and this posse of boys came in wearing masks and Halloween gear. I recognised him from the way he walked. He ripped his mask off. He hadn't changed a bit. Of course, he's famous, one of the most famous actors in the world. But he's the same person and I'd been so worried about him. He still does care about everything he does. He hasn't just become some bullshit film star. I hate all of that crap. I won't do it. I still go to a public gym in north London, not some private fucking place. I love it. Families go there for days out. People who've known me all my life say, \"How you doing Kate?\" and I love all of that - normal relationships, normal life. If I'm going to change, my life and experiences should change me for the wiser and more profound.' </p> <p>She is emphatic that her fame has not altered her relationship with her family, and when I suggest it must be hard for her two sisters, who are also actresses and inevitably labouring in her shadows, she simply praises their abilities and tells me how happy she was that she and her elder sister got married within five weeks of each other. Of course, it is easy for her to be generous, harder for them. Easier for her - the deservedly lucky and luminously fair - to talk about luck and unfairness. </p> <p>About her marriage to Jim Threapleton, she is characteristically immoderate. They met while filming Hideous Kinky in Morocco. She says that she took one look at him and 'just knew... I thought fuck fuck fuck.' She wasn't expecting a serious romance. She was recovering from the Titanic experience. Moreover, she had recently attended the funeral of her one-time lover and best friend, Stephen Tredre, who died of the cancer that had been diagnosed shortly after they broke up. She was in Morocco to act and to get a suntan and be carefree at last. But she saw Jim Threapleton and that was it. They married in November 1998, honeymooned in the wilds of Scotland, and spend as much time as possible together in their home in north London. Now she says that 'marriage has made me safer. I have become much less worried about pleasing other people. There is nothing in my life that is more important than my relationship with Jim.' She stops dead and glares wildly. 'Oh fuck, listen to me, I'm trying very hard to make us sound less schmaltzy, slushy. We're just an ordinary couple. We have rows. We're both opinionated. It's not as if we're a domestic, supersonic couple. I don't just cook him meals. We eat...' - she waves her drink in the air - 'takeaways!' </p> <p>Food has become a symbol of the Winslet way. Her bangers-and-mash lifestyle is not a simple matter. Her weight, subject of a great deal of media attention over the years, has also in the past obsessed her. When she was a girl, she was known as 'Blubber'. When she was a teenager, she weighed 13 stone, and was bullied at school. She became anorexic, fasted and binged. When I tell her about a survey I had just seen, showing that the majority of teenage girls, however skinny they are, feel that they are overweight, she opens her mouth, starts to say something, then bursts into tears. 'Awful', she keeps saying. 'Awful.' </p> <p>'I was like that', she says. 'I was like all those girls. Fuck. An unstoppable feeling. I starved myself. So seductive - all my bones sticking out. I was that child, looking at the images of models in films, magazines, fashion shows. This is what girls are brought up to believe, that to be thin is to be loved, adored, perfect. That's how they'll get a boyfriend - by becoming like a stick insect. Look at Marilyn Monroe, though - size 16 and gorgeous. Look at Barbra Streisand, a gorgeous big bum on her. We don't see people like her any more, we just see these perfect thin people. I was huge at 16, I ate like a pig. I was not happy. And when I was thin, I was so boring about food; all I could think about was what I'd eaten. I wasn't happy then either. I don't believe in diets. It's about how you are in yourself. I hate the way all this has fucked up young girls. When there was all that press comment about my weight after Titanic, I wasn't angry so much as disappointed. I was so disappointed. But then I thought, \"Well, fuck you, I'm the youngest person to be nominated for the Academy Awards, and that wasn't for being a skeleton.\" And I thought I had a way of helping people here, by not getting sucked in to that again. I'll not do that. I've had lots of letters from mothers who have anorexic daughters, thanking me for the things I've said. That's gratifying.' </p> <p>Kate Winslet is not a simple woman - the unthreatening and garrulous 'our Kate', who wears Gap jumpers and swears like a teenage trooper. She's determinedly simple, but it's against the odds - a wilful, complicated kind of naturalness. After the news of her pregnancy, when I talked to Kate Winslet again, she said that her habit of speaking her mind and being open was not a strategy, but it was certainly a decision she had made: her way of surviving. 'I have always been myself. In the early days of Heavenly Creatures and Sense and Sensibility, I was myself, but trying to sound really intelligent and alert, as if I understood Shakespeare and Jane Austen, when I mean, fuck it, I'd hardly even heard of Jane Austen. I was trying to be terribly grown-up and yet a real girl - it was an odd mixture and I think it exhausted me. Since then, and especially since meeting Jim, I feel I am brave enough to be me. He allows me to be me. I have confidence in myself in a way that I didn't before. Being open, vulnerable, well it is not a tactic but I would say that I have been stung sometimes, and I'd also say it's something I will not be beaten on. I will not be changed because of what some stupid newspaper wants to say. I don't read stuff about me, but I did see a little thing about me in Hello! recently, and it described how Jim had proposed to me by going down on one knee. Crap. He didn't. But I'm never going to tell anyone how it happened, because that's between us and nobody else. So maybe I've learnt how to be less open. To protect what is precious.' </p> <p>She is reluctant to speak too much about her pregnancy - she is not yet past the crucial first trimester, and feels 'superstitious' about making plans. She will say that she has been feeling 'very very sick'. They confirmed she was pregnant on Valentine's Day; and yes, they had planned it ('Well, at least we hadn't been not trying...'). 'We knew it would cause all kind of work hiccups - although actually as it turns out, everything has worked out very well.' Therese Raquin (a film she will produce) has been postponed until next year, but that's 'a blessing in disguise, because it means that one of the actors we really want will be available'. Anyway, she feels 'no fear' about her career. 'I've never been one for changing what is real in order to make my career buzz. My career comes second. I love it, but if I'm not working all the time I am happy. There are some actors who do back-to-back jobs and are anxious when others are in the limelight. That's not me. So I'm just happy, excited. But we're going to take it as it comes. We just want to apply the fun we have together and apply it to our baby.' </p> <p>'I go hook, line and sinker' for things, says Kate Winslet. For relationships, in work. She tells me that when she takes a role, the first thing that she does is ask that new character the Proust Questionnaire, so she can 'find out how the character will respond to things; it gets you right in there; all the way in'. So before we finish, I ask her a few of the questions on the questionnaire: </p> <p>What are you most scared of? 'Oh, not many things you know. Let's think. Well, until I went on holiday recently I had a real fear of being in deep water. Of what was below the surface. I'd always have to turn round and go back. So I learnt to scuba dive - I have to face my fears - and now I feel fine and in control down there. I'm still scared of being on the surface, with all the depth under me. It's like a thin-ice thing I suppose.' </p> <p>What is the trait you most dislike in your self? 'There should be lots of things. God, tricky. I think I do have a tendency to come up with lots of ideas about life and plans - wouldn't it be great if... - and then I don't get round to doing them. They're sometimes such good ideas too, I think: \"God, you're clever to think of that.\" A procrastinator when it comes to life, though not with work.' </p> <p>And the trait you most like in yourself? She replies at once: 'I am a good listener. I do listen to people and hear their problems, when friends have their knickers in a twist...' What is your idea of heaven? 'Probably something really basic. I know - breakfast in bed, after a really long lie-in. Oh God, I love it all. Croissants and toast and scrambled eggs, I adore scrambled eggs.' </p> <p>And favourite smell? 'I have to say it is when I'm in the countryside and there's been rain, a storm. And the grass and earth smell so fresh, that's it, and now I sound like a hippy idiot again.' Later that evening she rings me to say that she knows what her really really favourite smell is: the smell of wood smoke. 'I don't know why, but it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel young again. It makes me feel happy.' </p> <p> Holy Smoke is on general release from 31 March</p>",

I remember afterwards when I was walking along a road and I saw this old friend I'd been at school with coming towards me and I was terrified. I panicked. I thought: \"She's going to think I'm different.\" But it was all exactly the same: chat chat chat. And then she said, \"You must have been so scared.\" And I was. I knew I'd be deeply unhappy if I did another film like that. I needed to affirm my faith in myself. It had all been too much. I told myself, \"What you believe in is at stake. Your happiness is at stake.\" I knew that for a fact. If I'd gone to Hollywood, lived there, bought into the system, I'd have been so depressed. I'd have lost myself. I really do have a big problem with the film-star thing. I don't think of me like that and I don't want to. And Jim doesn't think of me like that. He met me before Titanic came out, he hadn't really seen me in anything. He met me. Kate. He loved me for me. Plus, things are only expected of you if you allow them to be. And it's a fight but I am not going to be beaten on this one.' She will not be a star: her schoolgirl language and her contempt for what Hollywood represents is all about asserting the 'real' Kate. 'It always seems unreal to me, pretty unbelievable. I say: \"Kate, how has this happened?\" But it would seem more unreal if I lived in Malibu and had three cars. I saw Leo [Leonardo DiCaprio to us] the other day. I was at a party for Quills [the film about the Marquis de Sade she has recently finished filming]. Me and Jim were leaning up against the bar and this posse of boys came in wearing masks and Halloween gear. I recognised him from the way he walked. He ripped his mask off. He hadn't changed a bit. Of course, he's famous, one of the most famous actors in the world. But he's the same person and I'd been so worried about him. He still does care about everything he does. He hasn't just become some bullshit film star. I hate all of that crap. I won't do it. I still go to a public gym in north London, not some private fucking place. I love it. Families go there for days out. People who've known me all my life say, \"How you doing Kate?\" and I love all of that - normal relationships, normal life. If I'm going to change, my life and experiences should change me for the wiser and more profound.' She is emphatic that her fame has not altered her relationship with her family, and when I suggest it must be hard for her two sisters, who are also actresses and inevitably labouring in her shadows, she simply praises their abilities and tells me how happy she was that she and her elder sister got married within five weeks of each other. Of course, it is easy for her to be generous, harder for them. Easier for her - the deservedly lucky and luminously fair - to talk about luck and unfairness. About her marriage to Jim Threapleton, she is characteristically immoderate. They met while filming Hideous Kinky in Morocco. She says that she took one look at him and 'just knew... I thought fuck fuck fuck.' She wasn't expecting a serious romance. She was recovering from the Titanic experience. Moreover, she had recently attended the funeral of her one-time lover and best friend, Stephen Tredre, who died of the cancer that had been diagnosed shortly after they broke up. She was in Morocco to act and to get a suntan and be carefree at last. But she saw Jim Threapleton and that was it. They married in November 1998, honeymooned in the wilds of Scotland, and spend as much time as possible together in their home in north London. Now she says that 'marriage has made me safer. I have become much less worried about pleasing other people. There is nothing in my life that is more important than my relationship with Jim.' She stops dead and glares wildly. 'Oh fuck, listen to me, I'm trying very hard to make us sound less schmaltzy, slushy. We're just an ordinary couple. We have rows. We're both opinionated. It's not as if we're a domestic, supersonic couple. I don't just cook him meals. We eat...' - she waves her drink in the air - 'takeaways!' Food has become a symbol of the Winslet way. Her bangers-and-mash lifestyle is not a simple matter. Her weight, subject of a great deal of media attention over the years, has also in the past obsessed her. When she was a girl, she was known as 'Blubber'. When she was a teenager, she weighed 13 stone, and was bullied at school. She became anorexic, fasted and binged. When I tell her about a survey I had just seen, showing that the majority of teenage girls, however skinny they are, feel that they are overweight, she opens her mouth, starts to say something, then bursts into tears. 'Awful', she keeps saying. 'Awful.' 'I was like that', she says. 'I was like all those girls. Fuck. An unstoppable feeling. I starved myself. So seductive - all my bones sticking out. I was that child, looking at the images of models in films, magazines, fashion shows. This is what girls are brought up to believe, that to be thin is to be loved, adored, perfect. That's how they'll get a boyfriend - by becoming like a stick insect. Look at Marilyn Monroe, though - size 16 and gorgeous. Look at Barbra Streisand, a gorgeous big bum on her. We don't see people like her any more, we just see these perfect thin people. I was huge at 16, I ate like a pig. I was not happy. And when I was thin, I was so boring about food; all I could think about was what I'd eaten. I wasn't happy then either. I don't believe in diets. It's about how you are in yourself. I hate the way all this has fucked up young girls. When there was all that press comment about my weight after Titanic, I wasn't angry so much as disappointed. I was so disappointed. But then I thought, \"Well, fuck you, I'm the youngest person to be nominated for the Academy Awards, and that wasn't for being a skeleton.\" And I thought I had a way of helping people here, by not getting sucked in to that again. I'll not do that. I've had lots of letters from mothers who have anorexic daughters, thanking me for the things I've said. That's gratifying.' Kate Winslet is not a simple woman - the unthreatening and garrulous 'our Kate', who wears Gap jumpers and swears like a teenage trooper. She's determinedly simple, but it's against the odds - a wilful, complicated kind of naturalness. After the news of her pregnancy, when I talked to Kate Winslet again, she said that her habit of speaking her mind and being open was not a strategy, but it was certainly a decision she had made: her way of surviving. 'I have always been myself. In the early days of Heavenly Creatures and Sense and Sensibility, I was myself, but trying to sound really intelligent and alert, as if I understood Shakespeare and Jane Austen, when I mean, fuck it, I'd hardly even heard of Jane Austen. I was trying to be terribly grown-up and yet a real girl - it was an odd mixture and I think it exhausted me. Since then, and especially since meeting Jim, I feel I am brave enough to be me. He allows me to be me. I have confidence in myself in a way that I didn't before. Being open, vulnerable, well it is not a tactic but I would say that I have been stung sometimes, and I'd also say it's something I will not be beaten on. I will not be changed because of what some stupid newspaper wants to say. I don't read stuff about me, but I did see a little thing about me in Hello! recently, and it described how Jim had proposed to me by going down on one knee. Crap. He didn't. But I'm never going to tell anyone how it happened, because that's between us and nobody else. So maybe I've learnt how to be less open. To protect what is precious.' She is reluctant to speak too much about her pregnancy - she is not yet past the crucial first trimester, and feels 'superstitious' about making plans. She will say that she has been feeling 'very very sick'. They confirmed she was pregnant on Valentine's Day; and yes, they had planned it ('Well, at least we hadn't been not trying...'). 'We knew it would cause all kind of work hiccups - although actually as it turns out, everything has worked out very well.' Therese Raquin (a film she will produce) has been postponed until next year, but that's 'a blessing in disguise, because it means that one of the actors we really want will be available'. Anyway, she feels 'no fear' about her career. 'I've never been one for changing what is real in order to make my career buzz. My career comes second. I love it, but if I'm not working all the time I am happy. There are some actors who do back-to-back jobs and are anxious when others are in the limelight. That's not me. So I'm just happy, excited. But we're going to take it as it comes. We just want to apply the fun we have together and apply it to our baby.' 'I go hook, line and sinker' for things, says Kate Winslet. For relationships, in work. She tells me that when she takes a role, the first thing that she does is ask that new character the Proust Questionnaire, so she can 'find out how the character will respond to things; it gets you right in there; all the way in'. So before we finish, I ask her a few of the questions on the questionnaire: What are you most scared of? 'Oh, not many things you know. Let's think. Well, until I went on holiday recently I had a real fear of being in deep water. Of what was below the surface. I'd always have to turn round and go back. So I learnt to scuba dive - I have to face my fears - and now I feel fine and in control down there. I'm still scared of being on the surface, with all the depth under me. It's like a thin-ice thing I suppose.' What is the trait you most dislike in your self? 'There should be lots of things. God, tricky. I think I do have a tendency to come up with lots of ideas about life and plans - wouldn't it be great if... - and then I don't get round to doing them. They're sometimes such good ideas too, I think: \"God, you're clever to think of that.\" A procrastinator when it comes to life, though not with work.' And the trait you most like in yourself? She replies at once: 'I am a good listener. I do listen to people and hear their problems, when friends have their knickers in a twist...' What is your idea of heaven? 'Probably something really basic. I know - breakfast in bed, after a really long lie-in. Oh God, I love it all. Croissants and toast and scrambled eggs, I adore scrambled eggs.' And favourite smell? 'I have to say it is when I'm in the countryside and there's been rain, a storm. And the grass and earth smell so fresh, that's it, and now I sound like a hippy idiot again.' Later that evening she rings me to say that she knows what her really really favourite smell is: the smell of wood smoke. 'I don't know why, but it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel young again. It makes me feel happy.' Holy Smoke is on general release from 31 March",

For more than 50 years British war veterans have made an annual pilgrimage to the site, a mile out of Brighton, but the 30ft memorial now seems condemned to fall into ruin. This year, amid accusations of racism and small-mindedness, the veterans have called a halt, saying members are too old to trek across the field that separates the Chattri memorial from the road. The Royal British Legion has organised the service, on the last Sunday in June, since 1943. Local and national dignitaries are invited and the Undivided Indian Ex-Services Association busses in veterans from around the country. The legion decided to end the event without consulting Asian veterans or community groups, provoking anger from families whose fathers and grandfathers sacrificed their lives for a nation they believe is now forgetting them. The Chattri was built in 1921 and unveiled by the then Prince of Wales. Two slabs of granite below its steps cover the concrete where up to 20 Sikh and Hindu soldiers were burnt on funeral pyres. One was the father of 89-year-old Colonel Assa Singh, a Second World War British Army veteran who has attended the ceremony every year since 1943. Deeply upset that it is to be abandoned, he said that to forget Chattri would be to forget the men who gave their lives. Indian soldiers wounded in France were brought to Brighton and taken to a hospital set up at the King's request at the Royal Pavilion. Muslims who died were taken to Woking for burial, and Sikhs and Hindus were cre mated in the Sussex countryside. The ending of the Chattri service is seen as another blow to a community that feels ignored by history. 'It is straightforward racism,' said Santush Kanwar of the Undivided Indian Ex-Services Association. 'There was always a fuss over whether we should bring so many people. The British Legion would be fussing about how they were going to make us all tea. For goodness sake, it wasn't about tea!' The father and grandfather of Harmander Singh, an adviser to the British Asian Volunteer Action group, fought in the British Army in two world wars but as Commonwealth soldiers their war pensions were well below that of a white British soldier. 'Future generations need to be proud to be British and to know our ancestors gave up their lives for this country. This memorial may seem insignificant but it is very important.' Many local Asians resent the fact that it may now fall to them to look after Chattri. Singh said one woman had told him: 'We have already given our lives, why should we dip into our pockets too.' Imam Sajid, secretary of the Brighton Ethnic Minorities Representative Council, added: 'If the British Legion cannot organise it, then they should have talked to us.' Derek Bollom, branch secretary of the British Legion at Patcham, was surprised by the outrage. 'We decided not to do it this year because it is just too difficult to maintain, what with trying to organise the tea afterwards.' 'It's not that we want to forget them. We're getting old, our membership is shrinking.' tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For a long time, Denzel Washington made a career out of suffusing old-school white liberal movies with a dizzying rush of flesh and blood. Take the well-meaning Cry Freedom in 1987 in which he plays Steve Biko - and for which he won his first Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. The film dealt with the burden that poor newspaperman Donald Woods suffered as a result of living in racist South Africa. </p> <p>Washington's intellectually restless Biko is in the movie for only a few scenes, but so dominates the film that he provides a kind of climax. He brings so much heat in his limited screen time that the struggle of the Woods family to escape the country is trivialised. Instead, Freedom dissolves into an act of racial cowardice because no movie studio in the Eighties would have made a film about Biko. The film is the equivalent of paying survivor's benefits to someone who has witnessed an accident. </p> <p>Washington has been compared with Sidney Poitier, and the two men share a lionhearted pride, a stubbornness fuelled by a core of anger. That elegant distance that Poitier was so often applauded for masked a furnace of rage; many of his performances were marked by what he did not dare say, but every black American in the audience felt. Washington is his heir and he gets to mouth the sentiments that Poitier would never utter. He was born and raised the son of a Pentecostal minister in Mount Vernon, New York state, and the flame of the true believer burns in his eyes. </p> <p>Remember that Washington made a huge impact in the Eighties, when studios were more comfortable making films based on old TV shows than they were making movies featuring African American actors. Until Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It, which showed America something as alien as Martians - thriving middle-class black characters without prison records or white friends to lend them validity - there was believed to be no market for films with black actors. </p> <p>Before then, Washington did his best to prop up bad movies. Already, in his first movie, Carbon Copy (1981), a deadheaded attempt at social comedy, Washington was making great use of his agile reflexes. He is the illegitimate son of a Beverly Hills businessman played by George Segal and the whole movie turns on Washington's sudden appearance ruining Segal's life. </p> <p>As this unwieldy monster grinds to a close, and even the extras seem to be checking their watches to see if they have qualified for overtime, Washington has to deliver one of those payback-is-a-dog speeches. For a moment, his phenomenal ease disappears and undeniable sparks of anger smoulder in his eyes. Suddenly, this well-meaning fraud of a movie, with its narcoleptic timing, comes into focus. Audiences - that is, the nine people outside the cast and crew who sat through Carbon Copy - must have sat there, blinking away the intrusion of recognisable human feeling. </p> <p>He survived Carbon Copy because he worked at his craft. He was simultaneously appearing on stage in A Soldier's Play, which later became the feature film A Soldier's Story. And the anger that kept Poitier so forceful and upright gave Washington an athletic fluidity. During the Eighties, he was a regular on the St Elsewhere TV hospital drama, another display of self-congratulatory liberalism, quietly doing his work. Washington eventually slipped smoothly out of St Elsewhere as he continued to build a movie career, propping up films such as Power. And black audiences were not waiting for People magazine to tell them that Washington was worth his weight in celluloid. They kept an eye on him and his progress. (Though frankly, if African-Americans had to twiddle their thumbs while hoping the mainstream press would validate its de facto underground popular culture, the world would still be waiting for the arrival of rap, artist Jacob Lawrence and Aretha Franklin.) </p> <p>It was Glory (1989), the story of one of the black regiments that fought the confederacy during the American Civil War, that served as his breakthrough and made mainstream audiences take notice. He plays, anachronistically, the insolent slave Trip. In the scene that probably clinched his Oscar for best supporting actor, Trip shrugs off his shirt and pivots his torso, awaiting a whipping so photogenic that you wonder if Helmut Newton was a consultant on the picture. </p> <p>He also showed notable presence in films such as Mississippi Masala (1990) and finally got to play a raffish leading man in Spike Lee's Mo' Better Blues (1990), their first collaboration. Glory was part of the collection of films depicting the black experience to which Washington seems honour-bound to commit himself. </p> <p>As is The Hurricane, the biopic of the life of boxer and convict Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter that may end up as being as controversial as Carter's real-life exploits. (Articles have appeared questioning the veracity of the film, as if people turn to the movies for education. Isn't that why God made tabloid news magazine shows?) Washington's Rubin Carter sizes up every opportunity as it appears, deciding on his level of involvement. When Lesra, the kid who will eventually lead the charge to free him, turns up at the penitentiary to visit, Carter's gaze is quick and cold. He immediately picks over Lesra's psyche as the boy sits in front of him and sees no reason in continuing this relationship. Carter's face is a mask of dissatisfaction and frustration, even when 'Hurricane' flashes back to his day as a murderous boxer who revels in his physical arrogance. </p> <p>His rolling shoulders hang back, and he sidles into frame - at this point in his life, looking for a fight and taking the ones he can find in the ring. </p> <p> This may be the first time that Washington has had a physical relief for his volatility and he charges into the fight sequences with relish. They're swift, merciless beatings; the drama is in seeing Carter's utter enjoyment in rushing an opponent. </p> <p>His effort in The Hurricane will probably win Washington the Academy Award. It's a wonder, but not nearly as prodigious as his Malcolm X , also directed by Lee - perhaps the best performance of the Nineties. </p> <p>His evolution from dissolute to resolute, from convict to conviction is magnificent. He is peerless at exhibiting confidence, but the doubt in his eyes - a wrenching helplessness - is a facet of his talent he rarely gets to use. </p> <p>In the prison scenes when he's reaching out for spiritual completion, he brings to mind the title of the Malcolm X script that James Baldwin wrote: 'One Day when I was Lost'. </p> <p>This element is an important aspect of another of his best, and little seen, leads: Devil in a Blue Dress. It is one of the few times that Washington seems to be in the movie with other people - this time he is not separated by the effort of keeping the picture afloat. Director Carl Franklin's adaptation of Afro-noir novelist Walter Mosley's first Easy Rawlins book teems with not just life, but ambience, and Washington is central to the conception. He has eye contact with the other characters, and is totally involved in the tense desperation that would send a black man dwelling in deeply segregated, and dangerous, Forties Los Angeles into taking on seamy private eye work. Washington's love scene with a way-too-willing friend (the astonishingly voluptuous Lisa Nicole Carson) is sexy and hilarious. </p> <p>Maybe the seediness of the setting, and an ad campaign that made the picture look like a lame piece of nostalgia frozen in Jurassic Park amber, scared audiences away. No one went, and they also stayed away from that sad period when Washington tried to pick up some of that easy action-hero money laying around, starring in several overheated but turgid manly-man films. </p> <p>Washington sliced his way through the film business's institutional indifference to blacks during a forgettable decade of film, and almost single-handedly revived the black matinee idol/ideal, a title that had been retired since Billy Dee Williams saw leading man roles wither and had to turn to selling malt liquor on American TV. They don't give awards for that, but someone should. </p> <p><strong>Washington heights</strong></p> <p><strong> Malcom X </strong>(Spike Lee, 1992) <br> Denzel Washington gives a magnetic performance as the controversial black leader in Lee's epic biopic, equally compelling as the young dissolute and the forceful orator of later years. </p> <p> <strong>Philadelphia</strong> (Jonathan Demme, 1993) <br> Although Tom Hanks won the Oscar, Washington was lauded for his sensitive performance as the homophobic lawyer who struggles to address his own prejudice. </p> <p> <strong>Devil in a Blue Dress </strong> (Carl Franklin, 1995) <br> He plays the reluctant private eye in this intelligent adaptation of Walter Mosley's crime novel, which discovers that postwar racism holds the key to a murder mystery. </p> <p> <strong>The Hurricane </strong> (Norman Jewison, 1999) <br> A powerful portrait of boxer Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter who was falsely jailed for murder.

      "body": "<p>In a recent poll of 59 movie journalists held by Village Voice, New York's alternative weekly, Being John Malkovich topped the list of best films of 1999. Mainstream approval has come with three Oscar nominations - for director Spike Jonze, writer Charlie Kaufman for his original screenplay, and supporting actress Catherine Keener. Despite a disappointing take at the US box office, it was unequivocally the last must-see movie of the Nineties. </p> <p>Audiences in the American heartland like their movies served up straight and the word of mouth around Jonze's movie must have been that it was baffling. There's no disputing the fact that there hadn't been such a subversive US comedy since the heyday of the Marx Brothers. Or one as downright peculiar in its casual surrealism. </p> <p>The story is about an impecunious street puppeteer, Craig (John Cusack), whose wife Lotte (an unrecognisably dowdy Cameron Diaz) urges him to get a job. Taking a position with a corporation on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office block where the ceilings are so low that the employees must stoop like so many Grouchos, Craig falls in love with his bitchy colleague Maxine (Keener). </p> <p>He also discovers a hidden door with a chute that sucks him directly into the head of John Malkovich, the actor, who plays himself, or, at least, a very funny, posturing caricature of himself as a pretentious aesthete, snob and seducer, with an exquisite taste in bathroom towels. Once inside, Craig sees and experiences Malkovich's world from his perspective for 15 minutes before he is expelled on to a piece of wasteland by the New Jersey Turnpike. </p> <p>When Craig introduces Lotte to the experience, she becomes hooked on it and herself falls in love with Maxine. Soon, Craig and Maxine are selling journeys into Malkovich's head like illicit fairground rides, the most bizarre of them taken by Malkovich himself when he finds out what's going on and angrily enters the portal to his own mind. In the movie's most wonderfully unpleasant sequence, we're given a quick tour of Malkovich's unconscious, where he is exposed to a humiliating Oedipal memory or fantasy and where lurk such guilty secrets as the actor's other career as a panty-sniffer. </p> <p>While there's little doubt that Being Nicole Kidman , say, or Being Hugh Grant could have been a box-office titan, it's unlikely that either subject would have encouraged Jonze and Kaufman, who wrote the original script five years ago, to present such a mean portrait - 'the meaner the better,' Malkovich told them - or one so lacking in movie-star spin. </p> <p>The most ironic joke that Being John Malkovich plays on the audience is that we leave the movie unedified by any new insights into the man. 'Spike was more interested in depicting the public's perception of him than in showing who he actually is,' Kaufman has said. The shy, apparently ego-less Jonze, who recently married Sofia Coppola, was born Adam Spiegel in 1969 and raised in Bethesda, Maryland. His initial interests were in the BMX and skateboard cultures. He came to film-making via magazine photography and his direction of inventive pop videos for Bj\u00f6rk, Fatboy Slim, and R.E.M. among others. </p> <p>It was R.E.M. leader Michael Stipe's production company that optioned TV writer Kaufman's screenplay and arranged the financing for the film. In interviews, neither Jonze nor Kaufman make any intellectual claims for Being John Malkovich or cite any particular influences. They may not be telling, of course, but their mordant metamovie seems to be as much a mystery to them as it does to the great American public. </p> <p>The movie's knock-on effects have yet to be seen in Hollywood, whose future will, to a large extent, be determined by such phenomena as the Internet, digital video and virtual reality, as well as the roles to be played by movie stars in those media. </p> <p> Being John Malkovich may prove to be a one-off or a harbinger of new forms of interactivity. As one of those comedies that makes a difference, its place in film history seems assured. What follows is a list of nine other comedies that shook the world, although to the extent to which they actually did is moot. </p> <p>That my list includes no Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Jacques Tati, Billy Wilder, Frank Tashlin, Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks or Carry On s should make clear that this is not intended as a 'greatest' list. </p> <p> <strong> DUCK SOUP</strong> (Leo McCarey, 1933 ) </p> <p>The Marx Brothers are at their most destructively anarchic in this demented anti-authoritarian saga in which Groucho invokes war between two rival Ruritanian nations. It remains the pinnacle of surrealist comedy in American cinema. </p> <p><strong> IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT</strong> (Frank Capra, 1934) </p> <p>Clark Gable took his shirt off, Claudette Colbert showed a leg and Columbia Pictures became a major studio. The first film to win the top five Oscars, Capra's masterpiece ushered in screwball comedy as a much needed cultural salve during the Depression. </p> <p><strong> PINK FLAMINGOS</strong> (John Waters, 1972) </p> <p>Apparently frivolous, definitely foul, Waters's ultra-camp, post-Warholian immersion in disgust, which stars the glorious transvestite star Divine, was a pointed De Sadean antidote to the self-importance that was creeping into American movies at the time. </p> <p><strong> ANNIE HALL</strong> (Woody Allen, 1977) </p> <p>Allen's masterpiece, a nostalgic homage to his relationship with Diane Keaton, remains not only his most beloved film but his funniest and least cynical appraisal of neurotic pontificating intellectuals most perfectly espoused by Keaton and Woody himself. It may not have shaken the entire world, but it certainly held a mirror up to several million New Yorkers. </p> <p><strong> MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN</strong> (Terry Jones, 1979) </p> <p>The Pythons' extremely rude satire of organised religion incurred the wrath of the church, paving the way for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and Kevin Smith's recent Dogma. Naughtiest scene: Eric Idle leading the crucified in 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life'. </p> <p><strong> CROCODILE DUNDEE </strong> (Peter Faiman, 1986) </p> <p>Although there was nothing remotely subversive in its content, beyond some gentle poking at uptight metropolitan types and New York social mores by Paul Hogan's uncouth and thoroughly charming Aussie hero, Crocodile Dundee was an out-of-the-blue, worldwide box-office phenomenon that couldn't be (and hasn't been) repeated. It's proof that a winning comic formula can't be bottled. </p> <p><strong> FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL</strong> (Mike Newell, 1994) </p> <p>The most successful British film of all time was the acme of polite, middle-class feelgood entertainment and singlehandedly made polite, middle-class Hugh Grant a star. Bland? Well, at times, but it also traded in the kind of emotional truthfulness that identikit American romantic comedies frequently omit. The grittier and more socially alert The Full Monty , directed by Peter Cattaneo, did it again for British comedy four years later. </p> <p><strong> LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL</strong> (Roberto Benigni, 1997) </p> <p>Benigni's Holocaust comedy, a contradiction in terms if ever there was one, met with mostly glowing accolades and the director-writer-star's winning personality made him the star of Oscar night 1999. There was a backlash of critical opinion, but the suggestion that this tale was a massive error of taste never gained favour. </p> <p><strong> THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY</strong> (Peter and Bobby Farrelly, 1998) </p> <p>More bad taste, but so acceptable that the Farrelly Brothers' triangle comedy caper became the surprise smash of the summer in which it was released. The scene in which Cameron Diaz innocently rubs Ben Stiller's ejaculate into her hair is a classic. </p> <p>\u0095 Being John Malkovich is released on Friday </p> <p><strong>Philip French's top 10 seminal comedies</strong></p> <p>1.<strong> THE CURE</strong> (Charlie Chaplin, 1917) Chaplin went in three years from nonentity to the most famous man who ever lived, changing the world's notion of celebrity and identity. A transfixed Nijinsky watched him shoot The Cure and proclaimed him 'balletique'. </p> <p>2. <strong> THE GENERAL</strong> (Buster Keaton, 1926) Keaton stunned audiences with an epic comedy scrupulous in its historical detail and on a scale to rival Birth of a Nation. </p> <p>3. <strong> MONKEY BUSINESS</strong> (Norman McLeod,1931) In their first Hollywood film (co-scripted by S.J. Perelman) the Marx Brothers brought an anarchic, surreal, freewheeling humour to the screen unprecedented in its day. </p> <p>4. <strong> THE GREAT DICTATOR</strong> (Charlie Chaplin, 1940) Satirising and preaching in 'premature anti-fascist' mode, Chaplin launched an attack on the Hitler gang and anti-Semitism from a neutral country. His concentration camp number was used by Benigni in Life is Beautiful. </p> <p>5. <strong> HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO </strong> (Preston Sturges, 1944) At the height of World War II Sturges challenged conventional ideas of heroism and hero worship. </p> <p>6. <strong> KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS </strong> (Robert Hamer, 1949) Ealing comedies explored the dark underside of postwar Britain, and this one revelled in homicidal impulses encouraged by the class system. </p> <p>7. <strong> SOME LIKE IT HOT </strong> (Billy Wilder, 1959) Two leading actors in drag, one feigning impotence, the other experiencing gender doubts, made audiences re-think sexual matters at a time when movies were still severely censored. </p> <p>8.<strong> LA CAGE AUX FOLLES</strong> (Eduard Molinaro, 1978) In its time the most popular foreign language film in the US, it presented a long-term homosexual partnership as a conventional marriage. </p> <p>9. <strong> HAPPINESS </strong> (Todd Solondz, 1998) American comedies about dysfunctional middle-class families were all the rage in the Nineties.

The secondees are treated as civil servants and, whenever there is a potential conflict of interest, they are removed from any decision-making.'",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer: </strong> What is Emotionally Weird about? </p> <p> <strong> Kate Atkinson:</strong> I don't know. I suppose it's about words and language and writing. That's such a nebulous topic, but when I was writing Human Croquet I would tell everyone it was about trees and they would say, \"About trees - oh God help us.\" A novel about words sounds even worse. I wanted the readers to feel that they had no idea what was going to happen because I had no idea what was going to happen. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Did you find it difficult to write ? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> It was quite difficult getting the hang of the tone. I also started to write it too soon, so I threw away a lot of stuff. I couldn't hit the stride of how it was supposed to feel or sound in my head. I felt very frustrated at the beginning. But that trilogy is finished now - the trilogy being the first three books. I realised they are based on Alice in Wonderland in one way or another - but the young girl has now reached 21 and is grown up. I've had enough of that kind of writing. I need to move on to the third person. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What made you choose Dundee University as the setting for Emotionally Weird ? </p> <p> <strong> KA: </strong> Behind the Scenes was set in York in the time of my childhood, so that was fascinating and cathartic as I used to feel very homesick. But so many people thought it was autobiographical. The second book I wanted to be about the imagination, but it was a strain to make up a location. With this book I thought, OK, we'll go back to the other way and set it somewhere I know. The next book will be set in a real place where I've rented a house for six months, so people can't say I lived there and say it's autobiographical. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Does it bother you that people ask if your stories are autobiographical? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> Yes. Because I write fiction, I don't write autobiography, and to me they are very different things. The first-person narrative is a very intimate thing, but you are not addressing other people as 'I' - you are inhabiting that 'I'. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you draw your characters from people you know? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> I can think of a few characters in this book that had a real basis, but in the end there is only a trace element. Effie is completely made up and so is Nora, but Bob is so many male students I know all rolled into one. Everybody has been out with Bob. </p> <p>There are hundreds of people who will think they are in this book but they are not. I did know a baby at university called Proteus, but in a way Proteus was my first daughter because I had her when I was doing my doctorate and I would lug her around with me. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Were you wholeheartedly involved in university life, the direct action and the drug-taking? </p> <p> <strong> KA: </strong> I think everyone was, even people who were quite straight. The big political things that happened had finished, although the students hadn't realised it. I remember one sit-in. But it was very hedonistic and there's nothing more sexy than revolution. In the first week I joined the Socialist Society and I formed the Dundee University Women's Liberation Society. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> After winning the Whitbread, did you worry that you wouldn't be able to match the achievement? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> It worried me more that I just couldn't write another book. I had already written half of Human Croquet before I won the Whitbread, but I think it would have been really hard to start another book after winning the prize. I felt that many people wanted Ruby II - more of Behind the Scenes - and they were never going to get that. The whole time I'm writing I don't think I can do it. I only start to relax when I'm about three quarters of the way through. </p> <p>I can't imagine what it would be like to write in a relaxed state. I'm going to be writing some stories for my own interest. I want to experiment with different things and see if I can approach writing with much less control and in a better psychological state. It will be like breaking out of a straitjacket. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you like to move the goalposts and experiment in your novels and not write to an audience? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> Yes, I do. Life is a very orderly thing, but in fiction there is a huge liberation and freedom. I can do what I like. There's nothing that says I can't write a page of full stops. There is no 'should' involved, although you wouldn't know that from literary reviews and critics. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you suffer from creative angst? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> I'm a bit like the padre in Catch 22 where he thinks everyone is going to die and terrible accidents are going to happen to his family. It is like the cat is always going to be killed on the railway line or the other motorist is going to drive into my daughter's car. But I never actually articulate those things because it is like tempting fate. So it becomes a dark wash in the background of your life. </p> <p>I'm also very good at being aware of all the awful things that could happen and also consciously closing the door on them. My attitude is that I know what the world is like but you have to behave like those things couldn't possibly happen to you. Otherwise, you are always living the possibility of the plane falling out of the sky. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> The next novel? </p> <p> <strong> KA: </strong> I won't be writing it for another two years and I don't know that much about it. There is a youngish woman in it, but she is going to be in the third person and one of three or four main characters that become more of an ensemble. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Where did the idea for the next book come from? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> I don't know. All sorts of places. From leftover things. It's so complicated and ridiculous. The title is going to be Dogs In Jeopardy, but it has no dogs in it and it's based on chaos theory. It's to do with chance meetings, the billiard ball theory that things ricochet off each other. I've got three main characters in my head so far and one is a murderer. I find it very hard to take large space in a text with a character that has a really bad story because it makes me feel unhappy. I have to have other people who are not having bad stories. The dark and the light. The balance. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you believe in God? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> I'm a lapsed Quaker. I don't go to meetings any more. But I'm very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I'd love to be a Catholic. I think it would be fantastic - faith, forgiveness, absolution, extreme unction - all these wonderful words. I don't think anyone who was ever born a Catholic hasn't died a Catholic, no matter how lapsed they are. I find faith fascinating because there is no intellectual content to it. It must be a wonderful thing to say you believe in something. I would love that. To do away with doubt and fear. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You were once described as having \"strikingly unfriendly attitudes to men and domestic life\". Does this still hold true? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> I have reached a point in my life where I no longer have sexist thoughts. I don't think that women are superior to men any more. But whether that was to do with marriage I don't know. There were times in my life where I believed women had natural superiority, but women have terrible faults and flaws. </p> <p>Part of that feeling is me as a wounded writer speaking because I am always reviewed by women and I've been at the end of bitchy journalism from women. In a way I think that has led me to reappraise women. </p> <p>There is no sisterhood. Women are their own worst enemies and behave very badly in some circles, in particular the media. Women are as helpless and hopeless as men but have their own areas for it. On the whole, apart from the war, violence, aggression, drunkenness thing, men are much better behaved. They have better manners and codes of conduct. I didn't have brothers and I haven't had sons so I've had a very insular female experience. Despite having been married twice, men are still a bit of a mystery to me. If I had brought up a son then that element of mystery might have been removed. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What do you wish for? </p> <p> <strong> KA:</strong> If you could give me one gift it would be siblings. If I had my time over again I would have five children at a young age when I had the energy, before I could even think about it. It would have been absolute hell for eight years, but then I would have all those children to look after me when I'm old. Being a mother is the most satisfying thing you can be. You know without a second thought or backward glance you would lay down your life for your child, and for me that is an extraordinary, amazing thing. You wouldn't do it for anything else, but you would do it for your child.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Philip French:</strong> A movie of the first rank, less flamboyant than Mann's earlier films, but as sombre and realised on the same grand scale and with the same feeling for space. ...&#91;It&#93; avoids triumphalism and the choices that confront Wigand and Bergman are never simplified</p>",
      "byline": "Philip French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For the best part of a century, the most desirable heroes of American cinema have carried two lethal props - the handgun and the cigarette. Generations of moviegoers have emulated them. </p> <p>For a year in the Army, I went out each morning with a loaded pistol strapped to my hip, feeling like a gunfighter or a private eye, and for 21 years my self-image as a confident adult was largely achieved by having a cigarette between my lips during most daylight hours. </p> <p>The murderous and suicidal implications of both actions were not lost on me. But they gave me immense pleasure and I got out of the Army without firing a shot in anger and gave up smoking before my health was permanently impaired. </p> <p>As a result, I feel a certain ambivalence when invited to join attacks on manufacturers of arms or tobacco. Arms manufacturers tend to use versions of the persuasive speeches Shaw put into the mouths of the munitions tycoon Undershaft in Major Barbara and thus are out in the open. </p> <p>But there can be no forgiving the hypocrisy with which the cigarette bosses defend their product or the ruthlessness with which they deploy their formidable power against critics. This is one of the key subjects of Michael Mann's engrossing political thriller The Insider , which pits a troubled scientist against his former employers, one of the top tobacco companies, whose chief executive officers are known as the Seven Dwarfs. </p> <p>The movie resembles All the President's Men and The China Syndrome in the way it involves the media manipulating whistle-blowers. Vulnerable people are persuaded to threaten the welfare of themselves and their families by making public evidence that will discredit the forces of the entrenched and powerful. </p> <p>The contrast between the private citizen and the professional investigator is cleverly spelt out in the opening sequences that crosscut between the lives of two men of probity involved with large corporations - Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a chemist with the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company, and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for CBS's 60 Minutes, America's most prestigious TV current affairs show. </p> <p>Wigand is an apparently happy husband and father of two, living a quiet, golf-playing corporate life of comfort in Louisville, Kentucky. But prompted by professional scruples, he has offended his smooth employers and been fired, though on generous terms that depend on his respecting professional confidentiality. Bergman is a volatile journalist, a creation of the radical Sixties, who constantly has big, dangerous stories on his stove. </p> <p>Currently on the front-burner is an interview between his show's veteran frontman, the 78-year-old Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer), and the head of Hezbollah, which we see him risking his life to set up. On the back-burners are investigations of a drug-laundering outfit, the Unabomber, and a technical aspect of the tobacco industry on which he needs expert advice. </p> <p>The latter brings Bergman into contact with Wigand and he rightly smells a story about the malfeasance of the tobacco business and the lies about nicotine addiction told on oath before a Congressional committee by the Seven Dwarfs. Bergman believes that in persuading Wigand to testify on the programme he is serving the public and getting the scientist to do what his conscience dictates. </p> <p>The result is an upheaval that changes the lives of both men.

      "bodyText": "For the best part of a century, the most desirable heroes of American cinema have carried two lethal props - the handgun and the cigarette. Generations of moviegoers have emulated them. For a year in the Army, I went out each morning with a loaded pistol strapped to my hip, feeling like a gunfighter or a private eye, and for 21 years my self-image as a confident adult was largely achieved by having a cigarette between my lips during most daylight hours. The murderous and suicidal implications of both actions were not lost on me. But they gave me immense pleasure and I got out of the Army without firing a shot in anger and gave up smoking before my health was permanently impaired. As a result, I feel a certain ambivalence when invited to join attacks on manufacturers of arms or tobacco. Arms manufacturers tend to use versions of the persuasive speeches Shaw put into the mouths of the munitions tycoon Undershaft in Major Barbara and thus are out in the open. But there can be no forgiving the hypocrisy with which the cigarette bosses defend their product or the ruthlessness with which they deploy their formidable power against critics. This is one of the key subjects of Michael Mann's engrossing political thriller The Insider , which pits a troubled scientist against his former employers, one of the top tobacco companies, whose chief executive officers are known as the Seven Dwarfs. The movie resembles All the President's Men and The China Syndrome in the way it involves the media manipulating whistle-blowers. Vulnerable people are persuaded to threaten the welfare of themselves and their families by making public evidence that will discredit the forces of the entrenched and powerful. The contrast between the private citizen and the professional investigator is cleverly spelt out in the opening sequences that crosscut between the lives of two men of probity involved with large corporations - Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a chemist with the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company, and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for CBS's 60 Minutes, America's most prestigious TV current affairs show. Wigand is an apparently happy husband and father of two, living a quiet, golf-playing corporate life of comfort in Louisville, Kentucky. But prompted by professional scruples, he has offended his smooth employers and been fired, though on generous terms that depend on his respecting professional confidentiality. Bergman is a volatile journalist, a creation of the radical Sixties, who constantly has big, dangerous stories on his stove. Currently on the front-burner is an interview between his show's veteran frontman, the 78-year-old Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer), and the head of Hezbollah, which we see him risking his life to set up. On the back-burners are investigations of a drug-laundering outfit, the Unabomber, and a technical aspect of the tobacco industry on which he needs expert advice. The latter brings Bergman into contact with Wigand and he rightly smells a story about the malfeasance of the tobacco business and the lies about nicotine addiction told on oath before a Congressional committee by the Seven Dwarfs. Bergman believes that in persuading Wigand to testify on the programme he is serving the public and getting the scientist to do what his conscience dictates. The result is an upheaval that changes the lives of both men. Significantly, on the day when the die is incautiously cast, the New York Times lead story is of O.J. Simpson's acquittal, a case of how in America the ruthless, consciousless rich can get away with murder. The Insider is a dark paranoid thriller, lit by Mann's regular photographer Dante Spinotti in the penumbrous style Gordon Willis developed in The Godfather and All the President's Men. Danger, real and imagined, lurks everywhere as the tobacco companies seek to silence Wigand. His pension is cut off; the family moves to a smaller house; he finds a job teaching chemistry in a high school. Obscene threats appear on his e-mail, his phone is bugged and he's followed by menacing agents. When the FBI are called in, they treat Wigand with suspicion, taking away his guns and his computer. It's suggested that the FBI men, expecting to get lucrative security jobs on retirement, are in league with big business. The final straw comes when the tobacco companies set out to destroy Wigand's character by feeding discreditable stories to the media. Wigand finds himself deserted by his wife and left, like Gary Cooper in High Noon, to face his enemies alone. Moreover, back at CBS headquarters in New York, the corporate lawyers are forcing Bergman's bosses to dilute the programme and to omit Wigand's testimony on the grounds that it could involve the network in 'tortious interference' in a contract between others. Bergman suspects that the real reason is that a high-profile legal action could affect the value of CBS shares on the eve of a lucrative merger.

      "body": "<p>11. <b>Adam Twiss</b>, 24 and <b>Damien Reeves</b>, 25</p> <p>Co-founders, Zeus Technology. \u00a313 million each.</p> <p>Zeus, like most internet companies, considers modest growth a sin against nature. In the last year the company has tripled its staff, moved to offices eight times larger than the last, and opened in the US. To top it off, last September Tony Blair chose its offices to launch his vision of a web-friendly Britain.</p> <p>'The Prime Minister's visit was exciting,' says Twiss. 'It is a sign that we are beginning to get there as a company.' Zeus was set up in 1995, which makes it one of the more established web companies around. It develops internet software which other web companies use to run their sites. They claim one site in 50 around the world runs on its technology.</p> <p>Adam Twiss and Damien Reeves ran their own chat and fan-based website in their final year at Cambridge where they both studied computer science. The site started to become so popular that it kept crashing under sheer weight of numbers. So they developed more sophisticated software to keep it working. They realised others who ran sites had the same problems and decided to set up a business offering their software. In September they secured more venture capital funding, though the pair had to cut their joint stake from 84 per cent of the company to 53 per cent. However, the company's value has risen from \u00a330m to \u00a350m, which means the value of their shares remain at \u00a313m each. The company plans to float in the next 12 months.</p> <p>Twiss says: 'A lot of people want to build up a company and sell it off before the perceived internet bubble bursts. I would not even describe many of these companies as internet businesses. Amazon is not an internet company, it is a book company. The web is just its medium. In just the same way, Direct Line is an insurance business. But we are an internet company. We make tools that make the web work better, and we are here to build a long-term business.'</p> <p>12. <b>Charles Cohen</b>, 30</p> <p>Co-founder, online loyalty scheme Beenz. \u00a312.5 million.</p> <p>Cohen says the best book he has read recently is a biography of Karl Marx. 'A lot of the terms the new economy uses are originally his, although a lot of internet businesspeople might not want to admit that.'</p> <p>Rather than not want to admit it, many would probably not have heard of the founding father of Communism. But Cohen is a bit of a rarity among the e-millionaires in that his early passion was politics - he studied for the 'politician's degree', politics, philosophy and economics, at Oxford - rather than getting involved in money-making ventures. A former Liberal Democrat speechwriter, he worked at the House of Commons but turned his back on politics to set up his first Internet venture in 1995.</p> <p>Over time, that enthusiasm developed into Beenz.com (after 'been there, done that'). In simple terms it is an online version of a supermarket loyalty scheme - points are earned when you buy things online, or simply by visiting websites, and can be spent with participating online traders. It was set up in December 1998 with \u00a3300,000 from a mixture of friends, family and small private investors. Cohen brought in Philip Letts of the Letts diaries family as chief executive, and in the space of 15 months the duo have raised \u00a320m of funding from a variety of sources including venture capitalist Apax Partners, Japanese cell phone distributor Hikari Tsushin, plus a personal stake from Larry Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, the world's second largest software manufacturer. They employ 100 people in Tokyo, London and New York. Market analysts value the company at \u00a362m. Cohen remains coy about his wealth. 'I've got no idea how the papers come up with these figures.' But basic maths dictates that 20 per cent of a company valued at \u00a362m means his stake is worth \u00a312.5m.</p> <p>He lives modestly in Crouch End, London, with his partner, and recently bought an A-class Mercedes - but before we could suggest that was a sign of his spending some of his virtual cash, he countered by explaining that it was bought to ferry around his baby daughter, Cecily.</p> <p>13. <b>Marcus Lauder</b>, 23</p> <p>Co-founder, Magic Moments. \u00a312.5 million.</p> <p>Marcus Lauder says he left his computer and electronics course at King's College London after only 18 months 'because I was distracted'. By what? 'By money.' 'You go to college in order to get a good job. But I was already doing a lot of consultancy work on the side. And I thought the course didn't concentrate on the most interesting work being done at the time, so I left.'</p> <p>Lauder developed his interest in computers at 13, when he developed and sold software packages from his Watford home. After quitting college, he set himself up as a consultant. He met two other consultants Abby Hardoon, 36, and Victor Gareh, 35, and in 1995, with \u00a38,000 put up by the two older men, they started Magic Moments offering internet services to business.</p> <p>Hardoon and Gareh handle business deals and administration, while Lauder takes care of technical matters. The real leap in value came last August when the company was floated on the Alternative Investment Market - for young companies - partly backed by PR man Matthew Freud and Manchester United director Michael Edelson. The business is currently valued at \u00a3125m, of which Lauder has a 10 per cent stake. Lauder's interest in computers is his own; his parents are publicans and still do not have a computer. He is about to move into a flat in Chiswick with his girlfriend. But in his spare time he builds and flies model rockets from scratch. 'That takes up a lot of my time and money,' he says. He holds the UK altitude record for flying a one-metre rocket 3,000 feet. You can buy a lot of Airfix rockets for \u00a312.5m.</p> <p>15. <b>James Page</b>, 29</p> <p>Co-founder, deckchair.com. \u00a312 million.</p> <p>This is the story of an internet fortune built on money which originally came from the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. If that is not exotic enough it also involves the Vietnam war, an Irish pop star, and cheap air tickets.</p> <p>James Page's parents met as journalists covering the war in Vietnam but they divorced when Page was very young. He spent his childhood travelling between England, America, the Caribbean and the Scottish Highlands to spend time with both his mother and father - which was also the start of his software obsession. 'I started programming when I was 12. It was a way I could escape from the world. I could just concentrate on the machine,' says Page, who paints a lonely picture of that time.</p> <p>Now, with Sir Bob Geldof, he is the co-founder of travel site deckchair.com which scans the web for cut-price airfares. Since its launch 11 months ago the company has received funding from private individuals including concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith and the Seiff family, which founded Marks and Spencer, valuing the company at \u00a330m - Page owns 40 per cent.</p> <p>A restless character, he quit college through 'boredom' after just six months, and in 1991 took his self-taught programming skills to computer games company Eidos - the inventor of the phenomenally successful Lara Croft character and the Tomb Raider series. When he quit Eidos, he bought shares in the company with money left to him by his great-aunt Monica Selton, a communist in the Fifties, who made anti-Allied broadcasts during the Korean War. Questions were asked about her treasonable behaviour in the House of Commons. Around the same time Selton decided to emigrate to the Soviet Union where Stalin himself gave her a peace prize - including cash. Selton left the money, a few thousand pounds, to her great-nephew. 'That money was my business stake,' laughs Page.</p> <p>Page lives with his wife, the Australian writer Justine Etler, in London's Covent Garden.</p> <p>16. <b>Stephen Short</b>, 28</p> <p>Property developer. \u00a311.75 million.</p> <p>Ask Welsh business journalists about one of the principality's richest personalities, Stephen Short, and you draw a blank. This ruddy-faced businessman is intensely shy and shuns all publicity. His secretary dismisses all pleas for an interview saying 'he never talks to the press'. The only thing she lets slip is that he rents a box at the new Millennium Stadium in Cardiff from where he indulges his passion for rugby.</p> <p>But the Cardiff construction and property communities do know him. They paint a picture of a family dynasty. These days his father, Gabriel Short, is considered to be its head. The family originally made its money from supplying contract-based industrial services to the British Steel industry. From there, they diversified into construction and they also have considerable commercial property interests in South Wales.</p> <p>The younger Short owned 35 per cent of the family's main business, Short Bros, which last year had a turnover of \u00a360m. Last November, Short Bros was sold to Australian industrial giant Brambles Industries for \u00a325 million. This alone provided Short with an \u00a38.75m windfall. The family created a second company, Short Developments, last year after the Brambles sale, presumably to house their growing property interests.</p> <p>Stephen Short also owns property in his own right particularly in the Cardiff Bay area. He bought a 13-acre plot there four years ago for \u00a3750,000. Since then, the area has boomed and the value of this investment is likely to have at least doubled. With other properties, it is possible that his wealth could be boosted by \u00a3150,000 per year in rent. If he were to sell all his assets today they could add a further \u00a33m to his value.</p> <p>Those who have met Short describe him as a soberly dressed man of 5ft 7ins with mousy blond hair parted to one side. 'To look at him, you'd never consider him rich,' one source said. Although polite and considered 'a bit of a thinker', in meetings he is known to have temper tantrums if things don't go according to plan.</p> <p>17. <b>Andrew Foyle</b>, 28</p> <p>Software developer. \u00a310 million.</p> <p>If you have read any of the millions of words written about how in the future you will use your mobile phone to connect to the internet then you will understand why Andrew Foyle's Argo Interactive has been valued by a consortium of venture capitalists at \u00a350m.</p> <p>It is developing the software that will link the phone to cyberspace.

      "bodyText": "11. Adam Twiss, 24 and Damien Reeves, 25 Co-founders, Zeus Technology. \u00a313 million each. Zeus, like most internet companies, considers modest growth a sin against nature. In the last year the company has tripled its staff, moved to offices eight times larger than the last, and opened in the US. To top it off, last September Tony Blair chose its offices to launch his vision of a web-friendly Britain. 'The Prime Minister's visit was exciting,' says Twiss. 'It is a sign that we are beginning to get there as a company.' Zeus was set up in 1995, which makes it one of the more established web companies around. It develops internet software which other web companies use to run their sites. They claim one site in 50 around the world runs on its technology. Adam Twiss and Damien Reeves ran their own chat and fan-based website in their final year at Cambridge where they both studied computer science. The site started to become so popular that it kept crashing under sheer weight of numbers. So they developed more sophisticated software to keep it working. They realised others who ran sites had the same problems and decided to set up a business offering their software. In September they secured more venture capital funding, though the pair had to cut their joint stake from 84 per cent of the company to 53 per cent. However, the company's value has risen from \u00a330m to \u00a350m, which means the value of their shares remain at \u00a313m each. The company plans to float in the next 12 months. Twiss says: 'A lot of people want to build up a company and sell it off before the perceived internet bubble bursts. I would not even describe many of these companies as internet businesses. Amazon is not an internet company, it is a book company. The web is just its medium. In just the same way, Direct Line is an insurance business. But we are an internet company. We make tools that make the web work better, and we are here to build a long-term business.' 12. Charles Cohen, 30 Co-founder, online loyalty scheme Beenz. \u00a312.5 million. Cohen says the best book he has read recently is a biography of Karl Marx. 'A lot of the terms the new economy uses are originally his, although a lot of internet businesspeople might not want to admit that.' Rather than not want to admit it, many would probably not have heard of the founding father of Communism. But Cohen is a bit of a rarity among the e-millionaires in that his early passion was politics - he studied for the 'politician's degree', politics, philosophy and economics, at Oxford - rather than getting involved in money-making ventures. A former Liberal Democrat speechwriter, he worked at the House of Commons but turned his back on politics to set up his first Internet venture in 1995. Over time, that enthusiasm developed into Beenz.com (after 'been there, done that'). In simple terms it is an online version of a supermarket loyalty scheme - points are earned when you buy things online, or simply by visiting websites, and can be spent with participating online traders. It was set up in December 1998 with \u00a3300,000 from a mixture of friends, family and small private investors. Cohen brought in Philip Letts of the Letts diaries family as chief executive, and in the space of 15 months the duo have raised \u00a320m of funding from a variety of sources including venture capitalist Apax Partners, Japanese cell phone distributor Hikari Tsushin, plus a personal stake from Larry Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, the world's second largest software manufacturer. They employ 100 people in Tokyo, London and New York. Market analysts value the company at \u00a362m. Cohen remains coy about his wealth. 'I've got no idea how the papers come up with these figures.' But basic maths dictates that 20 per cent of a company valued at \u00a362m means his stake is worth \u00a312.5m. He lives modestly in Crouch End, London, with his partner, and recently bought an A-class Mercedes - but before we could suggest that was a sign of his spending some of his virtual cash, he countered by explaining that it was bought to ferry around his baby daughter, Cecily. 13. Marcus Lauder, 23 Co-founder, Magic Moments. \u00a312.5 million. Marcus Lauder says he left his computer and electronics course at King's College London after only 18 months 'because I was distracted'. By what? 'By money.' 'You go to college in order to get a good job. But I was already doing a lot of consultancy work on the side. And I thought the course didn't concentrate on the most interesting work being done at the time, so I left.' Lauder developed his interest in computers at 13, when he developed and sold software packages from his Watford home. After quitting college, he set himself up as a consultant. He met two other consultants Abby Hardoon, 36, and Victor Gareh, 35, and in 1995, with \u00a38,000 put up by the two older men, they started Magic Moments offering internet services to business. Hardoon and Gareh handle business deals and administration, while Lauder takes care of technical matters. The real leap in value came last August when the company was floated on the Alternative Investment Market - for young companies - partly backed by PR man Matthew Freud and Manchester United director Michael Edelson. The business is currently valued at \u00a3125m, of which Lauder has a 10 per cent stake. Lauder's interest in computers is his own; his parents are publicans and still do not have a computer. He is about to move into a flat in Chiswick with his girlfriend. But in his spare time he builds and flies model rockets from scratch. 'That takes up a lot of my time and money,' he says. He holds the UK altitude record for flying a one-metre rocket 3,000 feet. You can buy a lot of Airfix rockets for \u00a312.5m. 15. James Page, 29 Co-founder, deckchair.com. \u00a312 million. This is the story of an internet fortune built on money which originally came from the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. If that is not exotic enough it also involves the Vietnam war, an Irish pop star, and cheap air tickets. James Page's parents met as journalists covering the war in Vietnam but they divorced when Page was very young. He spent his childhood travelling between England, America, the Caribbean and the Scottish Highlands to spend time with both his mother and father - which was also the start of his software obsession. 'I started programming when I was 12. It was a way I could escape from the world. I could just concentrate on the machine,' says Page, who paints a lonely picture of that time. Now, with Sir Bob Geldof, he is the co-founder of travel site deckchair.com which scans the web for cut-price airfares. Since its launch 11 months ago the company has received funding from private individuals including concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith and the Seiff family, which founded Marks and Spencer, valuing the company at \u00a330m - Page owns 40 per cent. A restless character, he quit college through 'boredom' after just six months, and in 1991 took his self-taught programming skills to computer games company Eidos - the inventor of the phenomenally successful Lara Croft character and the Tomb Raider series. When he quit Eidos, he bought shares in the company with money left to him by his great-aunt Monica Selton, a communist in the Fifties, who made anti-Allied broadcasts during the Korean War. Questions were asked about her treasonable behaviour in the House of Commons. Around the same time Selton decided to emigrate to the Soviet Union where Stalin himself gave her a peace prize - including cash. Selton left the money, a few thousand pounds, to her great-nephew. 'That money was my business stake,' laughs Page. Page lives with his wife, the Australian writer Justine Etler, in London's Covent Garden. 16. Stephen Short, 28 Property developer. \u00a311.75 million. Ask Welsh business journalists about one of the principality's richest personalities, Stephen Short, and you draw a blank. This ruddy-faced businessman is intensely shy and shuns all publicity. His secretary dismisses all pleas for an interview saying 'he never talks to the press'. The only thing she lets slip is that he rents a box at the new Millennium Stadium in Cardiff from where he indulges his passion for rugby. But the Cardiff construction and property communities do know him. They paint a picture of a family dynasty. These days his father, Gabriel Short, is considered to be its head. The family originally made its money from supplying contract-based industrial services to the British Steel industry. From there, they diversified into construction and they also have considerable commercial property interests in South Wales. The younger Short owned 35 per cent of the family's main business, Short Bros, which last year had a turnover of \u00a360m. Last November, Short Bros was sold to Australian industrial giant Brambles Industries for \u00a325 million. This alone provided Short with an \u00a38.75m windfall. The family created a second company, Short Developments, last year after the Brambles sale, presumably to house their growing property interests. Stephen Short also owns property in his own right particularly in the Cardiff Bay area. He bought a 13-acre plot there four years ago for \u00a3750,000. Since then, the area has boomed and the value of this investment is likely to have at least doubled. With other properties, it is possible that his wealth could be boosted by \u00a3150,000 per year in rent. If he were to sell all his assets today they could add a further \u00a33m to his value. Those who have met Short describe him as a soberly dressed man of 5ft 7ins with mousy blond hair parted to one side. 'To look at him, you'd never consider him rich,' one source said. Although polite and considered 'a bit of a thinker', in meetings he is known to have temper tantrums if things don't go according to plan. 17. Andrew Foyle, 28 Software developer. \u00a310 million. If you have read any of the millions of words written about how in the future you will use your mobile phone to connect to the internet then you will understand why Andrew Foyle's Argo Interactive has been valued by a consortium of venture capitalists at \u00a350m. It is developing the software that will link the phone to cyberspace. And that is valuable to the mobile phone companies and almost every other internet venture in the world. It is the current technology Holy Grail - there are 20 million people in the UK with mobile phones as opposed to only five million with PCs at home - to get more people to use the net. In the overheated world of the internet, Foyle is right when he says, 'we are a hot company in a hot space'. Like others on this list, Foyle never made it to college. A year off between school and university became permanent. 'Business just took over.' He set up Argo four years ago and last month hired an experienced chief executive to take over from him while he became president of the firm. He has also reduced his stake in the company from 50 to 10 per cent to get a cash injection from investors 3i and Apax Partners. But he is philosophical: 'I'd rather have a small piece in a very big company than a big part in a small company.' His new job as president - it is his role to 'evangelise on behalf of the company' - means he is looking for a flat in London. But he will spend most of his time commuting from the home in Chichester he shares with girlfriend Susan, a TV production assistant. 19 and 20. Emma Edelson, 25 and Robert Jenkin, 22 Internet investors. \u00a39 million each. Emma Edelson typifies many of the new breed of entrepreneurs blending youthful enthusiasm with the ability to secure access to money and contacts, often gained through familial ties. Edelson, 25, is one of four twentysomethings who founded Oxygen. It's an internet incubator fund which buys a chunk in a start-up company, develops it and then floats it on the stock market, thus capitalising on the original investment. If the Edelson name sounds familiar, it will be because of her father Michael, the Manchester United director and City deal-maker, who hit the headlines last year when one of the companies he chairs, Knutsford, saw its share price soar from 2p to 232p in one day. He masterminded a similarly dramatic flotation for his daughter's company and provided her with access to financial backing, thanks to his well-developed network of City contacts. But it will be Edelson junior and her three co-fund managers - Robert Jenkin, 22, Paul Harris, 24, and Kirsti Pinnell, 25 - who call the shots. Emma Edelson and Jenkin, who previously worked for a venture capital firm, got the idea to launch Oxygen while at university together.

      "body": "<p>The wait for the asparagus season is interminable. As much as I love a jumble of woody parsnips, frozen leeks and carrots as fat as your arm in a winter soup, I cannot help but bemoan the cook's lot at this time of year. I am sick of cauliflower, have had my fill of roast onions, and let's face it, artichoke soup is only funny once or twice a year, even when the charming honey-coloured tubers are peeled and simmered with chicken stock then whizzed to a velvet pur\u00e9e with Jersey cream and a whole handful of emerald parsley. It is enough to make a man eat mangetout. </p> <p>I cannot pretend I enjoy vegetable shopping so early in the spring. But it has to be done, otherwise it's frozen peas again or some of Holland's insipid offerings. (I once asked a Dutch cook why none of her countryfolk ever wrote to me berating my attacks on Dutch fruit and vegetables. 'Because most of us agree with you,' came the reply). So let us say my heart wasn't exactly racing on my way to the market yesterday. In fact, I dawdled all the way, taking in every book shop and estate agent's window and even stopping for a cup of coffee en route. I suspect this is not how anyone should go shopping for food, least of all someone who actually sees greed as a good thing. </p> <p>There, in among the beige and grey so typical of any food market in March, was an entire stall of glorious greens. A trestle table piled high with vivid, punchy cabbages and rich, sea-green spring leaves. There were metre-long stalks of sprouts for you to snap off your own Brussels one by one. A mound of cabbages as tight as a clenched fist. A small mountain of elegant purple leaves. There were frilly Savoys with their bloom of dusky blue, and boxes of round white cabbage almost hard enough to be considered an offensive weapon. </p> <p>Best of all, there was purple spouting with long blue-green leaves and tight heads of deepest purple. I do regard this as poor man's asparagus, but only just. The long spears, some measuring almost a foot long, are both tender and juicy and cooked in a couple of minutes. I dunk mine into hollandaise, just as I will the asparagus when it comes. It is good, blissfully good, to eat purple sprouting this way, but there is more than pure pleasure here. Everyone from Popeye to the hottest nutritionist in town will tell you how good greens are for you. So much do they bang on about the goodness of broccoli I cannot help but wonder if they have shares in the stuff. </p> <p>Back in the kitchen, I would be happy enough with my greens lightly steamed and quickly buttered, but I really cannot see why anything so good should stay at the side of the plate. Thin-leaved cabbages can be almost as tender as spinach, so I roll up the washed leaves and shred them as fine as angel hair then dunk them into hot, clear soup, perhaps with a few little stars of pasta. Anything thicker, or leaves that take easier to coarse chopping, get steamed first for a minute or two then stirred into rich bean soup-stews. Hard white cabbage can take quite a bit of cooking, and I tend to stick it in earlier than I would any of the dark-green varieties. It is marvellous in one of those slow-cooked soups with beans and ham hocks. </p> <p>Bacon and pork have an almost mythical affinity with greens, even something as straight forward as a stir-fry with bacon gets my vote, but I think we can do even better than that. Last night I threw some purple sprouting into my pasta to make a supper that managed to marry the healthy veg to a rather obscene amount of cream. And for lunch today I folded some dressed Cromer crab into fine strands of steamed cabbage to give an admittedly spartan but clean-tasting lunch. </p> <p>The best part of a Chinese meal is when I remember to order the greens in oyster sauce. Likewise the Sunday roast, which can seem almost pointless without its neat pile of buttered cabbage. A side order of greens somehow brings the whole meal together. The clincher. And while no one could ever accuse me of believing in the British system of meat and two veg, I would feel cheated without something leafy next to meat and gravy. </p> <p>I see nothing wrong with the old-fashioned mum's way of cooking greens, then squeezing them between two plates to get rid of any excess water then tossing them in melted butter. I would add an almost invisible grating of nutmeg and some black pepper, too, but I do think this method produces wonderfully silky, buttery greens. A squirt of lemon juice in there wouldn't hurt, either. </p> <p>Could I make a plea for Brussels sprout tops, too? They look, for those who have never come across them, like miniature Savoy cabbages and are pure melt-in-the-mouth vegetables when steamed and buttered. I cannot recommend steaming greens too highly. Just dump the shredded greens in a colander over a pot of boiling water and they are ready in minutes. A shake of soy sauce is as much embellishment as they need. There is something about a cabbage leaf or stem of sprouting that hasn't seen water that makes you think it is even better for you. </p> <p>But we are in search of pleasure rather than health here, so yes, it is lush and perky greens for supper, but hopefully not without a little hollandaise sauce to tide us through till the asparagus is ready. </p> <p> <strong> Penne with purple sprouting and cream</strong> </p> <p> I have done this recipe with workaday green broccoli, too, and it was fine. A great quick weekday supper. Serves two. </p> <p>275g penne or similar shaped dried pasta </p> <p>250g purple sprouting broccoli </p> <p>30g butter </p> <p>2 cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced </p> <p>4 anchovy fillets, rinsed and chopped </p> <p>150ml double cream </p> <p>50g freshly grated Parmesan </p> <p>Put two deep pans of water on to boil. Trim the purple sprouting, keeping the leaves intact and trimming any dry ends or tough stalks. Salt the water heavily in one of the pans and drop in the pasta, turning the heat down slightly once it has come back to the boil. </p> <p>Salt the water in the other pan and add the purple sprouting. As soon as the sprouting is tender, a matter of four or five minutes, drain it and wipe out the pan, returning it to the heat with the butter, garlic and anchovies. Let the garlic and anchovies cook slowly for a minute or two then pour in the cream and bring to the boil, immediately turning it down to a slow bubble. Chop the purple sprouting roughly then add it to the cream and season with black pepper. </p> <p>Drain the pasta and tip it into the broccoli sauce. Fold in the Parmesan cheese. </p> <p> <strong> Spring cabbage with garlic and soy</strong> </p> <p> Straightforward, sassy greens to serve on the side. Serves two as a side dish. </p> <p>200g spring greens </p> <p>groundnut or vegetable oil </p> <p>2 plump, juicy garlic cloves </p> <p>dark soy sauce </p> <p>Wash the leaves then tear them up, or shred them with a large knife into manageable pieces. </p> <p>Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a wok or large pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. When it is hot and slightly shimmering, squash the garlic cloves then add them to the oil. Their job is to scent the oil, nothing more. </p> <p>When the oil is crackling and bubbling around the garlic, toss in the greens. There will be an almighty spit and crackle. The smell of garlic will rise up. Cook them for about four minutes, moving them round with chopsticks (it makes not the slightest difference what you use, but chopsticks will make you feel the part), until they have wilted and their colour is bright. </p> <p>Add a few shakes of soy sauce. Six will be enough. The amount is up to you, but the coarser-tasting greens will take quite a bit of it - soy seems to mellow their earthy bitterness. </p> <p>Serve blisteringly hot, salty and green from the pan. </p> <p> <strong> Spring greens with oyster sauce</strong> </p> <p> You can use any greens here. I prefer the silkier greens like spring greens or spinach, though I have used the broccoli family, too. Enough for four as a side dish. </p> <p>500g spring greens </p> <p>3 tbsps oyster sauce </p> <p>1 tsp groundnut oil </p> <p>tsp chilli sauce </p> <p>Wash the greens and tear or cut them into large pieces. Bring a pan of water to the boil, salt it and drop the greens in, letting them boil for a few minutes only. They should be tender within two or three minutes. </p> <p>Mix the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. </p> <p>Drain the greens carefully so that all the water is removed, then put them in a warm serving dish. Pour the sauce over the hot greens and toss gently.</p>",

Serves two. 275g penne or similar shaped dried pasta 250g purple sprouting broccoli 30g butter 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced 4 anchovy fillets, rinsed and chopped 150ml double cream 50g freshly grated Parmesan Put two deep pans of water on to boil. Trim the purple sprouting, keeping the leaves intact and trimming any dry ends or tough stalks. Salt the water heavily in one of the pans and drop in the pasta, turning the heat down slightly once it has come back to the boil. Salt the water in the other pan and add the purple sprouting. As soon as the sprouting is tender, a matter of four or five minutes, drain it and wipe out the pan, returning it to the heat with the butter, garlic and anchovies. Let the garlic and anchovies cook slowly for a minute or two then pour in the cream and bring to the boil, immediately turning it down to a slow bubble. Chop the purple sprouting roughly then add it to the cream and season with black pepper. Drain the pasta and tip it into the broccoli sauce. Fold in the Parmesan cheese. Spring cabbage with garlic and soy Straightforward, sassy greens to serve on the side. Serves two as a side dish. 200g spring greens groundnut or vegetable oil 2 plump, juicy garlic cloves dark soy sauce Wash the leaves then tear them up, or shred them with a large knife into manageable pieces. Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a wok or large pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. When it is hot and slightly shimmering, squash the garlic cloves then add them to the oil. Their job is to scent the oil, nothing more. When the oil is crackling and bubbling around the garlic, toss in the greens. There will be an almighty spit and crackle. The smell of garlic will rise up. Cook them for about four minutes, moving them round with chopsticks (it makes not the slightest difference what you use, but chopsticks will make you feel the part), until they have wilted and their colour is bright. Add a few shakes of soy sauce. Six will be enough. The amount is up to you, but the coarser-tasting greens will take quite a bit of it - soy seems to mellow their earthy bitterness. Serve blisteringly hot, salty and green from the pan. Spring greens with oyster sauce You can use any greens here. I prefer the silkier greens like spring greens or spinach, though I have used the broccoli family, too. Enough for four as a side dish. 500g spring greens 3 tbsps oyster sauce 1 tsp groundnut oil tsp chilli sauce Wash the greens and tear or cut them into large pieces. Bring a pan of water to the boil, salt it and drop the greens in, letting them boil for a few minutes only. They should be tender within two or three minutes. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Drain the greens carefully so that all the water is removed, then put them in a warm serving dish. Pour the sauce over the hot greens and toss gently.",

      "body": "<p>Following Stephen King's car accident in June 1999, the publishing world was understandably concerned about the output of the 'world's best-selling novelist'. Between August last year, when he returned to writing after an intense period of surgery and recuperation, and January of this year, King had only managed to complete a novella, some short stories, a memoir-cum-how-to-write book and the early stages of a TV mini-series. Clearly, by his own standards of performance, he was in the paralysing grip of writer's block. </p> <p>The affliction has cropped up periodically in King's fiction - most notably in The Shining (which, paradoxically, he wrote in a month) and Bag of Bones - but a difficulty with writing words is not something the author has had much experience of in reality. This week sees his 30th novel, Riding the Bullet , which, in a possible foretaste of the future, will be published solely on the Internet. He has also produced six novels under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman, as well as 14 other books including short-story collections and non-fiction. Then there are the 27 movie adaptations, nine of which he has scripted, and the eight TV films and mini-series. For some time, he even replied personally to his fan mail. </p> <p>The novels, it should be mentioned, are infrequently slim volumes. It , for example, weighed in at 1,138 pages, and more often than not his macabre tomes can double as exercise aids. As he once put it: 'I write like fat ladies diet.' He types away at a rate of 750,000 words a year, every year since 1974, when Carrie , his debut, unleashed the geysers of blood and gore that have filled King's distinctive vision of American suburbia. </p> <p>But that's enough critical analysis. His is the kind of literary success that requires discussion in terms of numbers rather than words. He has, after all, sold 300 million books. His publishers, Simon and Schuster, could be forgiven, then, for beginning to wonder if the well has run dry. Especially as they recently signed a \u00a330 million three-book deal with King. Riding the Bullet is apparently part of the package. It is also just 69 pages long - the kind of entertainment that the master of horror formerly took all of a fortnight to knock out. </p> <p>Even before the accident, King was suggesting that he was running out of words, prompting speculation that he might be down to his last million. 'A writer has only a finite number of stories to write,' he said in 1998. 'I think I'm very near the end of publishing my work.' </p> <p>In the wake of the crash, he has sounded still more pessimistic about his literary future. 'Maybe there'll be another book, maybe there won't. I'm more concerned with walking again without crutches.' </p> <p>Of the accident itself, commentators and fans were quick to point out its uncanny resemblance to King's own fiction: car crashes feature in Misery , in which a writer is crippled, and Pet Sematry . But the real-life outcome was more reminiscent of JG Ballard's work. King suffered a shattered hip and pelvis, broken ribs and a fractured thigh bone, all of which needed six operations. 'My entire waist was turned around sideways and I could see this bulge in the side of my jeans,' he later deadpanned. 'And I thought to myself, \"If that's a bone, I'm in trouble here.\"' </p> <p>The injuries were the result of a collision with a Dodge Caravan. King was walking close to his summer home in North Lovell, Maine, when the car came off the road and hit him. The driver turned out to be wrestling with his rottweiller, named Bullet, at the time of impact. Incredibly, despite a long record of driving offences, the motorist had his license revoked for just one year. </p> <p>Embittered, King did a very Ballardian thing. He bought the Dodge for $1,600 and announced that he intended to 'beat the hell out of it' with a sledgehammer, if and when he regained his fitness. He had originally taken up his daily walk to lose weight. Since the accident, his 6ft 3in frame has shrunk by three stone. </p> <p>Now 52, King had for many years retained an almost teenage geekiness, enhanced by a mop-top haircut, conspicuous front-teeth and thick glasses, as well as a weakness for jeans and hard rock music. Suddenly, however, frail and wearied, he looks his age, if not older. 'He genuinely thought he was going to die,' said his friend, the humourist Dave Barry. </p> <p>Perhaps lucky to be alive, King has not always enjoyed the most auspicious of breaks. When he was two, his father stepped out to buy a packet of cigarettes and was never heard from again (although his mother thought she spotted him in a Sixties newsreel about white mercenaries in the Congo). He was a sickly child, once bedridden for a year, and his mother struggled to look after him and his brother, as she travelled around the country looking for work and family support. </p> <p>A bright student, he gained a degree in English from the University of Maine, in whose library he met his wife, Tabitha. After college, he subsidised teaching work with a job as a labourer in a laundry. He and Tabitha lived in a trailer in a town called called Hermon, Maine. King once described it as 'if not the asshole of the universe, then at least within farting distance of it'. </p> <p>It was here, with two children to look after, that he had four novels turned down by publishers. His fifth, he consigned to the waste bin, after further refusals, only for his wife to retrieve it and encourage him to persevere. Eventually, in 1973, Doubleday sent him a $2,500 acceptance cheque for Carrie . Two months later, still living in his trailer, he learned that the paperback rights had been bought for $420,000. He was so stunned that he went straight out and bought his wife a present: a $29 hairdryer. Shortly afterwards, his mother died of cancer, never really getting to see, still less benefit from, her son's phenomenal success. </p> <p>In 1988, King joined Alcoholics Anonymous. 'I have a totally addictive personality,' he admitted. 'I've never met a drink or a drug I don't like.' In particular, he had developed an intensely fond relationship with cocaine. Seemingly, it was not enough that he was he getting through three quarter of a million words a year, he also found time to nurture not one but two debilitating dependencies. </p> <p>Far more of his vast fortune - he was estimated to have earned \u00a353 million in 1997 alone - has gone on philanthropy, however, than pharmaceuticals. He has donated large sums to his alma mater, runs a number of libraries, bought two local radio stations that were in jeopardy, and built a baseball park for kids, among an impressive number of other charitable causes he supports. Exactly why King has been so productive he has never been able to explain. Occasionally he hints that writing channels the demons that otherwise could grow sociopathically destructive. But the suspicion remains that he simply loves telling stories. The ideas, he says, come 'like phone calls from nowhere'. </p> <p>What is clear is that the sheer mass of words has served to crush critical appreciation. Unlike, say, Thomas Harris, a populist whose three novels have won literary acclaim, the prolific King is not seen in smart circles as an innovator, so much as an industry. </p> <p>Yet it is King who has taken the first steps into the electronic age, just as he helped pioneer audio books (his short story collection Blood and Smoke was only released on tape) and revived the serialised novel with The Green Mile (published in instalments). The media conglomerates that nowadays control publishing houses will be studying the response to Riding The Bullet , which will be available to download from midnight on Monday at a cost of $2.50. At the same time, King's obsessive army of fans will be hoping that Bullet - the restless rottweiller - has not left their hero with nothing more to say. </p> <p><strong> Stephen Edwin King</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> Portland, Maine, 1947 </p> <p><strong> AKA:</strong> Richard Bachman </p> <p><strong> Family:</strong> Wife Tabitha Spruce; one daughter (Naomi Rachel), two sons (Joe Hill, Owen Phillip) </p> <p><strong> Studied: </strong> University of Maine (English) </p> <p><strong> Latest work: </strong> Riding the Bullet (published on the Internet) </p> <p><strong> Other works:</strong> Carrie , The Green Mile , Misery, Pet Sematary , The Shining </p> <p><strong> Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com\">www.stephenking.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine: it's a dark night, and you are trying to get some cash from an ATM machine. Suddenly you notice a large figure in uniform behind you. Distracted, you mistype your PIN number. The machine demands you type it again, so you do - and collect your money. </p> <p>Then the figure puts his hand on your shoulder and you discover he's a policeman. A large, unfriendly policeman. He says he has reason to suspect you are up to no good and demands that you tell him your PIN number. You refuse or, in the confusion, you can't remember it. </p> <p>Before you know what's happening you've been arrested and are standing before a judge. The charge? Failing to disclose your PIN number to a duly authorised person. The fact that you cannot remember it is no defence. It is assumed that you were up to no good - unless you can prove to the contrary. You are sent down for two years. </p> <p>Unbelievable? Couldn't happen in a liberal democracy? Well, I have news for you. </p> <p>Last week Jack Straw, New Labour's avuncular Interior Minister, introduced a Bill into the Commons which aims to create an analogous situation in relation to data encryption. A PIN number is analogous to a cryptographic key such as you might use to protect your email - or confidential files on your hard disk - from prying eyes. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill gives Mr Straw the power to demand you decrypt data on demand. Failing to provide the key will be a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, and carries with it the presumption of guilt. You must somehow prove you do not have the key. That you may have mislaid or forgotten it will not be a defence. </p> <p>And if, having suffered a miscarriage of justice under this statute, you decide to complain in public, 'Liberal Jack' has another ace up his sleeve - you can be sent down for a further five years! </p> <p>Meanwhile, paedophiles and criminals, who really do have appalling stuff on their disks and in their emails, will keep their mouths shut and take the two years for refusing to decrypt on demand. After all, it's a better deal than doing five to 10 years for a really serious offence. </p> <p>There is more. </p> <p>The Bill requires UK Internet Service Providers to install systems which will allow Secretary Straw and his duly authorised goons to track subscribers' communications traffic. That means every email you send - and every reply you receive, plus information on every website you've visited, every book you've bought from Amazon, every air-ticket you've purchased, every piece of software you've ever downloaded. And if you have encrypted your communications - well, see the last paragraph, but one above. </p> <p>On what grounds might the Interior Ministry justify such an invasion of your privacy?

      "bodyText": "Imagine: it's a dark night, and you are trying to get some cash from an ATM machine. Suddenly you notice a large figure in uniform behind you. Distracted, you mistype your PIN number. The machine demands you type it again, so you do - and collect your money. Then the figure puts his hand on your shoulder and you discover he's a policeman. A large, unfriendly policeman. He says he has reason to suspect you are up to no good and demands that you tell him your PIN number. You refuse or, in the confusion, you can't remember it. Before you know what's happening you've been arrested and are standing before a judge. The charge? Failing to disclose your PIN number to a duly authorised person. The fact that you cannot remember it is no defence. It is assumed that you were up to no good - unless you can prove to the contrary. You are sent down for two years. Unbelievable? Couldn't happen in a liberal democracy? Well, I have news for you. Last week Jack Straw, New Labour's avuncular Interior Minister, introduced a Bill into the Commons which aims to create an analogous situation in relation to data encryption. A PIN number is analogous to a cryptographic key such as you might use to protect your email - or confidential files on your hard disk - from prying eyes. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill gives Mr Straw the power to demand you decrypt data on demand. Failing to provide the key will be a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, and carries with it the presumption of guilt. You must somehow prove you do not have the key. That you may have mislaid or forgotten it will not be a defence. And if, having suffered a miscarriage of justice under this statute, you decide to complain in public, 'Liberal Jack' has another ace up his sleeve - you can be sent down for a further five years! Meanwhile, paedophiles and criminals, who really do have appalling stuff on their disks and in their emails, will keep their mouths shut and take the two years for refusing to decrypt on demand. After all, it's a better deal than doing five to 10 years for a really serious offence. There is more. The Bill requires UK Internet Service Providers to install systems which will allow Secretary Straw and his duly authorised goons to track subscribers' communications traffic. That means every email you send - and every reply you receive, plus information on every website you've visited, every book you've bought from Amazon, every air-ticket you've purchased, every piece of software you've ever downloaded. And if you have encrypted your communications - well, see the last paragraph, but one above. On what grounds might the Interior Ministry justify such an invasion of your privacy? Here's a list from Section 20 of the Bill: national security (not defined, of course); preventing or detecting crime; preventing disorder; public safety; protecting public health. Oh, and Mr Straw can lawfully authorise electronic snooping 'in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom'. Imagine how that last justification will play with foreign businesses wondering whether to set up in e-commerce in the UK. And then ponder the fact that the official line is to make the UK the most e-friendly state in Europe by 2002. Joined-up government, my eye. Meanwhile, the Irish government is legislating to make it illegal even for it to snoop on Internet traffic, so if this Bill makes it to the Statute book we can all move to Irish ISPs. I wonder what Secretary Straw will do about that? john.naughton@observer.co.uk \u0095 For links and background see www.briefhistory.com/footnotes",

Most of the 40 business people - valued at a minimum of \u00a32.2 million each - are public school-educated and at least 13 are Oxbridge graduates. Among the entrepreneurs are: \u0095 Toby Rowland, 30, son of former Lonrho chief, Tiny. The son is a co-founder of a the Internet business called Clickmango.com, which sells health and beauty products. \u0095 The Gestetner brothers, Daniel and Leo, whose family sold its photocopying business for \u00a3179m in 1996. They now run shopsmart.com. \u0095 Mark Slater, given a share portfolio for his sixteenth birthday by financier father Jim Slater, who was part of Slater-Walker Securities, which crashed in the Seventies. Mark runs the invest ment firm Internet Indirect. \u0095 Emma Edelson, daughter of Michael Edelson, the Manchester United director and City deal maker. Michael masterminded the dramatic flotation of his daughter's Internet investment company, Oxygen, in February and provided her with access to financial backing through his well-developed network of City contacts. Oxygen investors include the fashionable public relations expert Matthew Freud and BSkyB boss Elisabeth Murdoch. The survey exposes the myth that the Internet has ushered in a new wave of tycoons to sweep away the old establishment. It shows that those making most out of technology are the same as they have always been, and money and contacts are still crucial. Venture capitalists estimate that it costs between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000 to get a dot.com company up and running. The Young Rich survey also reveals: \u0095 The 19-year-old banned from casual sex or going out alone after 11pm by financial backers who fear rivals will pinch his secret invention. \u0095 The company created by Posh Spice and her mother to sell David Beckham's name. \u0095 The 16-year-old aristocrat who will inherit \u00a3850m including 100 acres around London's Oxford Street. \u0095 How British Young Rich compare with their counterparts in in Germany, Spain, Sweden and the US.",

      "body": "<p>21 and 22. <b>Serena Doshi</b>, 26 and <b>Ewan MacLeod</b>, 22</p> <p>Co-founders, liv4now.com. \u00a38 million each.</p> <p>When I meet Serena Doshi at her office she is immediately explaining that she has just flown in from a meeting in Canada, and apologising for wearing glasses not contact lenses, and introducing me to her partner Ewan MacLeod, and debating which hotel bar we should go to for a drink. Doshi has the slightly breathless enthusiasm of the suddenly successful. With MacLeod, she started her dot.com Liv4Now in November. By Christmas the pair were being written up as the latest virtual millionaires. Three months on, it is all beginning to seem old hat. 'Still,' says MacLeod, 'three months is a very long time in internet years.'</p> <p>Doshi, who projects an evangelical self-confidence, is fond of suggesting that a successful internet startup needs only three things 'a suit, an idea and a geek'. In the case of Liv4now.com, she happily takes on the first role - a 26-year-old chartered accountant with investment banking experience - while MacLeod, 22, performs the latter - he was working for AOL and Virgin.net while still at school. In person, the stereotypes blur a little; she is an unstructured suit, he an unusually personable geek.</p> <p>Their idea - now worth upwards of \u00a320 million - came as a result of a chance meeting. One day in August 1998 Doshi's computer printer broke down, and a friend suggested that MacLeod would be a good person to fix it. They got talking, and decided that the problem with the internet was that there was not enough on it for people like them: 'people who like to hang out, socialise and network... You could go online and buy a book but there was nowhere just to chill out with friends.' Though not exactly a eureka moment, they went away and thought some more. MacLeod, who grew up mostly in Essex but has not lost his reserved Scots accent, had some experience in virtual chilling: he had set up an online 'community' for students when the first internet possibilities opened up seven years ago.</p> <p>'I can remember people saying \"this Netscape thing is never going to take off,\"' he says now, having the last laugh. 'It was a totally text-based community, the kind of thing I would show my mum, and she'd say: \"Yes dear, I'm sure it's very interesting.\"' Doshi, meanwhile, had been working on a big internet sell-off for her bank, Schroders, in the US. 'It was,' she says, 'just before the hype started in this country,' but in the US it was clear she had seen what looked seductively like the future.</p> <p>In the 18 months since, the pair have sketched out a classic late-Nineties trajectory of wealth creation: they put together a demo website; raised some venture capital (the valuation we have placed on the business is based on both the market value analysts are now placing on sites like this one which attract high-spending people with disposable income and the discussions with venture capitalists looking to invest in the company); and thought of a name, which was also a kind of mission statement. 'Liv4now,' says Doshi, bright-eyed, 'is an attitude that will never die.' Then, in case I'd missed her point: 'You know, carpe diem. Liv4now is very much how to make your lifestyle the best it possibly can be.'</p> <p>These people are, they say, defined not by demographics but by a state of mind. There are, explains Doshi, 'a whole group of words that attach themselves to our users - hedonistic, aspirational, ambitious, wired, net-savvy.' And there are 40,000 of these dynamic individuals signing up to seize the day every month. Listening to Doshi and MacLeod talking about 'revenue streams' and 'sustainable business models' and 'scalability' you find yourself wondering what exactly it is that is making them all their (virtual) money. In fact it is, it seems, easier to say what Liv4Now is not than what it is: it's not a portal ('Yahoo!, for example,' Doshi explains patiently, 'is a portal'); it's not a magazine or a newspaper ('we don't tell our subscribers what to think'); it's not a dating agency or a vanity publisher - though it has elements of all of these things. It's rather, Doshi and MacLeod repeat, using the Blairites' favourite word like a mantra, a 'community' of hedonists (the kind of new-style hedonists, presumably, such as these two founder members who sip Diet Coke and work online hours).</p> <p>In their short time as e-pioneers, Doshi and MacLeod seem to have quickly acquired some of the paranoia of more conventional business people. Though they stress that their company is 'a lifestyle thing', they are oddly reluctant to reveal details of their own lives, to the extent that we have a couple of comical exchanges. When I ask, for example, what schools they went to, Doshi reacts as if I'd asked her to share her innermost secrets. 'Does it matter? Should it matter?' she demands.</p> <p>Not really, I suggest, except that it's interesting, given the meritocratic potential of the net, that the people making money seem to be mostly from traditional moneyed backgrounds.</p> <p>'I don't think it's relevant at all in this sphere,' Doshi argues. 'I think you can typify a lot of people who have seen there's a gold rush here and thought \"let's get in on this\". But we started this way back in 1998...'</p> <p>So you went to a comprehensive school then? 'I don't think it's relevant at all to what we're doing.' So, public school?</p> <p>'I've read those articles as well. But I think there are all sorts of people working in this business - people in garages - and it's entirely irrelevant where you went to school.'</p> <p>Later, when I suggest that I imagine that the community is good for singles, a kind of Club 18-30 without wet T-shirt competitions, Doshi gets more exasperated. 'It's not about dating,' she insists. 'It's about interacting. On other sites I think there could be a lot of that [dating] going on, but we have \"moderated chat\", live people in there hosting certain debates, which adds a safety aspect, as opposed to some other sites in which you can say just anything.' So how much of this policing is required? 'We don't really think of it as policing, it's moderation.'</p> <p>The current message boards discuss everything from the Lawrence inquiry to share tips; there are word association games played over a number of days, presumably by Liv4Now members who don't get out much ('mango\u0085 banana\u0085 strawberry\u0085 lychee\u0085' and so on) and hot topics, such as 'masturbation: how many times a day is normal?'</p> <p>Doshi and MacLeod are, of course, resolutely living for now, but they have big plans for the future: Liv4Now, the wireless community, 'so you'll be able to access the community via your mobile phone'; a community consultancy, advising companies how to become interactive; and 'spin-offs such as Liv4Football'.</p> <p>'I may have these noughts attached to my name in the papers,' says MacLeod smiling, 'but I only have \u00a34.50 in my pocket' - a point he proves when we scrabble to get the collective funds together to pay for our round of Diet Cokes.</p> <p>23. <b>John Bennett</b>, 25</p> <p>Software supplier. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>Last year we described Bennett as the most wealthy self-made law student in the UK. By the summer he had turned his back on the law and returned to the fold of the family business for what has to be one of the weirdest reasons ever given for dropping out of college - his 'passion' for improving customer service.</p> <p>He has joined an offshoot of the family's core interests - the internet venture Jungle.com - which sells music, videos and computer software on the net. The company began trading last August and he swapped the law for a position as Jungle's customer services director.</p> <p>Jungle.com is the new kid on the block in terms of the family's interests: Software Warehouse, of which Bennett is a director and shareholder, was started by his older brother in 1991, and had a turnover last year of \u00a380m. But Bennett's wealth will go through the roof if, as expected, jungle.com is floated on the stock market. A provisional value of \u00a3700m has been put on the business.</p> <p>24. <b>James Corsellis</b>, 29</p> <p>Founder, icollector. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>An overnight success that took six years. In 1994 Corsellis scraped together \u00a32,000 from family and friends to start a website, icollector, for culture vultures too busy to get to showrooms.</p> <p>Those close to the then 23-year-old could be forgiven for thinking that this was just another one of his false starts. Before finally graduating in modern history at Queen Mary's College, London, he failed to finish degrees at the Sorbonne and Oxford Polytechnic.</p> <p>He now owns an online auction service, which sells everything from Picasso prints to Elvis's army issue pants to a first edition of Ian Fleming's Goldfinger which sold for \u00a3750. However he spent four years knocking on auctioneers' doors trying to persuade them that this was not the most ridiculous idea they had ever heard. 'These organisations are traditional by nature,' says Corsellis. 'At first we only got the smaller and medium-sized houses like Philips to use us. It was only last year that the big houses like Christie's and Sotheby's came in.'</p> <p>It was on the promise of the big houses joining that large investors began to sit up. Between spring 1998 and last August Bernard Arnault, chairman of the luxury goods manufacturer LVMH, and investment banks Lehman Brothers and Shroders, pumped \u00a315m into the company.</p> <p>Arnault must be particularly happy with his investment: when he bought into the company, its shares were trading on Ofex - the exchange that allows people to trade in non-listed companies - at \u00a32 each. They are now trading at just under \u00a311 and the company is valued at \u00a382m. Corsellis owns 10 per cent of the shares.</p> <p>25. <b>Demis Hassabis</b>, 24</p> <p>Computer games developer. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>For Hassabis, it will take another 12 months before he knows if the last two years of his life have been wasted. Thirteen months ago computer games firm Eidos, which created the bestselling Tomb Raider series featuring the Lara Croft character, bought a five per cent stake in Hassabis's company Elixir for \u00a3600,000, valuing the company at \u00a312m. This bought Eidos the right to distribute the company's first three titles. The first, Republic: The Revolution, is released at the end of this year.</p> <p>Eidos was keen to do the deal because, aged 17, Hassabis helped to write a game called Theme Park which sold 3.5m copies worldwide, grossing \u00a350m. The game is regarded as a classic but he saw little of the income. This time it will be different. Hassabis says he doesn't mind that all eyes are on him: 'I like the pressure. It comes with the territory. If I'm not creating anticipation then something is wrong. I want Republic to be the best game ever.'</p> <p>Hassabis owns about 66 per cent of Elixir, giving him a stake worth \u00a38m in the company he founded with Cambridge friend Dave Silver.</p> <p>Hassabis ticks off most of the wunderkind boxes. A chess champion at 12, A-levels at 16, and a double first at Cambridge in computer science. Hassabis, who has a Greek Cypriot father and a mother from Singapore, bought his first computer at seven from winnings he saved from chess tournaments.</p> <p>He is also a non-executive director of Immersive Education, which takes educational packages and gives them the production treatments of a commercial game. The Londoner is a devotee of eastern culture. 'The Japanese have this idea of continual improvement. Always trying to be the best you can be. I like that.'</p> <p>26. <b>Avneet Kaur Sahni</b>, 29</p> <p>Computer retailer. \u00a36.5 million.</p> <p>Avneet Kaur Sahni has taken being 'publicity-shy' and turned it into an art form. We know that she married into the Sahni family computer sales business, VIP Computers, and became the third person to join the board of the Manchester-based company soon after that marriage - to Jitender Sahni in 1993. She has a 25 per cent stake in the company, which is valued at \u00a326m. Her stake is worth \u00a36.5m. The company was started only 10 years ago by Jitender's father Kartar. The firm sells cut-price computers to business users and has grown consistently over this period. In 1997 turnover was \u00a372m, in 1998 it was \u00a384m and last year the company claims that this rose to \u00a396m. Her father-in-law Kartar decided to take a back seat in 1995 and resigned from the board, leaving his son and daughter-in-law in charge.</p> <p>27. <b>Steven Walker</b>, 30</p> <p>Yorkshire pudding manufacturer. \u00a36.5 million.</p> <p>This year Walker turned his attention from the main course to the dessert. His Roberts Group, which makes Yorkshire puddings, branched out into fresh fruit desserts. Sweets are where the money is, apparently.</p> <p>'We make traditional desserts like bread-and-butter pudding or summer-fruits puddings,' says Walker without a hint of irony. 'We are the new kids on the block, but we are not doing badly.'</p> <p>But what has been difficult for the Mancunian is cancelling a flotation planned within the next two years. 'The market is really only interested in internet companies at the moment,' he says. 'If you are not an internet company you need to have a valuation of around \u00a3300m before investors will look at you. It's disappointing because a lot of these internet businesses do not have the solid foundations that we have.'</p> <p>And he is not talking bread-and-butter pudding. After an earlier \u00a33m refit of his three factories in Yorkshire the investment is beginning to pay off. Turnover is up 50 per cent on last year to \u00a329m. The company is valued at \u00a320m and as Walker owns 29 per cent of the company, his stake is worth just over \u00a36.5m.</p> <p>Walker is pleased with the progress. When he joined the business in 1993 the turnover was \u00a31m. He quit stockbrokers BWD Securities where he had worked for six years to join Roberts Yorkshire Kitchens which last year merged with Nordale Foods to form the Roberts Group.</p> <p>He says, 'This business might not be as sexy as some technology companies, but food always sells.' Walker, a bachelor, has houses in Leeds, Manchester and a chalet in the Welsh countryside. One of his most treasured possessions is his Manchester United season ticket.</p> <p>28. <b>Becky Lancashire</b>, 30</p> <p>Co-founder, Clickmusic.com. \u00a35 million.</p> <p>Becky Lancashire was the sort of girl who sat at the front of class with a spare set of pencils. 'Work has always been pretty central in my life,' she says. 'Even from my O-levels, if there was a choice between going to the pub and finishing off work, I would be the one who stayed home. '</p> <p>That makes it even more surprising that Lancashire should have found herself at the centre of a love affair that ended with her partner Robert Devereux, 44, walking out on his wife and four children after 13 years of marriage. Devereux was head of Virgin's media and music divisions when Lancashire joined the company in 1996 as head of corporate development. Within months, the two began an affair. Things were further complicated because Devereux's wife Vanessa is Richard Branson's youngest sister.</p> <p>Lancashire says: 'That was very tough for all concerned. But we love each other very much. There was no question of us not staying together.' Since last April Lancashire and Devereux have also been business partners in music information site Clickmusic.com, one of the most competitive sections of the internet business. Relations with Branson have been patched up. In January, Branson was one of a number of high-profile investors who put \u00a31m into Clickmusic. The venture is now valued at \u00a320m, with managing director Lancashire and chairman Devereux holding half of the shares.</p> <p>'Two hundred singles are released a week in Britain, and on top of that there are roughly five million music-related websites in the world. We tell you where is the best place to see, hear, buy, or read about, the type of music you are into,' says Lancashire. It is not clear where she got her business drive from because her family own an art gallery in London called Artmonsky Arts. She studied economics at Cambridge and then joined Chase Manhattan Bank as an investment banker.</p> <p>She swapped the bank for Branson because she wanted to work in a more entrepreneurial environment, and put together \u00a378m worth of financing to enable Branson to set up his V2 record label. When Capital Radio threatened to buy Virgin Radio for \u00a387.5m, new ventures dried up. At that point Devereux and Lancashire left to start their internet business.</p> <p>29. <b>Emily Spencer</b>, 28</p> <p>Founder, Whatsonwhen.com. \u00a33.6 million.</p> <p>If her career had not been derailed, Emily Spencer would be earning \u00a320,000 per year as a trade press journalist. Instead her plans went awry and now she is sitting on a sizeable pile of virtual money.</p> <p>It all began when she left Oxford university in 1994 with dreams of being a journalist. First stop was the offices of the finance magazine Euromoney. But soon she was freelancing at Virgin.net, before setting up a travel section for United News and Media's website, LineOne.</p> <p>And, as with so many good luck stories, this is when she spotted that gap in the market. 'There was no site that covered the world's must-see events, like the Rio Carnival, or bizarre events, and linked them to travel - not even in the US. From my own experience I realised that events drive travel transactions, the Star Wars premiere in New York being the perfect example.'</p> <p>A bit more time and experience gave birth to Whatsonwhen - the first global events directory on the internet. It was conceived in February 1999 and nurtured in a friend's living room in London's Soho. Spencer then set about recruiting friends from Oxford and the company relocated to Brick Lane in east London.</p> <p>'Working for yourself is much more rewarding', says Spencer, 'but it's much tougher because you cannot leave the work at the office. The biggest fear is failure - you would only blame yourself.'</p> <p>Private investors provided seed capital for the venture. A second round of funding from two venture capitalists, Botts and EEP, was negotiated three weeks ago, valuing the company at \u00a38m. Spencer has retained 45 per cent. She can comfort herself that if it all fails, she can always return to journalism.</p> <p>30, 31 and 32. <b>Daniel Gestetner</b>, 29; <b>Leo Gestetner</b>, 27; <b>Martin Reeves</b>, 25</p> <p>Founders, Shopsmart.com. \u00a33.3 million each.</p> <p>From inventions for the printing industry to the worldwide web within four generations. If the Gestetner name is familiar, it is because over the past 110 years it has been attached to all sorts of technical developments in the printing world. Ironic then that, having sold the family photocopying empire for \u00a3179m in 1996, the family is now dabbling in a medium which some predict will eventually bring to an end the printed word.</p> <p>The trio came together because the brothers were developing an idea to create a web business that collated the prices of products on the internet together for easy comparison. However, after a little investigation they found that Reeves had got there first. The brothers, as the saying goes, made him an offer he couldn't refuse. He had the idea but they had the money and contacts. 'I was,' says Reeves, 'at the right place at the right time.' The trio found that they could work together, and set up a new company, Shopsmart.</p> <p>Thomas Teichman, chairman of venture capitalist firm New Media Investors, in a joint deal with Durlacher, has invested \u00a31m for just under 10 per cent of Shopsmart. He says: 'The brothers are the dealmakers. They are the ones we talk to most. Reeves concerns himself with the technical side.'</p> <p>Last November the company bought its only serious rival, Enterprise City, for an undisclosed sum. In the spring, Shopsmart plans to launch local versions of its service in Germany, France and Sweden. The brothers have invested money via one of the family trusts; the trust is the direct owner of the 50 per cent stake they hold in Shopsmart. Reeves owns a further 25 per cent of the company, although he admits: 'to be honest I'm not actually sure how much I own at the moment, because there are so many deals being done. To get where I am is a case of being at the right place at the right time.'</p> <p>Both brothers are married and live in London. Reeves, who lists his hobbies as 'sleeping and business dinners', is single - perhaps not surprising with hobbies like that. As with other people on this list who are beneficiaries of large trusts or family monies, we have based the valuation of the Gestetner brothers solely on their stake in Shopsmart. Undoubtedly both have considerably more wealth than \u00a33.3m each but the trusts are held offshore and their size impossible to determine.</p>",

Later, when I suggest that I imagine that the community is good for singles, a kind of Club 18-30 without wet T-shirt competitions, Doshi gets more exasperated. 'It's not about dating,' she insists. 'It's about interacting. On other sites I think there could be a lot of that [dating] going on, but we have \"moderated chat\", live people in there hosting certain debates, which adds a safety aspect, as opposed to some other sites in which you can say just anything.' So how much of this policing is required? 'We don't really think of it as policing, it's moderation.' The current message boards discuss everything from the Lawrence inquiry to share tips; there are word association games played over a number of days, presumably by Liv4Now members who don't get out much ('mango\u0085 banana\u0085 strawberry\u0085 lychee\u0085' and so on) and hot topics, such as 'masturbation: how many times a day is normal?' Doshi and MacLeod are, of course, resolutely living for now, but they have big plans for the future: Liv4Now, the wireless community, 'so you'll be able to access the community via your mobile phone'; a community consultancy, advising companies how to become interactive; and 'spin-offs such as Liv4Football'. 'I may have these noughts attached to my name in the papers,' says MacLeod smiling, 'but I only have \u00a34.50 in my pocket' - a point he proves when we scrabble to get the collective funds together to pay for our round of Diet Cokes. 23. John Bennett, 25 Software supplier. \u00a38 million. Last year we described Bennett as the most wealthy self-made law student in the UK. By the summer he had turned his back on the law and returned to the fold of the family business for what has to be one of the weirdest reasons ever given for dropping out of college - his 'passion' for improving customer service. He has joined an offshoot of the family's core interests - the internet venture Jungle.com - which sells music, videos and computer software on the net. The company began trading last August and he swapped the law for a position as Jungle's customer services director. Jungle.com is the new kid on the block in terms of the family's interests: Software Warehouse, of which Bennett is a director and shareholder, was started by his older brother in 1991, and had a turnover last year of \u00a380m. But Bennett's wealth will go through the roof if, as expected, jungle.com is floated on the stock market. A provisional value of \u00a3700m has been put on the business. 24. James Corsellis, 29 Founder, icollector. \u00a38 million. An overnight success that took six years. In 1994 Corsellis scraped together \u00a32,000 from family and friends to start a website, icollector, for culture vultures too busy to get to showrooms. Those close to the then 23-year-old could be forgiven for thinking that this was just another one of his false starts. Before finally graduating in modern history at Queen Mary's College, London, he failed to finish degrees at the Sorbonne and Oxford Polytechnic. He now owns an online auction service, which sells everything from Picasso prints to Elvis's army issue pants to a first edition of Ian Fleming's Goldfinger which sold for \u00a3750. However he spent four years knocking on auctioneers' doors trying to persuade them that this was not the most ridiculous idea they had ever heard. 'These organisations are traditional by nature,' says Corsellis. 'At first we only got the smaller and medium-sized houses like Philips to use us. It was only last year that the big houses like Christie's and Sotheby's came in.' It was on the promise of the big houses joining that large investors began to sit up. Between spring 1998 and last August Bernard Arnault, chairman of the luxury goods manufacturer LVMH, and investment banks Lehman Brothers and Shroders, pumped \u00a315m into the company. Arnault must be particularly happy with his investment: when he bought into the company, its shares were trading on Ofex - the exchange that allows people to trade in non-listed companies - at \u00a32 each. They are now trading at just under \u00a311 and the company is valued at \u00a382m. Corsellis owns 10 per cent of the shares. 25. Demis Hassabis, 24 Computer games developer. \u00a38 million. For Hassabis, it will take another 12 months before he knows if the last two years of his life have been wasted. Thirteen months ago computer games firm Eidos, which created the bestselling Tomb Raider series featuring the Lara Croft character, bought a five per cent stake in Hassabis's company Elixir for \u00a3600,000, valuing the company at \u00a312m. This bought Eidos the right to distribute the company's first three titles. The first, Republic: The Revolution, is released at the end of this year. Eidos was keen to do the deal because, aged 17, Hassabis helped to write a game called Theme Park which sold 3.5m copies worldwide, grossing \u00a350m. The game is regarded as a classic but he saw little of the income. This time it will be different. Hassabis says he doesn't mind that all eyes are on him: 'I like the pressure. It comes with the territory. If I'm not creating anticipation then something is wrong. I want Republic to be the best game ever.' Hassabis owns about 66 per cent of Elixir, giving him a stake worth \u00a38m in the company he founded with Cambridge friend Dave Silver. Hassabis ticks off most of the wunderkind boxes. A chess champion at 12, A-levels at 16, and a double first at Cambridge in computer science. Hassabis, who has a Greek Cypriot father and a mother from Singapore, bought his first computer at seven from winnings he saved from chess tournaments. He is also a non-executive director of Immersive Education, which takes educational packages and gives them the production treatments of a commercial game. The Londoner is a devotee of eastern culture. 'The Japanese have this idea of continual improvement. Always trying to be the best you can be. I like that.' 26. Avneet Kaur Sahni, 29 Computer retailer. \u00a36.5 million. Avneet Kaur Sahni has taken being 'publicity-shy' and turned it into an art form. We know that she married into the Sahni family computer sales business, VIP Computers, and became the third person to join the board of the Manchester-based company soon after that marriage - to Jitender Sahni in 1993. She has a 25 per cent stake in the company, which is valued at \u00a326m. Her stake is worth \u00a36.5m. The company was started only 10 years ago by Jitender's father Kartar. The firm sells cut-price computers to business users and has grown consistently over this period. In 1997 turnover was \u00a372m, in 1998 it was \u00a384m and last year the company claims that this rose to \u00a396m. Her father-in-law Kartar decided to take a back seat in 1995 and resigned from the board, leaving his son and daughter-in-law in charge. 27. Steven Walker, 30 Yorkshire pudding manufacturer. \u00a36.5 million. This year Walker turned his attention from the main course to the dessert. His Roberts Group, which makes Yorkshire puddings, branched out into fresh fruit desserts. Sweets are where the money is, apparently. 'We make traditional desserts like bread-and-butter pudding or summer-fruits puddings,' says Walker without a hint of irony. 'We are the new kids on the block, but we are not doing badly.' But what has been difficult for the Mancunian is cancelling a flotation planned within the next two years. 'The market is really only interested in internet companies at the moment,' he says. 'If you are not an internet company you need to have a valuation of around \u00a3300m before investors will look at you. It's disappointing because a lot of these internet businesses do not have the solid foundations that we have.' And he is not talking bread-and-butter pudding. After an earlier \u00a33m refit of his three factories in Yorkshire the investment is beginning to pay off. Turnover is up 50 per cent on last year to \u00a329m. The company is valued at \u00a320m and as Walker owns 29 per cent of the company, his stake is worth just over \u00a36.5m. Walker is pleased with the progress. When he joined the business in 1993 the turnover was \u00a31m. He quit stockbrokers BWD Securities where he had worked for six years to join Roberts Yorkshire Kitchens which last year merged with Nordale Foods to form the Roberts Group. He says, 'This business might not be as sexy as some technology companies, but food always sells.' Walker, a bachelor, has houses in Leeds, Manchester and a chalet in the Welsh countryside. One of his most treasured possessions is his Manchester United season ticket. 28. Becky Lancashire, 30 Co-founder, Clickmusic.com. \u00a35 million. Becky Lancashire was the sort of girl who sat at the front of class with a spare set of pencils. 'Work has always been pretty central in my life,' she says. 'Even from my O-levels, if there was a choice between going to the pub and finishing off work, I would be the one who stayed home. ' That makes it even more surprising that Lancashire should have found herself at the centre of a love affair that ended with her partner Robert Devereux, 44, walking out on his wife and four children after 13 years of marriage. Devereux was head of Virgin's media and music divisions when Lancashire joined the company in 1996 as head of corporate development. Within months, the two began an affair. Things were further complicated because Devereux's wife Vanessa is Richard Branson's youngest sister. Lancashire says: 'That was very tough for all concerned. But we love each other very much. There was no question of us not staying together.' Since last April Lancashire and Devereux have also been business partners in music information site Clickmusic.com, one of the most competitive sections of the internet business. Relations with Branson have been patched up. In January, Branson was one of a number of high-profile investors who put \u00a31m into Clickmusic. The venture is now valued at \u00a320m, with managing director Lancashire and chairman Devereux holding half of the shares. 'Two hundred singles are released a week in Britain, and on top of that there are roughly five million music-related websites in the world. We tell you where is the best place to see, hear, buy, or read about, the type of music you are into,' says Lancashire. It is not clear where she got her business drive from because her family own an art gallery in London called Artmonsky Arts. She studied economics at Cambridge and then joined Chase Manhattan Bank as an investment banker. She swapped the bank for Branson because she wanted to work in a more entrepreneurial environment, and put together \u00a378m worth of financing to enable Branson to set up his V2 record label. When Capital Radio threatened to buy Virgin Radio for \u00a387.5m, new ventures dried up. At that point Devereux and Lancashire left to start their internet business. 29. Emily Spencer, 28 Founder, Whatsonwhen.com. \u00a33.6 million. If her career had not been derailed, Emily Spencer would be earning \u00a320,000 per year as a trade press journalist. Instead her plans went awry and now she is sitting on a sizeable pile of virtual money. It all began when she left Oxford university in 1994 with dreams of being a journalist. First stop was the offices of the finance magazine Euromoney. But soon she was freelancing at Virgin.net, before setting up a travel section for United News and Media's website, LineOne. And, as with so many good luck stories, this is when she spotted that gap in the market. 'There was no site that covered the world's must-see events, like the Rio Carnival, or bizarre events, and linked them to travel - not even in the US. From my own experience I realised that events drive travel transactions, the Star Wars premiere in New York being the perfect example.' A bit more time and experience gave birth to Whatsonwhen - the first global events directory on the internet. It was conceived in February 1999 and nurtured in a friend's living room in London's Soho. Spencer then set about recruiting friends from Oxford and the company relocated to Brick Lane in east London. 'Working for yourself is much more rewarding', says Spencer, 'but it's much tougher because you cannot leave the work at the office. The biggest fear is failure - you would only blame yourself.' Private investors provided seed capital for the venture. A second round of funding from two venture capitalists, Botts and EEP, was negotiated three weeks ago, valuing the company at \u00a38m. Spencer has retained 45 per cent. She can comfort herself that if it all fails, she can always return to journalism. 30, 31 and 32. Daniel Gestetner, 29; Leo Gestetner, 27; Martin Reeves, 25 Founders, Shopsmart.com. \u00a33.3 million each. From inventions for the printing industry to the worldwide web within four generations. If the Gestetner name is familiar, it is because over the past 110 years it has been attached to all sorts of technical developments in the printing world. Ironic then that, having sold the family photocopying empire for \u00a3179m in 1996, the family is now dabbling in a medium which some predict will eventually bring to an end the printed word. The trio came together because the brothers were developing an idea to create a web business that collated the prices of products on the internet together for easy comparison. However, after a little investigation they found that Reeves had got there first. The brothers, as the saying goes, made him an offer he couldn't refuse. He had the idea but they had the money and contacts. 'I was,' says Reeves, 'at the right place at the right time.' The trio found that they could work together, and set up a new company, Shopsmart. Thomas Teichman, chairman of venture capitalist firm New Media Investors, in a joint deal with Durlacher, has invested \u00a31m for just under 10 per cent of Shopsmart. He says: 'The brothers are the dealmakers. They are the ones we talk to most. Reeves concerns himself with the technical side.' Last November the company bought its only serious rival, Enterprise City, for an undisclosed sum. In the spring, Shopsmart plans to launch local versions of its service in Germany, France and Sweden. The brothers have invested money via one of the family trusts; the trust is the direct owner of the 50 per cent stake they hold in Shopsmart. Reeves owns a further 25 per cent of the company, although he admits: 'to be honest I'm not actually sure how much I own at the moment, because there are so many deals being done. To get where I am is a case of being at the right place at the right time.' Both brothers are married and live in London. Reeves, who lists his hobbies as 'sleeping and business dinners', is single - perhaps not surprising with hobbies like that. As with other people on this list who are beneficiaries of large trusts or family monies, we have based the valuation of the Gestetner brothers solely on their stake in Shopsmart. Undoubtedly both have considerably more wealth than \u00a33.3m each but the trusts are held offshore and their size impossible to determine.",

The list of young British moneymakers silently shouts the truth - that in spite of the warmer climate of race relations in Britain, we still aren't making it. It would be easy to say that this is yet another example of institutional racism in the business world; but since the colour that matters most to business people is green, and there are so many young Asian entrepreneurs on the list, this surely can't be the whole answer. </p> <p>Most of the list have made their fortunes at the end of an internet link, where no one can see your colour or hear your voice, so racism among the customers doesn't quite wash either.</p> <p>The normal explanation for black failure in business usually lies in three areas: educational under-achievement, discrimination by lenders and an absence of role models. All of these factors suggest why young black people would be at a disadvantage, but none convincingly explains their complete absence from the list.</p> <p>A combination of educational failure and discrimination is clearly responsible for there being relatively few black professionals. But since many successful entrepreneurs leave school early, it's unlikely to be a major factor in business. Prejudice on the part of financial institutions is. Stereotyped images of black people - lazy, less than competent, unreliable - mean that the trust and confidence needed to support a growing business is hard to come by. However, many Asian business people share the same disadvantages, and it is hard to believe that there are no bank managers or entrepreneurs who can see through the veil of prejudice.</p> <p>So what about the role models? Their absence may be a factor. But are we to believe that no black people see themselves as entrepreneurs because they don't have a high-profile example? We would all have to be astoundingly unambitious for this to be an explanation. And it still would not answer the question as to why it is that, even in fields where black people are hugely successful as performers, they never make the transition to mogul.</p> <p>Without wanting to take any of the focus off the issues of current discrimination, it may be that some of the reasons lie elsewhere, in the baleful legacy of the African and Caribbean colonial experience. One problem may be the domination of the Caribbean and African economies by foreign (including Asian) businesses. Typically, immigrant entrepreneurs have started by trading with their country of origin. But because black people were, unlike Indians, never permitted to set up businesses in the colonies, the relationships that many Asian entrepreneurs have depended on were never available. For example, while British Asian business people could buy textiles cheaply through family connections in India, Caribbean entrepreneurs would have to deal with British or American land owners if they wanted to exploit the tourist potential of the islands. </p> <p>But it's not all someone else's responsibility. Every black family is familiar with the expression \"get your paper first\". It is the traditional admonition to any child who expresses the desire to do something unconventional - get qualified in a solid profession. The idea of risk is abhorrent to many of the older generation - understandably so, since there were no welfare state cushions for failure in their young days. This attitude, as well as the strong, underlying Protestantism, has made the black British community a deeply conventional group of people. It may be that, at heart, we are a people too hidebound by our past to take the risks involved in making large amounts of money. Pile on top of that inclination the mountain of prejudice that any black entrepreneur has to face and ask yourself - is it worth taking the chance? For most of us, the answer has got to be no.</p> <p>\u0095 Trevor Phillips is a journalist and broadcaster, and deputy to Labour's London mayoral hopeful, Frank Dobson</p>",

But since many successful entrepreneurs leave school early, it's unlikely to be a major factor in business. Prejudice on the part of financial institutions is. Stereotyped images of black people - lazy, less than competent, unreliable - mean that the trust and confidence needed to support a growing business is hard to come by. However, many Asian business people share the same disadvantages, and it is hard to believe that there are no bank managers or entrepreneurs who can see through the veil of prejudice. So what about the role models? Their absence may be a factor. But are we to believe that no black people see themselves as entrepreneurs because they don't have a high-profile example? We would all have to be astoundingly unambitious for this to be an explanation. And it still would not answer the question as to why it is that, even in fields where black people are hugely successful as performers, they never make the transition to mogul. Without wanting to take any of the focus off the issues of current discrimination, it may be that some of the reasons lie elsewhere, in the baleful legacy of the African and Caribbean colonial experience. One problem may be the domination of the Caribbean and African economies by foreign (including Asian) businesses. Typically, immigrant entrepreneurs have started by trading with their country of origin. But because black people were, unlike Indians, never permitted to set up businesses in the colonies, the relationships that many Asian entrepreneurs have depended on were never available. For example, while British Asian business people could buy textiles cheaply through family connections in India, Caribbean entrepreneurs would have to deal with British or American land owners if they wanted to exploit the tourist potential of the islands. But it's not all someone else's responsibility. Every black family is familiar with the expression \"get your paper first\". It is the traditional admonition to any child who expresses the desire to do something unconventional - get qualified in a solid profession. The idea of risk is abhorrent to many of the older generation - understandably so, since there were no welfare state cushions for failure in their young days. This attitude, as well as the strong, underlying Protestantism, has made the black British community a deeply conventional group of people. It may be that, at heart, we are a people too hidebound by our past to take the risks involved in making large amounts of money. Pile on top of that inclination the mountain of prejudice that any black entrepreneur has to face and ask yourself - is it worth taking the chance? For most of us, the answer has got to be no. \u0095 Trevor Phillips is a journalist and broadcaster, and deputy to Labour's London mayoral hopeful, Frank Dobson",

He will inherit the family estate of about 14,000 acres in Norfolk worth \u00a343m, excluding development potential, an art collection worth over \u00a350m and some very well-endowed trusts. Fitzroy, whose father is the Earl of Euston, apparently put his time at Edinburgh university to use by brushing up on his guitar-playing skills.</p> <p><b>15 Lord Herbert, 22</b><br> Head of family: Earl of Pembroke<br> Will inherit \u00a390 million </p> <p>William Herbert will inherit an estate, consisting of 15,000 acres of Wiltshire (valued at \u00a32,900 per acre) and a valuable art treasure in the family home at Salisbury, from his father, filmmaker Henry Herbert.</p> <p> Some of the land, on the outskirts of Salisbury, has development potential, and at least 30 acres have been sold for development in the last 10 years. If only 0.5 per cent of the current estate is development land (worth \u00a3600,000 per acre in the area) then Herbert is sitting on an additional nest egg of \u00a345m. </p> <p><b>16 Lord Irwin, 23</b><br> Head of family: Earl of Halifax<br> Will inherit \u00a378 million </p> <p>The Earl of Halifax will hand over a 13,000 acre estate, racehorses and a valuable art collection to his son.

The great-grandfather of Lord Irwin, commonly known as Charles Woods, was secretary of state for foreign affairs when World War II broke out and served as the British ambassador in Washington. The valuation of Wood's inheritance is less than last year as the estate is smaller than originally thought.</p> <p><b>17 Thomas Orde-Powlett, 21</b><br> Head of family: Lord Bolton<br> Will inherit \u00a370 million </p> <p>The first Lord Bolton was granted his peerage in 1797, after marrying the daughter of the Duke of Bolton.

This land alone is worth \u00a33,350 per acre, according to the Inland Revenue, which values the estate at \u00a367m.

He has grown up surrounded by them: his mother was the daughter, sister and, of course, the wife of a duke, and his uncle is the Duke of Westminster - probably the richest man in England. Innes-Ker will inherit Floors Castle and 60,000 acres around the Cheviots and the River Tweed as well as hotels in the area. If half of the Roxburgh estate is farmland, it will have a market value of about \u00a366m (\u00a32,200 per acre). The remainder - mixed and hill country - is worth a further \u00a323m. Fishing rights will boost Innes-Ker's income significantly and the family art collection adds at least \u00a310m. 12 Viscount Weymouth, 26 Head of family: Marquess of Bath Will inherit \u00a3100 million Of all the families on this list, none has quite the profile of the owners of Longleat.

      "body": "<p>Their combined \u00a34.6bn fortune could buy enough Eurofighters to retake the House of Lords by force. But as most of them seem to have little interest in fighting for their family's place in the political system they are more likely to take the option of spending the money in other ways. There are those like Nathaniel Rothschild who is investing in new media and building a new branch of the family empire originally founded on banking. At the other extreme is Dan Macmillan - great-grandson of the former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan - a man who seems devoted to having a party.</p> <p>The list also reveals the wealthiest teenager in the UK - Luke Portman who, at 16, stands in line to inherit \u00a3850m, including a 100-acre chunk of central London.</p> <p>The Observer's list of the 30 richest heirs aged 16 to 30 has been trawled from an analysis of the top 100 inherited aristocratic fortunes in the UK. These valuations are based on the ownership of land and art treasures. On those occasions where we have evidence of money held in trusts we have included it in the valuation.</p> <p>But the nature - and purpose - of the trusts means that they are kept from public scrutiny. Using the recently published Inland Revenue Valuation Office Property Market Report it has been possible to make a more accurate assessment of the value of the land owned by these people. In some cases this has lead to changes in valuations since last year.</p> <p>Sources include: Inland Revenue Valuation Office Property Market Report autumn 1999, Great Landowners of Great Britain by Bateman, Vacher's Parliamentary Guide, The Treasure Houses of Great Britain, London Residential Research Ltd and Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage 2000.</p> <p><b>1 Hon Luke Oliver Berkeley Portman, 16</b><br> Head of family: Viscount Portman<br> Will inherit \u00a3850 million <br></p> <p>Luke Portman has now turned 16, and assumes his position at the head of our list. The Portmans, through their trust, Portman Settled Estates, own about 100 acres of land north of London's Oxford Street. Based on the latest research, by London Residential Research Ltd, the value of each square foot of this holding (at \u00a3400 per square foot it runs to 4.3m sq ft) is \u00a31.7bn. Because of the mix of leases and tenancies, which make up the estate, local estate agents suggest we take 50 per cent off the valuation to arrive at a figure of \u00a3850m.</p> <p>Luke Portman's father became head of the family after the death in May of his grandfather at his Caribbean hideaway on Antigua. It is likely that he too will become the main beneficiary of the estate at an early age since his father (Viscount Portman) inherited at the age of 11 for tax reasons.</p> <p><b>2 Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales, 18</b> <br> Head of family: HRH The Queen<br> Will inherit up to \u00a3700 million</p> <p>It is not just the hopes of the Royal Family resting on the shoulders of Prince William. There are several tabloid editors hoping that he will become as a big a circulation boost as his mother used to be. Tales of wild parties, friends linked to drugs and possible liaisons with everyone from Britney Spears to a string of debutantes, have kept the media happy.</p> <p>In financial terms, come the day he inherits, Prince William will receive the Duchy of Cornwall - a huge estate of 147,000 acres, mostly in the west of England. It produces an annual income of about \u00a36m for his father and is valued at \u00a3290m by the estate trustees. But the more accurate Inland Revenue Valuation Office figures for land in those counties, plus 30 or so acres in London, yields a figure closer to \u00a3700m.</p> <p>He also inherits many millions from Princess Diana, as well as being likely to inherit from his grandmother and his great-grandmother. Highgrove, Prince Charles's country house and estate, will also go to his eldest son, although the organic farming activities probably won't add much in terms of cash income. The experience of his father suggests that the son could have a long wait.</p> <p><b>3 Hon Nathaniel Philip Victor Rothschild, 29</b><br> Head of family: Lord Rothschild<br> Will inherit \u00a3500 million</p> <p>Described by his PR man as a 'shrinking violet', Rothschild junior is the place where old money meets new media. The eldest son of Lord Rothschild has inherited the family's financial acumen and has been made responsible for the family's increasing investment in everything 'net'.</p> <p>Along with the land and art trappings of most aristocrats, the Rothschilds are adding the internet and e-commerce to their empire. In the past four months the Rothschild family has bought an undisclosed stake in New Media Investors, a venture capital company which has pumped money into new media start-ups including lastminute.com.</p> <p>When New Media Investors floated on the Alternative Investment Market in November - after the Rothschilds had bought their stake - the company was valued at \u00a388m. There have been further investments: \u00a33m into the natural health website Clickmango (in conjunction with another venture capitalist); and, with Lord Weinstock, \u00a310m was poured into Star Technology. These investments have propelled Nathaniel Rothschild on to the boards of both New Media Investors and Star Technology to protect his family's interest. The link with New Media Investors came via a mutual friend - at a point when the company was expanding. 'He brings a wealth of contacts,' says a spokesman for NMI, who adds that the Rothschilds definitely 'intend to increase their exposure in this area'.</p> <p>But this is where he displayed his shrinking violet tendencies by declining to discuss the family's e-business interests with The Observer. After schooling at Eton and a history degree at Wadham College - where he was fined \u00a320 for driving a car without an MOT - he joined fund manager Lazard's, then went to work at Gleacher, the corporate finance firm now owned by NatWest. He currently occupies a variety of positions - and holds a 50 per cent stake - in NR Atticus, Atticus Management and Atticus Capital, a hedge fund, which controls funds approaching \u00a3312m.</p> <p>During his period in the City he found the time to meet and secretly marry Annabelle Neilson in Las Vegas in a rare show of impetuousness which ended in divorce. His father now describes him as 'an eligible bachelor'. But not a 'shrinking violet'.</p> <p>The Rothschild inheritance is difficult to quantify - not just because of the value of their internet interests. Nathaniel Rothschild will have to share his father's enormous wealth with his three older sisters. However his direct inheritance will include art, land, family companies and institutions plus his father's stake in Rothschild Continuation, the Swiss-based holding company for the Rothschild interests which has stakes in many of the family enterprises, including the bank NM Rothschild.</p> <p>His father has further stakes in three quoted companies: RIT Capital Partners, Value Realisation Trust and St James Place Capital. But behind this wealth there is the actual Rothschild family fortune hidden in a series of trusts in Switzerland and rumoured to be worth \u00a340bn. This will prove to be a conservative valuation of what Nathaniel Rothschild inherits, especially if some of the family's new media investments start to pay off.</p> <p><b> 4 Hon William Guy Vestey, 17</b><br> Head of family: Lord Vestey<br> Will inherit \u00a3340 million</p> <p>It was once said of the Vesteys that they lived 'not on the interest built up by their estate but on the interest of the interest'. In those terms life has come unstuck for the family since the collapse of the Vestey empire and the liquidation of the Dewhurst butchers' chain in 1995. But don't shed too many tears - the Vesteys were still left with an estimated \u00a3650m, at least half of which belongs to the father of William Guy Vestey. Additionally, they own the 5,000 acres of Stowell Park in Gloucestershire, which, at \u00a33,000 per acre, is valued at \u00a315m.</p> <p>In stark contrast to Vestey (who was Page of Honour to the Queen from 1995 to 1998 - which means he stood around and looked pretty), Mark Brown, his anarchist cousin, and the grandson of Sir Derek Vestey, was charged with masterminding the anti-capitalism march that turned violent in the City of London on June 18 last year.</p> <p><b>5 Earl Compton, 27</b> <br> Head of family: Marquess of Northampton <br> Will inherit \u00a3200 million</p> <p>Daniel Bingham, as he is known, has had more stepmothers than most, his father having married five times so far. But that will have little effect on his inheritance.</p> <p>Of more significance could be a legal judgment over ownership of the Sevso hoard of ancient Roman silver which is valued at \u00a340m. When the collection was put up for sale in New York in 1990 the authorities impounded it, and while the family won the legal battle over ownership, buyers have been discouraged as they might be hit later with a further legal challenge.</p> <p>The family owns 5,000 acres of Surrey, plus 25,000 acres in the Midlands, giving a total wealth of \u00a3100m in land alone. Aside from the Sevso hoard, Bingham's family has art treasures in both his stately homes, conservatively valued at \u00a3100m. But the huge legal costs in establishing ownership of the Sevso treasure - the Hungarian, Lebanese and Yugoslavian governments were among those contesting ownership - and the question over any future sale have lead us to reduce his valuation to \u00a3200m.</p> <p><b> 6 Hon Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 30 </b><br> Head of family: Marquess of Salisbury<br> Will inherit \u00a3200 million</p> <p>The Cecil family (pronounced like 'thistle', not 'vessel') has been a venerable Tory institution for centuries - during Queen Victoria's reign, one ancestor was three times a prime minister. Last year Robert Gascoyne-Cecil's father - Viscount Cranbourne, one of the more dynamic parents in this list - was sacked as Tory leader in the House of Lords after going over William Hague's head and negotiating the abolition of the hereditary peers directly with Tony Blair.</p> <p>Cranbourne is also a member of a group of Premier Oil shareholders attempting to oust the current management team due to Premier's floundering share price. Their proposals acknowledge the ethical issue of Premier's business in Burma but they propose to sell off the Burmese assets (as well as interests in Pakistan and Indonesia) for financial reasons and because they fear retribution if the Burmese regime falls.</p> <p>The family fortune consists of 3,000 acres in Dorset valued at \u00a39m, 10,000 acres in Hertfordshire worth a further \u00a328.6m plus an unknown quantity of land in London. Some of the Hertfordshire land is development land, worth, according to the Inland Revenue, \u00a3850,000 per acre. Treasures going back to Elizabethan times at Hatfield House, the family home, are valued at \u00a3100m and there are investments in various trusts. Cranbourne retains his seat in the House of Lords under the life peerage of Lord Gascoyne-Cecil.</p> <p><b>7 Viscount Macmillan, 26</b><br> Head of family: Earl of Stockton<br> Will inherit \u00a3200 million</p> <p>Dan Macmillan is the great-grandson of former Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan but is perhaps better known as Jade Jagger's intermittent boyfriend of two years. She last split up with him on New Year's Eve, citing his incessant nocturnal partying, which, for a Jagger to find excessive, must have been truly heroic.</p> <p>He has had a stab at modelling, acting, art and fashion design, establishing a clothing label, and is now pursuing an interest in photography. But he will not be following his father Alexander Stockton into the family publishing business. Stockton was quietly removed from the chairmanship in 1990 and is currently president - the family sold its majority stake (71 per cent) to German publisher Holtzbrinck back in 1995.</p> <p>Dan Macmillan grew up at Birch Grove, the family home in Sussex (house guests have included John F Kennedy and de Gaulle, but not in the younger Macmillan's memory). Rather, his global social life now revolves around Ibiza and Notting Hill. The family fortune comes in the form of cash from the remaining stake in the Macmillan Group plus a small estate in Devon and property in London.</p> <p><b>8 Viscount Lymington, 19</b><br> Head of family: Earl of Portsmouth<br> Will inherit \u00a3190 million</p> <p>Oliver Wallop's father is better known as one of those who bankrolled Neil Hamilton's failed libel action against Mohamed Al Fayed last December. In a move which suggests he enjoys giving away money to lawyers, Wallop senior also previously supported Count Nikolai Tolstoy's failed legal action in the Eighties.</p> <p>But it will be comforting to his son Oliver Henry Rufus, whose mother is the author Candia McWilliam, that there is plenty of money where the Hamilton and Tolstoy funds came from. The Earl is now married to Annabel Fergusson. The 19-year-old Wallop stands to inherit the family mansion and 3,000 acres near Basingstoke, as well as a stake in the Grainger Trust, his father's property company, and some very valuable art treasures. Based on his previous sales for development, we calculate that five per cent of the estate has development potential, fetching \u00a3143m, while the remaining 2,850 acres are worth \u00a38m.

      "bodyText": "Their combined \u00a34.6bn fortune could buy enough Eurofighters to retake the House of Lords by force. But as most of them seem to have little interest in fighting for their family's place in the political system they are more likely to take the option of spending the money in other ways. There are those like Nathaniel Rothschild who is investing in new media and building a new branch of the family empire originally founded on banking. At the other extreme is Dan Macmillan - great-grandson of the former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan - a man who seems devoted to having a party. The list also reveals the wealthiest teenager in the UK - Luke Portman who, at 16, stands in line to inherit \u00a3850m, including a 100-acre chunk of central London. The Observer's list of the 30 richest heirs aged 16 to 30 has been trawled from an analysis of the top 100 inherited aristocratic fortunes in the UK. These valuations are based on the ownership of land and art treasures. On those occasions where we have evidence of money held in trusts we have included it in the valuation. But the nature - and purpose - of the trusts means that they are kept from public scrutiny. Using the recently published Inland Revenue Valuation Office Property Market Report it has been possible to make a more accurate assessment of the value of the land owned by these people. In some cases this has lead to changes in valuations since last year. Sources include: Inland Revenue Valuation Office Property Market Report autumn 1999, Great Landowners of Great Britain by Bateman, Vacher's Parliamentary Guide, The Treasure Houses of Great Britain, London Residential Research Ltd and Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage 2000. 1 Hon Luke Oliver Berkeley Portman, 16 Head of family: Viscount Portman Will inherit \u00a3850 million Luke Portman has now turned 16, and assumes his position at the head of our list. The Portmans, through their trust, Portman Settled Estates, own about 100 acres of land north of London's Oxford Street. Based on the latest research, by London Residential Research Ltd, the value of each square foot of this holding (at \u00a3400 per square foot it runs to 4.3m sq ft) is \u00a31.7bn. Because of the mix of leases and tenancies, which make up the estate, local estate agents suggest we take 50 per cent off the valuation to arrive at a figure of \u00a3850m. Luke Portman's father became head of the family after the death in May of his grandfather at his Caribbean hideaway on Antigua. It is likely that he too will become the main beneficiary of the estate at an early age since his father (Viscount Portman) inherited at the age of 11 for tax reasons. 2 Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales, 18 Head of family: HRH The Queen Will inherit up to \u00a3700 million It is not just the hopes of the Royal Family resting on the shoulders of Prince William. There are several tabloid editors hoping that he will become as a big a circulation boost as his mother used to be. Tales of wild parties, friends linked to drugs and possible liaisons with everyone from Britney Spears to a string of debutantes, have kept the media happy. In financial terms, come the day he inherits, Prince William will receive the Duchy of Cornwall - a huge estate of 147,000 acres, mostly in the west of England. It produces an annual income of about \u00a36m for his father and is valued at \u00a3290m by the estate trustees. But the more accurate Inland Revenue Valuation Office figures for land in those counties, plus 30 or so acres in London, yields a figure closer to \u00a3700m. He also inherits many millions from Princess Diana, as well as being likely to inherit from his grandmother and his great-grandmother. Highgrove, Prince Charles's country house and estate, will also go to his eldest son, although the organic farming activities probably won't add much in terms of cash income. The experience of his father suggests that the son could have a long wait. 3 Hon Nathaniel Philip Victor Rothschild, 29 Head of family: Lord Rothschild Will inherit \u00a3500 million Described by his PR man as a 'shrinking violet', Rothschild junior is the place where old money meets new media. The eldest son of Lord Rothschild has inherited the family's financial acumen and has been made responsible for the family's increasing investment in everything 'net'. Along with the land and art trappings of most aristocrats, the Rothschilds are adding the internet and e-commerce to their empire. In the past four months the Rothschild family has bought an undisclosed stake in New Media Investors, a venture capital company which has pumped money into new media start-ups including lastminute.com. When New Media Investors floated on the Alternative Investment Market in November - after the Rothschilds had bought their stake - the company was valued at \u00a388m. There have been further investments: \u00a33m into the natural health website Clickmango (in conjunction with another venture capitalist); and, with Lord Weinstock, \u00a310m was poured into Star Technology. These investments have propelled Nathaniel Rothschild on to the boards of both New Media Investors and Star Technology to protect his family's interest. The link with New Media Investors came via a mutual friend - at a point when the company was expanding. 'He brings a wealth of contacts,' says a spokesman for NMI, who adds that the Rothschilds definitely 'intend to increase their exposure in this area'. But this is where he displayed his shrinking violet tendencies by declining to discuss the family's e-business interests with The Observer. After schooling at Eton and a history degree at Wadham College - where he was fined \u00a320 for driving a car without an MOT - he joined fund manager Lazard's, then went to work at Gleacher, the corporate finance firm now owned by NatWest. He currently occupies a variety of positions - and holds a 50 per cent stake - in NR Atticus, Atticus Management and Atticus Capital, a hedge fund, which controls funds approaching \u00a3312m. During his period in the City he found the time to meet and secretly marry Annabelle Neilson in Las Vegas in a rare show of impetuousness which ended in divorce. His father now describes him as 'an eligible bachelor'. But not a 'shrinking violet'. The Rothschild inheritance is difficult to quantify - not just because of the value of their internet interests. Nathaniel Rothschild will have to share his father's enormous wealth with his three older sisters. However his direct inheritance will include art, land, family companies and institutions plus his father's stake in Rothschild Continuation, the Swiss-based holding company for the Rothschild interests which has stakes in many of the family enterprises, including the bank NM Rothschild. His father has further stakes in three quoted companies: RIT Capital Partners, Value Realisation Trust and St James Place Capital. But behind this wealth there is the actual Rothschild family fortune hidden in a series of trusts in Switzerland and rumoured to be worth \u00a340bn. This will prove to be a conservative valuation of what Nathaniel Rothschild inherits, especially if some of the family's new media investments start to pay off. 4 Hon William Guy Vestey, 17 Head of family: Lord Vestey Will inherit \u00a3340 million It was once said of the Vesteys that they lived 'not on the interest built up by their estate but on the interest of the interest'. In those terms life has come unstuck for the family since the collapse of the Vestey empire and the liquidation of the Dewhurst butchers' chain in 1995. But don't shed too many tears - the Vesteys were still left with an estimated \u00a3650m, at least half of which belongs to the father of William Guy Vestey. Additionally, they own the 5,000 acres of Stowell Park in Gloucestershire, which, at \u00a33,000 per acre, is valued at \u00a315m. In stark contrast to Vestey (who was Page of Honour to the Queen from 1995 to 1998 - which means he stood around and looked pretty), Mark Brown, his anarchist cousin, and the grandson of Sir Derek Vestey, was charged with masterminding the anti-capitalism march that turned violent in the City of London on June 18 last year. 5 Earl Compton, 27 Head of family: Marquess of Northampton Will inherit \u00a3200 million Daniel Bingham, as he is known, has had more stepmothers than most, his father having married five times so far. But that will have little effect on his inheritance. Of more significance could be a legal judgment over ownership of the Sevso hoard of ancient Roman silver which is valued at \u00a340m. When the collection was put up for sale in New York in 1990 the authorities impounded it, and while the family won the legal battle over ownership, buyers have been discouraged as they might be hit later with a further legal challenge. The family owns 5,000 acres of Surrey, plus 25,000 acres in the Midlands, giving a total wealth of \u00a3100m in land alone. Aside from the Sevso hoard, Bingham's family has art treasures in both his stately homes, conservatively valued at \u00a3100m. But the huge legal costs in establishing ownership of the Sevso treasure - the Hungarian, Lebanese and Yugoslavian governments were among those contesting ownership - and the question over any future sale have lead us to reduce his valuation to \u00a3200m. 6 Hon Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 30 Head of family: Marquess of Salisbury Will inherit \u00a3200 million The Cecil family (pronounced like 'thistle', not 'vessel') has been a venerable Tory institution for centuries - during Queen Victoria's reign, one ancestor was three times a prime minister. Last year Robert Gascoyne-Cecil's father - Viscount Cranbourne, one of the more dynamic parents in this list - was sacked as Tory leader in the House of Lords after going over William Hague's head and negotiating the abolition of the hereditary peers directly with Tony Blair. Cranbourne is also a member of a group of Premier Oil shareholders attempting to oust the current management team due to Premier's floundering share price. Their proposals acknowledge the ethical issue of Premier's business in Burma but they propose to sell off the Burmese assets (as well as interests in Pakistan and Indonesia) for financial reasons and because they fear retribution if the Burmese regime falls. The family fortune consists of 3,000 acres in Dorset valued at \u00a39m, 10,000 acres in Hertfordshire worth a further \u00a328.6m plus an unknown quantity of land in London. Some of the Hertfordshire land is development land, worth, according to the Inland Revenue, \u00a3850,000 per acre. Treasures going back to Elizabethan times at Hatfield House, the family home, are valued at \u00a3100m and there are investments in various trusts. Cranbourne retains his seat in the House of Lords under the life peerage of Lord Gascoyne-Cecil. 7 Viscount Macmillan, 26 Head of family: Earl of Stockton Will inherit \u00a3200 million Dan Macmillan is the great-grandson of former Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan but is perhaps better known as Jade Jagger's intermittent boyfriend of two years. She last split up with him on New Year's Eve, citing his incessant nocturnal partying, which, for a Jagger to find excessive, must have been truly heroic. He has had a stab at modelling, acting, art and fashion design, establishing a clothing label, and is now pursuing an interest in photography. But he will not be following his father Alexander Stockton into the family publishing business. Stockton was quietly removed from the chairmanship in 1990 and is currently president - the family sold its majority stake (71 per cent) to German publisher Holtzbrinck back in 1995. Dan Macmillan grew up at Birch Grove, the family home in Sussex (house guests have included John F Kennedy and de Gaulle, but not in the younger Macmillan's memory). Rather, his global social life now revolves around Ibiza and Notting Hill. The family fortune comes in the form of cash from the remaining stake in the Macmillan Group plus a small estate in Devon and property in London. 8 Viscount Lymington, 19 Head of family: Earl of Portsmouth Will inherit \u00a3190 million Oliver Wallop's father is better known as one of those who bankrolled Neil Hamilton's failed libel action against Mohamed Al Fayed last December. In a move which suggests he enjoys giving away money to lawyers, Wallop senior also previously supported Count Nikolai Tolstoy's failed legal action in the Eighties. But it will be comforting to his son Oliver Henry Rufus, whose mother is the author Candia McWilliam, that there is plenty of money where the Hamilton and Tolstoy funds came from. The Earl is now married to Annabel Fergusson. The 19-year-old Wallop stands to inherit the family mansion and 3,000 acres near Basingstoke, as well as a stake in the Grainger Trust, his father's property company, and some very valuable art treasures. Based on his previous sales for development, we calculate that five per cent of the estate has development potential, fetching \u00a3143m, while the remaining 2,850 acres are worth \u00a38m. The family stake in the Grainger Trust is valued at \u00a312m, while their art treasures are valued in excess of \u00a330m. 9 Hon Jesse David Suenson-Taylor, 23 Head of family: Lord Grantchester Will inherit \u00a3176 million Suenson-Taylor's father is the third Lord Grantchester, a rare Labour peer who describes himself as a dairy farmer in Crewe, Cheshire, and is also chairman of a small milk producer, the South West Cheshire Dairy Association. His grandmother, the dowager Lady Grantchester, steered the Littlewoods organisation back on to an even keel after turbulence in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Suenson-Taylor, who maintains a low profile, will inherit an 11 per cent share of the \u00a31.6bn Littlewoods fortune - the basis for this year's valuation. His inheritance has not shrunk by \u00a364m since last year; we have just cleared up confusion over his stake in the Littlewoods family pot. 10 Hon William Boscawen, 21 Head of family: Viscount Falmouth Will inherit \u00a3150 million The history of the Boscawens goes back to 1264 and reaches the present via a string of beheadings and rebellions. Now the family are the largest landowners in Cornwall with an estate almost twice the size of Prince Charles's Cornish holdings, with 40,000 acres worth \u00a3117m. If just one per cent of the estate is development land (fetching \u00a3175,000 in the region), the value shoots up by a further \u00a370m - and the head of the family is well known for the number of planning applications he submits.

His brother's skills in the boxing ring have made the Hameds secure for the rest of their lives. But there is a growing impression that Prince Naseem has been sitting on his talent for several years and that he needs to be fighting better opponents - in some quarters Riath has been blamed for not exposing him to those riskier, but long-term, more lucrative fights.</p> <p>In his defence Riath has said: 'We won't be railroaded into wars.' He says he reluctantly took over control of his brother's business affairs in 1995 - his father had hopes of him becoming a lawyer or doctor - and became manager in 1998. Over the past five years he has been at the centre of negotiations, and fallen out, with most of boxing's big names and also been involved in the jettisoning from the Hamed camp of anyone who was not 'family'. First to go in 1998 was Brendan Ingle, his manager and trainer for 17 years, followed by Frank Warren a year later. The older Hamed is married with two children and lives on the outskirts of Sheffield near his more famous brother and their other seven brothers and sisters, most of whom work in the businesses which have grown out of Naseem's fame. Riath takes less than the traditional manager's 25 per cent. His valuation remains unchanged since last year largely because of the increasingly opaque nature of the Hamed family dealings.</p> <p>34. <b>Richard Russell</b>, 28</p> <p>Director, XL Recordings. \u00a33 million.</p> <p>Richard Russell remained resolutely silent when approached by The Observer. And indeed people within the dance music industry were equally reticent about talking about the 28-year old who has a 24 per cent stake in XL Recordings. Over the past five years XL has grown into the most successful independent dance-music label around. Its early success was built on the phenomenal worldwide success of the Prodigy.</p> <p>The success story was continued by Basement Jaxx who sold over 200,000 copies of their debut album last year. XL relies on the muscle of the Beggars Banquet Group - its ultimate holding company - for distribution and marketing. 1997 was an exceptionally successful year for XL with huge sales of the Prodigy's Fat of the Land.</p> <p>The label's most recent financial accounts, to the end of 1997, show that it posted a very healthy pre-tax profit of \u00a35.7m, and paid dividends of \u00a32m, of which Russell would have received about \u00a3500,000. The company's assets totalled \u00a36m. The Prodigy have a new album to be released this year - although there is speculation that it may be delayed -- but that will be a further boon to XL and Russell's earnings. On this basis we believe that XL has maintained momentum and profitability and, taking into account his stake in the company, we value Russell at \u00a33m. He clearly feels financially secure, having bought an undisclosed stake in a fellow entrepreneur's label, 25-year old James Lavelle's Mo' Wax.</p> <p>35 and 36. <b>Robert Norton</b>, 27 and <b>Toby Rowland</b>, 30</p> <p>Founders, Clickmango. \u00a32.5 million each.</p> <p>His father, who once owned The Observer, was described as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism' and that was by a former Tory prime minister. But Toby Rowland claims that the ease with which he and Robert Norton secured private funding - they raised \u00a33m within one week - had nothing to do with his famous late father, Tiny Rowland.</p> <p>If the story sounds unbelievable, it is a line supported by one of the investors in the company which hasn't even launched yet. 'I didn't know who Toby's father was when we first met,' says Rob Zegelaar of Atlas Venture. 'I am Dutch and after we had invested in them he told me about his father. I still didn't know who he was.'</p> <p>Norton and Rowland met at Oxford university but the business grew out of a telephone conversation last June. Norton, in Paris, was talking to Rowland in London. They both agreed to quit their jobs - Norton as development director of French internet company Nomad, and Rowland as a research director at Disneyand - to set up an online natural health business, Clickmango.</p> <p>By the end of their first day of meetings with venture capitalists they were offered \u00a31m. By the end of the week they accepted an offer from venture capitalists Atlas Venture and some family money from Lord Rothschild - a package worth \u00a33m. Atlas values the company at \u00a38m and Norton and Rowland hold 62 per cent - valuing their holding at \u00a35m. Norton came up with the idea and says he has 'slightly' more shares.</p> <p>We have included Rowland on the basis of his business interests. His overall wealth will be far in excess of \u00a32.5m because he is a major beneficiary of his father's \u00a3200m estate.</p> <p>37-40. <b>Peter Atalla</b>, 21 <b>Alan Edmondson</b>, 23 <b>John Boardman</b>, 22 and <b>Michael Haycock</b>, 23</p> <p>Founders, studentnet.com. \u00a32.2million each.</p> <p>It reads a little like a Young Ones sketch. Our four student heroes come up with an idea, sell the idea making millions of pounds, and within weeks are plastered all over The Sun because of their newfound wealth.</p> <p>Only in the case of these four it's true, and Alexei Sayle doesn't come in at the end, batter them, pinching both the idea and the money.</p> <p>Peter Atalla, a final-year Nottingham Trent university student, was brushing his teeth last summer - and rather than wondering who had left the top off the toothpaste - he started to think about the mechanics of moving house.</p> <p>He couldn't understand why there was no student website to provide information on available accommodation, as well as filling you in on what bands were in town, and other student news and gossip. After a talk with three of his closest friends at Trent - Haycock, Edmondson, and Boardman - they decided to set up a site of their own. The company studentnet.com was only incorporated last July. So while most people nurse a hangover the day after graduating, these four began building the site.</p> <p>Edmonson, who does the talking for the group says, 'Mike and I had planned to take a few months off to go to the west coast of America. But when we heard Peter's idea we cancelled it. We thought it was good and wanted to get on with it right away.'</p> <p>Nine months after Atalla came up with the idea - it is understood that he has a slightly larger stake than the others - the quartet share a paper worth of just under \u00a39m. In January the US-based media company International Media Products Group (IMPG) bought a 70 per cent stake in the company, ploughing experience, resources and \u00a31m in cash into the group. In return, the four ex-students picked up a five per cent stake in IMPG which is set to float on the American technology exchange Nasdaq this spring at an expected \u00a3150m.</p> <p>IMPG expects quick returns on its money. Its corporate development director Tunch Kashif explains: 'We look to invest in companies that can increase tenfold in the space of a year. This company made revenues of \u00a325,000 in their first three weeks. This is the sort of company we are interested in.' IMPG expects to reap a return of at least \u00a310m on its initial investment within the first year.</p> <p>Although all four men are in their early twenties, none are new to business. Haycock and Atalla both sold computer hardware before going to college. In his teens Boardman ran a mobile disco. At 14 Edmondson started a gardening service, cutting lawns, planting bulbs and trimming borders in his hometown, Doncaster, South Yorkshire.</p> <p>Studentnet.com is planning to cover around 60 major British student towns and cities before the end of the year. The company will then look to expand into Europe and the US. Without the IMPG money this would not be possible but the four directors may one day regret having had to sell so much of their company to get backing. This kind of growth means long hours and they usually work a seven-day week. This sort of schedule must be particularly gruelling for Atalla and Boardman who also live together.</p> <p>'Some people wonder whether we are happy working this hard,' says Edmondson. 'But there is plenty of time to do other things later. The bottom line is if we weren't happy we wouldn't be doing this.' Now that is something you would never have heard in the Young Ones.</p>",

His father, who once owned The Observer, was described as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism' and that was by a former Tory prime minister. But Toby Rowland claims that the ease with which he and Robert Norton secured private funding - they raised \u00a33m within one week - had nothing to do with his famous late father, Tiny Rowland. If the story sounds unbelievable, it is a line supported by one of the investors in the company which hasn't even launched yet. 'I didn't know who Toby's father was when we first met,' says Rob Zegelaar of Atlas Venture. 'I am Dutch and after we had invested in them he told me about his father. I still didn't know who he was.' Norton and Rowland met at Oxford university but the business grew out of a telephone conversation last June. Norton, in Paris, was talking to Rowland in London. They both agreed to quit their jobs - Norton as development director of French internet company Nomad, and Rowland as a research director at Disneyand - to set up an online natural health business, Clickmango. By the end of their first day of meetings with venture capitalists they were offered \u00a31m. By the end of the week they accepted an offer from venture capitalists Atlas Venture and some family money from Lord Rothschild - a package worth \u00a33m. Atlas values the company at \u00a38m and Norton and Rowland hold 62 per cent - valuing their holding at \u00a35m. Norton came up with the idea and says he has 'slightly' more shares. We have included Rowland on the basis of his business interests. His overall wealth will be far in excess of \u00a32.5m because he is a major beneficiary of his father's \u00a3200m estate. 37-40. Peter Atalla, 21 Alan Edmondson, 23 John Boardman, 22 and Michael Haycock, 23 Founders, studentnet.com. \u00a32.2million each. It reads a little like a Young Ones sketch. Our four student heroes come up with an idea, sell the idea making millions of pounds, and within weeks are plastered all over The Sun because of their newfound wealth. Only in the case of these four it's true, and Alexei Sayle doesn't come in at the end, batter them, pinching both the idea and the money. Peter Atalla, a final-year Nottingham Trent university student, was brushing his teeth last summer - and rather than wondering who had left the top off the toothpaste - he started to think about the mechanics of moving house. He couldn't understand why there was no student website to provide information on available accommodation, as well as filling you in on what bands were in town, and other student news and gossip. After a talk with three of his closest friends at Trent - Haycock, Edmondson, and Boardman - they decided to set up a site of their own. The company studentnet.com was only incorporated last July. So while most people nurse a hangover the day after graduating, these four began building the site. Edmonson, who does the talking for the group says, 'Mike and I had planned to take a few months off to go to the west coast of America. But when we heard Peter's idea we cancelled it. We thought it was good and wanted to get on with it right away.' Nine months after Atalla came up with the idea - it is understood that he has a slightly larger stake than the others - the quartet share a paper worth of just under \u00a39m. In January the US-based media company International Media Products Group (IMPG) bought a 70 per cent stake in the company, ploughing experience, resources and \u00a31m in cash into the group. In return, the four ex-students picked up a five per cent stake in IMPG which is set to float on the American technology exchange Nasdaq this spring at an expected \u00a3150m. IMPG expects quick returns on its money. Its corporate development director Tunch Kashif explains: 'We look to invest in companies that can increase tenfold in the space of a year. This company made revenues of \u00a325,000 in their first three weeks. This is the sort of company we are interested in.' IMPG expects to reap a return of at least \u00a310m on its initial investment within the first year. Although all four men are in their early twenties, none are new to business. Haycock and Atalla both sold computer hardware before going to college. In his teens Boardman ran a mobile disco. At 14 Edmondson started a gardening service, cutting lawns, planting bulbs and trimming borders in his hometown, Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Studentnet.com is planning to cover around 60 major British student towns and cities before the end of the year. The company will then look to expand into Europe and the US. Without the IMPG money this would not be possible but the four directors may one day regret having had to sell so much of their company to get backing. This kind of growth means long hours and they usually work a seven-day week. This sort of schedule must be particularly gruelling for Atalla and Boardman who also live together. 'Some people wonder whether we are happy working this hard,' says Edmondson. 'But there is plenty of time to do other things later. The bottom line is if we weren't happy we wouldn't be doing this.' Now that is something you would never have heard in the Young Ones.",

      "body": "<b>Accounting for the entrepreneurs</b> <p> 'There has been a lot of hard work along the way. There have been some late nights, and lots of tears and sweat. But when I look back on it I do think that it has been surprisingly easy. I could do it all again.' </p> <p>The voice of an entrepreneur who didn't make it on to this list because his claimed \u00a320m valuation was unverifiable. Most of the companies owned by the entrepreneurs - the list is dominated by the internet - have never made a profit. And yet the combined value of the 40 business people on this list is \u00a3610m. </p> <p>In the past 12 months the scale of wealth has increased massively as the e-commerce boom has distorted the value of the stock market. For most of the business people on this list, their main financial value comes from the stake they hold in their own firm. Where a company has been floated we have calculated the market value of an individual's stake in that business. Where the businesses are not floated, we have interviewed the investors and market analysts. And where valuations have not been possible - for instance when a company is registered in Jersey or the investors are publicity shy - the individual has not been included. These are the most accurate figures available at the end of February but in most cases they are stock market valuations, which means they can go down as well as up.</p> <p><b>1 Jason Drummond, 30</b><br> Founder, Virtual Internet <br> \u00a3123 million</p> <p> Jason Drummond gives the impression of being in a hurry. When he listens his foot taps impatiently, and he constantly fiddles with his keys or a couple of pens on his desk in his cramped and featureless office in a large Georgian building in Fulham - around the corner from where he grew up. His eyes are cobalt blue, and he carries a little too much weight for his 5ft 8in frame. Although he doesn't play any sport, he looks like a rugby player in need of a few weeks' pre-season training. </p> <p>But aged 30 he is worth more than the Spice Girls put together and is about to get a whole lot richer when his Virtual Internet company floats on the full Stock Market later this month. He claims that when he was a child he told his mother that he wanted to be a shopkeeper. Indeed his mum, who was divorced from his father when Drummond was just four, crops up regularly in his conversation. </p> <p>His mother, he says, is where he gets his drive. She didn't remarry, and struggled to bring up Drummond and his brothers: Justin, who was then 12 months, and six-year-old Nigel. 'It was a middle-class upbringing without the money,' remembers Drummond. 'My mother gave us our values. Not to be too English, not to accept that there were any positions that we couldn't achieve or aspire to. She gave us the confidence that with hard work anything is possible.' Drummond's father remains estranged from the family. </p> <p> While still at his Fulham comprehensive, Drummond began selling mail-order computers. He left school after his A-levels and worked as a salesman for Reed Business Publishing where he first saw a fax machine - it didn't exactly change his life but it did make an immediate impact. 'It took me five minutes to decide to leave the company and set up my own fax business.' </p> <p>He went on to set up and sell a number of computer and technology firms before founding Virtual Internet in 1996. It has carved a lucrative business out of registering domain names for companies on the internet to protect their copyright and brand names. In essence it provides security to any business operating on the internet. </p> <p>The company, which for the moment is floated on the Alternative Investment Market, has a market capitalisation of \u00a3179m. It is more highly valued by the City than household retail names like House of Fraser, Storehouse, French Connection and Harvey Nichols. Drummond owns 69 per cent. </p> <p> 'It's not about the cash, otherwise I would have retired,' Drummond says, as he drops the pen he has been fiddling with. 'It's about making this company a dominant force in Europe, and being big enough to challenge the largest American companies.' He says he wants to be a 'leader' in the new business order but gives little clue as to where that ambition comes from. These are grand plans from a company which only turned in profits of \u00a32.1m last year, even if this is \u00a32.1m more than most internet companies make. </p> <p>At home, Drummond is determined to be the father he never had. He met his wife Jackie, who was then an airline stewardess, when he was 20. They have been married for eight years, and have two children: three-year-old Mathew and Phoebe, who is 15 months. There is nothing on his messy desk to remind him of his family. </p> <p>But uniquely among these entrepreneurs, he never works at weekends. They are reserved for his family. 'Jackie stopped working a couple of years ago, and she's in charge of what we do at home. I'm happy to go along with that.' </p> <p>Ironically it is the family which is now forcing its way into Drummond's business activities. Last November Drummond quietly set up a new 'family' business - a web TV venture called onthebox.com. He is the sole director and his wife is company secretary. Its purpose is unclear but if it is as successful as his day job the family will never have to worry about a pension. It may even stop Drummond being in such a hurry.</p> <p><b>2 Robert Bonnier, 30</b><br> Chief executive, Scoot.com<br> \u00a372 million </p> <p> The freephone service Scoot.com offers a clear example of the bizarre logic and mathematics involved in technology-related companies. Bonnier's personal fortune - based on his nine per cent stake in Scoot - has shot up from \u00a311m last year to a paper worth of \u00a372m today. At the same time the company made losses of \u00a316m to the end of last September, adding to its losses of \u00a326m the year before. </p> <p>So the value of a loss-making company has increased over 700 per cent - it is valued today at \u00a3780m on the Alternative Investment Market - in the past 12 months. Obviously the value is based on potential future earnings but even so it is an astonishing statistic. </p> <p>It has been a year in which Bonnier had to hire a private detective to track down what was thought to be a disgruntled former employee circulating damaging information about him and his interactive 'yellow pages' company. </p> <p>The document printed the results of an anonymous 'survey' claiming to show that 70 per cent of those who had used Scoot were unhappy with the service. It also dredged up an incident from Bonnier's past when he worked as a financier for the Swiss Bank Corporation. He was investigated, and cleared of any involvement, in an insider-dealing scam in the mid-Nineties. The 'disgruntled one' has not been found; Bonnier says the investigation is 'ongoing'. He was further embarrassed when a former business associate, Ronal Zimet, came under a Serious Fraud Office investigation over his business dealings. Bonnier was not under investigation but fielded awkward questions from the press about his relationship with Zimet, then a Scoot shareholder. But backers believe Bonnier has the Midas touch. In January French multinational Vivendi bought a 10 per cent stake in Scoot for \u00a3100m. Vivendi said: 'We wouldn't be making such a commitment if we hadn't looked very closely at the Scoot business model.' And in August, Vodafone beat a path to its door for exclusive use of its information service on its phones. </p> <p> <b>3 Jonathan Rowland, 24</b> <br> Founder, Jellyworks <br> \u00a340 million<br> </p> <p>There was a debate about including Jonathan Rowland - the son of property developer David Rowland - on this list. He is undoubtedly wealthy but pinning down an absolute value is like trying to pin jelly to a wall. Although his company Jellyworks is valued at \u00a3150m on the Alternative Investment Market, the size of his stake is in doubt. It is held in a family trust. </p> <p>Much of the money used to set up Jellyworks and provide it with a cash pool to make acquisitions came from Rowland family trusts. It is believed the Rowland family now owns around 70 per cent of the company which was chaired by Edward Guinan, a former Wall Street trader and close friend of Rowland senior who quit last month. Our inquiries have concluded that there are at least three other interested parties - family members - with a stake in the trust and that Rowland's stake is valued at \u00a340m. At the time of the float, Jellyworks was worth \u00a310m; afterwards it went as high as \u00a3200m. The reason for this soar in value? Jellyworks is an internet investment vehicle, which has, among other things, taken stakes in EPO.com, a Swedish internet bank and Antfactory, an incubator company which nurtures fledgling online businesses. </p> <p>But the thing to remember is that Rowland's fortune - like that of many on this list is a paper one - built on share ownership. Because only 10 per cent of Jellyworks' shares are available to investors, the laws of supply and demand have sent the company's share price soaring. But if Rowland were to start offloading his stake, it could soon end up having a very different value Rowland left Bedales after his GCSEs, tried his hand at a 'couple of jobs' and ended up working for the family's property business in Norwich.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago he started working directly for his father, learning how business works. Soon it was Rowland junior who was identifying the investment opportunities of the future. 'I understood the internet. I started to source deals, ring people up, meet people,' Rowland says proudly. However, he still has a long way to go in convincing the City of his longevity.</p> <p><b>4 Martha Lane Fox, 27</b><br> Co-founder, lastminute.com<br> \u00a332 million </p> <p>The lift that carries you toward the offices of lastminute.com is full of grubby youths in hooded tops, and the penetrating smell of burgers. 'Oh, McDonald's! Yum!' says Martha Lane Fox, whose two-year-old internet company is due to lay the golden egg when floated on the stock market later this month. It is valued at \u00a3400m, and Lane Fox's shares will be worth \u00a332m. Not that she will discuss this: far too embarrassing. 'I am embarrassed. I've never thought of myself as somebody who would make a lot of money. It wasn't a goal of mine. It's not bad to make loads of money, I don't care if people earn money or not, but in my naive, bourgeois ideology, everyone would share everybody's money and we'd all have the same amount.' </p> <p>There's nowhere to sit in the crowded open-plan office, where none of the trainer-wearing burger-eaters is playing the table football since they're all far too busy toiling away on the website (listing last-minute deals on flights, holidays and entertainments). We adjourn to a grubby corner of the unheated corridor by the lift shaft with a view over central London. Martha is wearing webutante mufti: purple satin-trimmed cardigan and khaki oxford bags and trainers that look like beans. (Her light touch is evident everywhere except with the mascara wand: her eyelashes, already long, resemble Rorschach inkblots.) When she and lastminute.com's co-founder Brent Hoberman, 31, first took their brainchild to prospective investors, they strove to look respectable, but now, 'I think this is what they expect. Initially we went to meet these backers wearing suits and looking completely silly, and gradually we realised they didn't want to see us pretending to be them.' </p> <p>Lane Fox speaks incredibly softly and incredibly fast. People have bitched to the press about how, in her previous incarnation (Westminster school and Oxford university), she was 'mousy' and, worst of all, 'normal', but I can't imagine how she ever passed unnoticed. </p> <p>The daughter of a gardener/classicist and a businesswoman, and the great-niece of the 6th Marquess of Anglesey, she plainly has a terrific entitlement complex, having walked into a series of well-paid consultancy jobs after graduating. 'Yes, of course I had a huge head start because I had an amazing education, which meant I could get a very good job, which taught me how to write business plans, which gave me a web of contacts, and of course it's much harder if you come from a comprehensive school in Glasgow, even if you have a neat e-commerce idea\u0085 but I don't think that means it's insurmountable.' </p> <p>I ask her if the last two years seem quite real. She says she is too busy working to indulge in such thoughts. 'I very rarely stop to reflect on what's happened, to be honest.' Then she relents: 'I'm sure on some deep psychological level I'm in a deep state of shock about it.' The money - she doesn't want to talk about it, but after all, that's why we're here - has yet to make an impact on her life, she says, but that will change after the flotation, when she intends to pay herself the salary 'of someone running a proper public company'. Her flat in Notting Hill was bought before lastminute.com was launched, and she still hasn't replaced the car which she wrote off two years ago. She is 'an obsessive clothes shopper', but then again her favourite store is Top Shop. </p> <p> Rumours about her flying 30 of her best friends out to a villa in the South of France for Millennium Eve are nonsense - 'Yeah, right!' - since they all paid their own fares and stayed in a cottage (I say it must have been some cottage, but she insists it was 'very higgledy-piggledy'). Her last birthday party was not, as reported, top-secret and swanky, but held in a pub in west London. </p> <p>She first worked with Hoberman at Spectrum, advising big companies on new technology. I wonder why he, having had the idea, wanted her on board, but she says it didn't happen like that: 'I think I just forced myself on him.' Hoberman is the visionary, she the facilitator. 'I think I'm a good salesperson,' she says finally. 'I think I can sell the concept to anybody. And certainly there's the advantage of being young, blond and female; I'm realistic about that. But I'm also quite good at doing deals in very difficult circumstances: that's nothing to do with my age or my sex. I am not afraid to be myself.'</p> <p><b>5 Tahir Mohsan, 28</b><br> Computer retailer<br> \u00a335 million </p> <p> When Time Computers won a recent business award in the northwest as the 'best emerging company' there was a rumour in Manchester that Tahir Mohsan would attend the ceremony to pick up the prize. But, true to form, Time Computer's managing director was nowhere to be seen. Nobody has ever published a photograph of Mohsan and it is claimed that local newspapers in Blackburn and Burnley have an unspoken agreement not to print his picture - Time is both a major employer and advertiser in the area. The most vivid description is from a former Time employee who paints him as a 'slight, thin, shortish bloke'. </p> <p>His parents came to Blackburn from Pakistan and the only story to emerge about him is that the company was originally set up by his brother Dr Tariq Mohammed to keep young Tahir 'out of trouble'. In 12 years that is it about this man who works 18 hours per day, six or seven days per week. He topped last year's Young Rich list, but has been outpaced by the virtual millions of others. However, his millions are real - he has a 30 per cent stake in Time and it made \u00a34.5m profit on a turnover of \u00a3105.4m in 1998. And in the past 12 months he has been busy collecting another 11 directorships - most in what appear to be new 'family' ventures including Supanet which suggests that Mohsan and Dr Mohammed - probably with the help of their other three brothers - might be getting involved in net ventures. </p> <p><b> 6 Rob Lewis, 30 </b><br> Founder, Silicon.com <br> \u00a328 million </p> <p>If, like me, you thought that the only person who bumped into Swiss nuclear physicists at London parties was James Bond, think again. The start of Rob Lewis's fascination with the internet can be traced to such a chance meeting in 1996. The scientists from Cern in Switzerland convinced him of the power of the net and he was hooked. </p> <p> The following day Lewis - who up until that point had been involved in traditional magazine publishing - concluded that print was dead. At least when it came to communicating with the IT industry and he set about launching Silicom.com - a web TV company reaching just under 300,000 high-spending IT professionals. There are plans to extend the service into Germany, France and Scandinavia later this year. </p> <p> 'Four years ago it was virtually impossible to get venture capitalists to invest in the web, because they thought it was so untried,' says Lewis with a smile on his face. 'It was all private money. But now they are so scared of being left out of the revolution they are falling over themselves to lend money.' </p> <p>Last November a consortium of venture capital firms headed by Amadeus Capital Partners invested \u00a311m in Silicon.com. The company has been extravagantly valued at \u00a3800m in some quarters, but through conversations with a number of those who have invested - and market analysts - we believe \u00a3100m is a more accurate figure. Lewis holds 15 per cent. He also owns a third of the software company Cromwell Media which has been valued at \u00a340m.</p> <p> The path to millionaire status started at 17 for the hyperactive Lewis, when he took a year off before sitting his A-levels to answer the phones at a small publishing firm. Within 12 months he was editing one of its technology titles. At Cambridge, where he studied economics, he set up a rival to Varsity - the college student newspaper - called The Cambridge Weekly Review. This attracted the attention of Independent Newspapers owner Tony O'Reilly and it briefly became a national student newspaper called The Weekly Review in the early Nineties. </p> <p> After college Lewis spent two years as the researcher for Huddersfield Labour MP Barry Sheerman in the run-up to the 1992 election, a low point in his life. 'We really thought we could win. I spent election night at a \"victory\" party in Huddersfield. That was the most depressing thing I have ever done.' Lewis left politics and in 1993 started a computer title, Business and Technology Magazine, in a friend's flat in Notting Hill. It was bought by Dennis Publishing for a claimed \u00a31m in 1996. </p> <p>That is when he bumped into those nuclear physicists. A meeting that changed his life. </p> <p><b>7 Charlie Muirhead, 24</b> <br> Founder, Orchestream <br> \u00a321 million</p> <p> Orchestream manages and secures internet network systems - in layman's terms it is the maintenance company which sorts out problems. He owns a majority share in the company which has already attracted more than \u00a340m of backing from venture capitalists such as Atlas Ventures and Deutsche Bank and other interested businesses, notably the chip maker Intel. However if, as expected, the company floats, Muirhead's value will soar - possibly as high as \u00a3200m. Muirhead is coy about any flotation: 'We're going through a huge growth spurt at the moment. A float is not the first thing on our minds. It is something we're considering.' Muirhead's earliest backer was record producer Hugh Padgham - he lent Muirhead \u00a320,000 to set up an internet service provider. The two met when Muirhead, who was educated at Bedales (where he became mates with Jonathan Rowland; see number three) and Westminster schools, was taking a year out before going to university. His enthusiasm for technology was sparked while working as a glorified roadie for a company which supplied musical equipment and instruments to bands. While working for the company, Muirhead helped initiate a \u00a3350,000 management buyout, giving him his first taste of the entrepreneurial life. The ISP scheme folded but, having studied computer science at Imperial College, London, Muirhead, a skiing and diving nut, was able 'to understand how a microprocessor worked'. Orchestream was formed out of his frustration that the internet was too slow. </p> <p> The company is now three years old and employs 75 people, all of whom have share options. Securing funding in the first place, however, was not the easiest thing but backers' curiosity got the better of them. 'People would giggle and then listen to what we had to say.' </p> <p> The firm's soaring success - clients include Toys R Us and the US defence department - belies its once-humble origins. Orchestream's original London HQ was based above a funeral parlour. Muirhead recalls: 'We would all go down into the basement below to smoke and potential investors would have to walk through. What on earth they must have been thinking, I don't know.'</p> <p><b>8 Mark Slater, 30 </b><br> Internet financier<br> \u00a319.5 million </p> <p>It took Mark Slater 10 years to make his first \u00a32.5m and 10 months to make the next \u00a317m, transforming him from being very wealthy to enormously wealthy in the past four months.</p> <p> Like several people on this list, he has had a massive helping hand via his family's wealth. Aged 16, Slater was given money to invest by his father, the legendary financier Jim Slater - a contemporary of James Goldsmith and Tiny Rowland - whose own finance company spectacularly failed in the Seventies. </p> <p> A similar fate is unlikely to befall his son. Slater junior has used the money he has made in the past decade from his finance company, Slater Investments, to launch Internet Indirect which invests in small start-up companies designing software to make the net work better. When it floated on the Alternative Investment Market last December it was valued at \u00a3100m. Slater junior holds a 17 per cent stake and his father 10 per cent.</p> <p> 'I am sceptical about selling goods over the internet to consumers,' he says. 'I prefer the business-to-business route. Businesses expect to pay for services. But on the internet, consumers expect to get things for free or very cheap.' </p> <p>Even though his father's business failed, there has always been plenty of money to provide for his four children - two sons and two daughters. Mark Slater went to Arundel public school and then read history at Cambridge. Between college and starting his investment company in 1994 he mixed careers, working as a bond dealer and a business reporter for the Investors Chronicle, among other titles. </p> <p><b>9 Dylan Wilk, 25 </b><br> Computer games supplier <br> \u00a318.6 million</p> <p> This was the deal year for Wilk. It is the dilemma every successful company owner faces - whether to stay independent or sell to a bigger business in order to compete on a larger stage. That Wilk had to make this decision at 25 shows the pace of his progress.</p> <p> Last July he sold his mail-order computer games business, Interactive Commercial Enterprises, to AIM-listed internet games business Gameplay.com. The deal gave Wilk \u00a32.6m in cash, a seat on the Gameplay board, and 5 per cent of the enlarged company. Gameplay.com is currently capitalised at \u00a3328m, which values Wilk's shares at \u00a316m. </p> <p>Wilk's rags-to-riches tale is such a classic one that it should come with violin accompaniment. He was raised by his mother on a council estate in Leeds and won a scholarship to Bradford grammar school. There he saw the wealth of his classmates and decided to make some money for himself. </p> <p> He left school at 16 and worked for a mail-order fish food firm, but it was always in his mind to work for himself. A year later he decided on a mail-order computer software business because customers couldn't tell how young he was, and thousands of games packages were small enough to fit into his bedroom. </p> <p> He borrowed \u00a32,500 from the Prince's Trust in 1994 and he was off. By the time he sold the company last year, it was one of the largest mail-order computer games outfits in the UK, with 275,000 regular customers. When not working hard, he likes to travel fast. In fact he was banned from driving for speeding, and had to sell his convertible Ferrari 355 and his BMW M3. However, the ban ended last summer and he was last seen in a private session at Brands Hatch.</p> <p><b>10 Ernesto Schmitt, 28 </b><br> Founder, peoplesound.com <br> \u00a317 million</p> <p>If Ernesto Schmitt stepped in a cow pat, it would smell of roses. Tall, good-looking, cosmopolitan, bright and rich too. We love him. Schmitt is one of the first new-age music publishers. Last December, his company peoplesound.com was valued by US investment bank, Merrill Lynch, at \u00a347m. Schmitt has a stake of 35 per cent which equates to \u00a317m. His founding partner, Paul Levett, holds a five per cent stake which means that at the age of 29, he is also sitting on a \u00a32.35m fortune. </p> <p>Peoplesound.com - spot the social democratic, egalitarian credentials - showcases new bands on the web and allows the record-buying public to buy CDs. Visitors to the site download two million tracks per month. Backed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury goods company LVMH, peoplesound.com will float some time this year at an expected market value of \u00a380m. But it is the prospect of peoplesound being bought out which will really propel the art-loving Schmitt into the financial stratosphere. Peoplesound.com is an obvious content fit for a 'technology distributor' such as Yahoo! or an established music label. </p> <p>Schmitt's life so far is a catalogue of high-achievement. Son of a globe-trotting Proctor &amp; Gamble engineer father and Uruguayan mother, he was born in the US and his early days were spent mainly in Belgium and Mexico. He studied at Cambridge, went to the Insead business school in France before doing a stint at Boston Consulting, one of the world's premier management consultancies. </p> <p>But when it comes to the business he is more reticent. He refuses to give any turnover figures but concedes that the site does not make money. In the crazy economics of the internet that does not matter. What does is first entry into virgin territory and cashing your chips before the bubble bursts. So the next year is make or break for Schmitt.</p>",

But when I look back on it I do think that it has been surprisingly easy. I could do it all again.' The voice of an entrepreneur who didn't make it on to this list because his claimed \u00a320m valuation was unverifiable. Most of the companies owned by the entrepreneurs - the list is dominated by the internet - have never made a profit. And yet the combined value of the 40 business people on this list is \u00a3610m. In the past 12 months the scale of wealth has increased massively as the e-commerce boom has distorted the value of the stock market. For most of the business people on this list, their main financial value comes from the stake they hold in their own firm. Where a company has been floated we have calculated the market value of an individual's stake in that business. Where the businesses are not floated, we have interviewed the investors and market analysts. And where valuations have not been possible - for instance when a company is registered in Jersey or the investors are publicity shy - the individual has not been included. These are the most accurate figures available at the end of February but in most cases they are stock market valuations, which means they can go down as well as up. 1 Jason Drummond, 30 Founder, Virtual Internet \u00a3123 million Jason Drummond gives the impression of being in a hurry. When he listens his foot taps impatiently, and he constantly fiddles with his keys or a couple of pens on his desk in his cramped and featureless office in a large Georgian building in Fulham - around the corner from where he grew up. His eyes are cobalt blue, and he carries a little too much weight for his 5ft 8in frame. Although he doesn't play any sport, he looks like a rugby player in need of a few weeks' pre-season training. But aged 30 he is worth more than the Spice Girls put together and is about to get a whole lot richer when his Virtual Internet company floats on the full Stock Market later this month. He claims that when he was a child he told his mother that he wanted to be a shopkeeper. Indeed his mum, who was divorced from his father when Drummond was just four, crops up regularly in his conversation. His mother, he says, is where he gets his drive. She didn't remarry, and struggled to bring up Drummond and his brothers: Justin, who was then 12 months, and six-year-old Nigel. 'It was a middle-class upbringing without the money,' remembers Drummond. 'My mother gave us our values. Not to be too English, not to accept that there were any positions that we couldn't achieve or aspire to. She gave us the confidence that with hard work anything is possible.' Drummond's father remains estranged from the family. While still at his Fulham comprehensive, Drummond began selling mail-order computers. He left school after his A-levels and worked as a salesman for Reed Business Publishing where he first saw a fax machine - it didn't exactly change his life but it did make an immediate impact. 'It took me five minutes to decide to leave the company and set up my own fax business.' He went on to set up and sell a number of computer and technology firms before founding Virtual Internet in 1996. It has carved a lucrative business out of registering domain names for companies on the internet to protect their copyright and brand names. In essence it provides security to any business operating on the internet. The company, which for the moment is floated on the Alternative Investment Market, has a market capitalisation of \u00a3179m. It is more highly valued by the City than household retail names like House of Fraser, Storehouse, French Connection and Harvey Nichols. Drummond owns 69 per cent. 'It's not about the cash, otherwise I would have retired,' Drummond says, as he drops the pen he has been fiddling with. 'It's about making this company a dominant force in Europe, and being big enough to challenge the largest American companies.' He says he wants to be a 'leader' in the new business order but gives little clue as to where that ambition comes from. These are grand plans from a company which only turned in profits of \u00a32.1m last year, even if this is \u00a32.1m more than most internet companies make. At home, Drummond is determined to be the father he never had. He met his wife Jackie, who was then an airline stewardess, when he was 20. They have been married for eight years, and have two children: three-year-old Mathew and Phoebe, who is 15 months. There is nothing on his messy desk to remind him of his family. But uniquely among these entrepreneurs, he never works at weekends. They are reserved for his family. 'Jackie stopped working a couple of years ago, and she's in charge of what we do at home. I'm happy to go along with that.' Ironically it is the family which is now forcing its way into Drummond's business activities. Last November Drummond quietly set up a new 'family' business - a web TV venture called onthebox.com. He is the sole director and his wife is company secretary. Its purpose is unclear but if it is as successful as his day job the family will never have to worry about a pension. It may even stop Drummond being in such a hurry. 2 Robert Bonnier, 30 Chief executive, Scoot.com \u00a372 million The freephone service Scoot.com offers a clear example of the bizarre logic and mathematics involved in technology-related companies. Bonnier's personal fortune - based on his nine per cent stake in Scoot - has shot up from \u00a311m last year to a paper worth of \u00a372m today. At the same time the company made losses of \u00a316m to the end of last September, adding to its losses of \u00a326m the year before. So the value of a loss-making company has increased over 700 per cent - it is valued today at \u00a3780m on the Alternative Investment Market - in the past 12 months. Obviously the value is based on potential future earnings but even so it is an astonishing statistic. It has been a year in which Bonnier had to hire a private detective to track down what was thought to be a disgruntled former employee circulating damaging information about him and his interactive 'yellow pages' company. The document printed the results of an anonymous 'survey' claiming to show that 70 per cent of those who had used Scoot were unhappy with the service. It also dredged up an incident from Bonnier's past when he worked as a financier for the Swiss Bank Corporation. He was investigated, and cleared of any involvement, in an insider-dealing scam in the mid-Nineties. The 'disgruntled one' has not been found; Bonnier says the investigation is 'ongoing'. He was further embarrassed when a former business associate, Ronal Zimet, came under a Serious Fraud Office investigation over his business dealings. Bonnier was not under investigation but fielded awkward questions from the press about his relationship with Zimet, then a Scoot shareholder. But backers believe Bonnier has the Midas touch. In January French multinational Vivendi bought a 10 per cent stake in Scoot for \u00a3100m. Vivendi said: 'We wouldn't be making such a commitment if we hadn't looked very closely at the Scoot business model.' And in August, Vodafone beat a path to its door for exclusive use of its information service on its phones. 3 Jonathan Rowland, 24 Founder, Jellyworks \u00a340 million There was a debate about including Jonathan Rowland - the son of property developer David Rowland - on this list. He is undoubtedly wealthy but pinning down an absolute value is like trying to pin jelly to a wall. Although his company Jellyworks is valued at \u00a3150m on the Alternative Investment Market, the size of his stake is in doubt. It is held in a family trust. Much of the money used to set up Jellyworks and provide it with a cash pool to make acquisitions came from Rowland family trusts. It is believed the Rowland family now owns around 70 per cent of the company which was chaired by Edward Guinan, a former Wall Street trader and close friend of Rowland senior who quit last month. Our inquiries have concluded that there are at least three other interested parties - family members - with a stake in the trust and that Rowland's stake is valued at \u00a340m. At the time of the float, Jellyworks was worth \u00a310m; afterwards it went as high as \u00a3200m. The reason for this soar in value? Jellyworks is an internet investment vehicle, which has, among other things, taken stakes in EPO.com, a Swedish internet bank and Antfactory, an incubator company which nurtures fledgling online businesses. But the thing to remember is that Rowland's fortune - like that of many on this list is a paper one - built on share ownership. Because only 10 per cent of Jellyworks' shares are available to investors, the laws of supply and demand have sent the company's share price soaring. But if Rowland were to start offloading his stake, it could soon end up having a very different value Rowland left Bedales after his GCSEs, tried his hand at a 'couple of jobs' and ended up working for the family's property business in Norwich. Eighteen months ago he started working directly for his father, learning how business works. Soon it was Rowland junior who was identifying the investment opportunities of the future. 'I understood the internet. I started to source deals, ring people up, meet people,' Rowland says proudly. However, he still has a long way to go in convincing the City of his longevity. 4 Martha Lane Fox, 27 Co-founder, lastminute.com \u00a332 million The lift that carries you toward the offices of lastminute.com is full of grubby youths in hooded tops, and the penetrating smell of burgers. 'Oh, McDonald's! Yum!' says Martha Lane Fox, whose two-year-old internet company is due to lay the golden egg when floated on the stock market later this month. It is valued at \u00a3400m, and Lane Fox's shares will be worth \u00a332m. Not that she will discuss this: far too embarrassing. 'I am embarrassed. I've never thought of myself as somebody who would make a lot of money. It wasn't a goal of mine. It's not bad to make loads of money, I don't care if people earn money or not, but in my naive, bourgeois ideology, everyone would share everybody's money and we'd all have the same amount.' There's nowhere to sit in the crowded open-plan office, where none of the trainer-wearing burger-eaters is playing the table football since they're all far too busy toiling away on the website (listing last-minute deals on flights, holidays and entertainments). We adjourn to a grubby corner of the unheated corridor by the lift shaft with a view over central London. Martha is wearing webutante mufti: purple satin-trimmed cardigan and khaki oxford bags and trainers that look like beans. (Her light touch is evident everywhere except with the mascara wand: her eyelashes, already long, resemble Rorschach inkblots.) When she and lastminute.com's co-founder Brent Hoberman, 31, first took their brainchild to prospective investors, they strove to look respectable, but now, 'I think this is what they expect. Initially we went to meet these backers wearing suits and looking completely silly, and gradually we realised they didn't want to see us pretending to be them.' Lane Fox speaks incredibly softly and incredibly fast. People have bitched to the press about how, in her previous incarnation (Westminster school and Oxford university), she was 'mousy' and, worst of all, 'normal', but I can't imagine how she ever passed unnoticed. The daughter of a gardener/classicist and a businesswoman, and the great-niece of the 6th Marquess of Anglesey, she plainly has a terrific entitlement complex, having walked into a series of well-paid consultancy jobs after graduating. 'Yes, of course I had a huge head start because I had an amazing education, which meant I could get a very good job, which taught me how to write business plans, which gave me a web of contacts, and of course it's much harder if you come from a comprehensive school in Glasgow, even if you have a neat e-commerce idea\u0085 but I don't think that means it's insurmountable.' I ask her if the last two years seem quite real. She says she is too busy working to indulge in such thoughts. 'I very rarely stop to reflect on what's happened, to be honest.' Then she relents: 'I'm sure on some deep psychological level I'm in a deep state of shock about it.' The money - she doesn't want to talk about it, but after all, that's why we're here - has yet to make an impact on her life, she says, but that will change after the flotation, when she intends to pay herself the salary 'of someone running a proper public company'. Her flat in Notting Hill was bought before lastminute.com was launched, and she still hasn't replaced the car which she wrote off two years ago. She is 'an obsessive clothes shopper', but then again her favourite store is Top Shop. Rumours about her flying 30 of her best friends out to a villa in the South of France for Millennium Eve are nonsense - 'Yeah, right!' - since they all paid their own fares and stayed in a cottage (I say it must have been some cottage, but she insists it was 'very higgledy-piggledy'). Her last birthday party was not, as reported, top-secret and swanky, but held in a pub in west London. She first worked with Hoberman at Spectrum, advising big companies on new technology. I wonder why he, having had the idea, wanted her on board, but she says it didn't happen like that: 'I think I just forced myself on him.' Hoberman is the visionary, she the facilitator. 'I think I'm a good salesperson,' she says finally. 'I think I can sell the concept to anybody. And certainly there's the advantage of being young, blond and female; I'm realistic about that. But I'm also quite good at doing deals in very difficult circumstances: that's nothing to do with my age or my sex. I am not afraid to be myself.' 5 Tahir Mohsan, 28 Computer retailer \u00a335 million When Time Computers won a recent business award in the northwest as the 'best emerging company' there was a rumour in Manchester that Tahir Mohsan would attend the ceremony to pick up the prize. But, true to form, Time Computer's managing director was nowhere to be seen. Nobody has ever published a photograph of Mohsan and it is claimed that local newspapers in Blackburn and Burnley have an unspoken agreement not to print his picture - Time is both a major employer and advertiser in the area. The most vivid description is from a former Time employee who paints him as a 'slight, thin, shortish bloke'. His parents came to Blackburn from Pakistan and the only story to emerge about him is that the company was originally set up by his brother Dr Tariq Mohammed to keep young Tahir 'out of trouble'. In 12 years that is it about this man who works 18 hours per day, six or seven days per week. He topped last year's Young Rich list, but has been outpaced by the virtual millions of others. However, his millions are real - he has a 30 per cent stake in Time and it made \u00a34.5m profit on a turnover of \u00a3105.4m in 1998. And in the past 12 months he has been busy collecting another 11 directorships - most in what appear to be new 'family' ventures including Supanet which suggests that Mohsan and Dr Mohammed - probably with the help of their other three brothers - might be getting involved in net ventures. 6 Rob Lewis, 30 Founder, Silicon.com \u00a328 million If, like me, you thought that the only person who bumped into Swiss nuclear physicists at London parties was James Bond, think again.

But now they are so scared of being left out of the revolution they are falling over themselves to lend money.' Last November a consortium of venture capital firms headed by Amadeus Capital Partners invested \u00a311m in Silicon.com. The company has been extravagantly valued at \u00a3800m in some quarters, but through conversations with a number of those who have invested - and market analysts - we believe \u00a3100m is a more accurate figure. Lewis holds 15 per cent. He also owns a third of the software company Cromwell Media which has been valued at \u00a340m. The path to millionaire status started at 17 for the hyperactive Lewis, when he took a year off before sitting his A-levels to answer the phones at a small publishing firm.

That is when he bumped into those nuclear physicists. A meeting that changed his life. 7 Charlie Muirhead, 24 Founder, Orchestream \u00a321 million Orchestream manages and secures internet network systems - in layman's terms it is the maintenance company which sorts out problems. He owns a majority share in the company which has already attracted more than \u00a340m of backing from venture capitalists such as Atlas Ventures and Deutsche Bank and other interested businesses, notably the chip maker Intel. However if, as expected, the company floats, Muirhead's value will soar - possibly as high as \u00a3200m. Muirhead is coy about any flotation: 'We're going through a huge growth spurt at the moment. A float is not the first thing on our minds. It is something we're considering.' Muirhead's earliest backer was record producer Hugh Padgham - he lent Muirhead \u00a320,000 to set up an internet service provider. The two met when Muirhead, who was educated at Bedales (where he became mates with Jonathan Rowland; see number three) and Westminster schools, was taking a year out before going to university. His enthusiasm for technology was sparked while working as a glorified roadie for a company which supplied musical equipment and instruments to bands. While working for the company, Muirhead helped initiate a \u00a3350,000 management buyout, giving him his first taste of the entrepreneurial life. The ISP scheme folded but, having studied computer science at Imperial College, London, Muirhead, a skiing and diving nut, was able 'to understand how a microprocessor worked'. Orchestream was formed out of his frustration that the internet was too slow. The company is now three years old and employs 75 people, all of whom have share options. Securing funding in the first place, however, was not the easiest thing but backers' curiosity got the better of them. 'People would giggle and then listen to what we had to say.' The firm's soaring success - clients include Toys R Us and the US defence department - belies its once-humble origins. Orchestream's original London HQ was based above a funeral parlour. Muirhead recalls: 'We would all go down into the basement below to smoke and potential investors would have to walk through. What on earth they must have been thinking, I don't know.' 8 Mark Slater, 30 Internet financier \u00a319.5 million It took Mark Slater 10 years to make his first \u00a32.5m and 10 months to make the next \u00a317m, transforming him from being very wealthy to enormously wealthy in the past four months. Like several people on this list, he has had a massive helping hand via his family's wealth. Aged 16, Slater was given money to invest by his father, the legendary financier Jim Slater - a contemporary of James Goldsmith and Tiny Rowland - whose own finance company spectacularly failed in the Seventies. A similar fate is unlikely to befall his son. Slater junior has used the money he has made in the past decade from his finance company, Slater Investments, to launch Internet Indirect which invests in small start-up companies designing software to make the net work better. When it floated on the Alternative Investment Market last December it was valued at \u00a3100m. Slater junior holds a 17 per cent stake and his father 10 per cent. 'I am sceptical about selling goods over the internet to consumers,' he says. 'I prefer the business-to-business route. Businesses expect to pay for services. But on the internet, consumers expect to get things for free or very cheap.' Even though his father's business failed, there has always been plenty of money to provide for his four children - two sons and two daughters. Mark Slater went to Arundel public school and then read history at Cambridge. Between college and starting his investment company in 1994 he mixed careers, working as a bond dealer and a business reporter for the Investors Chronicle, among other titles. 9 Dylan Wilk, 25 Computer games supplier \u00a318.6 million This was the deal year for Wilk. It is the dilemma every successful company owner faces - whether to stay independent or sell to a bigger business in order to compete on a larger stage. That Wilk had to make this decision at 25 shows the pace of his progress. Last July he sold his mail-order computer games business, Interactive Commercial Enterprises, to AIM-listed internet games business Gameplay.com. The deal gave Wilk \u00a32.6m in cash, a seat on the Gameplay board, and 5 per cent of the enlarged company. Gameplay.com is currently capitalised at \u00a3328m, which values Wilk's shares at \u00a316m. Wilk's rags-to-riches tale is such a classic one that it should come with violin accompaniment. He was raised by his mother on a council estate in Leeds and won a scholarship to Bradford grammar school. There he saw the wealth of his classmates and decided to make some money for himself. He left school at 16 and worked for a mail-order fish food firm, but it was always in his mind to work for himself. A year later he decided on a mail-order computer software business because customers couldn't tell how young he was, and thousands of games packages were small enough to fit into his bedroom. He borrowed \u00a32,500 from the Prince's Trust in 1994 and he was off. By the time he sold the company last year, it was one of the largest mail-order computer games outfits in the UK, with 275,000 regular customers. When not working hard, he likes to travel fast. In fact he was banned from driving for speeding, and had to sell his convertible Ferrari 355 and his BMW M3. However, the ban ended last summer and he was last seen in a private session at Brands Hatch. 10 Ernesto Schmitt, 28 Founder, peoplesound.com \u00a317 million If Ernesto Schmitt stepped in a cow pat, it would smell of roses. Tall, good-looking, cosmopolitan, bright and rich too. We love him. Schmitt is one of the first new-age music publishers. Last December, his company peoplesound.com was valued by US investment bank, Merrill Lynch, at \u00a347m. Schmitt has a stake of 35 per cent which equates to \u00a317m. His founding partner, Paul Levett, holds a five per cent stake which means that at the age of 29, he is also sitting on a \u00a32.35m fortune. Peoplesound.com - spot the social democratic, egalitarian credentials - showcases new bands on the web and allows the record-buying public to buy CDs. Visitors to the site download two million tracks per month. Backed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury goods company LVMH, peoplesound.com will float some time this year at an expected market value of \u00a380m. But it is the prospect of peoplesound being bought out which will really propel the art-loving Schmitt into the financial stratosphere. Peoplesound.com is an obvious content fit for a 'technology distributor' such as Yahoo! or an established music label. Schmitt's life so far is a catalogue of high-achievement. Son of a globe-trotting Proctor &amp; Gamble engineer father and Uruguayan mother, he was born in the US and his early days were spent mainly in Belgium and Mexico. He studied at Cambridge, went to the Insead business school in France before doing a stint at Boston Consulting, one of the world's premier management consultancies. But when it comes to the business he is more reticent. He refuses to give any turnover figures but concedes that the site does not make money. In the crazy economics of the internet that does not matter. What does is first entry into virgin territory and cashing your chips before the bubble bursts. So the next year is make or break for Schmitt.",

      "body": "<p>11. <b>Catherine Zeta Jones</b>, 30</p> <p>Actress. \u00a313 million.</p> <p>Since her starring role alongside Sean Connery in Entrapment, Zeta Jones is slowly beginning to match on screen the high profile which her relationship with Michael Douglas has guaranteed her off screen. She can now command between \u00a35m and \u00a36m per film, and has already signed up to three new projects, The Haunting, Ace in the Hole and a film version of Nick Hornby's book High Fidelity which should net her a minimum \u00a315m. In an attempt to cement her future earning potential, Zeta Jones has also started to create her own dynasty through Zeta Films, a subsidiary of the Los Angeles based Initial Entertainment Group.</p> <p>Her brother, Lyndon, will partner her in the two year, 12-film deal with IEG, with whom Zeta Jones's other brother, David, is a senior executive. There is speculation that the new venture is receiving \u00a3250m of backing to invest in the films but Zeta Jones will see very little of that money. 'Zeta Jones will add her name to the production credits, lending the films greater publicity, and might even offer her acting services to boost its box office,' says one senior Hollywood source.</p> <p>Zeta Films will receive a percentage for each of the films, budgeted at between \u00a33m and \u00a330m. Her UK company Zeta Enterprise Limited was created in 1991 at the start of her career and her parents remain as directors. Since falling pregnant, Zeta Jones has dropped out of the Oliver Stone film, Beyond Borders. Her next project, High Fidelity, is unaffected - the filmmakers have agreed to only shoot her from the waist up. This is a conservative valuation because, although the Welsh actress has hit the big time, she is only now reaping the dividends.</p> <p>12. <b>Robbie Williams</b>, 26</p> <p>All-round entertainer. \u00a311.25 million.</p> <p>In the UK, Williams's first album, Life Thru a Lens has turned seven times platinum - selling 2.1m copies. The subsequent I've Been Expecting You has sold even better - more than 2.4m albums to date. In total, as a solo artist, Williams has sold over seven million records worldwide, suggesting that his home turf still proves to be the most lucrative for the former Take That star. Williams walked away from the group after a rift with songwriter Gary Barlow, having earned \u00a35m.</p> <p>And although he lags behind Barlow in the money stakes, his well-publicised problems with drugs and drink are not hindering his attempts to catch his former friend. This year, earnings from tours, record sales and sponsorships, including Pepsi have topped \u00a35m. He has still to conquer the US but recent tours have paved the way. Still, his decision to buy a \u00a34m house in Notting Hill suggests he is staying on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>13. <b>Naomi Campbell</b>, 29</p> <p>Model. \u00a311 million.</p> <p>Having escaped a possible prison sentence, when a court in Canada downgraded an assault charge brought against Campbell, she can now look forward to a better year. After a 16-year career, Campbell can earn up to \u00a31.5m per year, but she has recently made it clear that she will be making fewer appearances - blaming stress for her decision to pull out of London and New York shows. However, she did a u-turn over her decision not to take part in London Fashion Week.</p> <p>14. <b>Kate Moss</b>, 26</p> <p>Model. \u00a311 million.</p> <p>For the last three years the waif with the estuary vowels has made an estimated \u00a32.4m a year, and \u00a31m for the three years prior to that. Her exclusive contract with Calvin Klein expired in January 1999, leaving her free to work elsewhere, but still receiving payment for its use of her image. A recent L'Oreal deal will rake in \u00a33m over its lifetime, and Yves Saint Laurent and Bradbury advertising deals are likely to earn her \u00a32m a time - her earnings soaring now she is free of the CK exclusivity clause. Moss can command \u00a3300,000 each time she takes to the catwalk, but now often does shows in the UK for free if she likes the designer.</p> <p>15. <b>Liam Gallagher</b>, 27</p> <p>Singer, Oasis. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>Gallagher is fast being aged by his lifestyle, child and wife, but remains the youngest member of an \u00a318m band. From the outset, Oasis split the money equally, but since only Noel and Liam remain of the original line-up, it is likely that the new recruits have a lesser share. The band has just released its new album on the Big Brother label - the successor to Creation Records. It will doubtless prove even more lucrative than its predecessor Be Here Now which, despite lacklustre critical reaction, sold 6m copies in the UK alone, and considerably more worldwide.</p> <p>As money from previous tours and the new record deal will now be in the Gallagher coffers, Liam's wealth is estimated at \u00a38m. A sell-out world tour, plus a chunk of the \u00a32.5m offered to perform at the Reading and Leeds festivals this summer, will further enhance the younger Gallagher's bank balance over the coming 12 months.</p> <p>16. <b>Ewan McGregor</b>, 28</p> <p>Actor. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>Although McGregor was paid just \u00a31m for playing Obi Wan Kenobi in the third biggest-grossing film of all time, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, the prominence it earned him has begun to pay dividends. The Phantom Menace is expected to generate \u00a32.5bn in merchandising. As his face will be on many of these products, it is likely that he was paid a fee at the outset. McGregor was contracted into the next two Star Wars films before he filmed The Phantom Menace, and can expect to earn little more than th \u00a31m he received for the first prequel.</p> <p>Before he met Lucas, McGregor was making smaller amounts on low-budget films such as Little Voice, South from Hell's Kitchen and the Nick Leeson biopic, Rogue Trader. But he has entered the big league and is set to play the lead alongside Nicole Kidman in Baz Luhrmann's Le Moulin Rouge. His post-Star Wars celebrity will prove rewarding, netting a reported \u00a34m. He also holds a five per cent stake in the production company Natural Nylon Entertainment.</p> <p>17. <b>David Coulthard</b>, 28</p> <p>Formula One driver. \u00a38 million.</p> <p>As Coulthard lines up on the grid for today's Melbourne grand prix he will know that this is his make-or-break season. His wealth is enormous but as a driver he has never quite lived up to expectations. Although he finished third last year - bringing him \u00a33m - observers are looking to him to challenge for top slot this season. If he doesn't, he could lose his seat in the McLaren car next year. As with other formula one drivers, Coulthard is barred from carrying non-McLaren sponsors, but sources say that the Scotsman still commands \u00a31.5m per season from non-racing activities.</p> <p>18. <b>Robbie Fowler</b>, 24</p> <p>Footballer, Liverpool &amp; England. \u00a37 million.</p> <p>Even if he was only paid by the game, Robbie Fowler would still be a wealthy man. His seven games since the start of the season would have raked in at least \u00a3378,000 before tax. Fortunately for the injury-ravaged striker, he gets \u00a354,000 a week regardless. As the highest-paid footballer in the country, it was not surprising that a rumoured transfer to Arsenal came to nothing. His long-standing ankle problem was also a factor. He also picks up \u00a3500,000 per year from his boot deal with Nike. Dogged for several years by drugs rumours, which he has always denied, Fowler has recently become a father and started to settle down.</p> <p>19. <b>Shaznay Lewis</b>, 24</p> <p>Singer/songwriter, All Saints. \u00a37 million.</p> <p>All Saints have amassed 1.8m album sales in the UK, and a total of eight million worldwide. Lewis, as the band's songwriter, has seen the majority of the royalties from these sales. The new single, 'Pure Shores', appears on the soundtrack to The Beach. And although they did not receive an advance for the single, the film's high profile will pay dividends for the new album's summer release. It is likely that the other All Saints will have seen little more than \u00a32m each from the band's success and that will not be boosted too much by the acting debut of the Appleton sisters - Nicole and Natalie - in the film Honest.</p> <p>20. <b>Kate Winslet</b>, 25</p> <p>Actress. \u00a36 million.</p> <p>Despite breaking into the Hollywood mainstream of late, Winslet has seen her fair share of bad deals. Titanic, her last appearance as an unknown, netted her a \u00a3200,000 fee plus a rumoured \u00a3600,000 bonus. Hideous Kinky was propped up by Winslet's own cash and proved something of a commercial failure, but that has not prevented her being able to command \u00a33m a film. Winslet plays the title role in the forthcoming remake of Emile Zola's novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin and symbolic of her desire to get more involved behind the scenes, she also works as an executive producer.</p> <p>The executive role will provide her with a fee, and she will benefit from the kudos of being seen to be active behind the scenes. She is also starring alongside Harvey Keitel as Ruth in Jane Campion's Holy Smoke, and Quills, a film about erotic literature - two films which will increase her bankability.</p>",

After a 16-year career, Campbell can earn up to \u00a31.5m per year, but she has recently made it clear that she will be making fewer appearances - blaming stress for her decision to pull out of London and New York shows. However, she did a u-turn over her decision not to take part in London Fashion Week. 14. Kate Moss, 26 Model. \u00a311 million. For the last three years the waif with the estuary vowels has made an estimated \u00a32.4m a year, and \u00a31m for the three years prior to that. Her exclusive contract with Calvin Klein expired in January 1999, leaving her free to work elsewhere, but still receiving payment for its use of her image. A recent L'Oreal deal will rake in \u00a33m over its lifetime, and Yves Saint Laurent and Bradbury advertising deals are likely to earn her \u00a32m a time - her earnings soaring now she is free of the CK exclusivity clause. Moss can command \u00a3300,000 each time she takes to the catwalk, but now often does shows in the UK for free if she likes the designer. 15. Liam Gallagher, 27 Singer, Oasis. \u00a38 million. Gallagher is fast being aged by his lifestyle, child and wife, but remains the youngest member of an \u00a318m band. From the outset, Oasis split the money equally, but since only Noel and Liam remain of the original line-up, it is likely that the new recruits have a lesser share. The band has just released its new album on the Big Brother label - the successor to Creation Records. It will doubtless prove even more lucrative than its predecessor Be Here Now which, despite lacklustre critical reaction, sold 6m copies in the UK alone, and considerably more worldwide. As money from previous tours and the new record deal will now be in the Gallagher coffers, Liam's wealth is estimated at \u00a38m. A sell-out world tour, plus a chunk of the \u00a32.5m offered to perform at the Reading and Leeds festivals this summer, will further enhance the younger Gallagher's bank balance over the coming 12 months. 16. Ewan McGregor, 28 Actor. \u00a38 million. Although McGregor was paid just \u00a31m for playing Obi Wan Kenobi in the third biggest-grossing film of all time, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, the prominence it earned him has begun to pay dividends. The Phantom Menace is expected to generate \u00a32.5bn in merchandising. As his face will be on many of these products, it is likely that he was paid a fee at the outset. McGregor was contracted into the next two Star Wars films before he filmed The Phantom Menace, and can expect to earn little more than th \u00a31m he received for the first prequel. Before he met Lucas, McGregor was making smaller amounts on low-budget films such as Little Voice, South from Hell's Kitchen and the Nick Leeson biopic, Rogue Trader. But he has entered the big league and is set to play the lead alongside Nicole Kidman in Baz Luhrmann's Le Moulin Rouge. His post-Star Wars celebrity will prove rewarding, netting a reported \u00a34m. He also holds a five per cent stake in the production company Natural Nylon Entertainment. 17. David Coulthard, 28 Formula One driver. \u00a38 million. As Coulthard lines up on the grid for today's Melbourne grand prix he will know that this is his make-or-break season. His wealth is enormous but as a driver he has never quite lived up to expectations. Although he finished third last year - bringing him \u00a33m - observers are looking to him to challenge for top slot this season. If he doesn't, he could lose his seat in the McLaren car next year. As with other formula one drivers, Coulthard is barred from carrying non-McLaren sponsors, but sources say that the Scotsman still commands \u00a31.5m per season from non-racing activities. 18. Robbie Fowler, 24 Footballer, Liverpool &amp; England. \u00a37 million. Even if he was only paid by the game, Robbie Fowler would still be a wealthy man. His seven games since the start of the season would have raked in at least \u00a3378,000 before tax. Fortunately for the injury-ravaged striker, he gets \u00a354,000 a week regardless. As the highest-paid footballer in the country, it was not surprising that a rumoured transfer to Arsenal came to nothing. His long-standing ankle problem was also a factor. He also picks up \u00a3500,000 per year from his boot deal with Nike. Dogged for several years by drugs rumours, which he has always denied, Fowler has recently become a father and started to settle down. 19. Shaznay Lewis, 24 Singer/songwriter, All Saints. \u00a37 million. All Saints have amassed 1.8m album sales in the UK, and a total of eight million worldwide. Lewis, as the band's songwriter, has seen the majority of the royalties from these sales. The new single, 'Pure Shores', appears on the soundtrack to The Beach. And although they did not receive an advance for the single, the film's high profile will pay dividends for the new album's summer release. It is likely that the other All Saints will have seen little more than \u00a32m each from the band's success and that will not be boosted too much by the acting debut of the Appleton sisters - Nicole and Natalie - in the film Honest. 20. Kate Winslet, 25 Actress. \u00a36 million. Despite breaking into the Hollywood mainstream of late, Winslet has seen her fair share of bad deals. Titanic, her last appearance as an unknown, netted her a \u00a3200,000 fee plus a rumoured \u00a3600,000 bonus. Hideous Kinky was propped up by Winslet's own cash and proved something of a commercial failure, but that has not prevented her being able to command \u00a33m a film. Winslet plays the title role in the forthcoming remake of Emile Zola's novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin and symbolic of her desire to get more involved behind the scenes, she also works as an executive producer. The executive role will provide her with a fee, and she will benefit from the kudos of being seen to be active behind the scenes. She is also starring alongside Harvey Keitel as Ruth in Jane Campion's Holy Smoke, and Quills, a film about erotic literature - two films which will increase her bankability.",

      "body": "<p>21. <b>Greg Rusedski</b>, 26</p> <p>Tennis player. \u00a36 million.</p> <p>One blazing month, during which he won close to \u00a31m, turned 1999 into a more lucrative year than at one stage seemed possible. The man with a smokin' serve had failed to win a title all year, and had suffered a humiliating defeat in the US Open after he led Todd Martin by two sets to love, and served for the match in the third. But on a pacy court in Munich, he thundered aside all opposition to win the Grand Slam Cup and more than \u00a3800,000 in prize money. He spent the rest of October picking up further fat cheques in Basle, Vienna and Stuttgart, so that his year's winnings were more than \u00a31.3m (taking his career total to \u00a34.1m).</p> <p>On the commercial front, he traded in an international contract with Nike and another with Wilson, for a 10-year clothing and racket association with Donnay that could on a good year - a grand slam victory - earn him \u00a31m. The basic deal pays a retainer of \u00a3200,000 per season, with a guarantee of $1m for a grand slam win, or more if he ever became world number one. He has other sponsorship deals with Austin Reed, Jaguar and the internet provider Freeserve, which top up his annual income by close to \u00a31m. Like rival Tim Henman, he too got married in December to a Lucy, drama student Lucy Connor.</p> <p>22. <b>Ryan Giggs</b>, 26</p> <p>Footballer, Manchester United &amp; Wales. \u00a36 million.</p> <p>One of the old men of the United dressing room, Giggs turned 26 last November. A regular in the team since he was 17, he has won everything at United. He is under contract until 2003, but will be among the stars beating a path to Sir Alex Ferguson's door at the end of the season, looking for an improvement on his basic \u00a31m salary in light of the decision to double his team mate Roy Keane's wages to \u00a352,000 per week from next season.</p> <p>A \u00a3300,000 bonus for winning the treble last season will have satisfied his passion for fast cars. But his main off-field wealth comes via Reebok which struck a six-year deal with Giggs valued at \u00a36.5m in 1996 - he receives \u00a3475,000 per season for wearing the boots and the rest of the money comes from personal appearances and advertising.</p> <p>Wherever that money goes, it is not being paid into Ryan Giggs Limited, the company created by the footballer in 1993 - an investigation of its accounts to the end of 1998 reveals assets of \u00a3861,000 but no sign of his salary or off-field payments. Already wealthy beyond his dreams the Cardiff-born Giggs would have to leave Old Trafford to secure a really big pay day - and he shows no sign of wanting to move on.</p> <p>23. <b>Liam Howlett</b>, 28</p> <p>Singer/songwriter, the Prodigy. \u00a36 million.</p> <p>Howlett, as the creative force behind dance act the Prodigy, has netted an estimated \u00a36m from the band's worldwide sales. He receives a larger proportion of the sale value than the rest of the band and also reaps publishing royalties. Historically, the band's most lucrative deal came from an arrangement with the Allied Domecq-owned drinks brand Ballantine, which sponsored the band's tour from 1996 to spring 1998. The deal, it transpires, was worth less than the \u00a33m initially reported, and is partly why Howlett's value has been reduced. His income has not been helped by the Prodigy's Bulgarian tour, which saw little profit and poor sales for his own solo remix collection, The Dirt Chamber Sessions.</p> <p>24. <b>Duncan Ferguson</b>, 28</p> <p>Footballer, Newcastle United. \u00a35 million.</p> <p>Ferguson has followed, almost to the letter, the caricature career of a professional footballer. He showed amazing promise at Dundee before his first big transfer - a \u00a34m move to Glasgow Rangers. A second major transfer - a \u00a34.3m move to Everton - was followed by a brief spell in prison for assault. He then prematurely retired as a Scottish international, settled down and started training homing pigeons. Twelve months ago he was on the move again to help balance the Everton books. This time the transfer fee was \u00a38m and the buyer was Newcastle. Having never asked for a transfer but been involved in deals worth \u00a316.3m, Ferguson would have picked up signing-on fees of around \u00a32m during his career. A four-and-a-half year contract at Newcastle will pay \u00a39m before tax - \u00a32m per season. 3 entertainers continue on page 50</p> <p>25. <b>Steve Mcmanaman</b>, 28</p> <p>Footballer, Real Madrid &amp; England. \u00a35 million.</p> <p>The former Liverpool striker has already picked up the first \u00a33m tranche of his \u00a315m, five-year, Real Madrid contract plus the new home and all the trappings of superstardom. His \u00a360,000 per week deal puts the English league pay scale in the shade - not least because he will be paying substantially less tax than his former Liverpool colleagues. He has won over the Madrid fans with a string of good performances in an underperforming side and may form part of England's Euro 2000 squad if he stays free of injury.</p> <p>26. <b>Tim Henman</b>, 25</p> <p>Tennis player. \u00a35 million.</p> <p>No rags-to-riches story here, the gently nurtured son of a country solicitor and his dress-designer wife was never going to be short of a wad or two. His marriage last December to Lucy Heald, also from a comfortably off family from the home counties, gave him added security. But he has made the most of his great natural talent as an athlete to earn far more from whacking a tennis ball about than he would ever have done had he gone, say, into his father's business. For the first time in his career, his world ranking dropped in 1999 as he slipped from seventh to 12th, but his winnings for the year still came to just under \u00a31m, taking his career total to more than \u00a33m. He is now midway through a five-year, performance-related contract with Adidas that is expected to gross him \u00a34.5m.</p> <p>There are also tie-ups with Slazenger, Mercedes, HSBC and Robinson's, which boost his annual income by at least another \u00a31.2m.</p> <p>27. <b>Michael Owen</b>, 20</p> <p>Footballer, Liverpool &amp; England. \u00a34.5 million.</p> <p>Although he has had an injury-wrecked season - he has played only 60 minutes with strike partner Robbie Fowler all season, has had five hamstring injuries in 15 months and may miss Euro 2000 - it has not affected the earning power of the golden boy of English football.</p> <p>He has ongoing deals with Walkers crisps, Pepsi, publisher HarperCollins, Jaguar cars and computer games manufacturer Eidos. His exclusive agreement with Umbro to be a 'brand endorser' runs until 2004 although there has already been speculation that it will be renegotiated and doubled to pay Owen \u00a31m per season before too long. Last year we were conservative in our valuation of Owen and we continue to be so. He doubles his \u00a31m basic salary with off -field endorsements but his agents, the SFX Sports Group, seem determined to ensure that his earning potential is not exploited to the extent that he suffers the sort of burn-out his hamstrings are currently experiencing.</p> <p>28. <b>Stan Collymore</b>, 29</p> <p>Footballer, Leicester. \u00a34 million.</p> <p>Treatment for depression at the Priory Clinic was probably the most expensive thing in the life of Stanley Victor Collymore in the past 12 months and even then Aston Villa picked up part of the bill. His stop-start career - he has attracted \u00a315m in transfer fees - stalled at Villa and the troubled striker has been off limits to any commercial deals since attacking his then girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar during the 1998 World Cup. But Stanley's contract at Villa guaranteed that he would be the highest-paid player and before his departure to Midlands rivals Leicester in February he was earning a basic of \u00a320,000 per week - although he was not eligible for win or scoring bonuses because boss John Gregory refused to play him. His more modest \u00a312,000 per week contract at Leicester is based on performances - and so Collymore now literally has to play for his money. His overall value remains unchanged since last year.</p> <p>29 <b>Chris Sutton</b>, 27</p> <p>Footballer, Chelsea &amp; occasionally England. \u00a34 million.</p> <p>Having celebrated birthday number 27 last Friday, Sutton will be hoping that it brings better fortune. He was a near inclusion on last year's Young Rich list but fell just short. But his \u00a310m transfer from Blackburn to Chelsea in the summer and \u00a335,000 per week wages changes that. Unfortunately the improvement in his bank balance has not been matched by any on-field success and he has not been topping up his earnings via scoring bonuses - just one goal in the Premiership by the end of February. He was once the most expensive footballer in Britain when Blackburn paid Norwich \u00a35m for his services in 1994, and in true football style he celebrated by spending a night in the cells of a Norwich police station. Last summer he became Chelsea's most expensive English recruit and arguably its biggest flop - at the time of going to press there is speculation that Sutton could be an \u00a38m target for Celtic.</p> <p>It would further swell his bank balance but do little for his reputation. Having refused to turn out for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle, there is talk that he could return to the England fold - but only if he starts scoring. His main commercial off-field activity is with Umbro - a deal which pays an annual retainer of \u00a3250,000 until 2002.</p> <p>30. <b>Jude Law</b>, 28</p> <p>Actor. \u00a34 million.</p> <p>With the exception of 1997's Gattaca, Law has only recently moved away from the low-budget British productions in which he made his name. eXistenZ, David Cronenberg's sci-fi epic, launched him into the Hollywood mainstream. But four years of relatively big cheques do start to add up. His Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley for which he was paid \u00a3500,000 - will catapult him further. Its high-profile has already led to his agents now asking for a reported \u00a33.1m per film. He didn't get that for his next big role - alongside Ed Harris, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz in Jean-Jacques Annaud's Enemy at the Gates - for which he received between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m. Law also has a 30 per cent stake in the production company Natural Nylon Entertainment, in which Ewan McGregor and Jonny Lee Miller also hold 5 per cent stakes. Natural Nylon has yet to make any money, but its first major production begins this year.</p>",

      "body": "<p>1 and 2. <b>Victoria Beckham</b>, 25 Singer, aka 'Posh Spice'. \u00a325.5 million.</p> <p><b>David Beckham</b>, 24 Footballer, Manchester United and England. \u00a37 million.</p> <p>Combined value \u00a332.5 million</p> <p>Already famous, David Beckham gained worldwide notoriety the night he kicked an Argentine while playing for England in the 1998 World Cup finals. An audience of millions watched the glamour boy of English football march off the pitch in disgrace and on to the cover of virtually every magazine in the world.</p> <p>Just 13 days later, back in the UK, a company called Yandella was created with two directors Victoria 'Posh Spice' Adams and her mum Jackie. It is described as a 'general commercial company' and has until April to produce its first set of accounts. But on 1 March 1999 came the clearest signal yet of the true purpose of the company when Beckham became Yandella's third director.</p> <p>The company has been created to maximise earnings from the future joint business activities of the new king and queen of celebrity. Among the first monies should be the \u00a32.5m paid by television production company Planet 24 to film the run-up to their wedding last year.</p> <p>This is the family business. Of more interest to Posh and Beckham watchers will be the role of her mother, Jackie, as company secretary and director. In theory that gives the Adams family a two-to-one majority at board meetings.</p> <p>The name Yandella has no significance. It was an existing company bought 'off-the-shelf' but a source close to the couple says: 'The company was created for the service of these two individuals and their role together. Whatever that role may prove to be.' It provides the foundation for future ventures selling the 'Beckham' brand name. He has a string of contracts which more than treble his \u00a31.3m annual on-field earnings - the most lucrative and long-term being with Adidas.</p> <p>But he is a long way from fully exploiting his worldwide celebrity. Significantly he is expected to have both a longer career and greater worldwide earning potential than his wife. Yandella has been created to ensure that no deal is overlooked or opportunity spurned. And all of this is happening at a time when he looks like leaving Manchester United before his contract ends in May 2002.</p> <p>Beckham is under pressure from his wife to move south - and under even greater pressure from United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to spend more time in Manchester. She has been quoted as saying Beckham is not paid enough - not a view shared by Ferguson. Beckham has already been linked with a \u00a320m transfer to Arsenal, complete with a \u00a33m signing-on fee and wages of \u00a360,000 per week. But a host of Italian and Spanish clubs would be willing to break the world transfer record of \u00a332m to sign him.</p> <p>Underlining his potential earning power, one City analyst suggests that in the future some of the world's top footballers will be floated on the stock market. 'It is a radical idea but one that people are tentatively discussing,' says the analyst, 'not with the players but as an academic exercise.'</p> <p>Such a move for Beckham would dwarf previous earnings and again Yandella could provide the basis for such a floated company. The Manchester Utd star has a separate business, David Beckham Ltd. Its most recent figures - those to the end of April 1998 - show assets of almost \u00a3400,000.</p> <p>Like many big earners, Beckham will have offshore accounts and other investments. This valuation is based on his on-field earnings of \u00a31.3m last year plus his existing commercial deals. It also takes into account his shopaholic tendencies -he spent almost \u00a3800,000 last year. But then if you are being groomed by your in-laws to be the 21st-century's first icon you can afford it.</p> <p>3. <b>Melanie Chisholm</b>, 26</p> <p>Singer, aka 'Sporty Spice'. \u00a322.5 million.</p> <p>Her private company, Red Girl Productions Limited, is the vehicle she uses to filter her Spice Girl wages from the central pot and, along with the others, to last autumn she had seen \u00a321m. Given the time it takes revenue from touring and record sales to reach the artist, she can expect to make much more for the last financial year on account of the band's US tour and the 1997 \u00a3100m film, Spice World.</p> <p>Industry sources suggest Virgin is unlikely to make any money from her debut LP, but the solo projects do allow Virgin (which handles all the solo projects) to make money out of the girls without relentlessly flogging the Spice Girls as a product. Chisholm joined the nest-building phase of the rest of the band when she purchased a flat in Mount Vernon, Hampstead for \u00a31.5m.</p> <p>4. <b>Melanie Brown</b>, 24</p> <p>Singer, aka 'Scary Spice'. \u00a322 million.</p> <p>The first to get married, the first to give birth and now the first to be tripping the light fantastic to the divorce courts, Scary has had a bad 12 months on a personal front, which has provided priceless tabloid fodder.</p> <p>Her brief marriage to Jimmy Gulzar seems to be coming to an end, with divorce lawyers queuing up to suggest that the dancer will be looking for a \u00a31.5m settlement to accept the divorce. It seems likely that someone with Scary's advisers would have drawn up a watertight pre-nuptial agreement restricting any settlement to much less than \u00a31.5m but love can do funny things to people.</p> <p>Other than her stint as presenter on BBC2's Pure Naughty, her anchoring of the MOBO awards and a single with hip hop's Missy Elliott, this has been a quiet year financially for Mel B - which is reflected in the fact that her valuation has remained unchanged. Instead she has had to sit at home and count her Spice Girl money rolling in from previous tours, records and merchandising contracts.</p> <p>And roll in it has. Along with the other four, she picked up wages of \u00a36.2m to August 1998. That annual figure, swelled to at least \u00a310m by monies from merchandising, film rights and other commercial spin-offs, has earned her \u00a321m in Spice Girl earnings so far.</p> <p>5. <b>Emma Bunton</b>, 24</p> <p>Singer, aka 'Baby Spice'. \u00a322 million.</p> <p>Bunton has perhaps had the least success in establishing a solo identity. Her only solo record to date, 'What I Am', reached number two in the charts. She was at the centre of the recent court case with Aprilia Scooters - the company alleged breach of contract claiming that the Spices knew Geri Halliwell was leaving before signing a sponsorship agreement that involved all five of them - and demanded \u00a31.4m in compensation.</p> <p>Spice Girls Limited counter-sued for \u00a3212,500 - and lost. In evidence Bunton was forced to admit to 'a bad memory', extending to the fact she couldn't remember if Halliwell had told her she was leaving the then biggest band in the world. Hopefully, she can remember where she has put her fortune. If she is in any doubt, much of it is in Monsta Productions, her wholly owned private company. The purchase of a \u00a32.5m penthouse in a converted Victorian workhouse in Hampstead will have soaked up some of her earnings.</p> <p>6. <b>Gary Barlow</b>, 29</p> <p>Musician. \u00a320 million.</p> <p>Barlow's revenues and royalties from Take That remain his main source of wealth despite the fact the band split up four years ago. He has done superbly from the band's 15m worldwide album sales and his first solo LP, Open Road, which he both wrote and co-produced, sold 3.5m copies in its first year.</p> <p>But he has been relatively quiet in the past 12 months and, in a move which suggests he believes his future may lie in a different direction, Barlow has recently filmed a cameo performance for ITV's Heartbeat. But along with so many other first-time actors, Barlow, who considers himself worth \u00a319m, can be content in the knowledge that even if the acting career doesn't take off he can always go back to the day job.</p> <p>6. <b>Geri Halliwell</b>, 27</p> <p>Singer, formerly 'Ginger Spice'. \u00a319.6 million.</p> <p>A trawl through Companies House records reveals that although she quit the Spice Girls in May 1998 - comparing it to 'leaving a marriage' - Geraldine Estelle Halliwell remained a director of six Spice Girls companies until 30 November 1999. She also retained a 20 per cent holding in Spice Girl Limited - the umbrella company for the entire group's other activities.</p> <p>This is not just a technical oversight but a sign that while she left the Spice Girls with a \u00a315m 'farewell' cheque, it was not full and final settlement. The deal also involved ongoing royalties for merchandising, tours and the Spice World movie. So although she claimed not to be a party to the recent legal case involving Aprilia Scooters (see above) she could be said to have had a direct financial interest as a shareholder of the company when the case was first brought against Spice Girls Limited.</p> <p>On leaving the Spice Girls she signed a solo recording deal worth \u00a33.2m which was soon followed by a \u00a3550,000 deal with publisher Transworld for her book If Only - the US rights were picked up by Dell which added a further \u00a3500,000 to her coffers. Her solo LP, Schizophonic, went platinum: these 300,000 copies barely approach the three million copies that Spiceworld sold - but then she doesn't have to split the proceeds five ways either.</p> <p>Halliwell's profile, thanks to the ruthless exploitation of her personal life in the tabloid media, is second only to Posh - she turned up to give evidence at the Aprilia high court case brandishing an ad for her latest single.</p> <p>Her valuation has risen over the past year in recognition of the advance from her record deal finally hitting her bank balance and in recognition of the extra 18 months of Spice Girl money, which has only just come to light.</p> <p>8. <b>Jay Kay</b>, 30</p> <p>Musician. \u00a319 million.</p> <p>Lead singer of Jamiroquai and fiance to the inexhaustible Denise Van Outen, Jay Kay has been one of the big sellers of the past decade. Confidence and magnitude have followed him since his signing to Sony on an eight-album deal in 1993. He scooped a \u00a3100,000 advance on the strength of one song. His second album, Travelling Without Moving, sold seven million copies worldwide, while the current LP, Synchronised, has been number one in most European countries and exceeded sales of four million. Extensive touring has earned him \u00a32m, while his net wealth is augmented by Horsenden Manor in Buckinghamshire, valued at close to \u00a32m, and a fleet of cars worth \u00a31.5m.</p> <p>9. <b>Alan Shearer</b>, 29</p> <p>Footballer, Newcastle United &amp; England. \u00a317 million.</p> <p>If his value was measured in charisma, Shearer wouldn't be on this list. Fortunately for the England captain, who retires from international football this summer, his career is based on goal scoring rather than wisecracking. He was one of the first players to appreciate the commercial opportunities football offered in the early Nineties and he has exploited it fully.</p> <p>His Newcastle contract guarantees that he will always be the top paid player at the club - the arrival of Duncan Ferguson last season moved both players on to \u00a340,000 per week. But it's off the field where he has proved even more shrewd, doubling his on-field earnings with a string of sponsorship and advertising contracts with the likes of Umbro, McDonald's, BT and Lucozade. Shearer, whose combined career transfer fees come in at just under \u00a319m, signed an unprecedented 15 year boots and clothing deal with Umbro in 1997 that has so far netted him almost \u00a32m. The Umbro deal could be worth a total of \u00a320m over the 15 years. The Geordie has even started to take himself less seriously. A recent McDonald's advert included a young employee commenting that 'he is a bit boring' - but then he does earn a minimum \u00a3500,000 for each ad.</p> <p>10. <b>Prince Naseem Hamed</b>, 26</p> <p>Boxer and self-proclaimed 'king of the ring'. \u00a317 million.</p> <p>Although he will have collected another handsome cheque for last night's fight against South Africa's Vuyani Bungu, we have kept Hamed's valuation at the same level as last year. Partly because he has not been having the high-prize fights that were expected but also because of his lavish spending habits.</p> <p>There is also the question of pinning down a real value for Hamed who keeps much of his money offshore, well out of the glare of those who scrutinise public accounts. All his fight payments and commercial spin-offs - through organisations such as Naseem Hamed Promotions - are related to the quality of opponents. Bungu would not have been as big a pull as Junior Jones - the man who was supposed to have been last night's opponent until negotiations broke down. It has been a comparatively low-key year for Hamed financially. Although his contracts continue with Adidas and HBO, none the less he will have to start taking on some of those more serious opponents - especially in the US - if his already huge earnings are to grow further.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You wait ages for one to come and then three arrive at once. Last week's news that three Internet companies are to offer unlimited online access made front-page headlines and met with a warm welcome from Downing Street as a big step in its drive to ensure we are all online within five years. </p> <p>The reactions seemed justified: unlimited or 'unmetered' access is seen as tremendously important by UK Internet companies. For years they have looked longingly at the US, where users have been able to surf with abandon in return for a one-off charge. Experts argue that UK Internet usage suffers by comparison. Online users here are conscious that they are paying by the minute, and thus limit their use of the Internet. US users spend twice as much time online as their UK counterparts. </p> <p>But the decisions by US Internet search engine <a href=\"http://www.altavista.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Alta Vista</a>, cable company <a href=\"http://www.ntl.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">NTL</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bt.com\" target=\"_new\">BT</a> to offer unlimited access will have repercussions beyond turning us into a generation of Netheads. The moves can be compared to seismic shifts in the ocean floor, creating choppy waters above. The question now is how many will stay afloat? </p> <p>The answer lies in which companies can make the 'free' model pay. Until now big Internet success stories such as <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.com\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a>, the Internet service provider (ISP) that last week entered the FTSE 100, have generated a significant proportion of their revenue from connection charges. Each time you access the Internet through Freeserve, the ISP makes a few pence. Freeserve believes it makes 40p per user per month from this. At the last set of interim results, Freeserve had a turnover of just over \u00a37 million, and roughly half of this came from connection charges. </p> <p>Unmetered Internet access means this business model becomes difficult to justify. Surfers will opt to pay the likes of Alta Vista relatively small one-off fees for unlimited use, leading to what is known as 'bill shock' in the trade. As a result, Freeserve's shares fell by nearly 20 per cent at the start of this week as analysts speculated that it would have to subsidise the cost of unlimited access if it was to retain its market leading position. </p> <p>This may have been a knee-jerk reaction. Freeserve has been wise to the notion that the ISP cash cow could not be milked forever, and has been desperately attempting to turn itself into a 'portal' - a must-visit Internet destination that users go to on a regular basis. To do this the company has teamed up with a raft of content providers and e-tailers: now whatever you are looking for, a visit to Freeserve will help you find it. The intention is to make money by exploiting this position through selling online advertising and e-commerce. </p> <p>Since Freeserve has approaching 1.7 million users - outstripping its nearest rival, AOL Europe, by around 100,000 - it should be in a strong position to make the most of this intention, even when it succumbs to the inevitable and offers its own unlimited-access version. But Freeserve's problem - and ultimately that facing all those who intend to offer unlimited access in the future - is how to stop surfers straying away from the portal. There is nothing to stop you using an ISP's unlimited service to access the Internet and then, having passed through its gateway, leaving it to go elsewhere on the world wide web. </p> <p>Until now, the ISPs could console themselves that they were making money from the connection side of things. Now this seems doomed to disappear. Continuing to charge significant amounts for access would result in users simply switching to an ISP that offers an unmetered service. 'If companies charge high tolls, they're going to get run over,' said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America. </p> <p>Figures show how serious the threat of wandering users is to even the Internet's biggest players. Miles Saltiel, Internet analyst at WestLB Panmure, said in a recent report: 'In January, Freeserve had 35 per cent of the access market ,but under 15 per cent of total site visits: in other words, users are logging on to Freeserve then going elsewhere.' </p> <p>The challenge for the major players now is to stop their flock straying, so that e- commerce and online advertising revenues are sufficiently high to compensate for subsidising users' surfing time. </p> <p>Two things are clear: content and connectivity are the new kings. Sounds familiar? Strangely enough these are also the key drivers that bring in the bucks for conventional television broadcasters. Just as viewers remain loyal to BBC1, Channel 4 or Sky Sports 1 - because they like their programmes, which can be watched easily and cheaply - so the online portals reckon the same must be true for their business strategies. 'What you're now seeing over here is the Internet equivalent of the TV licence. Just like TV, people are paying a certain amount of money upfront in return for unlimited access,' said Alex Birch, a director of Internet specialist OC&amp;C Strategy Consulting. </p> <p>Birch argues that some of the big US Internet portals are even starting to look like conventional broadcasters. 'It's the model the portals are trying to drive towards in the US. Look at what MSN (Microsoft's portal) is doing with its channels,' Birch said. </p> <p>The most obvious example of this convergence of television and Internet business models came with the recent ground-breaking merger between America Online and Time Warner. Analysts now speculate about just how long it will be before a raft of Time Warner companies make their services available solely over the AOL network - anathema to all those who argue the Web's raison d' tre should be as a completely open system. </p> <p>Alta Vista's strategy is similar to the AOL-Time deal in that its intention is to turn the search engine into a mega portal that directs users to content and services provided by its sister companies. The search engine is 83 per cent owned by US venture capital giant CMGi, which holds, or has stakes in, more than 60 other Internet firms. So when you use the Alta Vista search engine, the chances are you will see ads for sites and online services which, not surprisingly, are offered by companies owned by CMGi. </p> <p>Likewise, NTL has ulterior motives for ensuring it encourages more people to sign up for its unlimited services. NTL plans to use the new service, called ntlworld, as a means to develop its wider ambitions. </p> <p>NTL will soon launch its digital cable television package, and is currently bidding for a third-generation mobile licence. The plan is to heavily promote its unlimited Internet access to attract a critical mass of users who can then be migrated on to its other new services. </p> <p>'It's a great opportunity to own customers,' said Janice Hughes of new media consultancy Spectrum. 'NTL is using the Internet as a marketing tool.' </p> <p>And, of course, NTL has its own set of partners and content providers, who will be promoted on ntlworld, a 'world' the company hopes you won't want to leave. 'The service will be fresh, hugely broad and hugely deep,' a spokesman said. 'It won't just sell you a holiday; it'll tell you when the pool's open.' </p> <p>So where does this leave BT? Playing a waiting game for now, seems the likely answer. BT is banned from entering the broadcast market until next year, so opportunities for building its own series of channels to rein users in are limited. Significantly, BT last week signed a deal with Yes TV, a company whose technology will one day see BT stream movies over its network. </p> <p>The worry in the industry, however, is that such new developments will place unprecedented pressure on the telecoms infrastructure. As unlimited access explodes - Birch foresees at least four more ISPs opting for the unmetered model within the next six months - so some of the networks will struggle to cope with the extra traffic. </p> <p>'It will be just like the National Grid. Everyone's watching the World Cup. You get to half-time and everyone goes to make a cup of tea,' said Internet analyst Simon Moores of consultancy The Research Group. 'In order to make unlimited Internet access available, a broadband infrastructure has to be in place. There's no such thing as a free lunch.' </p> <p>Pundits have already been quick to predict that a new subscription model will emerge as a rival to the unmetered service. Users would pay for access to high- quality bandwidth, allowing them to access the Internet at much faster speeds. </p> <p>All these pressures - the need for content, broadband and the ability to change business models almost overnight, not to mention the huge offline costs of promoting the online brand and subsidising free access - suggest that only the biggest players will survive in the Internet world of the future. </p> <p>Consolidation between media, Internet and telecoms companies looks inevitable as the race to carve up the Web begins in earnest. And the free-thinking pioneers of the Internet can only stand by and mutter that it was never meant to be like this. </p> <p><strong>Riding this wave of generosity</strong><br> The explosion in unlimited Internet access is bound to create confusion among consumers. </p> <p>Basically, there will be at least three unlimited products, with their own pricing structures ,on the market in the next few months. Other, perhaps less heavily advertised products, will also come on to the market. </p> <p><strong> Alta Vista's</strong> package is based on a one-off, upfront fee of between \u00a330 and \u00a350 and then an annual fee of between \u00a310 and \u00a320. The company has not finalised the exact pricing structure or set a launch date, which at the moment could be any time within the next three months. </p> <p><strong> BT's SurfTime</strong> package, to be launched on 1 June, offers unmetered access for \u00a329.25 a month for residential customers. Some users might prefer a different package costing \u00a315.25 a month and offering unmetered access in the evenings and at weekends. </p> <p><strong> NTL</strong> , which will be the first to launch an unmetered Internet access package - on 17 April - has two deals, one for those who live in areas that take its cables, another for those who don't. If you live in a cabled area, you pay \u00a39.25 a month for the phone line. Otherwise you pay a one-off charge of \u00a310 for a telephone adaptor that connects to your BT line. Customers have to agree to pay a minimum of \u00a310 a month on normal telephone calls. </p> <p>Andrew Boswell, chief technology officer at ICL, says: 'Read the small print. People may well be confused by a complex choice of bundled Internet and voice tariffs, in much the same way as prospective buyers of mobile phones can be faced with a bewildering array of tariff choices.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "You wait ages for one to come and then three arrive at once. Last week's news that three Internet companies are to offer unlimited online access made front-page headlines and met with a warm welcome from Downing Street as a big step in its drive to ensure we are all online within five years. The reactions seemed justified: unlimited or 'unmetered' access is seen as tremendously important by UK Internet companies. For years they have looked longingly at the US, where users have been able to surf with abandon in return for a one-off charge. Experts argue that UK Internet usage suffers by comparison. Online users here are conscious that they are paying by the minute, and thus limit their use of the Internet. US users spend twice as much time online as their UK counterparts. But the decisions by US Internet search engine Alta Vista, cable company NTL and BT to offer unlimited access will have repercussions beyond turning us into a generation of Netheads. The moves can be compared to seismic shifts in the ocean floor, creating choppy waters above. The question now is how many will stay afloat? The answer lies in which companies can make the 'free' model pay. Until now big Internet success stories such as Freeserve, the Internet service provider (ISP) that last week entered the FTSE 100, have generated a significant proportion of their revenue from connection charges.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It began in the parched earth of Matabeleland, among the cactus and the baobab trees, and ended over lunch in a Park Lane casino, served by long-legged girls in fishnet tights. For two hectic weeks the battle was monitored in every news bulletin, causing anguished debates about press freedom in Parliament and the media - and almost led to the The Observer being sold to Robert Maxwell.</p> <p>The public row between me, as editor of The Observer, and Tiny Rowland, then chief executive of Lonrho, the international conglomerate which had bought the newspaper three years before, grew into a Fleet Street soap opera that overshadowed the tragic human story that provoked it - the suffering of the minority Ndebele people at the hands of the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the Zimbabwe Army.</p> <p>This story may now finally emerge, for the Supreme Court has ordered President Mugabe to publish an official report into the atrocities which he has suppressed for 16 years. These revelations, if they come on the eve of the general election, set for the end of the month, could even hasten his overthrow.</p> <p>After two decades, during which the economy has been ruined and corruption rife, Mugabe is looking vulnerable. He lost a referendum designed to entrench his constitutional position. In crude moves to boost his popularity, he has been encouraging Africans to take over white farms and has stoked up an international incident with Britain by opening our diplomatic bags in breach of the Vienna Convention.</p> <p>For the first time since independence, however, the opposition has teeth and observers believe he can survive only by moving the electoral goalposts. Mugabe ruled supreme when I met him in April 1984. I went to interview him for the country's fourth anniversary of independence for a current affairs series on Channel 4.

I told Rowland about the visit as a courtesy, since his company had started in the former Rhodesia (hence 'Lonrho') and had major business interests there.</p> <p>That was a mistake, since it gave Rowland an opportunity to ingratiate himself with Mugabe ('I have arranged for my editor to publish an interview in The Observer ') and repair relations that had been damaged by Lonrho's long support for the opposition leader, Joshua Nkomo. (I heard later that Lonrho had also supported Mugabe's Zanu party, but Mugabe never heard about this, because the cash had stuck to the fingers of an emissary who had used it to buy himself a house in Hampstead.)</p> <p>When I arrived in Harare, I was met by Rowland's Zimbabwe 'fixer', Godwin Matatu, who whisked me off for lunch with Lonrho's local board. The interview was clearly to be a Lonrho production and Matatu, a gregarious, alcoholic journalist who died in 1989, was to be my minder.</p> <p>The Mugabe interview was disastrously dull, unusable for television, of interest only to a specialist African magazine (where, in fact, it subsequently appeared). When I asked him if he would consider a political rather than a military solution in Matabeleland, where a curfew had been in force since February, he replied bluntly: 'The solution is a military one. Their grievances are unfounded. The verdict of the voters was cast in 1980. They should have accepted defeat then.' Then he added chillingly: 'The situation in Matabeleland is one that requires a change. The people must be reoriented.'</p> <p>After I had appeared as guest of the week on ZBC, I was recognised by a group of Africans in the lobby of Meikles Hotel. One took me aside conspiratorially: 'You should go to Matabeleland to see what is happening to our people there. There are terrible things.' He hurried away, as if afraid to be overheard.</p> <p>No media had been allowed inside the curfew area for 10 weeks, but there were rumours about brutal treatment of the population by Mugabe's soldiers, ostensibly searching for 'dissidents' from across the Botswana border. I said to Matatu: 'Let's go to Bulawayo in the morning.'</p> <p>We found little sign there of military activity, just the odd 'hippo' armoured personnel carrier trundling along a dirt road with mounted guns, or a truck-load of troops with rocket-propelled grenades on their AK-47 rifles. Rain had made the Lowveld roads almost unpassable.</p> <p>Schoolgirls were marching quietly in green check dresses or lying in the shade; old men scratching with hoes; cattle standing in the dry river beds; goats, donkeys, marmosets, even a kudu bull, dashing across the road.</p> <p>We knew we weren't allowed officially into the curfew area, but asked our driver to brave the roadblocks anyway. We passed three without bother, all manned cheerily by policemen in brown boots, then Matatu did some name-dropping to persuade a tough-looking soldier to let us through. We were able to drive through the no-go areas, past Kezi, Antelope Mine, Bhalagwe Camp - all names, I learned later, that filled the Ndebele with dread. We saw nothing unusual.</p> <p>Around 10pm, there was a call from the hotel reception to say that a man wanted to deliver a letter. An African tapped on the door and handed it over. It read simply: 'Please accompany this friend.' Moving quietly to avoid disturbing Matatu next door, I followed the man to the car park, where a headlight beamed in recognition.</p> <p>I had no idea where I was going, or who with; and nobody knew where I'd gone. I knew instinctively that I couldn't take Matatu with me. Apart from the Lonrho connection, he was a Shona and close to the government and his presence would have deterred people from speaking honestly.</p> <p>I climbed nervously into the car and was taken in silence for several miles out of town into the curfew area. There - after a semi-comic interlude in which we gave a lift to a policeman - we stopped at a remote house, pipped horns for ages, and finally changed cars with another man.</p> <p>He took us for another long ride to a religious mission where, for much of the night, I was given a series of eyewitness accounts, sworn affidavits and signed statements from victims of the Matabeleland atrocities. These were graphic, horrific and profoundly moving.</p> <p>One name kept recurring, as in a nightmare. Brigadier Shiri, known as Black Jesus, was head of the Fifth Brigade. And there was one recurring story, about a major who held up a dead baby and told villagers: 'This is what will happen to your babies if you help dissidents.' He then dropped the tiny corpse in the dust.</p> <p>Back in the car again, I met a man from Esigodoni village who had been beaten close to death by agents of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) in front of his family. They were warned they would be shot if they uttered a sound. 'They began beating us with sticks and guns, bayoneting us, burning plastic against our skin while our hands and mouths were secured. They tore curtains, put cushions into our mouths. We were tortured for about four hours.'</p> <p>A man called Jason was brought to the house. He had been chopping trees at Welonke when two soldiers turned up with fixed bayonets and whips on their belts. They asked if he and his wife had seen any dissidents and grew increasingly angry when they said they hadn't. They beat his wife and grandmother and took him away.</p> <p>Neighbours were collected and they all marched on, their progress broken by periodic beatings and a fight they were forced to stage for the soldiers' entertainment. At the village school they shot two children who had tried to run away. Eventually nine of them were forced to dig a hole to a depth of two or three feet and ordered to jump into it.</p> <p>Jason told me: 'The commander leaned against a tree, opened his radio cassette and shot five men. On the grave we put branches. I also saw a big grave which had stones in it. There are 16 buried in this grave.'</p> <p>Earlier I had come across Peter Godwin, of the Sunday Times, who said bodies had been thrown down a nearby mineshaft owned by Lonrho. (Later, Roy Hattersley was sued by Rowland for making this claim in a speech - what Rowland never knew was that I had helped draft Hattersley's speech.)</p> <p>Godwin had already got some atrocity stories into print, but he was inhibited by the fact that he couldn't betray his presence in the curfew area for fear of being expelled or, as a Zimbabwean himself, suffering even worse retribution. Once he understood that I hadn't been sent by Rowland to put a Mugabe spin on the situation, we exchanged useful information.</p> <p>I returned to the hotel at dawn, checked out without waking Matatu, then flew to London via Harare, arriving on Saturday morning with my story written. While in Harare I had two conversations. One was with a military attach\u00e9 at the British High Commission, who wasn't at all surprised by the news from Matabeleland.</p> <p>The other was with a South African director of Lonrho, Nick Kruger, who wasn't surprised either. 'What you have discovered, Donald,' he said, 'is the eternal truth of Africa. Stuff them, then they stuff you. For centuries we stuffed the blacks; now it's their turn to stuff us. The Ndebele stuffed the Shona; now it's the Shonas' turn. '</p> <p>My dilemma on returning - should I publish an anodyne interview with Mugabe or tell the truth about Matabeleland, thereby damaging the interests of my proprietor? - has since been written up as a classic case by the Institute of Global Ethics. For me, there was no choice.</p> <p>I decided to ring Tiny around 5pm on Saturday, too late for him to do anything to stop publication, but before he could hear the news from anyone else. He slammed the telephone down after threatening the direst revenge.</p> <p>Next morning I turned on the BBC eight o'clock news to hear my story condemned as lies in an official statement by Mugabe, supported by a letter of apology from Rowland: 'I take full responsibility for what in my view was discourteous, disingenuous and wrong in the editor of a serious newspaper widely read in Africa'. He described me as 'an incompetent reporter' and announced that I would be dismissed.</p> <p>I went ahead with a planned holiday to Guernsey, but quickly returned on the advice of Lord Goodman, the former Observer chairman, who said I must be seen on the bridge of my ship. The story was front-page news for a fortnight, 'the most entertaining hullabaloo', as one writer put it, 'since Harry Evans fell out with Rupert Murdoch'.</p> <p>Rowland wrote me an open letter, which he distributed to all papers before I could see it, saying Lonrho would not go on supporting a failing editor who showed no concern for their commercial interests. I replied in kind, pointing out that the circulation had actually gone up by 22 per cent in the eight years I had been editor. The Daily Mail published both letters in full under the headlines 'Dear Donald' and 'Dear Tiny'.</p> <p>Rowland insisted that I should go back to Zimbabwe for a longer investigation. I refused, on the grounds that I had already established the truth of my story and that to do so would endanger the lives of my sources.</p> <p>The Foreign Office, more concerned about relations with Mugabe than with human rights and doubtless sensitive that Britain had provided some training for the Fifth Brigade, was briefing against me. I learnt this from Prince Charles, with whom I happened to have lunch at that time. 'The Foreign Office tell me you were wrong about Matabeleland,' he said airily. I ate my soup in silence.</p> <p>Not all the papers were on my side. Paul Johnson said editors had no business trying to be reporters. John Junor wrote: 'If Mr Trelford truly feels that way about Mr Rowland, wouldn't it be more honourable for him to stop accepting Mr Rowland's money?' The Times suggested I had forced a showdown deliberately. The Daily Telegraph said: 'Those who pay the piper must be expected to demand some influence over the choice of tunes he plays.'</p> <p>The Guardian said the paper should 'find its salvation where the people who write the cheques and the people who write the words can work together'. This proved difficult at The Observer when Lonrho announced it was withdrawing financial support. Provoked by a ruling from The Observer 's independent directors that Rowland had interfered improperly, it put a hard-faced accountant in the office to stop me spending money.</p> <p>This brought questions in Parliament. When Peter Shore for Labour asked Norman Tebbit what he planned to do to protect the editorial independence of the editor of The Observer, the Secretary for Trade and Industry clearly enjoyed saying 'Nothing'. This was soon after the paper's revelations about Mark Thatcher's business connections with Oman.</p> <p>The Observer 's journalists were highly supportive of their editor - until Rowland let it be known he was planning to sell the paper to Maxwell. A meeting at Claridges was announced for the next day. I knew Rowland would never sell to Maxwell and this was just a bluff to frighten the journalists. If so, it certainly worked.</p> <p>I was interested to hear an interview with Maxwell about The Observer on my car radio. He 'greatly admired' me, he said, and would retain me as editor. Then, asked what he would have done about the Mark Thatcher stories, he paused and replied in his deepest tones: 'I'd have stamped on him.'</p> <p>By now I felt the paper was being damaged and something had to be done to break the deadlock. So I wrote to Rowland offering my resignation - 'I could not allow the paper's future and the prospects of its staff to be jeopardised by my personal position, which sadly seems to be all that stands in the way of the paper's development.'</p> <p>Rowland seized the olive branch and we made up over an edgy lunch in the incongruous ambience of one of Lonrho's London casinos. Undeterred by the pop music and scantily dressed females, we concocted a priceless statement that we shared an affection for three things - Africa, The Observer and each other.</p> <p>For us and for the paper, that was the end of a remarkable and in some ways entertaining episode. For the people of Matabeleland, however, it provided only brief illumination before the darkness came again.</p> <p>\u0095 Donald Trelford was editor of The Observer from 1975 to 1993 and is now Professor of Journalism Studies at Sheffield University</p>",

For two hectic weeks the battle was monitored in every news bulletin, causing anguished debates about press freedom in Parliament and the media - and almost led to the The Observer being sold to Robert Maxwell. The public row between me, as editor of The Observer, and Tiny Rowland, then chief executive of Lonrho, the international conglomerate which had bought the newspaper three years before, grew into a Fleet Street soap opera that overshadowed the tragic human story that provoked it - the suffering of the minority Ndebele people at the hands of the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the Zimbabwe Army. This story may now finally emerge, for the Supreme Court has ordered President Mugabe to publish an official report into the atrocities which he has suppressed for 16 years. These revelations, if they come on the eve of the general election, set for the end of the month, could even hasten his overthrow. After two decades, during which the economy has been ruined and corruption rife, Mugabe is looking vulnerable. He lost a referendum designed to entrench his constitutional position. In crude moves to boost his popularity, he has been encouraging Africans to take over white farms and has stoked up an international incident with Britain by opening our diplomatic bags in breach of the Vienna Convention. For the first time since independence, however, the opposition has teeth and observers believe he can survive only by moving the electoral goalposts. Mugabe ruled supreme when I met him in April 1984. I went to interview him for the country's fourth anniversary of independence for a current affairs series on Channel 4. I also planned to write a piece for The Observer. I told Rowland about the visit as a courtesy, since his company had started in the former Rhodesia (hence 'Lonrho') and had major business interests there. That was a mistake, since it gave Rowland an opportunity to ingratiate himself with Mugabe ('I have arranged for my editor to publish an interview in The Observer ') and repair relations that had been damaged by Lonrho's long support for the opposition leader, Joshua Nkomo.

      "body": "<p>It was another wonderful week on the Net. Free this, free that and even free promises of universal surfage from Tony Blair. Who cares about the fine print when everyone's scenting zillions? But maybe Fleet Street and the BBC should start to care: they'll be going to war soon over this uniquely rich greenfield site. </p> <p>The warning figures are there for the Beeb, buried in another of the reports they love to commission from McKinsey. Net usage in America is growing almost exponentially, and it's beginning to hurt TV viewing figures. Now such hurt is coming to a living room nearer home. You can't surf and cook couch potatoes at the same time. You have to have a huge stake in the new media, because it will be a huge part of your future. </p> <p>And, of course, top newspaper executives have identical research forebodings shivering the timbers on their office desks. Here the warnings are starker yet. Five or 10 years on, will there even be a market place for printed words on paper? </p> <p>Migration to the Net is not some optional extra: you neglect defensive action at your peril. You have to be a player - which, in the torrent of mergers and takeovers, means being a big player. Watch this cyberspace. </p> <p>The BBC has certainly been doing that, and the news from its briefings is euphoric as well as highly convenient. Put together the Corporation's existing online services, add many more around the world, make strategic liaisons - and you're talking amazing wealth. If revenues hit their estimated \u00a31.4 billion by 2006 (with the usual Internet premium added) the worth of the Corporation's commercial arm could turn Rupert Murdoch green. </p> <p>At the moment, all the commercial stuff contributes around 4 per cent of BBC revenue: shrimp statistics against the annual \u00a32bn-plus from the licence fee. But that balance is changing with bewildering rapidity. Who, Greg Dyke may shortly ask, needs a fat licence increase to feed our digital ambitions? The \u00a31.5bn of imposed 'savings' over five years may be easy pickings. </p> <p>Rosy scenarios to make almost everyone happy. The Beeb finds a crock of gold and becomes a true world force; the politicians don't have to keep on taking nasty licence fee decisions; the viewer gets more money spent on programmes and channels while paying (absolutely or relatively) less. Where's the catch? </p> <p>It is, of course, in what happens all around - to a competition out-gunned. BBC Worldwide, the aforementioned commercial arm, already has trouble on that count. When Gavyn Davies looked at Corporation funding last year, he found ITV, independent radio, the Advertising Association and many more queuing to complain about unfairness; and Davies wasn't unsympathetic. 'Very real issues arise when a public service broadcaster enters the commercial arena and, as usual, the devil is in the detail.' </p> <p>Thus far the BBC has sought to silence such devilry through an elaborate code of practice ensuring 'clear separation between publicly-funded and commercial activities', but the Net is a Hellfire club of complications. </p> <p>Take <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">BBC Online</a>, already Europe's most significant portal, boasting more than 100 million hits a month (half of them outside Britain). A service without advertising to you or me, sitting at home in the UK, because we're licence fee payers - but not necessarily so, as it's run out across the world in related sites such as <a href=\"http://www.bbcamerica.com/\" target=\"_new\">BBCAmerica</a> - and vestigially 'separated' from <a href=\"http://www.beeb.com\" target=\"_new\">Beeb.com</a>, Worldwide's existing commercial shop window. </p> <p>You can't put BBC Online down. It's a lush package of news and information. But then it should be. Even last year it cost \u00a323 million to run (11 times the cost of BBC Parliament) - which, give or take the odd bob, is the editorial cost of producing a national paper such as the Independent. The marketing is vast and constant, but cheap. Almost every TV and radio programme automatically cross-refers to the website. BBC branding naturally dominates. We pay for it. We can't, in the nicest sense, get away from it. </p> <p>For the user, though, this isn't like ordering a different cable channel. A single key stroke takes you from Online to Beeb.com; they're two peas in the same electronic pod. But the overwhelming reason for logging on to them is Online's commodious news service which, unlike that of every other competitor, real or potential, doesn't even have to think about making a profit because the licence fee covers all that. </p> <p>Newspapers don't have the luxury of throwing up their hands and retreating. They, too, are having to pour millions into the Net, putting their own news online and swimming in red ink as a result. </p> <p>There are sites that will reap big dividends. (The <a href=\"http://www.ft.com\" target=\"_new\">FT</a> pounds on).

      "bodyText": "It was another wonderful week on the Net. Free this, free that and even free promises of universal surfage from Tony Blair. Who cares about the fine print when everyone's scenting zillions? But maybe Fleet Street and the BBC should start to care: they'll be going to war soon over this uniquely rich greenfield site. The warning figures are there for the Beeb, buried in another of the reports they love to commission from McKinsey. Net usage in America is growing almost exponentially, and it's beginning to hurt TV viewing figures. Now such hurt is coming to a living room nearer home. You can't surf and cook couch potatoes at the same time. You have to have a huge stake in the new media, because it will be a huge part of your future. And, of course, top newspaper executives have identical research forebodings shivering the timbers on their office desks. Here the warnings are starker yet. Five or 10 years on, will there even be a market place for printed words on paper? Migration to the Net is not some optional extra: you neglect defensive action at your peril. You have to be a player - which, in the torrent of mergers and takeovers, means being a big player. Watch this cyberspace. The BBC has certainly been doing that, and the news from its briefings is euphoric as well as highly convenient. Put together the Corporation's existing online services, add many more around the world, make strategic liaisons - and you're talking amazing wealth. If revenues hit their estimated \u00a31.4 billion by 2006 (with the usual Internet premium added) the worth of the Corporation's commercial arm could turn Rupert Murdoch green. At the moment, all the commercial stuff contributes around 4 per cent of BBC revenue: shrimp statistics against the annual \u00a32bn-plus from the licence fee. But that balance is changing with bewildering rapidity. Who, Greg Dyke may shortly ask, needs a fat licence increase to feed our digital ambitions? The \u00a31.5bn of imposed 'savings' over five years may be easy pickings. Rosy scenarios to make almost everyone happy. The Beeb finds a crock of gold and becomes a true world force; the politicians don't have to keep on taking nasty licence fee decisions; the viewer gets more money spent on programmes and channels while paying (absolutely or relatively) less. Where's the catch? It is, of course, in what happens all around - to a competition out-gunned. BBC Worldwide, the aforementioned commercial arm, already has trouble on that count. When Gavyn Davies looked at Corporation funding last year, he found ITV, independent radio, the Advertising Association and many more queuing to complain about unfairness; and Davies wasn't unsympathetic. 'Very real issues arise when a public service broadcaster enters the commercial arena and, as usual, the devil is in the detail.' Thus far the BBC has sought to silence such devilry through an elaborate code of practice ensuring 'clear separation between publicly-funded and commercial activities', but the Net is a Hellfire club of complications. Take BBC Online, already Europe's most significant portal, boasting more than 100 million hits a month (half of them outside Britain). A service without advertising to you or me, sitting at home in the UK, because we're licence fee payers - but not necessarily so, as it's run out across the world in related sites such as BBCAmerica - and vestigially 'separated' from Beeb.com, Worldwide's existing commercial shop window. You can't put BBC Online down. It's a lush package of news and information. But then it should be. Even last year it cost \u00a323 million to run (11 times the cost of BBC Parliament) - which, give or take the odd bob, is the editorial cost of producing a national paper such as the Independent. The marketing is vast and constant, but cheap. Almost every TV and radio programme automatically cross-refers to the website. BBC branding naturally dominates. We pay for it. We can't, in the nicest sense, get away from it. For the user, though, this isn't like ordering a different cable channel. A single key stroke takes you from Online to Beeb.com; they're two peas in the same electronic pod. But the overwhelming reason for logging on to them is Online's commodious news service which, unlike that of every other competitor, real or potential, doesn't even have to think about making a profit because the licence fee covers all that. Newspapers don't have the luxury of throwing up their hands and retreating. They, too, are having to pour millions into the Net, putting their own news online and swimming in red ink as a result. There are sites that will reap big dividends. (The FT pounds on). There are sites that win prizes and may, in time, produce a good revenue stream (such as Guardian Unlimited , with 12 million hits a month). Yet the BBC already sits in the middle of the essential battlefield, replete and vastly strong. Like anything else as the Net balloon heads into the stratosphere, today's prediction may be tomorrow's small print apology. BBC Worldwide management isn't universally beloved by those who work with it. Post-tax profits of \u00a312m last year on a turnover of \u00a3420m wouldn't set any normal business world alight. But make no mistake: Mr Dyke's Beeb is parked right in the firing line - and newspapers, when they look around them, are bound to start shooting.",

We're both law graduates and of the same generation ... We consider the Prime Minister's visit very significant ... Our countries are natural partners and at critical periods in world history they always stood together'.</p> <p>Blair said it was 'a privilege' to be in St Petersburg and refuted suggestions that he was sending the wrong signal by meeting Putin only two weeks before Russia's presidential election and against the background of atrocities in Chechnya.</p> <p>'It is in the interests of the whole world that Russia is a successful and engaged nation,' said Blair. 'We've had a very good and full discussion ...

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday risked the wrath of human rights groups by giving Russian acting President Vladimir Putin, who has led a brutal military onslaught on Chechnya, his broad seal of approval. Putin, who has just announced his intention to impose direct presidential rule on Chechnya, robustly defended the policies which have reduced Grozny to rubble and made it plain that he had no intention of bowing to Western pressure to halt the onslaught. He surprised observers by asking for Western support to combat terrorism in his country, citing the British experience in Northern Ireland as an example his security forces could learn from. Britain has declined his request. Blair's visit and the cordial tone of his meetings with Putin, is being seen as a major coup for the Russian leader who will almost certainly be elected President later this month. When Blair and Putin emerged after two hours of talks in the Petrodvorets Palace, the Russian President appeared to make a significant concession to Western outrage over the slaughter in Chechnya. He claimed that Russia was ready to listen and 'make adjustments' and would consider whether to allow international observers from the Red Cross and other organisations into the war zone. But the British delegation warned afterwards that no new concrete concessions had emerged from the talks. While Blair told Putin that there should be 'objective' investigations of human rights violations in Chechnya and complained that Russia's response to Chechen secessionism was 'disproportionate', British officials appeared to accept much of Putin's argument. A Downing Street official said: 'There is a terrorist insurrection there on their [Russia's] territory.' Such a view of the Chechen conflict will delight the Russian leadership. The Blair visit was the first time a Western head of government has met Putin since he succeeded Boris Yeltsin. Putin, 47 to Blair's 46, made much of the things he said he had in common with the Prime Minister. Heading off with his wife Lyudmila to spend an evening at the opera with Blair and his wife, Cherie, Putin described the Prime Minister as 'a very pleasant and a very appropriate partner. We're both law graduates and of the same generation ... We consider the Prime Minister's visit very significant ... Our countries are natural partners and at critical periods in world history they always stood together'. Blair said it was 'a privilege' to be in St Petersburg and refuted suggestions that he was sending the wrong signal by meeting Putin only two weeks before Russia's presidential election and against the background of atrocities in Chechnya. 'It is in the interests of the whole world that Russia is a successful and engaged nation,' said Blair. 'We've had a very good and full discussion ... I want to say how much I have enjoyed that dialogue.' Putin signalled on Friday that he intended to impose direct presidential rule on Chechnya 'for a couple of years' after the election on 26 March and stressed that any political talks on Chechnya's future would not countenance secession.",

Flattered and distracted, in a world where everything else is changing, they become unwilling - or simply too busy - to change themselves. You see it in newspapers, in big companies, in politics. Only a very few, very good leaders have the deep self-confidence, the inner lack of vanity, to keep learning lessons.</p> <p>Whether Tony Blair is among them, we will find out soon. New Labour's spring crisis should provoke some long, intensely reflective walks round the grounds of Chequers. I say 'a crisis'. Perhaps that's overdoing it. Composed of Ken, weakening polling, devolutionary problems in Scotland and Wales, likely bad results in the local elections and the Ayr by-election, this is not enough yet to threaten Blair's chances of a second term. But if the story of this spring is ignored, it is enough to make that second term a miserable experience.</p> <p>Consider, first, the London comedy. Blair is against Livingstone because Ken will scare off the voters and horrify the middle classes. Ken, meanwhile, is currently scaring off the voters so effectively that he is the runaway favourite to become London's directly-elected mayor. As to the middle classes, he is scooping up every merchant banker with monogrammed shirts and half the gels who lunch at Peter Jones en route.</p> <p>And why is Ken so popular? Because he will make Tony cross. Tee hee. Ho, ho. Let's fart at the Emperor. That's about it. In terms of left-right politics, Ken's campaign seems to be a clinical, brightly-coloured, postmodern vacuity. Not only has he no party, he has no discernible leftist agenda, no labels. This is personality politics, as pure as they come, almost a caricature of Blairite strategy.</p> <p>Many commentators have pointed to the similarities between Blair's cross-party and over-party appeal in 1997 and the Livingstone appeal today. But the difference is this: Blair made it safe to vote for Ken. Without Blair's tight grip on Labour's national agenda - the same tight grip which produced the grotesque fixing of the London electoral college and gave Ken his chance to stand 'for democracy' - middle-ground voters would be far less ready to support Livingstone now. And, piling paradox on irony in a tottery tower, many of those who will elect Ken purely to offend Blair will happily vote Blair again next time.</p> <p>For the voters are ahead of Downing Street. Devolution makes it possible to balance different layers of authority, to hedge your bets, to heckle the Great. This is so in every mature, dispersed democracy; none of them are monocultures and they are the better for it. At some level, Blair knows that very well: defending devolution, he told the Edinburgh Parliament last week that 'you do not judge these changes in days or months or even a short space of years. You judge them in the broad sweep of history'.</p> <p>Wise words. New Labour promised a New Britain and it's getting one, with all the pain and mess that surrounds any birth. Blair himself is - I guess - learning along with everyone else. Has Rhodri Morgan in Cardiff been such a terrible embarrassment since he took over? Indeed, has anyone much noticed? And does Blair now think he was right to put such effort into blocking him in the first place? Of course not.</p> <p>So there is no question of New Labour trying to reverse devolution, despite Ken, Ayr, Morgan and the rest. The second term may take this a stage further: I gather that the great task of reviving Britain's cities and towns may be Number 10's 'big idea' for the next election. It is a noble idea and meets a rising mood in many towns and cities, from Liverpool, where the commission on the city's democratic future has come up with some fascinating and radical thoughts, to smaller towns across England, such as Brighton with its civic forum.</p> <p>Revival would require an end to the amateurism and weakened powers of today' s local authorities. But it would also force Downing Street to confront one of the root causes of its current embarrassments, its relationship with the Labour Party. For activists in many places other than London are asking: are we still wanted on voyage?</p> <p>There is no mystery about why the Labour activists were sidelined in the first place. Throughout Blair's formative years in politics they gave a good impression of loathing the British in general. It is hard to explain to people who weren't there at its rancorous Eighties worst just how awful things were - all I can say is that a lot of memories were brought back for me by John O'Farrell's brilliant memoir, Things Can Only Get Better , and the character who decided that smiling was right-wing and pretended to be miserable throughout the Eighties as a political statement.</p> <p>But that was then. And Ken the Restaurant Critic isn't going to bring it back. So the question is a real one: what would New Labour want to do with a mass movement, even if it had one? As the Livingstone campaign will demonstrate, activists are less important than ever when it comes to electioneering. Most of us get so much highly-coloured garbage through the front door that the impact of another leaflet, as compared to TV, radio and newspaper coverage, is negligible. 'Getting the vote out' matters a bit; but that is a once-in-four-years job. What about the rest of the time?</p> <p>Policy is made by professionals in London, behind closed doors; sold and attacked through the national media and debated on chat shows. A whole tradition of political participation, based around direct argument in school halls, trade union offices or front rooms, plus annual pilgrimages to seaside resorts to vote on policies, is dying away. People throughout the Labour Party feel badly hurt by this. They feel demeaned and ignored. They know there is a residual role left for the 'active supporter' as distinct from the activist - do the donkey-work, go along to Conference and clap at the right moment, or merely pay money and hold a card as a reminder to your wallet that you're on the winning side. But this is more like adult membership of the Tufty Club than politics: driven, intelligent people with a conscience want more than that.</p> <p>Part of the answer is given by Blair and Gordon Brown when they talk of voluntarism and the need for a stronger civic society. Whatever you think about New Labour, it is committed to public good works, to people getting off their sofas and doing something for their communities. It is anything but fatalistic. But the mechanism for political activism, the lever, has been oddly lacking. And here, I think, is where the revival of cities and towns comes in.</p> <p>For it simply cannot happen without local politics. Labour, like the others, was once rooted in local initiative. In the middle of the twentieth century, half of the great Labour figures had learned their radicalism and optimism on local councils. The glaringly obvious job for tomorrow's political activist is the restoration of confident, well-run and ambitious cities and towns. This is what links the party's past with its future. And this is the ground on which Blair can rebuild his relationship with the sane, community-minded and somewhat disappointed people who make up the majority of Labour's local army.</p> <p>But it means - it must mean - that Labour is not identical everywhere. As Blair has discovered over the past few weeks, you cannot successfully dictate your party choices from the centre in a system tailored to local choice. You end up fixing, arm-twisting and bullying _ and then you fail anyway. New Blair is going to have to live the pluralism Old Blair has created. He's going to have to watch, and approve, many Labour people - and Libs - and Tories - exercising power across the country and doing things he wouldn't have done. He's going to have to realise that he can't have an exclusive relationship with the British people; we are not monogamous. Can he change himself enough? I hope so.</p> <p>Throughout my lifetime we have been local people run by a decayed imperial machine. And at long last that is breaking up and giving way to something that is beginning to look suspiciously like a democracy. And whose achievement is that? Not Ken's.</p>",

And does Blair now think he was right to put such effort into blocking him in the first place? Of course not. So there is no question of New Labour trying to reverse devolution, despite Ken, Ayr, Morgan and the rest. The second term may take this a stage further: I gather that the great task of reviving Britain's cities and towns may be Number 10's 'big idea' for the next election. It is a noble idea and meets a rising mood in many towns and cities, from Liverpool, where the commission on the city's democratic future has come up with some fascinating and radical thoughts, to smaller towns across England, such as Brighton with its civic forum. Revival would require an end to the amateurism and weakened powers of today' s local authorities. But it would also force Downing Street to confront one of the root causes of its current embarrassments, its relationship with the Labour Party. For activists in many places other than London are asking: are we still wanted on voyage? There is no mystery about why the Labour activists were sidelined in the first place. Throughout Blair's formative years in politics they gave a good impression of loathing the British in general. It is hard to explain to people who weren't there at its rancorous Eighties worst just how awful things were - all I can say is that a lot of memories were brought back for me by John O'Farrell's brilliant memoir, Things Can Only Get Better , and the character who decided that smiling was right-wing and pretended to be miserable throughout the Eighties as a political statement. But that was then. And Ken the Restaurant Critic isn't going to bring it back. So the question is a real one: what would New Labour want to do with a mass movement, even if it had one? As the Livingstone campaign will demonstrate, activists are less important than ever when it comes to electioneering. Most of us get so much highly-coloured garbage through the front door that the impact of another leaflet, as compared to TV, radio and newspaper coverage, is negligible. 'Getting the vote out' matters a bit; but that is a once-in-four-years job. What about the rest of the time? Policy is made by professionals in London, behind closed doors; sold and attacked through the national media and debated on chat shows. A whole tradition of political participation, based around direct argument in school halls, trade union offices or front rooms, plus annual pilgrimages to seaside resorts to vote on policies, is dying away. People throughout the Labour Party feel badly hurt by this. They feel demeaned and ignored. They know there is a residual role left for the 'active supporter' as distinct from the activist - do the donkey-work, go along to Conference and clap at the right moment, or merely pay money and hold a card as a reminder to your wallet that you're on the winning side. But this is more like adult membership of the Tufty Club than politics: driven, intelligent people with a conscience want more than that. Part of the answer is given by Blair and Gordon Brown when they talk of voluntarism and the need for a stronger civic society. Whatever you think about New Labour, it is committed to public good works, to people getting off their sofas and doing something for their communities. It is anything but fatalistic. But the mechanism for political activism, the lever, has been oddly lacking. And here, I think, is where the revival of cities and towns comes in. For it simply cannot happen without local politics. Labour, like the others, was once rooted in local initiative. In the middle of the twentieth century, half of the great Labour figures had learned their radicalism and optimism on local councils. The glaringly obvious job for tomorrow's political activist is the restoration of confident, well-run and ambitious cities and towns. This is what links the party's past with its future. And this is the ground on which Blair can rebuild his relationship with the sane, community-minded and somewhat disappointed people who make up the majority of Labour's local army. But it means - it must mean - that Labour is not identical everywhere. As Blair has discovered over the past few weeks, you cannot successfully dictate your party choices from the centre in a system tailored to local choice. You end up fixing, arm-twisting and bullying _ and then you fail anyway. New Blair is going to have to live the pluralism Old Blair has created. He's going to have to watch, and approve, many Labour people - and Libs - and Tories - exercising power across the country and doing things he wouldn't have done. He's going to have to realise that he can't have an exclusive relationship with the British people; we are not monogamous. Can he change himself enough? I hope so. Throughout my lifetime we have been local people run by a decayed imperial machine. And at long last that is breaking up and giving way to something that is beginning to look suspiciously like a democracy. And whose achievement is that? Not Ken's.",

A decade after that appalling event, we, who were his colleagues, know all too well why Farzad took the chance he did in Baghdad to go in search of a story that was to lead to his arrest with a British nurse, Daphne Parish, his drugged confession, a spurious trial on spying charges and his eventual hanging.</p> <p>He was a journalist, eager, over-eager perhaps (if over-enthusiasm can ever be thought a failing in a reporter), to get the facts behind an explosion in an Iraqi weapons plant that had aroused international interest. In doing so he slipped from the hands of his 'civilised' Iraqi Foreign Ministry minders into the clutches of the internal security forces that kept Saddam in power then and still do today, despite all the predictions of his imminent downfall and a policy of sanctions that have served only to starve his people and increase his own authority.</p> <p>Not that Farzad would have wanted the war or the sanctions. Despite being an Iranian, he liked the Iraqis, and particularly some of the Iraqi embassy staff in London. Which is one reason why the embassy invited him as a guest of the Baghdad government on several trips to Iraq before that last fateful invitation in September 1989. He was a man difficult to refuse anything, most especially when it concerned a story. His enthusiasm was so complete, his desire to like, and be liked, so endearing that the initial instinct of saying no to him all too easily slipped to yes.</p> <p>He came to The Observer - after a chequered (as we were later to find out) student life in Luton - as a freelance helping on stories about immigrants and the rising force of Middle East protest groups in London. He continued providing information and stories on the Iran-Iraq war, then largely ignored by a press.</p> <p>When the war finished, Farzad, like Saddam himself, turned his attention to the dictator's policy inside Iraq, and in doing so became the victim of the tyranny he had chosen to examine. It was a terrible irony that his last trip was organised to cover new elections among a Kurdish community that Saddam was gassing to death. It was the more painful that the first public protest The Observer made about Farzad's arrest was at a meeting organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and backed by the British Foreign Office, to proclaim Iraq's 'move to democracy'.</p> <p>And therein lies the simple lesson of Farzad's brutal murder if we are ever to understand the nature of authoritarian rule and to challenge it with any kind of 'ethical' foreign policy. Regimes such as Saddam Hussein's - and it is valid as much for today's China, Syria, Burma, and potentially Russia and some of the Caucasian states as it is for Iraq - work through multiple levels. The face they present to the outside world - the face they present to foreign diplomats, the international press and even the business and other communities - is one of accommodation and pragmatism. If you never go beyond that level there is no reason to feel there is anything else. Actual power, however, is exercised through a network of security forces held severally, and competitively, at the centre. These are more than just an instrument of oppression. The generals and the agents are held by favours and obligations, as well as fear.</p> <p>The trouble with any policy of punishment through isolation is that you merely tighten the control of the regime. The fewer the goods, the more Saddam can use such as there are to reward his acolytes - and equally to punish his enemies, or even friends, by depriving them. The only way you can bring down, or help undermine, such regimes, is opening up their countries as much as possible to ideas and trade and make available goods and opportunities to those who would otherwise be dependent on the regime to get them. To do that you have to support the free flow of ideas, journalistic inquiry included.</p> <p>In the end Farzad was lucky in that the British embassy did support him (partly because he was arrested with a British-born nurse) and had the comfort of visits from a British Consul of exceptional individual humanity. He (and Britain as it turned out) was less lucky in a British ambassador and a Foreign Office that looked to his intrusion as an unnecessary nuisance, who saw the future as getting on better with Saddam and controlling him through persuasion rather than a realistic assessment of his ambitions and a determined pursuit of our own ideals.</p> <p>It is the same argument being used this weekend as Tony Blair rushes to be the first head of state to kiss the cheek of the President-to-be Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. We have followed the same line in China, even to the extent of suppressing in Britain the very right of democratic protest - the very right we are supposed to be promoting abroad. Far from helping to speed change abroad it will set it back by enabling the outer face of pragmatism to disguise the inner core of internal suppression, the core it took Farzad's death to help expose in Iraq.</p> <p>And yet, looking back, what remains the most powerful of all feelings is not anger, which his colleagues feel, responsibility, which I feel myself, or even grief, which all who knew him experienced, but an overwhelming sense of fondness for the man and the journalist. There he'd be, clutching an obscure item from the Middle East press. 'I can find out more about this,' he would say, as one's eyes rolled up at the thought of one's foreign correspondents demanding to know what he was doing on their patch and staff reporters complaining that their stories were being spiked for a freelancer. 'I know someone who will help me on this,' he'd persist. 'It's a good story, I know it.' He did and it was.</p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Hamilton was deputy editor of The Observer from 1989-1993.

      "bodyText": "Ten years after the brutal execution in Baghdad of Observer journalist Farzad Bazoft, we know enough about Saddam Hussein to be entirely unsurprised that he could have murdered a British reporter in the face of every international objection. A decade after that appalling event, we, who were his colleagues, know all too well why Farzad took the chance he did in Baghdad to go in search of a story that was to lead to his arrest with a British nurse, Daphne Parish, his drugged confession, a spurious trial on spying charges and his eventual hanging. He was a journalist, eager, over-eager perhaps (if over-enthusiasm can ever be thought a failing in a reporter), to get the facts behind an explosion in an Iraqi weapons plant that had aroused international interest. In doing so he slipped from the hands of his 'civilised' Iraqi Foreign Ministry minders into the clutches of the internal security forces that kept Saddam in power then and still do today, despite all the predictions of his imminent downfall and a policy of sanctions that have served only to starve his people and increase his own authority. Not that Farzad would have wanted the war or the sanctions. Despite being an Iranian, he liked the Iraqis, and particularly some of the Iraqi embassy staff in London. Which is one reason why the embassy invited him as a guest of the Baghdad government on several trips to Iraq before that last fateful invitation in September 1989. He was a man difficult to refuse anything, most especially when it concerned a story. His enthusiasm was so complete, his desire to like, and be liked, so endearing that the initial instinct of saying no to him all too easily slipped to yes. He came to The Observer - after a chequered (as we were later to find out) student life in Luton - as a freelance helping on stories about immigrants and the rising force of Middle East protest groups in London. He continued providing information and stories on the Iran-Iraq war, then largely ignored by a press. When the war finished, Farzad, like Saddam himself, turned his attention to the dictator's policy inside Iraq, and in doing so became the victim of the tyranny he had chosen to examine. It was a terrible irony that his last trip was organised to cover new elections among a Kurdish community that Saddam was gassing to death. It was the more painful that the first public protest The Observer made about Farzad's arrest was at a meeting organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and backed by the British Foreign Office, to proclaim Iraq's 'move to democracy'. And therein lies the simple lesson of Farzad's brutal murder if we are ever to understand the nature of authoritarian rule and to challenge it with any kind of 'ethical' foreign policy. Regimes such as Saddam Hussein's - and it is valid as much for today's China, Syria, Burma, and potentially Russia and some of the Caucasian states as it is for Iraq - work through multiple levels. The face they present to the outside world - the face they present to foreign diplomats, the international press and even the business and other communities - is one of accommodation and pragmatism. If you never go beyond that level there is no reason to feel there is anything else. Actual power, however, is exercised through a network of security forces held severally, and competitively, at the centre. These are more than just an instrument of oppression. The generals and the agents are held by favours and obligations, as well as fear. The trouble with any policy of punishment through isolation is that you merely tighten the control of the regime. The fewer the goods, the more Saddam can use such as there are to reward his acolytes - and equally to punish his enemies, or even friends, by depriving them. The only way you can bring down, or help undermine, such regimes, is opening up their countries as much as possible to ideas and trade and make available goods and opportunities to those who would otherwise be dependent on the regime to get them. To do that you have to support the free flow of ideas, journalistic inquiry included. In the end Farzad was lucky in that the British embassy did support him (partly because he was arrested with a British-born nurse) and had the comfort of visits from a British Consul of exceptional individual humanity. He (and Britain as it turned out) was less lucky in a British ambassador and a Foreign Office that looked to his intrusion as an unnecessary nuisance, who saw the future as getting on better with Saddam and controlling him through persuasion rather than a realistic assessment of his ambitions and a determined pursuit of our own ideals. It is the same argument being used this weekend as Tony Blair rushes to be the first head of state to kiss the cheek of the President-to-be Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. We have followed the same line in China, even to the extent of suppressing in Britain the very right of democratic protest - the very right we are supposed to be promoting abroad. Far from helping to speed change abroad it will set it back by enabling the outer face of pragmatism to disguise the inner core of internal suppression, the core it took Farzad's death to help expose in Iraq. And yet, looking back, what remains the most powerful of all feelings is not anger, which his colleagues feel, responsibility, which I feel myself, or even grief, which all who knew him experienced, but an overwhelming sense of fondness for the man and the journalist. There he'd be, clutching an obscure item from the Middle East press. 'I can find out more about this,' he would say, as one's eyes rolled up at the thought of one's foreign correspondents demanding to know what he was doing on their patch and staff reporters complaining that their stories were being spiked for a freelancer. 'I know someone who will help me on this,' he'd persist. 'It's a good story, I know it.' He did and it was. \u0095 Adrian Hamilton was deputy editor of The Observer from 1989-1993.

Ever since it has been a case of the the mighty Millbank machine rushing to catch up with what Downing Street derisively calls 'poor unspun Ken'.</p> <p>Livingstone's challenge has unleashed a latent anti-establishment, anti-politics mood in metropolitan London and raised fears that New Labour is losing touch with its own party and heartland support. A runaway Livingstone victory, heralded by a Guardian poll last week, would be symbolic of a deep malaise at the heart of the Government. One depressed Labour official said: 'Cutting back a 55-point lead in six weeks seems a bit steep - 45 points maybe, but this ...'</p> <p>The chances of such a turn-around are not helped by continuing tensions between Millbank and the Dobson camp. Dobson has made little effort to disguise his anger with Millbank and insists he could have won the party ballot, even if the vote had been confined to London party members.</p> <p>Since then he has been displaying his independence, in matters of image as well as policy: he has apparently refused blandishments from party image consultants to shave off his beard. He has also told the Treasury he thinks Gordon Brown is wrong not to allow the Mayor to borrow against the income expected from congestion charging to improve bus services. He has refused requests from party officials to put the plan for a public-private partnership to a group of independent experts when in office, an issue on which he differs from the official party line.</p> <p>Dobson's aides have decided he has to go hard on policy and play up the importance of the mayoralty. They see this as the only way of persuading Liberal Democrats and Conservatives not to risk their second preference votes on Livingstone. 'We have got to make Liberals and Tories think this election and this job matters and not to throw their vote away on Ken.'</p> <p>Party officials know they have a massive damage repair job to undertake with their own activists.

Further similar bloodletting sessions are planned in the hope that angry activists will agree to knock on doors for Dobson, once one of the most popular figures in the London party.</p> <p>Some in Millbank have even privately raised the question of whether its image is so bad they should leave the building, or change its name. Once feted as an effective election-winning machine, the Millbank brand is now synonymous with control freaks and ruthlessness.</p> <p>Party officials are now agonising over the level of discipline they will impose on party members who back Livingstone. Respected party figures such as Ian McCartney and London party chairman Jim Fitzpatrick had opposed banning Livingstone from standing for the party nomination on the ground that it would lead to a mass exodus from the party. Both now want to ensure the party emerges from these elections intact, if bruised. They are cautioning against a witch-hunt against Labour members supporting Livingstone.</p> <p>Signing Livingstone's nomination papers or acting as his agent would mean automatic expulsion, but open support, such as putting up one of his posters or raising cash for his campaign, could also lead to disciplinary action. One branch party chairman from south London said: 'The people who really believe in Ken, who are in the Labour Party not outside it, have now been disenfranchised. They can either get themselves kicked out of the party and end their political lives or they can send him wads of cash in brown envelopes and vote for him in the secrecy of the polling booth and no one will ever know.'</p> <p>Millbank, desperate to get the media's attention on to Dobson's policies, cannot afford more time taken up with the agenda dominated by party wrangling. 'We have got to get Livingstone nailed on policy. It is our only hope,' saId one official.</p> <p>But Downing Street seems to be quietly preparing for defeat. Officials openly acknowledge that there will be a Livingstone effect, not only in the elections for seats for the Greater London Assembly on 6 May, but also in the nationwide local elections on the same date.</p> <p>Labour has even privately admitted that veteran left-wing journalist Paul Foot is likely to be elected to the new GLA in the Livingstone backwash. It will be the first time a Trotskyist has been elected to a public body since Tommy Sheridan won a seat in the Scottish Assembly last year. The polls even suggest that Darren Johnson, 33-year-old leader of the Green Party, is assured a seat in the new Assembly.</p> <p>In the wider local elections across the country, Labour is also bracing itself for horrible headlines in its true heart lands. It is defending over 1,550 of the 3,337 seats last contested in 1996, a high water mark for Blair as the public prepared to throw John Major out in a landslide the following year. One Cabinet Minister said: 'It is frightening. We are going to take a terrible beating.'</p> <p>The Tories will make 200 gains, even if they just equal their 34 per cent share of the vote achieved in last year's round of elections. If they make over 400 gains, they will be doing well enough to claim they are on course for victory in a general election.</p> <p>In local government by-elections since Christmas there are already signs Labour is falling back in the wake of the health service crisis and now the splits over Livingstone. Labour's share of the vote went up in only two of the 30 council by-elections contested.</p> <p>Many Cabinet Ministers admit to frustration in the heartland seats, despite the plethora of initiatives, action zones and social exclusion policies targeted at the poor. It is no longer heresy for Cabinet Ministers such as Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to admit openly, as he will today to the Scottish conference, that the Government's message is not getting through to its core support. Education Secretary David Blunkett admits there 'are very, very deep seated problems in disadvantaged areas'.</p> <p>Some Ministers, such as Cook's deputy in the Foreign Office, Peter Hain, are even willing to warn in public that the next election hangs in the balance if the Government does not concentrate on getting its message across.</p> <p>His argument follows closely the analysis revealed last week from Greg Cook, the party's own pollster. Labour's 171-seat majority might be threatened if Labour's vote stayed at home and Hague's euro-sceptic platform galvanised his core supporters, taking the Conservative vote share into the mid-30s.</p> <p>Hain, who previously warned of disenchantment in the heartlands following the Welsh Assembly elections, told The Observer : 'Labour's official research showing up to one in five Labour supporters may stay at home at the next general election bears out exactly my own feel for the situation, not just in a heartland constituency like Neath - where certainly that is the mood - but generally across the country among our traditional supporters.</p> <p>'The problem is not just confined to our heartland seats. If 10,000 came off my majority in Neath, it could be argued that Labour would be re-elected comfortably. But that misses the key point. There is a core vote - a traditional Labour support - in every constituency in the land. It might be only a few hundred in a marginal seat in the South-East, but we need that core vote to turn out to win those marginal seats. We cannot just rely on the New Labour vote which Tony Blair has so brilliantly swung behind the party. So this is an issue that does not just affect traditional areas, it affects the whole country.</p> <p>'I think what we need to do is focus laser-like on getting our message across and make it a real priority. It is amazing to me how few people know that we have brought in the minimum wage or the working families tax credit or the other measures driven through by the Chancellor to benefit the poorest in society. It's as if it has been done, but no one knows about it. We need to start preaching the gospel.</p> <p>'We have also got to start maximising our opportunities. For example, in the case of the minimum wage we managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. A great message to our traditional supporters that the minimum wage is going up to over \u00a34 an hour turns into a row within government over whether 10p extra is enough or not. We just cannot keep doing that.</p> <p>'Some people think there is a contradiction in appealing to the Mirror and the Daily Mail vote. I have never said that. We have to appeal to Middle Britain and the Daily Mail , but we seem to have lost the knack of communicating with the Mirror readership and it is time we rediscovered it.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain's new 'heart tsar' is to launch a global recruitment drive for heart surgeons in a bid to improve Britain's appalling track record in treating heart disease. </p> <p>Dr Roger Boyle, appointed last week as National Heart Director, wants to start immediately recruiting doctors from countries such as the US and India as the quickest way to tackle the huge backlog of operations. </p> <p>Patients with heart disease are having to wait up to 18 months for an operation, and many die waiting. Britain has nearly the highest rate of heart disease of any developed country, but has one of the lowest number of heart surgeons, and performs around half as many operations as the European average. </p> <p>Last week Health Secretary Alan Milburn pledged to cut the maximum waiting time to three months over a 10-year period as part of a range of proposals aimed at cutting deaths from heart disease by 40 per cent by 2010. </p> <p>The Government allocated \u00a350 million to do an extra 3,000 operations, but in his first interview since his appointment, Boyle told The Observer that doing any more would be difficult because 'we do not have the staff to undertake the work'. </p> <p>Britain has only 170 heart surgeons, and although there are now 80 in training, it will take six years for them to qualify.

      "bodyText": "Britain's new 'heart tsar' is to launch a global recruitment drive for heart surgeons in a bid to improve Britain's appalling track record in treating heart disease. Dr Roger Boyle, appointed last week as National Heart Director, wants to start immediately recruiting doctors from countries such as the US and India as the quickest way to tackle the huge backlog of operations. Patients with heart disease are having to wait up to 18 months for an operation, and many die waiting. Britain has nearly the highest rate of heart disease of any developed country, but has one of the lowest number of heart surgeons, and performs around half as many operations as the European average. Last week Health Secretary Alan Milburn pledged to cut the maximum waiting time to three months over a 10-year period as part of a range of proposals aimed at cutting deaths from heart disease by 40 per cent by 2010. The Government allocated \u00a350 million to do an extra 3,000 operations, but in his first interview since his appointment, Boyle told The Observer that doing any more would be difficult because 'we do not have the staff to undertake the work'. Britain has only 170 heart surgeons, and although there are now 80 in training, it will take six years for them to qualify. As well as placing adverts, he will next week ask heart surgeons to approach their contacts overseas. He wants to recruit an extra 30 consultants, each of whom could perform 200 operations a year. Other plans to cut waiting times include abandoning the taboo about private hospitals, and paying them to do NHS heart operations for the first time. Boyle reckons that they have the capacity to do another 250 operations a month. 'The Prime Minister says he has no ideological objection to it,' said Boyle. But he admitted: 'It is a minefield.' Despite these plans, Boyle confessed that waiting times are likely to get longer before they get shorter. The package of measures announced last week is aimed at identifying everyone with heart disease, and making sure they receive appropriate treatment. 'Maximum waiting times could get worse rather than better in the short term, because if you concentrate more on identifying patients with coronary disease we're obviously going to uncover more patients who end up going down a surgical route,' said Boyle. Transported from a hospital in York, to the Department of Health offices in Whitehall, Boyle knows first hand the pressures that shortage of resources puts on doctors and patients. 'Dealing with the patient who is on a chronic wait is distressing, but it's nowhere near as distressing as the difficulty in transferring an acutely ill patient, where you know you haven't got weeks or months, but hours,' he said. A few months ago, he had a patient who had had 25 cardiac arrests and needed immediate surgery, ventilation, and an intensive-care bed. 'In the day in question we only found one bed available, which was in Oxford, and there's no way he would have survived to get that far,' he said. 'Somehow we coped.' Boyle will also be responsible for improving Britain's track record in preventing heart disease, not treating it only when it has occurred.

      "body": "<p>Conservative members of Parliament yesterday demanded an investigation into whether Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, should have declared hospitality provided to his nanny and her family by Geoffrey Robinson, the disgraced former Paymaster- General.</p> <p>The Blairs sent nanny Rosalind Mark as well as her mother and brother on a holiday to the south of France to thank them for helping with their move into Downing Street after Labour's election victory in 1997.</p> <p>Although Cherie Blair, the Prime Minister's wife, paid for first-class flights for the trio, Robinson is believed to have allowed them to stay in his luxury apartment in Cannes for nothing. At market rates, the trip would be worth several thousand pounds.</p> <p>David Heathcoat-Amory, Conservative MP for Wells, said that he would be complaining to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the Blairs' failure to disclose Robinson's hospitality as a 'benefit in kind'.</p> <p>'There comes a point where this becomes a pretty unhealthy relationship,' Heathcoat-Amory said. 'Given all this Government's waffle about openness and accountability, you have to ask why this wasn't registered.'</p> <p>Usually only business interests have to be declared in the Register of Members' Interests. In this case, Conservative MPs say, there are concerns following Robinson's departure from office and the collapse of his company, Transtec, with substantial debts. The Tories claim the Prime Minister would have considerable influence over the investigation into Robinson's affairs.</p> <p>Yesterday Number 10 said that 'any complaint about any trips will be dealt with in answer to questions from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards'.</p> <p>The Blairs have taken advantage of the hospitality of Robinson, MP for Coventry North-West, on a number of occasions. They stayed at his villa in northern Italy during summer breaks in 1996 and 1997. Although neither trip was listed in the Register of Members' Interests, complaints by Conservative MPs were rejected. Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and members of his staff have also spent time in the Cannes apartment.</p> <p>The 'Nannygate' affair broke last week when a Sunday newspaper published extracts from a 180,000-word memoir written by Mark detailing her life with the Blairs. Although considered not sufficiently 'explosive' by publishers, her revelations about life in Islington and then in Number 10 - tentatively titled 'The Downing Street Tears' - provoked an injunction ordering the Mail on Sunday to retrieve and pulp early editions. The Blairs sued Mark, her literary agent and the newspaper for damages.</p> <p>On Friday, the Blair family and Mark settled their differences at the doors of the High Court in London. In return for legal proceedings against her being dropped, Mark agreed to hand over all copies of her manuscript and to keep private any information about domestic life with the Blairs.

      "bodyText": "Conservative members of Parliament yesterday demanded an investigation into whether Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, should have declared hospitality provided to his nanny and her family by Geoffrey Robinson, the disgraced former Paymaster- General. The Blairs sent nanny Rosalind Mark as well as her mother and brother on a holiday to the south of France to thank them for helping with their move into Downing Street after Labour's election victory in 1997. Although Cherie Blair, the Prime Minister's wife, paid for first-class flights for the trio, Robinson is believed to have allowed them to stay in his luxury apartment in Cannes for nothing. At market rates, the trip would be worth several thousand pounds. David Heathcoat-Amory, Conservative MP for Wells, said that he would be complaining to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the Blairs' failure to disclose Robinson's hospitality as a 'benefit in kind'. 'There comes a point where this becomes a pretty unhealthy relationship,' Heathcoat-Amory said. 'Given all this Government's waffle about openness and accountability, you have to ask why this wasn't registered.' Usually only business interests have to be declared in the Register of Members' Interests. In this case, Conservative MPs say, there are concerns following Robinson's departure from office and the collapse of his company, Transtec, with substantial debts. The Tories claim the Prime Minister would have considerable influence over the investigation into Robinson's affairs. Yesterday Number 10 said that 'any complaint about any trips will be dealt with in answer to questions from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards'. The Blairs have taken advantage of the hospitality of Robinson, MP for Coventry North-West, on a number of occasions. They stayed at his villa in northern Italy during summer breaks in 1996 and 1997. Although neither trip was listed in the Register of Members' Interests, complaints by Conservative MPs were rejected. Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and members of his staff have also spent time in the Cannes apartment. The 'Nannygate' affair broke last week when a Sunday newspaper published extracts from a 180,000-word memoir written by Mark detailing her life with the Blairs. Although considered not sufficiently 'explosive' by publishers, her revelations about life in Islington and then in Number 10 - tentatively titled 'The Downing Street Tears' - provoked an injunction ordering the Mail on Sunday to retrieve and pulp early editions. The Blairs sued Mark, her literary agent and the newspaper for damages. On Friday, the Blair family and Mark settled their differences at the doors of the High Court in London. In return for legal proceedings against her being dropped, Mark agreed to hand over all copies of her manuscript and to keep private any information about domestic life with the Blairs. Lawyers for Mark said she was relieved the Blairs were no longer suing her. However, proceedings are still continuing against the Mail on Sunday and Jonathan Harris, Mark's literary agent. Harris has denied passing the manuscript to the newspaper, which is contesting the injunction against publishing the nanny's material. Labour Party spin-doctors have kept a tight grip on the affair. That control broke down on Tuesday when a reporter managed to gain access to the Mark family and was told by the nanny's mother about their anger at the way they felt they had been treated by the Blairs and Number 10. jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

She changed nappies so irregularly they hung heavy down her children's legs with the weight of their contents. When the nappies leaked, as inevitably they would, she left their legs wet until they became red and sore. Their hair became infested with lice and their feet turned hard and calloused because they had so rarely known shoes.</p> <p>At night, in the darkest hours, the babies were left crying out in hunger because their parents could not be bothered to get out of bed. And when they were fed it was with blended roast dinners and stews, weeks before they were ready even to begin weaning. Hospital appointments to monitor what eventually became life-threatening weight loss in some of the children were never kept and health visitors who tried to intervene were threatened and abused.</p> <p>Last week at Lewes Crown Court the mother of seven from Brighton who, along with her common-law husband, was responsible for this litany of abuse was found guilty of cruelty and neglect. All the police officers, medical experts and social workers involved in the case describe it as among the worst they have ever come across. The husband, already in prison for raping a relativewhen he was a teenager, pleaded guilty at the start of the trial. They will both be sentenced for these offences on 20 March.</p> <p>Those of us who sat through even a portion of the horrendous evidence could take little satisfaction from the guilty verdict. What many of us in the courtroom knew - and the jury did not know - was that the two defendants, who escape being named under injunctions designed to protect the identity of their children, who are now in care, had stood trial together at this court once before. Last July they were both charged with the murders of three children, two of their sons and a nephew. The first died in April 1994, the second and third in March 1997, just 19 days apart. All three died at home when there were no other adults present.</p> <p>At first each was judged a cot death, but after the third a series of leading paediatric pathologists called in by the police found all of them had died by smothering. The couple were arrested and their surviving children placed with foster parents. In police interviews the mother blamed the husband. He said nothing. In court, however, the judge, Mr Justice Moses, directed the jury to acquit.</p> <p>The mother's statements were purely self-serving, he said. What's more, he went on, 'The Crown cannot prove which of the two defendants smothered one or more of these children.' As it was therefore impossible to be certain who was responsible for the killings, or if they acted together, both had to be freed. Children who had been failed first by their parents and then by social services were failed again, this time by the justice system.</p> <p>Now senior police officers are calling for a change in the law. 'There needs to be some way of dealing with joint enterprise,' said Paul Whitehouse, Chief Constable of Sussex, this week. 'We have three people in a room. Two adults come out alive and the child is dead. How can it be right that you cannot convict either of them if they stay silent or blame each other?'</p> <p>Detective Inspector Malcolm Bacon, the chief investigating officer in the case, agrees: 'When the judge at the murder trial made his judgment I think the whole court was flabbergasted,' he said. 'I think there was sufficient evidence that should have been put before the jury.'</p> <p>Some involved with this case have made comparisons with the Fred and Rose West case in Gloucester: a family on the tattered fringes of urban society, abusing their children unhindered by the law. But that is to diminish it. All caring parents are caring in the same ways. They know how to offer love and comfort, how to minister to an infant's needs. All abusive parents are uniquely so. These two, whom we can refer to only as Ms X and Mr Y, took neglect of children to new lows.</p> <p>Both came from deprived backgrounds and had themselves spent periods in care as children. Together, from 1992 to 1998, they would have seven children, the last was born after they were arrested, and was taken into care at birth.</p> <p>Concern for the children would emerge soon after birth as each in turn appeared underfed and was clearly failing to thrive. Becky Chalker, a health visitor with Southdown Health Trust in Brighton, spent five years trying to get them to improve conditions which she described to the court as 'absolutely dreadful'. She recalled kneeling down on the floor to examine a urine- soaked child and finding the carpet soaking wet. There were overflowing ashtrays and full cat-litter trays in reach of the children.</p> <p>Displays of affection were so rare that Chalker noted them when they occurred. 'Toys were non-existent apart from a few soft ones,' she told the court. 'There was nothing appropriate for children who were developing and exploring.' She described one little boy as being fixed in a state of 'frozen watchfulness' by his treatment.</p> <p>In the summer of 1993 their second child, a boy, suffered what would was described to the jury in the cruelty and neglect case as 'an acute life-threatening event', an ambiguous phrase which could as easily describe a car crash as an assault. Starved of oxygen, he suffered brain damage, leaving him blind, deaf and unable to swallow. Despite concerns over the family's living conditions he was allowed to return home from hospital with his parents. There he lay on a beanbag, face turned to the wall, to be fed through a nasal gastric tube.</p> <p>In April 1994 the boy died. After their arrest, Ms X blamed her husband for the initial brain damage. That day their son had been crying and she had asked her husband to deal with him. He went into the room and the crying stopped. She said she passed her husband coming out of the room. 'My son had a pillow over his face,' she told police. 'My husband told me he would not stop crying and that he deserved all he got.'</p> <p>In 1995 police raided the flat, looking for stolen property. The father, their prime suspect, was in the lounge with friends. 'The adults were sat round the sides of the room, all wearing coats. It was very cold in there,' Detective Sergeant Amanda Hinchcliffe told the court. 'There was a baby lying on the floor in the middle of the room wearing just his nappy. He appeared very cold and was blue. Flies were landing on him.'</p> <p>The raid led to a visit by the Child Protection Unit who found similar conditions: a baby was asleep in a cot without a mattress, flies buzzing about it, faeces smeared on its stomach.</p> <p>The children - an ever-growing number because Ms X went from one pregnancy to the next - were put on the Child Protection Register and the parents were given 24 hours to clean up the flat, which they did. In a police interview Ms X admitted the state of the flat was 'not very clever' but that if it meant holding on to her children, she'd keep it clean. A file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service but they ruled there was insufficient evidence to proceed with charges of cruelty and neglect.</p> <p>The couple had got away with it, for now.</p> <p>The situation would repeat itself time and again throughout 230 visits by health and social work professionals, many of whom were subject to violent threats and abuse from Mr Y. The couple would do just enough to stop social services removing the children. The 1989 Children Act, passed in the wake of perceived over-zealousness by social workers in the Cleveland child abuse case of 1987, places emphasis on keeping families together rather than taking children into care. The social services felt they had to abide by its principles.</p> <p>What emerges from the police interviews from these periods and later is that Ms Y understood what it took to care for a child: she knew about the need to wash clothes and to keep sufficient food in the house. She understood the language of caring. They 'tried to be' a good mum and dad, she said. 'Read 'em stories. I done everything.' But her everything was very little.</p> <p>The deaths of their five-week-old nephew, followed by that of their six-week-old son 19 days apart in March 1997, were both ruled by a local pathologist to be by natural causes. However in April 1997 the Brighton coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley attended a lecture by paediatric pathologist Professor Mike Green, then of Sheffield University, on sudden unexplained infant deaths and when to be suspicious.</p> <p>Green has regularly been criticised by British Cot Death support groups who argue that he overstates the number of sudden infant deaths which are actually homicides. In an article last year in the British Medical Journal , Green said that up to 40 per cent of such deaths may be as a result of adult intervention. The Foun dation for the Study of Infant Deaths relies on a Department of Health inquiry figure of 6 per cent. Nevertheless Green's advice to 'think dirty' rang bells with the coroner. Green was asked to study all the reports surrounding the case.</p> <p>'If Miss Hamilton-Deeley hadn't attended my lecture it's possible I suppose that this couple could have continued for longer,' Green says now. 'The whole thing was just not right. I had little doubt that all three of these children had been smothered.'</p> <p>Working with paediatric pathologists Sir Roy Meadow at Leeds and Professor Jeremy Berry at Bristol, the police charged the couple with murder. Only at that point, in June 1997, were their children taken into care. In his report, read to the court in the cruelty and neglect case, Meadow described the abuse the surviving children suffered as some of the worst he had come across in his 30-year career. It was, he said '10 out of 10 neglect'.</p> <p>Finally in July 1999, the murder prosecution failed. At least 10 similar prosecutions have failed in the past 13 years, from that for the death of 16-month-old Doreen Mason in 1987 right up to that for the killing of 10-week-old Kate Carman last year, whose parents both blamed each other for the 35 broken bones and the ruptured liver she suffered. It is probable there are many more similar cases which never even get to court because the Crown Prosecution Service knows a successful outcome is unlikely.</p> <p>DI Malcolm Bacon, who led the Brighton inquiry, would like to see a change in the law to deal with such cases. 'What I'm saying is that if the prosecution can prove that two people were there when a child was murdered the burden of proof should fall to them to say we were not responsible,' he says. 'It's not as if we're talking about the complete breakdown of the principles of law. Similar requirements apply in handling stolen goods cases where it falls to the defendant to explain how they came by the items.' Others, including Brighton MP Des Turner and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, agree.</p> <p>However, legal experts say any proposed change to deal with the problem is unlikely to succeed. Allan Levy, QC, is a leading child protection barrister and acted for the surviving children in the Brighton case. 'There are grave difficulties with the change being proposed,' he said. 'And I think it will fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights which emphasises the right of defendants to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and which becomes part of British law in October. Obviously the death of any child is horrendous but you can't alter the principles of criminal justice to deal with specific cases.'</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'All legislation is constantly under review. However, there are no plans to alter this particular aspect of law.'</p> <p>Today Brighton Social Services is trying to learn lessons from an inter-agency review of the entire case. It accepted that health professionals had been working with violent individuals and had tried very hard in the circumstances. However, the review said, opportunities to intervene had been missed in an attempt to abide by the spirit of the Children Act, and that there had been a failure of record-keeping.</p> <p>Allan Bowman, chairman of the local Area Child Protection Committee, who was not in post when the incidents occurred, accepts the findings. 'Opportunities were missed,' he says. But he adds, the Children Act that they have to work with does not help.</p> <p>'Legislation never quite keeps up with the reality on the ground,' says Bowman. 'It never reflects the need for flexibility.Here we have a family who do enough to get by and, as a result, we can't be certain that we can justify taking the children into care. If you act too soon and lose and then try again you'll be accused of harassment.' Finally though, in the face of the evidence, the bureaucratic mask slips. 'How the hell did these kids die?' Bowman asks. 'Just what was done to them? What bloody motivation results in this outcome?'</p> <p>It is a good question which no one can answer for certain. Under police questioning Ms X eventually admitted that Mr Y had beaten her repeatedly and stopped her from going to the authorities for help. She also blamed all three smotherings on him. DI Bacon reacted with surprise to this. 'Smothering is quite a subtle method of killing,' he says. 'He was a brutal, fists type of man. Smothering is the sort of method you more readily associate with the female.'</p> <p>There is at least one ray of hope in this story. The five surviving children are said to be thriving in foster care. 'I have never seen children in that condition before in my life,' said one foster mother of their state on arrival at her home. 'They were very hungry and looked at food as though they had not seen it before. They ate with their hands.' Now, says health visitor Betty Chalker, they are all starting to find a kind of happiness. She recalled coming across one of the girls playing with beads and a dressing up box. 'She was given the opportunity to be a little girl and she loved it,' said Chalker. 'She was a different little child.'</p> <p>One morning before the recent cruelty and neglect trial began, the barristers for the prosecution stood around discussing the linguistic problems in the phrase 'wilful neglect': the active process of being inactive. It didn't seem such a difficult concept to me, not where infants are concerned.

It was not about pools of darkness in a childhood filled mostly with light. It was a way of life. These kids woke with it in the morning and they fell asleep to it at night. I can type the last word and go home. You can turn the page.

      "bodyText": "She left them to lie on bedding so soaked in urine and caked in faeces that blowflies took up residence in the house. She changed nappies so irregularly they hung heavy down her children's legs with the weight of their contents. When the nappies leaked, as inevitably they would, she left their legs wet until they became red and sore. Their hair became infested with lice and their feet turned hard and calloused because they had so rarely known shoes. At night, in the darkest hours, the babies were left crying out in hunger because their parents could not be bothered to get out of bed. And when they were fed it was with blended roast dinners and stews, weeks before they were ready even to begin weaning. Hospital appointments to monitor what eventually became life-threatening weight loss in some of the children were never kept and health visitors who tried to intervene were threatened and abused. Last week at Lewes Crown Court the mother of seven from Brighton who, along with her common-law husband, was responsible for this litany of abuse was found guilty of cruelty and neglect. All the police officers, medical experts and social workers involved in the case describe it as among the worst they have ever come across. The husband, already in prison for raping a relativewhen he was a teenager, pleaded guilty at the start of the trial. They will both be sentenced for these offences on 20 March. Those of us who sat through even a portion of the horrendous evidence could take little satisfaction from the guilty verdict. What many of us in the courtroom knew - and the jury did not know - was that the two defendants, who escape being named under injunctions designed to protect the identity of their children, who are now in care, had stood trial together at this court once before. Last July they were both charged with the murders of three children, two of their sons and a nephew. The first died in April 1994, the second and third in March 1997, just 19 days apart. All three died at home when there were no other adults present. At first each was judged a cot death, but after the third a series of leading paediatric pathologists called in by the police found all of them had died by smothering. The couple were arrested and their surviving children placed with foster parents. In police interviews the mother blamed the husband. He said nothing. In court, however, the judge, Mr Justice Moses, directed the jury to acquit. The mother's statements were purely self-serving, he said. What's more, he went on, 'The Crown cannot prove which of the two defendants smothered one or more of these children.' As it was therefore impossible to be certain who was responsible for the killings, or if they acted together, both had to be freed. Children who had been failed first by their parents and then by social services were failed again, this time by the justice system. Now senior police officers are calling for a change in the law. 'There needs to be some way of dealing with joint enterprise,' said Paul Whitehouse, Chief Constable of Sussex, this week. 'We have three people in a room. Two adults come out alive and the child is dead. How can it be right that you cannot convict either of them if they stay silent or blame each other?'

      "body": "<p>The winter death toll of old people is on course to be the highest for more than 20 years, the result of poor housing, disease and neglect. The rise in deaths is particularly shocking because this winter has been unusually mild.</p> <p>The bulge in deaths during winter - officially 'excess winter deaths' - soared last year to around 49,000, the highest level for a decade.</p> <p>Preliminary figures for this winter suggest the toll will be higher still. Five thousand more people had died from December to February than the same period a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The figures are particularly embarrassing for the Government, which has pledged to put an end to fuel poverty and the spectre of old people dying in their homes of cold. They suggest virtually no progress has been made over the past two years.</p> <p>Mervyn Kohler, Head of Public Affairs at Help the Aged, said: 'It's a scandal that so many more pensioners die in a British winter compared to older people living in much colder countries like Sweden and Canada.' In the UK, death rates rise by 31 per cent in the winter, whereas in Germany they rise by just 12 per cent and in Norway by just 10 per cent.</p> <p>Official figures show a relatively small proportion of deaths this winter were due to flu or its complications, such as pneumonia. Far more elderly people are likely to have died from freezing at home. 'Pensioners live in some of the worst housing in the country - many of their homes are cold, damp and badly insulated,' said Kohler.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The winter death toll of old people is on course to be the highest for more than 20 years, the result of poor housing, disease and neglect. The rise in deaths is particularly shocking because this winter has been unusually mild. The bulge in deaths during winter - officially 'excess winter deaths' - soared last year to around 49,000, the highest level for a decade. Preliminary figures for this winter suggest the toll will be higher still. Five thousand more people had died from December to February than the same period a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figures are particularly embarrassing for the Government, which has pledged to put an end to fuel poverty and the spectre of old people dying in their homes of cold. They suggest virtually no progress has been made over the past two years. Mervyn Kohler, Head of Public Affairs at Help the Aged, said: 'It's a scandal that so many more pensioners die in a British winter compared to older people living in much colder countries like Sweden and Canada.' In the UK, death rates rise by 31 per cent in the winter, whereas in Germany they rise by just 12 per cent and in Norway by just 10 per cent. Official figures show a relatively small proportion of deaths this winter were due to flu or its complications, such as pneumonia. Far more elderly people are likely to have died from freezing at home. 'Pensioners live in some of the worst housing in the country - many of their homes are cold, damp and badly insulated,' said Kohler.",

      "body": "<p>It will be enough to drive the Irish to drink: Guinness, favoured by generations of poets, thinkers and romantics from the Emerald Isle, was invented by the Welsh.</p> <p>As people around the world prepare to sink thousands of gallons of the country's most famous export on St Patrick's Day this week, the startling claim that we should be tracing leeks rather than shamrocks on our pints has been made by the inhabitants of a Welsh town.</p> <p>Locals from Llanfairfechan, near Bangor, claim to have identified the site of a tavern from where they claim Arthur Guinness stole the recipe for his famous stout in the 1750s. The Guinness company was this weekend unable to discount the theory.</p> <p>In a twist straight from the firm's advertising campaign - 'Not everything in black and white makes sense' - the Welsh claim suggests that Guinness should be rechristened Gynwys. The drink is made from hops, barley and its secret ingredient - a special yeast. The Irish were once able to claim the drink derived its magical, life-enhancing properties from the addition of water from the River Liffey rather than its 4.1% alcohol content, but today Guinness is a global brand brewed in 50 countries.</p> <p>The company's official history says Arthur Guinness developed his taste for dark ales on visits to London where he drank a brew called porter, named after the porters of Covent Garden and Billingsgate with whom it was especially popular. At the time, porter was almost certainly dark brown rather than black.</p> <p>It has been suggested that before Guinness established his brewery in Dublin in 1759 he may have converted the Irish to porter by importing it from London.

      "bodyText": "It will be enough to drive the Irish to drink: Guinness, favoured by generations of poets, thinkers and romantics from the Emerald Isle, was invented by the Welsh. As people around the world prepare to sink thousands of gallons of the country's most famous export on St Patrick's Day this week, the startling claim that we should be tracing leeks rather than shamrocks on our pints has been made by the inhabitants of a Welsh town. Locals from Llanfairfechan, near Bangor, claim to have identified the site of a tavern from where they claim Arthur Guinness stole the recipe for his famous stout in the 1750s. The Guinness company was this weekend unable to discount the theory. In a twist straight from the firm's advertising campaign - 'Not everything in black and white makes sense' - the Welsh claim suggests that Guinness should be rechristened Gynwys. The drink is made from hops, barley and its secret ingredient - a special yeast. The Irish were once able to claim the drink derived its magical, life-enhancing properties from the addition of water from the River Liffey rather than its 4.1% alcohol content, but today Guinness is a global brand brewed in 50 countries. The company's official history says Arthur Guinness developed his taste for dark ales on visits to London where he drank a brew called porter, named after the porters of Covent Garden and Billingsgate with whom it was especially popular. At the time, porter was almost certainly dark brown rather than black. It has been suggested that before Guinness established his brewery in Dublin in 1759 he may have converted the Irish to porter by importing it from London. But Welsh local historian Deiniol ap Dafydd says it would not have made commercial sense for Arthur Guinness to transport porter all the way from London: the costs would have put the drink beyond most people's pockets. And, he adds, it would have been a risky undertaking. In the eighteenth century the two-day crossing to Dublin was made from Holyhead on Anglesey. But before the construction of bridges at Conwy and the Menai Strait, Holyhead could only be reached by traversing the mountains of Snowdonia - a superhuman feat with a cargo of drink. The claim has been given added weight by the identification of the site where Arthur Guinness is believed to have stopped on the last leg of his journeys to Holyhead. Two cottages are still standing - one known as Llety, the Welsh word for place of rest, was where the mail coach stopped overnight, and the other was then a tavern where a local black ale was brewed. That building is still known by its original name - Gwyn du, or 'black wine'. Ap Dafydd said: 'The ale was renowned for being much darker, smoother and deeper than porter - much more like what we know today as Guinness. 'My view is that Mr Guinness tasted a whole range of local brews on his journey between London and Holyhead, but it was the black wine that took his fancy. It is what was to become Guinness.' Peter Edmondson, who runs the garden centre in Llanfairfechan, adds that old maps of the town show three malting sites used by the pub. 'They would have produced far more malt than could ever have been needed in what was then a village of a few hundred people.' The surplus could have been going to Ireland. A spokesman at the Irish Embassy in London, which will be serving Guinness at an official St Patrick's Day reception on Friday, was sanguine about the Welsh claim. 'I don't think anyone will be worrying about its origins come Friday.'",

Alexander, the MP for Paisley South, was telling them about Operation Turnout, the war plan designed to secure Labour's second term in Westminster. Everywhere a delegate turned in Edinburgh's International Conference centre there was a reminder that New Labour holds electoral success to be its Holy Grail. Every speech hit the themes that the next general election will be fought on. Every policy session was geared towards producing the next manifesto.

The average spent per UK holiday is \u00a3161, compared to e \u00a3400 on an overseas trip, not including the travel to and from the destination. 'More people go abroad for their main holiday because we are just too expensive in Britain,' said Robert Unsworth, editor of The Good Guide to Britain . 'We still persist in charging per person instead of per room and offer worse value than probably anywhere else in the world. But short breaks are a different story. People want the minimum hassle, to go somewhere relaxed with something nice to do. Britain is a good place for that.' Foreign breaks rather than domestic holidays are fuelling the record popularity of getting away. Mintel estimates that 100 million holidays will be taken this year - two million more than in 1999 when the total spending on breaks was \u00a323.5 billion. Spending this year is forecast to reach \u00a324.3 billion. sarah.ryle@observer.co.uk",

'Danny Boy', the bittersweet, non-sectarian song of the homesick Irish exile, is favourite to replace it. As disclosed in The Observer last week, the national anthem's use by the English football and rugby teams has come under increasing criticism in the age of devolution because it celebrates the British state. But it has a special significance for Ulster Protestants and is the unofficial anthem of Glasgow Rangers. Loyalists are expected to resist plans by the Irish Football Association to drop it in an attempt to persuade more Catholics to support the Northern Ireland team. Most Catholics and nationalists stay away from the Windsor Park either out of fear of attack from loyalist hooligans or because they prefer to support the Republic of Ireland. John Quinn, the IFA's spokesman, said dropping 'God Save the Queen' was an option if a revived peace process could restore the Assembly and its power to fund the association's community programme. He explained there were no plans to drop it until after the World Cup in 2002. But he pointed out that the issue would be debated when the association implemented its community relations policy. Quinn said the IFA was the first sporting organisation in Northern Ireland to adopt an anti-sectarian policy, which in theory urges an end to sectarian chanting at local soccer stadiums. Norman Boyd, an Assemblyman for the Northern Ireland Unionist Party and life-long fan of the Ulster Protestant's most favoured football side, Linfield, said the issue should not even be discussed by the IFA. 'If the IFA ever attempted to change the national anthem of my country to something else I would lead a boycott campaign of Windsor Park. I have supported Northern Ireland all my life, I have followed them home and away but I would not go to Windsor if they played a different anthem.

It quickly became apparent to me that a would-be Englishman needed two things to survive: a football team and an accent. The latter was a problem. Almost no one at my school in Hastings spoke with the Sussex drawl of my grandparents - in fact, the few boys who did were ribbed far more remorselessly than I was for my Starsky and Hutch drawl.

Not long ago, the Daily Telegraph, referring to England cricket captain Nasser Hussain, thundered that 'somebody who went to a good university has no business speaking in that ghastly estuary sludge'.</p> <p>So, if Estuary English was unconsciously designed to provide a safe middle ground, free of judgment, it has failed. Alarm has been sparked in the more excitable sections of the media by research suggesting that it is also colonising Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Glasgow. With the BBC and the RSC now embracing non-standard English, the actress Prunella Scales has reportedly assembled a library of posh accents at the National Sound Archive, so future generations will have some idea how to speak Wilde, Coward and Shaw. The implication is that, before long, there will be no posh accents in real life. Even Prince Edward has been chastised for speaking Estuary. The cumulative impression is that our beloved tongue is under attack from this new linguistic virus.</p> <p>But it's not. Professor John Wells of University College, London, is one of our most distinguished linguists. From his office in the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics, he views things differently. 'As often happens in language matters,' he says, 'the English have got into a muddle.' His thesis rests on the assertion that 'the tendency of features of popular London speech to spread out geographically and socially has been going on for 500 years or more - London has always been the chief source of new trends in English.'</p> <p>He thus prefers the (admittedly unwieldy) term 'standard English spoken with the accent of the south-east of England' to the more catchy Estuary, adding that there is now a 'new acceptance of speech patterns associated with the working class, and a disinclination to accept RP as the self-evident norm of pronunciation'.</p> <p>But this is only part of the story. The thing about Estuary is that it provides a good base from which to speak to anyone. Many people's accent seems to change, depending on who they are talking to. Linguists call this process 'accommodation' and we learn to do it from an early age. According to James Crinson, a headmaster on Tyneside who attained his PhD on the strength of a study of the speaking habits of local children, there is no point in trying to correct the language of seven-year-olds, 'because they separate out what's appropriate for certain circumstances'.</p> <p>In his region, he contends, there is a bigger difference between the idioms used by boys and girls than between social classes. He found boys tending to use the Tyneside glottal stop, for instance, with girls preferring either the southern English version, or none at all. Listen to Zo\u00eb Ball interviewing different guests and you will hear her supposedly estuarian accent travel the full distance between cockney and RP. Hers is not a new, homogeneous accent. It is a range of accents. Where past generations might have changed or adapted theirs in order to announce their place in the social order, we - unconsciously, for the most part - use ours in order to neutralise our backgrounds, confound attempts to place or pre-judge us. What we have is a mobile, malleable template, which we customise to suit ourselves and our circumstances.</p> <p>In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Guy Ritchie makes great sport of our enduring social and regional stereotypes which may well be connected to his own attempts to escape them. Perhaps he has. Either way, it's surely good that the rules of engagement with English are now being driven by the most dynamic sector of society, rather than the stuffiest. Put tha' in your pipe and smoke it, Daily Telegwaph !</p>",

According to James Crinson, a headmaster on Tyneside who attained his PhD on the strength of a study of the speaking habits of local children, there is no point in trying to correct the language of seven-year-olds, 'because they separate out what's appropriate for certain circumstances'. In his region, he contends, there is a bigger difference between the idioms used by boys and girls than between social classes. He found boys tending to use the Tyneside glottal stop, for instance, with girls preferring either the southern English version, or none at all. Listen to Zo\u00eb Ball interviewing different guests and you will hear her supposedly estuarian accent travel the full distance between cockney and RP. Hers is not a new, homogeneous accent. It is a range of accents. Where past generations might have changed or adapted theirs in order to announce their place in the social order, we - unconsciously, for the most part - use ours in order to neutralise our backgrounds, confound attempts to place or pre-judge us. What we have is a mobile, malleable template, which we customise to suit ourselves and our circumstances. In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Guy Ritchie makes great sport of our enduring social and regional stereotypes which may well be connected to his own attempts to escape them. Perhaps he has. Either way, it's surely good that the rules of engagement with English are now being driven by the most dynamic sector of society, rather than the stuffiest. Put tha' in your pipe and smoke it, Daily Telegwaph !",

I confess to being struck down by total bafflement afresh each time, usually about halfway through the first act (and again at the same point in the third). That the binding force of the music makes its own compelling sense has too often been an excuse for muddy stagings. Not at Scottish Opera. Constrained by lack of money, inspired to offer clarity for an audience new to the work, its first Parsifal is little short of a miracle.

Parsifal's shooting of the swanl, which alerts us to his arrival, is announced by a spatter of blood dripping down from on high and staining a white cloth, followed by a dazzle of snowy feathers. Klingor's magic castle is a dressing room lit with mirror lights. When Kundry appears, transformed into a temptress, she upstages the fawning, sexless flower maidens in breathtaking style, gliding in 10 feet tall, swathed in yards of red velvet like a crimson sphere.

Matthew Best's Amfortas is pitiful and intelligent, David Pittman-Jennings a sleek Klingsor and Manfred Hemm a refreshingly young, unwoolly and lucid Gurnemanz. In the title role American John Murray struggled vocally with what may have been first-night nerves, but he acted with a touching mix of gormless innocence and growing self-awareness.

John Adams's I was looking at the ceiling and then I saw the sky, a short, punchy, tough and poetic theatre piece, is now on tour in an outstanding staging by Southwark Playhouse and the Modern Music Theatre Troupe. Adams names Leonard Bernstein and George Gershwin as his models. He shares their street-life subject matter with an affect ing tale (libretto by June Jordan) of seven young people in downtown LA whose lives are changed by an earthquake. Provocative issues of police brutality, birth control, gay politics and racism underpin three separate love stories. Adams's loud yet subtle and engaging score has a predominantly jazzy, non-operatic feel, excellently played by an ensemble of keyboard, guitars, clarinet, saxophone and percussion conducted by John Jansson.

The work formed the focus of the CBSO's first Hear Now concert, billed as 'the culmination of the 10-year Towards the Millennium' and conducted by Simon Rattle.

In this gleaming 20-minute piece, for 13 wind and 11 brass instruments, the Finnish composer spun his textures and timbres with clean precision. The cycle of different harmonic and rhythmic moods flickers from skittering to sombre, airy to dense. He teases the instrumental lines apart then presses them back together as if opening and closing a beautifully agile squeeze-box. It is no sin for the listener, freed from an obligation to unearth hidden meaning, to relish Lindberg's power to charm. Sometimes the Grail can be pleasure, and redemption simple enjoyment.</p>",

Writing in the American Scholar, Fadiman recalls the illuminating case of Vice-Admiral James Stockdale, Ross Perot's 1992 running mate, whose favourite book is the Enchiridion of Epictetus, a first-century Greek Stoic philosopher. </p> <p>According to Fadiman, Stockdale first read the Enchiridion at the age of 38 when the US navy sent him to Stanford to study international relations. In the course of his studies, he discovered that whenever Frederick the Great went on his campaigns he took with him a copy of Enchiridion for relaxation. Stockdale, apparently, decided to emulate the great Prussian general. </p> <p>When, in 1966, Stockdale's plane was disabled by flak over North Vietnam, he baled out with a copy of Enchiridion in his back pocket. As he floated down towards certain captivity, Fadiman reports that Stockdale said to himself: \"I am leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.\" </p> <p>This is as stark an example of what Matthew Arnold called \"the powerful and beautiful application of ideas to life\" as one could hope to find in a day's flying. Never mind. The Stoic teaching of Enchiridion enabled Stockdale to survive repeated torture and to emerge from his ordeal with his sense of himself more or less intact. As Fadiman herself wryly puts it: \"I can think of worse ways to use literature.\"</p> <p>The role of literature, its place in our lives and the proper response, if any, to its lessons is one that troubles many of us in this business. It certainly exercises the authors of all these books. Each comes up with his own kind of answer. Terry Eagleton's essay, The Idea of Culture , is, as one might expect, both the most elegant, the most comprehensive and the most demanding. From the outset, he identifies 'culture' as \"one of the two or three most complex words in the English language\". </p> <p>After a dazzling examination of the etymological and epistemological roots of 'culture', he advances to his central \"contention\". This is that \"we are trapped at the moment between disablingly wide and discomfortingly rigid notions of culture\". On the one hand, there is the word's \"anthropological\" deployment to encompass \"everything from hairstyles and drinking habits to how to address your husband's second cousin\". On the other, there's its \"aesthetic\" usage as \"perfection, sweetness and light, the best that has been thought and said\". </p> <p>Neither of these, as Eagleton wittily demonstrates, will do. He is, famously, a Marxist critic and much of his purpose in this self-styled 'manifesto' is to revisit the work of that hero of the cultural Left, Raymond Williams, and especially those books that inspired a generation of students - Culture and Society, Keywords and The Long Revolution. At its best, this volume is as inspiring, incisive and enthralling as I remember Williams to have been. In a better and a more enlightened world, a copy of The Idea of Culture would be sent to every arts student in Britain. </p> <p>So much for appearances. If there is a hidden agenda to Eagleton's essay - and I think there is - it is to upstage a book he does not cite, and to challenge an Oxford colleague he does not name. The book is The Intellectuals and the Masses, the colleague is Professor John Carey. In 1992, Carey set the literary world alight with his eloquent and persuasive analysis of the literary intelligentsia's disdain for the emerging mass culture of late-Victorian England. </p> <p>Part of his book's appeal, at a time when the appropriate response to popular culture was exercising the critics and the commentariat alike, was that it provided a trenchant narrative of the state literary culture was in, a ready and authoritative explanation for the dichotomy between high and low - between, as it were, Milton and Madonna, Flaubert and Friends, Spinoza and the Spice Girls. </p> <p>Implicitly, Eagleton is appalled at Carey's assault on the demigods of modernism - Joyce, Woolf, Lawrence et al - but his mind is too subtle and too feline to say so. Instead, he proposes a model of 'culture' with a capital 'C' that might not stand up to North Vietnamese water torture, but which has the virtue of transcending the banal stupidities of the usual debate about 'dumbing down'. </p> <p>This is not to say that The Idea of Culture is a dry or difficult read. Far from it. Eagleton's pages crackle with aphorism and aper\u00e7us , viz: \"For every waft of Parisian perfume in Tokyo, one can find a young Nazi thug or a middle-aged communitarian philosopher.\" </p> <p>Having explored the idea of \"culture in crisis\", Eagleton moves to the issue which will, I suspect, most interest Observer readers, the question of \"culture wars\". Once again, Eagleton is concerned to explain that, from his perspective, this is \"not just a tussle between Stendhal and Seinfeld, or between those churls on the English department corridor who study line-endings in Milton and the bright young things who write books on masturbation. It is,\" he goes on, \"part of the shape of the world politics of the new millennium.\" Thus, to Eagleton, \"The culture wars which matter concern such questions as ethnic cleansing, not the relative merits of Racine and soap operas.\"</p> <p>All of which suggests that Vice-Admiral Stockdale might have gleaned rather more comfort from Eagleton's brief, brilliant and passionate essay than he could ever have deduced from John Seabrook's Nobrow, a prolix and puzzling volume maddeningly subtitled 'The Culture of Marketing and the Marketing of Culture'. </p> <p>Much is explained by the author's painful experiences in the world of New York's magazine jungle, notably at the New Yorker. Once again, the part I imagine that Observer readers will most enjoy is the part that describes the heaven-and-hell experience of working for Tina Brown. But here and there, amid the tortuous flux of Seabrook's youthful reminiscences, occasional sentences fight their way to the surface, alluding to issues that Eagleton himself would not disdain. \"By the 1990s,\" Seabrook writes, \"the notion that high culture constituted some sort of superior reality, and that the people who made it were superior beings, was pretty much in the toilet. The old meaning of the word culture - something orthodox, dominant and singular - had yielded to the more anthropological Levi-Straussian sense of culture: the characteristic practices of any group.\" </p> <p>If Seabrook, who has coined the term 'nobrow' to cope with his numerous and unresolved worries about the high- and low-brow question in its crudest form, about dumbing down and braining up, is going to get any help in the matter, he would be advised to steer well clear of Dumbing Down, a ragbag of essays on \"culture, politics and the mass media\". </p> <p>This oddly published volume declares, riskily, on its first page that: \"Never in human history has so much cleverness been used to such stupid ends.\" Not content with this opening salvo, Ivo Mosley announces that what he calls 'dumbocracy' is little more than \"the rule of cleverness without wisdom\". </p> <p>The editor has certainly rounded up a quite impressive list of clever contributors, from Philip Rieff and Nicholas Mosley to Michael Oakeshott and Michael Polanyi. There is, sadly, no disguising the fact that, as contributors to a vital contemporary debate, the latter share one distinct disqualification - they are both dead. </p> <p>Vice-Admiral Stockdale, however, is very much alive and still, one hopes, digesting the lessons of Stoicism. Epictetus, it turns out, has apt things to say to those who fear for our culture in the age of the Internet and the video-link: \"Work, therefore, to be able to say to every harsh appearance, 'You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.'\"</p>",

Part of his book's appeal, at a time when the appropriate response to popular culture was exercising the critics and the commentariat alike, was that it provided a trenchant narrative of the state literary culture was in, a ready and authoritative explanation for the dichotomy between high and low - between, as it were, Milton and Madonna, Flaubert and Friends, Spinoza and the Spice Girls. Implicitly, Eagleton is appalled at Carey's assault on the demigods of modernism - Joyce, Woolf, Lawrence et al - but his mind is too subtle and too feline to say so. Instead, he proposes a model of 'culture' with a capital 'C' that might not stand up to North Vietnamese water torture, but which has the virtue of transcending the banal stupidities of the usual debate about 'dumbing down'. This is not to say that The Idea of Culture is a dry or difficult read. Far from it. Eagleton's pages crackle with aphorism and aper\u00e7us , viz: \"For every waft of Parisian perfume in Tokyo, one can find a young Nazi thug or a middle-aged communitarian philosopher.\" Having explored the idea of \"culture in crisis\", Eagleton moves to the issue which will, I suspect, most interest Observer readers, the question of \"culture wars\". Once again, Eagleton is concerned to explain that, from his perspective, this is \"not just a tussle between Stendhal and Seinfeld, or between those churls on the English department corridor who study line-endings in Milton and the bright young things who write books on masturbation. It is,\" he goes on, \"part of the shape of the world politics of the new millennium.\" Thus, to Eagleton, \"The culture wars which matter concern such questions as ethnic cleansing, not the relative merits of Racine and soap operas.\" All of which suggests that Vice-Admiral Stockdale might have gleaned rather more comfort from Eagleton's brief, brilliant and passionate essay than he could ever have deduced from John Seabrook's Nobrow, a prolix and puzzling volume maddeningly subtitled 'The Culture of Marketing and the Marketing of Culture'. Much is explained by the author's painful experiences in the world of New York's magazine jungle, notably at the New Yorker. Once again, the part I imagine that Observer readers will most enjoy is the part that describes the heaven-and-hell experience of working for Tina Brown. But here and there, amid the tortuous flux of Seabrook's youthful reminiscences, occasional sentences fight their way to the surface, alluding to issues that Eagleton himself would not disdain. \"By the 1990s,\" Seabrook writes, \"the notion that high culture constituted some sort of superior reality, and that the people who made it were superior beings, was pretty much in the toilet. The old meaning of the word culture - something orthodox, dominant and singular - had yielded to the more anthropological Levi-Straussian sense of culture: the characteristic practices of any group.\" If Seabrook, who has coined the term 'nobrow' to cope with his numerous and unresolved worries about the high- and low-brow question in its crudest form, about dumbing down and braining up, is going to get any help in the matter, he would be advised to steer well clear of Dumbing Down, a ragbag of essays on \"culture, politics and the mass media\". This oddly published volume declares, riskily, on its first page that: \"Never in human history has so much cleverness been used to such stupid ends.\" Not content with this opening salvo, Ivo Mosley announces that what he calls 'dumbocracy' is little more than \"the rule of cleverness without wisdom\". The editor has certainly rounded up a quite impressive list of clever contributors, from Philip Rieff and Nicholas Mosley to Michael Oakeshott and Michael Polanyi. There is, sadly, no disguising the fact that, as contributors to a vital contemporary debate, the latter share one distinct disqualification - they are both dead. Vice-Admiral Stockdale, however, is very much alive and still, one hopes, digesting the lessons of Stoicism. Epictetus, it turns out, has apt things to say to those who fear for our culture in the age of the Internet and the video-link: \"Work, therefore, to be able to say to every harsh appearance, 'You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.'\"",

      "byline": "Ed Vulliamy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dmitri Shostakovich, the greatest composer of the twentieth century, was a football fanatic. He was, said Maxim Gorky, 'a rabid fan. He comported himself like a little boy, leapt up, screamed and gesticulated' at matches. Shostakovich supported Leningrad Zenith; he would cut short his composing retreats in some rural idyll and return to the city for home games. </p> <p>He exchanged detailed analyses of these matches with friends and kept notebooks of scores and championship league tables, arranged in pyramids. He wanted to come to London to see the 1966 World Cup but was thwarted in his plans. He did, however, make sure to go to Disneyland when in Los Angeles - he loved rollercoaster rides. </p> <p>These vernacular delicacies emerge in a new book about a passionate, tortured man who wrote music about the kernel of what it means to be a human in a violent political society. But in the case of Shostakovich, any biographical fact, however absurd it may seem, is a statement of sorts, since its publication becomes part of the most unforgiving war in the world of music, or probably any of the arts, for that matter - the so-called 'Shostakovich controversy'. Such is the hurricane into which Laurel Fay's Shostakovich: a Life now steps. </p> <p>Fay is quickly finding that it is impossible to write about him without fanning the flames of controversy. No composer's work, not even Wagner's, has been subject to such acrimony. The debate centres on Shostakovich's jagged relationship with the Soviet authorities and with communism, its party and its tyrant, Stalin. </p> <p>At crucial times in his life, Shostakovich was denounced and persecuted, but he also made sure to survive, dedicating much of his work to the cause of the revolution and tardily joining the Communist Party in 1960, having resisted for decades. </p> <p>The claim of the Soviets, their post-Soviet Russian successors and many in the West is that Shostakovich was a believer in the revolution and in the final hour, loyal to the USSR. Not quite that his work is literally party music, but that he could not and did not want to break with the faith or leave the country in the way that Prokofiev, Solzhenitsyn and others did. </p> <p>Against this is pitched a passionate counter-argument by leading musicologists and some of Russia's most illustrious dissidents - that Shostakovich was himself a bitter and brave dissident against communism, whose entire oeuvre was a vast, inner rebellion. One of the principals in the 'dissident' camp, Ian MacDonald, writes: 'The persistent misinterpretation of Shostakovich's music is arguably the most grotesque cultural scandal of our time.' </p> <p>The 'Shostakovich controversy' exploded shortly after the composer's death in 1975, at which time the USSR still claimed his creative soul and ideo- logical loyalty, for all the friction between Shostakovich and the authorities during his life. But in 1979, a memoir called Testimony appeared, purporting to have been narrated by the dying Shostakovich to an acquaintance, Solomon Volkov. </p> <p>Here, the composer lambasts communism and the totalitarian, anti-Semitic state in which 'a man has no significance'. Whether Testimony was genuine or not, no one could have predicted how vituperative the ensuing debate would be. </p> <p>The doomed Soviet authorities, their post-Soviet successors and the composer's family launched a counter-offensive (although Shostakovich's defector son, Maxim, was equivocal). Laurel Fay, joined with Russian scholar Serge Karlinsky to do some detective work, and found Testimony to be, for the most part, spurious and full of plagiarisms. MacDonald then set out to decipher Shostakovich's entire oeuvre , finding it to constitute a coherent and passionate cry of dissent against communism, in musical code. </p> <p>The musicologist Christopher Norris retorted with a conference on 'Shostakovich: the Man and His Music', stating that Volkov had written 'a thoroughly mischievous ideological primer'. The debate was joined by distinguished exiled musicians, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Mstislav Rostropovich, whose lives had been defined by their leaving Russia while Shostakovich had stayed on. </p> <p>Fra from stilling the debate, the collapse of the USSR brought about only a temporary lull. Two years ago came a rabid defence of Volkov in Dmitry Feofanev's Shostakovich Reconsidered, which savaged the claims made in Moscow, and in Fay's research. At a conference in New York shortly after publication, Volkov appeared to deliver what he called his 'first and last' defence of the veracity of his memoir. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the war has been waged on the Net. MacDonald has his own, intelligent website, arguing with ever-greater passion for his theory of Shostakovich's great coded weave. He and his supporters accuse Norris of 'Stalinism' for defending the composer's apparent loyalty to Marxism. </p> <p>Norris has, in turn, mocked MacDonald and 'Western liberals' for thinking themselves 'too shrewd' for the Russian version. 'Redrick' is another Internet regular taking the Russian line and assailing the dissidents as inhabiting 'cultish Internet backwaters where neither evidence or logic carry much weight'. Each side accuses the other of 'fraud', 'deceit' and 'revisionism'. </p> <p>Amidst the acrimony Fay continues to takes the Staten Island ferry to work at the music publisher G. Shirmer's on Park Avenue. </p> <p>'This isn't the book I wanted to write,' she confesses; that was intended to be about Shostakovich's music. But then she was admitted, after some years of studying music in Leningrad, into 'a library-like room, and there was his life; it was quite a moment' - the moment at which Fay became the first Western writer ever to gain access to the Shostakovich archive. </p> <p>The result is a deliberately dry book which will infuriate many, if only because of its refusal to discuss either the music or the controversy. Rather, it tries to cut a neutral, biographical, factual furrow through both. It is what Fay calls 'a platform, a factual record upon which other work can build'. It is both minimalist and crammed with detail, devoid of interpretation and built upon what Shostakovich himself can be proven to have said and done, rather than 'all those people who speak for Shostakovich'. Fay constructs a life story which, she says, accounts for the fact that 'people change with time and age.

Fay remembers from her time living in Leningrad the way in which 'people are forced to live on so many different levels'. Shostakovich, she says, 'lived his life very publicly', and was, therefore, constrained to exist on different and often contradictory planes. 'It is not as though things just happened to him - he made choices, and I am inter ested in those choices.' Shostakovich's conductor friend Kyril Kondrashin called him 'the moral conscience of music in Russia'. Maxim, the composer's son, said: 'My father was a patriot for his people, which is not the same as being a party apparatchik.'

      "bodyText": "Dmitri Shostakovich, the greatest composer of the twentieth century, was a football fanatic. He was, said Maxim Gorky, 'a rabid fan. He comported himself like a little boy, leapt up, screamed and gesticulated' at matches. Shostakovich supported Leningrad Zenith; he would cut short his composing retreats in some rural idyll and return to the city for home games. He exchanged detailed analyses of these matches with friends and kept notebooks of scores and championship league tables, arranged in pyramids. He wanted to come to London to see the 1966 World Cup but was thwarted in his plans. He did, however, make sure to go to Disneyland when in Los Angeles - he loved rollercoaster rides. These vernacular delicacies emerge in a new book about a passionate, tortured man who wrote music about the kernel of what it means to be a human in a violent political society. But in the case of Shostakovich, any biographical fact, however absurd it may seem, is a statement of sorts, since its publication becomes part of the most unforgiving war in the world of music, or probably any of the arts, for that matter - the so-called 'Shostakovich controversy'. Such is the hurricane into which Laurel Fay's Shostakovich: a Life now steps. Fay is quickly finding that it is impossible to write about him without fanning the flames of controversy. No composer's work, not even Wagner's, has been subject to such acrimony. The debate centres on Shostakovich's jagged relationship with the Soviet authorities and with communism, its party and its tyrant, Stalin. At crucial times in his life, Shostakovich was denounced and persecuted, but he also made sure to survive, dedicating much of his work to the cause of the revolution and tardily joining the Communist Party in 1960, having resisted for decades. The claim of the Soviets, their post-Soviet Russian successors and many in the West is that Shostakovich was a believer in the revolution and in the final hour, loyal to the USSR. Not quite that his work is literally party music, but that he could not and did not want to break with the faith or leave the country in the way that Prokofiev, Solzhenitsyn and others did. Against this is pitched a passionate counter-argument by leading musicologists and some of Russia's most illustrious dissidents - that Shostakovich was himself a bitter and brave dissident against communism, whose entire oeuvre was a vast, inner rebellion. One of the principals in the 'dissident' camp, Ian MacDonald, writes: 'The persistent misinterpretation of Shostakovich's music is arguably the most grotesque cultural scandal of our time.' The 'Shostakovich controversy' exploded shortly after the composer's death in 1975, at which time the USSR still claimed his creative soul and ideo- logical loyalty, for all the friction between Shostakovich and the authorities during his life. But in 1979, a memoir called Testimony appeared, purporting to have been narrated by the dying Shostakovich to an acquaintance, Solomon Volkov. Here, the composer lambasts communism and the totalitarian, anti-Semitic state in which 'a man has no significance'. Whether Testimony was genuine or not, no one could have predicted how vituperative the ensuing debate would be. The doomed Soviet authorities, their post-Soviet successors and the composer's family launched a counter-offensive (although Shostakovich's defector son, Maxim, was equivocal). Laurel Fay, joined with Russian scholar Serge Karlinsky to do some detective work, and found Testimony to be, for the most part, spurious and full of plagiarisms. MacDonald then set out to decipher Shostakovich's entire oeuvre , finding it to constitute a coherent and passionate cry of dissent against communism, in musical code. The musicologist Christopher Norris retorted with a conference on 'Shostakovich: the Man and His Music', stating that Volkov had written 'a thoroughly mischievous ideological primer'. The debate was joined by distinguished exiled musicians, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Mstislav Rostropovich, whose lives had been defined by their leaving Russia while Shostakovich had stayed on. Fra from stilling the debate, the collapse of the USSR brought about only a temporary lull. Two years ago came a rabid defence of Volkov in Dmitry Feofanev's Shostakovich Reconsidered, which savaged the claims made in Moscow, and in Fay's research. At a conference in New York shortly after publication, Volkov appeared to deliver what he called his 'first and last' defence of the veracity of his memoir. Meanwhile, the war has been waged on the Net. MacDonald has his own, intelligent website, arguing with ever-greater passion for his theory of Shostakovich's great coded weave. He and his supporters accuse Norris of 'Stalinism' for defending the composer's apparent loyalty to Marxism. Norris has, in turn, mocked MacDonald and 'Western liberals' for thinking themselves 'too shrewd' for the Russian version. 'Redrick' is another Internet regular taking the Russian line and assailing the dissidents as inhabiting 'cultish Internet backwaters where neither evidence or logic carry much weight'. Each side accuses the other of 'fraud', 'deceit' and 'revisionism'. Amidst the acrimony Fay continues to takes the Staten Island ferry to work at the music publisher G. Shirmer's on Park Avenue. 'This isn't the book I wanted to write,' she confesses; that was intended to be about Shostakovich's music. But then she was admitted, after some years of studying music in Leningrad, into 'a library-like room, and there was his life; it was quite a moment' - the moment at which Fay became the first Western writer ever to gain access to the Shostakovich archive. The result is a deliberately dry book which will infuriate many, if only because of its refusal to discuss either the music or the controversy. Rather, it tries to cut a neutral, biographical, factual furrow through both. It is what Fay calls 'a platform, a factual record upon which other work can build'. It is both minimalist and crammed with detail, devoid of interpretation and built upon what Shostakovich himself can be proven to have said and done, rather than 'all those people who speak for Shostakovich'. Fay constructs a life story which, she says, accounts for the fact that 'people change with time and age. And that Shostakovich was damaged psychologically by what happened to him'. She follows the life charted by a passionate, tormented, often isolated man in a society where synergy between art and politics was unavoidable. But such is the intensity of the debate that by avoiding it, Fay is seen by the 'dissident' camp as endorsing the Soviet view (which she does not) simply by recording Shostakovich's own public endorsements of communism (as well as his digressions and hostility) without comment, rather than presuming them to be ironic. The negative reviews have begun - cold criticism in the New York Times, a savaging in the Washington Post - and will certainly continue. 'They're already calling me a Soviet stooge,' she sighs.

      "body": "<p>Sadly, Parkinson's disease has been at the forefront of my mind twice in the past few months: Michael J Fox recently announced that he is giving up work to devote more time to fighting the disease and, closer to home, the sister of a treasured friend has just discovered that it is responsible for her muscle weakness and tremor.</p> <p>Parkinson's affects approximately one per cent of people over the age of 50 and can also hit people in their twenties and thirties. We still don't know what exactly causes this disease, but it's a chronic, progressive disorder of the nervous system, resulting from the degeneration of certain brain cells. These brain cells produce a substance called dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter; in other words it helps the nerves communicate messages to one another. Without dopamine the nervous system falters.</p> <p>Parkinson's commonly starts with a tremor in one arm that occurs when the arm is at rest. As the disease progresses, movements gradually become more rigid, walking and balancing become difficult, the face can become frozen (speech and swallowing can become problematical), and there is progressive difficulty in performing simple tasks we take for granted, such as dressing ourselves - which can become impossible. The time that elapses between the first symptoms (typically a tremor or weakness) and when the more debilitating scenarios kick in varies greatly, but the degenerative path this disease follows means that Parkinson's affects not only the individual but also everyone around them - as time goes by, the sufferer frequently has to rely heavily on others for help. In Britain, there are only about two people with Parkinson's under each GP; many practitioners don't know the best ways of dealing with the disease, so it's essential to find a neurologist who has an interest in it.</p> <p>No one can deny that Parkinson's disease is a distressing condition, but since the discovery of drugs such as Levodopa, the prognosis has changed dramatically. Levodopa restores the deficiency of dopamine within the brain by providing the brain with the amino acid L-Dopa (L dihydroxy-phenylalanine) from which the dopamine is derived. Levodopa remains the 'gold standard' of Parkinson's therapy as it's the most potent anti-Parkinson's drug available (although a few people fail to respond to this therapy). Long-term use of Levodopa often leads to complications later in this disease, most importantly dyskinesia, (uncontrolled movements) and in the short term, side effects such as depression and extreme tiredness (which usually occur when you first start taking the drug), both of which can make this medication route far from ideal. Thus many specialists now like to consider the use of other drugs, and the trend in treatment is toward combination therapy - the substitution or addition of other drugs at different times in the disease's progression. Some specialists may also consider surgery - either the removal or electronic stimulation of certain cells in the brain which control tremor and balance, or more recently and controversially, scientists are looking at the implantation of (pig) foetal tissue to restore the brain's ability to produce dopamine. Currently, surgery remains a less common option - for the majority of people, drugs provide the core of their conventional therapy.</p> <p>But it's not just the drugs that need attention, food has a major role to play; it not only helps the body remain as fit and healthy as possible, which is vital in this degenerative disease, but more specifically what we eat has a relationship with L-Dopa. Before exploring this specific drug-food relationship, there are a couple of other wider issues. First, the importance of having a well-balanced, antioxidant-rich diet (fruits, vegetables, etc), since there is some evidence to suggest that free radical damage can be involved in the progression of Parkinson's - and boosting antioxidants counteracts this damage. Your diet also needs to include plenty of calcium and vitamin D-rich foods (dairy products, oily fish, etc) to ensure the bones remain as sturdy as possible. You may become unbalanced and/or weak, as the disease progresses - if you fall over, brittle bones are more likely to fracture. If you suspect that your intake of calcium and vitamin D is low, discuss taking supplements with your specialist. Constipation can also be a significant problem, not only because it causes discomfort, but because it interferes with the absorption of Levodopa - so try to keep your intake of fibre (wholegrain breads, pulses, cereals, fruits and vegetables, etc) and water high.</p> <p>The major food issue to address, however, is what to eat when you're taking Levodopa. This drug is taken orally and is absorbed most effectively through the upper part of the small intestine, the part encountered by food as it leaves the stomach. It's best taken on an empty stomach, as there are nutritional factors which in some people can interfere with the metabolism and ultimately the efficacy of the drug. In some individuals, certain amino acids (molecules within protein) interfere with the metabolism of L-Dopa; if these protein-sensitive people eat protein foods and take the drug at the same time, L-Dopa will not be able to work efficiently in the body.</p> <p>You might think that the simplest thing to do would be to cut out protein, but this would lead to other malnutrition problems. Protein is essential in maintaining a healthy muscle system and is also needed to keep the immune system feisty. In fact, all you need to do is separate concentrated sources of protein from the drug doses, so that your body can glean the protein and respond well to the treatment. Your specialist will be able to advise you as to the time you should leave between taking your medication and eating protein-rich foods (meat, poultry, fish and eggs - the slower absorption of protein from pulses such as dried beans, peas and lentils makes them less of a problem). However, leaving an hour before you eat seems to be commonly advised. I cannot give an exact time, because everyone's metabolism is different.</p> <p>Other foods such as cereal-based carbohydrates (pasta, rice, bread, potatoes, etc) and dairy products also contain protein, but in a less concentrated form, so these, and of course vegetables and fruits, will not interfere with the actions of the drug. So if you take Levodopa and want something to eat before your curfew time, these are the foods to choose. Base breakfast and lunch on carbohydrates (porridge, honey on toast with banana, cereals, etc, for breakfast; risotto, pasta or a simple non-protein sandwich - jam or peanut butter etc, for lunch) and save the protein (roast chicken, fish casseroles, meat, eggs, etc) until the evening meal, eating it an hour after you have taken your last dose of medication. It's important to stick to this sort of structure, in meal quantity, quality and timing - if you vary things too much, the action of the drugs may be compromised.</p> <p>As the disease progresses, a vicious circle can develop: the disease can weaken and depress you, and it can be so physically difficult to prepare and eat meals that the desire to eat can disappear. Lack of nutrients leads to more depression, chronic fatigue, weight loss and reduced physical strength, all of which compound the problems of dealing with Parkinson's. The best way to tackle these problems is to eat small meals often. Simple meals such as egg on toast or a rich soup are generally better managed than a whole roast lunch. Fruit fools, egg custard, souffl\u00e9s and omelettes slip down easily, if swallowing is difficult. Keep ahead of the game, by having simple-to-prepare foods such as cheese, sliced meats, individual portions of home-made soups and vegetable flans in stock. Having cake tins stocked with nutritious bakes such as fruity maltloaf, flapjacks or biscuits can help you satisfy hungry moments and keep on top of the disease.</p> <p>You can contact the Parkinson's Society on 020 7931 8080; or call the national freephone helpline on 0808 800 0303</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sadly, Parkinson's disease has been at the forefront of my mind twice in the past few months: Michael J Fox recently announced that he is giving up work to devote more time to fighting the disease and, closer to home, the sister of a treasured friend has just discovered that it is responsible for her muscle weakness and tremor. Parkinson's affects approximately one per cent of people over the age of 50 and can also hit people in their twenties and thirties. We still don't know what exactly causes this disease, but it's a chronic, progressive disorder of the nervous system, resulting from the degeneration of certain brain cells. These brain cells produce a substance called dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter; in other words it helps the nerves communicate messages to one another. Without dopamine the nervous system falters. Parkinson's commonly starts with a tremor in one arm that occurs when the arm is at rest. As the disease progresses, movements gradually become more rigid, walking and balancing become difficult, the face can become frozen (speech and swallowing can become problematical), and there is progressive difficulty in performing simple tasks we take for granted, such as dressing ourselves - which can become impossible. The time that elapses between the first symptoms (typically a tremor or weakness) and when the more debilitating scenarios kick in varies greatly, but the degenerative path this disease follows means that Parkinson's affects not only the individual but also everyone around them - as time goes by, the sufferer frequently has to rely heavily on others for help. In Britain, there are only about two people with Parkinson's under each GP; many practitioners don't know the best ways of dealing with the disease, so it's essential to find a neurologist who has an interest in it. No one can deny that Parkinson's disease is a distressing condition, but since the discovery of drugs such as Levodopa, the prognosis has changed dramatically. Levodopa restores the deficiency of dopamine within the brain by providing the brain with the amino acid L-Dopa (L dihydroxy-phenylalanine) from which the dopamine is derived. Levodopa remains the 'gold standard' of Parkinson's therapy as it's the most potent anti-Parkinson's drug available (although a few people fail to respond to this therapy). Long-term use of Levodopa often leads to complications later in this disease, most importantly dyskinesia, (uncontrolled movements) and in the short term, side effects such as depression and extreme tiredness (which usually occur when you first start taking the drug), both of which can make this medication route far from ideal. Thus many specialists now like to consider the use of other drugs, and the trend in treatment is toward combination therapy - the substitution or addition of other drugs at different times in the disease's progression. Some specialists may also consider surgery - either the removal or electronic stimulation of certain cells in the brain which control tremor and balance, or more recently and controversially, scientists are looking at the implantation of (pig) foetal tissue to restore the brain's ability to produce dopamine. Currently, surgery remains a less common option - for the majority of people, drugs provide the core of their conventional therapy. But it's not just the drugs that need attention, food has a major role to play; it not only helps the body remain as fit and healthy as possible, which is vital in this degenerative disease, but more specifically what we eat has a relationship with L-Dopa. Before exploring this specific drug-food relationship, there are a couple of other wider issues. First, the importance of having a well-balanced, antioxidant-rich diet (fruits, vegetables, etc), since there is some evidence to suggest that free radical damage can be involved in the progression of Parkinson's - and boosting antioxidants counteracts this damage.

That the West was conned by the Kosovo Liberation Army into joining a secessionist conflict on their side. That the Nato conflict was designed to punish Milosevic for the failures of the international community over Bosnia.

But there is something deeply unsatisfactory about this account of why Nato went to war in Kosovo. Unsatisfactory because - as ever - it is about us, not them; because it is an account that is only interested in the neat transposition of European and American ideological arguments on to the Balkans. In the past seven years or so, the Balkan wars have thrown up two kinds of book. First, there are the glib volumes that place the writer's (often puzzled, sometimes horrified) experience at the centre of the examination of the Balkan mystery.

The difficulty with revisionary accounts of what happened in Kosovo in the lead-up to the war and after is that they operate on the assumption that the nascent KLA (around 150 strong as the civil war began) was cohesive in its strategy, philosophy or aims; that tying Nato into the conflict was always intended, rather than a cry of help as the full weight of the Serb forces was unleashed against the mountain villages that summer. </p> <p>One of those who repeats this claim is Michael Ignatieff. His Virtual War is a patchy and rather unsatisfactory book, including (at rather too great length) his correspondence with Robert Skidelsky on whether Nato was right to intervene. Ignatieff never seems to get below the surface detail or beyond what Ignatieff is feeling.

      "body": "<p>Researchers at the distinguished Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have just released the results of a long-term study into the relationship between a person's state of mind and how long they live. A sample group of 839 people were interviewed between 1962 and 1965, and graded according to their degree of optimism or pessimism. The same group was surveyed 30 years later, and it was found that the pessimists had a 19 per cent greater likelihood of premature death than the optimists. 'The survey tells us that mind and body are linked,' says Dr Toshihiko Maruta, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist, 'and that attitude has an impact on the final outcome, death.' In other words, academics have now confirmed what many of us have long believed: that positive thinking leads to a longer and healthier life.</p> <p>Researchers have known for more than 20 years that the health of animals suffers when they feel helpless about negative events beyond their control, and more recent studies have indicated that humans who feel similarly are more likely to experience not only depression, but physical illness and premature death. The Mayo study draws conclusive parallels between modes of thinking and health. After reading the report, Professor Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania Psychology Department advocates using programmes for pessimistic people to 'change their thinking and so lower their risk of physical illness and even death'. The authors of the Mayo report came to the same conclusion. At last, the traditionally sceptical academic community is starting to accept that positive thinking should be used in health care.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence has existed for years. Cures for anything from headaches to cancer have been attributed, wholly or partially, to a positive mental approach. This makes sense when you consider that the part of the brain relating to subconscious activity is a purely functional aspect of the mind. It knows exactly how to direct the nervous and physical human structure, to cause us to walk, talk or perform any other physical action. It also responds to instruction. When your conscious mind decides to walk, the subconscious will respond by causing the necessary nervous interactions. Neuroscientists do not yet know exactly how this happens - but they know that it does. In the same way, the subconscious mind will respond to positive or negative suggestions. So if you consciously think you are getting better during an illness, the subconscious mind will work with that suggestion and you will tend to improve (and vice versa for negative feelings).</p> <p>This basic principle has been proved by the so-called 'placebo effect'. Researchers have given patients neutral pills which should have no effect whatsoever on them, but because the patient has been told it is a beneficial medicine, they get better. Their subconscious mind has been programmed with the idea that they are going to get better and so they do. Colin Rose published the details of a survey in 1985, which was conducted at Travis Air Force Base in California. Doctors rated 152 cancer patients at the base as to whether they had a positive or negative expectation of recovery. Without exception, the patients with positive expectations had more successful remission rates. Only two of the patients with negative expectations showed any response to treatment at all. The physician at the base stated that: 'A positive attitude towards treatment was a better predictor of treatment than was the severity of the disease.' This shows just how potent subconscious programming can be - in this case through expectation.</p> <p>Hypochondria is on the opposite side of the coin to the placebo effect. Believing you are ill can cause you to become so. A study conducted at the Ottawa General Hospital Department of Medicine in Canada, and published in 1987 by Dr Herbert Benson, illustrates this well. It looked at 63 women and 43 men who had experienced pain and attributed it to a heart condition. X-rays showed that none of these patients was at any significant risk from coronary illness or death, and the patients were informed accordingly. Despite this, many of them still persisted in believing that they had a problem. A year later it was found that those who held on to this belief were still experiencing pain, while most of the others were either free of pain, or experienced it at a reduced level.</p> <p>Now that academic evidence exists, establishing attitude and belief as a potent force in programming the subconscious mind - either positively or negatively - it is to be hoped it will be incorporated into the treatment of patients. It would be wonderful to think that a visit to a GP might soon include patients being instructed on the benefits of positive thought. On the basis of this report, it will certainly improve their health.</p> <p>Try the following tips for positive thinking:</p> <p>\u0095 If you tell yourself that you are better when you are not, the subconscious will react against this and prove you wrong. The suggestion should always be that you will improve, not that you have already done so.</p> <p>\u0095 The famous positive suggestion, 'Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better', is as good a starting place as any. By repeating it you are programming the subconscious mind to help you get better.</p> <p>\u0095 You can qualify this by specifying an ailment, eg: 'Every day, in every way, my left leg is getting better and better.'</p> <p>\u0095 Repeat an affirmation out loud for maximum effect.</p> <p>\u0095 Use your imagination as well as your intellect. The left side of the brain governs rational thought, and the right, creative thought. By visualising yourself getting better as well as just thinking it in a form of words, both aspects of the brain are used, and the results will be more effective.</p> <p>\u0095 Breathe as deeply and evenly as possible when you practise visualisation for increased focus.</p> <p>\u0095 If you practise positive thinking last thing at night, your subconscious will work on it during your sleep.</p> <p>Richard Lawrence runs workshops at The Inner Potential Centre, 36 Kelvedon Road, London SW6 (for enquiries, call 020 7736 4187 or email <a href=\"http://www.innerpotential.org)\" target=\"_NEW\">www.innerpotential.org)</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Researchers at the distinguished Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have just released the results of a long-term study into the relationship between a person's state of mind and how long they live. A sample group of 839 people were interviewed between 1962 and 1965, and graded according to their degree of optimism or pessimism. The same group was surveyed 30 years later, and it was found that the pessimists had a 19 per cent greater likelihood of premature death than the optimists. 'The survey tells us that mind and body are linked,' says Dr Toshihiko Maruta, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist, 'and that attitude has an impact on the final outcome, death.' In other words, academics have now confirmed what many of us have long believed: that positive thinking leads to a longer and healthier life. Researchers have known for more than 20 years that the health of animals suffers when they feel helpless about negative events beyond their control, and more recent studies have indicated that humans who feel similarly are more likely to experience not only depression, but physical illness and premature death. The Mayo study draws conclusive parallels between modes of thinking and health. After reading the report, Professor Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania Psychology Department advocates using programmes for pessimistic people to 'change their thinking and so lower their risk of physical illness and even death'. The authors of the Mayo report came to the same conclusion. At last, the traditionally sceptical academic community is starting to accept that positive thinking should be used in health care. Anecdotal evidence has existed for years. Cures for anything from headaches to cancer have been attributed, wholly or partially, to a positive mental approach. This makes sense when you consider that the part of the brain relating to subconscious activity is a purely functional aspect of the mind. It knows exactly how to direct the nervous and physical human structure, to cause us to walk, talk or perform any other physical action. It also responds to instruction. When your conscious mind decides to walk, the subconscious will respond by causing the necessary nervous interactions. Neuroscientists do not yet know exactly how this happens - but they know that it does. In the same way, the subconscious mind will respond to positive or negative suggestions. So if you consciously think you are getting better during an illness, the subconscious mind will work with that suggestion and you will tend to improve (and vice versa for negative feelings). This basic principle has been proved by the so-called 'placebo effect'. Researchers have given patients neutral pills which should have no effect whatsoever on them, but because the patient has been told it is a beneficial medicine, they get better. Their subconscious mind has been programmed with the idea that they are going to get better and so they do. Colin Rose published the details of a survey in 1985, which was conducted at Travis Air Force Base in California. Doctors rated 152 cancer patients at the base as to whether they had a positive or negative expectation of recovery. Without exception, the patients with positive expectations had more successful remission rates. Only two of the patients with negative expectations showed any response to treatment at all. The physician at the base stated that: 'A positive attitude towards treatment was a better predictor of treatment than was the severity of the disease.' This shows just how potent subconscious programming can be - in this case through expectation. Hypochondria is on the opposite side of the coin to the placebo effect. Believing you are ill can cause you to become so. A study conducted at the Ottawa General Hospital Department of Medicine in Canada, and published in 1987 by Dr Herbert Benson, illustrates this well. It looked at 63 women and 43 men who had experienced pain and attributed it to a heart condition. X-rays showed that none of these patients was at any significant risk from coronary illness or death, and the patients were informed accordingly. Despite this, many of them still persisted in believing that they had a problem. A year later it was found that those who held on to this belief were still experiencing pain, while most of the others were either free of pain, or experienced it at a reduced level. Now that academic evidence exists, establishing attitude and belief as a potent force in programming the subconscious mind - either positively or negatively - it is to be hoped it will be incorporated into the treatment of patients. It would be wonderful to think that a visit to a GP might soon include patients being instructed on the benefits of positive thought. On the basis of this report, it will certainly improve their health. Try the following tips for positive thinking: \u0095 If you tell yourself that you are better when you are not, the subconscious will react against this and prove you wrong. The suggestion should always be that you will improve, not that you have already done so. \u0095 The famous positive suggestion, 'Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better', is as good a starting place as any. By repeating it you are programming the subconscious mind to help you get better. \u0095 You can qualify this by specifying an ailment, eg: 'Every day, in every way, my left leg is getting better and better.' \u0095 Repeat an affirmation out loud for maximum effect. \u0095 Use your imagination as well as your intellect. The left side of the brain governs rational thought, and the right, creative thought. By visualising yourself getting better as well as just thinking it in a form of words, both aspects of the brain are used, and the results will be more effective. \u0095 Breathe as deeply and evenly as possible when you practise visualisation for increased focus. \u0095 If you practise positive thinking last thing at night, your subconscious will work on it during your sleep.

The novel opens with Rebus, appointed police liaison to the Parliament, on a tour of Queensberry House, the ancient building being refurbished to provide the new institution's residence. Much guff has been talked about the sense of place in crime fiction, but Edinburgh is the shaping force for the Rebus series. Rebus is drawn to the city's bloody past and you can't get much bloodier than an act of cannibalism in Queensberry House around the time of the Act of Union in 1707, when a madman killed a young servant and roasted him on a spit. </p> <p>In the course of his tour, archaeologists uncover the fireplace where the youth died and a recent murder victim comes to light. When the body of Roddy Grieve, a prospective MSP from a well-known Edinburgh family, is discovered in the gardens of Queensberry House, the scene is set for an immensely satisfying police procedural. </p> <p>Under pressure from above to solve the murder of Grieve as quickly as possible, Rebus is not surprised to find there are people willing to do anything to capitalise on Scottish independence, especially when it comes to profiting from Edinburgh's booming land values. His survival becomes questionable when he finds himself up against an old enemy, a powerful villain he hoped he'd put away for years to come. </p> <p>Rebus is a masterful creation (one shortly to be incarnated by John Hannah in the television adaptation of Black and Blue and The Hanging Garden). At the beginning of the series, Rankin kitted him out with a junkie brother, a past life in the SAS, a stage hypnotist father and a \"smart-arse, postgraduate joke name\" (author's words). </p> <p>Over the years, Rankin has modified him - his musical taste changed abruptly from jazz to rock when John Harvey's jazz-loving Resnick came on the scene; his SAS background has been fondly debunked. In deepening the characterisation with each novel, Rankin has made Rebus into the most interesting crime protagonist around. In consequence, over the past three years, Rankin has taken his well-earned place among the top echelon of crime writers. </p> <p>American writer George P Pelecanos, meanwhile, is heavily tipped to be the Next Big Thing. <strong> Shame the Devil </strong> is the sixth of his hip, hardboiled thrillers to be published in Britain. Born, raised and still living in Washington DC, Pelecanos writes with passion and commitment about the plight of the working classes in the American capital's crime-ridden inner city. </p> <p>His 'DC Quartet', of which Shame the Devil is the final part, looks at the impact of drugs and the crime they bring over three decades in the ethnically mixed inner urban areas. It opens with a pizza-parlour robbery which turns into a bloodbath - staff shot in cold blood; the gunman's brother killed by a cop; a young boy run over by a getaway car. </p> <p>Three years later, the gunman heads back to Washington to even the score over his brother's death by killing everyone involved. This story is set against the background of a police department in disarray, a former general parachuted in to run the capital's school system and Congress appointing a control board with a white Texan city manager to oversee a city, 80% of whose residents are black. </p> <p>The DC Quartet has been likened to James Ellroy's LA Quartet but the books have little in common. Pelecanos doesn't go in for Ellroy's stylistic pyrotechnics, convoluted plots and complex narratives. He prefers to focus on a single incident and let a story develop from its consequences. Music plays an important part in the feel of the quartet: it has a soundtrack of the coolest music of the different periods embedded in it, as do his other novels. </p> <p>Shame the Devil shows once again that Pelecanos is a powerful writer, a deft stylist with a good ear for the nuances and rhythms of street speech. He deserves to be listed among the best - the fluency of his dialogue alone matches that of the masters, Leonard and McBain. </p> <p>Joseph Glass's <strong> Blood </strong> would be much improved if he (or she? The name is a pseudonym for \"a New York Times bestselling author\") weren't so clunky with both internal and external dialogue. The sequel to Eyes, in which we first met psychic psychiatrist Dr Susan Shader, has the requisite number of thrills and an overabundance of spills (of the red stuff, naturally, given the title) but is little more than formulaic.

      "bodyText": "Set in Darkness by Ian Rankin Orion, \u00a316.99, pp415 Buy it from BOL Shame the Devil by George P Pelecanos Victor Gollancz, \u00a39.99, pp299 Buy it from BOL Blood by Joseph Glass Macmillan, \u00a316.99, pp499 Buy it from BOL From Conan Doyle to Colin Dexter, crimewriters have chafed against the limitations a long-running mystery series imposes on them. Set in Darkness is Ian Rankin's eleventh novel featuring the choleric, compassionate loner, Detective Inspector John Rebus, but if the author is feeling constrained, there's no sign of it here. The starting point for Set in Darkness is the establishment of the new Scottish Parliament. The novel opens with Rebus, appointed police liaison to the Parliament, on a tour of Queensberry House, the ancient building being refurbished to provide the new institution's residence. Much guff has been talked about the sense of place in crime fiction, but Edinburgh is the shaping force for the Rebus series. Rebus is drawn to the city's bloody past and you can't get much bloodier than an act of cannibalism in Queensberry House around the time of the Act of Union in 1707, when a madman killed a young servant and roasted him on a spit. In the course of his tour, archaeologists uncover the fireplace where the youth died and a recent murder victim comes to light. When the body of Roddy Grieve, a prospective MSP from a well-known Edinburgh family, is discovered in the gardens of Queensberry House, the scene is set for an immensely satisfying police procedural. Under pressure from above to solve the murder of Grieve as quickly as possible, Rebus is not surprised to find there are people willing to do anything to capitalise on Scottish independence, especially when it comes to profiting from Edinburgh's booming land values. His survival becomes questionable when he finds himself up against an old enemy, a powerful villain he hoped he'd put away for years to come. Rebus is a masterful creation (one shortly to be incarnated by John Hannah in the television adaptation of Black and Blue and The Hanging Garden). At the beginning of the series, Rankin kitted him out with a junkie brother, a past life in the SAS, a stage hypnotist father and a \"smart-arse, postgraduate joke name\" (author's words). Over the years, Rankin has modified him - his musical taste changed abruptly from jazz to rock when John Harvey's jazz-loving Resnick came on the scene; his SAS background has been fondly debunked. In deepening the characterisation with each novel, Rankin has made Rebus into the most interesting crime protagonist around. In consequence, over the past three years, Rankin has taken his well-earned place among the top echelon of crime writers. American writer George P Pelecanos, meanwhile, is heavily tipped to be the Next Big Thing. Shame the Devil is the sixth of his hip, hardboiled thrillers to be published in Britain. Born, raised and still living in Washington DC, Pelecanos writes with passion and commitment about the plight of the working classes in the American capital's crime-ridden inner city. His 'DC Quartet', of which Shame the Devil is the final part, looks at the impact of drugs and the crime they bring over three decades in the ethnically mixed inner urban areas. It opens with a pizza-parlour robbery which turns into a bloodbath - staff shot in cold blood; the gunman's brother killed by a cop; a young boy run over by a getaway car. Three years later, the gunman heads back to Washington to even the score over his brother's death by killing everyone involved. This story is set against the background of a police department in disarray, a former general parachuted in to run the capital's school system and Congress appointing a control board with a white Texan city manager to oversee a city, 80% of whose residents are black. The DC Quartet has been likened to James Ellroy's LA Quartet but the books have little in common. Pelecanos doesn't go in for Ellroy's stylistic pyrotechnics, convoluted plots and complex narratives. He prefers to focus on a single incident and let a story develop from its consequences. Music plays an important part in the feel of the quartet: it has a soundtrack of the coolest music of the different periods embedded in it, as do his other novels. Shame the Devil shows once again that Pelecanos is a powerful writer, a deft stylist with a good ear for the nuances and rhythms of street speech. He deserves to be listed among the best - the fluency of his dialogue alone matches that of the masters, Leonard and McBain. Joseph Glass's Blood would be much improved if he (or she? The name is a pseudonym for \"a New York Times bestselling author\") weren't so clunky with both internal and external dialogue. The sequel to Eyes, in which we first met psychic psychiatrist Dr Susan Shader, has the requisite number of thrills and an overabundance of spills (of the red stuff, naturally, given the title) but is little more than formulaic. It's the psychic in pursuit of the psychotic. There's a serial killer on the loose called the Undertaker, who is obsessed with women's blood and virginity. Shader is the only one who can stop him because when there are no more clues to work from, she has psychic insights to move the plot along. The problem is she likes to explain her insights at length, and she always talks as if she has just swallowed a textbook. The psychology lectures masquerading as conversation are bad and the brief chitchat between her and a cop on blood symbolism in Romeo and Juliet excruciating, but my favourite moment is when she's pondering the cop's gunshot wound. \"In Gold's case empyema of the damaged lung was also to be feared. If it happened, the doctors would have to insert a drainage tube in the area, in order to get rid of the purulent exudate.\" The purulent exudate? Who said words are puny things?",

In recent months I have visited a series of big-ticket openings in London - Asia de Cuba, Between Six and Eight (now renamed Seven), and most recently Twentyfour - and found gross fault with each. None of them delivered anything approaching value for an awful lot of money.

I always find myself anticipating a certain delicacy and precision with Chinese food which rarely transpires. Here, that's exactly what you get. We were advised by the staff that we would need at least three starters between two. This was not an attempt to up the bill but an accurate representation of their size. A single soft-shell crab came in a light batter and dressed with a fine dice of chilli, garlic and spring onions. The sweetness of the seafood played beautifully against the saltiness of the batter. Smoked, shredded chicken came with intense flavour bombs of roasted garlic.

We literally ate the plate. Tender, succulent pieces of honey-glazed pork came with a tempura of plantain and courgette and crisp green beans were dressed in a light black bean and ginger sauce.

The story consists of the gradual revelation of their true relations to each other. We learn about Theobald's arrival from England after the death of his mother, with whom he lived, his self-imposed homesickness (much manifested in the importation and ingestion of British sweets), the setting up of his caravan, cottage garden and cactus garden in the desert and his own blossoming in size, serenity and fatherhood. </p> <p>How this solitary and profoundly clueless man ever connected with a female, however, remains a mystery.

      "bodyText": "Sunset Over Chocolate Mountains by Susan Elderkin Fourth Estate, \u00a39.99, pp306 This novel's first sentence could easily have qualified it for the \"novels we never finished reading\" list: \"When he moved to the mountains of Arizona and set up home amongst the giant saguaros of the Sonoran Desert, Theobald Moon developed the habit of getting up early in the morning, peeing in a glass, and knocking it back in a few quick gulps while it was still warm and fresh.\" Amazingly, despite this - as well as reading books such as A Manual for Living Comfortably in the Cosmos and weighing hundreds of pounds, Theobald is strangely taking, as are his eventual adored daughter, Josephine, two passionate Slovakian lovers and even the improbable Jersey, who talks like a cowboy out of an old western, is descended from Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s (is it a joke that it's not Jerzy?), and helps timid, fat Theobald from sheer goodness. Somehow, these fanciful misfits curled their little tendrils around my sentiment-resistant heart. The story consists of the gradual revelation of their true relations to each other. We learn about Theobald's arrival from England after the death of his mother, with whom he lived, his self-imposed homesickness (much manifested in the importation and ingestion of British sweets), the setting up of his caravan, cottage garden and cactus garden in the desert and his own blossoming in size, serenity and fatherhood. How this solitary and profoundly clueless man ever connected with a female, however, remains a mystery. We assume he slept with someone, unimaginable though such an event must be, and hope there is at least a bittersweet memory. For Josephine, however, as she grows, this holding out on basic information becomes central. All she has of her mother are pairs of mostly elegant but wrong-size shoes, which Theobald begins giving her on her seventh birthday, and from which she tries to deduce the rest of her mother. Theobald won't even tell her so much as her mother's name. In Slovakia, meanwhile - or, as it emerges, somewhat earlier in time - the beautiful Eva, with her hair in a provincial crimp, works in a shoe factory and sneaks off to the woods for liaisons with the even more beautiful Tibor, who may or may not be Romany but has a gypsy's wandering ways, selling homemade ice-cream from a travelling van.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The American world of letters is feting a new literary sensation, a semi-reclusive and deliberately difficult young author who is being acclaimed as a 'genius' in the mould of Kierkegaard, James Joyce and William Burroughs. </p> <p>David Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is already in its third imprint in the United States, despite its apparently unpromising subject matter - a memoir on the death of his two parents and his experience of raising his young brother. </p> <p>The few readings that he has given have been packed out with fans of his previous ventures - not least the hugely obscure McSweeney's magazine which he edits and publishes. </p> <p>A bidding war for the international rights is rumoured to have seen offers of deals running to several million dollars, while Eggers has turned down a $2 million offer for the film rights on the ground that a film would 'be too painful'. </p> <p>The book has been greeted with extraordinary reviews. </p> <p>Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times literary critic with notoriously little patience for the avant-garde, has described Eggers as a 'staggeringly talented new writer', while the author Lawrence Weschler has written that 'when Kierkegaard got in this deep - this endlessly, self-ironisingly, loopily, down-spiralling deep - he had to rely on God to save him. But Eggers somehow manages to save himself.' </p> <p>'What moved me,' he says, 'is that from this generation supposedly incapable of reading came something so sophisticated, yet so full of undefeated wonder, formed and educated, but which has the ability to marvel.' </p> <p>The Boston Globe, for its part, said Eggers's book 'defies gravity'; 'a book of infinite jest,' Sara Mosle called it in the New York Times . </p> <p>All this about a book filled with grim humour and opacity, which takes as its subject matter death and Eggers's love for his young brother. </p> <p>Born in the Chicago suburb, and now living in a chaotic Brooklyn bedsit, Eggers's life is marked by encounters with tragedy. His parents both died of cancer when he was 21, leaving him to take care of his eight-year-old brother, Toph. </p> <p>But there are other awful incidents that he deals with with a casual aplomb. </p> <p>'Jeff called,' writes Eggers in one memorable passage, 'and said we had better go over to Ricky's because something terrible had happened. \"What happened?\" \"Ricky's dad doused himself with gasoline and lit a match and ran around the yard on fire and then stopped running and died\" ... we walked to Ricky's. He was in the family room watching TV ... they were showing a video for a Bob Dylan song called \"Joker Man\". We liked the video.' </p> <p>His friend John attempts suicide with almost comic regularity but the deaths of Eggers's alcoholic father and stoic mother spare nothing. The physical decomposition of his parents and the stench of death are comfortless and unrelenting. </p> <p>Eggers leaves Chicago and establishes a doomed satirical magazine called Might as he cares for Toph. </p> <p>Eggers has not read and cannot, he says, read his own account of the denouement, when he returns to Chicago to stumble upon his mother's 'cremains' and scatter them into Lake Michigan - a moment of ruthless self-parody. </p> <p>The story of the book, of Eggers's real life and how it was written, has come to be the stuff of instant legend - written between midnight and 4am almost every night for a year. To add to this legend, Eggers has reviewed his own book (of which he claims he has yet to see a copy) in Spin magazine - and panned it. He has also arranged a competition on the website of the Amazon Internet bookshop, offering whoever writes the best review a lifetime subscription to the journal that he edits. The only condition is that the book is be awarded five stars under the site's reviewing system and that the reviewer must be able to prove they have not read it. </p> <p>Such Dadaist interventions are familiar to Eggers's existing fans. His assault on American letters has not been without some forewarning through the quarterly journal McSweeney's which - now in its fourth issue - has gained cult status. </p> <p>It is McSweeney's, published by Eggers himself, that lays out his manifesto, and he concedes that it could not be 'weirder'. Weschler says its is about 'love of words and love of being'. </p> <p>None of this, however, gets to the bottom of a phenomenon that has been selling out with each subsequent issue. </p> <p>The third issue of McSweeney's - filled with graphical and textual tricks - looked like Granta, the British literary magazine. </p> <p>It is the content that confounds. There are articles like 'Plausible: Provincial Beginnings for Stories Which Might Never Be Written But Could'. Such as: 'After rubbing his eyes, a man becomes permanently blurred.' </p> <p>The fourth issue is packaged in a box containing 14 elegant pamphlets, each a single article. </p> <p>But just as one gets used to the idea that McSweeney's is about playing with words, a rumour reaches The Observer that the next issue will have no text at all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The American world of letters is feting a new literary sensation, a semi-reclusive and deliberately difficult young author who is being acclaimed as a 'genius' in the mould of Kierkegaard, James Joyce and William Burroughs. David Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is already in its third imprint in the United States, despite its apparently unpromising subject matter - a memoir on the death of his two parents and his experience of raising his young brother. The few readings that he has given have been packed out with fans of his previous ventures - not least the hugely obscure McSweeney's magazine which he edits and publishes. A bidding war for the international rights is rumoured to have seen offers of deals running to several million dollars, while Eggers has turned down a $2 million offer for the film rights on the ground that a film would 'be too painful'. The book has been greeted with extraordinary reviews. Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times literary critic with notoriously little patience for the avant-garde, has described Eggers as a 'staggeringly talented new writer', while the author Lawrence Weschler has written that 'when Kierkegaard got in this deep - this endlessly, self-ironisingly, loopily, down-spiralling deep - he had to rely on God to save him. But Eggers somehow manages to save himself.' 'What moved me,' he says, 'is that from this generation supposedly incapable of reading came something so sophisticated, yet so full of undefeated wonder, formed and educated, but which has the ability to marvel.' The Boston Globe, for its part, said Eggers's book 'defies gravity'; 'a book of infinite jest,' Sara Mosle called it in the New York Times . All this about a book filled with grim humour and opacity, which takes as its subject matter death and Eggers's love for his young brother. Born in the Chicago suburb, and now living in a chaotic Brooklyn bedsit, Eggers's life is marked by encounters with tragedy. His parents both died of cancer when he was 21, leaving him to take care of his eight-year-old brother, Toph. But there are other awful incidents that he deals with with a casual aplomb. 'Jeff called,' writes Eggers in one memorable passage, 'and said we had better go over to Ricky's because something terrible had happened. \"What happened?\" \"Ricky's dad doused himself with gasoline and lit a match and ran around the yard on fire and then stopped running and died\" ... we walked to Ricky's. He was in the family room watching TV ... they were showing a video for a Bob Dylan song called \"Joker Man\". We liked the video.' His friend John attempts suicide with almost comic regularity but the deaths of Eggers's alcoholic father and stoic mother spare nothing. The physical decomposition of his parents and the stench of death are comfortless and unrelenting. Eggers leaves Chicago and establishes a doomed satirical magazine called Might as he cares for Toph. Eggers has not read and cannot, he says, read his own account of the denouement, when he returns to Chicago to stumble upon his mother's 'cremains' and scatter them into Lake Michigan - a moment of ruthless self-parody. The story of the book, of Eggers's real life and how it was written, has come to be the stuff of instant legend - written between midnight and 4am almost every night for a year. To add to this legend, Eggers has reviewed his own book (of which he claims he has yet to see a copy) in Spin magazine - and panned it. He has also arranged a competition on the website of the Amazon Internet bookshop, offering whoever writes the best review a lifetime subscription to the journal that he edits. The only condition is that the book is be awarded five stars under the site's reviewing system and that the reviewer must be able to prove they have not read it. Such Dadaist interventions are familiar to Eggers's existing fans. His assault on American letters has not been without some forewarning through the quarterly journal McSweeney's which - now in its fourth issue - has gained cult status. It is McSweeney's, published by Eggers himself, that lays out his manifesto, and he concedes that it could not be 'weirder'. Weschler says its is about 'love of words and love of being'. None of this, however, gets to the bottom of a phenomenon that has been selling out with each subsequent issue. The third issue of McSweeney's - filled with graphical and textual tricks - looked like Granta, the British literary magazine. It is the content that confounds. There are articles like 'Plausible: Provincial Beginnings for Stories Which Might Never Be Written But Could'. Such as: 'After rubbing his eyes, a man becomes permanently blurred.' The fourth issue is packaged in a box containing 14 elegant pamphlets, each a single article. But just as one gets used to the idea that McSweeney's is about playing with words, a rumour reaches The Observer that the next issue will have no text at all.",

He was speaking of West Cork, the part of Ireland where I live, in a 19th-century farmhouse in the luminous shadow of Mount Gabriel - where, legend has it, the last wolf in Ireland was killed.</p> <p>The devil he was referring to had murdered du Plantier\u2019s 39-year-old wife, Sophie, on a moonlit night just before Christmas 1996. It was the first murder in these remote parts since Civil War days, when Michael Collins was killed in Beal na Blath, the Gap of the Blossoms, a few miles inland.</p> <p>I had spent the days before that Christmas with my companion, the novelist Elizabeth Wassell - who helped to research and write this article - at the Literary Forum in Okinawa, an elongated, serrated island that regards its larger neighbour with much the same ambivalence as Ireland does England. We had gone there from Tokyo, where I had been granted an audience with the Empress. Irish poets vie for the longest meeting with her, and I had out-talked Seamus Heaney by a good 30 minutes. But my contentment waned on the flight home, when I read news of the murder and realised we were heading back into turbulence.</p> <p>Cork is the largest county in Ireland, and West Cork, the scene of the crime, is its most ruggedly beautiful part, with its shipwrecking seas and its bony mountains clothed in heather and gorse. Its centre is the town of Skibbereen, beyond which gleam the seaside villages of Schull, Goleen, and Crookhaven. Roaringwater Bay is necklaced with islands, and three finger peninsulas - Mizen Head, Sheep\u2019s Head, and Beara - jut into the often wild Atlantic. </p> <p>Although this region is historically insular (electricity wasn\u2019t introduced here until 1954), over the past two decades expatriates and artists have begun to pour in. The Heinz and newspaper magnate Tony O\u2019Reilly, Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack, and David Puttnam all have summer houses in West Cork. Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant were beaten to the house of their choice by a rock band. Even Tony Blair has spent holidays here, and the region has become known as \u2018the Irish Riviera\u2019.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum are the unemployed, an invading army, since, under the terms of the European Union, anyone with a European passport can settle in Ireland and draw the dole. West Cork has become a Mecca for the eccentric, the lost children of Europe. Many - such as the New Age hippies of Coole Mountain, a commune of several hundred families whose pot-smoking disturbs the garda\u00ed - are in flight from over-industrialised European centres. One year, they descended on our village to enact a Dionysiac summer-solstice ceremony, burning a giant effigy and dancing to the beat of tasselled tambourines.</p> <p>Still, despite a recent slight increase in petty larceny, the savage murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier was the first incidence of serious violence in the area, and the first crime to have international implications. In the ensuing criminal investigation, two jurisdictions and legal systems have collided, provoking debates in the Irish parliament and creating an uproar in the British and French media.</p> <p>Sophie Bouniol had met Daniel Toscan du Plantier in 1990, when she was 33 and he was 49. She soon became du Plantier\u2019s third wife. The head of the French Academy of Cinema Arts and a close friend of President Jacques Chirac, du Plantier also ran a film-production company, the projects of which included Peter Greenaway\u2019s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover, and he had been made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, France\u2019s highest cultural honour, that year. </p> <p>Sophie had the delicate, slightly unconventional style of a Left Bank Parisienne and the birdlike elegance of Mimou. When du Plantier met her, she wanted to act; he convinced her to try a new career as a documentary producer and scriptwriter, for the cultural Channel Arte, with which he was connected. Sophie also had a romanticised image of the Irish countryside, which she had visited briefly in her youth. In 1993, du Plantier bought a bulky five-bedroom house in Schull, which would serve as Sophie\u2019s refuge from her high-profile life in France. She was often photographed at her husband\u2019s side at media events, but she also slipped away to Ireland four or five times a year. Occasionally she would bring someone with her - her teenage son from her first marriage, or another member of her family - but du Plantier joined her only once, and she was listed in the local telephone directory under her maiden name. Among the locals, she had a reputation as something of a loner. For a while she even feuded with her nearest neighbour over a shared gate that she felt should stay closed.</p> <p>On Friday, 20 December 1996, Sophie landed at Cork Airport (the security video shows her trundling a surprising amount of luggage) and drove to her house along the winding coast road in a rented Ford Fiesta. She chatted briefly with Denis Quinlan at the Courtyard Bar, in Schull, and with Tom Brosnan, the jovial owner of the Spar supermarket, both of whom she knew well. Over the weekend she visited many of her local haunts, including O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Pub, on the quayside in Crookhaven, a village that has recently become so popular with visiting French yachtsmen that it\u2019s known as \u2018little Saint-Tropez\u2019. She also went for a walk on bleak Three Castle Head and called on some friends, with whom she had a strange, melancholy conversation. She said that, while walking, she had come upon the ruins of Dun Lough - or Black Lake - Castle, and had sensed some kind of menace. According to legend, the lake next to the castle is home to a female ghost who, if glimpsed, is supposed to be a harbinger of death. Afterwards, Sophie decided to return to Paris on 24 December, a few days earlier than she\u2019d originally intended. That Sunday, she called her husband at 11pm and had what he recalls was a \u2018convivial\u2019 conversation.</p> <p>At 10 o\u2019clock the next morning, a neighbour found Sophie\u2019s body in the lane leading to her house. She was wearing a nightshirt, leggings, and high, brown lace-up boots, and had been bludgeoned more than a dozen times with a weapon like a poker or possibly a hatchet. A large stone or concrete building block had been dropped on her head, crushing her skull. There was evidence of a struggle. Sophie was a small woman - only 5ft tall - but she had clearly put up a fight: there was blood under her fingernails and she was clutching a clump of hair. Neighbours reported having heard wild cries in the night, which they had assumed were the yowls of mating foxes.</p> <p>Yet no murder weapon was found, Sophie\u2019s house seemed untouched, and there was no indication of sexual assault. It was said that there were two rinsed wineglasses by the kitchen sink (a local garda told us later that this was \u2018a bit of a myth\u2019) and two chairs drawn up to the radiator. It had been a frosty night and, by the time the state pathologist arrived, 24 hours later - having driven the 230 miles from Dublin - rigor mortis had set in and it was too late to determine the time of Sophie\u2019s death.</p> <p>The story broke in the Irish papers, with many of the details provided first by a local freelance journalist named Ian Bailey, who was working as a stringer for the Cork Examiner and had been one of the first reporters on the scene. But, days later, a rumour began that a woman who\u2019d been walking home from her lover\u2019s house at dawn on the night of the murder said she had spotted a man who resembled Bailey washing his boots in a stream. Others noticed cuts and scratches on his head and hands (which he said he\u2019d got from killing Christmas turkeys and cutting down an aggressive Christmas tree). There was also a rumour that he\u2019d been seen burning clothes on the morning after the murder. Seven weeks later, the garda\u00ed arrested Bailey and his Welsh girlfriend, Jules Thomas.</p> <p>We knew Bailey, though he had been living in the area for only five years. Born in 1956, the son of a butcher, Bailey had grown up in Gloucestershire, where he attended the Crypt Grammar School and later played for Gloucester\u2019s Old Cryptians rugby club. His size and strength made him an ideal second-row forward. He started working for the Gloucester &amp; County News Service in 1975. In his reporting, Bailey specialised in espionage stories and gave a lot of ink to GCHQ - the intelligence agency in nearby Cheltenham. A journalist who worked closely with Bailey at the time remembers how \u2018he talked big. He was always bursting with ideas for making his fame and fortune.\u2019 In 1980, Bailey married another journalist, but the marriage soon ended in a divorce that he describes as \u2018acrimonious\u2019, and that the various newspaper accounts called \u2018sordid\u2019 and \u2018bitter\u2019. In 1991, after brief stints in London and in the United States, Bailey settled in West Cork.</p> <p>We first met him one night in the winter of 1994. After a lecture at the West Cork Arts Centre, Elizabeth and I stopped in a Ballydehob pub. Next to us at the bar was a tall, striking man in his late thirties, with long dark hair, black eyebrows, and a snaggle-toothed grin. He introduced himself in a crisp English accent and gave us his card, which identified him as \u2018Eoin Bailey\u2019. He mentioned his interest in gardening, and we phoned him soon afterwards to ask whether we could hire him to take care of our garden, as we were often travelling and unable to do it ourselves. He agreed.</p> <p>Frequently, as he bustled around in the garden (and what a peculiar historical satisfaction it was for an Irishman to gaze out the window at his English servant), we would notice that he had hurt himself with a scythe or a sickle - a clumsiness we found surprising in someone who was otherwise so athletic. (Elizabeth speculated that he might have an \u00fcbermensch complex. I thought he was just awkward.) Once, we had to find Mercurochrome and bandages to staunch the blood. Bailey also smoked heavily, and I can hardly think of him without seeing his eyes narrowed against the smoke of his hand-rolled cigarette.</p> <p>After he had been working for us for almost a year, Bailey showed me his collected works - scraps of songs and poem-ballads - and I encouraged him in his writing. There was a glimmer of talent there, but it needed a level of discipline which he seemed unprepared to give. He had made a minor reputation for himself, reciting poetry and banging the bodhran - an Irish goatskin drum - at O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Pub, in Ballydehob, and he seemed to prefer the gratifications of the pub\u2019s indulgent audience to the tedious, concentrated work of a serious writer. At the annual Irish Seanachie - a storytelling festival - on Cape Clear Island, Ian Bailey transformed himself into Eoin Bailey or, sometimes, O\u2019Baille. As he described it in one poem, \u2018The tall Eoin Bailey, he chipped in his bit,/with his poems on life he proved a big hit.\u2019</p> <p>On one occasion, he borrowed a typewriter that had been gathering dust in our house since we\u2019d switched to computers. I worried later that I might have lent my typewriter to Raskolnikov, but I felt a vaguely paternal affection for Bailey back then, and saw him as an older version of the troubled young men I had dealt with as a teacher. Above all, I saw him as a victim of the English class system, a butcher\u2019s son educated at a \u2018good\u2019 grammar school where he learned to read Latin but lost his social moorings, who craved acceptance in the more bohemian society of West Cork.</p> <p>My Collected Poems were published in the autumn of 1995, and Bailey came to a reading in Cork, an occasion that was somewhat eclipsed by torrential rain. After the reading, there was a launch party, where Bailey mingled easily with the assembled literati in a round room overlooking the River Lee, the setting of Spenser\u2019s \u2018Epithalamion\u2019.</p> <p>That Christmas, Bailey and Jules Thomas invited us to dinner in their remote farmhouse, which stands on an expanse of rugged land called Lioscaha (\u2018the Fairy Fort\u2019), in a region affectionately known as the Prairie. It was a cold night, the sky black and starless, but they welcomed us enthusiastically. Jules put a homemade p\u00e2t\u00e9 on their big wooden dining table, alongside chunks of toasted and buttered home-baked bread. A handsome woman in her late forties, Jules is a painter of land- and seascapes, which are conventional but skillful in their composition. She has lived in West Cork for more than 20 years and her love life has been mildly untraditional, but eccentric behaviour is generally tolerated here, at least among the expatriates.</p> <p>Her three daughters joined us at dinner. The middle daughter is a fledgling artist and she showed us her portfolio. The 18-year-old was warm and courteous, but we sensed an unease between her and Bailey. During dinner, the youngest daughter complained that the Christmas tree had not yet been brought into the house. At first, Bailey placated her with an indulgent smile and continued eating, but when she persisted he got up abruptly, left the house, then lumbered back in with a large tree shivering under his arm, scattering needles across the floor.</p> <p>Bailey continued to work for us through that winter and the following spring. He started leaving us little notes, addressed with whimsical grandiloquence, \u2018To the Bard, John, and the Lady, Elizabeth,\u2019 usually on the subject of our lush garden: \u2018I came up on Thursday, the only dry day of the week - I gave the grass a thrashing.\u2019 When we were away in March, we received a St Patrick\u2019s Day card in which he reported: \u2018You lost a couple of branches in the storms - but nothing you would notice.\u2019</p> <p>It was obvious, though, when we returned a few weeks later, that the garden had been neglected - the grass was tangled and knee-high, the boughs unpruned, weeds encroaching on herbs and flowers. We learned from our former housekeeper that Bailey and Jules had broken up. Then he wrote us a different kind of letter, still grandiloquent, but painfully vulnerable as well: \u2018Dear John, A chara\u2019 - Gaelic for \u2018friend\u2019 - \u2018It is under very sad and tragic circumstances I write to you and it is difficult to know where to start. On 2 May, Jules and myself were coming back from a party - I was driving and an argument broke out. It ended in a fight - we had both been drinking and were very tired. I unintentional [sic] hurt Jules, and her daughter called the guards... [I]t\u2019s all quite awful - Jules is deeply upset - neither of us in spite of what has happened want to part and I love her stronger than ever... Please don\u2019t think to [sic] badly of me. I never intended to hurt hurt [sic] - it was the drink and I am now resolved to abstinence.\u2019</p> <p>Jules was indeed hurt. She had been taken to Bantry General Hospital and needed reconstructive surgery on her jaw. Jules later told us that Bailey had suffered a blackout that night, caused by the abundance of poteen he\u2019d drunk. She did not press charges against him, although the garda\u00ed told us she could have. Meanwhile, Bailey took shelter with a friend in nearby Skibbereen, convinced (correctly) that he would eventually be back together with Jules. Then he telephoned to ask whether he could continue to work on our garden.</p> <p>We were torn. We had been horrified by the violence of the attack and were concerned about the extent to which his emotional instability might affect us in the future. But we also felt that he was genuinely contrite and ashamed. In the end, we agreed to let him come back. Once or twice he came with another man, and because late summer and early autumn were warm that year they worked bare-chested, brandishing hooks and sickles to crop the dense foliage.</p> <p>Once, as he drank his tea, he spoke to us about the beating. At first Elizabeth encouraged him, thinking that if he could confront his shame he might become more responsible. But his face hardened and he began to talk about his \u2018enemies\u2019 on the Prairie, the people who were conniving to get rid of him. Jules\u2019s daughters, he said, were among them. We noticed shortly afterward that he had truncated his pledge to renounce drink: presumably beer, wine and stout had ceased to count. </p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/mar/12/life1.lifemagazine11\">here</a> for the rest of this article</p>",

It had been a frosty night and, by the time the state pathologist arrived, 24 hours later - having driven the 230 miles from Dublin - rigor mortis had set in and it was too late to determine the time of Sophie\u2019s death. The story broke in the Irish papers, with many of the details provided first by a local freelance journalist named Ian Bailey, who was working as a stringer for the Cork Examiner and had been one of the first reporters on the scene. But, days later, a rumour began that a woman who\u2019d been walking home from her lover\u2019s house at dawn on the night of the murder said she had spotted a man who resembled Bailey washing his boots in a stream. Others noticed cuts and scratches on his head and hands (which he said he\u2019d got from killing Christmas turkeys and cutting down an aggressive Christmas tree). There was also a rumour that he\u2019d been seen burning clothes on the morning after the murder. Seven weeks later, the garda\u00ed arrested Bailey and his Welsh girlfriend, Jules Thomas. We knew Bailey, though he had been living in the area for only five years. Born in 1956, the son of a butcher, Bailey had grown up in Gloucestershire, where he attended the Crypt Grammar School and later played for Gloucester\u2019s Old Cryptians rugby club. His size and strength made him an ideal second-row forward. He started working for the Gloucester &amp; County News Service in 1975. In his reporting, Bailey specialised in espionage stories and gave a lot of ink to GCHQ - the intelligence agency in nearby Cheltenham. A journalist who worked closely with Bailey at the time remembers how \u2018he talked big. He was always bursting with ideas for making his fame and fortune.\u2019 In 1980, Bailey married another journalist, but the marriage soon ended in a divorce that he describes as \u2018acrimonious\u2019, and that the various newspaper accounts called \u2018sordid\u2019 and \u2018bitter\u2019. In 1991, after brief stints in London and in the United States, Bailey settled in West Cork. We first met him one night in the winter of 1994. After a lecture at the West Cork Arts Centre, Elizabeth and I stopped in a Ballydehob pub. Next to us at the bar was a tall, striking man in his late thirties, with long dark hair, black eyebrows, and a snaggle-toothed grin. He introduced himself in a crisp English accent and gave us his card, which identified him as \u2018Eoin Bailey\u2019. He mentioned his interest in gardening, and we phoned him soon afterwards to ask whether we could hire him to take care of our garden, as we were often travelling and unable to do it ourselves. He agreed. Frequently, as he bustled around in the garden (and what a peculiar historical satisfaction it was for an Irishman to gaze out the window at his English servant), we would notice that he had hurt himself with a scythe or a sickle - a clumsiness we found surprising in someone who was otherwise so athletic. (Elizabeth speculated that he might have an \u00fcbermensch complex. I thought he was just awkward.) Once, we had to find Mercurochrome and bandages to staunch the blood. Bailey also smoked heavily, and I can hardly think of him without seeing his eyes narrowed against the smoke of his hand-rolled cigarette. After he had been working for us for almost a year, Bailey showed me his collected works - scraps of songs and poem-ballads - and I encouraged him in his writing. There was a glimmer of talent there, but it needed a level of discipline which he seemed unprepared to give. He had made a minor reputation for himself, reciting poetry and banging the bodhran - an Irish goatskin drum - at O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Pub, in Ballydehob, and he seemed to prefer the gratifications of the pub\u2019s indulgent audience to the tedious, concentrated work of a serious writer. At the annual Irish Seanachie - a storytelling festival - on Cape Clear Island, Ian Bailey transformed himself into Eoin Bailey or, sometimes, O\u2019Baille. As he described it in one poem, \u2018The tall Eoin Bailey, he chipped in his bit,/with his poems on life he proved a big hit.\u2019 On one occasion, he borrowed a typewriter that had been gathering dust in our house since we\u2019d switched to computers. I worried later that I might have lent my typewriter to Raskolnikov, but I felt a vaguely paternal affection for Bailey back then, and saw him as an older version of the troubled young men I had dealt with as a teacher. Above all, I saw him as a victim of the English class system, a butcher\u2019s son educated at a \u2018good\u2019 grammar school where he learned to read Latin but lost his social moorings, who craved acceptance in the more bohemian society of West Cork. My Collected Poems were published in the autumn of 1995, and Bailey came to a reading in Cork, an occasion that was somewhat eclipsed by torrential rain. After the reading, there was a launch party, where Bailey mingled easily with the assembled literati in a round room overlooking the River Lee, the setting of Spenser\u2019s \u2018Epithalamion\u2019. That Christmas, Bailey and Jules Thomas invited us to dinner in their remote farmhouse, which stands on an expanse of rugged land called Lioscaha (\u2018the Fairy Fort\u2019), in a region affectionately known as the Prairie. It was a cold night, the sky black and starless, but they welcomed us enthusiastically. Jules put a homemade p\u00e2t\u00e9 on their big wooden dining table, alongside chunks of toasted and buttered home-baked bread. A handsome woman in her late forties, Jules is a painter of land- and seascapes, which are conventional but skillful in their composition. She has lived in West Cork for more than 20 years and her love life has been mildly untraditional, but eccentric behaviour is generally tolerated here, at least among the expatriates. Her three daughters joined us at dinner. The middle daughter is a fledgling artist and she showed us her portfolio. The 18-year-old was warm and courteous, but we sensed an unease between her and Bailey. During dinner, the youngest daughter complained that the Christmas tree had not yet been brought into the house. At first, Bailey placated her with an indulgent smile and continued eating, but when she persisted he got up abruptly, left the house, then lumbered back in with a large tree shivering under his arm, scattering needles across the floor. Bailey continued to work for us through that winter and the following spring. He started leaving us little notes, addressed with whimsical grandiloquence, \u2018To the Bard, John, and the Lady, Elizabeth,\u2019 usually on the subject of our lush garden: \u2018I came up on Thursday, the only dry day of the week - I gave the grass a thrashing.\u2019 When we were away in March, we received a St Patrick\u2019s Day card in which he reported: \u2018You lost a couple of branches in the storms - but nothing you would notice.\u2019 It was obvious, though, when we returned a few weeks later, that the garden had been neglected - the grass was tangled and knee-high, the boughs unpruned, weeds encroaching on herbs and flowers. We learned from our former housekeeper that Bailey and Jules had broken up. Then he wrote us a different kind of letter, still grandiloquent, but painfully vulnerable as well: \u2018Dear John, A chara\u2019 - Gaelic for \u2018friend\u2019 - \u2018It is under very sad and tragic circumstances I write to you and it is difficult to know where to start. On 2 May, Jules and myself were coming back from a party - I was driving and an argument broke out. It ended in a fight - we had both been drinking and were very tired. I unintentional [sic] hurt Jules, and her daughter called the guards... [I]t\u2019s all quite awful - Jules is deeply upset - neither of us in spite of what has happened want to part and I love her stronger than ever... Please don\u2019t think to [sic] badly of me. I never intended to hurt hurt [sic] - it was the drink and I am now resolved to abstinence.\u2019 Jules was indeed hurt. She had been taken to Bantry General Hospital and needed reconstructive surgery on her jaw. Jules later told us that Bailey had suffered a blackout that night, caused by the abundance of poteen he\u2019d drunk. She did not press charges against him, although the garda\u00ed told us she could have. Meanwhile, Bailey took shelter with a friend in nearby Skibbereen, convinced (correctly) that he would eventually be back together with Jules. Then he telephoned to ask whether he could continue to work on our garden. We were torn. We had been horrified by the violence of the attack and were concerned about the extent to which his emotional instability might affect us in the future. But we also felt that he was genuinely contrite and ashamed. In the end, we agreed to let him come back. Once or twice he came with another man, and because late summer and early autumn were warm that year they worked bare-chested, brandishing hooks and sickles to crop the dense foliage. Once, as he drank his tea, he spoke to us about the beating. At first Elizabeth encouraged him, thinking that if he could confront his shame he might become more responsible. But his face hardened and he began to talk about his \u2018enemies\u2019 on the Prairie, the people who were conniving to get rid of him. Jules\u2019s daughters, he said, were among them. We noticed shortly afterward that he had truncated his pledge to renounce drink: presumably beer, wine and stout had ceased to count. Click here for the rest of this article",

One of the eight convicted drug dealers apparently had an old BMW but we never saw it.</p> <p>It is not true that I 'did nothing'. When heroin became more apparent in the homeless population I strengthened our drugs policies, liaised (so I thought) with the police, banned drug use on site and suspected dealing, and I spoke in the local press, at meetings and at local and national conferences about the problem.</p> <p>In 1993 I did lose my job as deputy director of St Martin's Housing Trust in Norwich (the pay was \u00a317,000 a year, not \u00a320,000). So did many others: the chair resigned, and the director, four managers and around six staff were forced out.</p> <p>I was accused of allowing one person to smoke cannabis in her room. I've always denied this and there were no police charges. Subsequently I was employed as co-ordinator of the Herring House Trust in Great Yarmouth, whose trustees were aware of the Norwich situation, as were the Charity Commissioners.

      "bodyText": "I feel dreadfully misrepresented by Dr D.H. Keiller (Letters, last week) who has been manning a hate campaign against me since I submitted plans for Wintercomfort to set up a housing and rehabilitation project for homeless people in Cambridge, not far from where he lives. Police objected to this project but were over-ruled by Cambridge's planning committee. Drug dealers were never given 'carte blanche' at our day centre in Cambridge and that was not stated at my trial. Some people did come from 'miles around', but it is the only homelessness day centre for miles around. One of the eight convicted drug dealers apparently had an old BMW but we never saw it. It is not true that I 'did nothing'. When heroin became more apparent in the homeless population I strengthened our drugs policies, liaised (so I thought) with the police, banned drug use on site and suspected dealing, and I spoke in the local press, at meetings and at local and national conferences about the problem. In 1993 I did lose my job as deputy director of St Martin's Housing Trust in Norwich (the pay was \u00a317,000 a year, not \u00a320,000). So did many others: the chair resigned, and the director, four managers and around six staff were forced out. I was accused of allowing one person to smoke cannabis in her room. I've always denied this and there were no police charges. Subsequently I was employed as co-ordinator of the Herring House Trust in Great Yarmouth, whose trustees were aware of the Norwich situation, as were the Charity Commissioners. In one year, I set up a hostel and move-on housing for the homeless in Yarmouth. In 1995 I went to Cambridge. My defence team were keen for the trial to be held in Cambridge. It was the prosecutor who chose King's Lynn, which, I'm told, has the highest conviction rate of any Crown court in the country. As for confidentiality, this policy was approved by the Wintercomfort trustees. I was asked by police for the names in the day centre banned book, for drug use as well as dealing. I and others refused. We were not told keeping to confidentiality was a crime. Ruth Wyner, Prisoner EH6524 HMP Highpoint Newmarket Suffolk",

And he finished: 'Man hands on misery to man./ It deepens like a coastal shelf./ Get out as early as you can,/ And don't have any kids yourself.'</p> <p>In the trial we report today, three Brighton children were more than psychologically scarred by their parents. They died while in their custody, even though the necessary operation of the law means that it has been impossible to prove that the parents were the murderers. It is a salutary reminder that the conventional family is not always a place of love and nurture.</p> <p>However, the wisdom of the last 20 years has been to promote the sanctity of the natural family in every circumstance. The 1989 Children Act moved the emphasis away from intervention in families to working with them, to keeping children with their natural parents whenever possible. Family is best. Family is sovereign. But families can also be dark, constricting institutions, as much a source of pain as joy.</p> <p>In the case we report today, there is no doubt that Brighton social services recognised that there were severe problems. More than 230 visits were made in five years. A prosecution was attempted but blocked by the Crown Prosecution Service. They tried hard to work with the family, as the Children Act said they should. But in this case, the Act created as many problems as it solved.

      "bodyText": "Aiming to shock and startle, the poet Philip Larkin wrote memorably in 1974: 'They fuck you up, your mum and dad./ They may not mean to, but they do.' And he finished: 'Man hands on misery to man./ It deepens like a coastal shelf./ Get out as early as you can,/ And don't have any kids yourself.' In the trial we report today, three Brighton children were more than psychologically scarred by their parents. They died while in their custody, even though the necessary operation of the law means that it has been impossible to prove that the parents were the murderers. It is a salutary reminder that the conventional family is not always a place of love and nurture. However, the wisdom of the last 20 years has been to promote the sanctity of the natural family in every circumstance. The 1989 Children Act moved the emphasis away from intervention in families to working with them, to keeping children with their natural parents whenever possible. Family is best. Family is sovereign. But families can also be dark, constricting institutions, as much a source of pain as joy. In the case we report today, there is no doubt that Brighton social services recognised that there were severe problems. More than 230 visits were made in five years. A prosecution was attempted but blocked by the Crown Prosecution Service. They tried hard to work with the family, as the Children Act said they should. But in this case, the Act created as many problems as it solved. As Allan Bowman, chairman of the local Area Child Protection Committee said, sometimes the law does not reflect realities on the ground. The Children Act cannot be the last word on the issue. However much we might deplore the intervention of the state into the family, the ultimate symbol of the private in our society, we must enter into a debate about where the balance lies between privacy and child safety. It cannot be assumed that natural parents will naturally want the best, or be the best, for their child. The Government is showing some signs in recognising that over adoption, for instance, the interests of the natural parents wrongfully and sometimes harmfully take precedence over the interests of the child. Even in cases of wilful neglect and abuse, when a child has had to be taken into care, social services are unable to make long-term fostering and adoption arrangements for a child if the natural mother refuses consent. The result is that at a critical time in a young child's life, he or she is refused the security and love of potential long-term adopters, with possibly disastrous consequences. The Government wants to remedy this defect in adoption law, but the approach needs to be more generalised. We need to recognise that while long-term care institutions have had a disastrous record, it does not follow that natural families are sources of harmony and love.

The meeting is to run from 17-22 April, including Hit-ler's birthday on 20 April.</p> <p>The people who think that the Second World War was won by the wrong side are gathering in Chile's capital to plot the comeback of the neo-Nazi movement. Far-right fanatics from as far apart as Spain and Mexico and 10 South American countries have accepted invitations to the First International Ideological Meeting of the National Socialists. Outraged Jewish, human rights and youth groups are campaigning to outlaw the meeting.</p> <p>The Chilean government is exploring ways to ban the event - to accusations of discrimination from the organisers, Patria Nueva Sociedad (PNS), or New Fatherland Society. The 300-strong 'helpers' of the PNS are taking pains to present themselves as decent, thoughtful and clean-cut, to no avail.</p> <p>They complain they are misunderstood, but there is nothing ambiguous about the 'Sieg Heil' on their website. These slick modernisers eschew the jackboot and are at pains to be seen as nice guys looking for a new way in politics. But their bible is Mein Kampf and they have paid attention to Hitler's advice that the way to power is the path of legality. The leader of PNS, Alexis L\u00f3pez, 31, an entomologist and journalist, stresses that 'everything we do is legal. We will never do anything outside the law'.</p> <p>The PNS has been planning the congress for almost two years, and L\u00f3pez vows the congress will go ahead despite government disapproval. 'If we can't have it publicly, we'll have it in private.'

      "bodyText": "Fresh on the heels of Augusto Pinochet's return, Chile is bracing itself for another PR disaster when a world Nazi congress takes place in Santiago in April. The meeting is to run from 17-22 April, including Hit-ler's birthday on 20 April. The people who think that the Second World War was won by the wrong side are gathering in Chile's capital to plot the comeback of the neo-Nazi movement. Far-right fanatics from as far apart as Spain and Mexico and 10 South American countries have accepted invitations to the First International Ideological Meeting of the National Socialists. Outraged Jewish, human rights and youth groups are campaigning to outlaw the meeting. The Chilean government is exploring ways to ban the event - to accusations of discrimination from the organisers, Patria Nueva Sociedad (PNS), or New Fatherland Society. The 300-strong 'helpers' of the PNS are taking pains to present themselves as decent, thoughtful and clean-cut, to no avail. They complain they are misunderstood, but there is nothing ambiguous about the 'Sieg Heil' on their website. These slick modernisers eschew the jackboot and are at pains to be seen as nice guys looking for a new way in politics. But their bible is Mein Kampf and they have paid attention to Hitler's advice that the way to power is the path of legality. The leader of PNS, Alexis L\u00f3pez, 31, an entomologist and journalist, stresses that 'everything we do is legal. We will never do anything outside the law'. The PNS has been planning the congress for almost two years, and L\u00f3pez vows the congress will go ahead despite government disapproval. 'If we can't have it publicly, we'll have it in private.' He confirmed last week that representatives from 10 Latin American countries are coming, among them the anti-Semitic Brazilian Integralist Movement and neo-Nazi New Triumph Party of Argentina. L\u00f3pez denies that the PNS is an ultra-right movement. When asked if the PNS follows neo-Nazi principles and asked to explain the 'Sieg Heils' and Nazi insignia in the organisation's literature, he concedes it adheres to Nazi economic and labour principles, but says 'we have changed the ideology from the original.

      "body": "<p>Every spring, in the run-up to the Oscars, Vanity Fair reports on the young actors it deems most likely to become the future gods and goddesses of Hollywood. It is not always right, but because it was right about Cate Blanchett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Nicole Kidman, the industry takes its predictions very seriously. When it published its predictions for the 'class of 2000' earlier this week, the story ran in almost every national daily. But there was something very odd about the nine new faces in the accompanying photo.</p> <p>Six of them are female and three of them are male. Five have dark hair and four are blond. Two have names that suggest not entirely WASP origins. And there you have it, the sum total of distinctive features. That said, the overall effect is very pleasing. All nine faces are symmetrical and oval in shape, all nine pairs of eyes large and moist. The lips are full, the bodies are perfect. It's impossible to tell them apart.</p> <p>You could almost imagine them exchanging roles in a film without anyone noticing. But according to many people in the entertainment industries, their identikit good looks are just not a problem. They are what everyone is looking for these days. Nothing sells better than a perfectly symmetrical 17-year-old blank slate.</p> <p>Unless it's a 16-year-old blank slate. According to Sandra Halliday, news editor of the Internet fashion site WGSM, it is important to keep one's sense of proportion about this. There are sound practical reasons for using young models. Cameras are kinder to slips of girls. Slips of girls cut better figures on the catwalk. Ours is hardly the only culture to glorify youth, she says.</p> <p>In her book, Survival of the Prettiest , Harvard psychologist Nancy Etcoff cites research suggesting that it pays to be beautiful at any age: the closer you are to the classical ideal, the more likely you are to get jobs, salary rises and promotions. She believes that our standards of beauty are to a large degree genetically determined. 'We are born with lookism programmed into us,' she says. There are studies showing that babies as young as three months old respond more favourably to a classically beautiful face that they do to a classically plain one. Long before we ever see our first issue of Vogue , she says, we all have 'biological radar for healthy, fertile bodies'. If this is so, it would be wrong to blame the showbiz world for making our wildest dreams come true.</p> <p>But in so doing, has it perhaps changed our idea of what is normal or possible? One of Etcoff's pet theories is that human beauty is based on 'facial averageness'. 'Since the average of a population is likely to reflect the optimal design of physical traits, evolution has given us brains wired to calculate mean averages and prefer them.'</p> <p>Those who first proposed this theory likened it to a 'face-averaging device', and suggested that it might work like 'composite portraiture'. 'It collects impressions of faces and turns them into composites that become our standards of attractiveness.'</p> <p>The standards you end up with, she suggests, depend very much on the sum total of faces you see. Thus, in an age when the Chelsea Set only ever saw the other members of the Chelsea Set, the standards of beauty would have been rather narrow and perhaps a little racist. But now, with so many non-white ethnic groups gaining prominence in the Western world, the pool of facial data is much larger and beauty standards have become broader. You see a shift away from Caucasian norms. We are moving, she says, to an 'internal average where Asian, African and Hispanic features are helping to recalibrate norms and re-envision beauty'.</p> <p>That view is far too optimistic, according to Halliday. She still sees a great deal of 'covert racism' right across the media. Naomi Campbell has done well, she thinks, because her beauty is closer to the Western norm than it is to the African norm. It's the same for Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek, she says, and for almost all of the handsome new generation of not-Caucasian Hollywood men. You cannot expect to do well, she thinks, unless you can appeal to white consumers.</p> <p>This may explain why our new beauty standards are such halting, timid recalibrations of the old ones.</p> <p>The pool of facial images coming to us from the media is not just disproportionately good-looking, but disproportionately youthful. During the 15 years that Annie Shepherd has worked as a New York music video producer, she's seen the ages of the stars go down so far and so fast that people are talking about themselves as has-beens by the time they've turned 18. The internal norms of the music industry, she says, have never been more rigid. 'Even if you're young and talented, they won't sign you if you're ugly.' She is worried about the effect this is having on her own pre-teen daughter's self-image.</p> <p>But at least her daughter is drawing her standards of beauty from real people. As technology improves, real beauties are going to have to compete with cyberbabes. It's happening as we speak: Lara Croft has already appeared on the covers of The Face and Loaded . Games magazines routinely feature a 'virtual babe'. This allows ideal types to exert an even more powerful influence.</p> <p>Last year, psychologist Vic tor Johnson surveyed 10,000 men about their criteria for an ideal woman. He then processed their views to come up with the ideal cyberbabe. When the Daily Mirror ran a picture of the final product, it asked readers to send in photos of real people who resembled her. There followed a reader's poll to find out which of the top five closest matches was the most beautiful. It turned out to be an 18-year-old girl from Warrington. When the Daily Mirror ran her winning picture, the headline was, 'Face it - I'm Perfect'.</p> <p>And let's face it. She was. But she was also very embarrassed by the whole thing. It is right to query media trends, as Halliday puts it, and it is wrong to assume that they have the same terrible effect on everyone.

      "bodyText": "Every spring, in the run-up to the Oscars, Vanity Fair reports on the young actors it deems most likely to become the future gods and goddesses of Hollywood. It is not always right, but because it was right about Cate Blanchett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Nicole Kidman, the industry takes its predictions very seriously. When it published its predictions for the 'class of 2000' earlier this week, the story ran in almost every national daily. But there was something very odd about the nine new faces in the accompanying photo. Six of them are female and three of them are male. Five have dark hair and four are blond. Two have names that suggest not entirely WASP origins. And there you have it, the sum total of distinctive features. That said, the overall effect is very pleasing. All nine faces are symmetrical and oval in shape, all nine pairs of eyes large and moist. The lips are full, the bodies are perfect. It's impossible to tell them apart. You could almost imagine them exchanging roles in a film without anyone noticing. But according to many people in the entertainment industries, their identikit good looks are just not a problem. They are what everyone is looking for these days. Nothing sells better than a perfectly symmetrical 17-year-old blank slate. Unless it's a 16-year-old blank slate. According to Sandra Halliday, news editor of the Internet fashion site WGSM, it is important to keep one's sense of proportion about this. There are sound practical reasons for using young models. Cameras are kinder to slips of girls. Slips of girls cut better figures on the catwalk. Ours is hardly the only culture to glorify youth, she says. In her book, Survival of the Prettiest , Harvard psychologist Nancy Etcoff cites research suggesting that it pays to be beautiful at any age: the closer you are to the classical ideal, the more likely you are to get jobs, salary rises and promotions. She believes that our standards of beauty are to a large degree genetically determined. 'We are born with lookism programmed into us,' she says. There are studies showing that babies as young as three months old respond more favourably to a classically beautiful face that they do to a classically plain one. Long before we ever see our first issue of Vogue , she says, we all have 'biological radar for healthy, fertile bodies'. If this is so, it would be wrong to blame the showbiz world for making our wildest dreams come true. But in so doing, has it perhaps changed our idea of what is normal or possible? One of Etcoff's pet theories is that human beauty is based on 'facial averageness'. 'Since the average of a population is likely to reflect the optimal design of physical traits, evolution has given us brains wired to calculate mean averages and prefer them.' Those who first proposed this theory likened it to a 'face-averaging device', and suggested that it might work like 'composite portraiture'. 'It collects impressions of faces and turns them into composites that become our standards of attractiveness.' The standards you end up with, she suggests, depend very much on the sum total of faces you see. Thus, in an age when the Chelsea Set only ever saw the other members of the Chelsea Set, the standards of beauty would have been rather narrow and perhaps a little racist. But now, with so many non-white ethnic groups gaining prominence in the Western world, the pool of facial data is much larger and beauty standards have become broader. You see a shift away from Caucasian norms. We are moving, she says, to an 'internal average where Asian, African and Hispanic features are helping to recalibrate norms and re-envision beauty'. That view is far too optimistic, according to Halliday. She still sees a great deal of 'covert racism' right across the media. Naomi Campbell has done well, she thinks, because her beauty is closer to the Western norm than it is to the African norm. It's the same for Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek, she says, and for almost all of the handsome new generation of not-Caucasian Hollywood men. You cannot expect to do well, she thinks, unless you can appeal to white consumers. This may explain why our new beauty standards are such halting, timid recalibrations of the old ones. The pool of facial images coming to us from the media is not just disproportionately good-looking, but disproportionately youthful. During the 15 years that Annie Shepherd has worked as a New York music video producer, she's seen the ages of the stars go down so far and so fast that people are talking about themselves as has-beens by the time they've turned 18. The internal norms of the music industry, she says, have never been more rigid. 'Even if you're young and talented, they won't sign you if you're ugly.'

I voted Labour when the local party was run by brain-dead Trots, and in the Callaghan days when the party was run by tired old geezers who made Tony Blair look like Watt Tyler's radical kid brother. I couldn't vote Tory because - well I just couldn't - and no other party has ever got nearer to where I wanted to be than Labour, in any of its guises.</p> <p>Having come through all that, suddenly I find myself in danger of not voting at an election.

I can still remember what the GLC was like under the late Horace Cutler, the clownish Bernard Matthews of local politics. And I remember the relief when Labour got in and Livingstone executed the dodgy coup against Andrew Macintosh on his first day in the chamber after the election. Yes, I thought Fare's Fare was wonderful; no, I had no problem with the GLC raising a supplementary rate when the money started running out; no, I could never get too upset about the comparatively small amounts of money handed to gay and ethnic groups. And, almost regardless of Livingstone's policies, under his rule London felt like a place of its own, with a special identity.</p> <p>Then, in 1991, I interviewed Livingstone for the London Evening Standard . I thought he was going a tad far when he predicted with relish that with the coming of the true Brussels spirit, national government would wither and die, and all power would devolve to the EC and the regions - but even that would suggest to me that he'd be safer working at local rather than national level.</p> <p>The one thing that almost certainly will stop me voting for him is that he was happy to admit that when he got into Parliament just four years earlier he had given up on London as his specialist subject. 'I did not come here as Mr London I came here to do something else,' he told me.</p> <p>The something else was to develop some new sort of economic model for Britain. Or Europe. Or the World.

Here was the man once proclaimed as London's saviour telling me London wasn't his business any more. London was dying on its feet.

And without a GLC we needed more than ever an MP who would stand up for the capital in the Commons.</p> <p>Other Labour MPs were doing it, after all. Tony Banks quickly became a professional Londoner, almost on the level of Fred Housego or the Pearly Kings: if something nasty was happening in London then Banks was at the microphone complaining.

Ken was now an economist, and it wasn't until the mayoralty became a paying proposition that he resurfaced as a born-again Londoner.</p> <p>But the alternative? Frank Dobson? I'm not sure I can bring myself to vote for him either. Don't get me wrong - I'm just the sort of mealy-mouthed Blair-supporting anal retentive that Ken's people hate. But I recognise that the only value of having a Mayor with such truncated powers is that he or she can give a personality to the city in the way American mayors do. The way Ken Livingstone did, come to that. We need a mayor of sufficient charisma that the microphone and the camera will always be in his face. And Frank isn't that man.</p> <p>It's not that I mind him being Blair's poodle: even the most radical elected official is a party's poodle if he wants to keep the party whip.

It wouldn't occur to me not to; one of the first political saws I learned from my father was that if you don't vote you give up the right to complain. In every election, except for one in the Eighties where I recklessly gave one of my three local council votes to the Green Party, I have voted Labour. I voted Labour when the local party was run by brain-dead Trots, and in the Callaghan days when the party was run by tired old geezers who made Tony Blair look like Watt Tyler's radical kid brother. I couldn't vote Tory because - well I just couldn't - and no other party has ever got nearer to where I wanted to be than Labour, in any of its guises. Having come through all that, suddenly I find myself in danger of not voting at an election. As a Labour member I should, of course, have voted in the Ken v Frank fight at party level but couldn't bring myself to put my mark against either name.

      "body": "<p>Ken Livingstone is the Rasputin of British politics - except that they got Rasputin in the end. They've bludgeoned him. They've shot him. They've stabbed him. They've poisoned him. They've tried chucking him into the river. Damn it, swears Tony Blair, as the newt-fancier just bubbles up to the surface, smiling that infuriatingly smug salamander smile.</p> <p>The moment Livingstone unfurled himself as an independent, the big howitzers of the Cabinet and the popguns of the backbenches swivelled in the direction of the Cricklewood chancer. Were you and I on the receiving end of such a brutal barrage, we would be lying in a darkened room with a bag of ice on our foreheads. From Number 10 downwards, they've been thumbing Campbell's Thesaurus of Abuse. He's a liar, a traitor, an egotist. Should the people be so recklessly stupid as to elect him, he will be a more cataclysmic disaster for the capital city than the Plague of London rolled into the Great Fire.</p> <p>Tony Blair and his cohorts may turn out to be right that he will be a bad mayor. Frank Dobson is not wrong when he says of Livingstone: 'Those who know him best trust him least.' Livingstone simply doesn't care. He can afford not to. It isn't honest Frank who commands the massive poll ratings and the audiences that explode in cheers before he has even opened his mouth. The punters don't mind that he lied. He's a politician, isn't he? So he's treacherous. He's a politician, isn't he? So he's an egotist. He's a politician, isn't he?</p> <p>The lesson for New Labour - a lesson that should have been learnt many months ago - is that these attacks, even when grounded in the truth, have no traction against Livingstone. Worse, it's counter-destructive. He thrives when the battalions mass against him. He gorges and grows fat on their abuse. In the Eighties, he turned himself into the Cockney Rebel by confronting the judges and the Tories. Now his popularity with the voters draws on his unpopularity with Downing Street and the New Labour machine. Livingstone is a mutant form of politician. Like the coprophagous beetle, the more crap that is thrown in his direction, the stronger he becomes.</p> <p>The man himself claims to expect his lead to shrivel during the course of the campaign. 'Of course I can be beaten,' Livingstone tells me. 'I could do something stupid. Frank could hire a contract killer.' He shouldn't put ideas like that into Downing Street's head. Or maybe he should. Given how atrociously they've fouled this up, a Millbank contracted killer would be certain to blow away Dobbo.</p> <p>People in a rage never make good decisions. This has been Tony Blair's problem with Livingstone from the very beginning. No one in the inner courts of New Labour has been able to clear the red mist from their eyes for long enough to think coolly about how to deal with him. New Labour has been utterly confounded by Newt Labour, a label on which I believe I own the copyright but am delighted to see others taking up.</p> <p>New Labour's thrashing incomprehension of Livingstone's popularity reminds me of nothing so much as the Tories' stunned bewilderment when first faced with the appeal of New Labour. This is a lovely irony. Before the last election, John Major simply couldn't fathom Tony Blair. Surely, Major reasoned, the people would see through this unprincipled opportunist who once sub scribed to so many things that made Labour unelectable. Equally, Tony Blair cannot handle the popularity of Livingstone. Surely, he says to himself, the people will see through this unprincipled opportunist who was once responsible for so much that made Labour unelectable.</p> <p>To grasp Livingstone's appeal, Tony Blair only has to look in the mirror to see much of the answer staring him in the face. Just as he reinvented the party as New Labour, so Livingstone has reconfigured himself from Red Ken into Cuddly Ken. Just as New Labour has accommodated itself to capitalism, so has Newt Livingstone. I watched him last week stroke an audience of City pinstripes to a standing ovation. Just as Blair won his landslide by inviting the national electorate to stuff the sleazy Tories, so Livingstone campaigns for a landslide by offering himself as the device to stiff the control-freakists of New Labour.</p> <p>Blair represented change - but nothing too disturbingly radical. Livingstone says he is different - but not dangerously so. Just as Blair assembled an extraordinary coalition of support, spanning the classes and the ages, so has Livingstone. Following his campaign over the last seven days - you can read my report elsewhere in the paper - I found him being embraced with equal enthusiasm by students at the LSE and slickers from the Square Mile.</p> <p>This rainbow of support can be sustained until election day. It can't be expected to last forever after. Tony Blair's vote at the last general election was wide but shallow. The longer he has been in office, the trickier he has found the balancing act required to keep content all the constituent parts of his coalition. Livingstone, the candidate, is the beneficiary of the mid-term antagonism towards the Government. Livingstone, the mayor, will be a victim of the same process himself.</p> <p>Ken's bound to be a disappointment to some people, probably a huge number of them, when they discover that the Tube does not miraculously start to move faster and it doesn't stop raining on the bus queue the day after they've voted for him. One of two things is likely to happen. The Prime Minister will be proved right. Off will be ripped the rubber mask of cheeky chappie Ken, and all those merchant bankers who voted for him just because he's a bit of a card will have a shock when he reveals himself to be an unreconstructed hard Leftist. Alternatively, Mayor Livingstone will be the acme of commonsense he now claims to be. This will come as a bitter betrayal to his fellow travellers when they discover he is not the revolutionary instrument for creating a workers' paradise on Earth in the London Commune as a first step towards supplanting the Blair Government with the People's Socialist Republic of Britain.</p> <p>The implausibility of Livingstone satisfying every component of his coalition is not an argument anyone's hearing - because it's been drowned out by the counterproductive gnashing and howling that he's a lying shyster. I offer this suggestion to Tony Blair. Turn down the volume. A light touch with Labour and union activists who help Livingstone would also be well-judged.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone is the Rasputin of British politics - except that they got Rasputin in the end. They've bludgeoned him. They've shot him. They've stabbed him. They've poisoned him. They've tried chucking him into the river. Damn it, swears Tony Blair, as the newt-fancier just bubbles up to the surface, smiling that infuriatingly smug salamander smile. The moment Livingstone unfurled himself as an independent, the big howitzers of the Cabinet and the popguns of the backbenches swivelled in the direction of the Cricklewood chancer. Were you and I on the receiving end of such a brutal barrage, we would be lying in a darkened room with a bag of ice on our foreheads. From Number 10 downwards, they've been thumbing Campbell's Thesaurus of Abuse. He's a liar, a traitor, an egotist. Should the people be so recklessly stupid as to elect him, he will be a more cataclysmic disaster for the capital city than the Plague of London rolled into the Great Fire. Tony Blair and his cohorts may turn out to be right that he will be a bad mayor. Frank Dobson is not wrong when he says of Livingstone: 'Those who know him best trust him least.' Livingstone simply doesn't care. He can afford not to. It isn't honest Frank who commands the massive poll ratings and the audiences that explode in cheers before he has even opened his mouth. The punters don't mind that he lied. He's a politician, isn't he? So he's treacherous. He's a politician, isn't he? So he's an egotist. He's a politician, isn't he? The lesson for New Labour - a lesson that should have been learnt many months ago - is that these attacks, even when grounded in the truth, have no traction against Livingstone. Worse, it's counter-destructive. He thrives when the battalions mass against him. He gorges and grows fat on their abuse. In the Eighties, he turned himself into the Cockney Rebel by confronting the judges and the Tories. Now his popularity with the voters draws on his unpopularity with Downing Street and the New Labour machine. Livingstone is a mutant form of politician. Like the coprophagous beetle, the more crap that is thrown in his direction, the stronger he becomes. The man himself claims to expect his lead to shrivel during the course of the campaign. 'Of course I can be beaten,' Livingstone tells me. 'I could do something stupid. Frank could hire a contract killer.' He shouldn't put ideas like that into Downing Street's head. Or maybe he should. Given how atrociously they've fouled this up, a Millbank contracted killer would be certain to blow away Dobbo. People in a rage never make good decisions. This has been Tony Blair's problem with Livingstone from the very beginning. No one in the inner courts of New Labour has been able to clear the red mist from their eyes for long enough to think coolly about how to deal with him. New Labour has been utterly confounded by Newt Labour, a label on which I believe I own the copyright but am delighted to see others taking up. New Labour's thrashing incomprehension of Livingstone's popularity reminds me of nothing so much as the Tories' stunned bewilderment when first faced with the appeal of New Labour. This is a lovely irony. Before the last election, John Major simply couldn't fathom Tony Blair. Surely, Major reasoned, the people would see through this unprincipled opportunist who once sub scribed to so many things that made Labour unelectable. Equally, Tony Blair cannot handle the popularity of Livingstone. Surely, he says to himself, the people will see through this unprincipled opportunist who was once responsible for so much that made Labour unelectable. To grasp Livingstone's appeal, Tony Blair only has to look in the mirror to see much of the answer staring him in the face. Just as he reinvented the party as New Labour, so Livingstone has reconfigured himself from Red Ken into Cuddly Ken. Just as New Labour has accommodated itself to capitalism, so has Newt Livingstone. I watched him last week stroke an audience of City pinstripes to a standing ovation. Just as Blair won his landslide by inviting the national electorate to stuff the sleazy Tories, so Livingstone campaigns for a landslide by offering himself as the device to stiff the control-freakists of New Labour. Blair represented change - but nothing too disturbingly radical. Livingstone says he is different - but not dangerously so. Just as Blair assembled an extraordinary coalition of support, spanning the classes and the ages, so has Livingstone. Following his campaign over the last seven days - you can read my report elsewhere in the paper - I found him being embraced with equal enthusiasm by students at the LSE and slickers from the Square Mile. This rainbow of support can be sustained until election day. It can't be expected to last forever after. Tony Blair's vote at the last general election was wide but shallow. The longer he has been in office, the trickier he has found the balancing act required to keep content all the constituent parts of his coalition. Livingstone, the candidate, is the beneficiary of the mid-term antagonism towards the Government. Livingstone, the mayor, will be a victim of the same process himself. Ken's bound to be a disappointment to some people, probably a huge number of them, when they discover that the Tube does not miraculously start to move faster and it doesn't stop raining on the bus queue the day after they've voted for him. One of two things is likely to happen. The Prime Minister will be proved right. Off will be ripped the rubber mask of cheeky chappie Ken, and all those merchant bankers who voted for him just because he's a bit of a card will have a shock when he reveals himself to be an unreconstructed hard Leftist. Alternatively, Mayor Livingstone will be the acme of commonsense he now claims to be. This will come as a bitter betrayal to his fellow travellers when they discover he is not the revolutionary instrument for creating a workers' paradise on Earth in the London Commune as a first step towards supplanting the Blair Government with the People's Socialist Republic of Britain. The implausibility of Livingstone satisfying every component of his coalition is not an argument anyone's hearing - because it's been drowned out by the counterproductive gnashing and howling that he's a lying shyster. I offer this suggestion to Tony Blair. Turn down the volume. A light touch with Labour and union activists who help Livingstone would also be well-judged. A wave of mass expulsions will make a terrible tear in the Prime Minister's Big Tent. The purge - rather than what Livingstone stands for and what he would do - will be the story of the campaign. Best, too, to cease suggesting that the Government will use the London Assembly to castrate him. The more powerless they suggest Mayor Livingstone will be, the more voters will regard him as a fun-filled, risk-free ride. A smarter way to contest with Livingstone is to start taking him seriously. Invite him to join a searching argument about what he really believes in. Names will never hurt him. Tony Blair might instead try to kill Ken with kindness.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Next to your rent or mortgage, your food bill may well be your largest monthly expense. But unlike the price you pay for your accommodation, it is not a fixed cost. So if you want to find some room for manoeuvre in your budget, the grocery bill could well be the place to start. </p> <p>But is it possible to pare down your supermarket bill without serious self-sacrifice? Certainly: changing the way you shop could enable you to maintain the quality of your groceries, but at the same time save more than \u00a3100 a month. </p> <p>As a population, we have stepped up the proportion of our income we spend on food. According to research from Mintel, food retailers did better in the five years from 1993 in terms of rising sales than the retail sector as a whole, with sales increasing by 23 per cent over the period. </p> <p>'This implies that people are spending a greater proportion of their income on food,' the report's authors said. However they acknowledged that the fact that larger food retailers were widening their range of products beyond traditional core areas was an influential factor. </p> <p>Rather than shopping at different shops and comparing prices, many people now restrict their shopping to one supermarket. And that supermarket has changed. Its product ranges has broadened way beyond groceries and household items: larger outlets now stock books, magazines, CDs, clothes, flowers, videos. Some have dry-cleaning facilities and banking services. 'Essentially, they've become the traditional high street under one roof,' the Consumers' Association points out in a report on supermarkets. </p> <p>While we may like the choice and service offered, it is now so time consuming simply to push a trolley round the numerous aisles of a large supermarket that shoppers are reluctant to make any additional trips elsewhere. And publicity from the large chains aims to give the impression of low prices. </p> <p>Asda says that thanks to its 'Rollback' price-cutting campaign, its price for an average basket of goods has come down by 18 per cent over the past year. But the jury is still out on whether the large chains do actually offer value for money. </p> <p>The UK Competition Commission is conducting a monopoly inquiry into the supermarket industry, and has said it will consider measures as drastic as forcing companies to sell stores if it discovered competition problems. The hearings are taking place this month. </p> <p>However, many basic products are now offered at far lower prices by discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto. These are supermarket chains, often with outlets Europe-wide or even worldwide, which claim to discount prices. They can do so, they say, because of economies of scale and their bare-bones approach to the retail business.

      "bodyText": "Next to your rent or mortgage, your food bill may well be your largest monthly expense. But unlike the price you pay for your accommodation, it is not a fixed cost. So if you want to find some room for manoeuvre in your budget, the grocery bill could well be the place to start. But is it possible to pare down your supermarket bill without serious self-sacrifice? Certainly: changing the way you shop could enable you to maintain the quality of your groceries, but at the same time save more than \u00a3100 a month. As a population, we have stepped up the proportion of our income we spend on food. According to research from Mintel, food retailers did better in the five years from 1993 in terms of rising sales than the retail sector as a whole, with sales increasing by 23 per cent over the period. 'This implies that people are spending a greater proportion of their income on food,' the report's authors said. However they acknowledged that the fact that larger food retailers were widening their range of products beyond traditional core areas was an influential factor. Rather than shopping at different shops and comparing prices, many people now restrict their shopping to one supermarket. And that supermarket has changed. Its product ranges has broadened way beyond groceries and household items: larger outlets now stock books, magazines, CDs, clothes, flowers, videos. Some have dry-cleaning facilities and banking services. 'Essentially, they've become the traditional high street under one roof,' the Consumers' Association points out in a report on supermarkets. While we may like the choice and service offered, it is now so time consuming simply to push a trolley round the numerous aisles of a large supermarket that shoppers are reluctant to make any additional trips elsewhere. And publicity from the large chains aims to give the impression of low prices. Asda says that thanks to its 'Rollback' price-cutting campaign, its price for an average basket of goods has come down by 18 per cent over the past year. But the jury is still out on whether the large chains do actually offer value for money. The UK Competition Commission is conducting a monopoly inquiry into the supermarket industry, and has said it will consider measures as drastic as forcing companies to sell stores if it discovered competition problems. The hearings are taking place this month. However, many basic products are now offered at far lower prices by discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto. These are supermarket chains, often with outlets Europe-wide or even worldwide, which claim to discount prices. They can do so, they say, because of economies of scale and their bare-bones approach to the retail business. According to Consumers' Association research, prices for own-brand products at Aldi and Netto were nearly half the price of own-brand products in the most expensive main supermarket chain it looked at - Waitrose. A spokesman for Aldi says the large chains have grown further away from what grocery shopping used to be about. 'They've made the shopping experience very complicated,' he says.

      "body": "<p>Victorian landscape watercolours, once lucky to find refuge on the dusty walls of vicarages, are likely to become hot property at two major sales this week. </p> <p>The biggest private collection of them to come under the hammer for more than 20 years will be sold at Christie's next month, with 141 lots expected to be snapped up for between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a3800,000. </p> <p>And the Spink-Leger gallery also launches a selling exhibition this week that hails lesser-known early 19th century watercolourists as pioneers of the Romantic revival and forerunners of Impressionism. </p> <p>Victorian pictures led the art market out of the slump of the late eighties. Prices fell at the start of the next decade but reached a new peak in 1994. They did falter again, but have been rising steadily for the past four years. </p> <p>In recent years the best of the watercolour landscapes have been disappearing rapidly into museums and private collections. Quality works are now in short supply and dealers and auctioneers have responded by casting their net wider. </p> <p>The list of blue-chip names has now swelled from a handful - Turner, Constable, Cozens, Girtin, Cotman - to include lesser-knowns such as Cox, Hunt, De Wint, Linnell, and John Varley. </p> <p>In the next few weeks, London's starved, but increasingly educated and discriminating, market for Victorian landscape watercolours is likely to put its money on two lesser- knowns artists - Cornelius Varley, 1781-1873 (at Spink-Leger) and James Watts, 1853-1930 (at Christie's). </p> <p>Price tags and auction estimates indicate pictures by both artists could be bought for as little as \u00a32,500, but if you'd hesitate to part with even the price of a second-hand family saloon for a painting, at least view what is on offer in order to get an inkling of what has lit up the trained eyes of dealers and collectors. </p> <p>It has taken Lowell Libson of Spink-Leger six years to put together his selling exhibition, The Feeling Eye: The 'New' Landscape in Britain 1800-1830 . Libson began making waves in the Victorian watercolours market when he bid a whopping \u00a351,000 at Sotheby's, way above the \u00a312,000-\u00a318,000 estimate, for William Hunt's watercolour The Interior of a Barn, a price record for the artists that still stands. </p> <p>That was three years ago, after Spink and Leger had merged and their owner, Christie's, had entrusted Libson with a huge buying kitty. He bought the Hunt for stock, such is his confidence in his own eye. </p> <p>In Hunt's early 19th century landscapes, Libson detects a breaking away from the artificial 'picturesque' style with its theatrical scenery, tasteful classical ruins and occasional nymph or shepherd. The artists in his exhibition, notably a group that congregated at the feet of John Varley, went into the open air with their paints and pencils and confronted nature in the raw - in much the way of the Lake poets. </p> <p>'These landscapes struck me as personal, exciting and rewarding,' says Libson. 'They have hitherto occupied a critical backwater, dismissed as parochial, but in my opinion British landscape, especially of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, is the greatest contribution the British have made to Western painting.

      "bodyText": "Victorian landscape watercolours, once lucky to find refuge on the dusty walls of vicarages, are likely to become hot property at two major sales this week. The biggest private collection of them to come under the hammer for more than 20 years will be sold at Christie's next month, with 141 lots expected to be snapped up for between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a3800,000. And the Spink-Leger gallery also launches a selling exhibition this week that hails lesser-known early 19th century watercolourists as pioneers of the Romantic revival and forerunners of Impressionism. Victorian pictures led the art market out of the slump of the late eighties. Prices fell at the start of the next decade but reached a new peak in 1994. They did falter again, but have been rising steadily for the past four years. In recent years the best of the watercolour landscapes have been disappearing rapidly into museums and private collections. Quality works are now in short supply and dealers and auctioneers have responded by casting their net wider. The list of blue-chip names has now swelled from a handful - Turner, Constable, Cozens, Girtin, Cotman - to include lesser-knowns such as Cox, Hunt, De Wint, Linnell, and John Varley. In the next few weeks, London's starved, but increasingly educated and discriminating, market for Victorian landscape watercolours is likely to put its money on two lesser- knowns artists - Cornelius Varley, 1781-1873 (at Spink-Leger) and James Watts, 1853-1930 (at Christie's). Price tags and auction estimates indicate pictures by both artists could be bought for as little as \u00a32,500, but if you'd hesitate to part with even the price of a second-hand family saloon for a painting, at least view what is on offer in order to get an inkling of what has lit up the trained eyes of dealers and collectors. It has taken Lowell Libson of Spink-Leger six years to put together his selling exhibition, The Feeling Eye: The 'New' Landscape in Britain 1800-1830 . Libson began making waves in the Victorian watercolours market when he bid a whopping \u00a351,000 at Sotheby's, way above the \u00a312,000-\u00a318,000 estimate, for William Hunt's watercolour The Interior of a Barn, a price record for the artists that still stands. That was three years ago, after Spink and Leger had merged and their owner, Christie's, had entrusted Libson with a huge buying kitty. He bought the Hunt for stock, such is his confidence in his own eye. In Hunt's early 19th century landscapes, Libson detects a breaking away from the artificial 'picturesque' style with its theatrical scenery, tasteful classical ruins and occasional nymph or shepherd. The artists in his exhibition, notably a group that congregated at the feet of John Varley, went into the open air with their paints and pencils and confronted nature in the raw - in much the way of the Lake poets. 'These landscapes struck me as personal, exciting and rewarding,' says Libson. 'They have hitherto occupied a critical backwater, dismissed as parochial, but in my opinion British landscape, especially of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, is the greatest contribution the British have made to Western painting. My aim was to produce a strong show to combat the prejudice that British art of the period is secondary to European.' He leads me towards a pencil sketch of 1803 by the lesser-known Cornelius Varley, who studied under his elder brother, John. It is of the weir at Machynlleth, Wales, priced at \u00a37,000. Then there is Cornelius's watercolour of a cottage near Brampton, Huntingdon - price \u00a318,000. 'See how he's got to grips with his subject,' Libson says. 'He's understood its dynamics, done all he wants to do with it.' He props John Varley's spirited and technically accomplished watercolour of Conway Castle in front of me (\u00a336,000). John taught a generation of maturing artists between 1803 and 1810, including Linnell, Hunt and Turner of Oxford. 'Almost spiritual,' Libson says of it. And then I bridle at Thomas Tudor's meringue-like clouds at sunset, painted in 1810 (\u00a32,400).'Clouds were a nineteenth-century preoccupation,' Libson says. More cloud paintings appear before me, by Cox, Linnell, James Ward and Cornelius Varley. All are Romantic, Impressionistic. The star turn of David Fuller's collection of Victorian landscape watercolours at Christie's is the only known group of work by the late Victorian James Watts (1853-1930).

He rescued Watts from obscurity, having briefed dealers and country auctioneers in Wales and the North of England to be on the lookout for his work. The Watts watercolours carry estimates of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a36,000, but prices could be driven up. Ominous note for would-be investors: Fuller is selling his Victorian collection in order to invest in the work of living artists. 'They're my heroes,' he says.

His dilemma is whether he should pay off his debts or take out another loan and buy a decent car. </p> <p>He studied opto-electronics and laser systems at Hull University and until recently was working on his MPhil, researching next-generation Internet technology, involving optical fibres. His course, while officially at Loughborough University, was done as a work placement. He has now been taken on full time. </p> <p>Like many, Lovelady has a student loan to repay, and now that he has a reasonable salary he is trying to get his finances straight. He is a member of a final salary pension scheme at work, to which he contributes 5 per cent. He is also saving through the company's share save scheme. He pays 3 per cent of his earnings to this and his employer tops it up with another 1.5 per cent. </p> <p>He is living in rented accommodation,which costs \u00a3370 a month. </p> <p>He doesn't see himself getting on to the property ladder for a few years - he is hoping to move around with his job at home and abroad. By that time he believes his salary will have risen and the 'stupid house prices at the moment will level off'. </p> <p>Apart from rent, other regular bills include \u00a360 a month for mobile phone and car insurance and \u00a380 for his student loan. This leaves him with around \u00a3800 a month. He received a small inheritance on the death of his father last year, which enabled him to pay off a \u00a33,000 credit card debt, but he still has \u00a34,000 and is thinking of borrowing another \u00a35,000 to enable him to buy a car for \u00a39,000. </p> <p>'I need a car to drive to work, and this money would enable me to buy a decent V reg. I cannot buy a small car because of my height [6ft 3in] and I do not really want to get a cheaper one. I did this three years ago and it ended costing me \u00a33,000 in one-off payments. </p> <p>'My question is this: am I being incredibly stupid getting into more debt rather than paying off my student loan?' </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Charles Levett-Scrivener</strong></p> <p> The rate of interest on a student loan is equal to the retail price index, so the loan will be charged at 2.1 per cent until 31 August. These loans can be repaid over 60 or 80 months, depending on how many have been arranged. </p> <p>It is not possible to borrow for any consumer purpose at this rate of interest. </p> <p>So Mike should take as long as the rules allow to to repay his student loan. Any spare funds he has available as a result can either be put towards buying his new car or, for example, saving for a deposit for whenever he does decide to purchase a home. </p> <p>When arranging a consumer loan, the only way to get the best deal is to shop around. Sometimes car dealerships offer good rates, but these are possibly linked to above-average car prices. Affinity groups are another possibility. For example, Mike's old university may provide a facility for graduates to obtain personal loans at a reduced rate. Some employers offer such facilities, or Mike may be able to find a competitive deal on the Internet. </p> <p>I believe Mike is probably wise to wait before buying a home. It is best for buyers to have reasonably clear career prospects for two years ahead before embarking on house purchase. This will also give him a chance to save. It is important for prospective homebuyers to have a deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price and to be able to pay general expenses such as stamp duty. The better loan deals are usually available to borrowers with a deposit. All first-time buyers should arrange their loan on a 'repayment' basis. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for independent financial adviser Towry Law </p> <p><strong> Adviser 2: Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>Mike's decision to retain the student loan for now seems reasonable, as it is comparatively cheap. </p> <p>After his unfortunate experience with his existing car, buying one still under warranty would make good sense. The nearly-new car market is in the doldrums, and there are good deals about. </p> <p>The funding of this vehicle will depend on its cost and what finance arrangements are offered. Some dealers offer nil-interest finance. It would be best to shop around. </p> <p>If favourable terms are not available from the car dealer, Mike should consider the plentiful loan offers around. Rather than plump for his credit card, which would be convenient but expensive, he should speak to a selection of banks and building societies to find the cheapest personal loan. </p> <p>Bear in mind any penalties for repaying this type of loan early. </p> <p>Insurance may be offered with the loan to cover redundancy and sickness or death. People often feel such cover is expensive and unnecessary, but it should not be ignored, especially if salary continuance in the event of disability is not provided by Mike's employer. </p> <p>In selecting a car, he should consider not only the price, but running costs such as fuel, insurance and servicing. Such aspects are often overlooked in the euphoria of acquiring a new vehicle. </p> <p>Any surplus funds could be held in a cash Isa. The balance built up could become a house deposit when Mike is clearer on where his career is going. </p> <p>\u0095 Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

Affinity groups are another possibility. For example, Mike's old university may provide a facility for graduates to obtain personal loans at a reduced rate. Some employers offer such facilities, or Mike may be able to find a competitive deal on the Internet. I believe Mike is probably wise to wait before buying a home. It is best for buyers to have reasonably clear career prospects for two years ahead before embarking on house purchase. This will also give him a chance to save. It is important for prospective homebuyers to have a deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price and to be able to pay general expenses such as stamp duty. The better loan deals are usually available to borrowers with a deposit. All first-time buyers should arrange their loan on a 'repayment' basis. \u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for independent financial adviser Towry Law Adviser 2: Sharon Linnard Mike's decision to retain the student loan for now seems reasonable, as it is comparatively cheap. After his unfortunate experience with his existing car, buying one still under warranty would make good sense. The nearly-new car market is in the doldrums, and there are good deals about. The funding of this vehicle will depend on its cost and what finance arrangements are offered. Some dealers offer nil-interest finance. It would be best to shop around. If favourable terms are not available from the car dealer, Mike should consider the plentiful loan offers around. Rather than plump for his credit card, which would be convenient but expensive, he should speak to a selection of banks and building societies to find the cheapest personal loan. Bear in mind any penalties for repaying this type of loan early. Insurance may be offered with the loan to cover redundancy and sickness or death. People often feel such cover is expensive and unnecessary, but it should not be ignored, especially if salary continuance in the event of disability is not provided by Mike's employer. In selecting a car, he should consider not only the price, but running costs such as fuel, insurance and servicing. Such aspects are often overlooked in the euphoria of acquiring a new vehicle. Any surplus funds could be held in a cash Isa. The balance built up could become a house deposit when Mike is clearer on where his career is going. \u0095 Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG Advice is for guidance only. \u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

      "body": "<p>With a Budget just nine days away and the end of the tax year approaching, savers and investors should think seriously about giving their financial affairs a spring clean. If you do nothing, certain tax exemptions could be lost forever. </p> <p>Some changes have already been announced. </p> <p>From 6 April, Miras (Mortgage Interest Relief at Source) disappears; there will also be another 1 per cent cut in the basic rate of income tax. The married couple's allowance and the married couple's age allowance for couples who are not yet 65 also disappear. </p> <p>On the investment front, the Isa regime will be pruned back. Until 5 April a maximum \u00a37,000 can be invested in stocks and shares within a maxi Isa, but this will be cut to \u00a35,000 for the next tax year, starting on April 6. Likewise the cash limit will drop from \u00a33,000 to \u00a31,000. </p> <p>These are changes we already know about. But what about those the Chancellor may impose on 21 March? </p> <p>Despite rumblings of discontent about the complexity of the Isa rules, and the rumoured 50,000 people who have broken them, the chances of Gordon Brown tinkering in this area are slim. 'We don't envisage changes to the Isa rules before the first full year has been completed,' says Anne McMeehan, director of communications at the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif). </p> <p>'It will take time for the Treasury to analyse the investment data, so we wouldn't expect changes before October at the earliest. It's just possible they might do something about the investment levels in the second year - after all \u00a35,000 is not easily divisible by 12 for regular savers - but the only things we have been talking to the authorities about are some technical issues concerning stamp duty and Cat standards.' </p> <p>Martin Sherwood of stockbroker Teather &amp; Greenwood agrees that things are unlikely to change on the Isa front, but he has heard rumours of CGT changes. 'I've heard the level could be reduced from 40 per cent to the basic 20 per cent.' He hastens to add however, that at this time of year, all sources of information are 'equally unreliable'. </p> <p>Sherwood gives more weight to rumours about a tightening on the pensions front. 'People are expecting crackdowns on the tax relief on pension contributions - along with the disappearance of current carry-forward provisions.' </p> <p>At present, if you had relevant earnings in all, or any, of the past six years and did not pay maximum contributions, you can 'carry forward' this unused relief. Similarly, if you did not pay the maximum permissible contribution in the previous year, you can pay a contribution in the current tax year and elect to have it 'carried back'. But, with the introduction of stakeholder pensions from April 2001, the carry-forward provisions will go, although people will still be able to carry back one year. </p> <p>The abolition of higher-rate tax-relief on pension contributions has been predicted every year for at least a decade, and many believe it is just the pensions companies trying to drum up business. The rumour has emerged again this year: now the stakeholder being used as the excuse. Martyn Laverick of independent financial adviser Chartwell suggests the \u00a33,600 stakeholder allowance 'may just become the benchmark for the maximum allowance anyone gets for tax-relief purposes'. </p> <p>Another area where the Chancellor may make a move is in Inheritance Tax. 'The tax-free ceiling (currently \u00a3231,000) will proba bly be raised again in line with inflation,' suggests Sherwood, 'but Brown may be more radical this year.' </p> <p>Clive Scott Hopkins, of retirement specialist Towry Law, says his best guess is that IHT reform will be postponed until the next parliament, because Brown does not want to upset Middle England. 'But he may just raise the nil rate band to \u00a3300,000, and then offset this by extending the gift period from seven to 10 years and abolish potentially exempt transfers [Pets],' he says. </p> <p>\u0095Most of the experts believe rumours about a rise in stamp duty from 0.5 per cent to 1.0 per cent to counter the rise in house prices, but overall they are predicting a fairly quiet Budget on the savings and investment front. </p> <p>All agree, however, on the basic message: take advantage of existing tax breaks because they are unlikely to get any more generous.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With a Budget just nine days away and the end of the tax year approaching, savers and investors should think seriously about giving their financial affairs a spring clean. If you do nothing, certain tax exemptions could be lost forever. Some changes have already been announced. From 6 April, Miras (Mortgage Interest Relief at Source) disappears; there will also be another 1 per cent cut in the basic rate of income tax. The married couple's allowance and the married couple's age allowance for couples who are not yet 65 also disappear. On the investment front, the Isa regime will be pruned back. Until 5 April a maximum \u00a37,000 can be invested in stocks and shares within a maxi Isa, but this will be cut to \u00a35,000 for the next tax year, starting on April 6. Likewise the cash limit will drop from \u00a33,000 to \u00a31,000. These are changes we already know about. But what about those the Chancellor may impose on 21 March? Despite rumblings of discontent about the complexity of the Isa rules, and the rumoured 50,000 people who have broken them, the chances of Gordon Brown tinkering in this area are slim. 'We don't envisage changes to the Isa rules before the first full year has been completed,' says Anne McMeehan, director of communications at the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif). 'It will take time for the Treasury to analyse the investment data, so we wouldn't expect changes before October at the earliest. It's just possible they might do something about the investment levels in the second year - after all \u00a35,000 is not easily divisible by 12 for regular savers - but the only things we have been talking to the authorities about are some technical issues concerning stamp duty and Cat standards.' Martin Sherwood of stockbroker Teather &amp; Greenwood agrees that things are unlikely to change on the Isa front, but he has heard rumours of CGT changes. 'I've heard the level could be reduced from 40 per cent to the basic 20 per cent.' He hastens to add however, that at this time of year, all sources of information are 'equally unreliable'. Sherwood gives more weight to rumours about a tightening on the pensions front. 'People are expecting crackdowns on the tax relief on pension contributions - along with the disappearance of current carry-forward provisions.' At present, if you had relevant earnings in all, or any, of the past six years and did not pay maximum contributions, you can 'carry forward' this unused relief. Similarly, if you did not pay the maximum permissible contribution in the previous year, you can pay a contribution in the current tax year and elect to have it 'carried back'. But, with the introduction of stakeholder pensions from April 2001, the carry-forward provisions will go, although people will still be able to carry back one year. The abolition of higher-rate tax-relief on pension contributions has been predicted every year for at least a decade, and many believe it is just the pensions companies trying to drum up business. The rumour has emerged again this year: now the stakeholder being used as the excuse. Martyn Laverick of independent financial adviser Chartwell suggests the \u00a33,600 stakeholder allowance 'may just become the benchmark for the maximum allowance anyone gets for tax-relief purposes'. Another area where the Chancellor may make a move is in Inheritance Tax. 'The tax-free ceiling (currently \u00a3231,000) will proba bly be raised again in line with inflation,' suggests Sherwood, 'but Brown may be more radical this year.' Clive Scott Hopkins, of retirement specialist Towry Law, says his best guess is that IHT reform will be postponed until the next parliament, because Brown does not want to upset Middle England. 'But he may just raise the nil rate band to \u00a3300,000, and then offset this by extending the gift period from seven to 10 years and abolish potentially exempt transfers [Pets],' he says. \u0095Most of the experts believe rumours about a rise in stamp duty from 0.5 per cent to 1.0 per cent to counter the rise in house prices, but overall they are predicting a fairly quiet Budget on the savings and investment front. All agree, however, on the basic message: take advantage of existing tax breaks because they are unlikely to get any more generous.",

In addition, you can transfer the capital - up to a maximum of \u00a39,000 - from a maturing Tessa to a Tessa-only Isa. </p> <p>Returns earned within the Isa tax shelter are free from income and capital gains tax, which makes it a valuable tool for tax planning.

You make a capital gain when you sell an investment which has increased in value since you bought it. Capital gains tax is payable to the Inland Revenue at a rate of either 20 per cent for basic-rate taxpayers or 40 per cent for higher-rate payers on capital gains over a certain threshold each year.

Or, alternatively, a married person can sell an investment and the spouse can reinvest the proceeds in the same investment. 'This is one of the few remaining fiscal advantages of being married,' says John Battersby, tax partner at accountant KPMG. </p> <p>For most smaller investors, capital gains fall within their annual CGT allowance, so it is only when an investor has a portfolio of \u00a350,000 or more that bed and breakfasting may be worth considering. It is unnecessary for investments held within personal equity plans and Individual Savings Accounts, as they are free of capital gains tax anyway. </p> <p><strong> Registering to receive your interest gross</strong><br> </p> <p> More than 8 million people in the UK could save an average of \u00a360 in tax on their bank and building society accounts by simply filling in a form. </p> <p>Income tax at the rate of 20 per cent is deducted from all bank and building society accounts, but if you are a non-taxpayer, you are entitled to receive your interest gross. Ask for form R85 at your savings institution and fill it in. </p> <p>Many housewives and children do not realise this option is open to them and end up paying tax unnecessarily, says Julie Lord of Cardiff adviser Cavendish Financial Management. </p> <p>However, if you have forgotten to register for gross interest, all is not lost. 'You can still reclaim up to six years' worth of tax - it's very straightforward,' says Lord. Savers should request a tax reclaim form from the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>Within families, people can save themselves tax by making sure that savings are in the name of non-taxpayers, such as a non-earning spouse. In that situation there can be quite a lot of tax to be saved, with the rate falling from a maximum of 40 per cent to zero. </p> <p><strong> Retrospective claims of personal allowance</strong><br> </p> <p> People often miss out on the benefits of tax-free allowances because they have been given the wrong tax code by the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>Allowances are deducted from your income, along with reliefs, to make your taxable income - and therefore your tax bill - smaller.

You get tax relief at the rate of tax that would have applied if you claimed the deduction at the right time. Allowances to which you may be entitled include: </p> <p> \u0095 Age-related personal allowances. People aged 65 or more can claim a higher personal allowance, worth \u00a35,720 this tax year for those aged 65 to 74, or \u00a35,980 if you are aged 75 or more. Relief is at the claimant's full rate of income tax. </p> <p> \u0095 The married couple's allowance. This is being axed from 6 April for people under 65, but this tax year it is still worth having, at \u00a31,970. However, tax relief is only available on this allowance at 10 per cent, rather than the full 23 per cent for basic-rate taxpayers, or 40 per cent for those on the higher rate. Couples where one spouse is already over the age of 65 can continue claiming the allowance - \u00a35,125 for couples where one or both partners are aged 65 to 74, and \u00a35,195 for those aged 75 or more. </p> <p> \u0095 Additional personal allow-ance.

If this is the case, there are an awful lot of volunteers, because the Inland Revenue reckons it will collect \u00a32 billion in the current tax year from this source. </p> <p>Inheritance tax is levied at the punishing rate of 40 per cent. It is payable on a person's death, on the value of their estate above \u00a3231,000 (called the nil rate band). So a taxable estate valued at \u00a3250,000 would pay \u00a37,500 in tax (40 per cent of \u00a319,000) while an estate valued at \u00a31 million would pay \u00a3307,600 (40 per cent of \u00a3769,000). </p> <p>So why, if it is avoidable, do people still get clobbered by IHT? Some, like Princess Diana, die unexpectedly without having made any provisions (Princess Diana's estate is believed to have been hit with an IHT bill for \u00a38m). Others mistakenly believe it is a 'rich person's tax'. </p> <p>What they forget however, is that if they bought a house in the 1950s or 1960s, their property alone could easily be worth quite a lot now. Then there is that inheritance from Great Aunt Bertha, the business they own, or those life insurance policies they have been paying into for years. Pretty soon, \u00a3231,000 doesn't look quite so much. </p> <p>There are basically two methods of IHT planning. You can build up a fund with which to pay the bill when it arrives, or try to reduce the eventual bill. Reducing the bill is made easier by a range of exemptions allowed under the IHT legislation. </p> <p>The most important is that assets passing between spouses, during their lifetime or on death, are exempt from the tax. Less important, but also exempt, are gifts to charities, political parties or national bodies. Other exempt gifts include regular transfers out of income that do not affect the donor's nor mal standard of living. In addition you can make a gift of \u00a33,000 every year, small gifts of up to \u00a3250, and marriage gifts (up to \u00a35,000 from parents, \u00a32,500 from grandparents and \u00a31,000 from others) all without incurring a tax liability. </p> <p>Outside of the above, outright gifts made during lifetime come under the heading of a 'potentially exempt transfer (Pet)'. If you remain alive for seven years after making a Pet, the gift falls out of the estate for tax purposes. Should you die within the seven-year period, the transfer is taxed on a sliding scale basis You can't, however, give your home to your children on the condition you remain living in it, as this is considered a 'gift with reservation' and would still form part of your estate. </p> <p>Giving away assets during lifetime may cheat the taxman, but could be impracticable. So, having a will that spells out clearly where assets should go on death is essential, particularly from an IHT viewpoint. </p> <p>Both husband and wife have the nil rate band allowance of \u00a3231,000, so it makes sense to use both where possible. On the death of the first partner, assets could be passed to the children up to the nil rate band, with the balance passing to the survivor. When the second partner dies, another nil rate band is available for use. Even after death, if nothing has been done, a spouse can execute a deed of variation redirecting some of the assets. </p> <p>Investments can be put in a discretionary trust written into the will, with the spouse and children as beneficiaries. By this method the spouse can still get income or capital from the investments, but on death the assets will not incur tax. </p> <p>Where the main asset is the family home, it may well be difficult to reduce the IHT bill by much, if at all. Here it makes sense to find a tax-efficient method of building up enough cash to meet the bill when it comes. </p> <p>Usually, in tax planning circles, this will mean the use of a whole life insurance policy. For a married couple, a policy is taken out on both their lives, paying out on the second death. </p> <p> This policy is written in trust, so the proceeds do not count as part of the estate. The beneficiaries will normally be the children, who can use the proceeds to pay off the tax bill.Measures to avoid or reduce IHT can become complex, so this is probably one area where the 'go it alone' approach is not advisable. </p> <p>Professional help should be taken, and with rumours that Pets may be abolished in the upcoming Budget, this should be done sooner rather than later.</p>",

Some, like Princess Diana, die unexpectedly without having made any provisions (Princess Diana's estate is believed to have been hit with an IHT bill for \u00a38m). Others mistakenly believe it is a 'rich person's tax'. What they forget however, is that if they bought a house in the 1950s or 1960s, their property alone could easily be worth quite a lot now. Then there is that inheritance from Great Aunt Bertha, the business they own, or those life insurance policies they have been paying into for years. Pretty soon, \u00a3231,000 doesn't look quite so much. There are basically two methods of IHT planning. You can build up a fund with which to pay the bill when it arrives, or try to reduce the eventual bill. Reducing the bill is made easier by a range of exemptions allowed under the IHT legislation. The most important is that assets passing between spouses, during their lifetime or on death, are exempt from the tax. Less important, but also exempt, are gifts to charities, political parties or national bodies. Other exempt gifts include regular transfers out of income that do not affect the donor's nor mal standard of living. In addition you can make a gift of \u00a33,000 every year, small gifts of up to \u00a3250, and marriage gifts (up to \u00a35,000 from parents, \u00a32,500 from grandparents and \u00a31,000 from others) all without incurring a tax liability. Outside of the above, outright gifts made during lifetime come under the heading of a 'potentially exempt transfer (Pet)'. If you remain alive for seven years after making a Pet, the gift falls out of the estate for tax purposes. Should you die within the seven-year period, the transfer is taxed on a sliding scale basis You can't, however, give your home to your children on the condition you remain living in it, as this is considered a 'gift with reservation' and would still form part of your estate. Giving away assets during lifetime may cheat the taxman, but could be impracticable. So, having a will that spells out clearly where assets should go on death is essential, particularly from an IHT viewpoint. Both husband and wife have the nil rate band allowance of \u00a3231,000, so it makes sense to use both where possible. On the death of the first partner, assets could be passed to the children up to the nil rate band, with the balance passing to the survivor. When the second partner dies, another nil rate band is available for use. Even after death, if nothing has been done, a spouse can execute a deed of variation redirecting some of the assets. Investments can be put in a discretionary trust written into the will, with the spouse and children as beneficiaries. By this method the spouse can still get income or capital from the investments, but on death the assets will not incur tax. Where the main asset is the family home, it may well be difficult to reduce the IHT bill by much, if at all. Here it makes sense to find a tax-efficient method of building up enough cash to meet the bill when it comes. Usually, in tax planning circles, this will mean the use of a whole life insurance policy. For a married couple, a policy is taken out on both their lives, paying out on the second death. This policy is written in trust, so the proceeds do not count as part of the estate. The beneficiaries will normally be the children, who can use the proceeds to pay off the tax bill.Measures to avoid or reduce IHT can become complex, so this is probably one area where the 'go it alone' approach is not advisable. Professional help should be taken, and with rumours that Pets may be abolished in the upcoming Budget, this should be done sooner rather than later.",

If, as it sounds, brother A gave brother B a loan with no strings attached and no interest payable, brother B is now returning brother A's money and, on top, making him a gift of \u00a348,000. </p> <p>Potentially, this \u00a348,000 is subject to inheritance tax, but none will be payable if brother B survives for another seven years, or if he dies sooner and his entire estate is worth less than the inheritance tax nil-rate band, which this year is \u00a3231,000. </p> <p>But if brother B had agreed to pay interest on the loan, and the \u00a348,000 is regarded as interest, the Inland Revenue could demand income tax from brother A. Or, if the loan was treated as an investment for brother A, entitling him to share of any profit when the house is sold, brother A has made a capital gain on a home which is not his main residence, so capital gains tax is payable on all gains above this year's \u00a37,100 capital gains tax allowance. </p> <p>Assuming the first scenario, neither brother has to record the payment on a tax return, as the question of tax arises only if brother B dies early. But if brother A buys, say, unit trusts with the money and declares the dividends on his tax return, the Revenue may ask where the \u00a385,000 came from. If the two were unrelated, it would be hard to convince the taxman that the original loan was an act of generosity.

I closed the credit card account, but a month later, Egg debited another \u00a31,200 from my bank plus charges, sending me overdrawn again. </p> <p>I want compensation, an explanation and an apology that I can present to my bank to explain the unauthorised overdrafts. I have written several times to Egg, by post and email, but so far they have ignored me.<br><strong>RK, Reading </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Internet banking gives customers instant access to their accounts, but it takes three days for Egg to activate direct debits. These three days were critical because the direct debit process started before the money was due and before your payment arrived by cheque. This is why you overpaid the first time. But then Egg took out \u00a31,200 again 'due to an administrative error'. </p> <p>There is no explanation for this, nor for why it failed to answer your letters. Egg says it will compensate you for any overdraft charges and other expenses you incurred - let them know how much this is - and is sending you a letter which proves to your bank that it was not your fault you went overdrawn. </p> <p><strong> AA windfall: No pay, no excuse</strong><br> </p> <p>I was an associate member of the AA for several years on my father's membership, until my twenty-first birthday last June, when I wanted to become a full member.

The IDB refused. The Department says aid was not requested until 29 February, when Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers met H&amp;W chief executive Brynjulv Mugaas and Ulster MPs including Peter Robinson, whose East Belfast seat includes the yard, and David Trimble. A DTI official said it was Byers who urged H&amp;W to put in a request. The \u00a3400m aid package was offered by the department only six days later. A DTI source said: 'The company came to us very late, and only put in a bid when we encouraged them to do so.'",

First, there is the survey news that children in relatively well-off families (ie: Hit's target consumers) have no idea about budgets and believe that banks provide grown-ups with endless cash which arrives from holes in the wall as though by magic.This can only bode well for the company's merchandising efforts.

According to reports, the 'baby-luxe' markets is one of the fastest growing consumer niches in the United States. Ostrich feather cribs, designer nappy-changing tables and cashmere blankets are now standard kit for even the most moderately go-getter parent. But by restricting itself to practical baby bouncers and sensible non-toxic wooden objects, Mothercare is turning its back on these opportunities. In the US, the seriously bonkers pay specialist decorators up to \u00a330,000 to set up a nursery. Over here it is still mostly a matter of two tins of Dulux and a mobile. A few weeks ago this paper reported that due to medical advances many babies born today can expect to live to 120. It is Mothercare's solemn duty to get parents of newborns used to shelling out straight away.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Trafficmaster</p> <p>THE COMPANY that aims to take the Hartley's out of traffic jams, unveils full-year figures on Tuesday. Analysts predict pre-tax profits rising to \u00a34 million, from \u00a33.2m. A strong rise, but whether this is enough to justify Trafficmaster's future price/earnings ratio of 377 is open to question. </p> <p>The shares have been bolstered over the past 12 months by a whirlwind of activity.

It has also teamed up with Motorola and Blaupunkt to develop a new 'smarter' navigation system that is aware of traffic conditions and can plot the quickest route accordingly. </p> <p>A range of alliances with the likes of the AA and the RAC, not to mention a host of vehicle manufacturers, has also done much to strengthen the company's position. </p> <p>But it is the technology side of things that attracts the City. As much of the company's systems work via wireless and fixed-line Internet protocols, Trafficmaster is now enjoying the lucrative reputation that comes with being an online player. </p>",

But by restricting itself to practical baby bouncers and sensible non-toxic wooden objects, Mothercare is turning its back on these opportunities. In the US, the seriously bonkers pay specialist decorators up to \u00a330,000 to set up a nursery. Over here it is still mostly a matter of two tins of Dulux and a mobile. A few weeks ago this paper reported that due to medical advances many babies born today can expect to live to 120. It is Mothercare's solemn duty to get parents of newborns used to shelling out straight away. Watch out for: Trafficmaster THE COMPANY that aims to take the Hartley's out of traffic jams, unveils full-year figures on Tuesday. Analysts predict pre-tax profits rising to \u00a34 million, from \u00a33.2m. A strong rise, but whether this is enough to justify Trafficmaster's future price/earnings ratio of 377 is open to question. The shares have been bolstered over the past 12 months by a whirlwind of activity. Trafficmaster, established in 1988 and initially launched as a pilot project on the M25, has been busy developing new ways to help us get around safely and more efficiently. Recently it unveiled Fleetstar, a product that allows vehicles to be tracked via global satellite positioning technology - handy for bosses keeping tabs on dawdling employees. It has also teamed up with Motorola and Blaupunkt to develop a new 'smarter' navigation system that is aware of traffic conditions and can plot the quickest route accordingly. A range of alliances with the likes of the AA and the RAC, not to mention a host of vehicle manufacturers, has also done much to strengthen the company's position. But it is the technology side of things that attracts the City. As much of the company's systems work via wireless and fixed-line Internet protocols, Trafficmaster is now enjoying the lucrative reputation that comes with being an online player.",

Twenty-seven years later - on 3 March 2000 - the paper roared again: 'Fears of petrol at \u00a34 a gallon.' </p> <p>Take out inflation, and this is a chance for those with a taste for history repeating itself to say that some things never change. It may be more accurate to say that things do change but not enough to prove we have learnt from our mistakes. </p> <p>The industrialised West has spent recent months worrying over the trebling of oil prices, from around $10 a barrel a year ago to touch $32 last week, fuelled by a 2-million-barrel-a-day shortage. Leo Drollas of the Centre for Global Energy Studies says this 168 per cent increase is the second-biggest since 1973. </p> <p>The West is upset with the 11-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which is due to decide on 27 March whether to produce more, thereby easing prices. </p> <p>US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been touring the world's oil capitals, trying to avoid US petrol prices rising from $1.40 a US gallon to between $1.80 and $2 in election year. </p> <p>Parallels have quickly been drawn with the Seventies oil crisis. And just as quickly, they have been dismissed. </p> <p>The world, after all, has changed. For one thing, says Stephen Turner, oil analyst at HSBC investment bank, 'there is no Arab-Israeli war'. </p> <p>Today's problems have been triggered by economics, not politics. Opec has simply acted to raise the price of oil from its trough last February. The Vienna-based body now accounts for only 44 per cent of world production, compared with 56 per cent in the Seventies. </p> <p>Also, the world economy is not so dependent on oil. Services have replaced traditional industries, and other forms of energy have been found. </p> <p>Inflation is now around 2 per cent across the 30 industrialised nations belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - well below the double-digit levels of 30 years ago, which were themselves fuelled by rising oil prices. </p> <p>The weight of oil in the UK Retail Prices Index, for example, is 3.6 per cent; it was 10 per cent then. North Sea oil has given us a \u00a34 billion trade surplus in oil, replacing a deficit. And the effect on UK petrol prices is less than in the US because so much of our petrol price is tax. </p> <p>In short, the West is not threatened this time by balance-of-payments shocks. </p> <p>But one thing does not seem to have changed: the ability of the West and Opec to blunder and worsen the crisis. As events unfolded in 1973 it became clear that although, in the West's eyes, Opec was behaving outrageously, the western governments were acting incompetently. </p> <p>That crisis grew from the decline in co-operation between the oil-rich Arab world and the West through events such as Libya's Islamic revolution, and growing hostility to America's support for Israel. </p> <p>Middle-eastern and north African countries were at the time nationalising their oil industries, making western oil firms mere contractors. </p> <p>King Faisal of Saudi Arabia feared his country would be isolated within Opec because it had good relations with the US. Faisal warned the four US oil giants in the Saudi-based Aramco consortium that they would 'lose everything' unless US support for Israel cooled. But warnings from Aramco were ignored by President Richard Nixon. </p> <p>In April Opec called for talks with major oil companies. Spurred on by Libya, Algeria and Venezuela, it wanted price rises to compensate for the fall in the value of the dollar, the currency in which oil is valued, which had cut its members' earnings. </p> <p>BP's then chairman, Sir Eric Drake, said: 'The era of cheap energy ... is, I believe, behind us.' </p> <p>In August, Faisal and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat agreed to cut oil supplies if US policy did not change. Opec called more talks, saying the 1971 Tehran Agreement with the oil companies, intended to set prices until 1975, was giving the firms 'high unearned profits'. </p> <p>Then, on 6 October, Egypt and Syria invaded Israel. Ten days later, the Gulf states triggered the energy crisis by raising the price of crude oil by 66 per cent to $5 a barrel. </p> <p>The implications were appalling. The Financial Times economics correspondent at the time, William Keegan, wrote that the UK balance of payments would be hit by between \u00a3600m and \u00a31bn - huge amounts then. </p> <p>Worse was to come. In November the OECD warned that an industrial world trade surplus of $10bn in 1974 could be cut to zero, and in December an Opec meeting in Tehran indicated higher prices still for the coming year. By late January 1974, the benchmark Arabian light crude was $11.65 per barrel. </p> <p>In Britain, industry's raw materials and fuel bills rose by 17 per cent in one month because of the oil price, provoking a panic worsened by a wave of industrial action. Electricity workers, railwaymen and miners banned overtime. There were selective power cuts, followed at the end of December by the three-day working week. </p> <p>Parliament was recalled early for a two-day debate on the energy crisis. When a strike ballot by the miners showed 81 per cent in favour of walking out, the Tory Prime Minister, Ted Heath, called a general election. He lost and was replaced by Labour's Harold Wilson. </p> <p>In March, the UK balance of payments deficit fell from \u00a3429m the previous month to \u00a3453m. The oil deficit was a staggering \u00a3294m. </p> <p>However, Opec's unity was cracking. On 27 January, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister, Sheikh Yamani, said King Faisal wanted price cuts to help the world economy. </p> <p>But Iran, still led by the Shah, pushed for a price rise to $14 a barrel. In May, Kuwait cut production, which again saw prices leap. </p> <p>The Saudis, however, continued in their attempts to moderate Opec's squeeze, and in December Yamani offered to undercut the cartel's $10.12-a-barrel basic price, although this held up into 1975. </p> <p>In January that year US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned that American military action over the high oil prices could not be ruled out. He introduced a plan for a floor price on oil to encourage investment outside the Gulf, in areas such as the North Sea. At the same time western governments boosted their nuclear power programmes to counter their dependence on oil. </p> <p>The oil price wavered throughout 1975 and 1976, before falling as the unity of Opec cracked further. </p> <p>In Britain, the energy problem had created a disastrous economic inheritance for the Labour government. International investors took fright, and sterling tumbled. </p> <p>Ironically, it was oil that rescued the pound when, in 1977, the world realised that Britain, by opening up the North Sea fields, was becoming an oil exporter. </p> <p>Circumstances today are different, but the West's capacity for misjudging the Middle East remains. </p> <p>Paul Hornsell of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies says: 'The West is again playing a poor hand. There has been a growing clamour to do something. Bill Richardson has been trying to get the oil nations to release more oil, but all he has done is to stoke up the oil price. These things are best not left in the hands of western politicians.' </p> <p>Drollas, of the Centre for Global Energy Studies, believes there are more fundamental problems. The failure of the West so far to broker a lasting peace between the Arab states and Israel, together with instability around Iraq means, that military spending in the region - which underpins the need for oil revenues - dwarfs that of the West. </p> <p>Compared with US defence spending of 5 per cent of its gross domestic product and the UK proportion of 3.5 per cent, Saudi Arabia spends 16 per cent, Oman 14 per cent and Kuwait 13 per cent. With Saddam Hussein still there as a neighbour, despite US intervention, who can blame them? </p> <p>Now, as then, Opec has its own problems. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico want to increase supply. Others, such as Iran, Libya and Algeria, want the present production limits to remain through the summer. A suggested compromise, pumping out an extra 1.2 million barrels a day, is 800,000 too few, and has made the price rise still steeper. </p> <p>And once again, says Drollas, Opec has misjudged things: 'In the autumn it needed to increase supply because stocks were falling, but it said inventories were healthy. They were using outdated figures. It now has to cope with a very difficult position - judging how to release oil onto the market without losing control of prices.' </p> <p>The Opec nations have their economic problems, which should not be written off. Hawkish states remain hawkish because they have smaller oil reserves. </p> <p>Drollas adds: 'Inflation may be lower than in 1973. But it has still doubled in the OECD from 1 per cent to 2, largely thanks to the oil price.' </p> <p>And oil is still the primary source of 40 per cent of the world's energy. In some sectors, such as transport, it is still almost the only fuel in town. </p> <p>It is too early to say: 'Crisis, what crisis?'</p>",

The convenience store operator's shares may, at 50p, be near their all-time low. But following the firm's results last month, the full extent of its trading and debt problems are clear. At the current price, with its \u00a3175m of borrowings, Alldays is trading on a multiple of 13 times its total debt plus equity divided by operating earnings. That's higher than Tesco, Sainsbury and Morrisons, suggesting little upside from here. Avoid.",

      "body": "<p><strong> A losing bid that just wasn't cricket</strong><br> For those who missed the full fun of Kelvin MacKenzie's talkSport Radio losing its bid for radio Test Cricket rights against the BBC - who incidentally offered to pay less - here are the edited highlights. </p> <p>In a statement pondering why his money wasn't good enough, MacKenzie said: 'Is it because we don't talk like a peer of the realm? Lord McLaurin, who earned his peerage by selling Brussels sprouts [at Tesco], refused in the end to sell us the rights. It's a disgrace, and we will be using this case as a further illustration of why we need to go to the Competition Commission to see the BBC broken up.' </p> <p>Losing his composure on R4 Kelvin ranted about the Corporation being 'up shit creek without a paddle' at 8.30am, which would have caused a spillage of Lord McLaurin's Earl Grey. An entire fresh pot would have been needed when Mackenzie went on to claim that, as his failed bid had involved free helmets for schools, the next child who died playing cricket would have effectively been killed by the satanic Beeb. Not surprisingly, the normally matey R4 presenter suddenly discovered there was no more time to listen to Kelvin's reasonable views and he was faded out. </p> <p>The story, albeit unconfirmed, is that Greg Dyke and the BBC bruisers threatened to pull out of TV rights bidding against C4 unless they got the radio rights - a course of action sadly not open to the audio-only MacKenzie. </p> <p><strong> A bitchy tale of two Jeremys</strong><br> Because Jeremy 'Paxo' Paxman is the most talented male broadcaster in Britain, by a country mile, we would prefer to think of him as having no taint on his character. </p> <p>So, can it be true that Sian Kevill, editor of Newsnight, has had to slap Jeremy's wrists for being beastly to the new boy? The allegations, false we are sure, are that Mr Paxman has been referring to the other Jeremy, Jeremy Vine as 'mini-me' and holding up his little finger, no doubt to indicate the junior stature. </p> <p>Tsk, tsk, except, of course, that it may be a bit disconcerting to be followed around by someone mirroring your mannerisms and appearance. </p> <p><strong>A case of SWA: Single White Anchor</strong> </p> <p> Beeb's T-Rex? Too lowbrow by miles We hear Walking With Dinosaurs is to be remodelled for the US market. Could it be that they wish to Disney-fy it, turn it into a Jurassic Park?

      "bodyText": "A losing bid that just wasn't cricket For those who missed the full fun of Kelvin MacKenzie's talkSport Radio losing its bid for radio Test Cricket rights against the BBC - who incidentally offered to pay less - here are the edited highlights. In a statement pondering why his money wasn't good enough, MacKenzie said: 'Is it because we don't talk like a peer of the realm? Lord McLaurin, who earned his peerage by selling Brussels sprouts [at Tesco], refused in the end to sell us the rights. It's a disgrace, and we will be using this case as a further illustration of why we need to go to the Competition Commission to see the BBC broken up.' Losing his composure on R4 Kelvin ranted about the Corporation being 'up shit creek without a paddle' at 8.30am, which would have caused a spillage of Lord McLaurin's Earl Grey. An entire fresh pot would have been needed when Mackenzie went on to claim that, as his failed bid had involved free helmets for schools, the next child who died playing cricket would have effectively been killed by the satanic Beeb. Not surprisingly, the normally matey R4 presenter suddenly discovered there was no more time to listen to Kelvin's reasonable views and he was faded out. The story, albeit unconfirmed, is that Greg Dyke and the BBC bruisers threatened to pull out of TV rights bidding against C4 unless they got the radio rights - a course of action sadly not open to the audio-only MacKenzie. A bitchy tale of two Jeremys Because Jeremy 'Paxo' Paxman is the most talented male broadcaster in Britain, by a country mile, we would prefer to think of him as having no taint on his character. So, can it be true that Sian Kevill, editor of Newsnight, has had to slap Jeremy's wrists for being beastly to the new boy? The allegations, false we are sure, are that Mr Paxman has been referring to the other Jeremy, Jeremy Vine as 'mini-me' and holding up his little finger, no doubt to indicate the junior stature. Tsk, tsk, except, of course, that it may be a bit disconcerting to be followed around by someone mirroring your mannerisms and appearance. A case of SWA: Single White Anchor Beeb's T-Rex? Too lowbrow by miles We hear Walking With Dinosaurs is to be remodelled for the US market. Could it be that they wish to Disney-fy it, turn it into a Jurassic Park? Make the dinosaurs more cutesy, cuddly? Er, no actually. Apparently, Discovery Channel feels that the version shown in the UK was a bit, er, basic in scientific terms. So, a few palaeontologists and Professor Pointy Heads are being inter-cut in the Velociraptor action sequences to give the programme a bit more intellectual bottom.",

      "body": "<p>With the benefit of hindsight, the grass skirt should have been a giveaway. It was the mid-Eighties and the investors' love affair with biotechnology companies was at its most passionate. Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist by training, was chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://http://www.gene.com/\" target=\"_new\">Genentech</a> - one of the few biotech groups that had managed to bring some products to market. </p> <p>Swanson was riding the wave of biotech fever with great enthusiasm. His company had developed a product, t-PA, which was hailed (largely by Genentech itself) as the greatest advance to date in the treatment of life-threatening blood clots. The company's share price had rocketed. Employees were encouraged to don T-shirts bearing the words 'Clot Buster'. And Swanson missed no opportunity to celebrate Genentech's success. He regularly organised Friday afternoon parties at the head office. These gatherings were enlivened with pie-throwing and water pistol fights and, on occasion, Swanson would bring the event to a hilarious climax by donning a grass skirt to dance the hula. </p> <p>Investors were not concerned. They would let nothing qualify their affection for Genentech. Biotech was the sector to invest in and Genentech was the biotech company. </p> <p>At least, that is what they believed in 1987. Then, some more cautious souls began to subject Genentech to some of the more conventional tests of investment analysis. Was its share price really justified by even the most optimistic of earnings forecasts? Should investors not worry that there was no hope - even in the medium-term - of the company giving its shareholders even modest income from dividends? </p> <p>Genentech's share price, which had touched $65, fell to $18 within 12 months. Swanson hung up his grass skirt. </p> <p>The Genentech episode was just one example of a share price gaining a momentum that defied the conventional rules of stock market pricing. And now, more than a decade later, analysts are struggling to find a new set of rules by which the soaring share prices of a new group of companies - 'dot.com' stocks - can be explained. </p> <p>The 'conventional' tools of valuation seem to have been abandoned. How else could a company such as Baltimore Technology, with monthly sales of \u00a32 million and losses of \u00a33m be deemed worthy of inclusion in the FTSE-100 when Whitbread, with monthly sales of \u00a3250m and profits of nearly \u00a330m is not?. </p> <p>But even the 'conventional' measures are relatively young. At the start of the twentieth century, there were some rough-and-ready rules for estimating how much a company should be worth. The world had moved on from the days of the South Sea Company, whose success in the early eighteenth century had spawned scores of imitators whose only aim was to part gullible investors from their money. </p> <p>Money was raised to extract silver from lead, build a wheel of perpetual motion and trade in human hair, among many other things. Most strikingly of all, one unidentified soul launched 'a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody is to know what it is'. Dozens of people subscribed funds for this project. The promoter closed his doors after five hours, took the money and vanished. </p> <p>But it was only after the First World War that a generally accepted system for valuing shares was devised. It was outlined by American John Williams in The Theory of Investment Value. The basis of his ideas was simple: that every investment has an 'intrinsic value', and that value is determined by the dividend income it yields now and the likely rate of increase in the future. Add up all that future income, apply a 'discount rate' according to the difference one attributes to money this year as opposed to money in the future, and bingo: you can work out the current intrinsic value. </p> <p>In theory, the idea seems fine. If a share's price is less than its intrinsic value, it should be bought; if its price is higher than its intrinsic value, it should be sold. </p> <p>But there are two clear snags: first, over what period does the investor assume a particular growth rate for the income an investment will yield? Second, what if the discount rate were to change? This would throw out comparisons between a share currently giving a high yield but with low growth prospects and a second stock with low yield but better growth prospects. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the notion of intrinsic value - helped by the publication of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's seminal work Security Analysis - provided the underpinning of valuations for a generation of investors. Dividend yields were the crucial measure of a share's value. Arguably, the more modern approach - of comparing a share's price with the net earnings attributable to that share - is merely a variation on the well-established theme. After all, no company can pay dividends for very long unless it has the earnings from which to pay them. </p> <p>The main intellectual challenge to the idea came from the eminent economist John Maynard Keynes, whose 1936 General Theory pointed out that no one really knows what is going to influence future earnings and dividends. So investors spend their time trying to anticipate how the view held by the rest of the market will change. Every other investor is trying to do the same. So the market is trying to guess what the market guesses the market will guess. </p> <p>Keynes wrote: 'It is not sensible to pay 25 for an investment of which you believe the prospective yield to justify a value of 30 if you also believe that the market will value it at 20 in three months' time.' </p> <p>Keynes used the famous example of a beauty contest in a newspaper. The reader's aim is to select the six prettiest faces from 100. The winner is the person whose choice conforms most closely to the average of all those who enter the contest. The sensible strategy is not to choose the six which you individually find most pleasing, but to choose those which you believe the readership will select. But every other canny reader will be doing the same. So, you have to guess what other readers guess other readers will guess. </p> <p>If you apply this to invest ments, prices of shares can sustain a level well above what their intrinsic value would suggest. They stay there not because the shares' holders believe that this is the 'right' price, but because they believe other investors will soon believe that the market will believe them to be worth more. </p> <p>Nevertheless, since the Sixties, the main plank of share valuation has been that of price/earnings ratios: a share priced at 120p in a company which will give earnings per share this year of 10p has a p/e ratio of 12, for example. And since the mid-Nineties, a variation of this has appeared under the acronym of EV/EBITDA, standing for Enterprise Value divided by Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. Enterprise value equates to a company's stock market value plus its debts: in other words, the enterprise value of a company with a market capitalisation of \u00a36m and debts of \u00a34m has an enterprise value of \u00a310m. </p> <p>A further measure which has its supporters is economic value added: this is a fiendishly complicated varia tion on an old favourite of discounted cash flow - taking the flow of cash a company is likely to produce over coming years and attributing a current value to that flow. </p> <p>But - particularly in the current environment, where huge values are being put on companies which are making losses and will do so for years to come - measures such as yields and book value are looking quaint but unloved. </p> <p>The essential point is this: conventional valuation mea sures have been abandoned at regular intervals over most of the twentieth century. In the 18 months between March 1928 and September 1929, share prices on Wall Street increased by more than they had in the previous five years. Exactly as Keynes was later to explain, people bought shares because - whether or not they thought the prices were already too high - they believed that they would go higher. In those 18 months, the price of shares in Radio Corporation of America increased fivefold. (After the Great Crash, they fell by 97 per cent from their September 1929 peak.) </p> <p>Between 1959 and 1962, there was a fashion for what were then considered high-tech stocks, the 'tronics boom'. To be highly rated, a company had to have a name which suggested that it was a 'tron' - Astron, Vulcatron, Transitron, Circuitronics and Videotronics, for example. </p> <p>The American Music Guild, whose business consisted of selling records and record players door-to-door, caught the Zeitgeist. It changed its name to Space-Tone, and its share price rose sevenfold within a few weeks. </p> <p>As with all crazes, it died out - and investors suffered. Take one example - Hydro-Space Technology. It was floated at $3 a share in July 1960. The price hit $7 on their first day of trading. Their low in 1962 was $1. </p> <p>In the mid-Sixties, conglomerates became fashionable. Many of their shares were selling on price/earnings multiples of 40 and 50. By 1969, their prices had tumbled and p/e ratios were down to a less giddy 10-15. </p> <p>Also in the mid-Sixties, there was a boom in 'concept stocks' where a company was highly-rated because it had a smart idea even if it was unclear how this would ever be translated into income. (This may sound eerily familiar to observers looking at dot.com stocks today.) P/e ratios commonly topped 100. </p> <p>In the early Seventies, the vogue was to invest only in large, blue-chip stocks. In the US, this clutch of favoured behemoths was known as the 'Nifty Fifty'. The fad drove Polaroid's shares to a p/e of 90 and McDonald's to 83. (By 1980 their p/e ratios were 16 and 9 respectively.) Just as the notion of a two-tier market has been so discussed in the past 18 months, Forbes magazine remarked at the time that '[the Nifty Fifty appeared to rise up] from the ocean; it was as though all of the US but Nebraska had sunk into the sea. The two-tier market really consisted of one tier and a lot of rubble down below.' </p> <p>In 1983, there was a rerun of the early-Sixties boom. New issues were the fad. In that year alone, new issues raised more money in the US than in all of the Seventies. The message was simple: if a company was coming to market, buy the shares; they were bound to go up. And go up they did - until they collapsed, by an average of 50 per cent, in spring 1984. </p> <p>Also in the Eighties, biotechnology became fashionable - for a while. Genentech led the way in 1980: its share price almost tripled on its first day. There were plenty of followers. And analysts had to find ways of measuring the extraordinary valuations these companies attracted: some were selling not on price/earnings ratios of 50 (which would have been optimistic enough) but at prices which represented 50 times these companies' annual sales . In the second half of the Eighties, biotech stocks lost, on average, about three-quarters of their value. </p> <p>There were other disasters. Heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard put his name to an anti-ageing cream from a company called Alfin Fragrances; the cream failed to gain approval, and Alfin's share price fell by 95 per cent in three years. Other companies whose shares were fleetingly hailed as the new IBM (not many people knew of Microsoft then) were exposed as simply fraudulent. </p> <p>Each speculative boom has forced analysts to devise a new way of valuing stocks and providing their ridiculous prices with a veneer of credibility. Each boom must have had John Williams and Benjamin Graham spinning in their graves. Keynes would merely have laughed. </p> <p><strong>Cheerleaders for the new paradigm</strong><br> There is an inherent problem in describing Internet stocks as 'overvalued', because their cheerleaders insist that they are only overvalued on the 'old' valuation models, which rely on dull things such as profits and revenues.

      "bodyText": "With the benefit of hindsight, the grass skirt should have been a giveaway. It was the mid-Eighties and the investors' love affair with biotechnology companies was at its most passionate. Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist by training, was chief executive officer of Genentech - one of the few biotech groups that had managed to bring some products to market. Swanson was riding the wave of biotech fever with great enthusiasm. His company had developed a product, t-PA, which was hailed (largely by Genentech itself) as the greatest advance to date in the treatment of life-threatening blood clots. The company's share price had rocketed. Employees were encouraged to don T-shirts bearing the words 'Clot Buster'. And Swanson missed no opportunity to celebrate Genentech's success. He regularly organised Friday afternoon parties at the head office. These gatherings were enlivened with pie-throwing and water pistol fights and, on occasion, Swanson would bring the event to a hilarious climax by donning a grass skirt to dance the hula. Investors were not concerned. They would let nothing qualify their affection for Genentech. Biotech was the sector to invest in and Genentech was the biotech company. At least, that is what they believed in 1987. Then, some more cautious souls began to subject Genentech to some of the more conventional tests of investment analysis. Was its share price really justified by even the most optimistic of earnings forecasts? Should investors not worry that there was no hope - even in the medium-term - of the company giving its shareholders even modest income from dividends? Genentech's share price, which had touched $65, fell to $18 within 12 months. Swanson hung up his grass skirt. The Genentech episode was just one example of a share price gaining a momentum that defied the conventional rules of stock market pricing. And now, more than a decade later, analysts are struggling to find a new set of rules by which the soaring share prices of a new group of companies - 'dot.com' stocks - can be explained. The 'conventional' tools of valuation seem to have been abandoned. How else could a company such as Baltimore Technology, with monthly sales of \u00a32 million and losses of \u00a33m be deemed worthy of inclusion in the FTSE-100 when Whitbread, with monthly sales of \u00a3250m and profits of nearly \u00a330m is not?. But even the 'conventional' measures are relatively young. At the start of the twentieth century, there were some rough-and-ready rules for estimating how much a company should be worth. The world had moved on from the days of the South Sea Company, whose success in the early eighteenth century had spawned scores of imitators whose only aim was to part gullible investors from their money. Money was raised to extract silver from lead, build a wheel of perpetual motion and trade in human hair, among many other things. Most strikingly of all, one unidentified soul launched 'a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody is to know what it is'. Dozens of people subscribed funds for this project. The promoter closed his doors after five hours, took the money and vanished. But it was only after the First World War that a generally accepted system for valuing shares was devised. It was outlined by American John Williams in The Theory of Investment Value. The basis of his ideas was simple: that every investment has an 'intrinsic value', and that value is determined by the dividend income it yields now and the likely rate of increase in the future. Add up all that future income, apply a 'discount rate' according to the difference one attributes to money this year as opposed to money in the future, and bingo: you can work out the current intrinsic value. In theory, the idea seems fine. If a share's price is less than its intrinsic value, it should be bought; if its price is higher than its intrinsic value, it should be sold. But there are two clear snags: first, over what period does the investor assume a particular growth rate for the income an investment will yield? Second, what if the discount rate were to change? This would throw out comparisons between a share currently giving a high yield but with low growth prospects and a second stock with low yield but better growth prospects. Nevertheless, the notion of intrinsic value - helped by the publication of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's seminal work Security Analysis - provided the underpinning of valuations for a generation of investors. Dividend yields were the crucial measure of a share's value. Arguably, the more modern approach - of comparing a share's price with the net earnings attributable to that share - is merely a variation on the well-established theme. After all, no company can pay dividends for very long unless it has the earnings from which to pay them. The main intellectual challenge to the idea came from the eminent economist John Maynard Keynes, whose 1936 General Theory pointed out that no one really knows what is going to influence future earnings and dividends. So investors spend their time trying to anticipate how the view held by the rest of the market will change. Every other investor is trying to do the same. So the market is trying to guess what the market guesses the market will guess. Keynes wrote: 'It is not sensible to pay 25 for an investment of which you believe the prospective yield to justify a value of 30 if you also believe that the market will value it at 20 in three months' time.' Keynes used the famous example of a beauty contest in a newspaper. The reader's aim is to select the six prettiest faces from 100. The winner is the person whose choice conforms most closely to the average of all those who enter the contest. The sensible strategy is not to choose the six which you individually find most pleasing, but to choose those which you believe the readership will select. But every other canny reader will be doing the same. So, you have to guess what other readers guess other readers will guess. If you apply this to invest ments, prices of shares can sustain a level well above what their intrinsic value would suggest. They stay there not because the shares' holders believe that this is the 'right' price, but because they believe other investors will soon believe that the market will believe them to be worth more. Nevertheless, since the Sixties, the main plank of share valuation has been that of price/earnings ratios: a share priced at 120p in a company which will give earnings per share this year of 10p has a p/e ratio of 12, for example. And since the mid-Nineties, a variation of this has appeared under the acronym of EV/EBITDA, standing for Enterprise Value divided by Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. Enterprise value equates to a company's stock market value plus its debts: in other words, the enterprise value of a company with a market capitalisation of \u00a36m and debts of \u00a34m has an enterprise value of \u00a310m. A further measure which has its supporters is economic value added: this is a fiendishly complicated varia tion on an old favourite of discounted cash flow - taking the flow of cash a company is likely to produce over coming years and attributing a current value to that flow. But - particularly in the current environment, where huge values are being put on companies which are making losses and will do so for years to come - measures such as yields and book value are looking quaint but unloved. The essential point is this: conventional valuation mea sures have been abandoned at regular intervals over most of the twentieth century. In the 18 months between March 1928 and September 1929, share prices on Wall Street increased by more than they had in the previous five years. Exactly as Keynes was later to explain, people bought shares because - whether or not they thought the prices were already too high - they believed that they would go higher. In those 18 months, the price of shares in Radio Corporation of America increased fivefold. (After the Great Crash, they fell by 97 per cent from their September 1929 peak.) Between 1959 and 1962, there was a fashion for what were then considered high-tech stocks, the 'tronics boom'. To be highly rated, a company had to have a name which suggested that it was a 'tron' - Astron, Vulcatron, Transitron, Circuitronics and Videotronics, for example. The American Music Guild, whose business consisted of selling records and record players door-to-door, caught the Zeitgeist. It changed its name to Space-Tone, and its share price rose sevenfold within a few weeks. As with all crazes, it died out - and investors suffered. Take one example - Hydro-Space Technology. It was floated at $3 a share in July 1960. The price hit $7 on their first day of trading. Their low in 1962 was $1. In the mid-Sixties, conglomerates became fashionable. Many of their shares were selling on price/earnings multiples of 40 and 50. By 1969, their prices had tumbled and p/e ratios were down to a less giddy 10-15. Also in the mid-Sixties, there was a boom in 'concept stocks' where a company was highly-rated because it had a smart idea even if it was unclear how this would ever be translated into income. (This may sound eerily familiar to observers looking at dot.com stocks today.) P/e ratios commonly topped 100. In the early Seventies, the vogue was to invest only in large, blue-chip stocks. In the US, this clutch of favoured behemoths was known as the 'Nifty Fifty'. The fad drove Polaroid's shares to a p/e of 90 and McDonald's to 83. (By 1980 their p/e ratios were 16 and 9 respectively.) Just as the notion of a two-tier market has been so discussed in the past 18 months, Forbes magazine remarked at the time that '[the Nifty Fifty appeared to rise up] from the ocean; it was as though all of the US but Nebraska had sunk into the sea. The two-tier market really consisted of one tier and a lot of rubble down below.' In 1983, there was a rerun of the early-Sixties boom. New issues were the fad. In that year alone, new issues raised more money in the US than in all of the Seventies. The message was simple: if a company was coming to market, buy the shares; they were bound to go up. And go up they did - until they collapsed, by an average of 50 per cent, in spring 1984. Also in the Eighties, biotechnology became fashionable - for a while. Genentech led the way in 1980: its share price almost tripled on its first day. There were plenty of followers. And analysts had to find ways of measuring the extraordinary valuations these companies attracted: some were selling not on price/earnings ratios of 50 (which would have been optimistic enough) but at prices which represented 50 times these companies' annual sales . In the second half of the Eighties, biotech stocks lost, on average, about three-quarters of their value. There were other disasters. Heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard put his name to an anti-ageing cream from a company called Alfin Fragrances; the cream failed to gain approval, and Alfin's share price fell by 95 per cent in three years. Other companies whose shares were fleetingly hailed as the new IBM (not many people knew of Microsoft then) were exposed as simply fraudulent. Each speculative boom has forced analysts to devise a new way of valuing stocks and providing their ridiculous prices with a veneer of credibility. Each boom must have had John Williams and Benjamin Graham spinning in their graves. Keynes would merely have laughed. Cheerleaders for the new paradigm There is an inherent problem in describing Internet stocks as 'overvalued', because their cheerleaders insist that they are only overvalued on the 'old' valuation models, which rely on dull things such as profits and revenues. What, then is the 'new' valuation model, and who is championing it? New valuation tends to be still based on the expectation of earnings and future revenues, but these fundamental assumptions are underpinned by projections about the speed of increase in the use of the Internet and the amount of money that will be spent by both businesses and consumers. It is on these forecasts, or 'guesses' that this modelling may founder. The new valuation gurus are largely US investment analysts and economists. The two most famous enthusiasts for a genuinely 'new paradigm' in values are Abby Cohen, from Goldman Sachs and Mary Meeker from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Meeker, whose $15 million bonus last year was her reward for predicting that the technology sector would continue to rise, has, however, always maintained that perhaps as few as 10 large Internet companies will ever ultimately justify their valuations. She has also warned on several occasions that this spring there will be a major shake-out in Internet stocks, which will see weaker firms plummet. One of the more influential valuation gurus is Ed Yardeni, chief economist at the New York branch of Deutsche Bank. His take on share price valuations is available on his website www.yardeni.com. But you may need a degree in advanced accounting to understand the nuances of valuing shares in the new environment. What Yardenis calls the New Improved Model means that shares are fairly valued at the moment - if we assume that profits will grow at over 15 per cent every year, for the next five years. And this is an average - for some companies the assumption in profit growth will have to be ten times that to justify their current valuations. Yardeni also points out that in older models it was often the smaller companies that had the fastest-growing profits but the incredible technology boom means the highest growth in profits should come from firms with big market capitalisations. The most disturbing fact is that very few of the major investors pore over their valuation models when it comes to the dot.com stocks: one pension fund manager was recently faced with a US counterpart eulogising about technology stocks. 'You've gotta buy them' he said. 'Why?' asked the fund manager. 'Because, because... because everybody else is.' Very scientific. Emily Bell",

Many of the lottery-funded films don't even get a distributor,' says Preston. </p> <p>'All this money is spent and then no one actually sees them, whether they are any good or not. A vast amount of money has been spent; I would say around \u00a330m for each of the three big film franchises that were set up to hand out production cash, and then another \u00a370m at least which has gone direct into production itself.' </p> <p>Most lottery money was granted through the film panel at the Arts Council, a now disbanded collection of appointed producers and film finance experts who inevitably had connections with several of the production deals that they funded. </p> <p>Colin Levanthal of Hal Productions, for example, was a member of the Arts Council panel and his film Mansfield Park , a joint BBC Films venture with US giant Miramax, was one of those to benefit. It received a \u00a31m grant and, while it has been welcomed by some critics, it is hard to see why a commercial project with such big backers should receive public funds. </p> <p>Premila Hoon, the doyenne of British film finance, was also an Arts Council panelist at the time she was orchestrating the film investments made by Guinness Mahon. This company put money into two fairly successful recent projects, Wilde and Shooting Fish , which had also received big lottery grants. Both Leventhal and Hoon declared their financial interests at the time. </p> <p>The producer of the Oscar-nominated documentary film One Day in September , John Battsek, is critical of the funding structure. He believes it is helping from the wrong end. </p> <p>'It is first-time, independent producers who have the hardest time breaking through. These are the people that would like to keep the British business going and who are prepared to risk money on a good script. The scripts themselves, to be honest, will always come through if they are good enough - although it might also be worth making grants to young screenwriters,' he said. </p> <p>Battsek, whose brother Daniel runs British distribution for Disney, believes the common complaint about distribution is a red herring. The wider deals, he argues, will come to the best movies. </p> <p>'On the other hand, it is hellish becoming a producer unless you already have a private income. If you are in the established producers' loop you can just continue to make films without any of them being any good. I don't actually like to think about that.' </p> <p>Yet it may all be about to change. The British public film funding bureaucracy is on the brink of the biggest reshuffle ever. Following the report of the government advisory committee, The Bigger Picture, the various commercial and public funding routes for films are to be combined in the Film Council. </p> <p>Rather less radically, many of the personnel will remain the same. The body will be chaired by Alan Parker, the film director who chaired the government advisory panel, and Stewart Till, his vice chair and former business associate, will be a council member. </p> <p>Other council members, including Colin Leventhal, will transfer directly from the dissolved Arts Council film panel. </p> <p>Tina MacFarling of the Film Council emphasises that many of the strategies for organising funding may be changed, but she defended the history of the lottery awards. </p> <p>'When this money was given to the industry it was not thought it should be given direct to film projects, it was just for capital projects. This was because they wanted to create some sort of continuity, so that producers did not have to keep starting afresh,' MacFarling says. </p> <p>The industry analyst, Mark Smith of Film Digest , sees the problem with inter-connecting deals as intractable. </p> <p>'It is a very, very small industry in this country,' he says. 'The companies making these films employ four or five people only, so everyone always knows everyone else. Having said that, there is no shortage of people who want to break into it and can't.' </p> <p>The low takings in British cinemas for many of these films do not reflect the total income since, as Smith points out, recently British films have made more in France than they have here. The sums also exclude eventual returns for TV screenings and video and DVD sales. </p> <p>The low taking figures simply show that British audiences did not come to see these lottery-funded films. Why? Well, Smith suspects that the old industry rule of thumb that if you made 10 films, one of them would pay for the other nine has now been distorted. Public money has brought dodgy projects forward and lengthened the odds still further in a risky business. </p> <p>Smith's colleague, David Hancock, adds that across Europe, public film funding is being withdrawn. </p> <p>'I would like to see the method of repaying public investors improved here, too. The problem is that they are often the last in the chain to recoup when a film goes into profit.' </p> <p>And of course there have been relative box-office successes. The acclaimed Mike Leigh film Topsy Turvy had a grant, so did The Ideal Husband , Hilary and Jackie , Hideous Kinky , The Land Girls and Plunkett and Macleane. There have been true critical successes too. Films like Sara Sugarman's Ratcatcher of last year, which would not have been made without the lottery. But Ratcatcher is the exception. It might have been better if The Secret Laughter of Women had remained a secret -and the same can be said for many others on the lottery funding list. </p> <p>Remember these?</p> <p><strong> The Lost Son</strong> <br><strong>Starring Daniel Auteuil and Katrin Cartlidge, 1999</strong> <br><strong> Summary: </strong>A French detective (Daniel Auteuil) working in London is hired to find the missing 30-year-old son of a wealthy couple.

Most lottery money was granted through the film panel at the Arts Council, a now disbanded collection of appointed producers and film finance experts who inevitably had connections with several of the production deals that they funded. Colin Levanthal of Hal Productions, for example, was a member of the Arts Council panel and his film Mansfield Park , a joint BBC Films venture with US giant Miramax, was one of those to benefit. It received a \u00a31m grant and, while it has been welcomed by some critics, it is hard to see why a commercial project with such big backers should receive public funds. Premila Hoon, the doyenne of British film finance, was also an Arts Council panelist at the time she was orchestrating the film investments made by Guinness Mahon. This company put money into two fairly successful recent projects, Wilde and Shooting Fish , which had also received big lottery grants. Both Leventhal and Hoon declared their financial interests at the time. The producer of the Oscar-nominated documentary film One Day in September , John Battsek, is critical of the funding structure. He believes it is helping from the wrong end. 'It is first-time, independent producers who have the hardest time breaking through. These are the people that would like to keep the British business going and who are prepared to risk money on a good script. The scripts themselves, to be honest, will always come through if they are good enough - although it might also be worth making grants to young screenwriters,' he said. Battsek, whose brother Daniel runs British distribution for Disney, believes the common complaint about distribution is a red herring. The wider deals, he argues, will come to the best movies. 'On the other hand, it is hellish becoming a producer unless you already have a private income. If you are in the established producers' loop you can just continue to make films without any of them being any good. I don't actually like to think about that.' Yet it may all be about to change. The British public film funding bureaucracy is on the brink of the biggest reshuffle ever. Following the report of the government advisory committee, The Bigger Picture, the various commercial and public funding routes for films are to be combined in the Film Council. Rather less radically, many of the personnel will remain the same. The body will be chaired by Alan Parker, the film director who chaired the government advisory panel, and Stewart Till, his vice chair and former business associate, will be a council member. Other council members, including Colin Leventhal, will transfer directly from the dissolved Arts Council film panel. Tina MacFarling of the Film Council emphasises that many of the strategies for organising funding may be changed, but she defended the history of the lottery awards. 'When this money was given to the industry it was not thought it should be given direct to film projects, it was just for capital projects. This was because they wanted to create some sort of continuity, so that producers did not have to keep starting afresh,' MacFarling says. The industry analyst, Mark Smith of Film Digest , sees the problem with inter-connecting deals as intractable. 'It is a very, very small industry in this country,' he says. 'The companies making these films employ four or five people only, so everyone always knows everyone else. Having said that, there is no shortage of people who want to break into it and can't.' The low takings in British cinemas for many of these films do not reflect the total income since, as Smith points out, recently British films have made more in France than they have here. The sums also exclude eventual returns for TV screenings and video and DVD sales. The low taking figures simply show that British audiences did not come to see these lottery-funded films. Why? Well, Smith suspects that the old industry rule of thumb that if you made 10 films, one of them would pay for the other nine has now been distorted. Public money has brought dodgy projects forward and lengthened the odds still further in a risky business. Smith's colleague, David Hancock, adds that across Europe, public film funding is being withdrawn. 'I would like to see the method of repaying public investors improved here, too. The problem is that they are often the last in the chain to recoup when a film goes into profit.' And of course there have been relative box-office successes. The acclaimed Mike Leigh film Topsy Turvy had a grant, so did The Ideal Husband , Hilary and Jackie , Hideous Kinky , The Land Girls and Plunkett and Macleane. There have been true critical successes too. Films like Sara Sugarman's Ratcatcher of last year, which would not have been made without the lottery. But Ratcatcher is the exception. It might have been better if The Secret Laughter of Women had remained a secret -and the same can be said for many others on the lottery funding list. Remember these? The Lost Son Starring Daniel Auteuil and Katrin Cartlidge, 1999 Summary: A French detective (Daniel Auteuil) working in London is hired to find the missing 30-year-old son of a wealthy couple. The film was based on Eric Leclere's 1995 original screenplay written in collaboration with his wife, Margaret.Directed by: Chris Menges, Scala Productions. Review: The Observer Peter Preston: 'This, in essence, is a stylish French film noir translated to NW5.' The Guardian Peter Bradshaw: 'It ends with absurd violence and melodrama, and the paedophilia motif looks tacky and dubious.' Lottery grant: \u00a32,300,000 UK takings: \u00a349,302 Downtime Starring Paul McGann, 1998 Summary: A thriller set in a lift shaft in rain-lashed tower block in Newcastle. While the cops and crowds congregate below, former police psychologist Rob tries to coax a potential suicide in from the ledge. Directed by Bharat Nalluri, in his second feature Review: Variety 'If the script had remained centred on the apartment block through to the end -- and developed loose ends like the roaming gang members, the character of Kevin and the poorly written Jimmy (which squanders Georgeson's talents) -- the movie could have laid claim to being a successful genre-bender. As it is, it's a game try...'

      "body": "<p>It is not only working long hours that can damage your health. Employees who usually have to work at speed, or who are always rushing to meet tight deadlines, are about twice as likely to fall ill because of their work as those who work at a more leisurely pace, according to new Cambridge University research released exclusively to The Observer. </p> <p>This startling statistic is based on an analysis of data from the European Survey on Working Conditions, an ongoing study of 1,000 employees in each European Union country by Dr Brendan Burchell, lecturer in social and political sciences at Cambridge University. </p> <p> Take backache, for example. Dr Burchell's figures show that 40 per cent of staff working at speed for all or almost all of their time suffer from work-related back pain, compared with just 23 per cent of those who work at speed for a quarter of their time or less. </p> <p> Staff who regularly face tight deadlines are also more likely to be affected. Burchell calculates that 37 per cent of those who work to tight deadlines all or most of the time are affected by backache caused by their job, compared with 25 per cent of those who work to tight deadlines for a quarter of their time or less. </p> <p> The same pattern is repeated across 14 other physical and mental health problems, including headaches, stomach pains, sleeping difficulties, fatigue, allergies, ear and eye disorders and skin complaints. </p> <p> And the illnesses linked to hard work are by no means trivial: heart disease is also twice as common among those regularly working at high speed or to tight deadlines. </p> <p> 'Continual pressure on employees takes its toll,' says Burchell. 'We used to think that work kept us healthy and that the unemployed were the ones with problems. Now this situation seems to be reversing, and overwork is a major cause of sickness. Even if people enjoy working intensively, it can still be depleting them physically and can affect their health.' </p> <p> What is especially worrying about this data is that more and more employees are now expected to work harder and harder. This problem extends way beyond call centres, now notorious for their intensive working practices. </p> <p> Two-thirds of UK employees say that, over the past five years, they have experienced an increase in the speed of work and the effort they put into their jobs, according to Joseph Rowntree Foundation research published last year.</p> <p> In a survey of over 800 managers at all levels published last month by the Institute of Management (IM), 69 per cent of respondents reported an increased workload over the past 12 months. The research found that the prime cause of stress for managers was time pressure and deadlines. </p> <p> The European Survey on Working Conditions data also shows that British workers now top the EU list ranking the proportion having to work to tight deadlines all or most of the time. </p> <p> 'The single greatest cause of this work intensification is that employers are downsizing but expecting the remaining workforce to do as much work as before,' says Dr Burchell. 'In the public sector this has been caused by governments trying to reduce expenditure. In the private sector it has been driven by global competition, mergers and takeovers.' </p> <p> Not everyone agrees that downsizing automatically results in heavier workloads, however. Diane Sinclair, policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, believes 'an increase in intensity where employees are trained to cope isn't necessarily going to be detrimental'. </p> <p> Sinclair also remains sceptical about the argument that work is generally becoming increasingly intensive because 'there's little evidence to show that we're becoming more dissatisfied at work'. </p> <p> However widespread it might be, work intensification can be a difficult problem to tackle because, unlike working hours, it is difficult to quantify. But organisations that fail to act could face expensive compensation claims, as in the case of social worker John Walker.

      "bodyText": "It is not only working long hours that can damage your health. Employees who usually have to work at speed, or who are always rushing to meet tight deadlines, are about twice as likely to fall ill because of their work as those who work at a more leisurely pace, according to new Cambridge University research released exclusively to The Observer. This startling statistic is based on an analysis of data from the European Survey on Working Conditions, an ongoing study of 1,000 employees in each European Union country by Dr Brendan Burchell, lecturer in social and political sciences at Cambridge University. Take backache, for example. Dr Burchell's figures show that 40 per cent of staff working at speed for all or almost all of their time suffer from work-related back pain, compared with just 23 per cent of those who work at speed for a quarter of their time or less. Staff who regularly face tight deadlines are also more likely to be affected. Burchell calculates that 37 per cent of those who work to tight deadlines all or most of the time are affected by backache caused by their job, compared with 25 per cent of those who work to tight deadlines for a quarter of their time or less. The same pattern is repeated across 14 other physical and mental health problems, including headaches, stomach pains, sleeping difficulties, fatigue, allergies, ear and eye disorders and skin complaints. And the illnesses linked to hard work are by no means trivial: heart disease is also twice as common among those regularly working at high speed or to tight deadlines. 'Continual pressure on employees takes its toll,' says Burchell. 'We used to think that work kept us healthy and that the unemployed were the ones with problems. Now this situation seems to be reversing, and overwork is a major cause of sickness. Even if people enjoy working intensively, it can still be depleting them physically and can affect their health.' What is especially worrying about this data is that more and more employees are now expected to work harder and harder. This problem extends way beyond call centres, now notorious for their intensive working practices. Two-thirds of UK employees say that, over the past five years, they have experienced an increase in the speed of work and the effort they put into their jobs, according to Joseph Rowntree Foundation research published last year. In a survey of over 800 managers at all levels published last month by the Institute of Management (IM), 69 per cent of respondents reported an increased workload over the past 12 months. The research found that the prime cause of stress for managers was time pressure and deadlines. The European Survey on Working Conditions data also shows that British workers now top the EU list ranking the proportion having to work to tight deadlines all or most of the time. 'The single greatest cause of this work intensification is that employers are downsizing but expecting the remaining workforce to do as much work as before,' says Dr Burchell. 'In the public sector this has been caused by governments trying to reduce expenditure. In the private sector it has been driven by global competition, mergers and takeovers.' Not everyone agrees that downsizing automatically results in heavier workloads, however. Diane Sinclair, policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, believes 'an increase in intensity where employees are trained to cope isn't necessarily going to be detrimental'. Sinclair also remains sceptical about the argument that work is generally becoming increasingly intensive because 'there's little evidence to show that we're becoming more dissatisfied at work'. However widespread it might be, work intensification can be a difficult problem to tackle because, unlike working hours, it is difficult to quantify. But organisations that fail to act could face expensive compensation claims, as in the case of social worker John Walker. In 1996, Walker was paid \u00a3175,000 in an out-of-court settlement by his employer, Northumberland County Council, after he claimed he suffered a nervous breakdown caused by the stress of an unmanageable workload. Although the problem of long working hours is far from solved, the Working Time Regulations have at least set some limits. If the Cambridge analysis is correct, work intensification could be the next big workplace problem requiring government action. Don't let the bosses grind you down Sue Carr, 39, was an IT team leader for a leading insurance company. 'The trouble started when the company reorganised and I was effectively given three-and-a-quarter jobs. I told my manager this was ridiculous but he said I had to get on with it. I tried, but it was unmanageable. There were always deadlines to meet and I felt pressurised the whole time. I was also working long days, often up to 12 hours. After a month, I was exhausted. I had sleep problems, and started to get colds and flu and tension headaches. I took three weeks off work because of the stress, and then another-six-and-a-half weeks. Two years later, I was diagnosed as having ME, which I'm still suffering from. I eventually got another job, but sued the company for damage to my health. With the help of my union, UNIFI, I received an out-of-court settlement of \u00a317,000 plus costs. \u0095 Jennifer Hall, 37, is a freelance TV producer. 'I've had to work harder over the years as production budgets have been cut. I have less time to do the job and fewer people to help me with it. As a freelancer, I am also always under continual pressure to look out for the next job. I feel as if I am constantly working. I sometimes get stomach cramps after a stressful day and I have found it hard to sleep when I've been over-tired and thinking about how to get round a problem. I cannot prove it scientifically, but I always seem to fall ill whenever I have some time off. Sometimes it will be a cold or flu, but last Christmas I came down with a nasty case of gastro-enteritis. I ended up in bed with a very high temperature - and spent the time worrying about when I would be able to get back to work.'",

'Very often they betray themselves with a squelched expression on their face, a fleeting glimpse that betrays their real emotion - fear or anger - which is then covered with a false smile that only covers the lower half of the face. It is a good sign that someone is trying to deceive you.' </p> <p>Such vetting is now being adopted by employers in all walks of life, from the military and civil service to political parties, which are screening potential candidates with mounting intensity. 'The problem is not that politicians lie,' said communications consultant Guy Fielding. 'The issue is whether we can trust them or not. Certainly, telling lies is not abnormal. It is common practice. We praise things we dislike simply to avoid causing our friends offence, for example. And politicians are no different from anyone else in that respect. </p> <p>'The real problem is that a person who tells too many lies is clearly untrustworthy. We have no confidence that we can have a relationship, no matter how distant, with that person. There are no trustworthy rules or guidelines for dealing with them. That is what brought down Archer. He didn't even tell a lie, in the end. He was actually caught trying to line up a friend to lie on his behalf.' </p> <p>There were many who warned Tory leaders that Archer was an unpredictable deceiver, of course. Nevertheless, spotting major liars in our midst is an extremely tricky business, for the practice of dissembling is so deeply entrenched in our psy ches and our pasts.

They have not only recorded examples of solitary apes and monkeys hiding food, but have noted cases in which other animals in their troop - realising that some form of deception was going on - began to spy on these deceivers. Then as these hapless individuals dig up their carefully secreted morsels, the rest of their troop will burst on the scene, and attack them. </p> <p>In other words, strategies for deception and counter-deception are deeply ingrained in our genes and the subsequent evolution of spoken language by evolving apemen only increased our capacity to lie, causing problems for the rest of the species.

'When we look at hunter-gatherer tribes today, we can see they live very fair, egalitarian lives, in which food and possessions are shared,' said Professor Whiten. 'Nevertheless, you will always find examples of individuals hiding the odd bit of food.
