      "body": "<p><strong>Liz Jones:</strong> I was employing people to work on Mirabella magazine in 1989 when I first met Jeremy. He came for an interview while he was still at St Martin's [College of Art &amp; Design], so I expected him to turn up with a mohican and tartan skirt, but he arrived in a three-piece tweed suit with a little briefcase. He seemed very prim and proper at first, but underneath he's very funny. At first, Jeremy and I had a bit of a communication problem. He has a strange way of pronouncing things, so for quite a few weeks I couldn't understand what he was saying.</p> <p>Jeremy has extraordinarily expensive tastes. Even when he was a student and was paid virtually nothing, he always bought designer clothes. Even now he will still buy an amazing piece of art made of dandelion heads or a Prada fur coat, rather than pay his electricity bill.</p> <p>We are both into clothes and minimalism, and Jeremy is absolutely my best friend, even though we like very different music. His taste in music is terrible - he just likes Abba and the Pet Shop Boys, and he's never liked hip-hop. We go to lots of parties together. We went to the Puffy concert, and the sight of him among all those hip-hop people made me cry with laughter.</p> <p>One thing about Jeremy is that people do take advantage of him, because he's too soft and kind, and that's the main thing I try and protect him from. In turn, he protects me from men. I'm too soft with them, so he vets my boyfriends. If I turn up at a club and my boyfriend is there with another person, I'll ring Jeremy and cry, which is how the column Single File in The Sunday Times came about, because every week I would either cry down the phone or make him laugh at my escapades, so he said, 'You need to write this down.'</p> <p>He lives around the corner from me in Hackney, and now I'm editing Marie Claire he's in the next-door office as editor of Nova magazine. We help each other out. And, of course, I absolutely trust him. He'd never go behind my back and take a cover story.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Langmead:</strong> When Liz doesn't know people, she doesn't understand what they are saying, so when I first started working at Mirabella we never understood each other. When we go out together now, it's like going to the United Nations as a translator, because she gets nervous and gets this tunnel hearing and vision, and I have to make Liz and her world connect with people in the normal world.</p> <p>When Mirabella folded, we both ended up working at The Sunday Times and eventually I edited Style and Liz was my deputy. We socialise a fair amount together because we still both like pop music and glamour gigs. We have very different tastes in music, so we'll go to Puff Daddy or Madonna because it's an event rather than for the music. Right now it's all work and no play - I'm at Nova five days a week.</p> <p>I'll always be grateful to Liz because she gave me my first ever job, but also she makes me laugh a lot. Whenever I have a problem, personal or professional, I know I can ring her. Liz is very eccentric - kind of odd, in a nice way - so she's always interesting because she's sort of in another world.</p> <p>We are very similar in a lot of ways: we are both quite anal, both control freaks, and obsessed with our houses being tidy and perfect - in a minimalist way. The other thing I've shared with Liz has been her 'Oh, why haven't I got a boyfriend', and for years I tried to find her one. She'd say: 'Oh, I've found this bloke who's quite good looking, can you check him out?' Eventually I said, 'Listen, why not make some money out of it and do a column for Style.' But then, of course, once the column started, she got a boyfriend.</p> <p>For all those years, I couldn't understand why she didn't have a boyfriend. She's so extraordinarily fussy, so I'd introduce her to someone, but if he hadn't heard of one of the rappers she was keen on, then that was it - so I gave up in the end. When she found one, it was such a big relief: I felt like one of those Jewish mothers in a Woody Allen film when the son announces he's going to get married.

Lately it seems the thing that really unnerves are in-laws.</p> <p>Meet The Parents has taken America by storm in much the same way as actual storms have over here. Now the movie is upon us too and, as universal fear films go, this is a humdinger. Most of us know deep down we are unlikely to be eaten by a shark, but meeting one's in-laws is a downer of global dimensions. Confronting the parents of someone you are in all likelihood having regular sex with remains a horror that Hollywood can only hint at.</p> <p>Friends tried recently to milk the scary dad-in-law gag and gave us Bruce Willis, who is to true fear what Peter Cushing would have been to action movies had anyone made the mistake of giving him a vest and a pistol. For genuine in-law movie greatness we must look to Annie Hall and Christopher Walken's demented brother-in-law to steal the scene. But dark as it may be, Annie Hall is a fairy tale compared to what many of us have lived through, or will have to live through.</p> <p>Meet The Parents centres on the dynamic between father-in-law (Robert De Niro) and would-be suitor (Ben Stiller). While Bob pulls all his best wiseguy death-threat faces, poor Ben digs himself ever deeper in his attempts to be accepted. De Niro's character was in the CIA; Stiller's is an idiot. </p> <p>The premise is very funny indeed. Which is dandy, but misses the point that families often aren't. It was Princess Diana who, while on the receiving end of perhaps the most public and grotesque in-law crisis in human history, said that \"families should spend more time talking and less time in front of the television\". Though our other Royle Family's crude harmony seems to refute all that, the truth remains that meeting your in-laws is for most of us the most Shakespearean snakepit of psycho-sexual trauma life will ever throw at us. </p> <p>Everyone has an in-law story. Some are even urban myths. Like the girl who having excused herself from dinner to visit the bathroom finds herself in just that. A room with a bath and no toilet. Too shy to go back and explain the precise nature of her needs, she opts to use the sink. As she perches upon it, the sink collapses beneath her weight. Rushing to investigate, the family are confronted by the dazed girl urinating before them in a pile of porcelain and broken plumbing. If you had a pound for every time that story's done the rounds you could afford a decent sink.</p> <p>In my day, it was a minor miracle and welcome talking point if you dated anyone who had two parents. But no matter how many places are set at the table, it will always be an evening of separate agendas. Forget the generation gap, this is the perception canyon. This is not Seven Brides For Seven Brothers; this is When Families Collide. You foresee an uncomfortable evening, while in their minds they are feeding a sex criminal. They smell treachery and kidnap. They think you are an idiot. That's just the way it goes. There are exceptions of course, but people tend to marry them. A poll of my own half-buried remembrances and those closest to me unearthed a catalogue of mishaps, mind-games and outright horror that laid all fiction to waste.</p> <p>My own de facto mother-in-law and I were on very different schedules during her and her second husband's month-long stopover in our tiny flat. As I would return in the early morning from a night of being young, she would emerge vengeful from the restless sleep of the elderly. \"I lived through the war!\" was her 6am catchphrase. \"First the Nazis, and now you!\" </p> <p>On one occasion, myself and an associate consumed a bottle of Scotch intended for her husband. To defuse the row I made a pass at her and the room did indeed fall silent. On the one occasion I didn't wake her up, I forgot she was there and got into bed with her (an in-law classic). Somehow we remain the best of friends.</p> <p>On a visit to my beloved's homeland, I made the acquaintance of her gay father, then ensconced for reasons of his own in a cabin just south of the Arctic circle. </p> <p>One morning before breakfast he suggested we should take a walk in the woods. Five hours later as the sun went down we were still walking. I begged him to get us out, build a snow hole, anything to help us through the Arctic night. He just smiled and walked us back to civilisation with minutes to spare. By saying nothing, he was of course saying several very profound things at once. He may have abandoned heterosexuality, he may live a long way away, but in my mind he is very much her father. And I am an idiot.</p> <p>The first person I asked for a story came up with this beauty. Leaving his girlfriend's bedroom he is confronted by a snide remark from her habitually drunken dad, who is sitting by the fire. Not being one to take such things lying down, he attacks the father, both men become drenched in supermarket whisky and burst into flame. She moves out. I didn't ask anyone else.</p> <p>All of which neatly ignores those times when things run smoothly, just as such amusing anecdotes fail to address all those girlfriends and boyfriends who genuinely needed saving from truly bad parents.

Add to that the fact that many of us will have to suffer as parents what we once went through as children and it's clear what a miracle it is that the human race abides marriage and family at all. The fact that we survive these things, let alone make comedy blockbusters about them, is testament to the adaptability and courage of the species.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I always preferred Wonder Woman in her Diana Prince army secretary disguise. A sparkling pair of green cat's eyes peering out starchily from behind librarian's glasses - how sexy was that? The only frisson to be had from Wonder Woman herself was the tiny scar on Lynda Carter's upper lip (which showed up better in red lipstick) and the moment when she had to sneak off behind a rock and transform herself into the superheroine. The moment happened in a clap of thunder and a frantic whizz round and was so obviously a metaphor for masturbation, even though her final look - the red boob tube, the stars and stripes hot pants - was not a patch on the lingerie section of the Freeman's catalogue.</p> <p>Les Daniels' Wonder Woman, The Complete History - brought out to celebrate Wonder Woman's 60th birthday - adds an interesting dimension to the story. If you were looking for masturbatory fantasies, then Wonder Woman of the early 1940s was where it was at.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Wonder Woman of the time had thighs like a rugby player, the comic was accused of inciting men to immorality. In virtually every issue there was a page devoted to Wonder Woman wearing bondage - her little red boots chained to her bullet-proof bracelets in some dungeon, Wonder Woman tying up a new breed of baddie Amazon with her magic girdle, that sort of thing.</p> <p>The creator of the comic strip, a psychologist called William Moulton Marston, replied to his critics that he was not obsessed with sadomasochism at all. He insisted that \"women are exciting for this one reason - it is the secret of women's allure - women enjoy submission, being bound\". Dr Marston was a bit of a queer fish. He became a minor celebrity when he invented the lie detector, which he later claimed also worked as a love detector. His machine - with all its black bands and leather straps and electronic pulses - looks more like something you would find in a dominatrix dungeon. In 1941, when the first issue of Wonder Woman hit the comic stores, he claimed that he had created her as part of the war effort as \"psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should rule the world\". He wrote that, as political and economic equality became a reality, \"women would use sexual enslavement to achieve domination over men\". </p> <p>Yet Moulton hid his fantasies well. Wonder Woman wasn't just some leather SM \"top\" seeking to make \"bottoms\" of all of mankind. She was full-on ancient Greek mythology: the daughter of the queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta, who was given life and great powers by the Olympian gods. Living on Paradise Island, where no men were allowed, she came to America to help fight the second world war as Diana Prince.</p> <p>Then, in 1943, a US army sergeant wrote a fan letter to Marston saying that he enjoyed Wonder Woman because, \"I am one of those odd, perhaps unfortunate, men who derive an extreme erotic pleasure from the mere thought of a beautiful girl chained or bound.\" The letter was sent immediately to the head of All-American Comics, who ordered Marston to \"cut down the use of chains by at least 50% to 75%\". He enclosed a list of methods which could be used to keep women confined without the use of chains. </p> <p>Yet the persona of Wonder Woman continued to be radical for her time. Unlike wimpy Batgirl and Supergirl, she had powers that almost rivalled those of Superman. Bullets bounced off her wristbands, she could stun people with her tiara, throw her golden girdle around villains to make them tell the truth and had the ability - although only in the TV series - to mimic the exact sound of another's voice. </p> <p>In the late 60s, a scriptwriter called Dennis O'Neil decided to strip her of her mortal powers and make her a regular, promiscuous Mary Quant chick around town, \"in keeping with the feminist agenda of the day\". The cover of the first \"liberated\" Wonder Woman comic shows Diana Prince out of her army duds, parading around in a mini dress against a backdrop of purple psychedelic swirls and a sinister-looking gay hairdresser in love beads doing her hair. But whereas in the UK Diana Rigg in her kinky outfits was going great guns, the American audience disliked the swinging 60s Wonder Woman. She was turned back into the all-American pin-up.</p> <p>And then came Lynda Carter. The first TV series, shown on ABC in 1975, was set in the 40s during a glamorised version of the second world war. Carter, now 49, describes it as \"more campy\" than the second CBS series, which was set in the modern day.</p> <p> \"I really hadn't played camp before and they sort of wanted me to,\" she tells Daniels. \"Superman camped it up pretty big and I never really did. I tried to play her like a regular woman who just happened to have superhuman powers.\"</p> <p>In fact, Carter did camp very well. Even the story of how she got the role has something camp to it. Before Wonder Woman, Carter was simply a 5ft 9in former Miss World USA. She took the role because she couldn't pay her rent.</p> <p>One of the campest moments is the episode where she leaps into a runaway car rolling down a hill. With her characteristic look of earnest spunkiness, she puts her red boot down to try and stop it - which she finally does, wearing the heel to convenient flat by the time she gets to the bottom. </p> <p>Carter says she has no regrets. She recognises that WW was \"strictly an adolescent fantasy\" as opposed to a feminist icon. Still, she recently escaped a speeding ticket when the cop recognised her.</p> <p>But life after WW has proved hard. Lynda says on one of her internet fan-sites that she would like to act with John Travolta, Mel Gibson, Emma Thompson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Connery. Alas, aside from a couple of undistinguished TV series in the US, Wonder Woman remains the pinnacle of her career. She now lives in Washington with her lawyer husband Robert Altman and her two children, aged 11 and 12.

      "bodyText": "I always preferred Wonder Woman in her Diana Prince army secretary disguise. A sparkling pair of green cat's eyes peering out starchily from behind librarian's glasses - how sexy was that? The only frisson to be had from Wonder Woman herself was the tiny scar on Lynda Carter's upper lip (which showed up better in red lipstick) and the moment when she had to sneak off behind a rock and transform herself into the superheroine. The moment happened in a clap of thunder and a frantic whizz round and was so obviously a metaphor for masturbation, even though her final look - the red boob tube, the stars and stripes hot pants - was not a patch on the lingerie section of the Freeman's catalogue. Les Daniels' Wonder Woman, The Complete History - brought out to celebrate Wonder Woman's 60th birthday - adds an interesting dimension to the story. If you were looking for masturbatory fantasies, then Wonder Woman of the early 1940s was where it was at. Despite the fact that Wonder Woman of the time had thighs like a rugby player, the comic was accused of inciting men to immorality. In virtually every issue there was a page devoted to Wonder Woman wearing bondage - her little red boots chained to her bullet-proof bracelets in some dungeon, Wonder Woman tying up a new breed of baddie Amazon with her magic girdle, that sort of thing. The creator of the comic strip, a psychologist called William Moulton Marston, replied to his critics that he was not obsessed with sadomasochism at all. He insisted that \"women are exciting for this one reason - it is the secret of women's allure - women enjoy submission, being bound\". Dr Marston was a bit of a queer fish. He became a minor celebrity when he invented the lie detector, which he later claimed also worked as a love detector. His machine - with all its black bands and leather straps and electronic pulses - looks more like something you would find in a dominatrix dungeon. In 1941, when the first issue of Wonder Woman hit the comic stores, he claimed that he had created her as part of the war effort as \"psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should rule the world\". He wrote that, as political and economic equality became a reality, \"women would use sexual enslavement to achieve domination over men\". Yet Moulton hid his fantasies well. Wonder Woman wasn't just some leather SM \"top\" seeking to make \"bottoms\" of all of mankind. She was full-on ancient Greek mythology: the daughter of the queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta, who was given life and great powers by the Olympian gods. Living on Paradise Island, where no men were allowed, she came to America to help fight the second world war as Diana Prince. Then, in 1943, a US army sergeant wrote a fan letter to Marston saying that he enjoyed Wonder Woman because, \"I am one of those odd, perhaps unfortunate, men who derive an extreme erotic pleasure from the mere thought of a beautiful girl chained or bound.\" The letter was sent immediately to the head of All-American Comics, who ordered Marston to \"cut down the use of chains by at least 50% to 75%\". He enclosed a list of methods which could be used to keep women confined without the use of chains. Yet the persona of Wonder Woman continued to be radical for her time. Unlike wimpy Batgirl and Supergirl, she had powers that almost rivalled those of Superman. Bullets bounced off her wristbands, she could stun people with her tiara, throw her golden girdle around villains to make them tell the truth and had the ability - although only in the TV series - to mimic the exact sound of another's voice. In the late 60s, a scriptwriter called Dennis O'Neil decided to strip her of her mortal powers and make her a regular, promiscuous Mary Quant chick around town, \"in keeping with the feminist agenda of the day\". The cover of the first \"liberated\" Wonder Woman comic shows Diana Prince out of her army duds, parading around in a mini dress against a backdrop of purple psychedelic swirls and a sinister-looking gay hairdresser in love beads doing her hair. But whereas in the UK Diana Rigg in her kinky outfits was going great guns, the American audience disliked the swinging 60s Wonder Woman. She was turned back into the all-American pin-up. And then came Lynda Carter. The first TV series, shown on ABC in 1975, was set in the 40s during a glamorised version of the second world war. Carter, now 49, describes it as \"more campy\" than the second CBS series, which was set in the modern day. \"I really hadn't played camp before and they sort of wanted me to,\" she tells Daniels. \"Superman camped it up pretty big and I never really did. I tried to play her like a regular woman who just happened to have superhuman powers.\" In fact, Carter did camp very well. Even the story of how she got the role has something camp to it. Before Wonder Woman, Carter was simply a 5ft 9in former Miss World USA. She took the role because she couldn't pay her rent. One of the campest moments is the episode where she leaps into a runaway car rolling down a hill. With her characteristic look of earnest spunkiness, she puts her red boot down to try and stop it - which she finally does, wearing the heel to convenient flat by the time she gets to the bottom. Carter says she has no regrets. She recognises that WW was \"strictly an adolescent fantasy\" as opposed to a feminist icon. Still, she recently escaped a speeding ticket when the cop recognised her. But life after WW has proved hard. Lynda says on one of her internet fan-sites that she would like to act with John Travolta, Mel Gibson, Emma Thompson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Connery. Alas, aside from a couple of undistinguished TV series in the US, Wonder Woman remains the pinnacle of her career. She now lives in Washington with her lawyer husband Robert Altman and her two children, aged 11 and 12. There, she has become Funder Woman, her chosen causes being the Democratic party and breast cancer. She is also spokeswoman for an American contact lens conglomerate and has produced her own video, Lynda Carter: Secrets To Perfect Make-up. Naturally, in the light of the Charlie's Angels movie, there is talk of making a Wonder Woman film. Names being thrown around include Sandra Bullock, Mariah Carey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Madonna and Kristen Johnston. The time certainly seems right. Sixty she may be, but looking at the lyrics to the TV theme tune, the whole concept remains uncannily Spice Girlish: \"Wonder Woman! Wonder Woman! All the world is waiting for you And the power you possess, In your satin tights, Fighting for your rights And the old red, white and blue. . .\"",

Canvey play Southend in the second round of the FA Cup tomorrow and the midfielder, who formerly played for the opposition and is now their youth development officer, is in demand. </p> <p>He is not alone. Canvey, situated at the mouth of the Thames in Essex only five miles from Southend, have been engulfed by publicity since their extra-time win at Port Vale set up the tie with their neighbours, and on Tuesday, before the club's FA Trophy game against Harlow Town, the strain was beginning to show. </p> <p>In the boardroom, a chat with Canvey's secretary Frances Roche was curtailed so that she could respond to yet another media inquiry; in the three-seat press box the reporter from the Echo wondered how he would fill a 12-page supplement; outside, those queueing for Cup tickets looked bemused as cameras followed their every move. Meanwhile, as his players got changed for the match, Canvey's manager Jeff King told them not to let their minds wander to Southend. </p> <p>\"To be honest, I've had enough of all the attention,\" King admits later, having seen his side complete a 2-0 win. \"I'm not used to it and I've probably had more than anyone. It's tired me out and I'll be pleased to get the game going. It's been bloody hard and it's become a much bigger occasion than I thought it would be. Having said that, I am very excited about it.\" </p> <p>He is not alone. \"It's a great game for the whole of Essex,\" says Tilson. \"It's brilliant there's so much interest, although it has been tiring. I got home from Port Vale at 4.30 in the morning and was in work by nine. I didn't get anything done because the phone didn't stop ringing and I was shattered.\" </p> <p>This is the first time the tiny club have reached the Cup's second round, although they missed out in 1995 only after losing a replay at Brighton. </p> <p>Since 1994, when they were languishing in the Essex Senior League, King has guided them up four steps of the football pyramid to the Ryman Premier League. They are riding high again this season, and if they finish top they will be playing in the Conference next year. But they have never been under such an intense spotlight. </p> <p>\"To think that seven or eight years ago we were watched by one man and his dog on a ploughed field,\" says Canvey's coach Glenn Pennyfather, who like Tilson played more than 230 games for Southend. \"It's been a meteoric rise.\" </p> <p>This has been reflected off the field too. The dressing rooms and boardroom at Canvey's Park Lane ground were rebuilt in the summer, and the \u00a350,000 the club expect to make from the tie will ensure everything else is eventually up to Conference standards. </p> <p>Canvey even have a full-time employee now, their commercial manager Keith Johnson, who took up his post in May. \"I'm trying to make the club more professional off the field,\" he says. \"We have a new programme, match and kit sponsors and the Gulls Phone Line. We will build a new clubhouse next year and will increase the profile of the club shop.\" </p> <p>That should not be difficult: the shop is currently a tiny hut lit by yellow and blue bulbs, Canvey's colours. Recently, though, business for Jan Edwards, who has run the shop for 10 years, has been brisk. Sales of replica shirts, calendars and hats have exploded and videos of the first game against Port Vale, in which Canvey recovered from 4-2 down in the 89th minute to draw 4-4, sold out within days. </p> <p>The chairman Ray Cross credits the club's rise to its \"island mentality\". \"The secret is a brilliant manager and coach and the fact the club works together, we all work as one. We all have our little jobs to do and we get on and do them.\" </p> <p>For Cross that includes selling tickets for tomorrow's match and dealing with a perennial problem for potential giantkillers: where to stage the tie. The debate about the decision to move the game to Southend's Roots Hall continued to rage among the 238 fans present on Tuesday and the club's oldest supporter, 92-year-old Mark Hogg, was not alone in condemning the switch. </p> <p>\"We were drawn at home and we should play at home,\" Canvey's former outside-right and groundsman says. \"It doesn't matter how big a gate we have, but it's now all about money. It's spoilt it.\" </p> <p>King agrees but says: \"Having seen the size of the occasion I'm not sure even Southend's ground can hold it.\" A sell-out is guaranteed and for Penny-father, Tilson and the six other ex-Southend players on Canvey's books, tomorrow cannot come quickly enough. </p> <p>Sadly, as in all FA Cup fairytales, there is a fall guy. Mick Bodley, a former Southend captain, misses the tie through suspension after being sent off two weeks ago. Canvey cheekily inquired about moving the tie to last night so the defender would still have been eligible. A carol concert at Roots Hall ruled that option out. </p> <p>Yet the Islanders remain confident. \"Never discount us,\" says Roche. \"We won't be overawed, so 3-1 to us,\" predicts Edwards. \"It'll be very tight,\" says Tilson, \"but I'll go for 2-1 to us, then in the third round I'll be happy with Man United away.\" </p> <p>The man from the Echo dare not contemplate that.

The FA needs a national stadium for income but with Old Trafford now seating nearly 68,000, Arsenal planning a new ground of comparable size, Newcastle United housing more than 50,000 and Sunderland just under, the idea of a football venue used just for internationals and cup finals is open to question. That said, a new Wembley football stadium, minus the accoutrements, might be the answer at a more acceptable cost. After all, a cut-price refurbishment of the existing stadium of dog-ends would have been unthinkable. The surviving twin towers would then have become as much a monument to flawed thinking as the stump of rusting iron - a failed Edwardian attempt to recreate the Eiffel Tower - which preceded them.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It has been a golden autumn for football books. First comes Tony Cascarino's autobiography, riddled with self-doubt and fears of growing old, an antidote to the parade of false modesty that is the standard footballer's story. </p> <p>Ever since the book's revelation, incidentally, that Cascarino dyed his hair close to contract negotiation time in order to maintain the illusion of youth, it has been impossible to look at older players without the gaze straying to their hairline. This week I spoke to John Collins of Fulham, who must have wondered why I refused to maintain eye contact, so busy was I seeking out evidence to suggest the deep blue blackness of his barnet was the result of doing a Cascarino. </p> <p>This week sees the publication of the Giorgio Chinaglia story: Arrividerci Swansea (Mainstream, \u00a39.99). It is an odd title, you might think, for a book about the man who was once the highest-paid player in the world, scored the goal that secured Lazio's first title in 1974 and wound up owning the Roman club - except, it transpires, that in 1966 he was given a free transfer by Swansea Town, as City were then known. </p> <p>His dad had emigrated to Wales from Tuscany when Giorgio was nine and later the lad was taken on by Swansea when they were in the depths of the Third Division (it is good to know that in the world of football some things do not change). </p> <p>The book, written, without Chinaglia's authority, by the Welsh journalist Mario Risoli, contains an exhaustive analysis of what went wrong in Swansea.

      "bodyText": "It has been a golden autumn for football books. First comes Tony Cascarino's autobiography, riddled with self-doubt and fears of growing old, an antidote to the parade of false modesty that is the standard footballer's story. Ever since the book's revelation, incidentally, that Cascarino dyed his hair close to contract negotiation time in order to maintain the illusion of youth, it has been impossible to look at older players without the gaze straying to their hairline. This week I spoke to John Collins of Fulham, who must have wondered why I refused to maintain eye contact, so busy was I seeking out evidence to suggest the deep blue blackness of his barnet was the result of doing a Cascarino. This week sees the publication of the Giorgio Chinaglia story: Arrividerci Swansea (Mainstream, \u00a39.99). It is an odd title, you might think, for a book about the man who was once the highest-paid player in the world, scored the goal that secured Lazio's first title in 1974 and wound up owning the Roman club - except, it transpires, that in 1966 he was given a free transfer by Swansea Town, as City were then known. His dad had emigrated to Wales from Tuscany when Giorgio was nine and later the lad was taken on by Swansea when they were in the depths of the Third Division (it is good to know that in the world of football some things do not change). The book, written, without Chinaglia's authority, by the Welsh journalist Mario Risoli, contains an exhaustive analysis of what went wrong in Swansea. Inverting the usual stereotype of shirking Britons and obsessive Italians, the main problem seemed to be an attitude to training and preparation that was wayward to say the least. Gambling, womanising, turning up for matches 10 minutes before kick-off after spending the previous night on the Swansea tiles was just the start of it. But, somehow, the moment he flew back to Italy, everything went right, the goals, international caps and zillions of lire poured in. Here lies the answer to the Stan Collymore puzzle. If he wants ever to fulfil his potential, Stan should take off that invisible man headgear he was wearing this week after an altercation in a night-club, get a few numbers off Benito Carbone and head off to Italy - pronto.

      "body": "<p>N ever a day goes by, Alan Ball is fond of saying, without somebody, somewhere, reminding him about winning the World Cup in 1966. And, if anyone ever forgets, Ball is not slow to remind them to remind him. This week, at the home of corporate entertaining, Lord's cricket ground, Ball launched another aide- m\u00e9moire to those who might have put that July day nearly 35 years ago to the back of their mind. At an annual fee of \u00a31,966, the 1966 World Cup winners sporting club will allow up to 1,966 members to rub shoulders - at sporting events, at dinners, at race meetings - with the great men who captured the Jules Rimet trophy all that time ago, or at least those who are still around. </p> <p>\"As a nation I don't think we salute our heroes sufficiently,\" says Jimmy Tarbuck, the club's first honorary member, who was guest speaker at the launch of Ball's brainchild. \"Bobby Moore was scandalously ignored during his lifetime. I remember I once asked an FA high-up why Moore wasn't used as an ambassador for the English game. And you know what he said? 'Oh, we can't take him anywhere, everyone would want to talk to him.'\" </p> <p>Indeed it is a strange oddity about 1966 that it has taken so long for the players to be in a position to exploit their celebrity. Moore - whose image, being carried aloft on his team-mates' shoulders, is used as the club's logo - died long before being a World Cup winner was a passport to financial security. In the years before he died in 1993 the greatest captain in the English game was scrabbling round for a living as a match analyst on local radio and as sports editor of the Sunday Sport. Now being a World Cup winner is a career in itself. </p> <p>\"It is quite amazing how it has taken off, I'd say in the last five years,\" says Ray Wilson, the team's left-back. \"In the early days I'd never get that much attention. Now I get invites from all over to do this and that. I've retired now but this could be a full-time job. I really enjoy it. You could say I revel in it.\" </p> <p>And Wilson, who spent his footballing afterlife as an undertaker, is probably the least in demand of the winning team. \"I've always tended to keep a low profile,\" he says, standing in a corner of the room as Ball conducts several television interviews at once. \"The after- dinners are not my scene, frankly I'm not very good at that. But big Jack [Charlton], he's the king is big Jack. The reason he couldn't be here today is that he's probably at a function that was booked a year, 18 months back.\" </p> <p>Now the 10 surviving members of the team, together with the 11 other squad members, have taken advantage of the huge boom in sports-based business entertaining to sell themselves as a brand. There is, they believe, a huge demand to watch football, cricket and racing while paying for the company of the boys of '66, though presumably there will be more of a premium on attending the first day of the Ashes Test at Lord's with Jack Charlton than, say, watching Derby against Coventry after lunch with John Connelly. </p> <p> W hat these former players are doing is taking advantage of their growing celebrity to earn the kind of money few of them enjoyed at the time, and quite right too. Margaret Thatcher charges \u00a3500 for a photograph with an adoring fan, and there are many who would suggest that these guys did more for the nation than she ever did. And the great good fortune for the class of '66 is that their victory has not been matched; the ever-lengthening gap makes their achievement all the more marketable. </p> <p>\"Obviously if our boys had won it since it would be different,\" says Wilson \"but we're the ones still here, we're the ones who did it and, to be honest, it doesn't look like anyone else English is going to win it for quite some time.\" </p> <p>What has shaken Wilson recently is not so much the financial possibilities now opening up, as the emotional resonance that still lingers around the team. </p> <p>\"It's been quite amazing and here's the proof of it,\" he says. \"We all went on this cruise in the summer and what was amazing to all of us was how much it still meant to the people we met and how they had no problems in showing it.

      "body": "<p>After nine years behind the tiller of the good ship Coventry City the chairman Bryan Richardson believes he has become an expert at differentiating between the odd patch of choppy water and the signs of an impending iceberg. </p> <p>Despite six defeats in seven Premiership games he insists this is not an occasion to man the lifeboats. And, with the certainty of a nautical man, he predicts calmer waters ahead, given the conditions crucial to both mariners and footballers, a bit of good fortune and a sail full of wind.</p> <p>Richardson, who in times like these, sees his job as steadying the ship, says: \"The mood is surprisingly good. You would expect me to say that but, having been round this little block a few times before, you get to recognise the signs when it is serious. The atmosphere is not quite right and people can't quite look you in the eye. There's none of that at the moment.\"</p> <p>At most other clubs there would probably be a cry of man overboard or, more precisely, manager overboard. Chelsea cast Gianluca Vialli adrift after five games this season because they feared they would again miss out on a Champions League place. Bradford's chairman Geoffrey Richmond fired Chris Hutchings after 12.</p> <p>The Coventry manager Gordon Strachan's job, though, is as secure as Lord Falconer's, Richardson not even feeling tempted to bring in El Saviour to help him with coaching duties. Richardson laughs at the thought of how a volatile man like Strachan might respond to being told he was to share his office, even if it were someone with the powers of El Tel.</p> <p>\"I don't think he would like it,\" says Richardson in a massive understatement. \"I don't want to talk about other clubs but the Middlesbrough situation does seem amazing to me and I don't know how Bryan Robson can get his head round it. It seems that the Middlesbrough board have lost faith but we haven't.\"</p> <p>Nor, it would seem, have more than a handful of fans called for Strachan's head. \"The majority of fans are saying, 'Hold on, Gordon was the greatest thing since sliced bread this time last year and Sky TV nicknamed us The Entertainers because of the bucket load of goals we scored at home.' So we've all got to show some common sense.\"</p> <p>It is not a quality for which football clubs and trigger-happy chairmen are renowned, though Richardson points out that even Doug Ellis at Aston Villa managed to keep the safety catch on when John Gregory went nine games without a Premiership win last season.</p> <p>One of those games was a 2-1 defeat at Coventry, after which a fan pushed a pad and pencil into Gregory's face for an autograph. According to Richardson, as the fan walked away with the signature, but minus his pen, Gregory called after him. The fan replied: \"Keep the pen 'cos you'll need it for signing on.\"</p> <p>Sunderland have also bene fited, he says, from refusing to sack Peter Reid after relegation from the Premiership in 1997. But it is increasingly difficult for chairmen to hold their nerve when Premiership status is worth millions in TV revenue and when Coventry, like many other clubs, are pouring millions more into redevelopment.</p> <p>Richardson says: \"We have committed ourselves to maintaining our status by spending \u00a3170m on our new stadium, which will have a retractable roof, a retail park, a leisure park and state-of-the-art facilities. It would be a shame to play Nationwide football in that.\"</p> <p>The 40,000 all-seater stadium, due to be completed in May 2003, is, he says, funded independently, so it is not a case of selling a player to buy bricks. But Coventry have also invested so heavily in players that the footballing balance is \u00a330.6m in the red.</p> <p>\"We've spent an awful lot on players\", he says, \"and, though you can go on mortgaging against the future by using next year's TV money, you've got to pay it back in the end. It is difficult enough to run things on 20,000 attendances.\"</p> <p>Richardson, who works full time at Highfield Road, has as accurate a grasp on the club's human assets as their financial ones. Of 50 professionals at the club, he says, only three are over 30 and 39 of them are 23 or under.</p> <p>But he still believes the club's greatest human asset is Strachan. \"He's a football man through and through. After he has coached the first team he goes off in the afternoon to train the kids and he's even out on Sunday mornings with the Under-10s and Under-9s. With the greatest of respect, I don't think you'd find George Graham or Sir Alex Ferguson doing that.\"</p> <p>Sensing those calmer waters ahead, he does not anticipate another finish to the season like that of 1996-97, when Coventry, 9-1 on favourites to go down on the final day, survived with victory at Spurs. But, if it happens, you can be sure that, once again, he will pack a case of champagne in the boot of his car, certain of toasting survival.</p> <p>After all, outside Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool, Coventry are the longest surviving club in the top flight of English football. \"After 34 years in the top flight relegation would be a bitter pill to swallow and I would hate to be the one to preside over it.\"</p> <p> \u0095<strong> Colin Hendry last night completed a loan move to Bolton </strong> after paying to be released from Coventry. The Scotland international, 35, who was frozen out at Highfield Road, will officially join the First Division side on Monday for three months, after agreeing to finance the reported \u00a3125,000 loan fee that Coventry were seeking. </p>",

      "bodyText": "After nine years behind the tiller of the good ship Coventry City the chairman Bryan Richardson believes he has become an expert at differentiating between the odd patch of choppy water and the signs of an impending iceberg. Despite six defeats in seven Premiership games he insists this is not an occasion to man the lifeboats. And, with the certainty of a nautical man, he predicts calmer waters ahead, given the conditions crucial to both mariners and footballers, a bit of good fortune and a sail full of wind. Richardson, who in times like these, sees his job as steadying the ship, says: \"The mood is surprisingly good. You would expect me to say that but, having been round this little block a few times before, you get to recognise the signs when it is serious. The atmosphere is not quite right and people can't quite look you in the eye. There's none of that at the moment.\" At most other clubs there would probably be a cry of man overboard or, more precisely, manager overboard. Chelsea cast Gianluca Vialli adrift after five games this season because they feared they would again miss out on a Champions League place. Bradford's chairman Geoffrey Richmond fired Chris Hutchings after 12. The Coventry manager Gordon Strachan's job, though, is as secure as Lord Falconer's, Richardson not even feeling tempted to bring in El Saviour to help him with coaching duties. Richardson laughs at the thought of how a volatile man like Strachan might respond to being told he was to share his office, even if it were someone with the powers of El Tel. \"I don't think he would like it,\" says Richardson in a massive understatement. \"I don't want to talk about other clubs but the Middlesbrough situation does seem amazing to me and I don't know how Bryan Robson can get his head round it. It seems that the Middlesbrough board have lost faith but we haven't.\" Nor, it would seem, have more than a handful of fans called for Strachan's head. \"The majority of fans are saying, 'Hold on, Gordon was the greatest thing since sliced bread this time last year and Sky TV nicknamed us The Entertainers because of the bucket load of goals we scored at home.' So we've all got to show some common sense.\" It is not a quality for which football clubs and trigger-happy chairmen are renowned, though Richardson points out that even Doug Ellis at Aston Villa managed to keep the safety catch on when John Gregory went nine games without a Premiership win last season. One of those games was a 2-1 defeat at Coventry, after which a fan pushed a pad and pencil into Gregory's face for an autograph. According to Richardson, as the fan walked away with the signature, but minus his pen, Gregory called after him. The fan replied: \"Keep the pen 'cos you'll need it for signing on.\" Sunderland have also bene fited, he says, from refusing to sack Peter Reid after relegation from the Premiership in 1997. But it is increasingly difficult for chairmen to hold their nerve when Premiership status is worth millions in TV revenue and when Coventry, like many other clubs, are pouring millions more into redevelopment. Richardson says: \"We have committed ourselves to maintaining our status by spending \u00a3170m on our new stadium, which will have a retractable roof, a retail park, a leisure park and state-of-the-art facilities. It would be a shame to play Nationwide football in that.\" The 40,000 all-seater stadium, due to be completed in May 2003, is, he says, funded independently, so it is not a case of selling a player to buy bricks. But Coventry have also invested so heavily in players that the footballing balance is \u00a330.6m in the red. \"We've spent an awful lot on players\", he says, \"and, though you can go on mortgaging against the future by using next year's TV money, you've got to pay it back in the end. It is difficult enough to run things on 20,000 attendances.\" Richardson, who works full time at Highfield Road, has as accurate a grasp on the club's human assets as their financial ones. Of 50 professionals at the club, he says, only three are over 30 and 39 of them are 23 or under. But he still believes the club's greatest human asset is Strachan. \"He's a football man through and through. After he has coached the first team he goes off in the afternoon to train the kids and he's even out on Sunday mornings with the Under-10s and Under-9s. With the greatest of respect, I don't think you'd find George Graham or Sir Alex Ferguson doing that.\" Sensing those calmer waters ahead, he does not anticipate another finish to the season like that of 1996-97, when Coventry, 9-1 on favourites to go down on the final day, survived with victory at Spurs. But, if it happens, you can be sure that, once again, he will pack a case of champagne in the boot of his car, certain of toasting survival. After all, outside Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool, Coventry are the longest surviving club in the top flight of English football. \"After 34 years in the top flight relegation would be a bitter pill to swallow and I would hate to be the one to preside over it.\" \u0095 Colin Hendry last night completed a loan move to Bolton after paying to be released from Coventry. The Scotland international, 35, who was frozen out at Highfield Road, will officially join the First Division side on Monday for three months, after agreeing to finance the reported \u00a3125,000 loan fee that Coventry were seeking.",

      "body": "<p>My wife's idea of a weekend escape was certainly seductive. A castle would be somewhere we could literally pull up the drawbridge on children and work. However, an earlier experience had made me wary of barbarian hoteliers whose castle conversions more closely resemble nasty pubs than sumptuous fortresses. </p> <p>Rather than a Victorian folly with crenellated knobs on, we wanted a real castle with roaring fires, a bedroom with a proper-sized bed, heavenly food and power showers. My wife's research turned up several around the country. We plumped for Amberley Castle, not far from Arundel in West Sussex. </p> <p>On arrival, we felt a huge sense of relief. Amberley indisputably is a real Norman castle with 60ft walls built of sandstone blocks shipped from Caen, sturdy towers waving the flag of St George and a dungeon where miscreants or non-paying guests could be cast. It may not have a drawbridge, but it does have a portcullis that drops down when the last of the staff leave at night. </p> <p>We drove across the dry moat and beneath the black teeth of the portcullis into a grassed inner courtyard. Inside the battlements, the 900-year-old manor house wall was a mosaic of suspended flower baskets. The lawns were graced by yew and cypress topiary and flanked by pretty flower beds, and the adjacent ruins would provide a perfect setting for meditations on the art of ageing gracefully. </p> <p>Our room was in the south tower, which had been added in 1377 along with the ramparts as fortification against French pirates and marauding peasants. All the hotel's rooms, we discovered, were named after Sussex castles and ours, Pevensey, had a leaded window deeply recessed into the sandstone wall and overlooking the moat. A rear door in the bathroom opened on to a stone spiral staircase that led up on to the ramparts. </p> <p>We crept upstairs to the lichen-stained battlements. In the 14th century, a village girl named Emily had thrown herself and her baby to their deaths from this wall, spurned by the bishop who had fathered her son (the bodies were found buried in the adjacent vicarage by a BT cable layer). </p> <p>A castle needs a ghost, particularly if it's to attract the Americans, and Amberley, with a consummate feel for marketing, would appear to have several. One night when the former hotel house manager stayed in the Charles II Room (Charles once overnighted here while escaping to France), she experienced a feeling of suffocation, as if someone were lying on top of her. And no, she had not simply forgotten someone was sharing the bed with her. </p> <p>We took off for a pre-dinner walk across the marshland of Amberley Wildbrooks. The valley is one of the loveliest in West Sussex, the nature reserve bordered in the west by the wildly meandering River Arun. Often the valley floods during this period (and this year worse than ever) and it takes on a desolate beauty as memorable as when dressed in its softer summer mantle of wild meadow flowers. </p> <p>The Queen's Room Restaurant upstairs was formerly a private chapel and has a vaulted ceiling that was built in 1165. At the far end of the room there is a mural, only recently discovered beneath layers of plaster, depicting a hunt by King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. The room was dressed in crisp white tablecloths laden with Wedgwood plates and heavy silver cutlery. </p> <p>The liver was accompanied by grilled tomatoes, aubergine, a copse of broccoli and roasted new potatoes. My wife chose the oven-roasted breast of corn-fed chicken served with a tarragon and Grand Marnier sauce. Sitting in the bay window, we looked out over the fountain and lawns, watching night thicken and floodlights gently warm the curtain walls. </p> <p>After breakfast the next morning, one of the hotel's receptionists drove us up to the top of Kithurst Hill so we could make the three-mile walk along the South Downs Way back to Amberley. The chalky path cut through a rumpled quilt of wheat and rape. A glider drifted aimlessly above, and to our left a thousand crows swirled like a tornado across a wheat field. </p> <p>After an hour, we dropped down off the ridge into the village of Amberley where flint walls and raised thatched cottages led us to a pub terrace overlooking the water meadows. Late on Sunday afternoon, we found ourselves at Arundel Castle, a vast pile that prompted us to fantasise about winning the Lottery and joining the clan of new barbarian hoteliers. First, we would have to serve eviction orders on the Duke of Norfolk. </p> <p>On second thoughts, maybe we should just book into Amberley again.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Double rooms at Amberley Castle (01798 831992) cost from from \u00a3145 a night.

The chalky path cut through a rumpled quilt of wheat and rape. A glider drifted aimlessly above, and to our left a thousand crows swirled like a tornado across a wheat field. After an hour, we dropped down off the ridge into the village of Amberley where flint walls and raised thatched cottages led us to a pub terrace overlooking the water meadows. Late on Sunday afternoon, we found ourselves at Arundel Castle, a vast pile that prompted us to fantasise about winning the Lottery and joining the clan of new barbarian hoteliers. First, we would have to serve eviction orders on the Duke of Norfolk. On second thoughts, maybe we should just book into Amberley again.

      "body": "<p>Anyone tempted to put some money aside in a savings plan feels safer knowing that financial watchdogs are protecting their interests while performance tables point them to the best deals. </p> <p>But a donation to charity this Christmas is likely to be made based on a confusing array of claims about how effective the charities are at translating donations into services. There is little regulation of almost 95% of the sector. </p> <p>Some charities translate little more than 50% of their income into services and use fundraising methods that rely on highly paid professional staff and armies of paid fundraisers, while other well-known charities claim a 100% record and say every \u00a31 donated is \u00a31 spent on services. </p> <p>Yet much of the difference in the charities lies not in their ability to run a tight ship, but in the way they account for their fundraising costs and admin expenses. </p> <p>Despite the confusion, charities are resisting public demands to introduce performance tables that rank how well they spend their cash. </p> <p>The main organisation representing charities, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, says it receives calls every week asking for lists that rank the performance of charities, but argues they would be misleading. </p> <p>\"We've had lots of calls asking for league tables showing how efficient and effective charities are, but they are so different - the way they operate and the sectors they operate in - that any attempt to establish a uniform standard is going to be problematic and we don't think it will be the right solution,\" a spokesman for the organisation says. </p> <p>A recent survey commissioned by the Media Trust, which helps charities promote themselves, shows that charities are fighting a rising tide of opinion. </p> <p>The survey found that more than two in three people would welcome league tables rating charities by efficiency and performance. </p> <p>A debate last month staged by the trust, and supported by the Guardian, rejected the proposition that there were too many charities, but accepted that initiatives were needed to help people make informed choices between them. The trust is looking at ways to stimulate new interest in performance ratings. </p> <p>Problems arise when, for instance, someone wants to make a one-off donation to a children's charity. There are four major children's charities - Barnardo's, the Children's Society, NCH (formerly National Children's Homes) and the NSPCC - and a host of smaller charities such as Childline and Kidscape. Then there are umbrella organisations that advertise for funds such as Children's Promise, the government-backed millennium appeal that was relaunched last week for a second run this Christmas. All four of the larger children's charities are part of Children's Promise along with Comic Relief and BBC Children in Need, themselves umbrella organisations. </p> <p>Should potential donors give to Children's Promise or spend a little more time choosing a specific charity? According to Children's Promise it doesn't matter. The promise in the title refers to passing on every \u00a31 donation and making sure it is spent directly on services. It says \u00a319m has been collected so far. To keep the promise going, the NSPCC ring fences specific projects to be funded directly with Children's Promise money. </p> <p>Children's Promise can make the claim because the \u00a33m cost of the project so far is borne by Marks &amp; Spencer. Likewise, the NSPCC strips out the overheads usually attached to the projects that get Children's Promise money. </p> <p>Consequently, the \u00a31 donation resulting in \u00a31 for services is only possible after a simple, yet effective, accounting exercise. The Marks &amp; Spencer cash is called \"sponsorship\" and the cost of fundraising, two full-time staff, four part-time staff, printing, postage and other expenses are taken out of the equation. M&amp;S might have donated the \u00a33m to charity rather than spending it on administration. With this in mind, if Children's Promise accounted for its activities like most other large charities it would say that 85p in every \u00a31 is sent to the charities and 15p spent on expenses. </p> <p>The most generous interpretation of the NSPCC's annual report is that it also manages to spend 85p in the \u00a31 on its various projects. </p> <p>NSPCC finance director John Graham agrees that if all the normal costs associated with funding projects are put together under normal accounting practices, the NSPCC services funded by the Children's Promise get 85% of 85p, which means that 72p in every \u00a31 finds its way to the front line. The total would be less than 50p if the definition of NSPCC projects was limited to children's services and stripped out fundraising, lob bying and education costs. </p> <p>Other charities are keen to attract the public's attention with claims that administration costs are paid for by \"someone else\" and therefore every \u00a31 donated is \u00a31 spent on services. </p> <p>Streetsmart was founded four years ago to support the homeless in London at Christmas. The charity was set up by William Seighart, owner of Forward Publishing, who is critical of charities that waste money on administration. </p> <p>It has been successful at targeting diners at the capital's many upmarket restaurants for voluntary cash donations. Diners simply add \u00a31 to their bill and the restaurant passes it on to the charity. The cash is used to buy sleeping bags, blankets and provide hot meals, following consultation with the major charities about what homeless people need. </p> <p>Until this year the charity was run from Mr Seighart's offices and depended on the time voluntarily put in by staff. But its success has encouraged the trustees to expand out of London and this year restaurants in Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow will take part. The move was made possible by an \u00a380,000 donation by Barclays towards administration costs, including a full-time director. Last year the charity raised more than \u00a3150,000 and this year it is hoped the figure will reach \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Like Children's Promise, Mr Seighart claims that every \u00a31 donated is spent on services for the homeless. But like Children's Promise, the claim can only be sustained if the public discount Barclays offer to underwrite the administration costs. Factoring in the costs of the operation doesn't take away from the benefits the charity can bring, it just makes Streetsmart like other charities and gives a more representative picture of its operation. Assuming the charity achieves its targets, for every \u00a31 donation the charity can spend 68p. </p> <p> Mr Seighart says the Barclays donation allows the charity to make even more money. \"It's hard saying no to an offer like that,\" he says. \"The charity was becoming too big for staff at Forward to carry out in work time and out of hours. It was becoming a full-time job.\" </p> <p>He denies that separating out the administration expenses misleads the public into thinking the charity is more efficient than he claims. </p> <p>Likewise, a spokesman for Children's Promise says: \"We are generating seven times the money put into the scheme by M&amp;S, which is a great achievement.\" </p> <p>Mr Graham says the public is confused by the large number of children's charities and the Children's Promise campaign offers a chance for them to club together. He also points out that smaller charities are often even less efficient than their larger cousins because economies of scale are not available to them. </p> <p>Oxfam, which was recently criticised on the BBC Watchdog programme for using paid fundraisers rather than volunteers to canvass passers by, argues that the public must realise the days of volunteers rattling tins are over. </p> <p>\"All charities need to spend money to make money,\" says a spokeswoman. \"The brutal truth is that charities are operating in a very competitive market.\" </p> <p>The charity, which has seen its income stagnate at \u00a3124m in the past couple of years, says it costs \u00a330 for every person recruited through face-to-face fundraising. \"It's well worth it when they give at least \u00a32 per month and very few people cancel their direct debits.\" </p> <p>Charities must spend more, sometimes just to stand still, after a steep fall in voluntary donations during the 1990s. The NCVO says the decline has halted in the past year. But the need for charities to go in search of bolder marketing messages is still there. The government wants everyone to give more to charities. More information about the ways charities work might do the trick. </p> <p><strong>In the spotlight</strong></p> <p>Christmas is a time when many of the 175,000 small charities with an income under \u00a32,000 knock on doors and shake tins often for local good causes. </p> <p>But before potential donors think about contributing they should consider that regulation of the tiddlers of the charity world is extremely light. </p> <p>The Charity Commission, which regulates the sector, says its resources are focused on larger charities that account for 98%of the \u00a324bn income to charities. </p> <p>That means the likes of the Wellcome Trust, Imperial Cancer Research Fund and Salvation Army are put under scrutiny to the exclusion of small charities. </p> <p>The commission is revamping its monitoring and investigations procedures and with large increases in government funding is overhauling its computer systems. In 2002 it plans to spend a further \u00a31m on monitoring charities out of an extra \u00a34.5m grant. </p> <p>But the focus is still on larger charities. New accounting practices mean all registered charities with an income of \u00a310,000 plus must submit annual accounts and reports, which are publicly available. </p> <p>However, 12% of charities above the threshold have failed to send in their accounts for March 2000 as have 5% with incomes over \u00a3250,000. Nearly 12,000 charities showed \"potential concern\", the commission says and more than1,200 cases were referred for further advice or to consider whether investigations should be undertaken. There are no figures showing how many investigations are in progress, but in the past two years 76 charities have seen their bank accounts frozen among 333 sanctions. </p> <p>Deliberate malpractice accounted for 19%of cases, fund-raising problems for 35%and maladministration for 41%. </p> <p><strong>The value of a pay packet donation</strong></p> <p>Although charities such as Oxfam reckon it's worth using paid fundraisers for face-to-face interviews at \u00a330 per recruit, you could save the charity the expense and make regular donations directly from your pay packet. </p> <p>If you give money in the street it comes from your net income that has been taxed. The government's tax efficient payroll giving scheme can almost double the charity contribution of a top-rate taxpayer because it comes from an employee's gross salary. </p> <p> Hundreds of companies have signed up to the scheme that charities hope will become the backbone of their funding arrangements. They reckon it could regularly bring an extra \u00a360m to their coffers each year and significantly increase the in volvement of donors. Donations have been slipping among the under 30s, while the number of householders in their 20s giving cash has fallen from 25% in 1978 to 17.4% in 1998. </p> <p>In response, the government announced this year that the previous tax-free limit of \u00a31,200 per year on charitable donations through payroll would be abolished. It also said the government would top up all payroll donations by 10% until April 2003. </p> <p>Self-employed workers and pensioners without a company scheme can make tax-efficient donations to charity from their gross salary using the government's GiftAid scheme. They need to contact each charity and fill in a form that would allow them to claim the tax back. A \u00a378 donation would be worth \u00a3100 to the charity after it claimed the tax back. But they miss out on the 10% top-up that is part of payroll giving. </p> <p>Also, charities can only claim back tax on GiftAid contributions at the basic rate rather than the higher 40%. Higher-rate donors must reclaim the 18% difference from the Inland Revenue through self-assessment forms. </p> <p>For both schemes, a \u00a310 donation taxed at 40% saves \u00a34. The donation, therefore, costs \u00a36. A \u00a310 donation made through payroll goes to the charity from gross salary and is then bumped up by a further \u00a31 from the government, thus giving rise to an \u00a311 donation which only costs \u00a36. </p> <p><strong>Contact</strong><br>Charities Aid Foundation.

There are no figures showing how many investigations are in progress, but in the past two years 76 charities have seen their bank accounts frozen among 333 sanctions. Deliberate malpractice accounted for 19%of cases, fund-raising problems for 35%and maladministration for 41%. The value of a pay packet donation Although charities such as Oxfam reckon it's worth using paid fundraisers for face-to-face interviews at \u00a330 per recruit, you could save the charity the expense and make regular donations directly from your pay packet. If you give money in the street it comes from your net income that has been taxed. The government's tax efficient payroll giving scheme can almost double the charity contribution of a top-rate taxpayer because it comes from an employee's gross salary. Hundreds of companies have signed up to the scheme that charities hope will become the backbone of their funding arrangements. They reckon it could regularly bring an extra \u00a360m to their coffers each year and significantly increase the in volvement of donors. Donations have been slipping among the under 30s, while the number of householders in their 20s giving cash has fallen from 25% in 1978 to 17.4% in 1998. In response, the government announced this year that the previous tax-free limit of \u00a31,200 per year on charitable donations through payroll would be abolished. It also said the government would top up all payroll donations by 10% until April 2003. Self-employed workers and pensioners without a company scheme can make tax-efficient donations to charity from their gross salary using the government's GiftAid scheme. They need to contact each charity and fill in a form that would allow them to claim the tax back. A \u00a378 donation would be worth \u00a3100 to the charity after it claimed the tax back. But they miss out on the 10% top-up that is part of payroll giving. Also, charities can only claim back tax on GiftAid contributions at the basic rate rather than the higher 40%. Higher-rate donors must reclaim the 18% difference from the Inland Revenue through self-assessment forms. For both schemes, a \u00a310 donation taxed at 40% saves \u00a34. The donation, therefore, costs \u00a36. A \u00a310 donation made through payroll goes to the charity from gross salary and is then bumped up by a further \u00a31 from the government, thus giving rise to an \u00a311 donation which only costs \u00a36.

And yet it's an exciting city to explore, easy and fun to negotiate on foot. It is true that reliable city maps are thin on the ground. But it's fine, honestly. </p> <p>And I found that, if in doubt, I could always orient myself by Fountain Square (though the fountains rarely work), the central, caf\u00e9-filled hub of town whence radiate smart, western-style shopping streets. Or by the windswept sea-front, with its wide, olive-and-cypress fringed promenade, shady tea gardens and quaint, concrete-bound network of stagnant waterways called, imaginatively, Little Venice. </p> <p>But sometimes it's fun to lose yourself. I did so, comprehensively, in the city's labyrinthine old town, which has well-preserved medieval walls. Tucked inside is the Shirvanshah's Palace, one of the city's main sights. It's a complex of living quarters, mausolea plus a handsome mosque and minaret dating from the 15th century. (If you paid attention to The World is Not Enough, James Bond's last adventure partly set in Baku, you may have received the impression that Azerbaijan is an Orthodox country. Not so - its national religion is a relaxed form of Shiite Islam.) </p> <p>When you wend your way down the hill from the palace towards the Caspian, you won't miss the other big landmark: a fairytale, ancient colossus called, with utter romance, Maiden's Tower. There's a boring story that suggests its name means merely that the tower was virgin, in other words impregnable to attack. There are much better versions involving suicidal princesses. Whatever, it has great views from the top and really is impressive - its blank, minimal keep and slab-like buttress give it an almost modernist look. </p> <p>Dotted right round the foot of Maiden's Tower are scenes of terrible temptation, in the form of carpet shops, all of them delicious caves bright with textile treasure. It helps to be a confident bargainer (dollars are rug-currency, and my haggling companions seemed to be knocking the traders down to about half their asking price). </p> <p>Best of all in Baku, I liked aimless afternoons in the streets left from its last oil-boom - in the late 19th-century, when the city expanded like crazy and Nobels and Rothschilds came to make, or increase, their fortunes. These entrepreneurs built street after street of mansions. They may be dusty and dilapidated now, many having been split into tiny apartments during the Soviet era. But they are still elegant, with their frighteningly cantilevered, first-floor balconies that look as if they are clinging on to their host buildings only through the willpower of the great twisted vines that struggle up from the streets below. </p> <p>Those oil millionaires also built an irrigation system for Baku, which means that though the city is slap-bang atop a desert, there are oleanders and olives and pleasant parks in the city. </p> <p>The best sight in Baku, though, is an acreage of spoiled, exhausted oil fields on the shore of the Caspian Sea. The deathly anti-forest of lop-sided, angular derricks have the look of one of those first world war paintings of exploded woods in Paschendaele or Ypres. It's strangely beautiful - even though it's an environmental nightmare. </p> <p>Now there's a new oil boom underway, offshore, and right by this field there's a foreign rig being assembled - called Qurtulus, which is Azeri for rebirth. And oil may mean rebirth for this country, which still bears so heavily the scars of post-Soviet ructions. </p> <p>After all that, it was good to sit and eat. Azeri food is not a million miles from Turkish or Persian - lots of lamb kebabs for my meat-eating friends and for me, a lone vegetarian, delicious \"aubergine caviar\", yoghurt soups, salads with tarragon and basil and chives, and tomatoes to make your mouth water. There are quantities of real, cheap caviar, too. After dinner, you can sample the joys of the Chechen-run nightclub, Mosaic, or toast your friends in Azeri brandy and splendid vodka. </p> <p>Azerbaijan has so much fresh produce because, you see, the country contains not just deserts and oil-fields but rolling hills and lush valleys too. I marvelled at all this fruitfulness in the city's Taza Bazaar, a cascade of higgledy-piggledy stalls selling peppers and paprikas, saffron and walnuts and pomegranates. (Plus nails, screws, doorknobs and strip lights. And, at one stall, a captive buzzard gave me a gimlet stare.) </p> <p>There's a beautiful opera house, too. The Kirov and Bolshoi pay the odd visit, but you can also see works by Azerbaijan's national composer, Hajibeyov, who infused his Romantic pieces with echoes of mugam, the country's traditional folk idiom. Charles de Gaulle stopped over for a performance on his roundabout way to Moscow to see Stalin in 1944, which must be a recommendation. Since the season hadn't started, I opted instead to see a Russian pop star called Zemfira, who was playing the Palace of Hand Games. She was terrific. </p> <p>Back to those lush valleys. I was ferried by tourbus to Quba, a town north of Baku. When you get there, you're in verdant orchard lands where the pretty, turquoise-painted clapboard houses are surrounded by apple trees and vineyards gone to seed, and the roadsides are stacked with buckets of aubergines, tomatoes, apples and cucumbers - a shock to the eye after the miles and miles and miles of satanic industrial dereliction you pass en route over the flat, greyish desert. </p> <p>For a real adventure, I was able to call on the services of my friend with a Neva - a sturdy, uncomplaining, Russian four-wheel drive that seemed able to negotiate any obstacle in its path. Which it needs to, for to venture off the main roads, which are pitted and pockmarked enough, is a tricky business. Plus signposts are as rare as hen's teeth and the maps don't help much. The man with the Neva was a demon at the wheel, and took me south of the city, on the road to Gobustan, where there are all sorts of wonders. </p> <p>When you leave the city, out in the desert are twin mountains where the Zoroastrians laid out their dead to be picked over by carrion. In the lee of these heights we paid our respects at a graveyard for dead Soviet tanks, next to a sad old cemetery for orthodox Russians. Farther on you can visit a lunar hillside covered with prehistoric cave paintings; and there are mud volcanoes, funny old craters that fart natural gas and chuck great globules of mud at you. </p> <p>Beyond the mud volcanoes, and beyond the main road, lies an isolated caravanserai and mosque guarded by a lady with an impressive embonpoint. She warned us that the place was only to be visited by those with pure thoughts. Putting aside our worries on that point, we investigated this Silk Route stop-off, then exchanged pleasantries with two nice blokes who were bleeding and skinning a decapitated sheep. </p> <p>We then spurred the Neva on to tackle a great brown-and-rust-coloured hill, following the route of an oil or gas pipeline (everywhere we went seemed to be following the route of a pipeline). We scaled the final few hundred yards on foot, where we found our very own slurping and burping mud volcanoes. </p> <p>Feeling on top of the world (indeed, I would have been able to see the Caucasus ranges proper had it not been such awful weather), I felt that I loved these scarred mountains, these bruised and ugly plains. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> The <a href=\"http://www.otc-uk.com\"> Online Travel Company</a> (0870 8870100) is offering three-night, room-only stays in the Hyatt Regency Baku, including return scheduled flights with BA from London Heathrow, for \u00a3719 until December 31.

Mary Crabtree My family tried out Earplanes for the first time this year. None of us suffered any of the usual pain and we would thoroughly recommend them, as long as you don't mind looking slightly ridiculous with blue plastic cones sticking out of your ears. Penny Bradnum This week's question We are planning a trekking trip to Nepal in October/November 2001. We intend to organise our own flights, and our own time either side of a trek. However, we would like to arrange the trek from the UK well in advance. Can anyone recommend a good company that does not exploit its sherpas?

      "body": "<p>As we walked home from the child minder's on a sodden, muggy London night, Samuel kept stopping in his tracks and peering up at my face to check this was not some sadistic wind-up. On Sunday morning he finally felt it was safe to believe it. Frankly, there could be no conceivable reason for being in Birmingham airport at 5.45am, other than because we really were about to fly to Lapland and visit Father Christmas. </p> <p>For days he had been studying his Advent calender, and the Christmas cards in the post office window, glitter frost and snow ladled on to log cabin and fir tree. Samuel was born in 1994, and has never seen proper snow. He helped build one snowman, three years ago in Ireland, and it was frankly a slush and mud affair. \"Will it look just like that, really?\" he said. It would, I promised - and it did, but it was a close run thing. </p> <p>The plane crew had also overdosed on glitter glue. None had ever crewed a day trip to Father Christmas before. From the check-in staff to the baggage handlers and the guys wheeling the boarding steps, they chortled, they cavorted, they photographed one another, they put on reindeer horns and twined tinsel around their heads, necks, the crowd barriers, the emergency exits. </p> <p>\"We are experiencing a slight delay before take off,\" the captain announced, \"because we have just been informed that it is snowing on the runway at Ivalo.\" The crew cheered wildly. The children did their best to calm them down, but the crew sang, danced up and down the aisle, organised snowman art competitions and pick-your-own-key carol concerts, all the three and a half hours to the Arctic Circle. </p> <p>The holiday reps conferred urgently outside the loos. Faced with the beseeching eyes and trembling lower lip - and that was just the captain in his Santa Claus hat - they gave in. The entire crew, instead of being left behind for seven hours in the very small town of Ivalo, could also come to find Father Christmas in the forest. </p> <p>Samuel found me tediously childish as a travelling companion. \"I can see something flashy out there,\" he said, as the plane came down towards Ivalo through a slab of cloud. \"Could it be Rudolf?\" I asked, nauseatingly. \"I think it might be the runway, actually,\" he said, pityingly. </p> <p>A small child at the back of the plane shouted that she could see reindeer. \"Sweet,\" her parents said fondly but soon the whole left side of the plane was yelling. And there they were indeed, two reindeer waiting for us on the Tarmac, outside the the endearing terminal building - not a phrase I have ever used before in my travelling life - with a huge log fire blazing in a dashing modern concrete fireplace, and candles flickering on all the tables. </p> <p>The light was already draining away as we moved to the dressing hall, the levelling ground. Young and old, tall and small, fat and sleek, all emerged in inch-thick, padded-bottom, one-piece thermal suits looking equally ludicrous, but certainly warm. In fact hot. Lapland did look like the calendar, but the snow came with two days to spare before the first of Advent. The country was under a frayed sheet rather than a thick blanket. We were 200km north of the Arctic Circle, and there were still shrubs, and running water. It was cold outside, but not atrociously cold at -3C. Not, in fact, cold enough. </p> <p>Father Christmas is a very important person in Lapland. In the 30-minute coach journey from airport to forest, six cars passed us. In the gathering darkness, there were trees and snow, a scatter of cabins, one village, a sign for a husky dog farm, and nothing else. Between winter closing in and the start of the skiing season proper, there are only three sources of employment: state administrative work, reindeer farming and Father Christmas. </p> <p>His industry began as far back as the 1960s, with a small post office in a little town in the Arctic Circle, which accepted letters on his behalf from children all over the world. This year the post office in Rovaniemi expects to handle up to a million pieces of Christmas post, and it is now surrounded by Santa's Village, larger than the original town, with hotels, caf\u00e9s, pink-knuckle rides - including a mechanical sleigh ride to the elves' workshop - and dozens of souvenir shops. </p> <p>The snow is not just pretty: hundreds of jobs depend on it. The Father Christmas market is now considerably bigger than the conventional skiing market, with dozens of operators, and jumbo jet loads of visitors from around the globe. Transun, which specialises in day trips and very short breaks, got in on the act eight years ago, and will send 14,000 people this year, all in the 24 days of Advent. Its days in the forest have to be organised like military manoeuvres, with the plane-load sorted on to separate coaches and sent off to different parts of the forest, so that everyone gets sleigh rides and husky dogs and hot salmon, but not in the same order. </p> <p>There is no Plan B, a spokesman said this week. \"We did have a few very anxious moments - if the snow hadn't come, we would have had no option but to cancel. You can't send people to slop around in the mud all day.\" </p> <p>Once in the forest, the machinery driving the whole operation was admirably hidden. The coach dropped us and went away, leaving a startling silence, apart from the yapping huskies and the hissing sound which meant you were about to be mown down by a cross-country skier. The dogs snapped and quarrelled and bumped into one another. They weren't yet in training, our young sledge driver explained. </p> <p>\"By now we should have a metre of snow, at least. When they are used to it, they can go 50 miles without getting tired. But this year, for so long there has been no snow so they cannot work. All summer I work at all sorts of jobs, and I dream of snow. But this winter is very strange.\" </p> <p>By the end of the dog-sledge ride complete darkness had fallen and the path to the next stop was marked with candles sunk into the snow between the banks of black trees. Flakes of frost were falling, glittering like diamonds where they crossed the light of the flames. It was ludicrously, almost intolerably pretty. The children trudged along the path in silence, stooping occasionally to grab a mitten full of snow too soft and new to make proper snowballs. </p> <p>All sensible children, unless their brains have been rotted by too much Jingle Bells in the shopping malls, greet Father Christmas with a mixture of greed and terror. Samuel is no exception, but in Finland this is a particularly proper approach. Their Santa is a creature of the pagan mid-winter mutated by two centuries of marketing: Finnish children believe he lives high up in the Arctic Circle in a remote valley called Korvatunturi, because that's where a hugely popular radio drama in 1927 said he lived. </p> <p>The winter is stupendously dark and long, and there are still wolves in the forest. Their Father Christmas comes on Christmas Eve, knocks on the window, and demands to know if all the children in the house have been good - and everyone knows of some house where he didn't get a satisfactory response and went away again with his sack. His cloven hoof is not quite concealed under his scarlet robes: his name is Joulupukki, the Yule Buck, a name that still carries the howl of something ancient out in the dark trees. </p> <p>Before he grew a long white beard and a benevolent twinkle, Joulupukki was a huge, terrifying horned creature, demanding instead of giving presents. So when we entered his hot, little wooden cabin in the clearing in the forest, full of flickering shadows and dark corners in the candlelight, it was very sensible to praise the light and fear the darkness. </p> <p>In the brightest corner, between the Christmas tree and the log-burning stove, sat a very large man with a very large beard, a sack of presents and a bucket of reindeer bells. He was also kind enough to keep a large roll of kitchen paper on the wooden bench inside the door, possibly because he also knows about the problem of steamed-up glasses. </p> <p>The grown-ups hung back, as shy suddenly as the children. The large man already had the letters by his side, on the piled reindeer skin rugs, from the children who had written in advance. Samuel's effort was accepted with great courtesy. Each child was greeted gravely, had a beautiful bell - a proper heavy bell, with a horse-shoe nail clapper - on a red and yellow felt thong hung around their neck; had a brief chat; and was given a small package. It seemed indecorous, though mandatory, when each posed for a photograph. </p> <p>The captain watched, yearning. When all the children were dispatched for hot berry juice in the back room, he pleaded for a bell. They were for the children, the large man said. Could he buy one, the captain asked. Certainly not, the large man said - but he unbent enough to allow all the hostesses to sit on his knee in turn and have their photographs taken. </p> <p>The packages turned out to contain beautiful blue braid-trimmed caps. Any little boy who thought they were slightly sissy could discuss it with Nils, the reindeer herder outside by the log fire, a giant of a man carrying a large knife, and dressed in brilliantly embroidered blue wool from head to foot, topped off with an identical cap. </p> <p>Ahead of us lay another walk through the forest, a snowmobile ride to lunch in a wooden cabin - it was somewhere around teatime Lapland time, and somewhere around lunchtime Birmingham time, and a very long time since breakfast - and one last log fire blazing in a clearing in a copse of birch trees. This, for many of the children, including Samuel, was the highlight of the entire day: not the short ride in boat-shaped sledges drawn by reindeer, but a chance at last to play in the snow. </p> <p>On the long flight back, the crew was still singing, still organising competitions, but most of the children slept as if drugged. </p> <p>In truth, I am the wrong source for a dispassionate account of this. I have been so unhinged about Christmas that my family has called me Mary Christmas since I was a child. Samuel carefully considered the long, exhausting day. \"Actually, I didn't not like any of it,\" he said finally. </p> <p>What we remembered, back at home and reading the next bedtime chapter of the Hobbit, was the monochrome landscape, the white snow and the great black forest. </p> <p>When he was asleep, and I went to put the bins out on another December night of torrential rain and unnerving warmth, what I remembered was the fierce earnestness of the guide: \"Of course always there will be snow, there is no question. Christmas in Lapland without snow, it is unthinkable.\" And the fear in the voice of the young reindeer sledge driver, once again disentangling the traces fouled by his team, awkward because they had only been working for a week instead of a month: \"This has been a terrible winter, terrible. I can never remember such a winter.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Maev and Samuel Kennedy went to Lapland for a day with Transun (0870 4444747), which offers a variety of day-trips and longer stays visiting Father Christmas in the Arctic Circle.

Our Sunday outing had begun. We were off to Antarctica. Ice. Cold. Sleds. Dogs. Huts. South Pole. Shackleton. Bold Roald Amundsen. Great Scott. </p> <p>By any standards, we were an unusual mix: 80 Japanese - all prizewinners in a sweet-company competition - and a few assorted Western tourists for whom the next 12 hours would realise a lifelong dream. </p> <p>Even the safety instructions offered something new as the screen demonstration (with Japanese subtitles) showed us how to don polar suits in the event of an unscheduled layover. </p> <p>For the first four hours of the excursion - most of which was a beeline from cloud-covered Hobart to France's Dumont d'Urville base - we could have been anywhere. </p> <p>Aeroplane breakfasts don't come much better (although I'm told it's possible to have an omelette with roast tomato and bacon in the comfort of your own home), but what makes the outbound journey memorable is the opportunity to digest the science and history of the seventh continent as presented by those who have lived and worked there. </p> <p>There were four specialists on this particular flight: Pat Quilty, geologist and retired chief of the Australian Antarctic programme; Polar Medal-winner Syd Kirkby, who has surveyed more Antarctic territory than any other polar explorer; Di Patterson, the first woman appointed to run an Antarctic research station; and Warren Papworth, who knows more about emperor penguins than the penguins themselves. </p> <p>Instead of inflight movies, we were entertained, awed and painlessly educated by live commentaries from our experts and a radio hook-up with the sub-Antarctic base at Macquarie Island. </p> <p>Until roughly 160 million years ago, Antarctica was part of Gondwanaland - and then for reasons that are a bit mysterious, the party was over. It split up into what became the continents we know today. </p> <p>I asked the bearded Papworth whether the scientific bases from 18 nations kept in close communication with one another (yes, safety in numbers), and had they agreed a single time zone, given that they were scattered around 360 degrees of separation. </p> <p>Yes again, said Papworth: \"It's centred on the Australian base of Davis, south of the Indian Ocean, which can be quite inconvenient for people on the opposite side of the ice - over at Mawson we call it Davis Bastard Time.\" </p> <p>A few minutes before noon (Sydney Mean Bastard Time), Captain Dennis urged us all to bring out the compasses we'd been asked to stow. As I placed mine (a US army-surplus job bought in a Saigon market) on the lift-out tray, the needle veered away from north-south and began to spin wildly. We were passing directly over the South Magnetic Pole. Unlike the geographic Pole, its magnetic cousin is nomadic, moving about 6km a year. </p> <p>As I peered through my window to the Southern Ocean below, the outermost floes were visible directly beneath the wing, resembling pieces of a vast natural jigsaw. </p> <p>Then came something that looked much more out of place, a ship. Opposite it, alone on an island of ice, was an orange building, part of Dumont d'Urville. </p> <p>Then we struck east along the coast before turning south over the Ross Ice Shelf, a sweeping gulf more than four times the size of Britain. </p> <p>By the end of these middle four hours of the journey, we had seen crevasses - dark gashes in alabaster-white terrain - rills; curved-wall white cliffs falling into the sea like the folds of a tablecloth; tongues; powder ice; blue ice (even the scientists don't know what makes it so); and many varieties of glacier including drumlins (oval-shaped ridges), piedmonts (those at the foot of a mountain), cirques (hollow cavities on steep slopes) and, not least, your ordinary, merely magnificent rivers of ice sliding into the sea. </p> <p>All this grandeur largely offsets any disappointment at not seeing a penguin, let alone a colony. The reasons are sound enough: to fly as low as you would need to see them well, the plane would have to buzz their rookeries (endangering their equanimity as well as, possibly, their long-term survival) and risk crashing into the plateau. </p> <p>Due to an incorrect flight-path entry in the onboard computer, the first age of Antarctic tourism ended tragically in 1979, when a New Zealand passenger plane crashed into Erebus, the second mightiest Antarctic peak, and 257 lives were lost. The current tours began seven southern summers ago. As the charter organisers are at pains to point out, a lot was learned from the tragedy of 1979. </p> <p>We seemed to glide down the massive gulf flanked on one side by the Transantarctics. Captain Dennis said it was \"one of the loveliest mountain ranges on the surface of the Earth\". As this was his 17th Antarctic encounter, he should know. But for me, the highlight of this unforgettable day trip was the concatenation of frozen cones whose most majestic peak, Mount Minto, soars more than 4,000m above the Ross ice shelf. </p> <p>All too soon, it was time to bank around in a half-circle and embark on the final four hours back to Sydney and civilisation. </p> <p>This is one trip that can certainly be recommended to those who want to spend \"the real millennium\" somewhere different: seats are still available on the New Year's Eve flight to the land where the sun truly never sets - well, not at this time of year anyway. </p> <p>From November to February, the \"season\" for doing Antarctica, the weather is remarkably consistent: outside air temperature is around freezing but as sunny as the Costa del Sol in August (sunglasses are a highly-recommended accessory). </p> <p>Because you won't be putting down anywhere, the journey is classed as a domestic flight, so - sad to say - you won't get an Antarctic stamp in your passport. But, by way of compensation, you will receive a handsome commemorative certificate declaring that you have crossed the Antarctic continent, \"thereby joining the exclusive group of travellers who have achieved this feat\". </p> <p>Think of it: you, Robert Scott and Captain Lawrence (\"I am just going outside and may be some time\") Oates.

I am hungry - time to test out my constitution.\"</p> <p>Sue has been getting e-mail from people who identify with her.

I don't have any practical advice to offer as it's a while since I did much exotic travel, but I did go to Nepal about 16 years ago and had a terrific time. It's an incredibly beautiful and fascinating country and a lot different to India. So hope you have a marvellous time - I'll be following you on the website (and maybe in real life when my kids have grown up).\"</p> <p>Among the advice offered to Sue is: \"When in Mumbai, eat at Vithal's (5 AK Naik Marg) on the street behind McDonald's outside the VT station, and try a Bels with a pot of tea - a snack with mung beans and curd.\" </p> <p>A woman living in Mumbai (e-mailed by her mum in Lancashire) suggested finding Juhu Beach on a good map.</p> <p>Another recommended that when in Kathmandu, where Sue is heading, the Kathmandu Guest House is the best place to stay and the only place where you don't have to give the rickshaw driver instructions.</p> <p>Stuart and Lucie McKenzie wrote: \"Do try to get to Jaisalmer, really worth the bus trip over the desert. Stay in the Hotel Jaisal Castle and watch the sun go down over the desert as the owner does his musical accompaniment to a cool beer. Have the stuffed paratha and curd for breakfast!! Really jealous, have lots of fun.\"</p> <p>We have yet to hear from 18-year-old Milly Newman who is in Vancouver (she has let her mother know she arrived safely). Meanwhile Vancouverites have warmed to the task of giving her advice with thousands of words of guidance. Here is some of it, from Doug Mercer: </p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Jump on a bus and head to Whistler. The drive on the Sea-Sky highway is gorgeous, and Whistler's a cool place (although getting a bit too commercial). </p> <p><strong>2 </strong>Go to a restaurant at The Eatery (on Broadway Ave), in Kitsilano, and order a sushi combo plate. Yes, sushi! Trust me, it's awesome. </p> <p><strong>3 </strong>If you want to buy CDs, go to A&amp;B Sound on Seymour St, downtown, where you'll find the cheapest CDs in the world. </p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Check out the Capilano suspension bridge. A bit touristy, but gorgeous nonetheless. </p> <p><strong>5 </strong>Check out the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia - some really cool artefacts and it'll give you a good sense of the lay of the land and its peoples before we whiteys found our way out here. </p> <p><strong>6 </strong>Catch a flick at the IMAX cinema at Canada Place. </p> <p><strong>7 </strong>Catch the bus on the corner of Granville and Broadway that'll take you to the ferry terminal where you'll then jump on the ferry to Schwartz Bay and bus it to Victoria. Nice place. Have a great time tumbleweeding around, enjoy the city.</p> <p>Daniel Beedon said: \"Don't even think of missing one of the crepe caf\u00e9s on Robson Street. Excellent food, loads of fillings and great people. Go for banana and chocolate.\"</p> <p>Sam Rowbury has made contact from New York, where he is wandering around thinking he's on the set of Cagney and Lacey or Hill Street Blues. </p> <p>He has been getting advice about how to sort out his head - one of the reasons he has taken the trip. Teresa wrote: \"Remember, you're on a trip to see the world and experience everyone's world, so just chill and enjoy. Do not bring your world with you. Stress is a waste of energy on any part of this trip.\"</p> <p>Simon wrote: \"Travel is lonely, hot, cold, frustrating, tiring. Travel is getting lost, panic rising when familiarity is only unfamiliarity - English (both spoken and physical) is non-existent, and creature comforts a dream away. Travel is quiet and excitement rolled together. Stillness and distance combined. Travel is solitary haunting existence experienced. Congratulations and enjoy your prize. I hope it gets you what you want from it.\"</p> <p>But there are also some practical words. Mike's advice was: \"You absolutely have to check out The Peculier Pub on Bleeker Street in the West Village when you're here - more beers than you can shake a stick at, including more than a few from Blighty. Also right next door to Terra Blues, so if you're into blues grab yourself a skinful at the Peculier, and head next door. And if you're into seafood head to the Upper East Side to Mo's Caribbean (2nd Avenue on the corner of 76th Street) - frozen margaritas and popcorn shrimp to die for.\"</p> <p>To read our Netjetters' diaries, to hear them in their own words, see the photographs they are sending back and to read the advice - or send some of your own - go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netjetters\">Netjetters</a>.</p>",

So hope you have a marvellous time - I'll be following you on the website (and maybe in real life when my kids have grown up).\" Among the advice offered to Sue is: \"When in Mumbai, eat at Vithal's (5 AK Naik Marg) on the street behind McDonald's outside the VT station, and try a Bels with a pot of tea - a snack with mung beans and curd.\" A woman living in Mumbai (e-mailed by her mum in Lancashire) suggested finding Juhu Beach on a good map. Another recommended that when in Kathmandu, where Sue is heading, the Kathmandu Guest House is the best place to stay and the only place where you don't have to give the rickshaw driver instructions. Stuart and Lucie McKenzie wrote: \"Do try to get to Jaisalmer, really worth the bus trip over the desert. Stay in the Hotel Jaisal Castle and watch the sun go down over the desert as the owner does his musical accompaniment to a cool beer. Have the stuffed paratha and curd for breakfast!! Really jealous, have lots of fun.\" We have yet to hear from 18-year-old Milly Newman who is in Vancouver (she has let her mother know she arrived safely). Meanwhile Vancouverites have warmed to the task of giving her advice with thousands of words of guidance. Here is some of it, from Doug Mercer: 1 Jump on a bus and head to Whistler. The drive on the Sea-Sky highway is gorgeous, and Whistler's a cool place (although getting a bit too commercial). 2 Go to a restaurant at The Eatery (on Broadway Ave), in Kitsilano, and order a sushi combo plate. Yes, sushi! Trust me, it's awesome. 3 If you want to buy CDs, go to A&amp;B Sound on Seymour St, downtown, where you'll find the cheapest CDs in the world. 4 Check out the Capilano suspension bridge. A bit touristy, but gorgeous nonetheless. 5 Check out the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia - some really cool artefacts and it'll give you a good sense of the lay of the land and its peoples before we whiteys found our way out here. 6 Catch a flick at the IMAX cinema at Canada Place. 7 Catch the bus on the corner of Granville and Broadway that'll take you to the ferry terminal where you'll then jump on the ferry to Schwartz Bay and bus it to Victoria. Nice place. Have a great time tumbleweeding around, enjoy the city. Daniel Beedon said: \"Don't even think of missing one of the crepe caf\u00e9s on Robson Street. Excellent food, loads of fillings and great people. Go for banana and chocolate.\" Sam Rowbury has made contact from New York, where he is wandering around thinking he's on the set of Cagney and Lacey or Hill Street Blues. He has been getting advice about how to sort out his head - one of the reasons he has taken the trip. Teresa wrote: \"Remember, you're on a trip to see the world and experience everyone's world, so just chill and enjoy. Do not bring your world with you. Stress is a waste of energy on any part of this trip.\" Simon wrote: \"Travel is lonely, hot, cold, frustrating, tiring. Travel is getting lost, panic rising when familiarity is only unfamiliarity - English (both spoken and physical) is non-existent, and creature comforts a dream away. Travel is quiet and excitement rolled together. Stillness and distance combined. Travel is solitary haunting existence experienced. Congratulations and enjoy your prize. I hope it gets you what you want from it.\" But there are also some practical words. Mike's advice was: \"You absolutely have to check out The Peculier Pub on Bleeker Street in the West Village when you're here - more beers than you can shake a stick at, including more than a few from Blighty. Also right next door to Terra Blues, so if you're into blues grab yourself a skinful at the Peculier, and head next door. And if you're into seafood head to the Upper East Side to Mo's Caribbean (2nd Avenue on the corner of 76th Street) - frozen margaritas and popcorn shrimp to die for.\" To read our Netjetters' diaries, to hear them in their own words, see the photographs they are sending back and to read the advice - or send some of your own - go to Netjetters.",

But for those looking for some serious New Year's Eve partying, it can offer a week's half-board at the three-star Hotel Sauze in Italy's Sauze d'Oulx with a flight from Gatwick on December 31 for \u00a3369 - based on two sharing a room. Night life in Sauze was so riotous that it became known as \"Benidorm on Snow\".

It also has space in Andorra's Pas de la Casa for one week, half-board, leaving Glasgow on the same day and for the same price. And for those prepared to fly from Gatwick on Christmas Eve, it can also offer a week's half-board in the French resort of Serre Chevalier for \u00a3389. </p> <p>First Choice says finding something for New Year is a little easier, \"particularly if you are flexible on where you want to go since some resorts are full\". For example, it has self-catering holidays in the Trois Vall\u00e9es at Les Menuires, with a flight from Newcastle on December 29, for \u00a3389 and at La Plagne, also in France and departing from Bristol the following day, for \u00a3399. It can also offer a week in Austria's St Wolfgang, with a flight from Birmingham on December 30, for \u00a3479. </p> <p>Andorra and Italy's Cervinia and Livigno are good choices for early intermediate skiers, and <strong> Thomson</strong> (0870 6061470) has one-week packages available to all three.

The holiday costs \u00a3295 in a studio for four. </p> <p>Or, perhaps better, you can go for half-board in Livigno, also with a flight from Gatwick, but on December 23. Flights to Andorra are from Bristol and from Manchester to Toulouse on New Year's Eve.

On my trek, one porter was his friend, the other his brother-in-law. I certainly felt that neither of them was being exploited. All arrangements were made by email or post before leaving the UK, although no payment was made until reaching Nepal, and the cost was less than the rate for similar treks advertised in the UK. <br><strong> Davis Clarke</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Next year, I will be making my fifth trek with Yogesh Tamang. <br><strong>Simon Furze </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Muir's Tours (non-profit), Reading, tel: 0118 9502281 (<a href=\"http://www.nkf-mt.org.uk\">www.nkf-mt.org.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:info@nkf-mt.org.uk\">info@nkf-mt.org.uk</a>). <br>\u0095 The Nepal Trust (Scottish charity), Moray, Scotland, tel: 01343 810358 (<a href=\"http://www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk \">www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk\">admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk</a>). <br>\u0095 Tribes Travel, Suffolk tel: 01728 685971 (<a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk \">www.tribes.co.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:ctg@tribes.co.uk\">ctg@tribes.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>\u0095 For flight bookings, I recommend North South Travel - a travel agency contributing profits towards support for projects in the developing world.<br><strong> Roy Dey-Graff</strong></p> <p>\u0095Every trekker with Nepalese Trails has their own individual porter to carry a bag which must weigh no more than 15kg. With so many porters, everyone can walk at their own pace. And they are very competitively priced. <br><strong> Marnie Sweet </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Nepalese Trails has a passion for Nepal and its people. Their porters have become their friends, and are treated with great care and respect. <br><strong> Cath Webley </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Tenji Sherpa is the ideal soluation. Tenji is one of several brothers who have formed a small family trekking company based in Kathmandu, called Sherpa Brothers. You can contact him at <a href=\"mailto:tsherpa@mos.com.np\">tsherpa@mos.com.np</a> and discuss your requirements. He can arrange everything and in all probability will accompany you on the trek, hence no middlemen. He and I recently trekked in the Solu Khumbu, and largely due to his care and expertise, I had a memorable, inexpensive time among his own Sherpa people. <br><strong> Al Parrott</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I belong to the U3A Travel Network which organises educational and cultural tours for its members. The group has run tours in Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan using a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung. I met Ram earlier this year when I was in Kathmandu and he is knowledgeable and flexible. He uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara and will tailor a tour to suit anyone, and is prepared to organise tours anywhere on the Indian sub-continent. <br><strong>Dennis Johnson</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Narayan Gurung took us on a marvellous trek in Nepal a couple of years ago and we are still in touch. He speaks excellent English and can be reached by email at <a href=\"mailto:lalman@wlink.com.np\"> lalman@wlink.com.np</a>. Alternatively his address is GPO Box 11629, Kathmandu, Nepal. You don't need to use a trekking company to trek around much of Nepal. Most of the main trekking routes have plenty of accommodation available, and by using it you are putting money into the local economy. For the Everest trek, just get the bus from Kathmandu to Jiri, then employ local porters who can be hired on the spot from nearby villages, for wages that we would consider derisory. Try the village of Kenja, a day's walk from Jiri where the Everest trek starts. Walk there yourself or send a messenger. By employing people from the villages, you give new opportunities and much needed cash to some of the poorest people on earth. It's all cheaper and easier than you think; food and accommodation are available everywhere and the route is simple to follow. You just need someone to carry your kit. Get good maps and a guidebook; travel light and don't demand too many western 'luxuries'. Finally, don't be tempted to shorten the distance by flying to Lukla. Walk there instead, it will get you fit and acclimatise you gradually, thus avoiding the potential for altitude sickness. <br><strong>Rob Widders</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I would highly recommend a Canadian trekking company called Everest Trekking owned by Gord Konantz. The company organizes treks through Nepal and Tibet. Gord and his wife Gail are usually present on most of the treks. The Nepal operations are run by Tashi Sherpa, a professional mountain climber who lives with his family in Kathmandu. I travelled with Everest Trekking three years ago through the Annapurna area. We were asked to bring any used clothing we had along with us, so that it could be distributed among the sherpas and guides after our trek. The guides were thrilled with this. Check out their website at <a href=\"http://www.everesttrekking.com\" target=\"_neW\"> www.everesttrekking.com</a>. It provides further information on their community work in Nepal. <br><strong>Ann Pawluk</strong></p> <p> \u0095 We did exactly this a few months ago. We booked our trekking and other activities (including local transport, hotels, and visit to Chitwan Park) directly with Gorkha Treks. We gave them outline itinerary and they quoted all inclusive price. Write to Mr DB Gurung, at <a href=\"mailto:dbgurung@mos.com.nep\">dbgurung@mos.com.nep</a>. We were particularly pleased that our porters were not overloaded at any stage of the trek. This was definitely not the case with some other parties we saw. This was a great holiday in a beautiful country with marvellous people - we can't wait to go again! <br><strong>Fred and Jill Brotherton</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I have twice enjoyed a memorable trekking holiday with Roama Travel of Shroton, Blandford, Dorset. It is a small family business (ABTA registered) whose daughter is married to a Nepali with offices in Kathmandu. This year I trekked/camped alone with 10 Nepalis for 12 days and saw only four tourists. Camping is the only way to see Nepal. Avoid the more popular tea house treks that stick to well worn trails. They have no fixed itineraries, but will arrange anything you like. Intimate knowledge of Nepal and all profits go to support charities and schools in Nepal. Contact Bill Norman at <a href=\"mailto:roama@city2000.net\"> roama@city2000.net</a>. <br><strong>David Patten</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I can thoroughly recommend a local company - Gurudongma Tours &amp; Treks. It's run by a delightful retired Lieutenant General, Jimmy Singh, and is very efficient and also friendly, ecologically sound and very good to all the staff they employ. Also all your money goes to help local people. They operate all over the Eastern Himalaya. You can contact them on <a href=\"mailto:gurutt@dte.vsnl.net.in\"> gurutt@dte.vsnl.net.in</a>, or at Gurudongma House, Hilltop Road, Kalimpong, West Bengal, India. <br><strong>Maureen Blake</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I have trekked in Nepal twice with Richard and Shari Ravensdale who own Five Valleys Treks and run a small charity, Trekaid, which supports Tibetan refugee villages in Nepal. Their sherpas are employed on a salaried basis all year round, the head sherpa is also a co-director of the firm. Prices are very reasonable, probably partly due to using Aeroflot! Contact at 2 Somerset Cottages, Stoke Village, Plymouth, tel: 01752-567617. <br><strong>Pam Scroop</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I would recommend Joanna contact Lama Parivar, Kay and David White, email <a href=\"mailto:kay@lamaparivar.freeserve.co.uk\"> kay@lamaparivar.freeserve.co.uk</a>. They can arrange treks with either full services, or only a porter and guide. We went on a trek some years ago with them, from Lukla towards Everest, and were impressed by their organisation, which is a joint Anglo/Nepalese one. The Sherpas were part of the team, not exploited labour. Kay White is also raising money and supplies for a village in the mountains.<br><strong>Denis Bates</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I recommend that you contact Carl Harrison, PO Box 2109, Kathmandu, Nepal, email <a href=\"mailto:carl@bighills.wlink.com.np\"> carl@bighills.wlink.com.np</a>. Carl has been organising treks in Nepal for several years and specialises in treks for individuals. <br><strong>Norman Hargreaves</strong></p> <p> \u0095 We recommend Nepalese Trails at Random Cottage, Pentre, Llanfyllin, Powys, SY22 5LE, Wales.

We had a great holiday earlier this year, and Barry and Bridget are very caring of their porters, many of whom have been with them for some years. They speak the language and support local schools and other projects. <br><strong>Keith &amp; Pat Williams</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I can heartily recommend Summit Trekking, based in Kathmandu. I trekked with them two years ago, and found them to be an excellent company. The sherpas were fantastic, and well looked after. The company was booked by Scope for their sponsored treks, which is a recommendation in itself. You will find Summit Trekking at the Summit Hotel (PO Box 1406), Kupondol Height, in the Lalitpur district, or email <a href=\"mailto:summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np\"> summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np</a>. <br><strong>Doug Stratton</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I and several friends have just returned from Nepal. We did all the arranging from this end by email with a Nepali sirdar we had met on a previous trip. We too were concerned about the exploitation - especially of porters who often are poorly equipped for higher altitudes and often totally uninsured by the company. These are concerns that you must sort out before going. Our group of 11 people from the UK flew out with Qatar Airways. All our porters were well equipped and very happy! A trip like this (we climbed a peak in the 22-day trek and then went to North India for a week) doesn't need to cost an arm and a leg - our total was about \u00a31,500 and we didn't rough it. Contact Saroj Neupane of Beyond the Limits Trekking in Kathmandu. Email <a href=\"mailto:blimits@ntc.net.np\"> blimits@ntc.net.np</a>. <br><strong>Chris Walker</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Two years ago, after I retired, my husband and I went on a three-month round-the-world trip, which we organised with the help of Trailfinders. Our final destination was Kathmandu. We weren't fit enough for proper Himalayan two-three week treks but we wanted to walk in the hills around Kathmandu Valley. We had acquired our own driver by chance at the airport, and if he couldn't arrange something for us, he knew someone who could. He took us to Galaxy Trekking and Expedition Ltd on Durbar Marg (it's upstairs so not easily spotted). The staff were very helpful and one spoke excellent English. We booked a two-day 'mini' trek to Nagarkot and back, with a night in a small hotel overlooking the Himalayas, three meals, transport to and from the start and finish point, and a Sherpa guide, Sanu Gurung, just for us. Sanu was patient, courteous without being deferential, informative, with good English and a sense of humour. Our outward trek was only for about 4 hours, with a \"lunch break\" in the middle. We'd only put water and biscuits in our small rucksack with basic overnight things, to keep the weight down, though Sanu insisted on carrying it! We have corresponded with Sanu since, and last year he decided to set up his own company - Naturel and Trekking and Expedition(P) Ltd which also arranges safaris, whitewater rafting etc. The address is PO Box 20560, Thamel, Bhagawati Bahal, Kathmandu, tel 423283 and 4116804, fax: 00977-1-423283, email <a href=\"mailto:natureland@htp.com.np\"> natureland@htp.com.np</a>. <br><strong>Janet Blackburn</strong></p> <p> \u0095 My husband is Nepali, and although now living in England he has worked as a trekking guide in the Annapurna region of Nepal for 10 years. Naturally, he is acutely aware of the issues facing both porters and guides and spent quite some time supporting the rights of porters. We would recommend that the only way to really guarantee the fair treatment of your guides and porters is to communicate directly with them and find out about their pay and conditions and support them further if necessary. We would be very happy to offer you any further information or first hand advice about trekking or travelling in Nepal in general. We can also recommend highly experienced and reliable independent guides to you if you decide to arrange a trek from this country without using an agency. <br><strong>Sam and Guru Sharma</strong> <a href=\"mailto:mountaingurus@yahoo.com\"> mountaingurus@yahoo.com</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 I strongly recommend Yogesh Tamang who arranges tailor-made treks.

Pasang takes great care of the local environment, and makes sure that he spreads trekker's income around, by ensuring that money for food and accommodation goes directly to people in local villages. He also pays his sherpas and porters at well above the minimum rate, ensures they are properly clothed, and that the porters carry less than the recommended amount. Porters and sherpas will also eat the same food as their trekking clients. He can be contacted in Nepal on <a href=\"mailto:plama@plama.wlink.com.np\"> plama@plama.wlink.com.np</a> or in the UK on <a href=\"mailto:mcarrott@lineone.net\"> mcarrott@lineone.net</a>.</p> <p> \u0095 We did a DIY trekking and touring trip to Nepal late last year.

Richard Willmott \u0095 Rinzin Tamang (Yogesh) (GPO Box 8974 CPC 289 Kathmandu, Nepal, www.Karmatreks.com, email: yogi-trek@hotmail.com) started his trekking career with one of the well-known companies, and about three years ago set up on his own, realising that a large proportion of the money paid by trekkers never reached local pockets. On my trek, one porter was his friend, the other his brother-in-law. I certainly felt that neither of them was being exploited. All arrangements were made by email or post before leaving the UK, although no payment was made until reaching Nepal, and the cost was less than the rate for similar treks advertised in the UK. Davis Clarke \u0095 Next year, I will be making my fifth trek with Yogesh Tamang. Simon Furze \u0095 Muir's Tours (non-profit), Reading, tel: 0118 9502281 (www.nkf-mt.org.uk, email: info@nkf-mt.org.uk). \u0095 The Nepal Trust (Scottish charity), Moray, Scotland, tel: 01343 810358 (www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk, email: admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk). \u0095 Tribes Travel, Suffolk tel: 01728 685971 (www.tribes.co.uk, email: ctg@tribes.co.uk). \u0095 For flight bookings, I recommend North South Travel - a travel agency contributing profits towards support for projects in the developing world. Roy Dey-Graff \u0095Every trekker with Nepalese Trails has their own individual porter to carry a bag which must weigh no more than 15kg. With so many porters, everyone can walk at their own pace. And they are very competitively priced. Marnie Sweet \u0095 Nepalese Trails has a passion for Nepal and its people. Their porters have become their friends, and are treated with great care and respect. Cath Webley \u0095 Tenji Sherpa is the ideal soluation. Tenji is one of several brothers who have formed a small family trekking company based in Kathmandu, called Sherpa Brothers. You can contact him at tsherpa@mos.com.np and discuss your requirements. He can arrange everything and in all probability will accompany you on the trek, hence no middlemen. He and I recently trekked in the Solu Khumbu, and largely due to his care and expertise, I had a memorable, inexpensive time among his own Sherpa people. Al Parrott \u0095 I belong to the U3A Travel Network which organises educational and cultural tours for its members. The group has run tours in Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan using a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung. I met Ram earlier this year when I was in Kathmandu and he is knowledgeable and flexible. He uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara and will tailor a tour to suit anyone, and is prepared to organise tours anywhere on the Indian sub-continent. Dennis Johnson \u0095 Narayan Gurung took us on a marvellous trek in Nepal a couple of years ago and we are still in touch. He speaks excellent English and can be reached by email at lalman@wlink.com.np. Alternatively his address is GPO Box 11629, Kathmandu, Nepal. You don't need to use a trekking company to trek around much of Nepal. Most of the main trekking routes have plenty of accommodation available, and by using it you are putting money into the local economy. For the Everest trek, just get the bus from Kathmandu to Jiri, then employ local porters who can be hired on the spot from nearby villages, for wages that we would consider derisory. Try the village of Kenja, a day's walk from Jiri where the Everest trek starts. Walk there yourself or send a messenger. By employing people from the villages, you give new opportunities and much needed cash to some of the poorest people on earth. It's all cheaper and easier than you think; food and accommodation are available everywhere and the route is simple to follow. You just need someone to carry your kit. Get good maps and a guidebook; travel light and don't demand too many western 'luxuries'. Finally, don't be tempted to shorten the distance by flying to Lukla. Walk there instead, it will get you fit and acclimatise you gradually, thus avoiding the potential for altitude sickness. Rob Widders \u0095 I would highly recommend a Canadian trekking company called Everest Trekking owned by Gord Konantz. The company organizes treks through Nepal and Tibet. Gord and his wife Gail are usually present on most of the treks. The Nepal operations are run by Tashi Sherpa, a professional mountain climber who lives with his family in Kathmandu. I travelled with Everest Trekking three years ago through the Annapurna area. We were asked to bring any used clothing we had along with us, so that it could be distributed among the sherpas and guides after our trek. The guides were thrilled with this. Check out their website at www.everesttrekking.com. It provides further information on their community work in Nepal. Ann Pawluk \u0095 We did exactly this a few months ago. We booked our trekking and other activities (including local transport, hotels, and visit to Chitwan Park) directly with Gorkha Treks. We gave them outline itinerary and they quoted all inclusive price. Write to Mr DB Gurung, at dbgurung@mos.com.nep.

      "body": "<p>One cold May Sunday in 1807, a Stoke-on-Trent wheelwright named Hugh Bourne climbed to the windswept 335m summit of Mow Cop, on the borders of Staffordshire and Cheshire, to launch the Primitive Methodist movement.</p> <p>Bourne, his brother and his friend William Clowes of Burslem were anxious to return to a far simpler form of religious observance, and they invited a number of like-minded friends to that first \"camp meeting\" of the new order. The meeting is said to have lasted for between 12 and 14 hours, and was the precursor of many similar mass gatherings on this well-known viewpoint.</p> <p>A century later, more than 70,000 of Bourne's disciples gathered to worship here at what had become their \"Holy Mount\".</p> <p>Mow Cop is certainly an inspiring place, with its extensive westward views over the broad Cheshire Plain as far as the Berwyn Mountains of North Wales, north-east to the hills of the Peak and southwards as far as the dark conifers of Cannock Chase and the dim outlines of the Shropshire Hills. Nearer at hand, the huge white saucer of the Jodrell Bank radio telescope is prominent in the broad green plain below. To the north are the tower blocks of Stockport and Manchester, beyond wooded Alderley Edge, and the airliners coming in and out of Manchester International Airport.</p> <p>Our walk starts at the car park near the summit and descends through woodland to the Ackers Wood railway crossing in the plain below the hill, and follows the towpath of the Macclesfield Canal before climbing up to Mow Cop again via the hamlet of Mount Pleasant.</p> <p>The mock-gothic folly castle that tops the hill was built in 1754 by the local squire, Randle Wilbraham, to adorn the eastern skyline as seen from his home three miles to the west at Rode Hall. The folly takes the form of a two-storey circular tower alongside a gothic-arched curtain wall.</p> <p>Earlier, the hilltop of Mow Cop had been used as the site for a beacon lit to warn of the coming of the Spanish Armada in 1588, linking The Wrekin in Shropshire with the next beacon on Alderley Edge. </p> <p>From the car park, head north for a few yards following the Gritstone Way and Mow Cop Trail signs on the broad track towards residential Wood Street. Turn right on crossing the road and then immediately left, where a signpost points towards the strange pinnacle of the Old Man of Mow. </p> <p>This isolated, leaning splinter of gritstone was left by the quarrymen in the quarry just to the north of the tower.

      "bodyText": "One cold May Sunday in 1807, a Stoke-on-Trent wheelwright named Hugh Bourne climbed to the windswept 335m summit of Mow Cop, on the borders of Staffordshire and Cheshire, to launch the Primitive Methodist movement. Bourne, his brother and his friend William Clowes of Burslem were anxious to return to a far simpler form of religious observance, and they invited a number of like-minded friends to that first \"camp meeting\" of the new order. The meeting is said to have lasted for between 12 and 14 hours, and was the precursor of many similar mass gatherings on this well-known viewpoint. A century later, more than 70,000 of Bourne's disciples gathered to worship here at what had become their \"Holy Mount\". Mow Cop is certainly an inspiring place, with its extensive westward views over the broad Cheshire Plain as far as the Berwyn Mountains of North Wales, north-east to the hills of the Peak and southwards as far as the dark conifers of Cannock Chase and the dim outlines of the Shropshire Hills. Nearer at hand, the huge white saucer of the Jodrell Bank radio telescope is prominent in the broad green plain below. To the north are the tower blocks of Stockport and Manchester, beyond wooded Alderley Edge, and the airliners coming in and out of Manchester International Airport. Our walk starts at the car park near the summit and descends through woodland to the Ackers Wood railway crossing in the plain below the hill, and follows the towpath of the Macclesfield Canal before climbing up to Mow Cop again via the hamlet of Mount Pleasant. The mock-gothic folly castle that tops the hill was built in 1754 by the local squire, Randle Wilbraham, to adorn the eastern skyline as seen from his home three miles to the west at Rode Hall. The folly takes the form of a two-storey circular tower alongside a gothic-arched curtain wall. Earlier, the hilltop of Mow Cop had been used as the site for a beacon lit to warn of the coming of the Spanish Armada in 1588, linking The Wrekin in Shropshire with the next beacon on Alderley Edge. From the car park, head north for a few yards following the Gritstone Way and Mow Cop Trail signs on the broad track towards residential Wood Street. Turn right on crossing the road and then immediately left, where a signpost points towards the strange pinnacle of the Old Man of Mow. This isolated, leaning splinter of gritstone was left by the quarrymen in the quarry just to the north of the tower. It is strange how many prominent British hills - such as the Old Man of Coniston in the southern Lake District and the Old Man of Storr on Skye - take the epithet \"Old Man\". Perhaps it is a recognition of the measure of affection that local people have for these important and familiar local landmarks.

Cross Woodcock Lane and pass the village Post Office and Stores on the left, turning left into the High Street and back to the car park at Mow Cop in about 350m. In 1932, the Primitive Methodist movement merged with the parent church, and five years later, more than 10,000 Methodists attended a service at Mow Cop when the summit was formally handed over to its present owners, the National Trust.

      "body": "<p>Like a match report when your team wins, Alan Greenspan's speeches always reward a rereading. This week's address to an American conference of bankers by the Federal Reserve chairman was no exception. Investors' first reading prompted a record one-day rise in the Nasdaq index of 10%. Second thoughts were much, much gloomier. </p> <p>Greenspan is circumspect in his authority as the financial world's most powerful individual. His pronouncements tend to reflect the audience's own prejudices and predispositions back to them. </p> <p>That is not to say that Greenspan's words are impenetrable, just suitably guarded. His milieu is, after all, replete with uncertainty. And, for all his ability to influence the economy's future, he is unable to determine it. Over the years he has strived to maximise the visibility of economic policy without allowing corporates and individuals to forget how risky the world really is. No easy task when the desire to make a fast buck is so prevalent. </p> <p>This week's speech took the slowdown in the American economy as its subject. The switchback reaction of the US stockmarket reflected confusion about the extent of the deceleration. Day one's euphoria celebrated impending interest rate cuts. Day two's hangover focused on impending profit warnings. </p> <p>Greenspan had nothing overt to say on the speed with which the US will grow in 2001. In the third quarter of this year America's economy expanded at a rate of 2.4%. Until a few years ago this would have been regarded as normal. Now, the technology revolution has created expectations that the normal rate of growth is more like 4% to 5% a year. So the recent pace looks disappointing. </p> <p>Signs are, moreover, that activity is less buoyant than in the third quarter. The national association of purchasing managers' monthly survey has suggested a softening rate of growth throughout 2000. Now it's hinting at outright sogginess. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meets for its regular interest rate debate next week. Nearly all observers believe the next move in rates is down, some say as early as next week. </p> <p>Greenspan's latest language is intriguing. In describing the recent downswing in the tech industries he talks of \"some overreaching\" and \"some disappointment\". He cites \"some aspiring entrepreneurs [who] entered the tail end of a short-term boomlet\". The message is that nothing's occurring that should be surprising, nor is so widespread as to suggest the whole game is over. </p> <p>Although the great interventionist - witness 1987 and 1998 - Greenspan is at heart a believer in the self-correcting mechanisms of the capitalist system. Why, then, one might ask, is this process of reassessment taking place now? In large part, it appears to be the expected byproduct of the economy's transition to a more sustainable balance in the growth of demand and supply. </p> <p>He's clearly sensitised though, in particular because the slowdown is not confined to the new economy. As Greenspan himself points out, housebuilding has cooled, new car sales and those of other consumer durables have slowed, and data on hours worked give an early signal that the tourniquet constricting the labour market is beginning to loosen. </p> <p>Economies readily fall victim to virtuous and vicious circles. During expansion phases positive forces reinforce each other and an economy's participants are suffused with a warm feeling of well-being. The reverse is true of downturns where bogeymen appear to lurk around every corner and the economy spooks itself. </p> <p>The vicious circle now threatening to take hold of the US has various elements. These include the effect on personal wealth of falling share prices; the increased cost of credit to ventures perceived to be disproportionately risky; scepticism about the likely commercial viability of many new technologies; and introspection brought on by the presidential election debacle. </p> <p><strong> Vicious circle</strong><br> Of particular concern to Greenspan is evidence from US banks that bad debts are increasing. In part this is a function of failing dot.coms, but not exclusively so. There is no suggestion that the banking system is about to be brought down by a collapse in its asset base, but the marginal effect on a slowing economy could be substantial. The circle could become more vicious. Interest rate cuts would work in the opposite direction, but would be unlikely by themselves to correct a tailspin. </p> <p>The day after Greenspan's speech, the largest US domestic bank, Bank of America, surprised investors with a profits warning. Although it is reported that the bank has around 10% of its loans outstanding to the hi-tech TMT sectors, it has alsohit bad debt problems in the old economy. </p> <p>It will take some time to turn round a \"supertanker\" such as Bank of America. In the meantime expect it to cut peripheral activities and further tighten lending conditions.

      "bodyText": "Like a match report when your team wins, Alan Greenspan's speeches always reward a rereading. This week's address to an American conference of bankers by the Federal Reserve chairman was no exception. Investors' first reading prompted a record one-day rise in the Nasdaq index of 10%. Second thoughts were much, much gloomier. Greenspan is circumspect in his authority as the financial world's most powerful individual. His pronouncements tend to reflect the audience's own prejudices and predispositions back to them. That is not to say that Greenspan's words are impenetrable, just suitably guarded. His milieu is, after all, replete with uncertainty. And, for all his ability to influence the economy's future, he is unable to determine it. Over the years he has strived to maximise the visibility of economic policy without allowing corporates and individuals to forget how risky the world really is. No easy task when the desire to make a fast buck is so prevalent. This week's speech took the slowdown in the American economy as its subject. The switchback reaction of the US stockmarket reflected confusion about the extent of the deceleration. Day one's euphoria celebrated impending interest rate cuts. Day two's hangover focused on impending profit warnings. Greenspan had nothing overt to say on the speed with which the US will grow in 2001. In the third quarter of this year America's economy expanded at a rate of 2.4%. Until a few years ago this would have been regarded as normal. Now, the technology revolution has created expectations that the normal rate of growth is more like 4% to 5% a year. So the recent pace looks disappointing. Signs are, moreover, that activity is less buoyant than in the third quarter. The national association of purchasing managers' monthly survey has suggested a softening rate of growth throughout 2000. Now it's hinting at outright sogginess. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meets for its regular interest rate debate next week. Nearly all observers believe the next move in rates is down, some say as early as next week. Greenspan's latest language is intriguing. In describing the recent downswing in the tech industries he talks of \"some overreaching\" and \"some disappointment\". He cites \"some aspiring entrepreneurs [who] entered the tail end of a short-term boomlet\". The message is that nothing's occurring that should be surprising, nor is so widespread as to suggest the whole game is over. Although the great interventionist - witness 1987 and 1998 - Greenspan is at heart a believer in the self-correcting mechanisms of the capitalist system. Why, then, one might ask, is this process of reassessment taking place now? In large part, it appears to be the expected byproduct of the economy's transition to a more sustainable balance in the growth of demand and supply. He's clearly sensitised though, in particular because the slowdown is not confined to the new economy. As Greenspan himself points out, housebuilding has cooled, new car sales and those of other consumer durables have slowed, and data on hours worked give an early signal that the tourniquet constricting the labour market is beginning to loosen. Economies readily fall victim to virtuous and vicious circles. During expansion phases positive forces reinforce each other and an economy's participants are suffused with a warm feeling of well-being. The reverse is true of downturns where bogeymen appear to lurk around every corner and the economy spooks itself. The vicious circle now threatening to take hold of the US has various elements. These include the effect on personal wealth of falling share prices; the increased cost of credit to ventures perceived to be disproportionately risky; scepticism about the likely commercial viability of many new technologies; and introspection brought on by the presidential election debacle. Vicious circle Of particular concern to Greenspan is evidence from US banks that bad debts are increasing. In part this is a function of failing dot.coms, but not exclusively so. There is no suggestion that the banking system is about to be brought down by a collapse in its asset base, but the marginal effect on a slowing economy could be substantial. The circle could become more vicious. Interest rate cuts would work in the opposite direction, but would be unlikely by themselves to correct a tailspin. The day after Greenspan's speech, the largest US domestic bank, Bank of America, surprised investors with a profits warning. Although it is reported that the bank has around 10% of its loans outstanding to the hi-tech TMT sectors, it has alsohit bad debt problems in the old economy. It will take some time to turn round a \"supertanker\" such as Bank of America. In the meantime expect it to cut peripheral activities and further tighten lending conditions. Not great news for the US economy - especially as Citibank, the world's biggest, has a much greater proportion of its loan book extended to TMT companies. It looks then as if next year Greenspan will once again earn every cent of his salary (raised only this week). Bond markets show an expectation of rates falling from their 6.5% level. The trick, as ever, will be for the Fed to finesse the reductions. Next week seems unlikely, but remember surprise is one of the most powerful weapons in the Greenspan armoury.

But more seriously, he wasn't sexy in the least - he was hideous, even when young. Those piggy little eyes, that thin, curtain-twitching little mouth, the voice a tight whine of ill-temper - ugh! If he was anything like as unattractive, whiny and boring as a child as he was as an adult, I'm not surprised his mother - Julia, by all accounts an attractive, intelligent, high-spirited woman who must have felt she'd given birth to a switched baby - ran away and left him with his Aunt Mimi.

After the initial provincial excitement of copping off with a \"Jap\", as Lennon so frequently referred to his lady love, I think it fair to say that there wasn't even a great deal of physical attraction - on either side, and who can blame either one after seeing that album cover?

But when Lennon wanted to turn back, he was too afraid of losing face. Instead, he swaddled himself in (\"Imagine no . . .\") possessions; at the height of their swinishness, the Ono-Lennons kept a whole apartment in the Dakota building, just below the one they lived in, for the exclusive occupation of their fur coats - just to keep them at the right temperature.

And, of course, it was a ridiculous thing to say - for a start, Jesus had better songs and he didn't go about calling people \"Queer Jews\". A far better comparison would be with the Queen Mother, about whom it is equally impossible to imagine the BBC ever making even a slightly critical programme.

He was trained by Boucher and van Loo, the masters of this 18th-century style, and by the more realist Chardin. He worked to all kinds of commissions, including one to paint an aristocrat's mistress.

Like the early 18th-century French painter Watteau, the greatest exponent of the curly, fluent style known as the rococo, he slips constantly between representation and metaphor. Watteau painted pastoral scenes of masked love and dreamy seductions. But where Watteau implies sex, Fragonard paints it directly in scenes of voyeurism, the man looking up his mistress's skirt in The Swing, or a secret liaison in The Stolen Kiss (c.1766). There's a graphic explicitness to his art, yet, at the same time, he's a true rococo artist in his enjoyment of textures, silks and lace for their own sake. </p> <p>In this painting, the way the paint is stippled and roughened on the white lace collar makes you unconsciously feel the texture of lace. Other paintings by Fragonard dive into masses of soft green leaves and woodland shadows, a theatre for reverie. Here, there is no setting other than a creamy olive backdrop, and the fantasy takes place in the way the woman is painted. She herself is a pastoral landscape in which the painter loses himself in brownish hues, rivulets of paint, a forest of brushstrokes. </p> <p>Fragonard's pleasure in painting this woman is such that he does not seem to want it to end. The portrait's unfinished appearance - though it is intended to be shown as it is - gives it the feeling of a secret compact between artist and subject. The painting is suspended in the midst of feeling; it's spontaneous, alive, and makes you think of 18th-century ideas of nature, the cult of Rousseau, Marie-Antoinette dressed as a shepherdess. The young woman's hair is unkempt, her social mask dropped, she's without the wigs and finery of the court. </p> <p>Yet there's more to it than that, a teasing, mysterious quality, heightened by the bizarre joke Fragonard played on art historians by giving the painting a false signature - his own has since been found underneath. The great scholar of French painting Pierre Rosenberg identified it as a Fragonard in 1974. Fragonard's secretiveness in this painting, as well as his lightness of touch, make for a sentiment the opposite of that we associate with rococo art. Here we see an early Romantic sensibility emerging, a desire to capture the essence rather than the social fa\u00e7ade of a person, the flux of life rather than a mask. </p> <p> <strong>Inspirations and Influences: </strong> The quick, unfinished brushing of this portrait is a source for Impressionism. Fragonard was a model for at least one Impressionist painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919); see, for example, Little Blue Nude (c.1878-9) currently in Impression at The National Gallery. Renoir shares Fragonard's unapologetic, sensual pleasure in paint as soft as cotton wool. </p> <p><strong> Where is it? </strong> Dulwich Picture Gallery, College Road, London SE21 (020-8693 5254). </p>",

The great scholar of French painting Pierre Rosenberg identified it as a Fragonard in 1974. Fragonard's secretiveness in this painting, as well as his lightness of touch, make for a sentiment the opposite of that we associate with rococo art. Here we see an early Romantic sensibility emerging, a desire to capture the essence rather than the social fa\u00e7ade of a person, the flux of life rather than a mask. Inspirations and Influences: The quick, unfinished brushing of this portrait is a source for Impressionism. Fragonard was a model for at least one Impressionist painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919); see, for example, Little Blue Nude (c.1878-9) currently in Impression at The National Gallery. Renoir shares Fragonard's unapologetic, sensual pleasure in paint as soft as cotton wool. Where is it? Dulwich Picture Gallery, College Road, London SE21 (020-8693 5254).",

It was as if he was being tormented when the real targets should have been Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan.</p> <p>For seven years after Aldington won a record \u00a31.5m damages (plus \u00a3500,000 costs) in his 1989 libel action against Tolstoy, the count avoided payment by making appeals to 15 courts in Britain and Europe, including a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the size of the award violated his right to freedom of expression. He did this, while continuing to live in his big house, and send his children to expensive schools, because of the support of Tory rightwingers, including Aldington's own leader in the Lords, Lord Cranborne.</p> <p>It began to look as though Aldington was being persecuted for having been too close to the deputy Conservative leader, RA \"Rab\" Butler, in the early 1960s, and a friend of Edward Heath.</p> <p>Until he collided with Tolstoy, Aldington could have been judged the happiest, and most decorated and appreciated, of Tory establishmentarians, with a near-perfect curriculum vitae. Born Toby Low, he was the son of Colonel Stuart Low, who died in action in 1942; he sailed through Winchester school and New College, Oxford, where he read jurisprudence, and was called to the bar in 1939.</p> <p>Having joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1934, he was called up immediately and served in Greece, where he won the DSO, then in Crete, the western desert and Tunisia with the Rangers. In 1943, he joined the Eighth Army staff for the Sicilian campaign (MBE) and served as a lieutenant colonel on the staff of 13 Corps in Italy. In 1944, he was appointed brigadier on the general staff of 5 Corps for the final assault from Italy on Austria.</p> <p>It was these last May days in Austria, before Low returned home to stand for parliament, that saw the messy aftermath of the Yalta agreement of February 1945, signed by Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. It was agreed that those Soviet citizens and Yugoslavs who had fought for the Nazis would be turned over to Soviet troops and Yugoslav partisans in exchange for British prisoners liberated by both.</p> <p>There were 70,000 Cossacks and Yugoslav Ustachi in the British zone of Austria, with long and bloody trails behind them. Low was the departing chief-of-staff to Field Marshal Alexander, in charge of operations in food-short Austria. Under Macmillan's orders - as Churchill's minister resident in the Mediterranean - Alexander turned over all the ex-Soviets and ex-Yugoslavs, despite his doubts about 11,000 women and children, to a slaughter that began almost immediately.</p> <p>Having left behind this carefully-shrouded event within days of its beginning, Low began his next two careers. He was elected Conservative MP for Blackpool North in June 1945, when Labour's Clement Attlee replaced Winston Churchill as prime minister. A year later, he began what was to be a successful business career as a director of Grindlay's Bank.</p> <p>As soon as Churchill returned to power in 1951, Low became parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Supply, then minister of state at the Board of Trade, and a privy counsellor in 1954. Knighted in 1957, he was made chairman of the select committee on nationalised industry. Two years later, he became deputy Conservative party chairman. In 1962, he became Lord Aldington, and was free to launch his business career untrammeled.</p> <p>Almost as a one-man show, Aldington linked together all the elements of the establishment, political and economic. In 1964, he became chairman of Grindlay's Bank, and of GEC. In 1971, he joined the BBC general advisory council, and became chairman of Sun-Alliance and the Port of London Authority. In 1972, he became co-chairman, with Jack Jones, of the joint special committee on the ports industry, cutting overmanning massively. He became chairman of Westland in 1977.</p> <p>He remained always a one-nation Tory, who had supported Rab Butler rather than Harold Macmillan.

He was chairman of the Lords' select committee on overseas trade when, in 1985, it judged that Britain was not doing well enough in manufactured exports, which angered the chancellor, Nigel Lawson. When, 15 months later, an obedient Lord Lucas of Chilworth tried to sneer at Aldington's committee findings, he stalked out of the chamber in high dudgeon, with Lord Whitelaw signalling whips to try to soothe him.</p> <p>It was in the mid-1980s, when Aldington was over 70 and winding down his business career, that misdirected lightning struck.

EM.TV, which owns the rights to the Muppets and a 50% stake in the company which owns the rights to Formula One racing, said that it had always acted in good faith. \u00a35m boost for New Look Tom Singh, the multi-millionaire founder of the New Look fashion chain, yesterday donated \u00a35m worth of his own shares to top managers, giving them added incentive to boost the group's flagging share price. Singh is granting potentially lucrative options to 101 directors and senior managers so that they have a vested interest in rebuilding investor confidence in the retailer, battered by a drop in sales and the departure of chief executive Jim Hodkinson in May.",

At a time when the future of cities is being discussed worldwide, Joseph Rykwert offers us an overview of the subject from its tentative beginnings in the Middle East some 10,000 years ago to the extraordinary experience of Mexico City today, with its population of 20m and rising. Has the city been a force for good or bad? When do measures of creative chaos in the life and form of cities tip over into conditions of alienation and dystopia? And what can we do to make our cities happy and healthy places to live in when they are shaped in part by economic forces largely beyond our control? </p> <p>These are important questions. But before any answers, it must be said that the title of Rykwert's beautifully written book is a bit of a lie. This celebrated architectural historian is really telling us the intriguing story of how our cities - including London, Paris, Berlin, Mexico, Canberra, Brasilia and the author's beloved New York - got to be the way they are today. Rykwert is at his best when guiding us effortlessly through the past 10,000 years of city-making and at his happiest revisiting the individual buildings he cares most about. </p> <p>As to how we can best influence positive change in our cities, instead of looking for strictly 21st-century solutions he takes us back to ancient Greece where the city was perfected - or so those of us at the tail end of long generations of classically educated Romantics still like to believe. The Greeks, says Rykwert, used the word \"polis\" to describe both the city and a favourite dice and board game rather like backgammon that depended on the interplay of chance and rule. Chance and rule: this is how they played games and designed cities. It remains, he says, perhaps the ideal way of making humane cities 2,500 years on from the completion of the Parthenon. </p> <p>The city has not been shaped, Rykwert believes, by the kind of relentless impersonal forces of which Marx wrote; instead it is a \"willed artefact . . . a human construct in which many conscious and unconscious factors played their part. It appeared to have some of the interplay of the conscious and unconscious that we find in dreams\". Like dreams, the form of cities is malleable, and as a happy consequence we can do something to change them for our own ends. </p> <p>Cities, says Rykwert in a revealing history-is-about-chaps moment, \"are the aggregate products of the choices that were made by individuals\". They do not develop organically - \"they are too consciously manipulated\" for that - but \"develop quite unnaturally by jumps, by fits and starts\". This \"abrupt and uneven jigsaw of conscious and unconscious workings is exactly what I have always found both fascinating and perplexing\". You and me both, professor. </p> <p>So when did the city go off the rails in so many people's minds and experience? What happened to the golden age of fifth-century Athens? Rykwert, an unashamed city-lover, reminds us that the city has always been under attack by critics who have seen it as a symbol of humankind's fall from grace. Here is Andrew Marvell, quoting from Genesis: \"And Cain . . . builded a city; &amp; called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch\" (Gen 4:17). What the poet wishes to say is that the first city was built by a murderer as a shelter for sinful humanity driven out of the garden of Eden. </p> <p>Not a promising start, then. As for the Greeks, not all of them were in love with the \"polis\"; it was mocked by Aristophanes, while Horace, Martial and Juvenal all laid into Rome. Rykwert might have quoted Julius Caesar here, too: the great soldier and controversial republican dictator com plained loudly in letters about the noise that continued throughout the Roman night and kept him awake. As for the early Christians, their ideal city was, of course, the heavenly or New Jerusalem described in gridded detail by St John in the Apocalypse. Intriguingly, Rykwert goes on to show how idealistic Christian sects - the Shakers, for example - were to build earthly settlements and buildings along St John's divine lines. The heavenly city could, in an unsatisfactory temporal way, be recreated in outline on earth. </p> <p>Earthly cities, full of people making things and money, dancing, eating, singing and making love, can never be as squeaky clean as the New Jerusalem. A healthy, happy city will always be a bit messy, abounding with energy, passion and creativity and the disorder these qualities bring in their Dionysian wake. Rykwert is not against disordered cities, but against those that have lost their soul. No ideal resolution is possible, he argues, in big cities, partly because we all have different visions of what a city might be - the Shoreditch artist's idea will be as different from the Mayfair property developer's as the child sewing dresses in a Calcutta sweatshop will be from a Hollywood starlet shopping for the latest six-figure frocks on Fifth Avenue. </p> <p>There may be no solution, says Rykwert, but by learning from history we can begin to understand the rules of the city-making game. We can see what to do and what not to do; what will make us happy and what will make us sad. What seems to have made so many of us sad at one time or another is the industrial city on overdrive and the subsequent dumb attempts - postmodern architecture with all its trite, whimsical conceits, for example - to tidy it up as it moves into a post-industrial phase. Rykwert spins through the creation of the industrial city and the ills spawned in its wake. But he is never so bald as to suggest, like some latter-day Aristophanes, Martial or Marvell, that all was wrong with the industrial city. It gave Rykwert himself his favourite \"polis\", New York. Without Bessemer and his invention of steel smelting or Otis and the first safe passenger lift, the charismatic Manhattan skyline would never have lifted off. </p> <p>What Rykwert shows to devastating effect is the degree to which architects paid little heed to the plight of the inexorably expanding 19th-century city. They toyed with the design of public buildings, compounded grand urban planning theories (some quite mad), but only rarely considered the dystopian plight of the masses somehow surviving among rows of shabby buildings not fit to be called architecture, awash with sewage and ravaged by disease. \"From this filthy sewer flows gold,\" wrote the social observer Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835; he was describing Manchester, workshop of the world. </p> <p>A linear city that would have stretched from Madrid to St Petersburg, a gallery of railways set on arches around central London, garden cities, cities of towers: all these get their turn under Rykwert's microscope. When the professor gets to the 21st-century city, however, you can see him beginning to throw up his hands. We now live in a world of theme parks, of ersatz urban experiences, cyberspace and SimCity (city making reduced to a digitised game in which money rules). We have the city as all-but-redundant tourist attraction (Venice) and the instant new cities of southern China (Shenzhen, for example) as parodies of their old western counterparts. In a \"the world is too much with us/getting and spending we lay waste our powers\" moment, Rykwert turns to Wordsworth for solace. Faced with such inanities, he finds comfort in these lines: </p> <p> The eye - it cannot choose but see; </p> <p>We cannot bid the ear be still; </p> <p>Our bodies feel, wher'er they be, </p> <p>Against or with our will. </p> <p>In other words, as sensual, sentient beings, we react viscerally against these dystopian visions, from SimCity to Shenzhen. And, in Rykwert's case, retreat to the glorious bustle of Manhattan. Here the city, for all the attempts to denigrate or undermine it by crude planning, mean building or escapist criticism, \"remains unbeaten . . . though under constant siege [New York] has maintained its astonishing and contrary vitality\". The greatest game of \"polis\" ever played, he might have said. You may well take issue with Rykwert and question whether New York is indeed the Athens of our day; but few authors can take you on such a convincing, rigorous and enjoyable journey from the fall of Adam and Eve to an electric-aided sunset over Manhattan. Rykwert's city game is well worth playing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Seduction of Place: The City in the 21st Century Joseph Rykwert 294pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL This is a necessary book. At a time when the future of cities is being discussed worldwide, Joseph Rykwert offers us an overview of the subject from its tentative beginnings in the Middle East some 10,000 years ago to the extraordinary experience of Mexico City today, with its population of 20m and rising. Has the city been a force for good or bad? When do measures of creative chaos in the life and form of cities tip over into conditions of alienation and dystopia? And what can we do to make our cities happy and healthy places to live in when they are shaped in part by economic forces largely beyond our control? These are important questions. But before any answers, it must be said that the title of Rykwert's beautifully written book is a bit of a lie. This celebrated architectural historian is really telling us the intriguing story of how our cities - including London, Paris, Berlin, Mexico, Canberra, Brasilia and the author's beloved New York - got to be the way they are today. Rykwert is at his best when guiding us effortlessly through the past 10,000 years of city-making and at his happiest revisiting the individual buildings he cares most about. As to how we can best influence positive change in our cities, instead of looking for strictly 21st-century solutions he takes us back to ancient Greece where the city was perfected - or so those of us at the tail end of long generations of classically educated Romantics still like to believe. The Greeks, says Rykwert, used the word \"polis\" to describe both the city and a favourite dice and board game rather like backgammon that depended on the interplay of chance and rule. Chance and rule: this is how they played games and designed cities. It remains, he says, perhaps the ideal way of making humane cities 2,500 years on from the completion of the Parthenon. The city has not been shaped, Rykwert believes, by the kind of relentless impersonal forces of which Marx wrote; instead it is a \"willed artefact . . . a human construct in which many conscious and unconscious factors played their part. It appeared to have some of the interplay of the conscious and unconscious that we find in dreams\". Like dreams, the form of cities is malleable, and as a happy consequence we can do something to change them for our own ends. Cities, says Rykwert in a revealing history-is-about-chaps moment, \"are the aggregate products of the choices that were made by individuals\". They do not develop organically - \"they are too consciously manipulated\" for that - but \"develop quite unnaturally by jumps, by fits and starts\". This \"abrupt and uneven jigsaw of conscious and unconscious workings is exactly what I have always found both fascinating and perplexing\". You and me both, professor. So when did the city go off the rails in so many people's minds and experience? What happened to the golden age of fifth-century Athens? Rykwert, an unashamed city-lover, reminds us that the city has always been under attack by critics who have seen it as a symbol of humankind's fall from grace. Here is Andrew Marvell, quoting from Genesis: \"And Cain . . . builded a city; &amp; called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch\" (Gen 4:17). What the poet wishes to say is that the first city was built by a murderer as a shelter for sinful humanity driven out of the garden of Eden. Not a promising start, then. As for the Greeks, not all of them were in love with the \"polis\"; it was mocked by Aristophanes, while Horace, Martial and Juvenal all laid into Rome. Rykwert might have quoted Julius Caesar here, too: the great soldier and controversial republican dictator com plained loudly in letters about the noise that continued throughout the Roman night and kept him awake. As for the early Christians, their ideal city was, of course, the heavenly or New Jerusalem described in gridded detail by St John in the Apocalypse. Intriguingly, Rykwert goes on to show how idealistic Christian sects - the Shakers, for example - were to build earthly settlements and buildings along St John's divine lines. The heavenly city could, in an unsatisfactory temporal way, be recreated in outline on earth. Earthly cities, full of people making things and money, dancing, eating, singing and making love, can never be as squeaky clean as the New Jerusalem. A healthy, happy city will always be a bit messy, abounding with energy, passion and creativity and the disorder these qualities bring in their Dionysian wake. Rykwert is not against disordered cities, but against those that have lost their soul. No ideal resolution is possible, he argues, in big cities, partly because we all have different visions of what a city might be - the Shoreditch artist's idea will be as different from the Mayfair property developer's as the child sewing dresses in a Calcutta sweatshop will be from a Hollywood starlet shopping for the latest six-figure frocks on Fifth Avenue. There may be no solution, says Rykwert, but by learning from history we can begin to understand the rules of the city-making game. We can see what to do and what not to do; what will make us happy and what will make us sad. What seems to have made so many of us sad at one time or another is the industrial city on overdrive and the subsequent dumb attempts - postmodern architecture with all its trite, whimsical conceits, for example - to tidy it up as it moves into a post-industrial phase. Rykwert spins through the creation of the industrial city and the ills spawned in its wake. But he is never so bald as to suggest, like some latter-day Aristophanes, Martial or Marvell, that all was wrong with the industrial city. It gave Rykwert himself his favourite \"polis\", New York. Without Bessemer and his invention of steel smelting or Otis and the first safe passenger lift, the charismatic Manhattan skyline would never have lifted off. What Rykwert shows to devastating effect is the degree to which architects paid little heed to the plight of the inexorably expanding 19th-century city. They toyed with the design of public buildings, compounded grand urban planning theories (some quite mad), but only rarely considered the dystopian plight of the masses somehow surviving among rows of shabby buildings not fit to be called architecture, awash with sewage and ravaged by disease. \"From this filthy sewer flows gold,\" wrote the social observer Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835; he was describing Manchester, workshop of the world. A linear city that would have stretched from Madrid to St Petersburg, a gallery of railways set on arches around central London, garden cities, cities of towers: all these get their turn under Rykwert's microscope. When the professor gets to the 21st-century city, however, you can see him beginning to throw up his hands. We now live in a world of theme parks, of ersatz urban experiences, cyberspace and SimCity (city making reduced to a digitised game in which money rules). We have the city as all-but-redundant tourist attraction (Venice) and the instant new cities of southern China (Shenzhen, for example) as parodies of their old western counterparts. In a \"the world is too much with us/getting and spending we lay waste our powers\" moment, Rykwert turns to Wordsworth for solace. Faced with such inanities, he finds comfort in these lines: The eye - it cannot choose but see; We cannot bid the ear be still; Our bodies feel, wher'er they be, Against or with our will. In other words, as sensual, sentient beings, we react viscerally against these dystopian visions, from SimCity to Shenzhen. And, in Rykwert's case, retreat to the glorious bustle of Manhattan. Here the city, for all the attempts to denigrate or undermine it by crude planning, mean building or escapist criticism, \"remains unbeaten . . . though under constant siege [New York] has maintained its astonishing and contrary vitality\". The greatest game of \"polis\" ever played, he might have said. You may well take issue with Rykwert and question whether New York is indeed the Athens of our day; but few authors can take you on such a convincing, rigorous and enjoyable journey from the fall of Adam and Eve to an electric-aided sunset over Manhattan. Rykwert's city game is well worth playing.",

      "body": "<p>Like atheism, republicanism can seem conventional enough as a quiet, rational assumption, but distinctly odd as soon as it becomes an enthusiasm. Surely, some have argued, there are more important things to get worked up about. Yet there have been times when republicanism has made English pulses race. In the past, it has even seemed the best way of expressing ideals of social justice. There have been great writers for whom republicanism has seemed a channel for the essential powers of the human imagination. To see a world without monarchs has been the prerogative of visionaries and poets. </p> <p>So republicanism has been a part of English literature as much as of English politics. Once, indeed, it was only through fiction that one could describe a society outside monarchy. Thomas More imagined a kind of communist republic in his Utopia, published while he was a courtier of Henry VIII. More would eventually lose his life for contradicting his monarch, yet his famous political fantasy was not considered a dangerous work. Intellectuals could always muse of perfect worlds, as Plato had originally done in his Republic. In the late 19th century, William Morris was still doing so, dreaming of a republican paradise of the future in his News from Nowhere (1890). (His title echoes More's coinage, Utopia, the Greek for \"no place\".) </p> <p>For centuries, the educated classes drew their models of civic virtue from the literature of Greece and Rome, which provided rich republican precedents. Read Shakespeare's Roman plays and, without any gesture at subversion, you are admitted to a world which does not need kings, but in which nobility can still be nurtured. Elizabethans belonged to a society which cohered around a veritable cult of monarchy, yet they were free to admire Brutus in his principled opposition to the tyranny of rule by one individual. There is a long history of thinking of monarchy as the rule of fact, while entertaining a republic as an idealising fiction. </p> <p>Some historians argue that it was only after, not before, executing Charles I in 1649 that English republicanism entered the realm of the possible. The English had killed their king and had to find impressive reasons for having done so. The need inspired the greatest of anti-monarchical writers, John Milton - \"an acrimonious and surly republican\", as Dr Johnson called him. His greatest work, Paradise Lost (1667), was composed after the commonwealth had perished and Charles II had returned to power. It is shadowed by this defeat of republican hopes, the poet's voice \"unchanged/To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,/On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues\". </p> <p>Before this fall, however, Milton had dedicated himself to \"the Good old Cause\" in a stream of pamphlet and polemic. He energetically defended the right of a people \"to call to account a Tyrant, or wicked KING, and after due conviction, to depose, and put him to death\". He ransacked biblical and classical texts for anti-monarchical passages in a 10-year rhetorical war on royalist sentiment. One of his surliest anti-monarchical works, Eikonoklastes, was written in response to a supposed memoir by Charles I, published at the time of his execution. Eikon Basilike, the Portraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings - almost certainly a literary forgery - became one of the bestsellers of the age, convincing Milton of the gullibility of the populace: \"fools and silly gazers\". Republicans have ever regretted the sentimentality of the masses. </p> <p>Milton was fortunate to escape with his life when the monarchy was restored in 1660 and he found himself \"in darkness, and with dangers compast round\". He was probably helped out of peril by fellow poet Andrew Marvell, a republican who managed to couch his views so indirectly that academics still find them difficult to tease out. Marvell's Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland, one of the greatest of political poems, was claimed by both royalist and republican readers. Writers bend their imaginations to the times, and we cannot always tell where the heart is. The young John Dryden wrote poetry celebrating the providence of Cromwell's rule, but immediately upon Charles II's restoration he was celebrating royal justice and magnificence with the best of them. </p> <p>The convictions of Milton and his friends did not perish. The sophisticated arguments of classical republicanism, which were to be put into practice in America, remained current among enlightened intellectuals in the 18th century. For these few there was still (as there scarcely is any longer) a republican intellectual tradition. They read Machiavelli (the godfather of republicanism) and works such as James Harrington's The Commonwealth of Oceana (1656), a vision of an ideal state built on the precedent of More's Utopia. Harrington wrote against Hobbes, who argued that humans, being selfish and violent, needed monarchies to keep them by fear from mutual destruction. Republicanism as Harrington bequeathed it was the consequence of believing in the goodness of human nature. </p> <p>With the French revolution at the end of the 18th century, it was possible again to believe that men and women showed their capacity to make the world better when they got rid of kings and queens. This belief could be passionate if respect for monarchy seemed to stand for deeper human weaknesses. For the pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, in her Vindication of the Rights of Woman, the reverence of British subjects for their king was a model of voluntary enslavement, exactly analogous to the enslavement of women to men. Her future husband, William Godwin, denounced \"the hyperbolical pretensions of monarchy\" for sapping a society's moral energies. The very existence of a king, he said, was evidence of the intellectual cowardice of his subjects. </p> <p>For some, the argument was a literary as well as political battle - a war of styles. The two great antagonists were Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine. Burke lamented the overthrowing of order and tradition in France in a high-aspiring rhetoric whose sonorousness embodied the very trust in customary sentiment for which it argued. </p> <p>Paine's radicalism, in direct response, was a matter of form as much as content. \"Lay the axe to the roots!\" he exclaimed, writing in a style (designed to be read aloud) whose plainness and sarcasm put false refinement to the sword. </p> <p>Paine was prosecuted for sedition not just because of his arguments, but also because of their accessibility. Yet his animus against George III was not always shared by other British radicals, even if the king's son, the Prince Regent, was generally reviled. \"An old, mad, blind, despised and dying King\" was how George III was characterised in Shelley's republican sonnet England in 1819, but four of those adjectives are not reasons for contempt, while \"despised\" was not strictly true. But Shelley, who was writing about the British monarchy from exile in Italy, took the person of the king as the mirror of man's moral failings. Like his father-in-law, Godwin, he made the monarch's existence a sign of all that was worst and weakest in human nature. </p> <p>It is no accident that all the major English Romantic poets at least dabbled in republicanism. Literary and political revolutions seemed twinned, both born from a new faith in the imagination. Wordsworth's The Prelude, completed in 1805 when the poet had retreated from the radical politics of his youth, remains the most eloquent testament of this enthusiasm. In its first flush, Wordsworth and others produced versions of republicanism that would later embarrass them. Wordsworth wrote his passionate Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff, an unflinching vindication of the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. It dismisses any expression of horror at the execution as \"the idle cry of modish lamentation\" and envisages a kingless state with universal (male) suffrage. </p> <p>Luckily for the future poet laureate, it remained unpublished and the evidence of his youthful radicalism remained buried in his poems of the period, preoccupied with the plight of vagrants and the rural poor. Wordsworth's friend Southey did, however, publish his drama Wat Tyler, a celebration of revolutionary republicanism as personified by the legendary leader of the Peasants' Revolt. He was mortified years later when Chartist radicals began reprinting it. By then a steadfast Tory and Anglican, he went to court to have the publication of his own work banned. </p> <p>For some Chartists in the 19th century, an end to monarchical power was symbolically associated with an extension of the suffrage. Their movement kept alive a resourceful, coarse literature of republican mockery and polemic, below the horizon of polite literary taste. Republicanism was one strain in the political satire of William Hone, whose lampoons and parodies were sometimes savagely illustrated by Cruikshank. In Victorian England, anti-monarchism closely followed the populist instincts of Chartism. Republicanism was kept alive by writers and publishers such as GMW Reynolds, who smuggled it into his cheap and highly popular mystery thrillers for lower-class readers. </p> <p>Yet the greatest assistant to republicanism in all of the last two centuries was probably George IV. His sybaritism, his mistreatment of his wife (famously locked out of Westminster Abbey during his coronation) and his sheer grossness made vivid mock of monarchy. He inspired some of republicanism's most energetic flights of satirical fancy, from Byron's devilish Vision of Judgement to Shelley's raucously contemptuous Swellfoot the Tyrant. </p> <p>In recent times, equally, the private lives of members of the royal family have seemed to threaten their status far more than any political antagonist. Coleridge in the 1790s, when republicanism was truly afoot, reflected on a lesson for monarchists and anti-monarchists alike: \"If Monarchs would behave like republicans, all their subjects would act as royalists.\" Perhaps the legacy of our rich literature of republicanism is the sense that its greatest resource is not the force of intellectual argument, but the mere misconduct of royalty.</p>",

      "body": "<p> At a time when popular historians such as Simon Schama are writing books with all the punch of contemporary fiction, it is only to be expected that novelists should plunder history in return. American writer Betsy Tobin takes us back to a 17th-century England brimming with warm ale, witch hunts, evil humours and bleeding cures. <strong> Bone House </strong> (Review, \u00a310), a euphemism for the complicated system of stays and corsets designed to rein in unnatural female passion, is the story of larger-than-life Dora, a zesty prostitute in a small god-fearing village. Known as the \"great bellied woman\", she provides physical and emotional solace to both men and women. But Dora dies horribly on the first page, and it is up to Tobin's young female narrator to find out why. All the bleak horrors of the period are conjured, but Tobin's workmanlike plot becomes stifling after a while. Less than satisfying as a mystery, the novel is nonetheless strong on atmosphere, and will appeal to devotees of the gothic romance. <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000241898,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Another American, Darin Strauss, has imagined the stranger-than-fiction lives of <strong> Chang &amp; Eng </strong> (Allison &amp; Busby, \u00a39.99). Born in early 19th-century China, these original Siamese twins were attached by a single wide band at their chest. Snatched from their parents by the King of Siam, they were kept as a show-piece before being sold to a travelling circus as a freakshow. Yet they soon became wealthy enough to dictate the pattern of their own lives, settled in America, married, and between them fathered 21 children.

      "bodyText": "At a time when popular historians such as Simon Schama are writing books with all the punch of contemporary fiction, it is only to be expected that novelists should plunder history in return. American writer Betsy Tobin takes us back to a 17th-century England brimming with warm ale, witch hunts, evil humours and bleeding cures. Bone House (Review, \u00a310), a euphemism for the complicated system of stays and corsets designed to rein in unnatural female passion, is the story of larger-than-life Dora, a zesty prostitute in a small god-fearing village. Known as the \"great bellied woman\", she provides physical and emotional solace to both men and women. But Dora dies horribly on the first page, and it is up to Tobin's young female narrator to find out why. All the bleak horrors of the period are conjured, but Tobin's workmanlike plot becomes stifling after a while. Less than satisfying as a mystery, the novel is nonetheless strong on atmosphere, and will appeal to devotees of the gothic romance. Buy it at BOL Another American, Darin Strauss, has imagined the stranger-than-fiction lives of Chang &amp; Eng (Allison &amp; Busby, \u00a39.99). Born in early 19th-century China, these original Siamese twins were attached by a single wide band at their chest. Snatched from their parents by the King of Siam, they were kept as a show-piece before being sold to a travelling circus as a freakshow. Yet they soon became wealthy enough to dictate the pattern of their own lives, settled in America, married, and between them fathered 21 children. In this deft fabrication, though the brothers share a stomach they have little else in common. Chang, a charmer, becomes dependent on adulation and alcohol alike, whereas the more saturnine Eng reads Shakespeare and joins the Temperance movement.

The way he dressed, for example. The cover of this book shows him resplendent in white hat, high collar, silk shirt and tie, tie pin, tweed jacket, white flannels and shoes, sporting a cane: the ultimate dandy. Accentuated by the curling handlebar moustache, he looks out at the viewer with an air of mild amusement as though from somewhere far away.

Casting around for the right adjective, \"Pythonesque\" comes to mind, in its association of the stuffily conventional with the berserk. Ardent rousseltre John Ashbery, in many ways godfather to this critical biography by Mark Ford, describes the Frenchman's works as \"the perfectly preserved temple of a cult which has disappeared without trace, or a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered\". </p> <p>In his excellent book, Ford prefaces his plunge into the labyrinth with a statement of aims: \"I determined to try to make him appear as a writer who is worth reading, rather than as an engaging exotic or an intriguing case history.\" Winding up his account of this unique life and works, however, Ford wittily concedes that, after all, \"no age could be ready for a wind-powered road-mender's tool capable of making a mosaic out of human teeth, or hairs dancing the jig 'Sir Roger de Coverly' from pore to pore across a man's bald pate, or tarot cards containing tiny insects that perform 'The Bluebells of Scotland', or a furless cat who transforms himself into a living battery and stimulates the remnants of Danton's head to fresh flights of oratory\". </p> <p>This litany of wonders comes from the 1914 novel Loctis Solus and could be extended almost indefinitely, such is the fecundity of Roussel's imagination. But he has claims on our attention, Ford argues, for reasons beyond those of inventing weird contraptions. These reside chiefly in his proc\u00e9d\u00e9, a technique based on the pun which, in true Roussellian cloak-and-dagger fashion, he revealed posthumously, in a book entitled Comment j'ai \u00e9crit certains de mes livres. One example of the proc\u00e9d\u00e9 transforms the phrase \" Napoleon premier empereur \" into \" nappe oll\u00e9 ombre miettes hampe air heure\" (tablecloth ol\u00e9 shadow crumbs pole wind time). As Ford explains: \"For the first of four elements he devised a scene in which castanet-clicking dancers perform a lively flamenco on a fully laden table.\" He continues: \"While on one level the proc\u00e9d\u00e9 reveals all words - or fragments of words - to have potential double meanings, on another it imposes on them the strictest possible laws of connection.\" </p> <p>It should be clear even from this brief expos\u00e9 why Roussel has been championed by more recent writers who foreground the opacity, autonomy and self-proliferating nature of language. The Oulipo group were natural followers (one thinks of Queneau's sonnet \"machine\"), but Alain Robbe-Grillet and Michel Butor have also cast him as one of the founders of the nouveau roman. Confronting Roussel's poem \"La Vue\", a 73-page description of a tiny beach scene enclosed behind glass in a pen-holder, written in hypnotic alexandrines, Robbe-Grillet remarked on its \"demented acuity\" and the \"total transparency, which leaves neither shadow nor reflection behind it\". And he captures the most disturbing effect to be found in all of Roussel's writing: \"Roussel describes, and beyond what he describes, there is nothing.\" There is no moral contour - in Impressions d'Afrique circus acts alternate with ingeniously horrible executions, in a kind of karaoke-cum-freakshow, all described with the same implacable neutrality. There is no hint of transcendence, no psychology, barely any subjectivity. Which is why, tempting though it is to liken Roussel to Proust, as his \"dark, disturbed double\" - they were both handsome, rich (Roussel fantastically so), bourgeois, homosexual, neurasthenic, reclusive - their work is radically different. </p> <p>With what Ford beautifully calls his \"inviolable naivety\", Roussel lays out his proc\u00e9d\u00e9 with all the seriousness of the professor-heroes of Poe or his beloved Jules Verne, up there with Dante and Shakespeare (probably a little higher) in Roussel's eccentric pantheon. And it is this inviolable naivety that, throughout the extraordinary episodes and vicissitudes of his life, gives Roussel his charm and makes him so irresistible. Born into a vast fortune, the son of an adoring, eccentric mother - she had a set of bathtubs installed for her chihuahas in her Biarritz villa - Roussel never really had to leave what he called \"the perfect bliss\" of his pampered childhood. </p> <p>At the age of 19, while writing his first interminable poem, \"La Doublure\", he underwent an experience that he called \" la gloire\". The conviction that he was to be one of the greatest writers of all time never really left him. As he explained to his psychiatrist Pierre Janet - who, not surprisingly, later wrote up the poet as a case history - he could compose his poems only in carefully screened rooms because \"to leave these papers lying about would have sent out rays of light as far as China\". Roussel would not be Roussel, as Ford admits, if one did not have to ask the question his critics always asked: \"Is Roussel mad? Or is he possessed of such luminous powers that we cannot bear the glare?\" \"Is it nothing? Or is it everything?\" </p> <p>Even the Surrealists, who were almost alone in championing Roussel during his lifetime, could not fathom him. And Roussel, with supreme irony, never cared much for this audience of Young Turks, venturing that he found their works \"un peu obscur\". The story of his dealings with them, sometimes carried on through his business manager or a detective agency, is a long, exquisitely polite and baffled malentendu. It is also richly comic - as are the accounts of Roussel's ruinous theatrical ventures in his attempt to buy the public acclaim which always eluded him. As Cocteau suggested, Roussel's genius \"extends to the furthest type of extreme of the practical\". In his lifetime, he invented a type of house insulation, devised the first custom-built camper van - his famous roulotte - and calculated a fiendish endgame in chess. He also went on two world tours, spending most of the time sealed off behind closed curtains. Quite apart from these singular achievements, we have his works. No words can describe them adequately, though Mark Ford, in his delicate, patient and tactful way, sets forth their procedures with admirable clarity. His book should swell the numbers of those now dedicated to furthering la gloire of Raymond Roussel.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Ship Fever, by Andrea Barrett (Flamingo, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> Each of these stories could serve as a preparatory sketch for an epic. Writers whose trade is plundering the past and fictionalising the biographies of great men or great times must be cursing Barrett for making use of Gregor Mendel, Carl Linnaeus, 19th-century scientific voyagers and Grosse Isle off the Canada coast, where Irish emigrants were quarantined before being allowed into the New World. Barrett, though, lends emotion to history. Linnaeus is an old man who cannot remember his daughter's name; and we see from a woman's point of view the egoism of scientific discovery. Barrett has subtlety, elegance and a fine understanding of human nature. </p> <p> <strong> Going, Going, Gone, by Jack Womack (Voyager, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> The point of Womack is linguistic fireworks: every sentence is a small display with a show-off image. He makes sure every paragraph will win a few rounds of applause and then some, but essentially he rewrites Chandler substituting 1960s east coast, LSD and politics for 1930s west coast, bourbon and divorce cases. Walter Bullitt does things on the quiet for men in Washington but prefers \"hep\" New York. He isn't too happy with a new assignment involving Robert Kennedy, nor with the two ghostly figures who have moved into his brain. Weird piles on weird, but after a few near-death experiences Bullitt gets the girl and straightens things out. </p> <p> <strong> Brilliant Careers: The Virago Book of 20th Century Fiction, eds Ali Smith, Kasia Boddy &amp; Sarah Wood (Virago, \u00a39.99) ; The Secret Woman: The Virago Book of Classic Short Stories, ed Lynn Knight (Virago, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Either of these repackagings of the 20th century's best female writing is a good idea; both is too much. Brilliant Careers picks a writer a year to illustrate the past century - Elaine Dundy, Miles Franklin (of course), E M Nesbit, Gillian Slovo, Eudora Welty and so on - and tells a literary history in fragments. Secret Lives gives you complete \"classic\" stories by authors who all appear in the first book. Of the two, Brilliant Careers works better as a taster of Virago's back catalogue. </p> <p> <strong> A Mother's Kisses, by Bruce Jay Friedman (Chicago, \u00a39)</strong> </p> <p> Friedman wrote a couple of multiplex teen movies - Splash and Stir Crazy - but back in the mid-1960s he was being held up as the \"new JD Salinger\" for Stern and this, his second novel. Joseph is a disgruntled Brooklyn teenager who, when he doesn't get into Columbia, fills up with teenage ennui. Everything should be tentative fumbles with local girls and all-purpose desperation, except for the presence of Joseph's mother Meg, the archetypal Brooklyn matriarch. The pairing of the Jewish mother-and-son gag with the tortured adolescent makes for a brilliantly funny picaresque in which neither archetype is allowed to upstage the other. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Ship Fever, by Andrea Barrett (Flamingo, \u00a36.99) Each of these stories could serve as a preparatory sketch for an epic. Writers whose trade is plundering the past and fictionalising the biographies of great men or great times must be cursing Barrett for making use of Gregor Mendel, Carl Linnaeus, 19th-century scientific voyagers and Grosse Isle off the Canada coast, where Irish emigrants were quarantined before being allowed into the New World. Barrett, though, lends emotion to history. Linnaeus is an old man who cannot remember his daughter's name; and we see from a woman's point of view the egoism of scientific discovery. Barrett has subtlety, elegance and a fine understanding of human nature. Going, Going, Gone, by Jack Womack (Voyager, \u00a36.99) The point of Womack is linguistic fireworks: every sentence is a small display with a show-off image. He makes sure every paragraph will win a few rounds of applause and then some, but essentially he rewrites Chandler substituting 1960s east coast, LSD and politics for 1930s west coast, bourbon and divorce cases. Walter Bullitt does things on the quiet for men in Washington but prefers \"hep\" New York. He isn't too happy with a new assignment involving Robert Kennedy, nor with the two ghostly figures who have moved into his brain. Weird piles on weird, but after a few near-death experiences Bullitt gets the girl and straightens things out. Brilliant Careers: The Virago Book of 20th Century Fiction, eds Ali Smith, Kasia Boddy &amp; Sarah Wood (Virago, \u00a39.99) ; The Secret Woman: The Virago Book of Classic Short Stories, ed Lynn Knight (Virago, \u00a38.99) Either of these repackagings of the 20th century's best female writing is a good idea; both is too much. Brilliant Careers picks a writer a year to illustrate the past century - Elaine Dundy, Miles Franklin (of course), E M Nesbit, Gillian Slovo, Eudora Welty and so on - and tells a literary history in fragments. Secret Lives gives you complete \"classic\" stories by authors who all appear in the first book. Of the two, Brilliant Careers works better as a taster of Virago's back catalogue. A Mother's Kisses, by Bruce Jay Friedman (Chicago, \u00a39) Friedman wrote a couple of multiplex teen movies - Splash and Stir Crazy - but back in the mid-1960s he was being held up as the \"new JD Salinger\" for Stern and this, his second novel. Joseph is a disgruntled Brooklyn teenager who, when he doesn't get into Columbia, fills up with teenage ennui. Everything should be tentative fumbles with local girls and all-purpose desperation, except for the presence of Joseph's mother Meg, the archetypal Brooklyn matriarch. The pairing of the Jewish mother-and-son gag with the tortured adolescent makes for a brilliantly funny picaresque in which neither archetype is allowed to upstage the other.",

Sometimes these are belly laughs, sometimes chuckles, sometimes the dark laughter of the grotesque - as when Christ is laughed at by spectators as he hangs in agony at Golgotha. </p> <p>The crucifixion is, perhaps, the classically dangerous cultural rendezvous for laughter and tears, and not just in Monty Python's Life of Brian. The uneasy conjoining of the two has been a feature of Western civilisation right from Euripides (maniacal women kicking a severed head round like a football) to Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon (the ambivalent trembling of a trifle that may, or may not, be a terrorist bomb). </p> <p>Maybe the Greek and the Irishman have it right. In an absurd world, perhaps a bit of nervous laughter is more honest than floods of tears. As Tom Lutz points out in Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears - one of two new books in the burgeoning literature of emotion - there is a tradition of moral weeping that has more to do with a show of piety than with genuine sadness. This piety isn't always heavenly. Saint Augustine, who unlike other divines found himself unable to sob his troubles into God's ear, would no doubt have disapproved of teenagers crying themselves a river through Titanic. </p> <p>Although some argue that elephants shed the odd tear in sadness and we know that crocodiles express fluid from their lachrymal ducts when opening their mouths very wide (thus crocodile tears), it is generally agreed that humans are the only animals who cry because of their feelings. We do so at our most important thresholds - birth, love, sex, death - and we do so in different ways but most often when \"least able to fully verbalise\" overwhelming emotions. </p> <p>Yet, as Lutz elaborates, some crying is a turning away from emotion rather than a purging of it: he adduces the evidence of deposition scenes (the lowering of the dead Christ from the cross) in hundreds of classical paintings, in which there is invariably a weeping figure not looking at the body. Often it is the Virgin Mother, and it could be argued that her tears, like those of many mourners since, \"signal a desire, a wish, or a plea\". </p> <p>Tears taken to signify the bereaved's desire to \"wind the clock back\" may seem inappropriate for Mary, but it makes more sense when you think of Freud's 1909 lectures at Clark University in the US, where he argued, in Lutz's paraphrase, that \"patients need to come to terms with their desires rather than their loss\". In some paintings, such as Giovanni Bellini's Piet\u00e0 in the Accademia in Venice, Mary has clearly done this, lying with the body in her lap, her face full of the profound sorrow of acceptance. She is contemplating events rather than demanding their reversal. There is no apostrophe (literally, in Greek, a \"turning away\"), no address or appeal to the apparently absent Father, and not a single teardrop curls down her cheek. </p> <p>Contemplative acceptance is the challenge of the bereaved, even if they do not have a Christ to redeem their loss. For crying infants, meanwhile, redemption comes in the shape of food or attention. A child's tears demand a reaction, although if neglected it will, like a severely depressed person, stop crying altogether. \"It is the infant who believes it will be picked up that wails,\" says Lutz, \"energised by its fear that it will be left alone.\" </p> <p>For Darwin, crying was simply standard mammalian behaviour; later followers have built sophisticated theories of the \"separation cry\" as the oldest evolutionary vocalisation, a tracking device well suited to nocturnal forest-dwellers, though still with us through the plasterboard of many a bedroom wall. </p> <p>Grown-up tears can sometimes mask calculated demands, as Mr Bumble knows when his wife starts to blub in Oliver Twist : \"Tears were not the things to find their way to Mr Bumble's soul; his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter, and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him.\" He goes so far as to encourage her to continue: \"'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and soften downs the temper,' said Mr Bumble. 'So cry away.'\" </p> <p>Did Dickens know about goblet cells and the glands of Manz and Zeiz? Did he know that there are three types of crying: basal (continuous lubrication, at the rate of five to 10 ounces a day), reflex (onions, flies, pokes in the eye) and psychic (partners, parents, kids)? This useful book could have told him all the science; although, as Lutz freely concedes, it is at its best on the cultural rather than the natural history of tears. </p> <p>The strongest passages are those concerned with potentially laughable weeping: the endless sobbing of Goethe's Young Werther, or the hero of Henry Mackenzie's 18th-century novel The Man of Feeling, who cries at just about everything, including the death of the house dog, Trusty. Of that book Fanny Burney, reading it aloud with friends, reported how they roared with laughter where 10 years earlier they had wept copiously. Oscar Wilde reacted against a later, Victorian wave of sentimentalism.\"One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing,\" he wrote, and accordingly gave a steely glint to his own fairy tales. </p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting chapter in Robert Provine's Laughter: A Scientific Investigation deals with exactly such abnormal or inappropriate amusement, citing Titus Andronicus (\"Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour\") on the return of the eponymous Roman general's own severed hand and the heads of the two sons it was supposed to ransom. The grotesquerie of Shakespeare's tragedy would take a literary mind back to Euripides, but Provine's investigation is, as it says on the tin, a scientific one. He moves swiftly on to kuru, that degenerative neighbour of BSE in the early stages of which victims display \"paroxysmal hilarity\", often \"laughing at their own stumbling gait and fall\" with relatives sometimes joining in. </p> <p>Kuru is just one of a number of fascinating conditions listed by Provine. They include the masque manganique , a fixed but jovial facial expression described in Moroccan miners suffering magnesium poisoning, and the toxic effects of crowfoot or wild parsley; profuse in Sardinia, it gave us and Homer the term \"sardonic laughter\". Provine's enjoyable fairground tour of the science of the laugh also takes us to sound labs and opera houses (can there be a true musical notation of laughter?) and raises the ticklish question of why we can't tickle ourselves. Elsewhere he considers everything from laughter's part in boosting the immune system to the role of laughter in speech evolution. As with grooming (the tit for tat of monkeys removing fleas from each other), it is clear that laughter was important in the development of social cohesion. Who knows, perhaps the first human sound uttered in those primeval forests was a \"laugh of togetherness\" rather than a \"separation cry\"? </p> <p>This isn't as far-fetched as it first seems. Our relatives the chimpanzees produce a laugh-like sound, often when gambolling. It's an ah-ah-ah rather than the human ha-ha-ha, Provine tells us, before employing some nifty respiratory science in an attempt to propose a causal link between bipedalism, laughter and vocalisation. </p> <p>It is a nice thought if true (better to begin with a laugh than a whimper), but the way laughter even among friends can so easily tip over into the aggressive or macabre shines a darker light on the thesis. The French philosopher Bergson thought that we laugh mainly when others are humiliated, particularly when they become mechanical or marionette-like or maimed. It is the sheer arbitrariness of this kind of laughter that makes it so terrifying: as like the closing shots of Harry Enfield's comedies as those stumbling kuru victims.

      "body": "<p><strong> Lady Caroline Lamb: This Infernal Woman</strong></p> <p> Susan Normington </p> <p>352pp, House of Stratus, \u00a318.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000396199,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Caroline Lamb, the notorious niece of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire and granddaughter of the first Earl Spencer, was described well by Byron, with whom she had a brief affair during the height of his celebrity, as \"an exaggerated woman\". She was born into the 18th-century aristocratic elite, an insular and inbred world which worshipped superficiality. The values of high society can be illustrated by its near idolisation of the dandy \"Beau\" Brummell, whose only notable characteristic, other than cynicism, was his perfectly knotted necktie. </p> <p>While Brummell conformed to the fashionable world's fantasy of itself, Caroline Lamb did not. The adjective most commonly used of her was \"volcanic\": she was neither cool nor discreet at a time when these were the vital qualities needed in an unfaithful wife, and nor would she, as her collateral relation Princess Diana said, \"go quietly\" when both Byron and her husband's relations decided that they had had enough of her. </p> <p>Caroline married into a powerful and newly rich family bent on establishing themselves at the heart of Whig society, but despite her impeccable pedigree and status she was loathed by the socially conscious Lambs for what they regarded as her self-publicising eccentricities. This included writing novels, the first of which, Glenarvon, was a bestselling scandalous satire of her circle and expos\u00e9 of her relationship with Byron. Her in-laws unsuccessfully tried to ban any further literary output - Lamb produced two more novels and became something of a bluestocking - and when they proved unable to control her unpredictable behaviour took steps to have her certified insane. They failed in this too, but did succeed in separating her from her husband, William - after which she drank a bottle of sherry every day and died at the age of 41 while he became prime minister to Queen Victoria. </p> <p>Susan Normington's reappraisal of Caroline Lamb is long overdue, and it is not claiming much to say that this enjoyable but slight book is the best biography to date. It has been Lamb's legacy to inspire dreadful prose, and Normington's is no exception. \"With her sharp little chin, perfect complexion, golden-red curls, wide, hazel eyes and darting ways she sometimes seemed more like a fairy than a human being,\" she writes of her heroine, and the early days of Caroline's marriage to William Lamb are described as \"a delicious mist of passion, fighting and making up\". </p> <p>Lamb's story has always spawned from her defenders and critics alike an army of hackneyed phrases and mawkish stereotypes. Henry Blyth, Lamb's previous biographer, describes his subject as having \"small kittenish ways of showing her affection, with kisses that touched the cheek and tiny, intimate caresses\". At the same time, \"her small mouth could spit venom as well as list endearments. The tiny feet could stamp in fury\". Lamb's whole personality is reduced to her height. </p> <p>Apart from a few excruciating moments, Normington's representation of Caroline Lamb avoids the traditional resort to sentimentality, fantasy and misogyny, a spectacular example of which is Henry Blyth's suggestion that \"One of the tragedies of their married life is that William had never beaten her at all, and scarcely even slapped her.\" This, Blyth will be happy to know, seems not to have been the case.

      "bodyText": "Lady Caroline Lamb: This Infernal Woman Susan Normington 352pp, House of Stratus, \u00a318.99 Buy it at BOL Caroline Lamb, the notorious niece of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire and granddaughter of the first Earl Spencer, was described well by Byron, with whom she had a brief affair during the height of his celebrity, as \"an exaggerated woman\". She was born into the 18th-century aristocratic elite, an insular and inbred world which worshipped superficiality. The values of high society can be illustrated by its near idolisation of the dandy \"Beau\" Brummell, whose only notable characteristic, other than cynicism, was his perfectly knotted necktie. While Brummell conformed to the fashionable world's fantasy of itself, Caroline Lamb did not. The adjective most commonly used of her was \"volcanic\": she was neither cool nor discreet at a time when these were the vital qualities needed in an unfaithful wife, and nor would she, as her collateral relation Princess Diana said, \"go quietly\" when both Byron and her husband's relations decided that they had had enough of her. Caroline married into a powerful and newly rich family bent on establishing themselves at the heart of Whig society, but despite her impeccable pedigree and status she was loathed by the socially conscious Lambs for what they regarded as her self-publicising eccentricities. This included writing novels, the first of which, Glenarvon, was a bestselling scandalous satire of her circle and expos\u00e9 of her relationship with Byron. Her in-laws unsuccessfully tried to ban any further literary output - Lamb produced two more novels and became something of a bluestocking - and when they proved unable to control her unpredictable behaviour took steps to have her certified insane. They failed in this too, but did succeed in separating her from her husband, William - after which she drank a bottle of sherry every day and died at the age of 41 while he became prime minister to Queen Victoria. Susan Normington's reappraisal of Caroline Lamb is long overdue, and it is not claiming much to say that this enjoyable but slight book is the best biography to date. It has been Lamb's legacy to inspire dreadful prose, and Normington's is no exception. \"With her sharp little chin, perfect complexion, golden-red curls, wide, hazel eyes and darting ways she sometimes seemed more like a fairy than a human being,\" she writes of her heroine, and the early days of Caroline's marriage to William Lamb are described as \"a delicious mist of passion, fighting and making up\". Lamb's story has always spawned from her defenders and critics alike an army of hackneyed phrases and mawkish stereotypes. Henry Blyth, Lamb's previous biographer, describes his subject as having \"small kittenish ways of showing her affection, with kisses that touched the cheek and tiny, intimate caresses\". At the same time, \"her small mouth could spit venom as well as list endearments. The tiny feet could stamp in fury\". Lamb's whole personality is reduced to her height. Apart from a few excruciating moments, Normington's representation of Caroline Lamb avoids the traditional resort to sentimentality, fantasy and misogyny, a spectacular example of which is Henry Blyth's suggestion that \"One of the tragedies of their married life is that William had never beaten her at all, and scarcely even slapped her.\" This, Blyth will be happy to know, seems not to have been the case. Normington documents William's fetish for flogging women and little girls; a topic on which he felt so strongly that he hoped one day to write a treatise describing its virtues. Susan Normington tells the story of Caroline Lamb's troubled marriage, thwarted literary talent and hectic affair with Byron in a clear, straightforward way - and that is the problem. There was little in Lamb's life that was clear and nothing that was straightforward; she was a product of a highly artificial world in which she was surrounded by hypocrites, perverts and duplicitous power seekers. By trying to rationalise her, Normington precisely avoids dealing with Lamb's intensely frustrated, and frustrating, self-sabotaging personality.

She is hoping to count birds migrating over a lake in Kenya. Frankly, I am disgusted. My mother is abusing a worthy conservation project. To my sure knowledge, she has never shown the slightest interest in birds, Kenya or counting. She is obviously hoping to get a free holiday. Earth Watch should be informed: she can't even count. The figures for migrating Kenyan birds could be hopelessly confused for years to come. This could lead to stress and trauma amongst ornithologists and their possible premature deaths. </p> <p> I confided in Glenn my worries about the orphans of the Kenyan ornithologists. He furrowed his brow: \"Why are you worrying about somethin' that 'asn't 'appened yet, Dad.\" I had no satisfactory answer. Later, my therapist, Angela House, asked me precisely the same question. Perhaps I should give her \u00a325 fee to Glenn. At least it would keep the money in the family, and save me the trouble of driving to Mrs House's house, thus avoiding the attendant parking problems and the embarrassment of overhearing Mr House urinating in the downstairs cloakroom. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday, November 29 </strong><br></p> <p> I rang my mother's house this morning, and was astonished and outraged to learn that she was in Paris! Ivan Braithwaite told me she had gone to the hotel where Oscar Wilde died 100 years ago this week. How dare she swan about on the Eurostar when people are starving? It is disgusting. Especially when it is me who is the Wildean expert.</p> <p> Few who saw it will ever forget my depiction of Lady Bracknell in the sex-swap performance of The Importance Of Being Earnest at Neil Armstrong Comprehensive School in 1982. </p> <p> <strong> Friday, December 1 </strong><br></p> <p> Brick Eagleburger has asked his solicitor, Peter Elf, to take a civil action against the American government. Brick is now convinced that his postal vote has been violated. Apparently, Mr Elf was reluctant at first to take on the US, being more used to doing a little light conveyancing in the Hampton Wick area. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday, December 2 </strong><br></p> <p> I have resigned from my position at Eddie's Layby Cafi. The work was very unfulfilling and I never properly came to terms with the constant smell of rancid fat on my clothes. Eddie took my resignation with equanimity. He said, \"I knew you weren't cut out for the caterin' industry the first time I clapped eyes on yer. You ain't got the wrists for it.\" I asked him in what way my wrists were deficient. He answered, \"They gotta be flexible for the butterin' and the fryin', an' your wrists are about as flexible as a lump of bleedin' coal.\" </p> <p> I related this conversation to Glenn as we prepared lobster nuggets for our dinner. He asked, \"What's a lump of coal?\" I said, \"It was a piece of black, shiny rock that we used to set fire to and burn in fireplaces.\" He laughed long and hard. The lad thinks that central heating has always been around. He probably thinks that Jesus had a double radiator in the manger. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday, December 3 </strong><br></p> <p> The rabble on the estate have formed themselves into a choir and are going from door to door demanding money for singing a few discordant notes of Slade's Merry Christmas Everybody. Those of us refusing to hand over a few silver coins are threatened that our wheelie bins will be pushed down the road and possibly overturned. I phoned Greg Dyke, our community policeman, but could only get his voicemail. </p> <p> <strong> Monday, December 4 </strong><br></p> <p> William has been chosen to play third shepherd in the school Nativity play. I went to Habitat tonight and bought him a new tea towel for his headdress. Only the best is good enough for my son.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tuesday, November 28, Ashby-de-la-Zouch My mother has signed up to be an Earth Watch volunteer. She is hoping to count birds migrating over a lake in Kenya. Frankly, I am disgusted. My mother is abusing a worthy conservation project. To my sure knowledge, she has never shown the slightest interest in birds, Kenya or counting. She is obviously hoping to get a free holiday. Earth Watch should be informed: she can't even count. The figures for migrating Kenyan birds could be hopelessly confused for years to come. This could lead to stress and trauma amongst ornithologists and their possible premature deaths. I confided in Glenn my worries about the orphans of the Kenyan ornithologists. He furrowed his brow: \"Why are you worrying about somethin' that 'asn't 'appened yet, Dad.\" I had no satisfactory answer. Later, my therapist, Angela House, asked me precisely the same question. Perhaps I should give her \u00a325 fee to Glenn. At least it would keep the money in the family, and save me the trouble of driving to Mrs House's house, thus avoiding the attendant parking problems and the embarrassment of overhearing Mr House urinating in the downstairs cloakroom. Wednesday, November 29 I rang my mother's house this morning, and was astonished and outraged to learn that she was in Paris! Ivan Braithwaite told me she had gone to the hotel where Oscar Wilde died 100 years ago this week. How dare she swan about on the Eurostar when people are starving? It is disgusting. Especially when it is me who is the Wildean expert. Few who saw it will ever forget my depiction of Lady Bracknell in the sex-swap performance of The Importance Of Being Earnest at Neil Armstrong Comprehensive School in 1982. Friday, December 1 Brick Eagleburger has asked his solicitor, Peter Elf, to take a civil action against the American government. Brick is now convinced that his postal vote has been violated. Apparently, Mr Elf was reluctant at first to take on the US, being more used to doing a little light conveyancing in the Hampton Wick area. Saturday, December 2 I have resigned from my position at Eddie's Layby Cafi. The work was very unfulfilling and I never properly came to terms with the constant smell of rancid fat on my clothes. Eddie took my resignation with equanimity. He said, \"I knew you weren't cut out for the caterin' industry the first time I clapped eyes on yer. You ain't got the wrists for it.\" I asked him in what way my wrists were deficient. He answered, \"They gotta be flexible for the butterin' and the fryin', an' your wrists are about as flexible as a lump of bleedin' coal.\" I related this conversation to Glenn as we prepared lobster nuggets for our dinner. He asked, \"What's a lump of coal?\" I said, \"It was a piece of black, shiny rock that we used to set fire to and burn in fireplaces.\" He laughed long and hard. The lad thinks that central heating has always been around. He probably thinks that Jesus had a double radiator in the manger. Sunday, December 3 The rabble on the estate have formed themselves into a choir and are going from door to door demanding money for singing a few discordant notes of Slade's Merry Christmas Everybody. Those of us refusing to hand over a few silver coins are threatened that our wheelie bins will be pushed down the road and possibly overturned. I phoned Greg Dyke, our community policeman, but could only get his voicemail. Monday, December 4 William has been chosen to play third shepherd in the school Nativity play. I went to Habitat tonight and bought him a new tea towel for his headdress. Only the best is good enough for my son.",

In both drawings, the grand turk has a grander erection. But just the one, and such a choice to spend it on ... It's the definitive, subversive image of male-imagined omnipotence in this wicked study of western fantasies, literary and pictorial, about the private life of Islam. </p> <p>The west got it all wrong, of course, even the name: the Turkish word haremlik means the place of sanctuary, the family side of the house. But the salacities started soon after the Ottomans swept in as the power challenging Europe from the east. True, the sultan kept the unlimited concubines allowed him by the Koran, and they did abide in discretion, if not total seclusion, in the saray (palace); but the west confused saray with the Italian serrare, to lock up, and conjured the seraglio as a whorehouse with Holloway-high security. Yeazell points out that the French and the English had the \"richest tradition of oriental fantasising\", perhaps because of their safe distance from janissary armies massing at the gates; and around 1700, they also had bric-a-brac from translations of the 1001 Nights, that compendium of dreams from medieval Baghdad and Cairo. </p> <p>As Yeazell enjoys noting, the protestant English - and even the French, post-Rousseau - had a monogamous official culture that made the pluralities of the Ottoman sultancy, sauced piquantly with cruelty, alluring to men. Travellers, playwrights, artists, the Marquis de Sade, Mozart and makers of cheesy films alike have all drawn on and contributed to the west's collective myth of the harem as a brothel in which hundreds - or, for greedy Byron, thousands - of enslaved beauties are implausibly expert at giving (seldom taking) sexual pleasure, despite the fact that their enforced dedication to a single master must have meant a chance to practise about once a year (those hints of lesbianism were introduced just to titillate males the more). </p> <p>The harem fantasy was as adaptable as its direct descendent, the Hollywood movie, to all manner of masculine bragging: the English sailor who multiply cuckolds the sultan and is paid in diamonds by the women for his services; Sade's cannibal Moor whose erotic despotism extends to punishing females who feel physical pleasure. It might even be presented as gallery art - consider the critics getting hard-ons in a Paris salon of 1862 while admiring the many tits in Ingres's The Turkish Bath. </p> <p>Yeazell notes that women also exploited the concept's gynocentricity. Mrs Delarivier Manley, in her 1706 play, Almyna, reworked the standard male plot of harem rivals jealous for the attentions of their lord into a drama of heroic sisterly devotion. Her contemporary Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, wife to an ambassador in Istanbul and with access to real haremlik, wrote sharply that whatever bullocking about there might be among Circassian palace slaves, no woman of quality would suffer a husband to take a second wife - slippers would be thrown with violent intent. Faroqhi's book, which is dense with detail from the same period, substantiates Lady M by citing a female merchant with her own warehouse, a woman dervish respected as a mystic, and Fitnat, a poet of wit and sexy innuendos. </p> <p>Yeazell writes that Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre knew well the love story of Roxelana, who persuaded Sultan Suleyman to marry her as sole consort at the height of Ottoman glory. After Jane discovered that Mr Rochester was a polygamist and keeper of serial continental concubines, she rejected his silks and jewels: \"If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul.\" We might speculate on whether Jane's serail would have been based on the voluptuous oils of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix or the unerotic watercolours of John Frederick Lewis, whose frightfully English wife posed in fancy dress among de luxe soft furnishings - more Liberty's than liberties. </p> <p>The real Roxelana, as fondly described by Freely, learned to write in order to communicate with her adored Suleyman while he was on campaign laying waste to Hungary: he put aside all other women for the rest of his days. After he had laid her in her exquisite tomb, two of their sons attempted to eliminate each other to become sole heir; Suleyman ordered the loser, and the loser's five sons -Suleyman's own grandchildren - executed. </p> <p>Freely narrates private lives beyond the Gate of Felicity in Topkapi Saray, Istanbul, in all their fearfulness, murderousness and dullness, although he is perhaps too close to the style of the Ottoman chronicles, enumerating how many offspring each sultan produced and how many years each princeling mouldered bored in the Cage, the semi-prison in which heirs awaited accession or death - 78 strangled with the silken bowstring in 450 years. </p> <p>He is at his most sympathetic when sneaking away from the gloomy pomp of the lords upon the Golden Horn and the realpolitik of the viziers to wander Topkapi palace, that permanent encampment blown through by damp salt winds. He quotes from a male English visitor who entered the temporarily deserted harem in the 1790s, only to find it \"in the state of an old lumber room ... large dusty pier glasses, neglected and broken, stood leaning against the wall ... scattered fragments of chandeliers and empty confectionery boxes were the only objects\".

      "body": "<p>Blackness. Three bright dots reveal themselves as heads; two women and a man, their bodies lost inside grey urns. They are a long way away. A harsh spotlight illuminates them, interrogates them as they speak, turn by turn and all at once. When silence falls, darkness falls with it. The light goes on and off. That is all there is, in essence, to Samuel Beckett's Play, first performed in Britain at the Old Vic in 1964. </p> <p>Anthony Minghella has recently filmed Play, with Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliet Stephenson and Alan Rickman, as part of a project to film all 19 Beckett plays. It is being touted as the first filmed production of Play. It is not. Comedie (Play in French) was filmed by Beckett himself, in 1966, working with a young French film-maker, Marin Karmitz. Then only 24, Karmitz had worked as an assistant to Roberto Rossellini and Jean-Luc Godard, and had made a film with Marguerite Duras before meeting, and being befriended by, Beckett. </p> <p>Comedie was shown, without success, at the 1966 Venice Film Biennale. Unseen since, it resurfaced this year, in Paris, in an exhibition called Voil\u00e0. Now it is at the Anthony Reynolds Gallery in London. According to Karmitz, in London this week, Beckett was wholly engaged in this magnificent, disturbing film production. This is not a stage play revisited - although Comedie is filmed with the cast of the original 1964 Paris stage production - but made as though film were its natural medium. </p> <p>A dark space. The screen fills the wall. The spotlit heads flash and burn. Michael Lonsdale, and El\u00e9onore Hirt and Delphine Seyrig, who flank him, are bright blobs, little more than flecks in the film's emulsion, the reflection on their urns faint after-images, grey against the irredeemable black. As the 18\u20ac-minute film progresses, they come closer, or perhaps we step into the dark towards them. Beckett, apparently, wanted the blackness to be as much a protagonist as a background, a consuming presence in a work which, transposed to cinema, also comes close to painting. He does in film what cannot be done on the page, or on the stage, or on the painted plane. </p> <p>The voices, too, are almost an abstraction; they speak, but we can unravel very little from the compressed babble. The odd, singu lar word erupts: a shriek, a stifled laugh, a scripted hiccup. Karmitz and Beckett worked on the sound first, eliminating the gaps between words electronically, condensing the delivery to a near indecipherable, riven music. The actors mime the playback, the pressurised condensation of their bile, as they seethe in their urns, along with their stew of memories, jealousy, bitchery and bitterness. </p> <p>Comedie becomes much more than the farcical depiction of a triangular relationship. It is a dynamic of spaces and distances, unbridgeable gulfs of time, space and intimacy. Sometimes the camera brings us too close. The man's face is a leonine sun, then the disappearing, decaying dot on a TV screen. Heads loom, out of scale, against their fellows, who appear like diminutive, mummified pupae. As Comedie progresses, there is a greying of the light, as though the heads were fuzzed with mould, like rotting peaches. The soundtrack becomes scratchy. Comedie is an endless cycle of rejections and recriminations. And like any bitter relationship, it goes over its ground again and again. Towards the end of the work, Beckett offers a direction to repeat the entire text, to do it again - and, the implication is, again and again. </p> <p>Comedie is filled with excruciating things. It is also bizarre and funny. Pared back to the irreducible, the symmetry of the relationship is reflected in the space of the film, the clustering of the line of heads, the grey bulk of their urns in the field of blackness. Under the shifting, inquisitorial spotlight, the grim melody of speech reduced to squirts and barks and babble is almost baby talk, the clay urns like swaddling clothes. The trio are like three writhing maggots. It is a primal scene. </p> <p>Of course, Comedie has dated, but only in inessentials. There are moments when you see those disembodied heads, the kohl-rimmed eyes, the raggedy Weetabix mop-top wigs and hairdos, in stark chiaroscuro, and you think of the cover of With the Beatles, from 1963. The film's technique may have been superseded, yet, shown in a gallery, Comedie could almost be a film installation by any number of contemporary artists. Except of course it is better, more radical, more extreme than most. Artists have, for a long time, been interested in Beckett's forays into film, his pieces for television (filmed brilliantly in Germany in the late 1970s and early 1980s). Not I, with Billie Whitelaw's mollusc-like wet mouth filling the screen, remains one of the most radical works ever produced for television. </p> <p>Beckett's friendship with artists and interest in art is well-known. Many artists now would claim him for their own. A recent exhibition in Vienna concentrated on the relationship between Beckett's work and American artist Bruce Nauman, and in London there is currently a two-part show of younger European artists, influenced by, and paying their dues to, Beckett. Karmitz believes Beckett would be happy to see his works in this context, and that this is the right way to show Comedie. In the dark space of the gallery, film, set, stage and installation coincide. Our relationship to the screen is physical. We are not so much watching something, as inside it, in some transitional darkness of our own. The DVD projection can't quite emulate the precise yet infinitely nuanced gradations of texture and tonality of 35mm film, but Comedie still makes your hair stand on end. </p> <p> Comedie is a rejoinder to the current project to film all Beckett's plays. Coming across a publicity still from Minghella's forthcoming film version of Play, I am horrified. It shows a field of urns in a dismal swamp, a gnarled, blasted oak in the background, a lowering, Chernobyl sky. Any minute, expect a dragon. This is adolescent, and worse, cliched and illustrational. Damien Hirst might be filming Beckett's painfully terse Breath (approximately: a stage littered with rubbish, a cry, another cry, curtain), and I can see a certain inevitability about this, but the current Beckett project fills me with dread. Not because Beckett is untouchable, but that he was so good, so rigorous, so exact in what he wanted and what he didn't want (these are not the same at all, yet taken together, they amount to his intention). Karmitz receives but one passing footnote in all the Beckett biographies. Comedie, itself passed over, largely unseen and unremarked by Beckett's commentators, has escaped its own urn at just the right moment. </p> <p>\u0095 Comedie, Anthony Reynolds Gallery (020-7491 0621), London W1, until December 23, and from January 3-13.</p>",

Our relationship to the screen is physical. We are not so much watching something, as inside it, in some transitional darkness of our own. The DVD projection can't quite emulate the precise yet infinitely nuanced gradations of texture and tonality of 35mm film, but Comedie still makes your hair stand on end. Comedie is a rejoinder to the current project to film all Beckett's plays. Coming across a publicity still from Minghella's forthcoming film version of Play, I am horrified. It shows a field of urns in a dismal swamp, a gnarled, blasted oak in the background, a lowering, Chernobyl sky. Any minute, expect a dragon. This is adolescent, and worse, cliched and illustrational. Damien Hirst might be filming Beckett's painfully terse Breath (approximately: a stage littered with rubbish, a cry, another cry, curtain), and I can see a certain inevitability about this, but the current Beckett project fills me with dread. Not because Beckett is untouchable, but that he was so good, so rigorous, so exact in what he wanted and what he didn't want (these are not the same at all, yet taken together, they amount to his intention). Karmitz receives but one passing footnote in all the Beckett biographies. Comedie, itself passed over, largely unseen and unremarked by Beckett's commentators, has escaped its own urn at just the right moment. \u0095 Comedie, Anthony Reynolds Gallery (020-7491 0621), London W1, until December 23, and from January 3-13.",

He knows what Freud felt and sometimes openly admitted, that the world's age-old gathering of insight into human nature is stored in its literature, that poets are and always have been what Shelley once called them, \"the unacknowledged legislators of the world\" - priest-like expounders of sacred mysteries, \"unapprehended inspiration\". Accordingly, he writes and speaks with wary, foot-in-both-camps precision and care, acutely aware of the paradox of language: that it lies, falsifies and invents in order to reveal. </p> <p>All our lives contain an innate tension between what we want to be and what events, contingency and the world seem to wish us to become. We are \"translated\" - to use the term of Phillips's astute Gwyn Jones Memorial lecture \"On Translating A Person\" - from our original selves by external circumstances, inner trauma. This sense that the lives we live are often damagingly and diminishingly different from the ones we are capable of living lies at the heart of psychoanalysis, which promises what (in different and often zealously competing ways) both Christianity and Marxism also promise: redemption through self-education, wholeness through self-knowledge. To psychoanalysis, the inner life is always, also, a potential life - an ample but unlived-out existence which the analyst can help the patient first to uncover and then, if circumstances are propitious, to recover and make real. </p> <p>The difficulty with this, as Phillips sees in a long, coolly penetrating essay on \"Poetry and Psychoanalysis\", is its fundamental generic resemblance to the processes of fiction, and fiction's dependence on the security and concreteness of language. What we know, in any field, is largely what we are able formally to express, and the telling of stories is history's most articulately evolved medium for the expression of human psychology and behaviour. Freud, imaginatively abasing himself before the works of Sophocles, Shakespeare and Goethe, understood this humiliatingly well and perhaps always yearned for some of literature's flawless linguistic and philosophical coherence. On the page, the best of his work astonishes us by the miraculous lucidity of its understanding. We read it as Shelley thought we should read poetry, apprehending beneath the literal, apparent meaning a profound, universalising genius, able to mirror, in some uncanny and shamanistic way, \"the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present\". Perhaps what Freud really did was to write the explicit and single-minded parables of hunger and erotomania that literature had not yet written, or had balked at writing during long centuries of Pauline Christian conditioning. Although he ranked himself with Copernicus and Darwin, perhaps we should put him alongside Ibsen, Strindberg, Joyce and Lawrence. </p> <p>Behind Phillips's fine, discursive book lies a fundamental, informing uneasiness that psychoanalysis may be pretending to an authority that it cannot ultimately possess. When Phillips describes Freud as writing \"science which sounded like literature\", it is possible to go further and argue that psychoanalytic theory is actually literature dressed up as scientific investigation. Art's strength is metaphorical: it works by analogy, by reorganisation and rearrangement, and has the freedom and irresponsibility of thought itself. Psychoanalysis claims to be essentially a science: to proceed, like physics, by broadly verifiable laws and to embody some sort of literal truth. The drawbacks of this for clinical medicine seem obvious. Freud's doctrine of the powerful unconscious has taught us increasingly to interpret illness in metaphorical terms, yet to resist the idea that diagnostic emotional suppositions may not be hard fact. As Lewis Wolpert, in his recent superb study of depression, Malignant Sadness, observes: \"It is curious that conversion disorders, made so famous by Freud, in which emotional conflict was converted into, for example, blindness, deafness or paralysis, seem nowadays to be very rare. One possibility is that many of the cases were indeed due to a physical disorder.\" </p> <p>Conversion is the essence of psychoanalysis, as well as of language itself. Both try to resolve the contradictions of being alive through alchemical transformations, wresting new securities from the chaos of old and rooted griefs, calming the mind's ever-threatening anarchy through narratives that channel our experience and hold it in a kind of tense but apparent orderliness. Sophocles's Heracles, in Ezra Pound's far-sighted translation, cries out, at the supreme moment of his life, in a half-mad ecstasy of emotional recognition: \"It all coheres.\" </p> <p>Freud believed this too. It's not surprising that he saw dreams as a kind of art, a \"royal road to the unconscious\" that could be read, picked apart and diligently expounded as though the analyst were a supremely authoritative literary critic. It was his most seductive experiment, and easily the most fallacious. Art can be experienced by anyone able to receive it; dreams can be experienced by no one but the dreamer. Even our memory of them is a reorganisation of the material by a meaning-obsessed waking consciousness. Freud knew this, of course - he calls the process \"secondary elaboration\" - but, in his driven, Messianic, Sherlock Holmes-ish way, couldn't bring himself to abandon the formal beauty of the system he had created. In truth, the magico-religious cultures of the ancient world probably got closer to decoding the mysterious dialect of dreams than he did. </p> <p>The continually impressive thing about Phillips's work is its refusal to disregard the human costs of systems, theories and dogmatic verbal structures. He always earths argument in lived experience. Occasionally this caution lends to his precisely articulated prose a distant or monochromatic note, but it proceeds from an admirable distaste for the vibrato of fake wisdom to which linguistic stylishness is notoriously prone. In a review of Martin Amis's novel, Night Train, he writes: \"The effect of his often brilliant verbal delirium is to make things wordy and unreal, language warding off the experience it describes, whisking it away.\" It's a mistake Phillips takes pains not to make himself. </p> <p>For him, the work of Freud and the other great psychological thinkers is more imaginatively enabling than it is empirically accurate or \"true\". Consequently he argues for a version of analysis \"more committed to happiness and inspiration (and the miscellaneous) than to self-knowledge, rigorous thinking, or the Depths of Being\". To Phillips, the real promise of psychoanalysis is to widen our language rather than to extend our science. Freud's ground-breaking gift - despite its denial of the historical or collective in favour of the internal - was to make it possible for us to say things about our minds, our consciousness, that had never been said before, or never said in such specific, unhysterical, anatomising detail. He gave us secular classifications for areas of our being that had been assumed to lie beyond the scope of secular classification. Or, in Phillips's liberating terms, he freed us to translate ourselves and be translated. \"On Translating A Person\" might have been a better and more accurate title for this richly thought-provoking book.</p>",

But the Halifax research found that this, too, is a myth. </p> <p>In recent years, the level of home ownership has levelled out in the UK at around 67%. However, in both Spain and Italy, which do not have the same northern European tradition of public housing, the level is 78%. One of the lowest levels of home ownership is in the Netherlands, at 50%, even though the mortgage market is similar to the UK. In Germany, where rent controls are widespread, the financial equation behind house buying stacks up poorly. Only four in 10 Germans own the home they live in, but tend to have greater security on both tenure and rent increases on their properties. In France 54% own the homes they live in. </p> <p><strong> Prices</strong> : Anyone who thinks Britain is alone in suffering a boom and bust house price cycle is wrong. Halifax compared price rises during the period 1990-98 across seven countries, and found that prices had risen slower in Britain than anywhere else. </p> <p>In the UK, prices rose by an average of 6.4%, compared to a staggering 81% increase in the Netherlands. However, the British figure was deflated by the period chosen, as it covered much of the post-1980s property slump and before the recent price boom came into play. </p> <p>Price rises in France and Sweden were equally sluggish, but Spanish homeowners enjoyed an increase of 27%, while in Germany the gain was 37%. </p> <p><strong> Repayment periods</strong>: In Britain, most people take out mortgages which will be paid off over a 25-year repayment period, but it is by no means the standard for Europe. In the Netherlands, it is usual to repay over a 30-year period, while in Spain the typical length of a mortgage is only 15 years - making loans much more costly. </p> <p>How much you have to stump up as a deposit also varies across Europe. Whereas in Britain most first-time buyers need to put down a 5% deposit, in Spain they have to find 20%. In Holland, 125% mortgages are common, so homebuyers do not have to put up a deposit at all. </p> <p><strong> Tax</strong> : European tax harmonisation on mortgages is a long, long way off. Whereas Britain has simplified its tax regime by abolishing mortgage interest relief, it still has one of the most favourable capital gains tax regimes in Europe for homeowners. When you sell your home in Britain, there is no tax to pay on the gain over the price you originally paid. However, both France and Holland charge tax on the gains made. </p> <p><strong> Types of mortgage:</strong> Fixes, discounts, caps, variable, flexible or tracker; the British homebuyer has a daunting array of products to choose from. However, in a number of northern EU countries, long-term fixed rate mortgages are the only products on offer. In Spain and Italy, countries with a poor inflation record in the past, variable rate mortgages are the norm. </p> <p><strong>Gains in Spain stay mainly on the plane</strong><br><strong>Tony Levene</strong></p> <p>Home loan rates in Spain average a bargain basement 4.9%, according to Halifax statistics. So it is less than plain why Norwich &amp; Peterborough is asking Brits to pay 6.99% on fixed rate for five years on loans to buy homes on the Spanish Costa del Sol. </p> <p>And it is seemingly even more unfair why it goes up to 8% after that. A five-year UK fixed mortgage costs 6.39%. </p> <p>But N&amp;P, which lends in Gibraltar and along the Costa del Sol, is not alone. Lenders such as Abbey National, Halifax, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Woolwich all charge around 7.75%. The interest rate premium is in exchange for simplicity and risk reduction. Many Spanish banks will not lend to non-residents who, typically, fail local credit tests. </p> <p>And according to N&amp;P, the risks and potential hassles of a euro-based mortgage could make Spanish loans more expensive in the long run. </p> <p>\"If the euro strengthens against the pound, sterling- based borrowers will need to find more both for monthly interest and capital repayment,\" says N&amp;P's Alison Rolls. A terraced property with a shared swimming pool costs \u00a370,000, while villas with private pools average \u00a3108,000.

Lenders such as Abbey National, Halifax, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Woolwich all charge around 7.75%. The interest rate premium is in exchange for simplicity and risk reduction. Many Spanish banks will not lend to non-residents who, typically, fail local credit tests. And according to N&amp;P, the risks and potential hassles of a euro-based mortgage could make Spanish loans more expensive in the long run. \"If the euro strengthens against the pound, sterling- based borrowers will need to find more both for monthly interest and capital repayment,\" says N&amp;P's Alison Rolls. A terraced property with a shared swimming pool costs \u00a370,000, while villas with private pools average \u00a3108,000. Buyers tend to put down large deposits say 40% and pay off loans over 17 years.",

It drains good cheer from my soul. It casts a shadow over life. It blights each day. This may seem extreme, but I have good reasons - the very reasons that any amateur party organiser must experience. </p> <p>We, at Weekend Guardian, are a tightly-knit team. I wouldn't go quite as far as to say that we are a family, unless you think of a family like the Sopranos. Anyway, we toil away during the year, uncomplaining, unheralded and unfussed and then, come December, suddenly it's party time. \"Matthew,\" the cry goes up, \"where shall we have the Christmas party this year?\" Where indeed? How should I know? </p> <p>You see, our kind of party is a particular kind of party. It's not a dance party, or a drugs and sex party, or even a pyjama party. It's a kind of lunch party, although that suggests something altogether too orderly and polite. But there has to be eating and drinking, and of a certain quality. You wouldn't expect me to agree to anything less, would you? Hangovers are all very well in their way, but experience has taught me that the degree and pain of a hangover are in direct relation to the quality of the vittels, solid and liquid, consumed. Basically, Fort's theory of the hangover is that the lower the quality of the food and booze, the worse the hangover. Anyway, my confr\u00e8res et soeurs on the magazine have come to expect a high standard, and I am loath to disappoint. </p> <p>There are a few free spirits who float in and out of the quorum, depending on pressure of work, but generally speaking our numbers vary between 18 and 24. But within this tight pod of Weekenders, we have a rainbow coalition of gastronomic tastes. There are fish lovers, unreconstructed vegetarians, offal aficionados and meat epicureans. We have people who worship Italian food, and those who have a yen for something plain and British. There are the pickiest of pickies and the most gourmandising of trencherfolk. There are oenophiles and beeromaniacs. And they all expect me to come up with somewhere that will meet their particular dietary requirements. </p> <p>Fair enough, you may say, but let me tell you that the responsibility is crippling. They all want to have a good time, too, a noisy time, a tombola-and-lucky-dip time, a leisurely, pleasurely time. They want good food and fun. And they'll rend me limb from limb if I don't come up with the goods. Oh, and we can't spend more than half a euro per head on it. That's the official budget line. Are you beginning to appreciate the scale of my problem? They will be familiar to anyone also caught in the Christmas party organising trap. </p> <p>In the past, we have put L'Od\u00e9on through its paces, and Kensington Place. For two years, we have given the Blue Print Cafe a going over. And there was one memorable year when we went to Maison Novelli, although the reasons for that occasion's noteworthiness I shall leave to your imaginations. This year, it's the turn of Mash in Great Portland Street, because it fulfils the profile that I have been developing year by year for the perfect Weekend Christmas Party. The rules are quite simple: </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Don't go anywhere near your own doorstep. You don't want to have to run the gauntlet of accusing faces for weeks to come for incidents of which you have no memory; </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> Make sure it's sufficiently roomy to handle a large number of people sitting down to eat at once; </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> If possible, get a private room. Then, no one (except the waiting staff, that is) will notice how abominably you behave; </p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> Check in advance that there's sufficient variety on the menu to satisfy even the most arcane of diets; </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> Order wine, beer and water to be on the table when you arrive. And no rubbish, please. The relaxation that drink induces will make your party revellers tolerate an extraordinary amount; </p> <p> <strong> 6</strong> Keep an eye on the level of alcohol consumption before the first courses arrive. You don't want things getting out of hand too quickly. So make sure those starters make an early appearance; </p> <p> <strong> 7</strong> Be prepared to go over budget. In the end, it's not your money; </p> <p> <strong> 8</strong> Make detailed notes of serious misbehaviour. Knowledge is power. </p> <p>Anyway, here are a few places around the country that I know - either from personal experience or good report - meet the various criteria outlined above. I would be happy to land the motley Weekend crowd on any of them, and be sure of having good food and a good time.

There are oenophiles and beeromaniacs. And they all expect me to come up with somewhere that will meet their particular dietary requirements. Fair enough, you may say, but let me tell you that the responsibility is crippling. They all want to have a good time, too, a noisy time, a tombola-and-lucky-dip time, a leisurely, pleasurely time. They want good food and fun. And they'll rend me limb from limb if I don't come up with the goods. Oh, and we can't spend more than half a euro per head on it. That's the official budget line. Are you beginning to appreciate the scale of my problem? They will be familiar to anyone also caught in the Christmas party organising trap. In the past, we have put L'Od\u00e9on through its paces, and Kensington Place. For two years, we have given the Blue Print Cafe a going over. And there was one memorable year when we went to Maison Novelli, although the reasons for that occasion's noteworthiness I shall leave to your imaginations. This year, it's the turn of Mash in Great Portland Street, because it fulfils the profile that I have been developing year by year for the perfect Weekend Christmas Party. The rules are quite simple: 1 Don't go anywhere near your own doorstep. You don't want to have to run the gauntlet of accusing faces for weeks to come for incidents of which you have no memory; 2 Make sure it's sufficiently roomy to handle a large number of people sitting down to eat at once; 3 If possible, get a private room. Then, no one (except the waiting staff, that is) will notice how abominably you behave; 4 Check in advance that there's sufficient variety on the menu to satisfy even the most arcane of diets; 5 Order wine, beer and water to be on the table when you arrive. And no rubbish, please. The relaxation that drink induces will make your party revellers tolerate an extraordinary amount; 6 Keep an eye on the level of alcohol consumption before the first courses arrive. You don't want things getting out of hand too quickly. So make sure those starters make an early appearance; 7 Be prepared to go over budget. In the end, it's not your money; 8 Make detailed notes of serious misbehaviour. Knowledge is power. Anyway, here are a few places around the country that I know - either from personal experience or good report - meet the various criteria outlined above. I would be happy to land the motley Weekend crowd on any of them, and be sure of having good food and a good time. What more do you want?

A spokesman insisted that the Northern Ireland secretary had not spoken out of line after it was reported that Mr Mandelson had questioned the impartiality of Mr Bush, who has won the support of two pro-Sinn Fein congressmen in his battle for the White House. \"It is a fuss about nothing,\" the Downing Street spokesman said. \"Peter Mandelson said, in terms, that were George Bush to become president we are totally confident he would continue to be even-handed.\" Downing Street intervened after it was reported in last night's London Evening Standard that Mr Mandelson had suggested at a Westminster reception on Thursday night that Mr Bush sympathised with Sinn Fein. Mr Mandelson reportedly pointed out that Mr Bush had adopted a nationalist stance on Northern Ireland earlier this year to win the support of two congressmen in his battle against John McCain to win the Republican nomination. Peter King and Ben Gilman threw their weight behind Mr Bush after he backed nationalist demands for the full implementation of the Patten report on policing.

      "body": "<p>Working from home can be lonely and sometimes as stressful as sticking with the nine-to-five office job. </p> <p>Homeworkers can find themselves cut off from the daily social interaction that comes with going out to work and there is no escape from the phone and computer as the desk in the spare room becomes the centre of the house. </p> <p>Industry minister Patricia Hewitt told a conference in September that the UK should be able to get a third of its workforce teleworking for at least part of the time. Other studies by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found one in four UK workers now do some of their job from home. </p> <p>Many full-time homeworkers move their computers, files and desks out of the house and into shared offices. But the monthly rental payments mean this can be expensive. Conservatories and cabins in the garden can't bring back the office banter, but they do take the work out of the house and cabin makers report that business is booming. </p> <p>Norwegian Log and Homelodge Buildings claim demand for their wooden cabins has never been higher. The companies' brochures say the buildings make successful offices for everyone, from artists and music teachers to physiotherapists. </p> <p>Norwegian Log's solid log buildings, that typically measure 15 feet by 12 feet, cost about \u00a312,000 plus VAT and come ready wired for teleworking. Nick Forrester, Norwegian Log director, says planning permission is not usually required. </p> <p>Homelodge make double-glazed, pre-fabricated buildings with lights, power points, a heater and even kitchen units and water heater where requested. The building, which sits on concrete padstones, is assembled on site. </p> <p>For many small business men and women, however, living above their place of work, rather than building it in the back garden, is the norm. </p> <p>Before the internet found its way into the nation's spare bedrooms, working from home usually meant living above the shop. Bakers and grocers, for instance, donned an apron and walked downstairs to begin the daily grind. </p> <p>There are still thousands of opportunities to live and work in the same place. And the canny small businessperson can snap up a bargain flat and business in desirable areas for less than the cost of a standalone apartment. </p> <p>Buyers on the look out for a complete change - a guaranteed salary and an inexpensive home in a prime location - might want to consider running a post office. The idea is not as outlandish as it seems for the commercially minded. Sub-postmasters and mistresses receive a salary, plus, where there is a retail business attached, additional in come from the newsagency or corner shop. </p> <p>There are almost 19,000 post offices around the UK, many of them in high-priced areas. In London's Notting Hill, a post office with a one-bedroom flat is on the market for just \u00a3100,000.

      "bodyText": "Working from home can be lonely and sometimes as stressful as sticking with the nine-to-five office job. Homeworkers can find themselves cut off from the daily social interaction that comes with going out to work and there is no escape from the phone and computer as the desk in the spare room becomes the centre of the house. Industry minister Patricia Hewitt told a conference in September that the UK should be able to get a third of its workforce teleworking for at least part of the time. Other studies by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found one in four UK workers now do some of their job from home. Many full-time homeworkers move their computers, files and desks out of the house and into shared offices. But the monthly rental payments mean this can be expensive. Conservatories and cabins in the garden can't bring back the office banter, but they do take the work out of the house and cabin makers report that business is booming. Norwegian Log and Homelodge Buildings claim demand for their wooden cabins has never been higher. The companies' brochures say the buildings make successful offices for everyone, from artists and music teachers to physiotherapists. Norwegian Log's solid log buildings, that typically measure 15 feet by 12 feet, cost about \u00a312,000 plus VAT and come ready wired for teleworking. Nick Forrester, Norwegian Log director, says planning permission is not usually required. Homelodge make double-glazed, pre-fabricated buildings with lights, power points, a heater and even kitchen units and water heater where requested. The building, which sits on concrete padstones, is assembled on site. For many small business men and women, however, living above their place of work, rather than building it in the back garden, is the norm. Before the internet found its way into the nation's spare bedrooms, working from home usually meant living above the shop. Bakers and grocers, for instance, donned an apron and walked downstairs to begin the daily grind. There are still thousands of opportunities to live and work in the same place. And the canny small businessperson can snap up a bargain flat and business in desirable areas for less than the cost of a standalone apartment. Buyers on the look out for a complete change - a guaranteed salary and an inexpensive home in a prime location - might want to consider running a post office. The idea is not as outlandish as it seems for the commercially minded. Sub-postmasters and mistresses receive a salary, plus, where there is a retail business attached, additional in come from the newsagency or corner shop. There are almost 19,000 post offices around the UK, many of them in high-priced areas. In London's Notting Hill, a post office with a one-bedroom flat is on the market for just \u00a3100,000. The new owner would receive an income of \u00a348,000 for running the business. Even the most committed bargain hunters would probably balk at becoming a sub-postmaster or mistress in order to get their hands on a nice flat.

At 7pm on a week night rain streamed down cobbled streets and six 13-year-old girls with their wet fringes plastered to their foreheads stood opposite the 24-hour garage talking about hairstyles. Raindrops poured off their noses on to tracksuit tops zipped up over their chins. They pulled down the zips to suck on a cigarette. They probably didn't notice the words \"shitty\" and \"mortar\" carved into the sides of gritstone houses overlooking the valley. They were bored.</p> <p>Haslingden is a beautiful town, but there's nothing to do there if you're 12.</p> <p>The town is half a mile wide and three miles long. It is mostly white working class, with middle-class pockets and an Asian population of 5%. The nearest McDonald's, which opened three years ago, is a 10-minute bus ride, but the bus service isn't great and buses are expensive. The nearest cinema is eight miles up the motorway. You can't get a bus there and back at night, and even if you could, you couldn't afford it.</p> <p>So teenagers go out into the street at night and talk. They start aged 11 and keep doing it until 18, mostly congregating in groups of 20 or 30 in the market place, the park, the cemetery, the patch behind the swimming baths, the car park behind the garage or outside the chip shop. Some smoke, some drink beer. A few sniff solvents, some smoke joints - but for this they disappear into smaller groups.</p> <p>Boys and girls congregate together although the girls sometimes break off in clusters to talk about the boys, and the boys sometimes break off to talk about DVDs. They send text messages. They usually bring some form of wheels: rollerblades, bikes. This year, it's scooters, although the cobbles aren't good for it. Skateboarders hope they get a lift to Accrington where there's a specially designed skate park.</p> <p>The routine is have tea with your parents, leave the house at 6pm, and hang out until 9pm or sometimes later.</p> <p>Anne Bullock, a senior youth worker at the Haslingden youth club, has worked with local teenagers for 15 years, mainly out on in the street at night. She said there was no profile of a single type of teenager outside. Some were wealthy, others weren't, but few carried much cash with them. Some as young as 11 were heavy drinkers, but often their parents would stop by to ask if they were having a good time, before going off to their own entertainment. Other parents knew their children were out and imposed their own curfews, usually 9 or 10pm.</p> <p>Last Saturday, Kerry, 14, left her house at 6:30pm to stand on a pavement for three hours in the biting cold with three friends. They chatted. Her friend made a list of the good and bad points of boys she liked. They put them in rank order. They got bored and went home.</p> <p>When the girls go out at night, up winding streets, past the antique clock shop and bakery with fairy lights in the window, they find a spot to stand in and just gossip \"because there's nowhere else, except outside in the street\". Kerry wants to be an air hostess. Her favourite subject is maths. Her friend, Zoe, 15, has just finished three English courseworks. She wants to be a hairdresser or a vet. They like pop, garage and Eminem.</p> <p>\"We hang out, we doss around and we chat. We have fun. It's a laugh, except it's freezing outside,\" she said. When it rains, they still go out - \"otherwise we'd get bored\" - but they stand in covered alleyways, which they don't tell anyone about in case they steal their spot. They don't go to the park with the others because it's dark and it spooks them. But they have chatted in the cemetery. They would never walk around alone at night, so Kerry brings her 13-year-old brother if she's worried. They usually go home at 9:30pm. Some of their friends stay out til 11 or 12.</p> <p>Kerry works part-time in a hairdresser's. \"That's good because it keeps me off the streets,\" she said. Zoe can't find a job. \"I did go to the sandwich shop to ask, but it was shut,\" she said.</p> <p>Kerry, like most Haslingden residents between 11 and 17 lives for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights, when the youth club, H20, is open from 7:15pm to 9:30pm in a converted pub with designer decor, new snooker table and internet link up. They go there at 5:30pm and \"hang out\" outside until it opens. \"The only good thing about this town is the youth club,\" said Zoe. \"We can hang out with the Asian boys, which we can't do anywhere else because it's against their religion. Apart from the club, there is nothing here. And it's not open on Saturday. We like to go out. We don't want to die of boredom.\"</p> <p>Any mass of teenagers on the streets is seen as a nuisance to residents. There was recently an exchange of letters in the local newspaper, the Rossendale Free Press, following reports that a handful of teenagers in one part of Haslingden had been running riot on an estate full of pensioners. Some believed that teenagers had set fire to cars. Letters poured in. Steve Roman, district manager of the Lancashire Youth and Community Service, responded by assuring the paper that the majority of young teens who just chat outside at night would respond well to any calls to keep the noise down and move on. His letter was published under the heading, \"Respect the yobbos\".</p> <p>\"Being young is not a crime,\" said Mr Roman. \"Most teenagers resent being stereotyped as hooligans, especially when they are keen for any activities the council can provide.\"</p> <p>This week, the Queen's speech included plans to impose after-dark curfews on teenagers up to 16. Powers to ban under 10s from public places between 9pm and 6am came into force under the Crime and Disorder Act in 1998, but have never been used in England. In Scotland, the age limit is already 16 and police have powers to question any teenager found on the streets after dark. If no good explanation is given, the teenager is taken home. If there is no one at home, they are kept at the police station until their parents return. The curfew scheme tested in Hamilton, in Lanarkshire, is currently being evaluated, but councillors claim youth crime is down.</p> <p><b> Generation gap</b></p> <p>There is debate as to the precise form and time limit of the curfews that will appear in the crime bill early next year.

      "bodyText": "Haslingden is like any other small mill town in Lancashire. At 7pm on a week night rain streamed down cobbled streets and six 13-year-old girls with their wet fringes plastered to their foreheads stood opposite the 24-hour garage talking about hairstyles. Raindrops poured off their noses on to tracksuit tops zipped up over their chins. They pulled down the zips to suck on a cigarette. They probably didn't notice the words \"shitty\" and \"mortar\" carved into the sides of gritstone houses overlooking the valley. They were bored. Haslingden is a beautiful town, but there's nothing to do there if you're 12. The town is half a mile wide and three miles long. It is mostly white working class, with middle-class pockets and an Asian population of 5%. The nearest McDonald's, which opened three years ago, is a 10-minute bus ride, but the bus service isn't great and buses are expensive. The nearest cinema is eight miles up the motorway. You can't get a bus there and back at night, and even if you could, you couldn't afford it. So teenagers go out into the street at night and talk. They start aged 11 and keep doing it until 18, mostly congregating in groups of 20 or 30 in the market place, the park, the cemetery, the patch behind the swimming baths, the car park behind the garage or outside the chip shop. Some smoke, some drink beer. A few sniff solvents, some smoke joints - but for this they disappear into smaller groups. Boys and girls congregate together although the girls sometimes break off in clusters to talk about the boys, and the boys sometimes break off to talk about DVDs. They send text messages. They usually bring some form of wheels: rollerblades, bikes. This year, it's scooters, although the cobbles aren't good for it. Skateboarders hope they get a lift to Accrington where there's a specially designed skate park. The routine is have tea with your parents, leave the house at 6pm, and hang out until 9pm or sometimes later. Anne Bullock, a senior youth worker at the Haslingden youth club, has worked with local teenagers for 15 years, mainly out on in the street at night. She said there was no profile of a single type of teenager outside. Some were wealthy, others weren't, but few carried much cash with them. Some as young as 11 were heavy drinkers, but often their parents would stop by to ask if they were having a good time, before going off to their own entertainment. Other parents knew their children were out and imposed their own curfews, usually 9 or 10pm. Last Saturday, Kerry, 14, left her house at 6:30pm to stand on a pavement for three hours in the biting cold with three friends. They chatted. Her friend made a list of the good and bad points of boys she liked. They put them in rank order. They got bored and went home. When the girls go out at night, up winding streets, past the antique clock shop and bakery with fairy lights in the window, they find a spot to stand in and just gossip \"because there's nowhere else, except outside in the street\". Kerry wants to be an air hostess. Her favourite subject is maths. Her friend, Zoe, 15, has just finished three English courseworks. She wants to be a hairdresser or a vet. They like pop, garage and Eminem. \"We hang out, we doss around and we chat. We have fun. It's a laugh, except it's freezing outside,\" she said. When it rains, they still go out - \"otherwise we'd get bored\" - but they stand in covered alleyways, which they don't tell anyone about in case they steal their spot. They don't go to the park with the others because it's dark and it spooks them. But they have chatted in the cemetery. They would never walk around alone at night, so Kerry brings her 13-year-old brother if she's worried. They usually go home at 9:30pm. Some of their friends stay out til 11 or 12. Kerry works part-time in a hairdresser's. \"That's good because it keeps me off the streets,\" she said. Zoe can't find a job. \"I did go to the sandwich shop to ask, but it was shut,\" she said. Kerry, like most Haslingden residents between 11 and 17 lives for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights, when the youth club, H20, is open from 7:15pm to 9:30pm in a converted pub with designer decor, new snooker table and internet link up. They go there at 5:30pm and \"hang out\" outside until it opens. \"The only good thing about this town is the youth club,\" said Zoe. \"We can hang out with the Asian boys, which we can't do anywhere else because it's against their religion. Apart from the club, there is nothing here. And it's not open on Saturday. We like to go out. We don't want to die of boredom.\" Any mass of teenagers on the streets is seen as a nuisance to residents. There was recently an exchange of letters in the local newspaper, the Rossendale Free Press, following reports that a handful of teenagers in one part of Haslingden had been running riot on an estate full of pensioners. Some believed that teenagers had set fire to cars. Letters poured in. Steve Roman, district manager of the Lancashire Youth and Community Service, responded by assuring the paper that the majority of young teens who just chat outside at night would respond well to any calls to keep the noise down and move on. His letter was published under the heading, \"Respect the yobbos\". \"Being young is not a crime,\" said Mr Roman. \"Most teenagers resent being stereotyped as hooligans, especially when they are keen for any activities the council can provide.\" This week, the Queen's speech included plans to impose after-dark curfews on teenagers up to 16. Powers to ban under 10s from public places between 9pm and 6am came into force under the Crime and Disorder Act in 1998, but have never been used in England. In Scotland, the age limit is already 16 and police have powers to question any teenager found on the streets after dark. If no good explanation is given, the teenager is taken home. If there is no one at home, they are kept at the police station until their parents return. The curfew scheme tested in Hamilton, in Lanarkshire, is currently being evaluated, but councillors claim youth crime is down. Generation gap There is debate as to the precise form and time limit of the curfews that will appear in the crime bill early next year. A Home Office spokesman said curfews will relate to areas, not individuals. Police can apply for a curfew order then remove all under 16s from a specific area, regardless of whether they are persistent offenders. This could be after 9pm, or it could be dusk until dawn. Defending the idea, Jack Straw, home secretary, asked: \"Why are there youngsters out on the streets at 10pm or 11pm? Where are their parents?\" In Haslingden, some teenagers' parents let them meet their friends outside until that time, then drive round and pick them up.

During three days, 78 elderly survivors - the largest ever gathering of comfort women - will testify in a Tokyo assembly hall about the rapes and beatings they suffered while serving as \"the emperor's gift to his troops\". A panel of eight prominent judges will also hear accounts by historians and veterans who used the army's brothels, the existence of which was denied by the Japanese government until 1993.

But there are signs that the company is tackling the issue. </p> <p>Analysts believe real recognition will come as Reminyl is rolled out across the world and the market looks at other drugs on the company's books. </p> <p>\"This is a company with a high growth potential and the management is doing all the right things,\" said one analyst. \"They are looking at acquisitions and addressing concerns about over-dependence. It's difficult to say what else they could be doing.\" </p> <p>On the downside, Shire is facing increasing competition and this is expected to impact on Adderall. </p> <p>It is also very strong in the US but relatively weaker in Europe and it is here the company needs to concentrate its efforts. </p> <p>There has been talk of further acquisitions but nothing definite appears to be in the sights of senior management. In the longer term, Shire is also expected to face questions over whether it can continue its current pace of growth without having a dedicated research department. </p> <p>Pharmaceuticals is a fast moving and exciting area for investors.

      "bodyText": "Doctors prescribed just the news that Shire Pharmaceuticals wanted to hear yesterday - confirmation that its Alzheimer's treatment Reminyl really is effective. The announcement lifted the shares 74p, a rise of almost 6%, to \u00a312.22 and the feeling is that there is still a long way for it to climb. The company, which elbowed its way into the FTSE 100 in October, is well regarded in the City where it is seen as a high-growth stock. But this has not always been reflected in its share price which has fluctuated between \u00a35.80 and \u00a315.08 over the past 12 months. Much has been made of its dependence on Adderall, the drug for attention deficit disorder, and it is true that this has held the share price back. But there are signs that the company is tackling the issue. Analysts believe real recognition will come as Reminyl is rolled out across the world and the market looks at other drugs on the company's books. \"This is a company with a high growth potential and the management is doing all the right things,\" said one analyst. \"They are looking at acquisitions and addressing concerns about over-dependence. It's difficult to say what else they could be doing.\" On the downside, Shire is facing increasing competition and this is expected to impact on Adderall. It is also very strong in the US but relatively weaker in Europe and it is here the company needs to concentrate its efforts. There has been talk of further acquisitions but nothing definite appears to be in the sights of senior management. In the longer term, Shire is also expected to face questions over whether it can continue its current pace of growth without having a dedicated research department. Pharmaceuticals is a fast moving and exciting area for investors. Rounds of consolidation have increased the opportunities for smaller, specialist companies to prosper. Buy.",

As Europe's trade czar, he was there when the Molotov cocktails were flying in Seattle and has watched as the backlash against globalisation has gained in strength. He is realistic about the challenge involved in putting trade liberalisation back on the agenda.\"The voice of the anti-globalisation forces are louder than they were\", he said. \"The politics of trade have not been moving in the right direction.\" </p> <p>A 53-year-old Frenchman, Lamy seems an unusual choice to fly the flag for free trade. After all, France is the most protectionist country in a continent that has a reputation for feather-bedding its producers. As someone who hails from heartland agricultural France - the cream and Calvados region of Normandy - he ought to be the protectionist's protectionist. But things are a bit more complex than that. </p> <p>While it's certainly true that Lamy is a socialist intellectual and a Brussels insider, he is also a confirmed anglophile. Stories abound about how he understands the American way of life and counts as his friends various members of the Anglo-Saxon great and good. </p> <p>One fact alone should suffice: Lamy is a Frenchman who understands the laws of cricket. </p> <p>He had the classic training of a French bureaucrat, graduating from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration and being spotted by Jacques Delors as a high-flyer in the early 80s. When Delors became EC president, Lamy was his chief of staff in Brussels between 1985 and 1994, before moving into the private sector to mastermind the restructuring of the ailing French bank, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais. </p> <p>Those who ran across Lamy describe him either as a consummate political operator or a thug. Either way, they are ideal qualities for the modern trade negotiator, as is his hobby - running marathons. </p> <p>Lamy is certainly aware that restarting the trade talks will be a real feat of endurance. Developed nations no longer go to war with guns; they fight trade wars with sanctions and counter-sanctions instead. And just as the first industrial revolution two centures ago caused democratic convulsions, so Lamy believes that globalisation is giving rise to justifiable calls for economic and political structures that can shape the modern age. </p> <p>\"Globalisation has its dark side and its bright side. The aim is to get more of the bright side, and that is a question of governance.Governance is running far behind globalisation.\" </p> <p>He says he agrees with many of the questions posed by those who took to the streets in Seattle and Prague. \"I have some sympathy with those who ask whether trade opening is good for sustainability in the broad sense of the word - be it economic, social or environmental. What I don't agree with is the sort of radical solution a number of the protesters are proposing.\" </p> <p>He says that making progress on trade is not just about getting the technical details right, but getting the politics right. While there has been plenty of backroom activity since Seattle, the political difficulties have yet to be addressed. The well founded fear that any future trade talks will result in violent clashes on the streets means that no city in the world is willing to host next year's routine ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>Even before Lamy gets to grips with the Americans and the Japanese, he has to persuade the member states of the European Union that they should remove the national veto from key areas of trade - services, patents and investment. </p> <p>While Lamy has been prepared to mix it with the Americans, threatening to impose $4bn of sanctions over the assistance - deemed illegal by the WTO - the US provides to exports from American multinationals, he has tried to lower the temperature between Brussels and Washington. </p> <p>But although the EU and the US are the world's two biggest markets, securing agreement on trade now involves much more than simply striking a deal between Washington and Brussels. Lamy's solution is twofold. First, the rich countries need to build trust among the least developed countries, something the commission is trying to do by offering duty free access to goods from the world's 48 poorest countries. This initiative has been attacked both from vested interests in Europe - particularly the multinational sugar corporations - and from some of the less-poor developing nations, who feel that they will lose out. </p> <p>Lamy's second idea is that the regional nature of the EU should be used as the template for future trade talks. The commission negotiates on behalf of all 15 EU countries, and there is no reason why the same model should not be adopted by countries in North America, Latin Amer ica, Africa and Asia. </p> <p>However, even inside the EU such a move has problems, because only trade in goods is currently subject to majority voting. France, fearful of US cultural imperialism, is resisting giving up the veto, a move backed by campaigning groups who believe that handing more power to Brussels will hasten the globalisation process. </p> <p>Predictably, Lamy does not see it that way. He believes that Europe can only punch its weight if it speaks with one voice, the same message he sends out to eurosceptics in Britain. </p> <p>\"The UK's road to any visible and forceful integration process is always longer than other member states. This is for historic reasons: the convergence is there but it always takes longer for the UK.\" Why is that? \"Because of the politics of Europe and the UK. Because of British culture, history and public attitudes.\" </p> <p>Britain, he says, is a similar country to France. The difference is that France has a border with Germany. \"This has had a number of positive and negative consequences, and has made a difference to the way France has projected herself. The rewards have outbalanced the problems.\" </p> <p>In the end, he believes, Britain will come round. He says that it will make a difference once euro notes and coins start circulating, but that staying outside monetary union will eventually lead to a loss of jobs. \"The British are serious people who know what numbers are about.\" </p> <p>Whether this happens before or after the launch of a new trade round remains to be seen.

      "bodyText": "California, the state with perhaps the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world, is celebrating a huge drop in the number of lung cancer deaths and planning fresh measures to curb the use of tobacco. A new study shows that California's lung cancer rate fell by over 16% between 1988 and 1997, compared with a drop of 2.7% in the rest of the US. California recorded 72 cases per 100,000 in 1988 and 60 per 100,000 by 1997. The drop coincides with the state passing Proposition 99 in 1988, when it raised tobacco taxes by 25 cents (17 pence) a pack and spent 20% of the revenue on an aggressive educational programme, and steadily banning smoking in public places such as the workplace, bars and restaurants. Anti-smoking groups have leapt on the figures as proof of the effect of the state's controversial policies and want them repeated elsewhere. \"It is big news\", said Carolyn Martin for the American Lung Association of Sacramento. \"It shows [an aggressive educational policy] makes the difference between life and death.\" The number of smokers in California has fallen by 40% in the past decade, with those still smoking cutting their consumption by almost half. While 25% of adults smoke nationally, only 18% of Californians smoke. Only in Utah, with a large Mormon population for whom smoking is against their religion, is the rate of smoking lower. Few places in the world make smoking less acceptable. It is banned in bars, the workplace, on public transport and in some areas near a playground. Posters warning of the dangers of tobacco adorn the highways; one shows a \"Marlboro man\" with a drooping cigarette and the warning that smoking causes impotence. Now there are moves to make curbs on smoking even tougher. The Beverly Hills city council has just passed a measure banning smoking in its public parks. Violators will be given two warnings before the police take action. The West Hollywood city council has even drafted plans to stop people smoking in their flats if the neighbours complain about secondary smoking. Tenants who refuse to give up smoking could ultimately face eviction. Further north in Sacramento, fresh efforts are being made to stamp out the habit in bars, with compliance officers touring premises with sheriff's officers to enforce the law. A San Diego bar was briefly shut down for breaching the ban. California banned smoking in the workplace in 1994, and, more controversially, in bars in 1998. Some bars get round this by using makeshift tinfoil ashtrays which are hidden when enforcement officers arrive. Smoking is allowed outside bar areas such as patios, but this is under threat. The tobacco manufacturers have changed their tactics in the light of the laws. They now spend money on \"community projects\" which they then advertise on television.

In his writ, Mr Deniz alleges that detectives promised him a \u00a33,000 reward for every kilo of heroin seized. One raid alone is said to have resulted in a haul of 60 kilos of the drug. After a series of successful raids, police told Mr Deniz that they were concerned for his safety as a result of evidence he gave against members of the Turkish mafia.

Mr Deniz, who also closed his kebab shop in Darlington, Co Durham, claims he never received compensation for the loss of his businesses or the British passport he alleges he was promised. The writ describes how Mr Deniz contacted the ITV programme Crimestoppers in April 1996 saying he had information about drugs dealers operating in London. After a series of discussions with detectives, Mr Deniz supplied details of more than 25 criminals believed to be members of the Turkish mafia, and also provided details of a store of illegal weapons and ammunition he says were used in mafia-related murders.

      "body": "<p>Funny, our attitude to parties. Why do we feel obliged to cater for every conceivable taste? Wine, beer, spirits, soft drinks - you name it, we lay it on. Apart from making sure your veggie guests are happy, you don't do that with food - people get what they're given - so why do we do this with drinks?</p> <p>I put this to drinks masters Dick Bradsell (who created the cocktails for our fashion shoot on pages 86-94) and Jonathan Downey of Match, expecting them to endorse the idea of keeping drinks simple. Instead, they look shocked. \"I've had Americans come to my flat,\" says Downey, \"and tell me exactly how they want their drink served: 'Two shots, serve the ice separately,' that sort of thing. You can't tell people what to drink.\"</p> <p>\"Of course, you have to have water, too,\" says Bradsell, briskly. \"In fact, you have to have two different types of water. Some people hate fizzy.\"</p> <p>Bang goes my idea of a budget party, then. Still, if anyone knows what to give people to drink, this pair should. Bradsell, by common consent, is the most influential barman in London, the inventor of such legendary cocktails as the Vodka Espresso and the Wibble. Downey is the proprietor of the ultra-cool Match bars. Between them, they run a consultancy, Bar Solutions.</p> <p>So what do they serve at parties? Bradsell starts rattling off ideas: \"You need something with pow to get people going. Fizz is good to get them in a happy mood. Mix vodka, lemon juice and cassis, pour into glasses over ice and top with champagne or sparkling wine. Or add cheap fizz to a splash of sloe gin. That's seasonal. Or make bellinis with prosecco and peach pur\u00e9e. Then you can move on to something stronger.\"</p> <p>Such as? \"Almost any classic cocktail,\" says Bradsell. \"Old-fashioneds, Manhattans, Cosmopolitans. Choose drinks that are popular. I'd never serve Campari at a drinks party because so many people don't like it.\"</p> <p>\"You could also theme your drinks,\" suggests Downey. \"You could have a Polish evening, say, and give everyone a shot of vodka when they arrive. Or a New York-style party with Cosmopolitans and Manhattans. Or a Prohibition party with Long Island iced tea. Or a Cuban one with mojitos and daiquiris.\"</p> <p>\"I once filled a large display vase full of limes and mint, pummelled it all together, added vodka, ladled it into glasses and topped up with soda,\" reminisces Bradsell. \"If you can make things in bulk, it's a real help. Almost any tropical fruit juice works with rum. Or any dark spirit with ginger ale and a bit of fruit.\"</p> <p>The trick, though, is not to go overboard with the alcohol. \"People tend to go for mad things like vodka and Red Bull, or tequila slammers, but you want to avoid aggressive drinks. People can be aggressive enough as it is. As the evening wears on, you want to concentrate on single-shot drinks like a Pontberry Martini [one shot vodka, two shots cranberry juice, three tablespoons cr\u00e8me de mre]. A nice, balanced drink - not too strong. Or try this one that I've just created for Agent Provocateur: one shot of vodka, two of apple juice and two tablespoons of passionfruit syrup.\"</p> <p>But where do you get cr\u00e8me de mre and passionfruit syrup from? \"Good off-licences such as Gerry's in Old Compton Street, London [020-7734 4215], or the Class magazine barshop [0808 100 2691], which also has a good selection of glasses and other cocktail kit,\" says Bradsell.</p> <p>But doesn't all this get rather expensive? \"If you're short of cash, get everyone to bring a bottle, sure, but make sure they bring the same thing,\" says Downey. \"Ask them for a Stoli or Absolut vodka, a Tanqueray gin or a Havana Club rum.\"</p> <p>So, pukka brands, then, not a quick dash to Asda? \"God, yes,\" says Bradsell. \"You've got to use good ingredients. Like freshly squeezed juice.\"</p> <p>\"And ice,\" chips in Downey. \"You can never have enough ice. Twice as much as you think you'll need, and you still won't have enough.\"</p> <p>\"No ice, no party,\" adds Bradsell. \"Imagine gin and tonic without ice.\" I say I can't imagine gin and tonic in winter, anyway. \"Oh yeah? It's an all-season drink - there's always someone who's going to want that.\"</p> <p>It sounds like a lot of messing about, especially if you're not a dab hand at cocktails. \"Hire a barman,\" says Downey. \"It'll cost about \u00a310 an hour, but it's money well spent.\"</p> <p>\"The barman can't drink, either,\" adds Bradsell firmly. \"You can't mix drinks if you're drunk. We've got barmen you could hire, haven't we?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" says Downey. \"Just email Lucy at <a href=\"mailto:lucy@barsolutions.com\">lucy@barsolutions.com</a>.\"</p> <p>\"Even if you've got a mate who knows how to make drinks,\" says Bradsell, \"you would not believe how much pressure it takes off you. What you don't want is to let people make their own drinks - that's a disaster.\"</p> <p>As the evening wears on, they also advise you to reduce the alcohol in the drinks. \"By the end, you want to be getting as much liquid into people as possible,\" says Bradsell. \"And if they won't go home, make drinks without any alcohol in them at all.\"</p> <p>\"A Moscow Mule with water instead of vodka for anyone who can't say the word condescension,\" chips in Downey.</p> <p>Finally, what if it all goes pear-shaped and you have people throwing up all over the place? \"Here's an essential party tip on how to get the smell of sick out of your house,\" says Bradsell. \"Deodorised cat litter - it works really well.\"</p> <p>So now you know</p>",

      "bodyText": "Funny, our attitude to parties. Why do we feel obliged to cater for every conceivable taste? Wine, beer, spirits, soft drinks - you name it, we lay it on. Apart from making sure your veggie guests are happy, you don't do that with food - people get what they're given - so why do we do this with drinks? I put this to drinks masters Dick Bradsell (who created the cocktails for our fashion shoot on pages 86-94) and Jonathan Downey of Match, expecting them to endorse the idea of keeping drinks simple. Instead, they look shocked. \"I've had Americans come to my flat,\" says Downey, \"and tell me exactly how they want their drink served: 'Two shots, serve the ice separately,' that sort of thing. You can't tell people what to drink.\" \"Of course, you have to have water, too,\" says Bradsell, briskly. \"In fact, you have to have two different types of water. Some people hate fizzy.\" Bang goes my idea of a budget party, then. Still, if anyone knows what to give people to drink, this pair should. Bradsell, by common consent, is the most influential barman in London, the inventor of such legendary cocktails as the Vodka Espresso and the Wibble. Downey is the proprietor of the ultra-cool Match bars. Between them, they run a consultancy, Bar Solutions. So what do they serve at parties? Bradsell starts rattling off ideas: \"You need something with pow to get people going. Fizz is good to get them in a happy mood. Mix vodka, lemon juice and cassis, pour into glasses over ice and top with champagne or sparkling wine. Or add cheap fizz to a splash of sloe gin. That's seasonal. Or make bellinis with prosecco and peach pur\u00e9e. Then you can move on to something stronger.\" Such as? \"Almost any classic cocktail,\" says Bradsell. \"Old-fashioneds, Manhattans, Cosmopolitans. Choose drinks that are popular. I'd never serve Campari at a drinks party because so many people don't like it.\" \"You could also theme your drinks,\" suggests Downey. \"You could have a Polish evening, say, and give everyone a shot of vodka when they arrive. Or a New York-style party with Cosmopolitans and Manhattans. Or a Prohibition party with Long Island iced tea. Or a Cuban one with mojitos and daiquiris.\" \"I once filled a large display vase full of limes and mint, pummelled it all together, added vodka, ladled it into glasses and topped up with soda,\" reminisces Bradsell. \"If you can make things in bulk, it's a real help. Almost any tropical fruit juice works with rum. Or any dark spirit with ginger ale and a bit of fruit.\" The trick, though, is not to go overboard with the alcohol. \"People tend to go for mad things like vodka and Red Bull, or tequila slammers, but you want to avoid aggressive drinks. People can be aggressive enough as it is. As the evening wears on, you want to concentrate on single-shot drinks like a Pontberry Martini [one shot vodka, two shots cranberry juice, three tablespoons cr\u00e8me de mre]. A nice, balanced drink - not too strong. Or try this one that I've just created for Agent Provocateur: one shot of vodka, two of apple juice and two tablespoons of passionfruit syrup.\" But where do you get cr\u00e8me de mre and passionfruit syrup from? \"Good off-licences such as Gerry's in Old Compton Street, London [020-7734 4215], or the Class magazine barshop [0808 100 2691], which also has a good selection of glasses and other cocktail kit,\" says Bradsell. But doesn't all this get rather expensive? \"If you're short of cash, get everyone to bring a bottle, sure, but make sure they bring the same thing,\" says Downey. \"Ask them for a Stoli or Absolut vodka, a Tanqueray gin or a Havana Club rum.\" So, pukka brands, then, not a quick dash to Asda? \"God, yes,\" says Bradsell. \"You've got to use good ingredients. Like freshly squeezed juice.\" \"And ice,\" chips in Downey. \"You can never have enough ice. Twice as much as you think you'll need, and you still won't have enough.\" \"No ice, no party,\" adds Bradsell. \"Imagine gin and tonic without ice.\" I say I can't imagine gin and tonic in winter, anyway. \"Oh yeah? It's an all-season drink - there's always someone who's going to want that.\" It sounds like a lot of messing about, especially if you're not a dab hand at cocktails. \"Hire a barman,\" says Downey. \"It'll cost about \u00a310 an hour, but it's money well spent.\" \"The barman can't drink, either,\" adds Bradsell firmly. \"You can't mix drinks if you're drunk. We've got barmen you could hire, haven't we?\" \"Yeah,\" says Downey. \"Just email Lucy at lucy@barsolutions.com.\" \"Even if you've got a mate who knows how to make drinks,\" says Bradsell, \"you would not believe how much pressure it takes off you. What you don't want is to let people make their own drinks - that's a disaster.\" As the evening wears on, they also advise you to reduce the alcohol in the drinks. \"By the end, you want to be getting as much liquid into people as possible,\" says Bradsell. \"And if they won't go home, make drinks without any alcohol in them at all.\" \"A Moscow Mule with water instead of vodka for anyone who can't say the word condescension,\" chips in Downey. Finally, what if it all goes pear-shaped and you have people throwing up all over the place? \"Here's an essential party tip on how to get the smell of sick out of your house,\" says Bradsell. \"Deodorised cat litter - it works really well.\" So now you know",

      "trailText": "Great parties are all about getting just the right mix of people - and the same applies to the snacks you put on offer, says Bob Granleese.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'The thing about parties,\" says Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, \"is that most of us get into a terrible tizzy when it comes to the food - everyone wants to lay on a fantabulous spread of nibbles, but that means work, so we tend to fall back on boring old sausage rolls, crisps and nuts. It's much better to make just one or two really special dishes, to complement more standard fare.\"</p> <p>Rosie is unpacking her shopping bags in the kitchen of Christopher Woods and Michael Cormick, covering the work surface with the ingredients that she hopes will help make their party go with a real bang. Both work in the theatre - Christopher is a set designer (his most recent creation can be seen in The Mystery Of Charles Dickens at the Albery Theatre, London), while Michael is an actor with the Australian Musical Theatre - and rarely need an excuse to invite friends round to their home in Camden, north London.</p> <p>Even so, this time they've got one: the couple are off to spend the next few months in Australia, and are having a farewell party and a Thanksgiving celebration on successive nights. The only problem is, they are letting the house to a bunch of actors while they're away - \"We're theatrical landladies now,\" quips Christopher - and it's far from ready for its new tenants. They've already drafted in an American friend to cook the Thanksgiving meal, but the catering for the party has had to take second billing to DIY. Which is where the Kitchen Doctor comes in: they contacted Rosie with the simplest request (or, more accurately, bribe) she's ever received: \"If you sort out the food, you can come to our party.\" How could she resist?</p> <p>\"Admittedly, I did spend quite a lot,\" says Rosie as she finishes unpacking, \"but that's because I'm doing a whole range of finger food. If you didn't have me here, however, you'd probably only want to do two or three of them at most.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Christopher, who is going to help her out while Michael carries on with the painting and decorating, doesn't seem to mind at all. \"What do you want me to do?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Well, you could start by making the dough for the Spanish-style stuffed rolls,\" says Rosie.</p> <p>Following Rosie's instructions while she gets to work on the other dishes, Christopher is soon up to his elbows in flour, while Basil, his lurcher, ignores the enormous cowbone in his basket and gets under everyone's feet in his eagerness to snaffle every last bit of debris that falls off the work surfaces. \"He only eats human food,\" explains Christopher, \"and hardly even looks at that bone. Michael gets more use out of it, because he threatens me with it in the mornings, to get me out of bed - he's the spit of Bamm-Bamm in the Flintstones.\" Rosie chuckles, but then, realising there is still much to do, tells Christopher quickly to add a big glug of white wine to the dough mix. \"Does that speed up the process, or something?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" replied Rosie.</p> <p>\"I wonder, does it do the same for humans?\" says Christopher, then promptly drains what's left in the glass and licks his lips. \"What next?\"</p> <p>\"Peel the quails' eggs for the filling,\" says Rosie, who has already got the chicken soaking in its yoghurty marinade, and the beef cut and pounded thin as you like for the carpaccio. Christopher begins his task keenly enough, but, after 10 minutes have passed with only three eggs peeled, soon gets frustrated: \"You can buy these ready-peeled in jars, you know - I've seen them at Sainsbury's.\"</p> <p>The look on Rosie's face soon puts paid to this putative kitchen-hand rebellion, however, and Christopher resumes his toils, before mumbling, \"And I thought you said these were meant to be soft-boiled - they seem pretty well done to me.\"</p> <p>\"Bum,\" says Rosie. \"Then again, when you make a Scotch egg, it's hard-boiled, isn't it?\"</p> <p>\"So, these are like a Spanish Scotch egg, then?\" says Christopher.</p> <p>\"Well, no, not at all like that, really,\" replies Rosie, looking deflated again. \"Never mind, they'll have to do.\" And with that she returns to the chopping, pounding, stirring and all those other things a Kitchen Doctor does when she's doing her stuff. \"And now, for the lentil patties to go with the chicken tikka. Oh, and the savoury Eccles-type cakes or, as I prefer to call them, the new vol-au-vents - they're a bit like a new black for the nibbles set.\"</p> <p>\"Sounds impressive,\" says Christopher. \"What's in them?\"</p> <p>\"Goats' cheese, olives, herbs and all sorts of yummy stuff - Eccles cakes are quite crunchy, and I wanted to recreate that, only in a savoury way, so pinenuts are in there, too. Have you got any scales?\"</p> <p>\"Sorry.\"</p> <p>\"Oh dear - I am so bad at measuring things by eye,\" says Rosie. \"I always wildly overestimate.\" As if to prove her point, she opens a 500g packet of lentils and pours three-quarters of it into a pan. \"That's about 200g, isn't it?\"</p> <p>Christopher soon puts her right, and they set about finishing everything off. All of a sudden, a German pointer comes bounding into the room, swiftly followed by its owner, George, Christopher's best friend. \"This is Billie,\" she tells the KD crew, before adding hurriedly, \"as in Holiday, not Piper.\"</p> <p>While Basil and Billie join forces on a scrap hunt, Rosie lays an enticing array of nibbles on to serving plates, and then announces, rather grandly, \"Because you've done so well, I think it's time to test the cocktail I've devised for tonight - it's called the Amber Growler, because of its colour and bite.\"</p> <p>Christopher, who has already displayed a certain keenness for a drop or three, and George watch Rosie even more slavishly than their dogs had done while she fills two glasses with champagne, vodka, bitters and a sugar cube. As the cubes fizz away, they pounce. \"Bloody hell, that's strong,\" gasps Christopher. \"Should go down a treat.\"</p> <p>And so it did: the next day, when asked how the party had gone, Christopher couldn't really remember: \"We overdid it a bit,\" he said. \"Everyone had about six or seven of those cocktails, and we've just sent out for the Nurofen - Growlers should come with a health warning.\"</p> <p>All recipes serve eight.</p> <p><b>Carpaccio-wrapped rocket salad</b><br> A mixture of a couple of recipes that I learned from my main culinary influence, Juliet Peston <br></p> <p><b> 500g good quality beef fillet </b></p> <p><b>1 generous splash good olive oil </b></p> <p><b>Black pepper </b></p> <p><b>150g rocket leaves </b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp truffle oil (expensive, I know, but you use it only sparingly) </b></p> <p><b>30g Parmesan</b></p> <p>Slice the fillet into 1.5cm thick slices (to make cutting easier, refrigerate the meat for an hour or two, to firm it up). Toss the slices of beef in olive oil and black pepper, and leave to marinade until 10 minutes before serving.</p> <p>When you're ready to plate up, place each piece of meat between two pieces of clingfilm and flatten with a rolling pin until very thin. To serve, season the rocket, shave over the Parmesan and mix in the truffle oil. Take a piece of beef, season with a little salt, lay some rocket salad on top, then roll up and arrange on a plate, perhaps with a little more Parmesan shaved over the top.</p> <p><b> Pancetta-Wrapped Tiger Prawns</b><br> These can be prepared in advance, and take only a minute or two to cook, so are ideal if time is short. For an alternative, use green beans instead of prawns. <br></p> <p><b> 500g tiger prawns, peeled, heads and tails on </b></p> <p><b>Black pepper </b></p> <p><b>225g pancetta </b></p> <p><b>8 sage leaves, cut into strips </b></p> <p><b>Lemon juice</b></p> <p>Season each prawn with pepper, lemon juice and a few strands of sage, then leave to marinade for about half an hour. Wrap a strip of pancetta around each prawn until it is completely covered. To cook, lay in a very hot griddle or frying pan for a minute or so, turning once.</p> <p><b> Lentil rounds with chicken tikka, yoghurt and mint</b> <br> The lentil cakes are based on a recipe by Lorna Wing. She uses split red lentils, but I prefer the earthiness of puy lentils. Served with spicy chicken, yoghurt and mint makes for a pretty hearty mini-snack. <br></p> <p>For the lentil cakes</p> <p><b> 225g lentils </b></p> <p><b>1 chilli, deseeded and finely chopped </b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed </b></p> <p><b>5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated </b></p> <p><b>2 heaped tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander </b></p> <p><b>tsp turmeric </b></p> <p><b>1 dssp passata </b></p> <p><b>1 egg </b></p> <p><b>tsp salt </b></p> <p><b>Oil, for frying (I favour grapeseed)</b></p> <p>Rinse the lentils in cold water, pick out any stones, pop them in a bowl, stir in the passata and pour in enough water to cover. Leave to soak for eight hours.</p> <p>Drain the lentils, tip them into a food processor, along with the remaining ingredients, and blend to a smoothish paste. Divide the mixture into even-sized balls, then flatten into patties. Leave to rest for about half an hour. Shallow fry in hot oil over a moderate heat for about four minutes on either side until crisp and golden. Allow to cool slightly, then top with the following:</p> <p>For the chicken</p> <p><b> 2 chicken breasts, skinless and boneless, cut into 3cm pieces </b></p> <p><b>150ml pot natural yoghurt </b></p> <p><b>1 tsp ground cumin </b></p> <p><b>1 tsp ground coriander </b></p> <p><b>tsp cinnamon </b></p> <p><b>tsp paprika </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp chopped mint </b></p> <p><b>Salt </b></p> <p><b>8cm cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely chopped</b></p> <p>Mix all the herbs and spices into 100ml of the yoghurt, reserving half a tablespoon of mint for later. Pour the mixture over the chicken, and leave to marinade for as long as the lentils, or as long as possible. Meanwhile, mix the other 50ml of yoghurt with the rest of the mint, the cucumber and a pinch of salt.</p> <p>To cook, throw the chicken into a very hot pan, turn down the heat to medium and stir until just cooked through. Serve on top of the lentil rounds with a teaspoon of yoghurt.</p> <p><b> The new Vol-Au-Vent </b>This is a sort of savoury Eccles cake, which I thought could be this season's vol-au-vent on the party circuit. Another fantastic filling would be leek and mushroom - it's one of those things that has endless possibilities. <br></p> <p><b> 450g shop-bought puff pastry </b></p> <p><b>2 shallots, finely chopped </b></p> <p><b>50g green olives, roughly chopped (I used ones that were stuffed with pimento and</b> <b>anchovy - it's all down to personal choice)</b></p> <p><b>50g black olives, pitted and roughly chopped </b></p> <p><b>200g crumbly goats' cheese, rind removed and cheese broken up </b></p> <p><b>55g pinenuts, roughly chopped </b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped </b></p> <p><b>1 dssp basil, chopped </b></p> <p><b>Black pepper </b></p> <p><b>1 egg yolk</b></p> <p>For the topping</p> <p><b> 1 egg white </b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp sesame seeds </b></p> <p><b>1 tsp coarse sea salt</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Roll out the puff pastry into a large rectangle about the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Leave it to rest while you separate the egg, and mix together the sesame seeds and salt for the topping.</p> <p>Mix together the remaining ingredients. Cut circles from the pastry about 6cm in diameter, saving any trimmings for the chocolate whirligig recipe (see below). Divide the pastry rounds into two, and place a good teaspoonful of the mixture in the centre of one batch.</p> <p>Brush the edges with egg yolk then place the other batch of pastry rounds on top. Roll the parcels a little, so the filling just shows through, and cut a couple of slashes on the lids.

      "bodyText": "'The thing about parties,\" says Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, \"is that most of us get into a terrible tizzy when it comes to the food - everyone wants to lay on a fantabulous spread of nibbles, but that means work, so we tend to fall back on boring old sausage rolls, crisps and nuts. It's much better to make just one or two really special dishes, to complement more standard fare.\" Rosie is unpacking her shopping bags in the kitchen of Christopher Woods and Michael Cormick, covering the work surface with the ingredients that she hopes will help make their party go with a real bang. Both work in the theatre - Christopher is a set designer (his most recent creation can be seen in The Mystery Of Charles Dickens at the Albery Theatre, London), while Michael is an actor with the Australian Musical Theatre - and rarely need an excuse to invite friends round to their home in Camden, north London. Even so, this time they've got one: the couple are off to spend the next few months in Australia, and are having a farewell party and a Thanksgiving celebration on successive nights. The only problem is, they are letting the house to a bunch of actors while they're away - \"We're theatrical landladies now,\" quips Christopher - and it's far from ready for its new tenants. They've already drafted in an American friend to cook the Thanksgiving meal, but the catering for the party has had to take second billing to DIY. Which is where the Kitchen Doctor comes in: they contacted Rosie with the simplest request (or, more accurately, bribe) she's ever received: \"If you sort out the food, you can come to our party.\" How could she resist? \"Admittedly, I did spend quite a lot,\" says Rosie as she finishes unpacking, \"but that's because I'm doing a whole range of finger food. If you didn't have me here, however, you'd probably only want to do two or three of them at most.\" Unsurprisingly, Christopher, who is going to help her out while Michael carries on with the painting and decorating, doesn't seem to mind at all. \"What do you want me to do?\" he asks. \"Well, you could start by making the dough for the Spanish-style stuffed rolls,\" says Rosie. Following Rosie's instructions while she gets to work on the other dishes, Christopher is soon up to his elbows in flour, while Basil, his lurcher, ignores the enormous cowbone in his basket and gets under everyone's feet in his eagerness to snaffle every last bit of debris that falls off the work surfaces. \"He only eats human food,\" explains Christopher, \"and hardly even looks at that bone. Michael gets more use out of it, because he threatens me with it in the mornings, to get me out of bed - he's the spit of Bamm-Bamm in the Flintstones.\" Rosie chuckles, but then, realising there is still much to do, tells Christopher quickly to add a big glug of white wine to the dough mix. \"Does that speed up the process, or something?\" he asks. \"Exactly,\" replied Rosie. \"I wonder, does it do the same for humans?\" says Christopher, then promptly drains what's left in the glass and licks his lips. \"What next?\" \"Peel the quails' eggs for the filling,\" says Rosie, who has already got the chicken soaking in its yoghurty marinade, and the beef cut and pounded thin as you like for the carpaccio. Christopher begins his task keenly enough, but, after 10 minutes have passed with only three eggs peeled, soon gets frustrated: \"You can buy these ready-peeled in jars, you know - I've seen them at Sainsbury's.\" The look on Rosie's face soon puts paid to this putative kitchen-hand rebellion, however, and Christopher resumes his toils, before mumbling, \"And I thought you said these were meant to be soft-boiled - they seem pretty well done to me.\" \"Bum,\" says Rosie. \"Then again, when you make a Scotch egg, it's hard-boiled, isn't it?\" \"So, these are like a Spanish Scotch egg, then?\" says Christopher. \"Well, no, not at all like that, really,\" replies Rosie, looking deflated again. \"Never mind, they'll have to do.\" And with that she returns to the chopping, pounding, stirring and all those other things a Kitchen Doctor does when she's doing her stuff. \"And now, for the lentil patties to go with the chicken tikka. Oh, and the savoury Eccles-type cakes or, as I prefer to call them, the new vol-au-vents - they're a bit like a new black for the nibbles set.\" \"Sounds impressive,\" says Christopher. \"What's in them?\" \"Goats' cheese, olives, herbs and all sorts of yummy stuff - Eccles cakes are quite crunchy, and I wanted to recreate that, only in a savoury way, so pinenuts are in there, too. Have you got any scales?\" \"Sorry.\" \"Oh dear - I am so bad at measuring things by eye,\" says Rosie. \"I always wildly overestimate.\" As if to prove her point, she opens a 500g packet of lentils and pours three-quarters of it into a pan. \"That's about 200g, isn't it?\" Christopher soon puts her right, and they set about finishing everything off. All of a sudden, a German pointer comes bounding into the room, swiftly followed by its owner, George, Christopher's best friend. \"This is Billie,\" she tells the KD crew, before adding hurriedly, \"as in Holiday, not Piper.\" While Basil and Billie join forces on a scrap hunt, Rosie lays an enticing array of nibbles on to serving plates, and then announces, rather grandly, \"Because you've done so well, I think it's time to test the cocktail I've devised for tonight - it's called the Amber Growler, because of its colour and bite.\" Christopher, who has already displayed a certain keenness for a drop or three, and George watch Rosie even more slavishly than their dogs had done while she fills two glasses with champagne, vodka, bitters and a sugar cube. As the cubes fizz away, they pounce. \"Bloody hell, that's strong,\" gasps Christopher. \"Should go down a treat.\" And so it did: the next day, when asked how the party had gone, Christopher couldn't really remember: \"We overdid it a bit,\" he said. \"Everyone had about six or seven of those cocktails, and we've just sent out for the Nurofen - Growlers should come with a health warning.\" All recipes serve eight. Carpaccio-wrapped rocket salad A mixture of a couple of recipes that I learned from my main culinary influence, Juliet Peston 500g good quality beef fillet 1 generous splash good olive oil Black pepper 150g rocket leaves 1 tbsp truffle oil (expensive, I know, but you use it only sparingly) 30g Parmesan Slice the fillet into 1.5cm thick slices (to make cutting easier, refrigerate the meat for an hour or two, to firm it up). Toss the slices of beef in olive oil and black pepper, and leave to marinade until 10 minutes before serving. When you're ready to plate up, place each piece of meat between two pieces of clingfilm and flatten with a rolling pin until very thin. To serve, season the rocket, shave over the Parmesan and mix in the truffle oil. Take a piece of beef, season with a little salt, lay some rocket salad on top, then roll up and arrange on a plate, perhaps with a little more Parmesan shaved over the top. Pancetta-Wrapped Tiger Prawns These can be prepared in advance, and take only a minute or two to cook, so are ideal if time is short. For an alternative, use green beans instead of prawns. 500g tiger prawns, peeled, heads and tails on Black pepper 225g pancetta 8 sage leaves, cut into strips Lemon juice Season each prawn with pepper, lemon juice and a few strands of sage, then leave to marinade for about half an hour. Wrap a strip of pancetta around each prawn until it is completely covered. To cook, lay in a very hot griddle or frying pan for a minute or so, turning once. Lentil rounds with chicken tikka, yoghurt and mint The lentil cakes are based on a recipe by Lorna Wing. She uses split red lentils, but I prefer the earthiness of puy lentils. Served with spicy chicken, yoghurt and mint makes for a pretty hearty mini-snack. For the lentil cakes 225g lentils 1 chilli, deseeded and finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 2 heaped tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander tsp turmeric 1 dssp passata 1 egg tsp salt Oil, for frying (I favour grapeseed) Rinse the lentils in cold water, pick out any stones, pop them in a bowl, stir in the passata and pour in enough water to cover. Leave to soak for eight hours. Drain the lentils, tip them into a food processor, along with the remaining ingredients, and blend to a smoothish paste. Divide the mixture into even-sized balls, then flatten into patties. Leave to rest for about half an hour. Shallow fry in hot oil over a moderate heat for about four minutes on either side until crisp and golden. Allow to cool slightly, then top with the following: For the chicken 2 chicken breasts, skinless and boneless, cut into 3cm pieces 150ml pot natural yoghurt 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander tsp cinnamon tsp paprika 2 tbsp chopped mint Salt 8cm cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely chopped Mix all the herbs and spices into 100ml of the yoghurt, reserving half a tablespoon of mint for later. Pour the mixture over the chicken, and leave to marinade for as long as the lentils, or as long as possible. Meanwhile, mix the other 50ml of yoghurt with the rest of the mint, the cucumber and a pinch of salt. To cook, throw the chicken into a very hot pan, turn down the heat to medium and stir until just cooked through. Serve on top of the lentil rounds with a teaspoon of yoghurt. The new Vol-Au-Vent This is a sort of savoury Eccles cake, which I thought could be this season's vol-au-vent on the party circuit. Another fantastic filling would be leek and mushroom - it's one of those things that has endless possibilities. 450g shop-bought puff pastry 2 shallots, finely chopped 50g green olives, roughly chopped (I used ones that were stuffed with pimento and anchovy - it's all down to personal choice) 50g black olives, pitted and roughly chopped 200g crumbly goats' cheese, rind removed and cheese broken up 55g pinenuts, roughly chopped 1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped 1 dssp basil, chopped Black pepper 1 egg yolk For the topping 1 egg white 1 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tsp coarse sea salt Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Roll out the puff pastry into a large rectangle about the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Leave it to rest while you separate the egg, and mix together the sesame seeds and salt for the topping. Mix together the remaining ingredients. Cut circles from the pastry about 6cm in diameter, saving any trimmings for the chocolate whirligig recipe (see below). Divide the pastry rounds into two, and place a good teaspoonful of the mixture in the centre of one batch. Brush the edges with egg yolk then place the other batch of pastry rounds on top. Roll the parcels a little, so the filling just shows through, and cut a couple of slashes on the lids. Brush with egg white, and sprinkle with the seed-and-salt mix. To cook, place on a tray and bake until golden. Serve warm. Grilled chicory with tomatoes and parmesan Easy, delicious and a refreshing change from rich things. Use asparagus tips instead of beans when in season. 4 heads chicory 55g cherry tomatoes 30g Parmesan, coarsely grated 55g French beans (or asparagus tips - both optional, depending on the size of the chicory leaves) 1 tbsp olive oil 1 dssp balsamic vinegar Salt and pepper If using, blanch the beans in boiling, salted water. Cut off the base of the chicory and separate each head into individual leaves, discarding any blemished ones on the outside. Place the picked leaves on a grill tray, all facing upwards, like little boats. Cut the tomatoes in half and season. Fill the chicory boats with the tomatoes and the beans (if using). Drizzle with oil and vinegar, then scatter over the Parmesan. Preheat the grill, and cook until the chicory begins to soften slightly and browns at the edges. Serve at once. Spanish-style stuffed bread This is a miniature version of hornaza de Salamanca, from Spain, a loaf filled with a long piece of chorizo and whole soft-boiled eggs before baking. For the dough 500g strong white flour 15g fresh yeast (or double the amount of dried) 10g salt A good slug olive oil 1 tbsp white wine (if you have some knocking around - it helps the dough to prove quicker) 300-350ml warm water For the filling 24 quail eggs 24 slices spicy chorizo 1 jar artichoke hearts in olive oil Salt and pepper First, make the dough. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, add the yeast and rub it through the mixture. Make a well in the centre, and pour in the wine, oil and about two-thirds of the water. Mix until it forms a dough, adding more water if necessary, then tip on to a floured surface and knead for five minutes or so, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth or oiled clingfilm, and leave to prove in a warm place until doubled in size. In the meantime, soft boil the quail eggs - that is, bring them to the boil, let them bubble for no more than 30 seconds, then run them under the cold tap. When they are cold enough to handle, peel very carefully. Drain the artichokes, and chop roughly. When the dough has doubled in size, turn it out on to a floured surface and knock it back (ie, punch it about a bit). Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

Place on a floured tray, join-side down, cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to prove. They are ready to cook when the dough springs back when you touch it. Glaze with a little milk and bake until golden (around 15 minutes). Chocolate Whirligigs The puff pastry trimmings from the vol-au-vents above 30g unsalted butter 55g mascarpone 2 tbsp good cocoa powder 2 tbsp honey 1 tsp cinnamon 55g hazelnuts, roughly chopped Combine all the pastry trimmings, roll out into a thin rectangle about 0.5cm deep, and leave to rest. Melt the butter, pour over the mascarpone, beat in the cocoa, honey, cinnamon and nuts, and work the whole lot into a smooth paste.

      "body": "<p>What strikes people most when they first see the Weeping Madonna of Civitavecchia is her size. The white glazed plaster statue is only 16 inches high, her face, with its downcast eyes, no bigger than a man's thumb. Originally bought from a souvenir stall at the shrine of Our Lady at Medjugorje in Bosnia, she cost less than a fiver, but, as mass-produced religious statuettes go, is surprisingly untrashy.</p> <p>For the past five years, La Madonnina, the little madonna, as she is known locally, has stood behind bulletproof glass in the little church of St Agostino in Pantano, a poor agricultural suburb of the port of Civitavecchia, near Rome. Every year, she attracts thousands of pilgrims. Of the scores of \"miracles\" reported in Italy during the lead-up to the millennium, only this \"weeping Madonna\", who even has her own website, continues to bring in the charabancs, transforming a once unknown chapel off a dirt-track into an international religious shrine.</p> <p>However, anyone hoping to see her weep, or detect traces of blood on her cheeks, will be disappointed. Since allegedly weeping tears of blood in front of thousands of witnesses in February 1995, La Madonnina has remained dry-eyed and all traces of blood have long since faded. Which is more than can be said for the controversy that surrounds her.</p> <p>La Madonnina's worldwide renown is due as much to her supposed mystical powers as to the fact that, for the past five years, she has been the subject of an unprecedented and bizarre criminal investigation in which the Italian authorities have become embroiled in a so-called \"pious fraud\", a charge normally ignored, or dealt with by the church. In this case, the Procura, or district attorney, is determined to expose La Madonnina's tears as a hoax and identify the culprits as the statue's owner, Fabio Gregori, and his family.</p> <p>The enquiry appears set to run indefinitely and has all the makings of an absurdist melodrama, involving the diverging interests of anti-cult campaigners, judicial authorities, the Catholic church, and the mayor of Civitavecchia, Pietro Tidei, a communist nonbeliever who is determined that the shrine at Pantano should become as commercially viable as Lourdes, Fatima or Medjugorje. Meanwhile, like many thousands of believers, Gregori, a 37-year-old electrician from Pantano, believes that what he witnessed five years ago was a miracle. What he also knows is that it has changed his life, largely for the worse.</p> <p>It began, like most mystical experiences, in the most humdrum circumstances. As a devout Catholic, Gregori was overjoyed when his local priest, Father Don Pablo Martin, returned from a visit to Medjugorje in September 1994 and gave him a plaster statuette of the Virgin to protect his home and family. With nothing to distinguish it from the serried ranks of Madonnas around the Bosnian pilgrimage site, Father Pablo nevertheless believed that this one had special powers, claiming he was guided by one of Italy's most celebrated religious figures, the late Capuchin friar Padre Pio, to bring the statue back to Civitavecchia, where \"the most beautiful event of this life\" would occur.</p> <p>Five months on, an event did indeed occur that propelled the tiny hamlet into the spotlight. On the afternoon of Thursday, February 2, 1995, Gregori was hurrying to mass when his six-year-old daughter Jessica's shrieks pierced the air. \"Papa, Papa, come and look. The Madonnina is crying. There's blood everywhere!\" Rushing to join her at the little stone shrine he had built in the garden, he saw, he says, red liquid well up in the statuette's eyes and trickle down her cheeks and gown.</p> <p>Deeply shaken, he drove to mass, where he recounted the incident to Father Pablo. Within hours, news of the \"weeping\" had spread throughout the district and crowds of acquaintances and strangers began gathering outside his gate. The circus had begun.</p> <p>Throughout the weekend, as the story hit the headlines, the faithful and the merely curious, including reporters and TV crews, thronged in their thousands down the small country lane to Gregori's house, pushing into his small garden, praying, weeping, gawping, chattering and crossing themselves as they filed past the tiny statue before shuffling out again to gossip and speak to the press.</p> <p>\"It was a mass invasion, they were swinging from the trees,\" recalls Scottish-born Carmela Dinardo, who runs Civitavecchia's foreign language school. \"You couldn't move for cars, buses and people blocking the way to his home. I wanted to see the Madonna, too, and drove down there, but was forced to park far away and walk. It took hours to reach the shrine. They were battering down his gate, hundreds of people at a time trampling around his garden. People had come from all over Italy. The Gregoris simply locked themselves inside the house.\" After several people had tried to handle the statue and touch the blood, police were called to maintain order at the site.</p> <p>By late Sunday, February 5, the statuette had, according to many witnesses, wept blood 13 times. By the following day, Gregori could take the strain no longer and, pursued by paparazzi, delivered the statuette to Father Pablo at St Agostino for safekeeping. Then he locked the gates to his garden and put up a notice: \"Please don't stop here. The Madonna is no longer here.\"</p> <p>And there the drama should have ended. It was, after all, just the latest in a long line of incidents involving holy effigies, animated statues and sightings of the Virgin Mary during the 90s throughout the world. In India and England, reports that animal statues at various Hindu temples had begun \"drinking\" milk also drew crowds for several months. <br><br> Even in Italy, with nine separate lacrimazioni (weepings) reported in the first two months of 1995 alone, belief had begun to give way to scepticism as each incident was either dismissed due to unreliable eyewitness reports or found to be a practical joke or some natural phenomenon, such as dewdrops forming on a statue.</p> <p>Why should La Madonnina of Civitavecchia be any different? And what makes locals, such as Dinardo, an ardent believer in miracles, and her friend, Christiana Vallarino, a local reporter from Il Messaggero, who saw the tears but insists it's a clever trick, still argue over the incident in the cafes on Civitavecchia's seafront? The answer lies in the web of intrigue that still surrounds the case, and speculation over one of the most colourful characters involved in it, Monsignor Girolamo Grillo, the bishop of Civitavecchia.</p> <p>As he welcomes me to his house to tell me about the story, Monsignor Grillo, a jocular 70-year-old known locally as \"il grillo parlante\" (the talking cricket) because of his outspokenness, still chuckles over his initial reaction. After taking the statuette from Gregori, Father Pablo delivered a report to Grillo, describing what had occurred in the family's garden that weekend. <br><br>Phoning him several hours later to ask him what to do with the statue, Father Pablo was shocked at the bishop's response: \"I tore up the report and threw it in the bin and told Don Pablo to destroy the statue immediately, so as to end all this trouble! I had no doubt it was a hoax. Naturally, I started hearing from angry parishioners condemning me for not believing in all this rubbish.\"</p> <p>There were well-founded reasons for Monsignor Grillo's wish to distance himself from \"this rubbish\". According to rumour, the area around Civitavecchia is heaving with Jehovah's Witnesses, occult groups and Satanists, any of whom could have planned a hoax. More significantly, the Vatican, sensitive to charges of superstition, favours a cautious attitude towards reported \"miracles\", especially those involving inanimate objects, rather than mystic \"seers\" as in Fatima. <br><br>His next step, which was to phone the police and ask them to investigate the Gregori family, therefore, seems logical, as does his request to his own doctor to carry out tests on the \"blood\" now congealed on the statue. What he wasn't prepared for was the result: the substance was haemoglobin.</p> <p>That report, says Monsignor Grillo, only strengthened his resolve to expose the trick. \"The Gregoris, I found out, were simple, poor, hard-working, local people, honest and devoutly religious, with no criminal record. I even did an exorcism on them, believing it was a satanic set up.\"</p> <p>But, being something of an amateur sleuth, Bishop Grillo wouldn't let the matter rest. Father Pablo, disobeying instructions, had given the statue to one of Gregori's brothers, so Monsignor Grillo persuaded the family to let him take it to Rome for analysis of the bloodstains and x-rays of the structure. The tests were repeated several times by separate teams, one headed by Professor Angelo Fiori at the Vatican's Gemelli hospital, the other by Rome's leading forensic medical examiner and DNA expert, Giancarlo Umani-Ronchi, director of the Institute for Forensic Medicine at the University of Rome.</p> <p>\"When I handed the statue in at the lab, they assured me it would turn out to be animal blood,\" laughs Monsignor Grillo, drawing out the story for effect. \"Then they found it was human blood.\" But greater revelations were to come: repeated analysis and DNA tests established that it was male blood, while a series of x-rays and CAT scans of the statue itself confirmed that it was solid, with no sign of having been rigged. \"That actually increased my doubts. Obviously it was a hoax. The blood of Our Lady ought to have been female, no?\"</p> <p>After reporting these developments to the Vatican, Monsignor Grillo was authorised to set up a theological commission to study the case. It was the start of many sleepless nights, he says. On March 1, soon after the statue had been returned to him, CODACONS, Italy's largest consumer protection group, alarmed at extensive media coverage of the case, issued a formal complaint against \"unknown persons\". The charge was \"abuso della credulita popolare\" (abuse of the people's belief), under a law introduced in 1930 to deter magicians and hoaxers from duping the public.</p> <p>This was followed by an allegation of fraud from a prominent Italian helpline, Telefono Antiplagio, run by Professor Giovanni Panunzio, a children's religion teacher in Sardinia and director of the Italian Committee to Help Victims of Charlatans and Gurus.</p> <p>Again, Monsignor Grillo admits giving police the go-ahead to investigate. \"I called in the law, hoping they would finally help me prove the weeping was a joke, because I was so sure it was.\" But when police raided the homes of all four Gregori brothers and their mother at dawn on March 8, turning everything up-side down in the search for evidence of trickery, they drew a blank.</p> <p>Fabio Gregori's ordeal, however, was far from over. Under Italian law, once an accusation is made, the public prosecutor is obliged to open a full-scale criminal investigation, which can drag on for years, even if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute. What happened a week later added a whole new dimension to an already farcical situation. While saying mass at home with his sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two Romanian nuns, the bishop claims that La Madonnina cried tears of blood as he held her in his hands.</p> <p>Although he announced what he had witnessed in a TV interview a week later, in effect endorsing the miracle, he refuses to use the word miracle: \"It's a mystery - there is no rational explanation,\" he tells me, with the first sign of gravitas that afternoon.</p> <p>The bishop's announcement - carried out against the advice of the Vatican - merely cranked up Antonio Abano, the public prosecutor, who enlisted Criminal-pol, the Italian equivalent of the FBI, to dig further into the case. Abano ordered the bishop to hand over La Madonnina and requested all male members of the Gregori family to submit blood samples for DNA testing against that on the statute. Neither request was met.</p> <p>\"Since I had witnessed the weeping myself, the Vatican gave me authority to tell the police to stay away from the case and not permit the statue to be confiscated,\" says Monsignor Grillo. \"That didn't go down so well. Now the prosecutor was convinced that Gregori and I were in this together. They accused me of being in cahoots with the Vatican and both of us of fraud. At this stage, they would have liked to put me in jail for being the hoaxer, but a bishop is still a bishop, so they tried to seize the Madonnina. The law always puts its foot in it when getting involved in religious matters. In Lourdes, Fatima, now here, they've made a hash of things.\"</p> <p>The upshot, Fabio Gregori's lawyer, Bruno Forestieri, says drily, was \"a very Italian-style compromise\". The courts agreed to let the bishop keep the statue in a sealed cupboard in his residence while the enquiry continued. \"It was a diplomatic solution: the state prosecutor intervened, but without violating the church's autonomy,\" explains Forestieri, who, at Gregori's request, appealed to the Court of Cassation in Rome for the statue's release in time for Easter. Hundreds of irate local parishioners had been publicly protesting at the state's interference with their plans to carry the statue \"home\" to St Agostino church in the town's traditional Good Friday procession, which more than 10,000 worshippers were expected to attend. Two weeks later, an order was issued for its release. \"Which makes me the only lawyer in history to set the Virgin Mary free,\" says Forestieri.</p> <p>However, the order came too late for the Easter procession - which may have been a blessing of sorts. For instead, in a gesture that spoke volumes, the Pope's close friend and fellow countryman, Cardinal Andrej Maria Deskur, after giving an address at the cathedral of Civitavecchia on Easter Monday, presented a blessed copy of La Madonnina to the Gregori family. Implying that the Pope shared his views, Cardinal Deskur went on to compare the tribulations of Gregori's original statuette to that of the revered Madonna of Czestochowa in Poland, sequestered by the communist authorities in 1967 and now standing in the Pope's diocese of Krakow.</p> <p>Although, thus far, the Vatican had remained silent, the subtext of Cardinal Deskur's speech hardly needed spelling out. La Madonnina was finally returned to the parish church in June, after undergoing further x-rays and scans together with DNA analysis of the new bloodstains, which were reportedly identical to the first. This finally led Monsignor Grillo to state publicly that because they were of male blood, the tears could only be those of Christ.</p> <p>Since then, the shrine of La Madonnina has become a magnet for tourists. To cope with the influx, Mayor Tidei has allocated billions of lire for the construction of roads, street lighting, drainage and toilets, parking facilities, a pilgrim's hostel and a large consecrated marquee to meet the demand for extra services, vigils and communions.</p> <p>Despite this, Tidei grumbles that St Agostino has not yet made the big time. The planned construction of a large new sanctuary is awaiting the church's go-ahead. \"The bishop won't give me the opportunity to promote it as a commercial venture. He 'created' the miracle, but he is doing DIY tourism when we should tie in with the big pilgrim tour operators, for instance to go from Rome to Lourdes via Pantano.\"</p> <p>The mayor is not the only one to exploit the commercial potential of the statue. Recently, Forestieri took out an injunction against Hypo, an Austrian bank that used a picture of La Madonnina in an advertisement, and was planning proceedings against Benetton until the Italian manufacturer dropped its own ad featuring the statue.</p> <p>In additional insult to Gregori, the replacement statue was stolen from his garden by a visiting priest who, when stopped by police on the motorway, argued that he thought it was a gift. The entire saga, says Forestieri, has had a \"tragic impact on Gregori's life, making him mistrustful and withdrawn\".</p> <p>His refusal to submit to a DNA test is still regarded by many as suspicious, but Forestieri remains dubious about standards of the original forensic analysis, in which only five strands of DNA were identified from blood on the statue, instead of the dozen or more required for accurate matching. What especially grieves Gregori - who declined Forestieri's request to speak to me - is that a profoundly mystical event has become not only a money-grabbing enterprise, but is also fodder for pop science TV shows.</p> <p>One can see his point. In February this year, after a service celebrating the fifth anniversary of the original \"weeping\", Alfredo Barrago, a popular magician, shone a red laserbeam on to the statue from a gallery in the church as part of a TV demonstration on how to conjure tears of blood. Evidently, the effect was so realistic that a woman praying in front of the shrine fainted.</p> <p>In recent years, such expos\u00e9s of the paranormal have become increasingly popular. Among the more bizarre explanations for La Madonnina's tears is the suggestion that someone fitted the statue with special contact lenses, which expand and release liquid when exposed to heat, or that a blood-filled syringe fitted inside the figurine was attached to a hidden battery, allowing the device to be electronically activated by remote control. The suggestion that Gregori may have resorted to such tricks has, says Forestieri, reduced his client to an emotional wreck.</p> <p>However, many, including devout Catholics, favour any debate, no matter how dressed up as showbusiness, believing that a sinister conspiracy to undermine the church lies behind events in Civitavecchia. Panunzio of the anti-charlatan hotline, who has conducted his own research into phoney miracles, is convinced that Gregori was set up.</p> <p>\"Almost certainly he and Bishop Grillo were cheated by unscrupulous people who want to increase superstition and decrease faith. Exploitation of holy icons is widespread among occultists.\" Recently, Panunzio's organisation has examined about 10 \"weeping\" icons and similar phenomena throughout Italy, and dismissed them all as \"illusions or jokes\".</p> <p>In the case of Civitavecchia, he claims to have received several tip-offs: \"In December 1994, a man, who introduced himself as an expert in 'esotericism', called me and warned me about a 'weeping' that was being planned in Civitavecchia. Don't you think that's a very strange coincidence?\" After the incident, he received an anonymous fax from someone claiming repentance for being behind events at Pantano, and admitted that it had begun as a carnival prank, but that \"fanatical colleagues\" had taken it further.</p> <p>Although Panunzio counts himself among a growing category of special investigators of pious frauds, being a non-scientist who often relies on the magician Barrago's expertise in identifying possible trickery, he comes across more as an enthusiastic dabbler. What really disqualifies him from being a rigorous, impartial investigator is that he has his own agenda: to strengthen true religious faith and stamp out rampant occultism and New Age beliefs, which he likens to pornography.</p> <p>With Satan apparently lurking around every corner, these forces of darkness, he says, are especially widespread in Italy (in fact, the highest number of religious \"miracles\" are reported in Ireland, the United States and Italy).</p> <p>Even if the truth behind La Madonnina is never revealed, the case, by setting a precedent for police involvement in church affairs, raises important questions over the whole issue of \"pious fraud\" and the rigour with which such apparent misdemeanours are investigated. In their persistent hounding of Fabio Gregori when so many other people might have played a part in the incident, the authorities in Civitavecchia have displayed an astonishing lack of common sense. Why else enlist the help of illusionists whose prime instinct is to entertain? Theories, such as those propounded by Barrago, seem to have convinced prosecutors that the \"weeping\" was the result of some absurdly elaborate mechanism, when in fact there is likely to be a far simpler, if mundane explanation. One problem is the dubious presumption that religious hoaxes aren't \"real\" crimes, since only the gullible believe in miracles and thus \"have it coming\", which prevents most prosecutors and detectives from taking these incidents seriously in the first place. And among those who do, how many are sufficiently familiar with the \"backstage\" workings of the church to know what to look for in such investigations?</p> <p>Obviously very few. Which is why, as happened initially in Civitavecchia - until Monsignor Grillo's astonishing volte-face - priests are often the first, and best qualified, to debunk reported \"miracles\", if only to reassure those who might reject a church that embraces superstition. Their lack of scientific expertise has even led some priests to call on help from the unlikeliest sources, such as the Italian Committee for Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CICAP). Founded by a group of scientists in 1989, CICAP has close links with similar organisations in the US, where investigations into pious frauds have recently uncovered numbers of serious crimes committed within the church. Although best known for investigations into psychic healing and extra-sensory perception, one of CICAP's founder members, Luigi Garlaschelli, is increasingly focusing his attention on pious frauds, sometimes at the request of the clergy. Although he has not been asked to investigate the weeping Madonna of Civitavecchia, he has followed events closely and taken part in TV debates on the case.</p> <p>When not at his day job as head of the department of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, near Milan, Garlaschelli, a small, bearded man with a mischievous grin, is Italy's foremost investigator of \"miracles\" involving tears and blood. He invites me to his laboratory on a scorching Saturday afternoon, to demonstrate how statues can be made to weep and bleed. He brings out a selection of male and female plaster busts, their faces streaked and eyes rimmed bright red.</p> <p>One is a kitsch replica of the head of Michelangelo's David, the top neatly sawn off. Garlaschelli takes the detached section, and pops it on and off like the lid of a teapot, the join hidden by the curls of hair: inside are two thin plastic tubes connected to a hollow central chamber and glued at the other end behind each of the eyes. Other busts have one or more tiny holes drilled into their scalps, and are hollow inside or contain a small cavity behind the eyes.</p> <p>The mechanisms all work on a similar principle. \"The statue must be of thin, porous plaster or ceramic, and glazed all over outside, allowing the material to absorb fluid without anything seeping out,\" says Garlaschelli. \"You fill the statue or inner reservoir with water, plain or dyed red. Make tiny, almost invisible pinpricks or scratches in the glaze on the corners of the lower eyelid; the fluid eventually trickles or flows through, and there you have your tears.\"</p> <p>Another method involves applying a minuscule trace of red dye beneath the eye, like eyeliner, then spraying the face with water or leaving it outdoors to gather dew. Eventually, the dye will begin to run. Using a colourless compound that turns red when it comes into contact with the vapour of ammonia gives an even more dramatic effect, like the trick of writing with invisible ink.</p> <p>The notion that an unsophisticated man such as Gregori would go to such lengths strikes me as unlikely. Garlaschelli agrees, maintaining that most icons are \"magicked up\" far more crudely. \"I am not suggesting that the Civitavecchia Madonna involved any of these methods, even if the statue was replaced before testing, which, of course, it could have been. The most likely explanation is that someone pricked or cut their finger and smeared the blood on to the eyes of the statue and let it trickle down. The imagination and self-delusion of the onlookers, including that of Monsignor Grillo, does the rest. Trivial, but this is the way it goes very often!\"</p> <p>But what about the forensic examiners' report that ruled out any tricks? \"If you recall, what they said was, 'The statue does not contain any trick, and the blood is real blood.' Which translates to: 'Science rules out tricks - it can only be a miracle.' You can lie, or mislead, even by saying the truth. And when the bishop declared that it had wept in his hands, the forensic examiner reported that he could not doubt it, since it came from extremely reliable sources.\"</p> <p>Garlaschelli shrugs. He has studied a series of photographs taken at various times during the five-day lacrimazioni in Civitavecchia which, he says, prove that the bloodstains did not change shape throughout the period. Although more than 60 witnesses testified to the theological commission that they saw blood trickle from the statue's eyes on different dates, he believes that, given the emotionally charged occasion, they saw what they wanted to, imagined or were told they would see.</p> <p>\"Blood smeared on by someone's cut finger would certainly continue trickling for a while. Even when drying, it may give an impression of newness. The right thing to do would have been immediately to lock the statue in a transparent case, in front of a video camera and a couple of guards, and see if the weeping took place.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,408738,00.html\">The crying game (continued)</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "What strikes people most when they first see the Weeping Madonna of Civitavecchia is her size. The white glazed plaster statue is only 16 inches high, her face, with its downcast eyes, no bigger than a man's thumb. Originally bought from a souvenir stall at the shrine of Our Lady at Medjugorje in Bosnia, she cost less than a fiver, but, as mass-produced religious statuettes go, is surprisingly untrashy. For the past five years, La Madonnina, the little madonna, as she is known locally, has stood behind bulletproof glass in the little church of St Agostino in Pantano, a poor agricultural suburb of the port of Civitavecchia, near Rome. Every year, she attracts thousands of pilgrims. Of the scores of \"miracles\" reported in Italy during the lead-up to the millennium, only this \"weeping Madonna\", who even has her own website, continues to bring in the charabancs, transforming a once unknown chapel off a dirt-track into an international religious shrine. However, anyone hoping to see her weep, or detect traces of blood on her cheeks, will be disappointed. Since allegedly weeping tears of blood in front of thousands of witnesses in February 1995, La Madonnina has remained dry-eyed and all traces of blood have long since faded. Which is more than can be said for the controversy that surrounds her. La Madonnina's worldwide renown is due as much to her supposed mystical powers as to the fact that, for the past five years, she has been the subject of an unprecedented and bizarre criminal investigation in which the Italian authorities have become embroiled in a so-called \"pious fraud\", a charge normally ignored, or dealt with by the church. In this case, the Procura, or district attorney, is determined to expose La Madonnina's tears as a hoax and identify the culprits as the statue's owner, Fabio Gregori, and his family. The enquiry appears set to run indefinitely and has all the makings of an absurdist melodrama, involving the diverging interests of anti-cult campaigners, judicial authorities, the Catholic church, and the mayor of Civitavecchia, Pietro Tidei, a communist nonbeliever who is determined that the shrine at Pantano should become as commercially viable as Lourdes, Fatima or Medjugorje. Meanwhile, like many thousands of believers, Gregori, a 37-year-old electrician from Pantano, believes that what he witnessed five years ago was a miracle. What he also knows is that it has changed his life, largely for the worse. It began, like most mystical experiences, in the most humdrum circumstances. As a devout Catholic, Gregori was overjoyed when his local priest, Father Don Pablo Martin, returned from a visit to Medjugorje in September 1994 and gave him a plaster statuette of the Virgin to protect his home and family. With nothing to distinguish it from the serried ranks of Madonnas around the Bosnian pilgrimage site, Father Pablo nevertheless believed that this one had special powers, claiming he was guided by one of Italy's most celebrated religious figures, the late Capuchin friar Padre Pio, to bring the statue back to Civitavecchia, where \"the most beautiful event of this life\" would occur. Five months on, an event did indeed occur that propelled the tiny hamlet into the spotlight. On the afternoon of Thursday, February 2, 1995, Gregori was hurrying to mass when his six-year-old daughter Jessica's shrieks pierced the air. \"Papa, Papa, come and look. The Madonnina is crying. There's blood everywhere!\" Rushing to join her at the little stone shrine he had built in the garden, he saw, he says, red liquid well up in the statuette's eyes and trickle down her cheeks and gown. Deeply shaken, he drove to mass, where he recounted the incident to Father Pablo. Within hours, news of the \"weeping\" had spread throughout the district and crowds of acquaintances and strangers began gathering outside his gate. The circus had begun. Throughout the weekend, as the story hit the headlines, the faithful and the merely curious, including reporters and TV crews, thronged in their thousands down the small country lane to Gregori's house, pushing into his small garden, praying, weeping, gawping, chattering and crossing themselves as they filed past the tiny statue before shuffling out again to gossip and speak to the press. \"It was a mass invasion, they were swinging from the trees,\" recalls Scottish-born Carmela Dinardo, who runs Civitavecchia's foreign language school. \"You couldn't move for cars, buses and people blocking the way to his home. I wanted to see the Madonna, too, and drove down there, but was forced to park far away and walk. It took hours to reach the shrine. They were battering down his gate, hundreds of people at a time trampling around his garden. People had come from all over Italy. The Gregoris simply locked themselves inside the house.\" After several people had tried to handle the statue and touch the blood, police were called to maintain order at the site. By late Sunday, February 5, the statuette had, according to many witnesses, wept blood 13 times. By the following day, Gregori could take the strain no longer and, pursued by paparazzi, delivered the statuette to Father Pablo at St Agostino for safekeeping. Then he locked the gates to his garden and put up a notice: \"Please don't stop here. The Madonna is no longer here.\" And there the drama should have ended. It was, after all, just the latest in a long line of incidents involving holy effigies, animated statues and sightings of the Virgin Mary during the 90s throughout the world. In India and England, reports that animal statues at various Hindu temples had begun \"drinking\" milk also drew crowds for several months. Even in Italy, with nine separate lacrimazioni (weepings) reported in the first two months of 1995 alone, belief had begun to give way to scepticism as each incident was either dismissed due to unreliable eyewitness reports or found to be a practical joke or some natural phenomenon, such as dewdrops forming on a statue. Why should La Madonnina of Civitavecchia be any different? And what makes locals, such as Dinardo, an ardent believer in miracles, and her friend, Christiana Vallarino, a local reporter from Il Messaggero, who saw the tears but insists it's a clever trick, still argue over the incident in the cafes on Civitavecchia's seafront? The answer lies in the web of intrigue that still surrounds the case, and speculation over one of the most colourful characters involved in it, Monsignor Girolamo Grillo, the bishop of Civitavecchia. As he welcomes me to his house to tell me about the story, Monsignor Grillo, a jocular 70-year-old known locally as \"il grillo parlante\" (the talking cricket) because of his outspokenness, still chuckles over his initial reaction. After taking the statuette from Gregori, Father Pablo delivered a report to Grillo, describing what had occurred in the family's garden that weekend. Phoning him several hours later to ask him what to do with the statue, Father Pablo was shocked at the bishop's response: \"I tore up the report and threw it in the bin and told Don Pablo to destroy the statue immediately, so as to end all this trouble! I had no doubt it was a hoax. Naturally, I started hearing from angry parishioners condemning me for not believing in all this rubbish.\" There were well-founded reasons for Monsignor Grillo's wish to distance himself from \"this rubbish\". According to rumour, the area around Civitavecchia is heaving with Jehovah's Witnesses, occult groups and Satanists, any of whom could have planned a hoax. More significantly, the Vatican, sensitive to charges of superstition, favours a cautious attitude towards reported \"miracles\", especially those involving inanimate objects, rather than mystic \"seers\" as in Fatima. His next step, which was to phone the police and ask them to investigate the Gregori family, therefore, seems logical, as does his request to his own doctor to carry out tests on the \"blood\" now congealed on the statue. What he wasn't prepared for was the result: the substance was haemoglobin. That report, says Monsignor Grillo, only strengthened his resolve to expose the trick. \"The Gregoris, I found out, were simple, poor, hard-working, local people, honest and devoutly religious, with no criminal record. I even did an exorcism on them, believing it was a satanic set up.\" But, being something of an amateur sleuth, Bishop Grillo wouldn't let the matter rest. Father Pablo, disobeying instructions, had given the statue to one of Gregori's brothers, so Monsignor Grillo persuaded the family to let him take it to Rome for analysis of the bloodstains and x-rays of the structure. The tests were repeated several times by separate teams, one headed by Professor Angelo Fiori at the Vatican's Gemelli hospital, the other by Rome's leading forensic medical examiner and DNA expert, Giancarlo Umani-Ronchi, director of the Institute for Forensic Medicine at the University of Rome. \"When I handed the statue in at the lab, they assured me it would turn out to be animal blood,\" laughs Monsignor Grillo, drawing out the story for effect. \"Then they found it was human blood.\" But greater revelations were to come: repeated analysis and DNA tests established that it was male blood, while a series of x-rays and CAT scans of the statue itself confirmed that it was solid, with no sign of having been rigged. \"That actually increased my doubts. Obviously it was a hoax. The blood of Our Lady ought to have been female, no?\" After reporting these developments to the Vatican, Monsignor Grillo was authorised to set up a theological commission to study the case. It was the start of many sleepless nights, he says. On March 1, soon after the statue had been returned to him, CODACONS, Italy's largest consumer protection group, alarmed at extensive media coverage of the case, issued a formal complaint against \"unknown persons\". The charge was \"abuso della credulita popolare\" (abuse of the people's belief), under a law introduced in 1930 to deter magicians and hoaxers from duping the public. This was followed by an allegation of fraud from a prominent Italian helpline, Telefono Antiplagio, run by Professor Giovanni Panunzio, a children's religion teacher in Sardinia and director of the Italian Committee to Help Victims of Charlatans and Gurus. Again, Monsignor Grillo admits giving police the go-ahead to investigate. \"I called in the law, hoping they would finally help me prove the weeping was a joke, because I was so sure it was.\" But when police raided the homes of all four Gregori brothers and their mother at dawn on March 8, turning everything up-side down in the search for evidence of trickery, they drew a blank. Fabio Gregori's ordeal, however, was far from over. Under Italian law, once an accusation is made, the public prosecutor is obliged to open a full-scale criminal investigation, which can drag on for years, even if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute. What happened a week later added a whole new dimension to an already farcical situation. While saying mass at home with his sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two Romanian nuns, the bishop claims that La Madonnina cried tears of blood as he held her in his hands. Although he announced what he had witnessed in a TV interview a week later, in effect endorsing the miracle, he refuses to use the word miracle: \"It's a mystery - there is no rational explanation,\" he tells me, with the first sign of gravitas that afternoon. The bishop's announcement - carried out against the advice of the Vatican - merely cranked up Antonio Abano, the public prosecutor, who enlisted Criminal-pol, the Italian equivalent of the FBI, to dig further into the case. Abano ordered the bishop to hand over La Madonnina and requested all male members of the Gregori family to submit blood samples for DNA testing against that on the statute. Neither request was met. \"Since I had witnessed the weeping myself, the Vatican gave me authority to tell the police to stay away from the case and not permit the statue to be confiscated,\" says Monsignor Grillo. \"That didn't go down so well. Now the prosecutor was convinced that Gregori and I were in this together. They accused me of being in cahoots with the Vatican and both of us of fraud. At this stage, they would have liked to put me in jail for being the hoaxer, but a bishop is still a bishop, so they tried to seize the Madonnina.

Since then, the shrine of La Madonnina has become a magnet for tourists. To cope with the influx, Mayor Tidei has allocated billions of lire for the construction of roads, street lighting, drainage and toilets, parking facilities, a pilgrim's hostel and a large consecrated marquee to meet the demand for extra services, vigils and communions. Despite this, Tidei grumbles that St Agostino has not yet made the big time. The planned construction of a large new sanctuary is awaiting the church's go-ahead. \"The bishop won't give me the opportunity to promote it as a commercial venture.

The suggestion that Gregori may have resorted to such tricks has, says Forestieri, reduced his client to an emotional wreck. However, many, including devout Catholics, favour any debate, no matter how dressed up as showbusiness, believing that a sinister conspiracy to undermine the church lies behind events in Civitavecchia. Panunzio of the anti-charlatan hotline, who has conducted his own research into phoney miracles, is convinced that Gregori was set up. \"Almost certainly he and Bishop Grillo were cheated by unscrupulous people who want to increase superstition and decrease faith. Exploitation of holy icons is widespread among occultists.\" Recently, Panunzio's organisation has examined about 10 \"weeping\" icons and similar phenomena throughout Italy, and dismissed them all as \"illusions or jokes\". In the case of Civitavecchia, he claims to have received several tip-offs: \"In December 1994, a man, who introduced himself as an expert in 'esotericism', called me and warned me about a 'weeping' that was being planned in Civitavecchia. Don't you think that's a very strange coincidence?\" After the incident, he received an anonymous fax from someone claiming repentance for being behind events at Pantano, and admitted that it had begun as a carnival prank, but that \"fanatical colleagues\" had taken it further. Although Panunzio counts himself among a growing category of special investigators of pious frauds, being a non-scientist who often relies on the magician Barrago's expertise in identifying possible trickery, he comes across more as an enthusiastic dabbler. What really disqualifies him from being a rigorous, impartial investigator is that he has his own agenda: to strengthen true religious faith and stamp out rampant occultism and New Age beliefs, which he likens to pornography. With Satan apparently lurking around every corner, these forces of darkness, he says, are especially widespread in Italy (in fact, the highest number of religious \"miracles\" are reported in Ireland, the United States and Italy). Even if the truth behind La Madonnina is never revealed, the case, by setting a precedent for police involvement in church affairs, raises important questions over the whole issue of \"pious fraud\" and the rigour with which such apparent misdemeanours are investigated. In their persistent hounding of Fabio Gregori when so many other people might have played a part in the incident, the authorities in Civitavecchia have displayed an astonishing lack of common sense. Why else enlist the help of illusionists whose prime instinct is to entertain? Theories, such as those propounded by Barrago, seem to have convinced prosecutors that the \"weeping\" was the result of some absurdly elaborate mechanism, when in fact there is likely to be a far simpler, if mundane explanation. One problem is the dubious presumption that religious hoaxes aren't \"real\" crimes, since only the gullible believe in miracles and thus \"have it coming\", which prevents most prosecutors and detectives from taking these incidents seriously in the first place. And among those who do, how many are sufficiently familiar with the \"backstage\" workings of the church to know what to look for in such investigations? Obviously very few. Which is why, as happened initially in Civitavecchia - until Monsignor Grillo's astonishing volte-face - priests are often the first, and best qualified, to debunk reported \"miracles\", if only to reassure those who might reject a church that embraces superstition. Their lack of scientific expertise has even led some priests to call on help from the unlikeliest sources, such as the Italian Committee for Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CICAP). Founded by a group of scientists in 1989, CICAP has close links with similar organisations in the US, where investigations into pious frauds have recently uncovered numbers of serious crimes committed within the church. Although best known for investigations into psychic healing and extra-sensory perception, one of CICAP's founder members, Luigi Garlaschelli, is increasingly focusing his attention on pious frauds, sometimes at the request of the clergy. Although he has not been asked to investigate the weeping Madonna of Civitavecchia, he has followed events closely and taken part in TV debates on the case. When not at his day job as head of the department of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, near Milan, Garlaschelli, a small, bearded man with a mischievous grin, is Italy's foremost investigator of \"miracles\" involving tears and blood. He invites me to his laboratory on a scorching Saturday afternoon, to demonstrate how statues can be made to weep and bleed. He brings out a selection of male and female plaster busts, their faces streaked and eyes rimmed bright red. One is a kitsch replica of the head of Michelangelo's David, the top neatly sawn off. Garlaschelli takes the detached section, and pops it on and off like the lid of a teapot, the join hidden by the curls of hair: inside are two thin plastic tubes connected to a hollow central chamber and glued at the other end behind each of the eyes. Other busts have one or more tiny holes drilled into their scalps, and are hollow inside or contain a small cavity behind the eyes. The mechanisms all work on a similar principle. \"The statue must be of thin, porous plaster or ceramic, and glazed all over outside, allowing the material to absorb fluid without anything seeping out,\" says Garlaschelli. \"You fill the statue or inner reservoir with water, plain or dyed red. Make tiny, almost invisible pinpricks or scratches in the glaze on the corners of the lower eyelid; the fluid eventually trickles or flows through, and there you have your tears.\" Another method involves applying a minuscule trace of red dye beneath the eye, like eyeliner, then spraying the face with water or leaving it outdoors to gather dew. Eventually, the dye will begin to run. Using a colourless compound that turns red when it comes into contact with the vapour of ammonia gives an even more dramatic effect, like the trick of writing with invisible ink. The notion that an unsophisticated man such as Gregori would go to such lengths strikes me as unlikely. Garlaschelli agrees, maintaining that most icons are \"magicked up\" far more crudely. \"I am not suggesting that the Civitavecchia Madonna involved any of these methods, even if the statue was replaced before testing, which, of course, it could have been. The most likely explanation is that someone pricked or cut their finger and smeared the blood on to the eyes of the statue and let it trickle down. The imagination and self-delusion of the onlookers, including that of Monsignor Grillo, does the rest. Trivial, but this is the way it goes very often!\" But what about the forensic examiners' report that ruled out any tricks? \"If you recall, what they said was, 'The statue does not contain any trick, and the blood is real blood.' Which translates to: 'Science rules out tricks - it can only be a miracle.' You can lie, or mislead, even by saying the truth. And when the bishop declared that it had wept in his hands, the forensic examiner reported that he could not doubt it, since it came from extremely reliable sources.\" Garlaschelli shrugs. He has studied a series of photographs taken at various times during the five-day lacrimazioni in Civitavecchia which, he says, prove that the bloodstains did not change shape throughout the period. Although more than 60 witnesses testified to the theological commission that they saw blood trickle from the statue's eyes on different dates, he believes that, given the emotionally charged occasion, they saw what they wanted to, imagined or were told they would see. \"Blood smeared on by someone's cut finger would certainly continue trickling for a while. Even when drying, it may give an impression of newness. The right thing to do would have been immediately to lock the statue in a transparent case, in front of a video camera and a couple of guards, and see if the weeping took place.\" The crying game (continued)",

      "body": "<p>Christmas, like the sperm whale, comes but once a year. This is a major relief to the poor people who have to organise Christmas parties. But if you are determined to shoulder the responsibility, these are the key things you need to bear in mind in order to put on the kind of party everyone talks about for the whole year after - or, better still, is too embarrassed to talk about for the whole year after. </p> <p><strong> VENUE </strong><br> </p> <p> The golden rule is to organise your Christmas party the January before. You know that really groovy venue you've had in mind all year? Well, that's the very same venue that's been booked all year by the Really Efficient Company. If you leave it until November or even December to organise the office party, you'll be left with a choice: the upstairs room in the roughest pub in Europe or your own front room. </p> <p>When you present these options to your bosses, they will reject them out of hand and will come up with their own brilliant idea along the lines of, 'Let's take over a big warehouse and convert it into a Turkish harem. You know, cushions everywhere, silk wall hangings, eunuchs with little trays of Turkish delight.' Then they'll give you \u00a350 to make all of this happen. </p> <p>That's why you often turn up to a Christmas party in a completely bare and freezing warehouse that has some kind of secondhand jet engine to heat it and one paper plate with a Fry's Turkish Delight on it. If this is your venue, you're going to need an awful lot of alcohol and music to generate any kind of party atmosphere. </p> <p><strong> PARTYGOERS </strong><br> </p> <p> Any fewer than 20 guests, and you'll never get a party atmosphere going. When you arrive at a party, there are four kinds of people: those you know and like - this is a really important group, because there's nothing worse than arriving at a party and not knowing anyone. </p> <p>The second group of people are those whom you recognise but don't like. It's amazing how quickly the second group get promoted to the first if they're the only ones you recognise. That's because recognising someone at a party is more important than liking them. </p> <p>The third group of people are those you don't recognise and don't like. Arriving at a party, you'll immediately scan the room and see people you don't want to talk to for the entire evening (or the rest of your life, for that matter). In party terms, they are dead wood - though it's worth remembering that one person's dead wood is another person's firelighter. </p> <p>The fourth, and most important, group of people are those you don't recognise but you do like the look of. That's because the best parties of all time are when you see a stranger you fancy, you get on with them and then you get off with them. You need a minimum of 20 people to get at least one person everyone will fancy. To be safe, try to have between 200 and 300 people, although this might not be practical in the upstairs room of the Wagon &amp; Horses. </p> <p>If you work in an office, you can be sure of being invited to at least one party a year - and that is the office party. If you haven't even been invited to that one, then you should check to see whether you have a bad case of PO (personality odour) - PO is like BO, in that nobody likes you if you have it and no one's going to tell you when you've got it. </p> <p><strong> ALCOHOL </strong><br> </p> <p> Party atmosphere is what happens when you dissolve inhibitions in alcohol and mix thoroughly. Any alcohol will do. The rule for buying alcohol for parties is to write down the most you've ever drunk in one session and then multiply it by the number of people at the party, because that's how much will be drunk, spilt and stolen. Quality of drink should decline with time elapsed. By all means start off with the champers, but once people are in the lurching, shouting and sweating phase, start dishing out the meths and oven cleaner. </p> <p><strong> MUSIC </strong><br> </p> <p> Dancing is, as they say, a vertical expression of a horizontal desire. Which may explain why some men dance as though their innermost horizontal desire is to be working under their Opel Mantra. </p> <p>Music isn't just for dancing; it's to fill in all the embarrassing gaps in the conversation that occur at any party. At the beginning of the evening, the music needs to be loud enough so that everyone can talk above it, but right behind you when the conversation flags. Once people run out of things to say (which is exactly one third of the way into the party), it's time to turn the music up so that all communication other than through body language is futile. </p> <p>Music should be picked on the basis that all the tracks are floor-fillers. This doesn't mean selecting a band so dire that everyone brings up their dinner. It means that the intro of the song is felt directly in the hips of everyone within a 20-metre radius. Never play music with a strange beat that's impossible to dance to, as nobody wants to look like a confused robot on the dancefloor. </p> <p>Getting on the dancefloor is a key juncture at any party. You'll always have a couple of extroverts who get on the dancefloor way too early, when they're not even squiffy. Often, it's the appalling couple who do ballroom dancing and who manage to find a way of doing a quickstep to Fat Boy Slim. </p> <p>Eventually, people start getting up on the floor. Generally, it's the women first, dancing together in a manner which implies that the idea of men joining them would be complete anathema. Finally, the men decide that, if they're going to get to the women, they're going to have to get on the dancefloor. They'll pick their target and then, ever so subtly, dance in front of them as if they were a riot policeman limbering up for a baton charge. Any woman who dances directly opposite them for more than four seconds is marked down as an option for snogging. </p> <p><strong> FUN </strong><br> </p> <p> The British like to take their pleasures raw. Usually, this means rapid intake of alcohol followed by very rapid sex or violence. Good parties are when the excitement builds slowly, and this means adding a bit of structure to the event. People like playing games, and any excuse for having a bit of fun and larking about is a must for parties. This can involve karaoke, a review, drinking games, food fights, murder mysteries, impromptu wedges for the entire accounts department etc. What this categorically does not mean is singing songs around a piano - although this is in fact a very efficient way of creating a great party atmosphere in the room furthest away from the piano. </p> <p>Not all parties are fun. Statistics have shown that only 42% of parties are fun, and of these only 11% are really good fun. The people who put these statistics together have their own party at the end of the year. It's not one of the 11%. Or the 42%. </p> <p><strong> FANCY DRESS </strong><br> </p> <p> Fancy dress is always a good way of making a party more fun. That's because it gives men a chance to dress up without in any way undermining their 100% masculinity. It's also a way of getting rid of your inhibitions before you even arrive at a party. It's very difficult to be shy and retiring at a party when you're standing there dressed up as Catherine the Great of Russia with her pet horse. </p> <p>Crucially, it also gives you something to talk about. You can go up to someone and ask them whether they've come to the party as Goofy and then discover that they actually haven't bothered with fancy dress at all. Try to avoid the theme Tarts and Vicars. This is always invented by the grunting old marketing director as a way of seeing all the young totty in their undies and making absolutely no effort him-self, apart from turning his collar back to front. </p> <p>General themes are best, such as Oscar Night or The Dark Side or The Agricultural Revolution. Whatever theme you choose, you can absolutely guarantee that you'll get at least one each of the following turning up. First, there'll be the person who is so cool that they've come as the incredibly cool person they always are. Second, there will be the mystery person in the gorilla suit - it's a fantastic likeness of a gorilla, but no one knows who's inside; they have great fun at the beginning of the evening, when they go around acting out King Kong with the ladies, but the fun goes out of their evening when they realise they can't get the head off. And last, you'll always get the person, usually with a high forehead, who does something rather odd - if, say, the theme of the evening is Hi-tech, don't be surprised when this person turns up with a roll of film on each shoulder. If you can be bothered to ask what they've come as, expect the answer to be \"a Parallel Processor\". </p> <p>These kinds of people usually have a rather quiet evening and end up, out of sheer desperation, getting off with the unknown person dressed in the gorilla suit. </p> <p><strong> SEX </strong><br> </p> <p> Sexual chemistry, preferably of the most volatile kind, is the final and absolutely vital ingredient of any party. This means that you really must have a mix of the sexes. Eighty men and three women isn't a party; it's just asking for trouble (unless 60 of the men are gay, in which case it's party, party, party). </p> <p>The rules of good sex in real life apply to parties also: first of all, clothing is vital. No one has ever had their passions inflamed by jogging pants. If you're planning to be undressed later, you need to get dressed up first. This is more of an opportunity for women then men. When men get dressed up, this means blowing their nose and adjusting their flies. Women, especially those who ordinarily wear a business suit, can do the full Cinderella. When they turn up in a one-piece rubber body stocking, they can instantly reverse five years of human resources initiatives on gender sensitivity. </p> <p>Nobody goes to a Christmas party in anticipation of sparkling conversation or because they've been waiting all year for a pineapple chunk and cheese on a stick. Parties are about getting off with people. Ideally, they're about snogging someone really fit - although, to be honest, snogging anything with a pulse will do. For snogging, you have to decide whether you're going for random snogging or targeted snogging. Random snogging is when you're so drunk you could snog the photocopier and is practised by all men still at the party at three in the morning, still on their feet and still alone. </p> <p>Targeted snogging is when you snog the person in the office who you've fancied all year. You do a lot of dancing together, you make sure you're drinking at the same rate, then there's a slow dance, followed by the breath of fresh air or cigarette. At this stage, you forget all the things that have held you back for the past year - such as your long-term partner, self-respect, compatibility, dignity, reputation, status, strict religious principles, Neighbourhood Watch membership and company ethical policy - and suddenly find yourselves clawing at each other in what looks like a simultaneous combination of drowning and administering the kiss of life. </p> <p><strong> THE MORNING AFTER </strong><br> </p> <p> The reason why end-of-year bonuses are paid at the end of the year is because they're the only thing that will get you back into the office after the phenomenal embarrassment of what you did at the party. </p> <p>The acid test of a good party is how you feel the morning after. If you can feel anything the morning after, it wasn't a good party. When you wake the following afternoon, you naturally have a hangover the like of which no human has ever suffered and lived. As this begins to fade, a rising tide of embarrassment and shame takes over. With luck, you won't remember half of what you did and nor will anybody in the office.

      "body": "<p>It was pitiable to behold. On this particular night of the long, humiliating cock-up of the US presidential election, the grapevine had Bush sworn in, and any New Yorker with the remotest pretensions towards cultural or cerebral activity was exhibiting the symptoms of severe reactive depression. Those with tickets for Yasmina Reza's sell-out play, The Unexpected Man, zombied along Broadway, took their extremely expensive theatre seats and sat there in stunned silence until it was time to go home. God alone knows what they were thinking. On stage, two of Europe's most sophisticated exponents of the English language turned words to symphonies, while the best they can do is elect a president who can't put a cogent sentence together. Oh shame! What will become of us? There was not a ripple, not a chuckle, not a solitary comprehending inhalation, just this terrible, unremitting silence from beginning to end. Then the sound of seals slapping their fins together. What actors call a dead house. </p> <p>It was him she felt sorry for. Poor Alan Bates. He has to carry the piece for its first 15 minutes, which isn't easy at the best of times, even when you're as brilliant as he is. Eileen Atkins heard the awful silence enveloping the pair of them and knew his cadences were spot on, his irony just so, his undertow of loneliness precisely as he would wish it to be. These things just happen. There are times when stage fright makes you vomit, times when you hear yourself mis-time a phrase or bungle an inflection and you have to hold your nerve and force yourself to stay in the moment. When worse comes to the worst, as it just did, you have to remember that if you can't take rejection you shouldn't be an actor. They comforted each other afterwards, repaired to the nearest hostelry and drank more than was strictly necessary. </p> <p>The morning after, Miss Atkins indulged herself in an extra hour in bed with the phone switched off, ate a wholesome breakfast, took her vitamins and went on for the matinee. By which time the count was on again, the pall lifted and the audience enjoyed the play with something approaching audible responsiveness. That night there was actual enthusiasm; Alan's monologue got the snickers, giggles and guffaws it deserved, the house was alive with concentrated appreciation and, when it was over, rose to its feet with nicely modulated bravos. New York, the day, the actors are back on track, the dreadful may never happen. </p> <p>Thoroughly gratified, Miss Atkins joined a few chums for a post-performance supper, during which she was heard to remark that she felt as though she had just been fucked. She meant it, of course, in the nicest possible way. In fact, she is looking quite beautiful in a post-coital way; beautiful, as Philip Larkin once said of Kingsley Amis's first wife, without being remotely pretty. The critics here had raved about the turn of her ankle, the curve of her cheek. One of them called her sexy, which is particularly pleasing to a woman of 60-something about to be shown on British television as a mean old bat with a mouth like a trap. Not that such a persona is unusual for her. When she's not doing something pure and classical, she's most likely to emerge on film or television as somebody unappetisingly post-menopausal who's just done something particularly unlovely with a kirby grip. </p> <p>What appealed to her about Reza's two- hander was its sexiness: a middle-aged romance defined by the experiences of the hearts and minds of the protagonists, unhindered by the mendacious imperatives of their hormones. Tonight she is in excellent form. Someone asks her about a theatrical anecdote recounted by her hairdresser, apparently, featuring Atkins and luminaries of the British stage. She listens politely, widens her eyes and says, \"Christ, talk about Chinese whispers.\" </p> <p>Her first-hand version tells you all you need to know about the personalities of the actors involved and hinges upon the night, five or so years ago, when the snow-making machine for the stage production of John Gabriel Borkman went on the blink. The stage manager had the task of going into three dressing rooms to inform the three stars of the disaster. There would be no snow in the snow scene. Eileen's response was to lose her rag. \"What's the matter with those bloody fools,\" she raved, \"can't they even do the simplest thing.\" Vanessa Redgrave took it sweetly. \"Oh dear,\" she murmured, \"perhaps we could all tear paper up into little bits and we could throw them up in the air.\" Paul Scofield continued to regard his face in the mirror. Then (and she does a perfect imitation of his growl) \"No snow. No Sco.\" </p> <p>\"No show!\" the table rocks. \" No Sco!\" </p> <p>For the duration of The Unexpected Man, Miss Atkins is residing in a small apartment in a hotel described by an Irish poet friend of hers as like living inside your Auntie Hilda's knickers. You can see what he meant. Her quarters are quaintly film-starry, all pink and chintzy-frilly, not at all like her. All available flat surfaces are covered with books about or by Virginia Woolf, first-night gifts from friends and well-wishers. She doesn't know what made them think she hadn't already read them all, but it was nice of them, wasn't it? </p> <p>Against the incongruous, rented background, her straight-up-and-down, black- and-white figure reminds you that there are aesthetic rules for correct bodily proportion to which we must all aspire, and that these are probably what you're looking at. Being herself, without a fictive motivation inside her bones, she moves fluidly, like a dancer. Like all pathologically impatient people, she can't be bothered to prevaricate. Her back is precisely as broad as her front, and you get to see them both at the same time. She's not always easy, her husband, producer Bill Shepherd, told me while imparting her whereabouts: \"One of the things I love about Eileen is she hasn't the faintest idea how good she is.\" And she hasn't. She just gets on with it. Does what she has to. </p> <p>A cursory glance at the record of her long career tells the story of her driving force in no uncertain terms - she has never allowed herself to be involved in anything vaguely resembling mediocrity. It's as though she suddenly popped up from obscurity as Jaquenetta in Love's Labour's Lost at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, and then spent the rest of her life swanning around the orchard of all that is great and good, picking one plum role after another like a scrumper with an in-built shit detector. </p> <p>Her co-stars seem invariably to have been lions such as Laurence Olivier or Alec Guinness, and she doesn't seem to have ever bothered to open a script unless it emanated from Shakespeare or Shaw or, at a pinch, Eliot, Tennessee Williams, DH Lawrence, Edward Albee, Robert Bolt or John Osborne. </p> <p>In the parallel universe of her writing career, she has rarely stooped beneath the rarefied aura of Virginia Woolf and her chums. Why bother? She routinely collected posh awards for whatever she involved herself in, here and in America over the past 35 years, culminating, in 1998, when she was rather pleased to get the Olivier award for The Unexpected Man, swiftly followed by the Evening Standard gong for best screenwriter with her screenplay for Mrs Dalloway. When she gets a minute, she'll complete the film script of her play Vita And Virginia - well, just tart it up a bit, it's more or less done - and think about what to do next. </p> <p>On this muggy morning in Manhattan, she feels she must address herself to more personal biographic matters, which she hasn't ever really got down to in a serious way before. She's not sure she's telling the truth, though, because she's not sure what the truth really is. Memory is a movable feast, we rewrite the past as we go along and, besides, whatever she says about her origins will be hotly disputed by Ron, her surviving sibling. However, as the child of elderly parents - always assuming her desire to be exposed as a changeling continues to be thwarted - she feels entitled to trace her direct blood line back to the 19th century and the photographic image of her maternal grandfather, \"the only gorgeous member of the family\". Dark, dark brown eyes, black hair, excitingly foreign, she'd pore over the portrait and ask her mother, was he Italian? Spanish? And her mother would hush her up, no, no, no, don't be so silly, as though the mere thought of being anything other than entirely English, with perhaps a bit of Scottish on dad's side, was somehow shameful, something not quite right in the woodshed. </p> <p>Her mum was intent on bettering herself, not dwelling on dubieties of ancestry. She was knocking 40 when she met Eileen's dad, and, according to family lore, obliged him to marry her in exchange for taking care of his three-year-old daughter while he serviced the automobile of the Portuguese ambassador. He was called an under-chauffeur, which meant that, though he couldn't actually drive a car - he didn't know how - he got to vacuum them and polish their bonnets. When his first wife died, he took up lodging in Eileen's mum's mother's house in Stoke Newington, where they all lived together in quiet desperation and increasingly cramped conditions as the children of the union arrived at a rate of one a year. When she was pregnant for the third time, she opted for an abortion in the interests of health, space and respectability. Then, when her two-year-old died of diphtheria, she realised God had punished her for her wickedness. Life went on in the little house; dad read gas meters, mum sewed for a factory all day and went out at night to be a barmaid in the Elephant &amp; Castle. And that was it until, at the age of 47, she discovered she was pregnant again. </p> <p>\"It's funny,\" Eileen says, \"but I always felt I've come out of a massive row.\" She sounds enigmatic, but it's probably literally true. Her father, it seems, had undergone testicular surgery, a painful and emotionally unmanning experience that prompted a somewhat taunting comment from his good lady. \"I'll show you . . .\" he is supposed to have retaliated and, wallop, Eileen was conceived. She was born in the Salvation Army Home in Clapton, north London, a geographic fact furiously denied by her mother, who insisted until the day she died that it was a hospital, not a home. </p> <p>They were allotted a council house in Tottenham as a prize for the birth of Eileen June. They'd never had it so good. The six of them piled into the two-down, three-up; gran, mum, dad, half-sister, brother and the tiny blonde princess, God's forgiving gift. </p> <p>\"My very first memory of being alive,\" she says 66 years after the event and bright as yesterday, \"is being tossed in the air by my father and laughing and knowing, really knowing, that his was absolute joy.\" She knew that, and she knew that she was unequivocally adored. There was never, ever any doubt about it. She could tell her siblings were miffed, and she knew, even then, she couldn't blame them for that. She was a born dotee and, in the Jesuitical sense, she reciprocated the dote till the age of seven, when she ceased to be pretty and realised she could read and didn't need her dad to tell her his wonderful stories any more. </p> <p>Not to mince words, her dad was a bit on the backward side. He left school, of necessity, at the age of 12 and was known by the children of his acquaintance as \"Uncle Funny Man\" for his amiable, childlike qualities. To Eileen, as she began to look about herself with the critical eye of a seven-year-old, he was just stupid. Irritatingly so. For instance, when they built the first motorway, the M1, he would always pronounce it the M Eye. It made her wince. So she said to him, listen dad, it's not the M Eye. It's the M One. Next time they build a motorway, it'll be the M Two, then the M Three. \"That's right, luv,\" he said cheerfully, \"M Eye.\" </p> <p>She remembers the day she read her first words as one of the greatest moments of her life. She knows exactly where she was in the high street, holding her father's hand, looking at an advertising hoarding with a poster of a man with yellow hair riding a bicycle on top of a jar of Bovril. And the words, \"Bovril is good for you.\" She read them out loud. Oh Bliss. \"Bovril is good for you.\" She didn't feel her father's deflation until they got home and she heard him say to her mother, \"She can read\", in the same tone he'd have used if he'd said, \"I lost her\", or, \"Her leg came off\". From then on books were her ecstasy. Even now, when that unaccountable flooding of euphoria, bliss, happiness, whatever you call it, wafts across her consciousness - you know how it does sometimes, for no particular reason - she gets a flash of the steps leading up to the library in Tottenham, just round the corner from the council house. </p> <p>Her father didn't tune himself easily to the separation caused by his daughter's literacy. Whatever sadness he felt he channelled into a threatening irascibility over the possibility of a ha'penny fine being imposed on her overdue library books. He'd pick them up, sigh, then glare at the date stamps. Stupid, stupid man. Only when she was nearing middle age did she appreciate she was just like him. Thick. She has the same kind of intransigent thickness as the one she despised as a child. She prepares for her roles slowly. S-L-O-W-L-Y and with difficulty. She finds herself at parties with erudite friends, suddenly unable to understand a word anyone's saying, as though something tripped in her brain and she's fallen down a black hole. Once she had a lover who asked her to nip out and move his car. When she told him she couldn't drive, he turned on her. You idiot. He bawled. You incompetent. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I act and I fuck and that's it.\" </p> <p>Her mum was the pushy one. Sometimes now, when she looks down at her own hands, she sees her mother's. She's like her, too. When Eileen was three, a Gypsy came to the door selling lucky heather and clothes pegs. Not getting much change out of Eileen's mum, she gazed at the little girl clinging to her skirts and announced she was to be a world famous dancer. Never one to pass an opportunity, Eileen's mum went straight out and enrolled her in the nearest dance class. </p> <p>She tended to make the best of things, did Eileen's mum. From the age of three, Eileen has been insomniac. Her mum dragged her around doctors' surgeries, distraught for two years, until an old Indian physician explained the problem. \"She has,\" he said, \"too much imagination.\" He prescribed, for reasons best known to himself, breakfast in bed and lots of books. Mother and daughter were well satisfied with the arrangement. Eileen's mum would say, airily, \"Oh no, she never sleeps. She has too much imagination.\" As though vaunting another facet of her own and her daughter's innate superiority. </p> <p>Eileen didn't like dancing class. At the same time, she discovered in herself an aptitude for inventing, telling and maintaining monstrous lies. That and snivelling. While her mother persevered with the famous dancer fantasy, enrolling her in school after school, Eileen invented her own exit lines. \"They're awful to me,\" she'd come home blubbing. \"That Doreen, she put my head down the toilet and pulled the chain.\" She doesn't know to this day where she got it from, or how she held on to her story while the innocent Doreen was pilloried and exiled to outer darkness. \"I was just . . .\" she says, \"a liar.\" </p> <p> In 1939, and for some time after, the exigencies of the war threw up a moral climate among Londoners in which it was considered the height of adult responsibility for parents to evacuate their children to rural locations, where strangers were prevailed upon to take them into their homes, while they remained in the prime bombing area to contribute to the war effort. In deference to this masterstroke of social engineering, Eileen, aged five, was given a bar of chocolate and put on a bus with her 12-year-old brother and innumerable other brats, and transported to a village called Little Baddow in Essex, or, if her brother's recollection is more accurate, Great Baddow. </p> <p>There, in company with some Civil Defence dignitary, the children were trailed from house to house, imploring the residents to take them in. \"Aw, please take us, lady, we're ever so clean,\" she heard her brother beseech a woman at her garden gate, which was bad enough. Then a huge, unpleasant-looking woman arrived, demanded the pretty one with the ringlets and whisked Eileen home to her daughter, who kicked her, pinched her and scoffed her chocolate. Endlessly weeping was again the answer to her problem. She sobbed, she cried, she damned near died, for many months. Then her mother came and took her back to London, omitting to register her as a resident and therefore a schoolchild. She stayed at home with mum, who, to distract her traumatised daughter from the air raids and bomb devastation, redoubled her efforts to give the Gypsy's prediction a helping hand. Tirelessly she sewed the little nymphet costumes. Ruthlessly she hawked the child, now known as \"Baby Eileen\", around the working men's club circuit, where she tappy-toed and sang faintly iffy songs for 15 shillings a pop. </p> <p>Of course, she knew there was something deeply wrong with being Baby Eileen (see picture, page 41). The whole frilly-knickered-bum-chuck, finger-to-dimple awfulness of it all. She once heard a big bosomed chanteuse complain to the management, \"Hey, Buster, how am I meant to compete with that ?\" cocking a thumb in her direction. But 15 bob was a lot of money in those days, and besides, it's not everyone who can boast they were on the same bill as Anna Neagle, at age seven, singing I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy and toe-tapping on a drum at the stage door canteen. </p> <p>In the golden autumn of her elegantly fulfilled life, Miss Atkins has no particular complaint about the bizarre nature of her childhood. \"Bad things happen,\" she says imperiously. \"Cope!\" What really pisses her off is the current vogue for \"counselling\". The slightest thing happens, you witness an accident, you get burgled, some fool sends you a victim support round robin and the offer of \"counselling\". She sounds, she concedes, like some fat old blimp. \"I was thrashed with the buckle end of a belt and it never did me any harm.\" Yes, that's her. A disgustingly reactionary old woman. \"Wheels come off? Get on with it. Cope. Survive.\" </p> <p>She isn't joking. Pragmatic people don't jest about themselves; rather, they sometimes choose to elaborate on one half of a contradiction for reasons of economy or modesty. The fact that life hurts is a banality, and we're all free to choose to be anaesthetised or sensitised or, as Eileen puts it so succinctly, \"You might as well stay indoors for ever, because if you go out the bus conductor might not like you.\" </p> <p>By the time she went to high school, she was bright enough not to give a stuff about being stupid. At the end of a lesson, teachers would say to the class, \"Do you understand?\" then, \"And does Eileen understand?\" and everybody would laugh. She didn't take offence and therefore no offence was intended. School offered \"Drama\", and a drama teacher who allowed her more enthusiastic pupils to improvise and perform their own playlets. Eileen found her niche and stuck to it. </p> <p>In the fourth form she took the title role in the school production of Alice In Wonderland, a triumph that put her occasional scholastic weakness into perspective and gave her an identity she could grow up with. More significantly, perhaps, she found a mentor in the shape of the divinity master, an energetic and singular fellow with a penchant for moulding receptive schoolgirls, who sailed fairly close to the wind by eventually marrying one of them. But his influence on Eileen was purely cerebral, and, in imparting to her the benefits of his mindset, broke down the remaining barriers of her upbringing. They travelled to and from school on the same bus, he took her to the theatre, he explained to her with meticulous care the societal improprieties of capitalism and the moral superiority of socialism. He made her a free thinker. This had the effect of making her perfectly foul to her mum and dad. My, how she knocked and mocked the poor darlings, their narrow-mindedness, the petty parameters of their ambitions for themselves and herself. </p> <p>When she was 14, going on 15, she took it upon herself to address a Mr Robert Atkins, a Royal Shakespeare Company director with an encouragingly familiar name and an on-going production she felt she had something to say about. \"Dear Mr Atkins,\" she wrote. \"The boy who plays the prince in your King John isn't good enough. I could do it better.\" Or words to that effect. He must have been temporarily amused, because he wrote back and suggested she drop in some time. He was less amused when she turned up, having dressed and cosmeticised herself to resemble her idea of a going concern. In fact, he was rather nasty. Good God, he said rudely, we don't want any shop girls here. Flattered, she replied that she wasn't a shop girl, she was a schoolgirl, and threw herself into her little prince speech with no trepidation. After that, he told her to come back when she was a grown-up and she went back to school thinking it had all been rather a good day's work. </p> <p>Eileen didn't get into Rada. Guildhall wasn't keen, either, but signed her up for its teaching course and nobody noticed when she slipped herself in with the drama students and took up their curriculum as well. She wanted to be an actress. She was an actress. </p> <p>At 18, going on 19, she was slogging up and down Charing Cross Road, knocking on doors, looking for jobs. That was how it worked in those days. You put yourself on as many agents' books as there were agents, then you went home and hoped. One Christmas she nearly got a job as a pantomime dog. An agent rang her up and said, quick, tell the truth, how tall are you? Five foot seven, she said. Damn, he said, the costume's for five foot two. Oh, she said, did I say five foot seven, I must have been thinking of my sister, she's the five foot seven one, honest - I'm five foot two. An hour later, she was backstage at some fleapit in Walthamstow with three other contenders. There was no audition, just the skin. So there she was, sweating and straining and yanking at the zip of this ratty costume, her entire life depending on cramming her five foot seven frame into a five foot two dog skin, and failing. No job. No money. No life. </p> <p>Next day brought another great opportunity. A Christmas show in Norwich. \"You'll be met at the station, dearie,\" said the agent. \"It's a three pounds a week, all in. Digs and everything.\" Nothing to lose, everything to gain, she packed her suitcase and boarded a train for Norwich, where she was met at the station by a sad creature with a baby in her arms and a toddler round her ankles who dolefully led her to a bus stop. The bus stopped outside a theatre showing Mother Goose with Cyril Fletcher, and what luck, a young man called Peter Johnson, who she'd been at drama school with. Only it wasn't her stop. </p> <p>The bus sailed on into the countryside and set her and her dismal companions down by a fairground. She was then led through the deepening darkness to a caravan in which a large man, another child and three huge dogs were already ensconced. These, apparently, were her digs. </p> <p>\"Look, lovey,\" said the large man, relieving her of her suitcase and stowing it beyond her reach. \"I know all you girls think you're serious actresses\" - which Eileen thought was perspicacious of him - \"but get a load of this . . .\" and he produced a cardboard box of Turkish harem costumes and flourished it at her in the manner of one offering the answer to a maiden's prayer. \"Go on,\" he said, \"you can choose!\" Her role, it seemed, was to adorn herself in the exotic scanties of her choice, then prance about outside a tent in the cold, exhorting people to buy tickets to watch her host throwing knives at his wife, after which she was welcome to bed down with them in the caravan, babies, dogs, the whole ensemble. </p> <p>And no, there was no telephone and no again, her suitcase was staying put. When in doubt, Eileen reckons, act it out. Certainly, bursting into tears was not going to work this time. So she fingered the horrible costumes in the vile box and said, ooh, yummy, how lovely, she could hardly wait - then, muttering something about finding other digs, ran panic-stricken into the night, leapt aboard a Norwich-bound bus and found herself at the stage door of Mother Goose. \"Mr Johnson,\" she demanded, pulling herself together. \"Mr Peter Johnson.\" Someone bawled along a corridor and Mr Johnson was roused from his kip between matinee and evening shows to emerge in green tights, horns, full Demon King fig, still holding his trident. Even his face was green. He threw his duffle coat over his kit, hailed a cab, bundled Eileen into it, took her back to the fair, thumped on the caravan door and addressed himself to the knife-thrower. \"Evening,\" he barked. \"Sorry. Not suitable. All right? Sorry. Give us the case. Jolly good. Sorry. Thank you. Goodnight.\" Then he drove Eileen to the station and put her on a train back to London. She got home at five in the morning. Her brother Ron let her in. \"Right,\" said Ron, taking one look at her, \"that's it. She's had it. The end.\" </p> <p>But it wasn't. She continued to live at home in Tottenham with her parents and Ron while they gamely supported her in whatever she did as best they could. Her mum and dad sat bored and bewildered through interminable Shakespeares and Ibsens and Chekhovs and, good grief, Strindbergs, while their beloved daughter spread her wings far, far beyond their wildest dreams of her betterment. They'd hoped for a successful chorus girl. They didn't complain. They were, she says, valiant. One day, she thinks she was doing a Strindberg play at the time, she was with her father when they passed a theatre somewhere in Croydon where the late Cicely Courtneidge was starring in an extravaganza called Steppin' High or Steppin' Out or some fine thing. \"Now that's the sort of thing I'd like to see you in,\" her dad said to her. She could have killed him at the time, but now, well, bless. And she wonders if she ever thanked Peter Johnson properly. </p> <p> Six years ago, Eileen was in New York doing a play with Kathleen Turner. The two women didn't get on. Not to put too fine a point on it, they seemed to share a deep and visceral mutual aversion. And then Eileen got cancer. She took her little lump to the doctor and knew immediately what it was because he avoided her eye. She won't hear a word against oncologists. \"Not only do they work impossible hours,\" she says, \"but they're supposed to behave impeccably and be psychiatrists as well.\" Her best friend went with her for the big biopsy report and the best friend burst into tears and everybody looked the other way and, yes, she had cancer and they took her in and cut it out and that was it. Next morning some poor, benighted counsellor came into her room and confided to her that she must be very angry. Angry? asked Eileen. Oh yes, she'd kicked up a fuss because of the noise of the television set next door. Sorry, she said, but how are you supposed to get any sleep with that row going on? No, no, said the counsellor. You must be angry about the cancer. You know, he prompted, you must be thinking, why me? </p> <p>\"Look mate,\" she told him. \"I've been angry all my life. I'm not about to start blaming it on cancer at the age of 61. And I've never thought, 'Why me?' I don't understand 'Why me?' My attitude is: 'Why not me?'\" </p> <p>She took some time off actually to have the cancer, of course. She didn't need to, but she did. They gave her the chemo and the radiation and she lay a bit low, because, to be honest, she didn't want people's eyes sliding off her all over the place. She did some writing, read a bit, ate well and felt perfectly wonderful all the way through. Her hair failed to fall out. She never felt sick. She doesn't know what all the fuss is about. She enjoyed it. She met such marvellous women having chemo. Marvellous. It's nothing to do with being brave, it's about getting on with it. You really have no choice. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you what pisses me off,\" she says, not for the first and I trust not for the last time, \"it's that soppy cow on the Archers, weeping and wailing about her bloody cancer.\" Then she thinks for a minute. Still, she concedes, she is a bit young and she'd better watch what she says about the Archers in case she ends up on it. Come to think of it again, she reckons, she'd rather like that </p> <p>\u0095 Eileen Atkins will appear in The Sleeper on BBC1 at Christmas.</p>",

On this particular night of the long, humiliating cock-up of the US presidential election, the grapevine had Bush sworn in, and any New Yorker with the remotest pretensions towards cultural or cerebral activity was exhibiting the symptoms of severe reactive depression. Those with tickets for Yasmina Reza's sell-out play, The Unexpected Man, zombied along Broadway, took their extremely expensive theatre seats and sat there in stunned silence until it was time to go home. God alone knows what they were thinking. On stage, two of Europe's most sophisticated exponents of the English language turned words to symphonies, while the best they can do is elect a president who can't put a cogent sentence together. Oh shame! What will become of us? There was not a ripple, not a chuckle, not a solitary comprehending inhalation, just this terrible, unremitting silence from beginning to end. Then the sound of seals slapping their fins together. What actors call a dead house. It was him she felt sorry for. Poor Alan Bates. He has to carry the piece for its first 15 minutes, which isn't easy at the best of times, even when you're as brilliant as he is. Eileen Atkins heard the awful silence enveloping the pair of them and knew his cadences were spot on, his irony just so, his undertow of loneliness precisely as he would wish it to be. These things just happen. There are times when stage fright makes you vomit, times when you hear yourself mis-time a phrase or bungle an inflection and you have to hold your nerve and force yourself to stay in the moment. When worse comes to the worst, as it just did, you have to remember that if you can't take rejection you shouldn't be an actor. They comforted each other afterwards, repaired to the nearest hostelry and drank more than was strictly necessary. The morning after, Miss Atkins indulged herself in an extra hour in bed with the phone switched off, ate a wholesome breakfast, took her vitamins and went on for the matinee. By which time the count was on again, the pall lifted and the audience enjoyed the play with something approaching audible responsiveness. That night there was actual enthusiasm; Alan's monologue got the snickers, giggles and guffaws it deserved, the house was alive with concentrated appreciation and, when it was over, rose to its feet with nicely modulated bravos. New York, the day, the actors are back on track, the dreadful may never happen. Thoroughly gratified, Miss Atkins joined a few chums for a post-performance supper, during which she was heard to remark that she felt as though she had just been fucked. She meant it, of course, in the nicest possible way. In fact, she is looking quite beautiful in a post-coital way; beautiful, as Philip Larkin once said of Kingsley Amis's first wife, without being remotely pretty. The critics here had raved about the turn of her ankle, the curve of her cheek. One of them called her sexy, which is particularly pleasing to a woman of 60-something about to be shown on British television as a mean old bat with a mouth like a trap. Not that such a persona is unusual for her. When she's not doing something pure and classical, she's most likely to emerge on film or television as somebody unappetisingly post-menopausal who's just done something particularly unlovely with a kirby grip. What appealed to her about Reza's two- hander was its sexiness: a middle-aged romance defined by the experiences of the hearts and minds of the protagonists, unhindered by the mendacious imperatives of their hormones. Tonight she is in excellent form. Someone asks her about a theatrical anecdote recounted by her hairdresser, apparently, featuring Atkins and luminaries of the British stage. She listens politely, widens her eyes and says, \"Christ, talk about Chinese whispers.\" Her first-hand version tells you all you need to know about the personalities of the actors involved and hinges upon the night, five or so years ago, when the snow-making machine for the stage production of John Gabriel Borkman went on the blink. The stage manager had the task of going into three dressing rooms to inform the three stars of the disaster. There would be no snow in the snow scene. Eileen's response was to lose her rag. \"What's the matter with those bloody fools,\" she raved, \"can't they even do the simplest thing.\" Vanessa Redgrave took it sweetly. \"Oh dear,\" she murmured, \"perhaps we could all tear paper up into little bits and we could throw them up in the air.\" Paul Scofield continued to regard his face in the mirror. Then (and she does a perfect imitation of his growl) \"No snow. No Sco.\" \"No show!\" the table rocks. \" No Sco!\" For the duration of The Unexpected Man, Miss Atkins is residing in a small apartment in a hotel described by an Irish poet friend of hers as like living inside your Auntie Hilda's knickers. You can see what he meant. Her quarters are quaintly film-starry, all pink and chintzy-frilly, not at all like her. All available flat surfaces are covered with books about or by Virginia Woolf, first-night gifts from friends and well-wishers. She doesn't know what made them think she hadn't already read them all, but it was nice of them, wasn't it? Against the incongruous, rented background, her straight-up-and-down, black- and-white figure reminds you that there are aesthetic rules for correct bodily proportion to which we must all aspire, and that these are probably what you're looking at. Being herself, without a fictive motivation inside her bones, she moves fluidly, like a dancer. Like all pathologically impatient people, she can't be bothered to prevaricate. Her back is precisely as broad as her front, and you get to see them both at the same time. She's not always easy, her husband, producer Bill Shepherd, told me while imparting her whereabouts: \"One of the things I love about Eileen is she hasn't the faintest idea how good she is.\" And she hasn't. She just gets on with it. Does what she has to. A cursory glance at the record of her long career tells the story of her driving force in no uncertain terms - she has never allowed herself to be involved in anything vaguely resembling mediocrity. It's as though she suddenly popped up from obscurity as Jaquenetta in Love's Labour's Lost at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, and then spent the rest of her life swanning around the orchard of all that is great and good, picking one plum role after another like a scrumper with an in-built shit detector. Her co-stars seem invariably to have been lions such as Laurence Olivier or Alec Guinness, and she doesn't seem to have ever bothered to open a script unless it emanated from Shakespeare or Shaw or, at a pinch, Eliot, Tennessee Williams, DH Lawrence, Edward Albee, Robert Bolt or John Osborne. In the parallel universe of her writing career, she has rarely stooped beneath the rarefied aura of Virginia Woolf and her chums. Why bother? She routinely collected posh awards for whatever she involved herself in, here and in America over the past 35 years, culminating, in 1998, when she was rather pleased to get the Olivier award for The Unexpected Man, swiftly followed by the Evening Standard gong for best screenwriter with her screenplay for Mrs Dalloway. When she gets a minute, she'll complete the film script of her play Vita And Virginia - well, just tart it up a bit, it's more or less done - and think about what to do next. On this muggy morning in Manhattan, she feels she must address herself to more personal biographic matters, which she hasn't ever really got down to in a serious way before. She's not sure she's telling the truth, though, because she's not sure what the truth really is. Memory is a movable feast, we rewrite the past as we go along and, besides, whatever she says about her origins will be hotly disputed by Ron, her surviving sibling. However, as the child of elderly parents - always assuming her desire to be exposed as a changeling continues to be thwarted - she feels entitled to trace her direct blood line back to the 19th century and the photographic image of her maternal grandfather, \"the only gorgeous member of the family\". Dark, dark brown eyes, black hair, excitingly foreign, she'd pore over the portrait and ask her mother, was he Italian? Spanish? And her mother would hush her up, no, no, no, don't be so silly, as though the mere thought of being anything other than entirely English, with perhaps a bit of Scottish on dad's side, was somehow shameful, something not quite right in the woodshed. Her mum was intent on bettering herself, not dwelling on dubieties of ancestry. She was knocking 40 when she met Eileen's dad, and, according to family lore, obliged him to marry her in exchange for taking care of his three-year-old daughter while he serviced the automobile of the Portuguese ambassador. He was called an under-chauffeur, which meant that, though he couldn't actually drive a car - he didn't know how - he got to vacuum them and polish their bonnets. When his first wife died, he took up lodging in Eileen's mum's mother's house in Stoke Newington, where they all lived together in quiet desperation and increasingly cramped conditions as the children of the union arrived at a rate of one a year. When she was pregnant for the third time, she opted for an abortion in the interests of health, space and respectability. Then, when her two-year-old died of diphtheria, she realised God had punished her for her wickedness. Life went on in the little house; dad read gas meters, mum sewed for a factory all day and went out at night to be a barmaid in the Elephant &amp; Castle. And that was it until, at the age of 47, she discovered she was pregnant again. \"It's funny,\" Eileen says, \"but I always felt I've come out of a massive row.\" She sounds enigmatic, but it's probably literally true. Her father, it seems, had undergone testicular surgery, a painful and emotionally unmanning experience that prompted a somewhat taunting comment from his good lady. \"I'll show you . . .\" he is supposed to have retaliated and, wallop, Eileen was conceived. She was born in the Salvation Army Home in Clapton, north London, a geographic fact furiously denied by her mother, who insisted until the day she died that it was a hospital, not a home. They were allotted a council house in Tottenham as a prize for the birth of Eileen June. They'd never had it so good. The six of them piled into the two-down, three-up; gran, mum, dad, half-sister, brother and the tiny blonde princess, God's forgiving gift. \"My very first memory of being alive,\" she says 66 years after the event and bright as yesterday, \"is being tossed in the air by my father and laughing and knowing, really knowing, that his was absolute joy.\" She knew that, and she knew that she was unequivocally adored. There was never, ever any doubt about it. She could tell her siblings were miffed, and she knew, even then, she couldn't blame them for that. She was a born dotee and, in the Jesuitical sense, she reciprocated the dote till the age of seven, when she ceased to be pretty and realised she could read and didn't need her dad to tell her his wonderful stories any more. Not to mince words, her dad was a bit on the backward side. He left school, of necessity, at the age of 12 and was known by the children of his acquaintance as \"Uncle Funny Man\" for his amiable, childlike qualities. To Eileen, as she began to look about herself with the critical eye of a seven-year-old, he was just stupid. Irritatingly so. For instance, when they built the first motorway, the M1, he would always pronounce it the M Eye. It made her wince. So she said to him, listen dad, it's not the M Eye. It's the M One. Next time they build a motorway, it'll be the M Two, then the M Three. \"That's right, luv,\" he said cheerfully, \"M Eye.\" She remembers the day she read her first words as one of the greatest moments of her life. She knows exactly where she was in the high street, holding her father's hand, looking at an advertising hoarding with a poster of a man with yellow hair riding a bicycle on top of a jar of Bovril. And the words, \"Bovril is good for you.\" She read them out loud. Oh Bliss. \"Bovril is good for you.\" She didn't feel her father's deflation until they got home and she heard him say to her mother, \"She can read\", in the same tone he'd have used if he'd said, \"I lost her\", or, \"Her leg came off\". From then on books were her ecstasy. Even now, when that unaccountable flooding of euphoria, bliss, happiness, whatever you call it, wafts across her consciousness - you know how it does sometimes, for no particular reason - she gets a flash of the steps leading up to the library in Tottenham, just round the corner from the council house. Her father didn't tune himself easily to the separation caused by his daughter's literacy. Whatever sadness he felt he channelled into a threatening irascibility over the possibility of a ha'penny fine being imposed on her overdue library books. He'd pick them up, sigh, then glare at the date stamps. Stupid, stupid man. Only when she was nearing middle age did she appreciate she was just like him. Thick. She has the same kind of intransigent thickness as the one she despised as a child. She prepares for her roles slowly. S-L-O-W-L-Y and with difficulty. She finds herself at parties with erudite friends, suddenly unable to understand a word anyone's saying, as though something tripped in her brain and she's fallen down a black hole. Once she had a lover who asked her to nip out and move his car. When she told him she couldn't drive, he turned on her. You idiot. He bawled. You incompetent. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I act and I fuck and that's it.\" Her mum was the pushy one. Sometimes now, when she looks down at her own hands, she sees her mother's. She's like her, too. When Eileen was three, a Gypsy came to the door selling lucky heather and clothes pegs. Not getting much change out of Eileen's mum, she gazed at the little girl clinging to her skirts and announced she was to be a world famous dancer. Never one to pass an opportunity, Eileen's mum went straight out and enrolled her in the nearest dance class. She tended to make the best of things, did Eileen's mum. From the age of three, Eileen has been insomniac. Her mum dragged her around doctors' surgeries, distraught for two years, until an old Indian physician explained the problem. \"She has,\" he said, \"too much imagination.\" He prescribed, for reasons best known to himself, breakfast in bed and lots of books. Mother and daughter were well satisfied with the arrangement. Eileen's mum would say, airily, \"Oh no, she never sleeps. She has too much imagination.\" As though vaunting another facet of her own and her daughter's innate superiority. Eileen didn't like dancing class. At the same time, she discovered in herself an aptitude for inventing, telling and maintaining monstrous lies. That and snivelling. While her mother persevered with the famous dancer fantasy, enrolling her in school after school, Eileen invented her own exit lines. \"They're awful to me,\" she'd come home blubbing. \"That Doreen, she put my head down the toilet and pulled the chain.\" She doesn't know to this day where she got it from, or how she held on to her story while the innocent Doreen was pilloried and exiled to outer darkness. \"I was just . . .\" she says, \"a liar.\" In 1939, and for some time after, the exigencies of the war threw up a moral climate among Londoners in which it was considered the height of adult responsibility for parents to evacuate their children to rural locations, where strangers were prevailed upon to take them into their homes, while they remained in the prime bombing area to contribute to the war effort. In deference to this masterstroke of social engineering, Eileen, aged five, was given a bar of chocolate and put on a bus with her 12-year-old brother and innumerable other brats, and transported to a village called Little Baddow in Essex, or, if her brother's recollection is more accurate, Great Baddow. There, in company with some Civil Defence dignitary, the children were trailed from house to house, imploring the residents to take them in. \"Aw, please take us, lady, we're ever so clean,\" she heard her brother beseech a woman at her garden gate, which was bad enough. Then a huge, unpleasant-looking woman arrived, demanded the pretty one with the ringlets and whisked Eileen home to her daughter, who kicked her, pinched her and scoffed her chocolate. Endlessly weeping was again the answer to her problem. She sobbed, she cried, she damned near died, for many months. Then her mother came and took her back to London, omitting to register her as a resident and therefore a schoolchild. She stayed at home with mum, who, to distract her traumatised daughter from the air raids and bomb devastation, redoubled her efforts to give the Gypsy's prediction a helping hand. Tirelessly she sewed the little nymphet costumes. Ruthlessly she hawked the child, now known as \"Baby Eileen\", around the working men's club circuit, where she tappy-toed and sang faintly iffy songs for 15 shillings a pop. Of course, she knew there was something deeply wrong with being Baby Eileen (see picture, page 41). The whole frilly-knickered-bum-chuck, finger-to-dimple awfulness of it all. She once heard a big bosomed chanteuse complain to the management, \"Hey, Buster, how am I meant to compete with that ?\" cocking a thumb in her direction. But 15 bob was a lot of money in those days, and besides, it's not everyone who can boast they were on the same bill as Anna Neagle, at age seven, singing I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy and toe-tapping on a drum at the stage door canteen. In the golden autumn of her elegantly fulfilled life, Miss Atkins has no particular complaint about the bizarre nature of her childhood. \"Bad things happen,\" she says imperiously. \"Cope!\" What really pisses her off is the current vogue for \"counselling\". The slightest thing happens, you witness an accident, you get burgled, some fool sends you a victim support round robin and the offer of \"counselling\". She sounds, she concedes, like some fat old blimp. \"I was thrashed with the buckle end of a belt and it never did me any harm.\" Yes, that's her. A disgustingly reactionary old woman. \"Wheels come off? Get on with it. Cope. Survive.\" She isn't joking. Pragmatic people don't jest about themselves; rather, they sometimes choose to elaborate on one half of a contradiction for reasons of economy or modesty. The fact that life hurts is a banality, and we're all free to choose to be anaesthetised or sensitised or, as Eileen puts it so succinctly, \"You might as well stay indoors for ever, because if you go out the bus conductor might not like you.\" By the time she went to high school, she was bright enough not to give a stuff about being stupid. At the end of a lesson, teachers would say to the class, \"Do you understand?\" then, \"And does Eileen understand?\" and everybody would laugh. She didn't take offence and therefore no offence was intended. School offered \"Drama\", and a drama teacher who allowed her more enthusiastic pupils to improvise and perform their own playlets. Eileen found her niche and stuck to it. In the fourth form she took the title role in the school production of Alice In Wonderland, a triumph that put her occasional scholastic weakness into perspective and gave her an identity she could grow up with. More significantly, perhaps, she found a mentor in the shape of the divinity master, an energetic and singular fellow with a penchant for moulding receptive schoolgirls, who sailed fairly close to the wind by eventually marrying one of them. But his influence on Eileen was purely cerebral, and, in imparting to her the benefits of his mindset, broke down the remaining barriers of her upbringing. They travelled to and from school on the same bus, he took her to the theatre, he explained to her with meticulous care the societal improprieties of capitalism and the moral superiority of socialism. He made her a free thinker. This had the effect of making her perfectly foul to her mum and dad. My, how she knocked and mocked the poor darlings, their narrow-mindedness, the petty parameters of their ambitions for themselves and herself. When she was 14, going on 15, she took it upon herself to address a Mr Robert Atkins, a Royal Shakespeare Company director with an encouragingly familiar name and an on-going production she felt she had something to say about. \"Dear Mr Atkins,\" she wrote. \"The boy who plays the prince in your King John isn't good enough. I could do it better.\" Or words to that effect. He must have been temporarily amused, because he wrote back and suggested she drop in some time. He was less amused when she turned up, having dressed and cosmeticised herself to resemble her idea of a going concern. In fact, he was rather nasty. Good God, he said rudely, we don't want any shop girls here. Flattered, she replied that she wasn't a shop girl, she was a schoolgirl, and threw herself into her little prince speech with no trepidation. After that, he told her to come back when she was a grown-up and she went back to school thinking it had all been rather a good day's work. Eileen didn't get into Rada. Guildhall wasn't keen, either, but signed her up for its teaching course and nobody noticed when she slipped herself in with the drama students and took up their curriculum as well. She wanted to be an actress. She was an actress. At 18, going on 19, she was slogging up and down Charing Cross Road, knocking on doors, looking for jobs. That was how it worked in those days. You put yourself on as many agents' books as there were agents, then you went home and hoped. One Christmas she nearly got a job as a pantomime dog. An agent rang her up and said, quick, tell the truth, how tall are you? Five foot seven, she said. Damn, he said, the costume's for five foot two. Oh, she said, did I say five foot seven, I must have been thinking of my sister, she's the five foot seven one, honest - I'm five foot two. An hour later, she was backstage at some fleapit in Walthamstow with three other contenders. There was no audition, just the skin. So there she was, sweating and straining and yanking at the zip of this ratty costume, her entire life depending on cramming her five foot seven frame into a five foot two dog skin, and failing. No job. No money. No life. Next day brought another great opportunity. A Christmas show in Norwich. \"You'll be met at the station, dearie,\" said the agent. \"It's a three pounds a week, all in. Digs and everything.\" Nothing to lose, everything to gain, she packed her suitcase and boarded a train for Norwich, where she was met at the station by a sad creature with a baby in her arms and a toddler round her ankles who dolefully led her to a bus stop. The bus stopped outside a theatre showing Mother Goose with Cyril Fletcher, and what luck, a young man called Peter Johnson, who she'd been at drama school with. Only it wasn't her stop. The bus sailed on into the countryside and set her and her dismal companions down by a fairground. She was then led through the deepening darkness to a caravan in which a large man, another child and three huge dogs were already ensconced. These, apparently, were her digs. \"Look, lovey,\" said the large man, relieving her of her suitcase and stowing it beyond her reach. \"I know all you girls think you're serious actresses\" - which Eileen thought was perspicacious of him - \"but get a load of this . . .\" and he produced a cardboard box of Turkish harem costumes and flourished it at her in the manner of one offering the answer to a maiden's prayer. \"Go on,\" he said, \"you can choose!\" Her role, it seemed, was to adorn herself in the exotic scanties of her choice, then prance about outside a tent in the cold, exhorting people to buy tickets to watch her host throwing knives at his wife, after which she was welcome to bed down with them in the caravan, babies, dogs, the whole ensemble. And no, there was no telephone and no again, her suitcase was staying put. When in doubt, Eileen reckons, act it out. Certainly, bursting into tears was not going to work this time. So she fingered the horrible costumes in the vile box and said, ooh, yummy, how lovely, she could hardly wait - then, muttering something about finding other digs, ran panic-stricken into the night, leapt aboard a Norwich-bound bus and found herself at the stage door of Mother Goose. \"Mr Johnson,\" she demanded, pulling herself together. \"Mr Peter Johnson.\" Someone bawled along a corridor and Mr Johnson was roused from his kip between matinee and evening shows to emerge in green tights, horns, full Demon King fig, still holding his trident. Even his face was green. He threw his duffle coat over his kit, hailed a cab, bundled Eileen into it, took her back to the fair, thumped on the caravan door and addressed himself to the knife-thrower. \"Evening,\" he barked. \"Sorry. Not suitable. All right? Sorry. Give us the case. Jolly good. Sorry. Thank you. Goodnight.\" Then he drove Eileen to the station and put her on a train back to London. She got home at five in the morning. Her brother Ron let her in. \"Right,\" said Ron, taking one look at her, \"that's it. She's had it. The end.\" But it wasn't. She continued to live at home in Tottenham with her parents and Ron while they gamely supported her in whatever she did as best they could. Her mum and dad sat bored and bewildered through interminable Shakespeares and Ibsens and Chekhovs and, good grief, Strindbergs, while their beloved daughter spread her wings far, far beyond their wildest dreams of her betterment. They'd hoped for a successful chorus girl. They didn't complain. They were, she says, valiant. One day, she thinks she was doing a Strindberg play at the time, she was with her father when they passed a theatre somewhere in Croydon where the late Cicely Courtneidge was starring in an extravaganza called Steppin' High or Steppin' Out or some fine thing. \"Now that's the sort of thing I'd like to see you in,\" her dad said to her. She could have killed him at the time, but now, well, bless. And she wonders if she ever thanked Peter Johnson properly. Six years ago, Eileen was in New York doing a play with Kathleen Turner. The two women didn't get on. Not to put too fine a point on it, they seemed to share a deep and visceral mutual aversion. And then Eileen got cancer. She took her little lump to the doctor and knew immediately what it was because he avoided her eye. She won't hear a word against oncologists. \"Not only do they work impossible hours,\" she says, \"but they're supposed to behave impeccably and be psychiatrists as well.\" Her best friend went with her for the big biopsy report and the best friend burst into tears and everybody looked the other way and, yes, she had cancer and they took her in and cut it out and that was it. Next morning some poor, benighted counsellor came into her room and confided to her that she must be very angry. Angry? asked Eileen. Oh yes, she'd kicked up a fuss because of the noise of the television set next door. Sorry, she said, but how are you supposed to get any sleep with that row going on? No, no, said the counsellor. You must be angry about the cancer. You know, he prompted, you must be thinking, why me? \"Look mate,\" she told him. \"I've been angry all my life. I'm not about to start blaming it on cancer at the age of 61. And I've never thought, 'Why me?' I don't understand 'Why me?' My attitude is: 'Why not me?'\" She took some time off actually to have the cancer, of course. She didn't need to, but she did. They gave her the chemo and the radiation and she lay a bit low, because, to be honest, she didn't want people's eyes sliding off her all over the place. She did some writing, read a bit, ate well and felt perfectly wonderful all the way through. Her hair failed to fall out. She never felt sick. She doesn't know what all the fuss is about. She enjoyed it. She met such marvellous women having chemo. Marvellous. It's nothing to do with being brave, it's about getting on with it. You really have no choice. \"I'll tell you what pisses me off,\" she says, not for the first and I trust not for the last time, \"it's that soppy cow on the Archers, weeping and wailing about her bloody cancer.\" Then she thinks for a minute. Still, she concedes, she is a bit young and she'd better watch what she says about the Archers in case she ends up on it. Come to think of it again, she reckons, she'd rather like that \u0095 Eileen Atkins will appear in The Sleeper on BBC1 at Christmas.",

      "body": "<p>Its success will be for the audience to decide, but a new \"musical farce\" running for five days from next Wednesday at the Tabernacle, in Notting Hill (box office, 020-7565 7800), is at any rate a timely antidote to pretentiousness in the musical theatre. Bon Voyage!, as it is called, has no purpose but to entertain, which was all that the best Broadway and Hollywood musicals of the 20s and 30s aimed to do. From the 40s onwards, the American musical became increasingly ponderous and overblown as it strove for deeper meaning and greater dramatic tension. Perhaps because of the second world war and all the horrors that flowed from it, the tide turned against irrelevance and escapism even on the stage. The world was considered too serious a place for unashamed frivolity. </p> <p>But the time may be right for it again now. I hope so, because I am more than peripherally involved in Bon Voyage! The music and words were written by my son-in-law, Alexander Waugh, and his brother, Nathaniel, sons of my old friend Auberon Waugh and, of course, grandsons of the novelist Evelyn Waugh. They wrote it some years ago to amuse themselves, but then entered it for the Vivian Ellis Award for Best New Musical, which it won in 1996. This, however, did not lead to a staging, and the brothers are now putting it on themselves, hoping that some West End impresario will subsequently take it to the commercial stage. </p> <p>This enterprise, like the play itself, is a bold piece of derring-do, which has already generated the kind of alarums, excursions, tensions, feuds and changes of plan that are associated with most risky theatrical ventures. The outline of the plot of Bon Voyage! is described in a foreword to the published libretto: \"Set in 1735, a Plymouth Gypsy warns passengers not to travel on the world's first luxury cruise. Everyone ignores her except the ship's second officer, Lieutenant Gossima. Once on board, this scheming, incompetent, terrified, inadequate man inadvertently causes the prophecy to come true.\" </p> <p>The show is described as \"a vicious black comedy farce, set in the early 18th century - a play with a spinning plot, a panoply of vivid Hogarthian characters, and abundance of music and dance, a passionate love affair and an unexpected mixture of twists, jokes and minor tragedies\". But the authors point out that, \"for this play to succeed, all of the actors must believe in the sincerity of their roles. If the cast is peopled with archetypes and caricatures, never mind. They must be played straight. Any inclination towards Savoyard camp or any attempt to pitch for cheap laughs will meet with certain failure.\" Let us hope that this advice is followed. </p> <p>Readers may be forgiven for concluding that this column is being used to plug a family enterprise, but is that bad? In my view, one should support any effort to inject some freshness and originality into the predictable entertainment fare at Christmas, especially since \"certain failure\" would also be guaranteed to Bon Voyage! if it were denied publicity and nobody knew it was coming on. </p> <p>I don't know how people get publicity for anything unless they are already famous, or have lots of money to spend. If you are Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, it is a doddle. All they had to do was to have a baby and a swanky wedding, and they actually got paid a couple of million pounds to allow themselves to be photographed and interviewed by OK! magazine.

      "bodyText": "Its success will be for the audience to decide, but a new \"musical farce\" running for five days from next Wednesday at the Tabernacle, in Notting Hill (box office, 020-7565 7800), is at any rate a timely antidote to pretentiousness in the musical theatre. Bon Voyage!, as it is called, has no purpose but to entertain, which was all that the best Broadway and Hollywood musicals of the 20s and 30s aimed to do. From the 40s onwards, the American musical became increasingly ponderous and overblown as it strove for deeper meaning and greater dramatic tension. Perhaps because of the second world war and all the horrors that flowed from it, the tide turned against irrelevance and escapism even on the stage. The world was considered too serious a place for unashamed frivolity. But the time may be right for it again now. I hope so, because I am more than peripherally involved in Bon Voyage! The music and words were written by my son-in-law, Alexander Waugh, and his brother, Nathaniel, sons of my old friend Auberon Waugh and, of course, grandsons of the novelist Evelyn Waugh. They wrote it some years ago to amuse themselves, but then entered it for the Vivian Ellis Award for Best New Musical, which it won in 1996. This, however, did not lead to a staging, and the brothers are now putting it on themselves, hoping that some West End impresario will subsequently take it to the commercial stage. This enterprise, like the play itself, is a bold piece of derring-do, which has already generated the kind of alarums, excursions, tensions, feuds and changes of plan that are associated with most risky theatrical ventures. The outline of the plot of Bon Voyage! is described in a foreword to the published libretto: \"Set in 1735, a Plymouth Gypsy warns passengers not to travel on the world's first luxury cruise. Everyone ignores her except the ship's second officer, Lieutenant Gossima. Once on board, this scheming, incompetent, terrified, inadequate man inadvertently causes the prophecy to come true.\" The show is described as \"a vicious black comedy farce, set in the early 18th century - a play with a spinning plot, a panoply of vivid Hogarthian characters, and abundance of music and dance, a passionate love affair and an unexpected mixture of twists, jokes and minor tragedies\". But the authors point out that, \"for this play to succeed, all of the actors must believe in the sincerity of their roles. If the cast is peopled with archetypes and caricatures, never mind. They must be played straight. Any inclination towards Savoyard camp or any attempt to pitch for cheap laughs will meet with certain failure.\" Let us hope that this advice is followed. Readers may be forgiven for concluding that this column is being used to plug a family enterprise, but is that bad? In my view, one should support any effort to inject some freshness and originality into the predictable entertainment fare at Christmas, especially since \"certain failure\" would also be guaranteed to Bon Voyage! if it were denied publicity and nobody knew it was coming on. I don't know how people get publicity for anything unless they are already famous, or have lots of money to spend. If you are Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, it is a doddle. All they had to do was to have a baby and a swanky wedding, and they actually got paid a couple of million pounds to allow themselves to be photographed and interviewed by OK! magazine. It is not even clear to me what they have been trying to promote apart from themselves. They have made a film together, but that has hardly featured in all the guff about marriage and motherhood to which they have subjected us. Beautiful though the new Mrs Douglas may be, I now feel ready to scream if I see another magazine cover of her or of her tense and bewildered-looking husband. She is now on the January cover of Vanity Fair, telling us inside about their pre-nuptial agreement. \"Prenups are brilliant, because it's all sorted out,\" she says. \"Why should Michael be in a position where half of his fortune, which he's worked bloody hard for, lands in someone else's lap?\" Personally, I do not see how a prenuptial agreement is compatible with marriage vows to stay together \"till death do us part\".

      "bodyText": "Israeli tanks fired on a Palestinian police post, and Jewish motorists were sprayed with gunfire as one of the bloodiest days in 10 weeks of Middle East violence left 10 people dead yesterday. Thirteen years after Palestinian anger at Israel's occupation exploded in the first intifada, the first of two days of protests to mark the 1987 uprising brought a sharp escalation in violence yesterday. The day began and ended with drive-by shootings by Palestinian gunmen, intensifying the battle for control of the roads in the West Bank. Three Israelis were killed in two separate attacks. Yesterday also saw Palestinians returning to the stone-throwing protests which have been waning since the first weeks of this intifada. Seven Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces across the West Bank and in Jerusalem, where protesters burned tyres and stoned riot police on the Via Dolorosa, in the fiercest clashes in the holy city for two months. In the bloodiest single incident of the day, Israeli tanks launched three shells at a Palestinian police post in the West Bank city of Jenin, killing three uniformed officers and a civilian passerby. Zuheir Manasra, the governor of Jenin, said the Israelis had opened fire without provocation on an area under the control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. An Israeli military spokeswoman said the post was in an area under Israeli control, but admitted the soldiers had fired first. \"It is a place where a lot of Palestinian people opened fire on our soldiers,\" she said. \"It was very dangerous.\" Outside the Jewish settle ment of Kiryat Arba yesterday morning, gunmen sprayed a white Israeli van with bullets, killing a school teacher, before fleeing to a village under Palestinian control. The van driver died later in the day. A second Israeli car was targeted after dark outside a Jewish settlement near Jericho, killing a soldier. During the last four weeks, Palestinian drive-by shootings have exacted an increasingly heavy toll on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza, and driven some Israelis from their homes in the isolated Jewish outposts. Israeli intelligence officials warned this week that the Palestinian gunmen were perfecting their methods, turning the roads built with the intention of protecting Jewish settlers into killing zones. Yesterday's killings increased the pressure on Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, to strike back against Palestinian gunmen, and extinguished hopes that a relative lull in violence could take hold. Nearly 310 people have been killed in the uprising, which exploded with far greater savagery than the original intifada. Those protests, which lasted until 1993, pushed Israel to enter negotiations with Mr Arafat aimed at creating a Palestinian state. But after yesterday's violence, and the prospects of reprisal attacks today as Israelis and Palestinians bury their dead, hopes of re-opening negotiations seemed all but lost. As news of the van shooting spread yesterday morning, angry settlers roamed the streets of nearby Hebron with assault rifles, calling for revenge. Mourners from the funeral procession of the slain teacher clashed with riot police and leftwing peace activists out side Mr Barak's residence in Jerusalem. 2Inside the ramparts of Jerusalem's old city, meanwhile, afternoon prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque on the second Friday of Ramadan saw hun dreds of protesters fan out along the Via Dolorosa, breaking up chunks of rubble before hurling them at police. As young men with their heads covered with scarves prowled the ramparts of the mosque, raising the Palestinian flag, one group broke away to attack the gates of a police station at Lion's Gate with a steel battering ram. Once inside, they set it alight, for the second time in two months. Among the 10 who died yesterday was a teenager killed when riot police fired rubber bullets; a boy, 16, shot by Israeli troops in Bethlehem; and another Palestinian, 15, declared clinically dead in Hebron.

      "body": "<p>In the week when this newspaper has been calling for a referendum on the monarchy, the proud republic which tore itself free of the British crown has been offering a lesson in the drawbacks of inherited power.</p> <p>The biggest problem facing the likely president, George W Bush, is the perceived illegitimacy of his hold on the White House throne. Bush's shaky mandate is partly due to the closeness of the vote and the legal wrangling afterwards.</p> <p>Yet his claim to run America was undermined long before the state of Florida was twinned with Chad by a central and very English illegitimacy. He is a monarchic president. At the exact moment when the British might be seriously questioning the rule of primogeniture, America is handing down power from father to son. Arise, King George.</p> <p>Most of the reasons that this second Bush presidency appears either sinister or ridiculous result from its dynastic stucture. The essential problem with monarchy is that it puts power at the mercy of relatives and genetics. And this is precisely what hobbles the putative new Bush administration.</p> <p>Let's begin with the question of Jeb. There's an honourable tradition of presidents being worried by their brothers. Jimmy Carter was often distracted from national security matters by concern over what the maverick Billy might say next. Roger Clinton's troubled and druggy past was one of the holes in which the Republicans tried to dig dirt on Bill. But these sibling difficulties are minor beside the difficulties opened up for George W Bush by his little bro.</p> <p>Winning the presidency by a negligible and heavily doubted margin would be enough humiliation for any politician. But God reserved an even harsher joke for the governor of Texas. His victory-is-it? would be sealed by the results of a state run by his brother, who would be required to sign the legislation awarding the votes to him.</p> <p>His public comments during the vote-tie crisis show no sign that Governor Jeb Bush of Florida understands the extent to which his brother is, in a reversal of the usual process, rendered illegitimate by family ties.</p> <p>\"I did everything I could to help my brother win,\" he admitted early on. More recently, to suggestions that he might recuse himself from the duty of signing Florida's election results into law, he insisted that he could not \"recuse myself from my family\".</p> <p>Republicans spent eight years trying to prove that President Clinton had blood on his hands. The problem for President George W Bush is the blood in his veins. One of the major arguments for a republic - that you can't become head of state just because of being someone's relative - is being proved again in a nation founded on that doubt.</p> <p>The defence of the Bush family, as it was for the Kennedys, is that their dynasties are elective. But government through bloodline is vulnerable to the same objections whether it occurs through voting or the passing down of a crown. This becomes even more apparent in the shape of King George II's main family problem - his dad, King George I. Already weakened by the perception that his brother got him the job, King George II seems determined to restore his father's court in Washington.</p> <p>Putative cabinet appointments spun to the press as fresh and radical - General Colin Powell as the first black secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice as the first black national security advisor - are impaired by the fact that these candidates first served the king his father in other roles. His vice president, Dick Cheney, is another retread courtier. It's always said that Dubya is too dumb to read books but he seems to have studied English history with dangerous avidity.</p> <p>Another case against the inheritance of power is the kick hidden in the DNA: whether haemophilia or stupidity. Again, a Bush administration would illustrate this risk. His father's reign was that of a borderline dimwit whose mental wiring left him unable to speak the English language with conviction or precision. Precisely these design faults occur in King George II, with the additional hindrances of alcoholism (under control) and, unlike his father, extreme laziness.</p> <p>This presidency would perfectly prove Philip Larkin's lines about the influence of parents on children: \"They give you all the faults they had /And add some extra, just for you.\" In fact, the decision of half of the electorate to vote for George W Bush is perhaps best understood as a genetic experiment. In an age obsessed with DNA and inheritance, the voters decided to see what would happen if they sent a son into a situation recently occupied by his father.</p> <p>But the result of the experiment will almost certainly be disastrous and I urge Americans to consider the merits of Republicanism.

      "bodyText": "In the week when this newspaper has been calling for a referendum on the monarchy, the proud republic which tore itself free of the British crown has been offering a lesson in the drawbacks of inherited power. The biggest problem facing the likely president, George W Bush, is the perceived illegitimacy of his hold on the White House throne. Bush's shaky mandate is partly due to the closeness of the vote and the legal wrangling afterwards. Yet his claim to run America was undermined long before the state of Florida was twinned with Chad by a central and very English illegitimacy. He is a monarchic president. At the exact moment when the British might be seriously questioning the rule of primogeniture, America is handing down power from father to son. Arise, King George. Most of the reasons that this second Bush presidency appears either sinister or ridiculous result from its dynastic stucture. The essential problem with monarchy is that it puts power at the mercy of relatives and genetics. And this is precisely what hobbles the putative new Bush administration. Let's begin with the question of Jeb. There's an honourable tradition of presidents being worried by their brothers. Jimmy Carter was often distracted from national security matters by concern over what the maverick Billy might say next. Roger Clinton's troubled and druggy past was one of the holes in which the Republicans tried to dig dirt on Bill. But these sibling difficulties are minor beside the difficulties opened up for George W Bush by his little bro. Winning the presidency by a negligible and heavily doubted margin would be enough humiliation for any politician. But God reserved an even harsher joke for the governor of Texas. His victory-is-it? would be sealed by the results of a state run by his brother, who would be required to sign the legislation awarding the votes to him. His public comments during the vote-tie crisis show no sign that Governor Jeb Bush of Florida understands the extent to which his brother is, in a reversal of the usual process, rendered illegitimate by family ties. \"I did everything I could to help my brother win,\" he admitted early on. More recently, to suggestions that he might recuse himself from the duty of signing Florida's election results into law, he insisted that he could not \"recuse myself from my family\". Republicans spent eight years trying to prove that President Clinton had blood on his hands. The problem for President George W Bush is the blood in his veins. One of the major arguments for a republic - that you can't become head of state just because of being someone's relative - is being proved again in a nation founded on that doubt. The defence of the Bush family, as it was for the Kennedys, is that their dynasties are elective. But government through bloodline is vulnerable to the same objections whether it occurs through voting or the passing down of a crown. This becomes even more apparent in the shape of King George II's main family problem - his dad, King George I. Already weakened by the perception that his brother got him the job, King George II seems determined to restore his father's court in Washington. Putative cabinet appointments spun to the press as fresh and radical - General Colin Powell as the first black secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice as the first black national security advisor - are impaired by the fact that these candidates first served the king his father in other roles. His vice president, Dick Cheney, is another retread courtier. It's always said that Dubya is too dumb to read books but he seems to have studied English history with dangerous avidity. Another case against the inheritance of power is the kick hidden in the DNA: whether haemophilia or stupidity. Again, a Bush administration would illustrate this risk. His father's reign was that of a borderline dimwit whose mental wiring left him unable to speak the English language with conviction or precision. Precisely these design faults occur in King George II, with the additional hindrances of alcoholism (under control) and, unlike his father, extreme laziness. This presidency would perfectly prove Philip Larkin's lines about the influence of parents on children: \"They give you all the faults they had /And add some extra, just for you.\" In fact, the decision of half of the electorate to vote for George W Bush is perhaps best understood as a genetic experiment. In an age obsessed with DNA and inheritance, the voters decided to see what would happen if they sent a son into a situation recently occupied by his father. But the result of the experiment will almost certainly be disastrous and I urge Americans to consider the merits of Republicanism. By coincidence, a revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Merrily We Roll Along opens in London on Monday. It includes a satirical song at the Washington court of the Kennedys, in which the paternal kingmaker sings: \"One day, elections will be unknown/As each of our kids will ascend the throne.\" Written as a joke about America's past, it now sounds like a gag about the nation's future.

At the inquest, forensic psychologist Henrietta Bullard said that she was possibly suffering from schizophrenia.</p> <p>Her family reported her missing, but she was taken off the police register when, in May, she was found living in her car at Loe Bar, an isolated stretch of coastline in Cornwall. In June, Sunita visited her there and said she seemed happy, if a little manic, and by July she had moved on again, this time to Truro.</p> <p>\"I had three meetings with Davina,\" said the Very Reverend Michael Moxon, dean of Truro cathedral. One weekday, early in July, Davina had slipped into the 19th century cathedral by its west door and hovered through evensong until Rev Moxon came over and spoke to her. \"She was a strikingly good-looking lady of Indian background, which stands out around here,\" he said. \"I asked 'are you down here on holiday?' because she was well turned out, highly articulate and gave no appearance of sleeping rough. I guessed there was some inner turmoil, however. She was willing to talk about some things, but then would go quite quiet.\" Davina intimated to him that she was in Cornwall because she found it peaceful. In this setting, Rev Moxon gathered, she would try to \"recover\" before returning to her old life.</p> <p>The following Sunday, she went back to see him. \"She seemed a bit more upset this time. We sat there for an hour, long after everyone had left the refectory, and she found it very difficult to talk. She would start saying something and then would go quiet. For much of the hour, we sat in silence. I couldn't find out where she was staying because she was evasive.\"</p> <p>The third time he saw her, Davina seemed very upset. The Rev Moxon wrote his name - Michael - on a piece of paper, and gave her his telephone number.</p> <p>On July 25 the family reported her missing for the second time.</p> <p>In the Gorran Haven car park, it took a few days for Davina's red car to be singled out from the high season bustle. The village, a picturesque fishing resort arranged around a sandy cove, is 11 miles from St Austell and part of what locals describe as the Cornish Riviera. As you enter it, there is a large National Trust car park on the left hand side.</p> <p>When Davina pulled in and failed to get out of her car, villagers assumed she was sleeping off a long journey. When she had not moved after several days, they grew concerned. Donald Gray, then coastal warden for the National Trust, said: \"Originally she told us she was just staying in the car park because she was travelling round on holiday, but it became noticeable that the car was just not moving - the grass was growing up all under it.\"</p> <p>Edward Savage and his wife Trudi live in the house nearest the car park. \"In the early days, she was seen down in the village,\" said Mr Savage. \"She seemed reasonably normal. She wasn't in some drug haze, or injured or obviously ill. She used to walk down the road to use the public toilets. It was difficult to communicate with her, because she would have her head down, and if you said hello, she didn't look up.\"</p> <p>\"She used to go into the disabled loo and wash out her smalls,\" said Joan Gandy, a retired villager. \"Her situation struck me as wrong, right away. Every time I saw her in the car, she was asleep. I thought, you don't sleep all day and all night. I tried to talk to her, but she didn't want to know.\"</p> <p>Waiving National Trust regulations, Mr Gray did not attempt to remove Davina. But as her stay seeped from days into weeks, both Mr Gray and his wife called the police. Trudi Savage also reported Davina's presence to the police twice. It was heard at her inquest that an officer came out to the vehicle, but did not feel able to detain Davina under the Mental Health Act. Davina's family were not informed of her whereabouts, the inquest heard, because checks run on the police national computer looked only at her car details and not at her name.</p> <p>About a month into her stay, after being rebuffed several times in the street, Mr Savage tentatively approached the car.</p> <p>\"She startled when I got to the window. She was dozing in the back seat, which she did quite a lot. She had the window shut, even though it was a very hot day, so I got myself down to her level and said, 'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Are you ok?' Her eyes welled with tears. She said 'yes'. I said, 'are you sure?' and she said, 'yes, I'm all right'. And I said, we're concerned about you and she shook her head and looked away. I said, if there's anything we can do we're just down the road. She nodded and that was it.\"</p> <p>Two days before she died, Mrs Gandy saw her walking up the hill. \"She looked terribly tired and dejected,\" she said. \"But she didn't look emaciated enough to cause real alarm.\"</p> <p>It was Edward Savage who found Davina dead. \"She was sprawled on her front, spread out. It didn't look like she'd collapsed in a heap. It was as if she had just laid down to die.\"</p> <p><b> Tragic</b><br> \"If we'd known what a tragic end it was going to have, we might have done something more,\" said Mr Savage. \"We got used to seeing her there. The National Trust used to send a bloke round to cut the grass that summer, and he just cut around the car. When the car was towed away, the grass was so long ...\"</p> <p>Sunita Rappai and her family lodged a complaint against the Devon and Cornwall police. \"There is an argument for neglect,\" Sunita said at the inquest. \"They failed to recognise she was a vulnerable person and failed... to protect her.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't know her well,\" the Rev Moxon said, \"but I often think of her. You wonder how this young, beautiful, vibrant woman, who had the church, the police and her family at her disposal, could none the less have been lost. Should I have followed her out of the cathedral? Should I have gone to where her car was? Knowing what I know now, I could have taken more steps to help. But to what extent do you leave people to their humanity? To what extent do you let them make their own choice?\"</p>",

But to what extent do you leave people to their humanity? To what extent do you let them make their own choice?\"",

One bereaved mother described Paul Knapman as \"no less than a butcher\" after hearing how a victim's severed hands were lost in a mortuary freezer for four years. The apology issued by Dr Knapman during the public inquiry into the identification of victims was \"too little too late,\" the relatives said. Some broke down in tears and others jeered as Dr Knapman, coroner of inner west London, said he had been unaware of the outrage caused by his decision to allow hands from about 20 of the 51 victims to be cut off to help with fingerprint identification. It emerged on Thursday that the hands of Elsa Garcia, a 25-year-old London University language student, were discovered by accident wrapped in a bin bag by a mortuary staff member who was cleaning out a freezer four years after the August 1989 accident. The hands were never returned to the family as Dr Knapman ordered them to be disposed of, feeling that it was better to shelter relatives from the gruesome detail of post mortem procedures.

Within days of the disaster, in which the Marchioness was in collision with the dredger Bowbelle on the Thames in central London, Dr Knapman went on holiday without leaving clear instructions for his deputy that hand severing was a last resort option, the inquiry heard. Angela Bensamenn, of Auckland, New Zealand, whose 22-year-old son Dean Palmer was killed, heckled Dr Knapman as he gave evidence.

      "body": "<p><strong> January 7 2000. Los Angeles </strong> </p> <p>In pursuit of Brecht, who lived for five years in perpetual summer in Santa Monica, in a street that could comfortably pass for Weybridge. We drive through downtown LA to get a view over the city from Mulholland Drive, from where, as they say, you could see the sea if you could see the sea. On to Sunset Boulevard, where we stop outside outside a petshop called Hound Heaven, opposite the Hollywood gothic Chateau Marmont, to do a piece to camera beneath a giant Marlboro Man. \"Smoking Causes Impotence\" reads the legend beneath the cut-out. Marlboro Man's cigarette displays a glorious irony: his cigarette has brewer's droop. </p> <p>We film at the house where I'm staying, which belongs to my friend Gordon Davidson, the director of the Mark Taper Forum - a thriving LA theatre. The house used to belong to the Viennese-born actress and writer, Salka Viertel, and is haunted by Garbo (Viertel's lover), Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Schoenberg, Eisler, Brecht and Christopher Isherwood - in whose old room, in the converted garage, I am staying, as Christopher Hampton did many years ago when he wrote Tales from Hollywood. LA had such a lure for exiles from Europe; a place with no past, where you don't have to start over by acquiring another culture - you carry it with you. </p> <p>Brecht worked in this house on a screenplay with Salka Viertel. They agreed to play by Hollywood rules: no art, all compromise. The story involved a woman collaborator in the French resistance, whose head was shaved when her treachery was revealed. The film remained unmade: Viertel failed to convince Brecht that no movie star would agree to appear with a shaven head throughout the film. These days they would be trampled in the rush. </p> <p>I meet actor and producer, Norman Lloyd, who co- produced and acted in Brecht's Galileo with Charles Laughton, after many had rejected it (including Elia Kazan). Brecht asked Norman to persuade Charles Laughton to stop the latter from absent-mindedly playing with himself under his robes; Helene Weigel solved the problem by sewing his pockets up. </p> <p><strong> January 11</strong> </p> <p>Back in London outside the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, talking about the way that playhouses expanded and spectacle replaced dialogue. The theatre that preceded the present one was owned by Sheridan and it burned down. He watched the fire from a nearby pub and wryly observed: \"A man may surely take a glass of wine by his own fireside.\" This drollery has been taken to heart by a pair of cider and meths drinkers, who shelter in an alcove in the side of the theatre. I have to do several takes; each time I pass them by, they mutter feelingly: \"Prick . . .\" Which is the word that I apply to myself later that day as I stand on the revolve of Les Mis\u00e9rables, talking about mega-musicals. </p> <p>I round off the day with another piece to camera in the subway leading from the new Imax cinema to the National Theatre. It has displaced Cardboard City, and now houses only one young man, made doubly homeless, who half-heartedly tries to extract a toll from passers-by. When I give him some money, he thanks me and says I must have been homeless once. \"No,\" I say, \"just lucky\", thinking of Lear's discovery of \"houseless poverty\". The subway glitters with a Milky Way of small, sparkling blue lights; commuters brush by the film unit, entirely uninterested, and my memory keeps failing like a stuttering carburettor. </p> <p><strong> January 17. Quebec</strong> </p> <p>\"Snow is its own country,\" says the poet, Douglas Dunn, which helps to explain the foreignness of the city of Quebec - closer to New York than Toronto, but looking and feeling like a French provincial city. We're here to film Robert Lepage and his theatre. </p> <p>I find it hard to be pessimistic about the theatre when it harbours such a singular talent as Robert. He was born here, where his father was a bilingual taxi driver, from whom he unquestionably inherited his passion and facility for storytelling. It is bitingly cold, less than -40C (-40F) even with the sun out. My grandfather was a polar explorer so I ought to be genetically conditioned to take this in my stride. He remarked laconically in his journals: \"Minus 21C (-6F). Pretty cold, I'd say.\" He would have scorned my feebleness: I feel as if I've been locked in a meat freezer, throat dry with cold, lungs catching on frozen breath. </p> <p>We film on the ferry that crosses the St Lawrence river. The viscous glass-green water eddies violently as we cut through the ice floes, skirting huge crystal slabs like giant mouthfuls of broken teeth, garlanded with wispy freezing vapour floating over the river like ectoplasm. </p> <p>Robert talks about his new one-man show, The Dark Side of the Moon, which is about the Russian space project, the moon's phases, and his own childhood. All his shows make connections between subjects and cultures and people and different media. Here, in his own theatrical laboratory - a converted fire station - balanced between insularity and internationalism, he devises his shows with his collaborators. His optimism about the future of theatre is unswerving: \"I think that the theatre will still continue to be the mother art, and with time will be enriched by so many aesthetic, technical and ideological revolutions that it will be even richer and even more alive and even more ephemeral.\" In his hands, I believe it. </p> <p><strong> January 18</strong> </p> <p>After lunch in a local caf\u00e9, where we discover that Pat\u00e9 Chinois is Qu\u00e9becois for shepherd's pie made with Smash, corned beef, carrots and sweetcorn, we have a treat: dog sledging. The dogs - wolves in dogs' bodies - live in a gulag, chained to trees in a barbed-wire compound.

      "bodyText": "January 7 2000. Los Angeles In pursuit of Brecht, who lived for five years in perpetual summer in Santa Monica, in a street that could comfortably pass for Weybridge. We drive through downtown LA to get a view over the city from Mulholland Drive, from where, as they say, you could see the sea if you could see the sea. On to Sunset Boulevard, where we stop outside outside a petshop called Hound Heaven, opposite the Hollywood gothic Chateau Marmont, to do a piece to camera beneath a giant Marlboro Man. \"Smoking Causes Impotence\" reads the legend beneath the cut-out. Marlboro Man's cigarette displays a glorious irony: his cigarette has brewer's droop. We film at the house where I'm staying, which belongs to my friend Gordon Davidson, the director of the Mark Taper Forum - a thriving LA theatre. The house used to belong to the Viennese-born actress and writer, Salka Viertel, and is haunted by Garbo (Viertel's lover), Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Schoenberg, Eisler, Brecht and Christopher Isherwood - in whose old room, in the converted garage, I am staying, as Christopher Hampton did many years ago when he wrote Tales from Hollywood. LA had such a lure for exiles from Europe; a place with no past, where you don't have to start over by acquiring another culture - you carry it with you. Brecht worked in this house on a screenplay with Salka Viertel. They agreed to play by Hollywood rules: no art, all compromise. The story involved a woman collaborator in the French resistance, whose head was shaved when her treachery was revealed. The film remained unmade: Viertel failed to convince Brecht that no movie star would agree to appear with a shaven head throughout the film. These days they would be trampled in the rush. I meet actor and producer, Norman Lloyd, who co- produced and acted in Brecht's Galileo with Charles Laughton, after many had rejected it (including Elia Kazan). Brecht asked Norman to persuade Charles Laughton to stop the latter from absent-mindedly playing with himself under his robes; Helene Weigel solved the problem by sewing his pockets up. January 11 Back in London outside the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, talking about the way that playhouses expanded and spectacle replaced dialogue. The theatre that preceded the present one was owned by Sheridan and it burned down. He watched the fire from a nearby pub and wryly observed: \"A man may surely take a glass of wine by his own fireside.\" This drollery has been taken to heart by a pair of cider and meths drinkers, who shelter in an alcove in the side of the theatre. I have to do several takes; each time I pass them by, they mutter feelingly: \"Prick . . .\" Which is the word that I apply to myself later that day as I stand on the revolve of Les Mis\u00e9rables, talking about mega-musicals. I round off the day with another piece to camera in the subway leading from the new Imax cinema to the National Theatre. It has displaced Cardboard City, and now houses only one young man, made doubly homeless, who half-heartedly tries to extract a toll from passers-by. When I give him some money, he thanks me and says I must have been homeless once. \"No,\" I say, \"just lucky\", thinking of Lear's discovery of \"houseless poverty\". The subway glitters with a Milky Way of small, sparkling blue lights; commuters brush by the film unit, entirely uninterested, and my memory keeps failing like a stuttering carburettor. January 17. Quebec \"Snow is its own country,\" says the poet, Douglas Dunn, which helps to explain the foreignness of the city of Quebec - closer to New York than Toronto, but looking and feeling like a French provincial city. We're here to film Robert Lepage and his theatre. I find it hard to be pessimistic about the theatre when it harbours such a singular talent as Robert. He was born here, where his father was a bilingual taxi driver, from whom he unquestionably inherited his passion and facility for storytelling. It is bitingly cold, less than -40C (-40F) even with the sun out. My grandfather was a polar explorer so I ought to be genetically conditioned to take this in my stride. He remarked laconically in his journals: \"Minus 21C (-6F). Pretty cold, I'd say.\" He would have scorned my feebleness: I feel as if I've been locked in a meat freezer, throat dry with cold, lungs catching on frozen breath. We film on the ferry that crosses the St Lawrence river. The viscous glass-green water eddies violently as we cut through the ice floes, skirting huge crystal slabs like giant mouthfuls of broken teeth, garlanded with wispy freezing vapour floating over the river like ectoplasm. Robert talks about his new one-man show, The Dark Side of the Moon, which is about the Russian space project, the moon's phases, and his own childhood. All his shows make connections between subjects and cultures and people and different media. Here, in his own theatrical laboratory - a converted fire station - balanced between insularity and internationalism, he devises his shows with his collaborators. His optimism about the future of theatre is unswerving: \"I think that the theatre will still continue to be the mother art, and with time will be enriched by so many aesthetic, technical and ideological revolutions that it will be even richer and even more alive and even more ephemeral.\" In his hands, I believe it. January 18 After lunch in a local caf\u00e9, where we discover that Pat\u00e9 Chinois is Qu\u00e9becois for shepherd's pie made with Smash, corned beef, carrots and sweetcorn, we have a treat: dog sledging. The dogs - wolves in dogs' bodies - live in a gulag, chained to trees in a barbed-wire compound. My grandfather said that in the Antarctic the baying of the dogs \"touches the lowest depths of sadness in this vast desolation\". These huskies bay at us as if crying for a return to their wolf state, but bark happily at the thought of dragging a man on a sledge. When I get the chance to drive the dog team through the woods, they are silent; the only sound is the hush of the runners and the pad of paws on the ice. January 19 2000. New York They're complaining of the cold again. I scorn it. 27C below (-17F)? You don't know you've lived. Today it's Jason Robards and Peter Shaffer. Robards is a sharp 78.

On one of those occasions Mr Gluck wrote in his column complaining about an increase in the price of the Superplonk wines imposed by Tesco. The price was restored to its lower level. </p> <p>What has never been publicly declared is an arrangement under which the shipper of the wine, not Tesco, pays a \"royalty\" on each bottle, which Mr Gluck has been receiving with the agreement of his immediate section editor at the Guardian. In the beginning this was a small sum. However, the continuing success and growing popularity of the Superplonk wines has seen Mr Gluck's income from the royalty grow to well over \u00a310,000 in the past year. </p> <p>Mr Gluck was wrongly advised by his section editor at the Guardian to accept the royalty in the first place. Although it might be argued that commonsense should have intervened at some point, there was no clearly stated policy or procedure for seeking advice on possibly embarrassing or compromising interests. </p> <p>In recognition of this, the Guardian at my suggestion has agreed to pay Mr Gluck over the next year the precise amount that he would otherwise have received from Tesco's shipper.

      "body": "<p>There is something intimidating about Stephen Sondheim. It's not him. It's his reputation. \"Possibly the greatest lyricist ever,\" says Cameron Mackintosh, who made his first real money in the theatre from the 1976 revue, Side By Side By Sondheim, and who produced the London revival of Follies in 1987. \"For me there is no other,\" enthuses the actress Julia McKenzie, his most brilliant interpreter in Britain. \"But when I meet him, often my syntax breaks down.\" Frank Rich, known as \"The Butcher of Broadway\" during his 14-year tenure as the New York Times theatre critic, and by no means a consistent admirer of Sondheim, wrote \"he has changed the texture of the musical as radically as Oscar Hammerstein, and may yet leave our theatre profoundly altered\". What goes before Sondheim is an extraordinary string of shows, in particular those from the 70s - Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures and Sweeney Todd. </p> <p>In person the promise is of a man whose theatrical analysis of emotion is so forensic, and whose lyrics are so intricate and accurate, that he is not just too clever by half, but by three-quarters. He is also known as a master of the perfectly placed rejoinder. It was Sondheim who, in a dress rehearsal that was running way over time, replied to an exasperated actor demanding to know whom he had to screw to get out of the bloody show, \"the same person you screwed to get into it\". </p> <p>His friend the playwright Peter Nichols says, \"he is as sharp as a tack and very witty\", but face to face Sondheim presents a rather kindly, untidy figure. Mackintosh says: \"Yes, he's always been shambolic but he smartens up well.\" Now 70, hehas a friendly, almost Santa Claus-like face and a bellow of a laugh. </p> <p>\"I am the best laugher.\" he says. \"If you write a comedy, hire me to sit in the audience. Although I tend to guffaw, which is not always great.\" He once went to the theatre with Harold Prince, his collaborator as both producer and director on-and-off for over 40 years, and Prince's wife, Judy, to see an off-Broadway play called Ulysses in Traction by Albert Interado. \"It was about this group of LA university students putting on an insanely pretentious play during the riots. It didn't get very good reviews but we were fans of the writer so we went. And we thought it was screamingly funny. People in the audience were hushing us.\" In the interval they were called into the manager's office because there had been \"complaints about our raucousness. And I said, 'but it's funny', and the manager said, 'I know. I think it's funny, too, but the audience just doesn't get it.'\" </p> <p>Sondheim also admits to being a weeper. \"Listen,\" he says. \"I'm an old Jewish crier. I am easily moved and I love being moved. Like most people in the theatre I have a great facility for suspending disbelief. I will believe anything you tell me. I think it's about fantasy life. I think it's a simple as that.\" </p> <p>Sondheim was an only child, born to wealthy Jewish parents in New York in 1930. Herbert and Janet, known as Foxy, were in the fashion trade. Herbert was the president and Foxy the chief designer of the Sondheim-Levy Company, which had offices on West Thirty Ninth Street and produced what Sondheim's biographer, Meryle Secrest, describes as \"beautifully made clothes of marked style and taste\". Sondheim now says that with two working parents he was really \"an orphan, an institutionalised child\". And one friend remembers that she always thought of him as \"a child pressing his nose against the glass\". </p> <p>Sondheim's father was a benign, if distant, presence who loved to play the piano socially and brought Sondheim up not to stand out, boast or lose his temper. \"I think that's probably why I am not good at immediate responses. I am not quick to anger. I am a slow burner. My father used to think one should be moderate, be nice. Which,\" he adds elliptically, \"is not what most people can be in the circumstances in which we live.\" </p> <p>Sondheim's mother certainly was neither moderate nor nice. \"She was creepy,\" he says. His father ran away with a younger woman when Stephen was 10. Foxy responded with increasing dysfunction. \"She was a career woman and her man done her wrong,\" says Sondheim. \"And hell hath no fury... She took it out on me because she had no one else to take it out on.\" On the night her husband left she woke her son, took him into her bed and cried all over him. He remembers being very uncomfortable. After the divorce she started to behave towards him in a sexually explicit and inappropriate way, he told his biographer. \"I went to a show with her and she not only held my hand, but looked at me during the entire play. And she would sit across from me with her legs aspread. She would lower her blouse and that sort of stuff. But I was surprised rather than shocked.\" </p> <p>In the year they divorced, his parents sent him to military school, which, unexpectedly, he enjoyed enormously. \"The surprise is that I loved military school, because I knew where I was going to be at 9:03 and 9:58 and 12:50 and I needed structure and it gave me that and made me feel the world was not in chaos\". There, he also learned to play the organ. </p> <p>Now he shrugs off the effect of the divorce and his mother's behaviour, although he has had many years of analysis. \"Children of broken homes? There are five million per square inch. I have not lived a very bizarre life. My mother was bizarre but only by degree. The world is full of mothers and fathers like mine. It's just my mother was an extreme case.\" But he also says that she was a compulsive liar, extremely pretentious \"and her values were, to put it mildly, askew. She only really cared about celebrity and money. Which I only became aware of when I started to get successful.\" </p> <p>Their relationship was finally and fatally damaged in the 70s when she wrote him a note before going into hospital. She was going to have a pacemaker fitted and thought she was going to die. The note said: \"The night before I undergo open-heart surgery... the only regret I have in life is giving you birth.\" Sondheim wrote back saying everything he'd never expressed before. He added, though, that he would support her financially. He never saw her again. When she eventually died in 1992 he did not go to her funeral. </p> <p>However, she had made possible one relationship that would be a positive and lasting influence on her son. After the separation she moved from New York to Bucks County in Pennsylvania, just four miles away from a woman friend, an interior decorator, whom she had met in the city. Their sons were the same age and had become friendly. The decorator, Dorothy, was married to the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein. Already musical, Sondheim became a regular visitor, part of the family, and Hammerstein became his mentor. Sondheim has often said, while cautioning that it may sound glib, that all he has ever really wanted to be was what what Oscar was - a songwriter. </p> <p>While Sondheim's father wanted him to \"get a proper job and not become a feckless artist\", Hammerstein was not just a role model for a future career, he also gave Stephen Sondheim his first real work. The lyricist hired the 17-year-old as his assistant at $25 a week on Allegro, a musical he wrote with Richard Rodgers </p> <p>Allegro was about a doctor who grows up in a small town, marries an ambitious woman, becomes successful in New York and ends up giving vitamin injections to the rich until his loving nurse persuades him to return to the country and be a real doctor. As a musical, it was very self-consciously experimental in tackling such a complex and dark subject as a man losing his way in life. It flopped. Sondheim says now: \"It was more than a little significant that it was my first professional experience. It was seminal because I saw a lot of smart people doing something wrong. It's not psychological, the effect. It was nothing to do with the story and me. I just got interested in experimental theatre. Perhaps if I had been an assistant on a George Abbott show (the Broadway producer of The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees), I might not have become the kind of writer I am.\" </p> <p>He has continued to experiment with the musical, he says, not because he is worried about being thematically monotonous, but because he doesn't want to get bored. Harold Prince says that \"he has enormous artistic resources. He has no desire to defend material. He's always willing to throw away a song or an idea because he knows there's always another one. He is very secure.\" </p> <p>But critics have lined up over the years to tell him that the different subjects and emotional territory he chooses for his shows are not the proper stuff of the musical theatre. New York critic Walter Kerr made the position bluntly clear: musicals, he said, should not deal with serious matters. Musicals are for fun. John Lahr, the writer and critic for the New Yorker magazine, is a great admirer of Sondheim's talent but none the less argues: \"You cannot debate in song. Song is a form of enchantment. And Sondheim is on record as saying that he cannot create joy. His intelligence has driven the musical into a cul-de-sac.\" </p> <p>Harold Prince, however, insists \"it's about the story. If Steve has changed the musical, it's not been a conscious effort. His conscious effort is to express himself.\" With the kind of coincidence that challenges astrologers, Sondheim shares the same birthday, March 22, with the populist composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, although Sondheim is 18 years older. The musical influences of their respective generations are reflected in their work. Lloyd Webber was born to pop. But Sondheim was a child of the American stage musicals of the 40s and 50s. Kern, Porter and most importantly Rodgers and Hammerstein, the creators of Oklahoma! and Carousel, are his immediate theatrical family. \"I can never be as interested in pop music as pop fans are,\" he says, while tactfully adding: \"I've never said anything rotten in print about Andrew and he's never said anything about me... Music to me is about harmony and in most pop music the harmony is not interesting because that's not what it was about.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber maintains that \"Sondheim is a very fine melodist, if he chooses to do it. But the difference between us is that he writes his own lyrics. His music is a servant to his lyrics, while I write a big tune.\" Replying to accusations that he does not write hummable tunes, and to those critics who in his early days simply suggested he \"should give up writing music\", Sondheim says that the easy answer \"is often that what I write has to be listened to more than once\". </p> <p>Despite the often expressed view that he has transformed the face of the American musical, or even that, as Peter Nichols suggests, \"has extended its life well beyond what we might have expected\", Sondheim still seems to harbour the illusion that he is just a Broadway Babe writing smash tunes for a mass audience. And he is quite clear about the critical view. \"Does it ever occur to me that I am developing any new kind of musical? How about this for an answer? And you may not believe it. Never!\" </p> <p>He cites Pacific Overtures from 1976, which deals with Japan's emergence from isolation, beginning with the visit of the American envoy Commodore Perry to Japan in 1853. Sondheim has described it as \"the most bizarre and unusual musical ever to be seen in a commercial setting, an attempt to tell a story that has no characters in it at all, that is entirely about ideas\". Yet he says with boyish enthusiasm now, \"all the time we were writing Pacific Overtures, I was thinking the audience is going to love this. It's so exotic, these wonderful costumes, the audience have never seen an entire cast of men, some of whom are in drag. It's going to be fabulous. It never occurred to me that people might not like that, or not get it.\" They didn't. It closed after six months, having lost the entire investment of $650,000. But, like many of Sondheim's shows which were initially panned, it went on to win awards and has been revived successfully many times. </p> <p>Apart from the influence of Hammerstein, Sondheim's inspiration and training also derived from his student years at Williams College in Massachusetts, where in 1950 he won the Hubbard Hutchinson Prize at Princeton. This gave him a two-year fellowship worth a healthy $3,000 to study music under the unlikely tutelage of Arnold Schoenberg's disciple, the avant-garde composer Milton Babbitt. With Sondheim's conscious show-business aspirations, Babbitt, who later would publish an article called \"Who Cares If You Listen\", seemed an odd choice. But Sondheim wanted to learn uncluttered composition theory and harmony. And Babbitt was oddly not only fit for the task, but also something of a frustrated show composer himself. Sondheim's first real income came from a contact made for him by Hammerstein. At a dinner party he was introduced to the writer George Oppenheimer. The result was a collaboration over the scripts for a CBS TV series called Topper, which, Sondheim says, was about \"an elegant, rich, Martini-swigging couple who die in an accident and come back to haunt a man named Cosmo Topper. And constantly screw up his life.\" </p> <p>After five months in Hollywood, and having completed 11 scripts, Sondheim returned to New York in 1953. There, still earning money writing TV scripts, he started to pursue single-mindedly the aim of becoming a composer and lyricist. After a number of ideas that came to nothing, he took his first real step. In 1955 he auditioned his musical and lyrical talents for a show called Saturday Night, which eventually collapsed before it ever got off the ground. </p> <p>The director was Arthur Laurents, who bluntly told Sondheim that he thought his music left much to be desired but that his lyrics were wonderful. Later that year, though, he met Laurents again, this time at a party. The director had moved on to the project - with Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins - which was to become the modern-day telling of the Romeo and Juliet story, originally set in the Lower East Side of New York, but eventually called West Side Story. \"Laurents literally smote his forehead,\" Sondheim has said, \"and went 'I never thought of you'.\" </p> <p>West Side Story was his first success. Sondheim wrote the lyrics for Bernstein's music, although he was so obscure at the time that he wasn't even mentioned in the reviews. But it earned him the beginning of his reputation, as well as the start of a handsome income - although not as great an income as it might have been. </p> <p>The arrangement with Bernstein had started as a partnership, but in the end Sondheim had actually written nearly all the lyrics. The composer, seeing how glum Sondheim was about being ignored by the press, offered him the full credit on the billboards and in the programmes and added, as an afterthought, that they would of course reapportion the royalties: from his three per cent and Sondheim's one, to two each. Sondheim replied: \"Don't be silly, I don't care about the money,\" a remark which he claims must have cost him millions of dollars. </p> <p>Today, he sets relatively little store by money, saying that his tastes are modest. However, by 1987 he acknowledged that he was earning at least $1m a year. </p> <p> The lyrics in West Side Story, according to Lahr, \"defined the buoyancy of the culture after the war, the culture of expectation which would reward you in time.\" He quotes the uplooking, optimistic urgency of the words: </p> <p> Could it be? </p> <p>Yes it could </p> <p>Something's coming, something </p> <p>good... if I can wait </p> <p>Something's coming </p> <p>I don't know </p> <p>What it is </p> <p>But it is </p> <p>Gonna be great </p> <p>\"The US was becoming the most powerful and richest country in the world,\" Lahr argues. \"Incomes tripled in a decade. And to define all that in song is nothing short of brilliant.\" </p> <p>Sondheim then worked on the Ethel Merman show, Gypsy, again just writing the lyrics, this time to the music of Jule Styne, who later wrote Funny Girl. After three years, in 1962, Sondheim had his first Broadway production for which he had written both lyrics and music, A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum, which is still his longest Broadway run, lasting over 750 performances. But it didn't bring him the kind of acclaim from the critics or his peers that he wanted. He had to wait another eight years, until Company in 1970 and the decade on Broadway in which he became what Matt Wolf, the London theatre critic of Variety, calls \"this belligerently non-commercial artist existing in a marketplace which he very much enjoyed\". </p> <p>Wolf recalls a seminar in 1990 when Sondheim was the Cameron Mackintosh visiting professor of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine's College, Oxford. David Aukin, who with Richard Eyre had produced Sunday In The Park With George at the National Theatre, said to Sondheim that it was a shame that he could not have lived in Britain with the benefit of the subsidised theatre, and where he wouldn't have been put under the dreadful commercial pressure of Broadway. \"Without missing a beat,\" according to Wolf, \"Sondheim just said 'But I love Broadway'.\" </p> <p>Sondheim these days describes Broadway as \"a truly annealing experience. It's very good not to be hyper-protected. Anyway you look at it, musicals are a commercial form of popular entertainment. They need exposure and the difficulties of commercial presentation.That makes for better work, not for lesser work.\" </p> <p>The shows defined what most writers see as Sondheim's natural territory: Frank Rich called it \"gimlet-eyed pessimism\", as seen in songs such as The Ladies Who Lunch, from Company, and Losing My Mind, from Follies. Company, regarded by many as his sharpest show, explored the empty and commitment-phobic life of Bobby, a bachelor in New York with wonderful married friends, all of whom are wondering why they're married. Follies was about a theatrical reunion surrounded by the metaphorical rubble of American Vaudeville in a theatre about to be knocked down. Four of the central characters are two couples who never quite got together. What they have had to settle for in their lives is juxtaposed with the optimism of their youth. Julia McKenzie cites from it her favourite Sondheim lyric. </p> <p> All that time wasted </p> <p>Merely passing through, </p> <p>Time I could have spent </p> <p>So content </p> <p>Wasting time with you. </p> <p>If he has changed the face of musical theatre, he has also challenged the love song as a form, preferring to explore the dilemma of desire: that our happiness is torn between the impossibility of being with someone and the agony of being alone. In an outburst of critical disdain, Lahr calls it \"boulevard nihilism\", and then adds provocatively that \"his emotional range is surprisingly small. He is the Sam Beckett of the musical theatre.\" But others realised that he had finally made the musical something worth talking about. When Company arrived in London, the critic Michael Ratcliffe wrote that \"it was discussed with a seriousness normally extended only to new novels and plays\". </p> <p>Lahr says that in much of Sondheim's work there is a sour, disappointed misanthropy. \"And that from a man who doesn't have a relationship.\" Sondheim counters, typically, without emotion but with an artist's intellectual response. \"George Bernard Shaw said that to write you needed observation, imagination and experience. And you can do without any one of them, but not two of them.\" </p> <p>Sondheim is often assaulted with the implication, if not the direct accusation, that he doesn't know what he is talking about when it comes to love as he never admitted anyone to his own life until he was 61. In 1991, he met a young lyricist and composer, Peter Jones, some 35 or so years his junior. They exchanged wedding rings in 1994. Now, however, while they remain very close, they are no longer partners. \"Falling in love is so much to do with luck,\" says Sondheim now. \"I did it very late in life. And, sure, I would like it to happen again.\" </p> <p> In 1981, after what Harold Prince describes as \"what people obviously felt was our decade of too much\", he and Sondheim collaborated on a show, written by George Furth, called Merrily We Roll Along. It is this show that Sondheim is in London to see revived at the Donmar Warehouse, and which contains some of his most beautiful, lingering songs. </p> <p>It was based on a George Kaufman/Moss Hart play that opened on Broadway in 1934 to good reviews, but which was never a hit. Prince, Furth and Sondheim topped that. Their version was not a hit, it got terrible reviews, and it closed after 16 performances. \"Maybe,\" says Prince, \"everyone wanted us to implode.\" What seemed to turn off the audience was that it was not just a story of three friends, a composer, a lyricist and a writer whose youthful idealism and friendship is soured by the great success of one of them, but that it was also told in reverse. The show goes backwards over the 24 years of their friendship to 1957, the year of the Sputnik launch, the symbol of their idealism and hope. </p> <p>Sondheim paraphrases one commentator's summary of the plot: \"He said the central character is an enormously successful playwright on Broadway and is married to the most beautiful star on Broadway, the reigning diva, and the opening scene is on the opening night of his new play and the reviews come in and they're wonderful and the rest of the play deals with how this poor son of a bitch got in such trouble!\" </p> <p>Much work has been done on it since, with Sondheim and Furth having the opportunity to try out several different versions and finally settling on one they liked at Leicester Haymarket in 1993. Perhaps this time round London's critics will be unanimous in their praise. </p> <p>If the project does backfire, however, Sondheim has the advantage of a phlegmatic streak. Cameron Mackintosh says of him that when things go wrong, he's \"wonderfully wry... Once I mentioned to him that I had three shows opening and then realised to my embarrassment that he had five. But he just looked at me and laughed: 'That just means five closings.'\" </p> <p>This quality must also help him to negotiate the irony that, while he has won every critical plaudit and every award America has to offer, from an Oscar (for songs in the Dick Tracy movie) to countless Tonys, he has never really found a mass audience. Sondheim may well have re-invented musical theatre but, as a Broadway Babe, it seems he has honour without profit in his own own country. </p> <p>\u0095 Merrily We Roll Along opens at the Donmar Warehouse on Dec 11.

It's not psychological, the effect. It was nothing to do with the story and me. I just got interested in experimental theatre. Perhaps if I had been an assistant on a George Abbott show (the Broadway producer of The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees), I might not have become the kind of writer I am.\" He has continued to experiment with the musical, he says, not because he is worried about being thematically monotonous, but because he doesn't want to get bored. Harold Prince says that \"he has enormous artistic resources. He has no desire to defend material. He's always willing to throw away a song or an idea because he knows there's always another one. He is very secure.\" But critics have lined up over the years to tell him that the different subjects and emotional territory he chooses for his shows are not the proper stuff of the musical theatre. New York critic Walter Kerr made the position bluntly clear: musicals, he said, should not deal with serious matters. Musicals are for fun. John Lahr, the writer and critic for the New Yorker magazine, is a great admirer of Sondheim's talent but none the less argues: \"You cannot debate in song. Song is a form of enchantment. And Sondheim is on record as saying that he cannot create joy. His intelligence has driven the musical into a cul-de-sac.\" Harold Prince, however, insists \"it's about the story. If Steve has changed the musical, it's not been a conscious effort. His conscious effort is to express himself.\" With the kind of coincidence that challenges astrologers, Sondheim shares the same birthday, March 22, with the populist composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, although Sondheim is 18 years older. The musical influences of their respective generations are reflected in their work. Lloyd Webber was born to pop. But Sondheim was a child of the American stage musicals of the 40s and 50s. Kern, Porter and most importantly Rodgers and Hammerstein, the creators of Oklahoma! and Carousel, are his immediate theatrical family. \"I can never be as interested in pop music as pop fans are,\" he says, while tactfully adding: \"I've never said anything rotten in print about Andrew and he's never said anything about me... Music to me is about harmony and in most pop music the harmony is not interesting because that's not what it was about.\" Lloyd Webber maintains that \"Sondheim is a very fine melodist, if he chooses to do it. But the difference between us is that he writes his own lyrics. His music is a servant to his lyrics, while I write a big tune.\" Replying to accusations that he does not write hummable tunes, and to those critics who in his early days simply suggested he \"should give up writing music\", Sondheim says that the easy answer \"is often that what I write has to be listened to more than once\". Despite the often expressed view that he has transformed the face of the American musical, or even that, as Peter Nichols suggests, \"has extended its life well beyond what we might have expected\", Sondheim still seems to harbour the illusion that he is just a Broadway Babe writing smash tunes for a mass audience. And he is quite clear about the critical view. \"Does it ever occur to me that I am developing any new kind of musical? How about this for an answer? And you may not believe it. Never!\" He cites Pacific Overtures from 1976, which deals with Japan's emergence from isolation, beginning with the visit of the American envoy Commodore Perry to Japan in 1853. Sondheim has described it as \"the most bizarre and unusual musical ever to be seen in a commercial setting, an attempt to tell a story that has no characters in it at all, that is entirely about ideas\". Yet he says with boyish enthusiasm now, \"all the time we were writing Pacific Overtures, I was thinking the audience is going to love this. It's so exotic, these wonderful costumes, the audience have never seen an entire cast of men, some of whom are in drag. It's going to be fabulous. It never occurred to me that people might not like that, or not get it.\" They didn't. It closed after six months, having lost the entire investment of $650,000. But, like many of Sondheim's shows which were initially panned, it went on to win awards and has been revived successfully many times. Apart from the influence of Hammerstein, Sondheim's inspiration and training also derived from his student years at Williams College in Massachusetts, where in 1950 he won the Hubbard Hutchinson Prize at Princeton. This gave him a two-year fellowship worth a healthy $3,000 to study music under the unlikely tutelage of Arnold Schoenberg's disciple, the avant-garde composer Milton Babbitt. With Sondheim's conscious show-business aspirations, Babbitt, who later would publish an article called \"Who Cares If You Listen\", seemed an odd choice. But Sondheim wanted to learn uncluttered composition theory and harmony. And Babbitt was oddly not only fit for the task, but also something of a frustrated show composer himself. Sondheim's first real income came from a contact made for him by Hammerstein. At a dinner party he was introduced to the writer George Oppenheimer. The result was a collaboration over the scripts for a CBS TV series called Topper, which, Sondheim says, was about \"an elegant, rich, Martini-swigging couple who die in an accident and come back to haunt a man named Cosmo Topper. And constantly screw up his life.\" After five months in Hollywood, and having completed 11 scripts, Sondheim returned to New York in 1953. There, still earning money writing TV scripts, he started to pursue single-mindedly the aim of becoming a composer and lyricist. After a number of ideas that came to nothing, he took his first real step. In 1955 he auditioned his musical and lyrical talents for a show called Saturday Night, which eventually collapsed before it ever got off the ground. The director was Arthur Laurents, who bluntly told Sondheim that he thought his music left much to be desired but that his lyrics were wonderful. Later that year, though, he met Laurents again, this time at a party. The director had moved on to the project - with Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins - which was to become the modern-day telling of the Romeo and Juliet story, originally set in the Lower East Side of New York, but eventually called West Side Story. \"Laurents literally smote his forehead,\" Sondheim has said, \"and went 'I never thought of you'.\" West Side Story was his first success. Sondheim wrote the lyrics for Bernstein's music, although he was so obscure at the time that he wasn't even mentioned in the reviews. But it earned him the beginning of his reputation, as well as the start of a handsome income - although not as great an income as it might have been. The arrangement with Bernstein had started as a partnership, but in the end Sondheim had actually written nearly all the lyrics. The composer, seeing how glum Sondheim was about being ignored by the press, offered him the full credit on the billboards and in the programmes and added, as an afterthought, that they would of course reapportion the royalties: from his three per cent and Sondheim's one, to two each. Sondheim replied: \"Don't be silly, I don't care about the money,\" a remark which he claims must have cost him millions of dollars. Today, he sets relatively little store by money, saying that his tastes are modest. However, by 1987 he acknowledged that he was earning at least $1m a year. The lyrics in West Side Story, according to Lahr, \"defined the buoyancy of the culture after the war, the culture of expectation which would reward you in time.\" He quotes the uplooking, optimistic urgency of the words: Could it be? Yes it could Something's coming, something good... if I can wait Something's coming I don't know What it is But it is Gonna be great \"The US was becoming the most powerful and richest country in the world,\" Lahr argues. \"Incomes tripled in a decade. And to define all that in song is nothing short of brilliant.\" Sondheim then worked on the Ethel Merman show, Gypsy, again just writing the lyrics, this time to the music of Jule Styne, who later wrote Funny Girl. After three years, in 1962, Sondheim had his first Broadway production for which he had written both lyrics and music, A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum, which is still his longest Broadway run, lasting over 750 performances. But it didn't bring him the kind of acclaim from the critics or his peers that he wanted. He had to wait another eight years, until Company in 1970 and the decade on Broadway in which he became what Matt Wolf, the London theatre critic of Variety, calls \"this belligerently non-commercial artist existing in a marketplace which he very much enjoyed\". Wolf recalls a seminar in 1990 when Sondheim was the Cameron Mackintosh visiting professor of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine's College, Oxford. David Aukin, who with Richard Eyre had produced Sunday In The Park With George at the National Theatre, said to Sondheim that it was a shame that he could not have lived in Britain with the benefit of the subsidised theatre, and where he wouldn't have been put under the dreadful commercial pressure of Broadway. \"Without missing a beat,\" according to Wolf, \"Sondheim just said 'But I love Broadway'.\" Sondheim these days describes Broadway as \"a truly annealing experience. It's very good not to be hyper-protected. Anyway you look at it, musicals are a commercial form of popular entertainment. They need exposure and the difficulties of commercial presentation.That makes for better work, not for lesser work.\" The shows defined what most writers see as Sondheim's natural territory: Frank Rich called it \"gimlet-eyed pessimism\", as seen in songs such as The Ladies Who Lunch, from Company, and Losing My Mind, from Follies. Company, regarded by many as his sharpest show, explored the empty and commitment-phobic life of Bobby, a bachelor in New York with wonderful married friends, all of whom are wondering why they're married. Follies was about a theatrical reunion surrounded by the metaphorical rubble of American Vaudeville in a theatre about to be knocked down. Four of the central characters are two couples who never quite got together. What they have had to settle for in their lives is juxtaposed with the optimism of their youth. Julia McKenzie cites from it her favourite Sondheim lyric. All that time wasted Merely passing through, Time I could have spent So content Wasting time with you. If he has changed the face of musical theatre, he has also challenged the love song as a form, preferring to explore the dilemma of desire: that our happiness is torn between the impossibility of being with someone and the agony of being alone. In an outburst of critical disdain, Lahr calls it \"boulevard nihilism\", and then adds provocatively that \"his emotional range is surprisingly small. He is the Sam Beckett of the musical theatre.\" But others realised that he had finally made the musical something worth talking about. When Company arrived in London, the critic Michael Ratcliffe wrote that \"it was discussed with a seriousness normally extended only to new novels and plays\". Lahr says that in much of Sondheim's work there is a sour, disappointed misanthropy. \"And that from a man who doesn't have a relationship.\" Sondheim counters, typically, without emotion but with an artist's intellectual response. \"George Bernard Shaw said that to write you needed observation, imagination and experience. And you can do without any one of them, but not two of them.\" Sondheim is often assaulted with the implication, if not the direct accusation, that he doesn't know what he is talking about when it comes to love as he never admitted anyone to his own life until he was 61. In 1991, he met a young lyricist and composer, Peter Jones, some 35 or so years his junior. They exchanged wedding rings in 1994. Now, however, while they remain very close, they are no longer partners. \"Falling in love is so much to do with luck,\" says Sondheim now. \"I did it very late in life. And, sure, I would like it to happen again.\" In 1981, after what Harold Prince describes as \"what people obviously felt was our decade of too much\", he and Sondheim collaborated on a show, written by George Furth, called Merrily We Roll Along. It is this show that Sondheim is in London to see revived at the Donmar Warehouse, and which contains some of his most beautiful, lingering songs. It was based on a George Kaufman/Moss Hart play that opened on Broadway in 1934 to good reviews, but which was never a hit. Prince, Furth and Sondheim topped that. Their version was not a hit, it got terrible reviews, and it closed after 16 performances. \"Maybe,\" says Prince, \"everyone wanted us to implode.\" What seemed to turn off the audience was that it was not just a story of three friends, a composer, a lyricist and a writer whose youthful idealism and friendship is soured by the great success of one of them, but that it was also told in reverse. The show goes backwards over the 24 years of their friendship to 1957, the year of the Sputnik launch, the symbol of their idealism and hope. Sondheim paraphrases one commentator's summary of the plot: \"He said the central character is an enormously successful playwright on Broadway and is married to the most beautiful star on Broadway, the reigning diva, and the opening scene is on the opening night of his new play and the reviews come in and they're wonderful and the rest of the play deals with how this poor son of a bitch got in such trouble!\" Much work has been done on it since, with Sondheim and Furth having the opportunity to try out several different versions and finally settling on one they liked at Leicester Haymarket in 1993. Perhaps this time round London's critics will be unanimous in their praise. If the project does backfire, however, Sondheim has the advantage of a phlegmatic streak. Cameron Mackintosh says of him that when things go wrong, he's \"wonderfully wry... Once I mentioned to him that I had three shows opening and then realised to my embarrassment that he had five. But he just looked at me and laughed: 'That just means five closings.'\" This quality must also help him to negotiate the irony that, while he has won every critical plaudit and every award America has to offer, from an Oscar (for songs in the Dick Tracy movie) to countless Tonys, he has never really found a mass audience. Sondheim may well have re-invented musical theatre but, as a Broadway Babe, it seems he has honour without profit in his own own country. \u0095 Merrily We Roll Along opens at the Donmar Warehouse on Dec 11.

There he is in the trenches in 1916, healthy and young, then back in Blighty in 1918, so stiff and aged you can't tell if this is really how he looks after three years in uniform, or simply how he feels. Here's one of his best-known war cartoons, Faster! No, I Ain't Going No Faster..., showing two Tommies trudging through the battlefield mud. There's the beautiful Pie, calm and perfectly groomed after their marriage in 1904, and a little more human in 1917, as Kipper imagines her in the underwear she described to him in one of her letters to the front. His coy caption reads, \"Is this rather a nice young person?\" She died 10 years later, during an operation to relieve her asthma, and there's something stupidly affecting about the little detail that this casual drawing was made in indelible pencil. And here are Kipper and Pie's kids: Mary as a very grown-up four-year-old messing around in the kitchen in an oversized apron, Graham as a plump, gurgling baby and again as a pretty child with a page-boy haircut. </p> <p>He died in 1943, aged 36, when the Germans sank the ship on which he was serving. The book that accompanies this exhibition tells us that Christopher Robin was partly based on sketches of Graham as a six-year-old, and the model for Pooh was his teddy. What went through Shepard's mind when he returned to Milne's tales after his son's death? Were they a comfort or a torment? </p> <p>In his will, Shepard asked biographers to leave him alone until 30 years after his death. In the meantime, if you're desperate for a happy ending, take a good look at the jacket he drew for the Christopher Robin Story Book more than 20 years after Graham's death. The golden-haired boy is stretched out on a grassy hill surrounded by Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and the rest of the gang. He looks sleepy, sweet, innocent and content. The sun is shining. </p> <p>\u0095 The Man Who Drew Pooh: the Art of EH Shepard is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London SE21 (020-8693 5254), until January 21.

But the show does bring out both the range of Shepard's talent and the richness and tragedy of his long life. Here's the artist informally known as Kipper looking soulful after becoming engaged to his first wife, Florence (aka Pie). There he is in the trenches in 1916, healthy and young, then back in Blighty in 1918, so stiff and aged you can't tell if this is really how he looks after three years in uniform, or simply how he feels. Here's one of his best-known war cartoons, Faster! No, I Ain't Going No Faster..., showing two Tommies trudging through the battlefield mud. There's the beautiful Pie, calm and perfectly groomed after their marriage in 1904, and a little more human in 1917, as Kipper imagines her in the underwear she described to him in one of her letters to the front. His coy caption reads, \"Is this rather a nice young person?\" She died 10 years later, during an operation to relieve her asthma, and there's something stupidly affecting about the little detail that this casual drawing was made in indelible pencil. And here are Kipper and Pie's kids: Mary as a very grown-up four-year-old messing around in the kitchen in an oversized apron, Graham as a plump, gurgling baby and again as a pretty child with a page-boy haircut. He died in 1943, aged 36, when the Germans sank the ship on which he was serving. The book that accompanies this exhibition tells us that Christopher Robin was partly based on sketches of Graham as a six-year-old, and the model for Pooh was his teddy. What went through Shepard's mind when he returned to Milne's tales after his son's death? Were they a comfort or a torment? In his will, Shepard asked biographers to leave him alone until 30 years after his death. In the meantime, if you're desperate for a happy ending, take a good look at the jacket he drew for the Christopher Robin Story Book more than 20 years after Graham's death. The golden-haired boy is stretched out on a grassy hill surrounded by Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and the rest of the gang. He looks sleepy, sweet, innocent and content. The sun is shining. \u0095 The Man Who Drew Pooh: the Art of EH Shepard is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London SE21 (020-8693 5254), until January 21. The Story of EH Shepard, the Man Who Drew Pooh, is published by Jaydem Books, price \u00a319.99.",

After the elections of November 1988 failed to shift the balance of power significantly, the coalition was renewed, with Shamir retaining the premiership, and Peres still serving as foreign minister. The arrangement finally broke down in 1990, because of the parties' incompatible views of the peace process.

Hypothetically, president-elect Bush might persuade his running-mate Dick Cheney to stand down, citing Cheney's recent ill-health; the vice-presidency could then be offered to Al Gore. In the alternative imaginary scenario, vice-president-elect Joe Lieberman would opt to take up his Senate seat, whereupon president-elect Gore would offer the number two spot to Bush. After so radical a move, the creation of a genuine coalition cabinet would be relatively - and I mean relatively - simple.

      "body": "<p>Lord Macaulay's famous poem The Lays of Ancient Rome was a best-seller in its Victorian heyday and for long afterwards. It tells how Horatius defended the bridge into Rome against its recently deposed king, Tarquin the Proud, and his ally Lars Porsena of Clusium. Tarquin had been a cruel and arrogant monarch, and the new republic was determined to be free of kings for ever. Horatius held the would-be invaders at bay while his comrades demolished the bridge behind him; and then, shouting an invocation to the god of the Tiber, he threw himself into its foaming waters, armour and all, and struggled back to the new Republic's cheering city shore.</p> <p>A great irony surrounds this poem's success. Generations of public schoolboys - sons of the aristocracy, gentry and wealthy bourgeoisie - were encouraged to read it so that they could admire and emulate Horatius's selfless patriotism when, in their own turn, they went to serve their country. Yet the poem celebrates the birth of republicanism in Rome, and with it the ejection of its royal family, whose relation to Rome is forever symbolised by a rape: the rape of Lucretia by a Tarquin prince, an act which serves to encapsulate the expropriation of the wealth, liberties and rights of many by a hereditary few. So much did republicanism matter to the Romans that they passed a law banning monarchy for ever. Julius Caesar was murdered because his contemporaries thought he wished to be king; Augustus and all the emperors who followed never called themselves kings, though they were kings in fact.</p> <p>So the members of royal Britain's establishment, including its soldiers, servants of Empire, and statesmen, were all educated in the austere virtues of Roman republicanism, yet they defended the crown to the last drops of their blood, and gratefully accepted from it honours and privileges in return. This in effect is still how things work in contemporary Britain; for although there are no great absolute monarchies left, the hierarchical social systems bequeathed by them persist in many places, and nowhere more obviously than in the United Kingdom, where titles, rank and station, the divisions between higher and lower classes, and priority and deference in social relations, all still exist.</p> <p>To see what this means in practice one needs to note certain general points about social organisation. Societies employ a variety of ways to organise themselves, seeking to direct and control the behaviour of their members by means ranging from written laws to unwritten conventions. At one extreme they use imprisonment and execution as final sanctions against individuals who refuse to conform to requirements, while at the other they use education, persuasion, and the inducement of rewards and honours.</p> <p>Closer to the former than the latter in society's armoury lie disapproval and social exclusion. These are potent weapons. Half a century ago unhappily married couples were encouraged to endure by the threat of opprobrium surrounding divorce. Today many things still carry enough stigma, despite being legal, to prevent people doing or at least acknowledging them - homosexuality is a case in point. The idea of an honour code, of disgrace, of what constitutes gentlemanly behaviour, implies internalised ideas of what society approves, and they are a powerful influence on the way many people act.</p> <p>As societies have aged, their organisational structures have ossified. Rewards for good service to society (or its ruling elite) became hereditary and, because they once frequently took the form of land and titles, generations or even centuries later the descendants of the good servant still enjoy his dignity - for no better reason than that they are the latest issue in a series of pregnancies begun by him.</p> <p>An essential component of a system where reward takes the form of rank and title is that the resulting hierarchy has to confer practical advantages on those who get them. For if the system is to work, people lower in the order have to show deference to those above them, and accept their condescension in return. Religion has always been a help to ruling elites here, by preaching the divine ordination of the arrangement by which rich men sit in their castles and poor men sit at their gates. As various uprisings throughout history show, not everyone was persuaded by this theology.</p> <p>The functioning of social hierarchy is not just a matter of rustics pulling off their caps and standing aside as milord's carriage swishes by, splattering them with mud; it is as deeply rooted in the ambiguous and overfine strata occupying the space between peasants and peers. Thus the reason for the class divisions, deference, social climbing, false accents, forelock-tugging and snobbery that scar the face of British society. Telling examples are provided by Mr Collins in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, exuding oil at every mention of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, or Uriah Heep rubbing his hands together and bowing 'umbly throughout Dickens's David Copperfield. At least Heep did not really mean it; but for many real-life cases not much different from his, deference was a matter of livelihood, even of life.</p> <p>Some thinkers believe that deference is an important ingredient in the proper functioning of society. \"Without feelings of respect,\" asked Confucius, \"what is there to distinguish men from beasts?\" And Thomas Carlyle (typically for him) asked, \"Does not every true man feel that he is himself made higher by doing reverence to what is really above him?\" This was not a religious remark; it occurs in Carlyle's Heroes and Hero-Worship, as part of the reason why we should respect our betters. Neither of these writers would much appreciate the satire of Joseph Addison's Court of Honour, in which those annoyed by their inferiors' failure to doff their hats, or to \"give them the wall\" when crossing paths in the street, were arraigned for their crimes and condignly punished.</p> <p>It seems trivial now that members of the aristocracy and gentry once expended much energy on deciding who could precede whom in and out of dining rooms. Do younger sons of barons take precedence over elder sons of knights? On whose arm should the eldest daughter of an earl go in to dinner? Everyone in the procession, hungry or not, had to defer to at least one other person, except for the most senior lady present, who could lead the way with equanimity. When Lady Macbeth wished to clear her dining room in a hurry because her husband was having a mad fit - he had seen Banquo's ghost, and she thought he might reveal their murder of Duncan - she shouted at her guests, \"Do not stand on the order of thy going, but go!\" The business of queuing up according to social rank is a very old one, and we can well imagine the gaggle of alarmed lords trying to get behind one another in a hurry.</p> <p>Supporters of hierarchy, and its associated practices of social deference, deliberately or otherwise ignore much. They ignore the assumptions that lie behind such practices as kowtowing in imperial China, where a person of lower rank had to kneel and touch his head to the ground as obeisance to a person of higher rank, or the \"droit de seigneur\" in medieval France, according to which the local lord had rights over the maidenhead of any new bride in his domain. Both kowtowing and seigniorial sexual rights recapitulate the behaviour of non-human social animals. A dog defers to a higher-ranking dog in the pack - prostrating itself, exposing its vulnerable neck or belly to the superior, as if to say, \"Kill me if you wish.\" Likewise among deer: bucks who acknowledge the dominance of one of their number leave the does in their herd to him.</p> <p>Such behaviour is an instinctual way of defusing the aggression of higher-ranking animals, and it therefore keeps the peace where doing so might be a matter of life and death. Among humans, deference performs a similar function; but, given that intelligence has helped us master many of our instincts and to overcome many forms of behaviour only suited to a state of unreflective struggle for existence in the wild, the requirement of automatic deference is not only no longer necessary, it has become institutionalised insult, and it does great harm.</p> <p>The reason is twofold. First, although there are of course cases where a certain kind of deference is appropriate - as when, in the matter of a burst pipe, one defers to a plumber's expertise - they are only cases where an appropriate and particular knowledge or ability is at issue. One defers to the plumber's expertise in the given case, not to the plumber himself. And it is only the given case that counts; one would not defer to his expertise if one had burst a blood-vessel rather than a water pipe. Nor in any circumstances would one defer to him because, in addition to being a plumber, he happened to be a duke.</p> <p>Secondly, the system of social deference has been one of the main causes of human waste in history. Think of Gray's Elegy, in which the mute inglorious Miltons, the village Hampdens, the Cromwells sleeping under the rustic turf, never strayed from their sequestered vale because their position in life - worse, their fear of aspiring \"above their station\" or of \"not knowing their place\" - left their gifts unformed, their potential stifled and lost. In a social system which, for all that it permits a degree of upward and downward mobility, fixes divisions between people, there is bound to be massive wastage of human ability. Apart from the loss to science and art, to politics and invention, there is deep injustice in a dispensation where lives are blighted because of the inanities of social hierarchy.</p> <p>That is why Mark Twain's remark that \"irreverence is the champion of liberty, and its only sure defence\" is so strikingly true. It makes one see clearly the insidious harm of snobbery, which, whether or not its votaries get the deference they expect from those perceived as lower than themselves, tells us that they have the monstrous effrontery to place themselves higher. In Nancy Mitford's famous essay - the one that put into public currency the \"U and non-U\" distinction (\"lavatory\" and \"napkin\" are \"upper class\" usages, as opposed to their \"non-upper class\" cognates \"toilet\" and \"serviette\") - we read that the English aristocracy \"has real political power through the House of Lords, and real social position through the Queen\". The first part of this sentence is, mercifully and by a whisker, no longer true - we only just managed to abandon feu dalism before the 20th century ended - but the second half, for all its fogginess of meaning, touches a nerve.</p> <p>While we have a monarchy, and with it a system of titles and honours, the insidious consequences of social hierarchy remain. In places like the Netherlands and Denmark, where royals bicycle to the local cinema and aristocracy is a dead letter, there is much less occasion for snobbery and division. Acts of deference, if they occur, are more likely to be prompted by a sense of individual merit than institutional reflex. But it is alive and kicking in the United Kingdom because of its firm grasp on too much of the popular imagination. Readers of magazines about royals and aristocrats revel in the panoply of titles and (what they suppose to be) high life; a different part of the population aspires to be Sir This or Lady That, and to carry their noses in the air. Something diseased in the national soul allows all this to continue, forgetting - if ever it knew - what class and its attendant culture of deference really means: obsequiousness, servility, fawning, affected or ingratiating regard for another's wishes, an eager and exaggerated paying of court.</p> <p>In practice this very often means subordinating worth and talent to fictions of rank and title, and perpetuating deep divisions in society either on the accidental basis of birth, or on fabricated notions of social rank, allowing them to outweigh real distinctions of merit and genuine entitlements to reward. It is no achievement to have a rich or titled father, who can send one to the best schools and supply useful social connections and business opportunities. Only think of the wise and thoughtful people whose advice was never taken, and whose experience was never consulted, because they happened not to inherit a title that gave them a seat in the House of Lords - where, instead, any inbred, pampered, sheltered scion of privilege could be allowed to influence the laws of the land, even if it meant doing so in the interests of nothing other than his own acres and perquisites.</p> <p>On its best construction, deference can of course mean respect or esteem of the kind that might be owed another who deserves it. It implies making way, yielding to the authority or seniority of another when merited. But in a class society it is the less positive construction that dominates. Because of its importance to the social structure, and especially of those whose chief interest lies in maintaining it, the attitudes inimical to deference are given bad names: insolence, irreverence, disesteem, disfavour, discourtesy, incivility and rudeness. The three latter are unpleasant things in anyone's book, because they undermine the proper regard which people should automatically have for one another. But as implying a lack of deference, the rest have a healthy ring.</p> <p>For deference begins in dependency. When the peasant on the land had only the option of starving, he was quick to pull off his cap or tug his forelock when the man who had his fate in his hands rode by. In this way an inspection of the origins and meanings of the concept of deference shows that the pieties of Confucius and Carlyle mask much that is fundamentally unacceptable. And when one asks what keeps this queer and harmful arrangement in being, and sees that it is the heavy weight of history, the corpse of a social order whose dead limbs still sprawl over us, one sees what needs to be done to escape it. And that is: to clear away the false old names and ways, and to put in their place a system that recognises merit, and gives it the applause of equals.</p>",

In 1980, he founded Stringfellow's in London, and has gone on to become one of the world's best known nightclub owners. He is twice divorced, and has two children. His autobiography is entitled King Of Clubs. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Anchoring my yacht off Ibiza for a video shoot with four of my beautiful girls, including my girlfriend. What is your greatest fear? I've already had a taste of it - that is, losing my business. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? The way I will let something go just to make others comfortable and happy. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Disloyalty and dishonesty. What do you most dislike about your appearance? I'm getting older. What is your most unappealing habit? To keep my image perfect with the girls, I refuse to answer that question! What is your favourite book? Invariably the one I've just read. What is your favourite fantasy? I've had my fantasies. One I'd like to revisit is being on a deserted white beach about to make love to somebody who wants you to make love to them. You can't get any better, trust me. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes, but I've always found it difficult. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? All the time, but I don't use the words 'in love' unless I mean it. Which words or phrases do you most overuse? I promise. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? To get my eyesight back to perfect, to get rid of the tinnitus in my left ear, and to lose a stone in weight. What keeps you awake at night? Trying to make love when I'm drunk, and the Discovery Channel. How would you like to die? I'd like to know I was going, and then spend whatever time I had left on my boat in the sun with a vodka and tonic. Do you believe in life after death? I think there is something beyond the comprehension of human beings. How would you like to be remembered? Very few people are remembered - and I'm not one of them. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? That it is truly - cliche of cliches - a wonderful life.",

      "body": "<p>The phrase 'party wine' is merely a synonym for something cheap and rarely cheerful that doesn't aim to be too thrilling, because a thrilling wine would only entice guests to wear out their welcome as they worked their way through the dregs of every last bottle. So, of the wines that follow, all are suited to parties, from a PTA get-together to an extravagant orgy. </p> <p>Let us open with Somerfield, which has some terrific wines on special offer until January 2. Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points out of 20, on offer at \u00a33.99), from Australia, is, for the money, one of the more striking examples of this often fatuously vinified grape. Hardys Nottage Hill Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.79) has engaging tannins and a subtle spiciness to its rich, ripe fruit, and represents one of the Aussie's smoothest red wine bargains. Domaine de Courtilles Cte 125 Corbi\u00e8res 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.49) offers unusually stealthy and thickly knitted fruit that moves like lava across the tastebuds, revealing soft and warm nuances of plum and blackberry. Argento Malbec 1999 (at selected branches, call 0117 935 6669 for details) has beautifully textured, soft, red fruit with a savoury undertone - eagle-eyed readers will note that it has featured here before, but not as low as \u00a33.99 and not quite as high as 16.5 points. A solidly fruity French red and white pair is Winter Hill Rouge and Winter Hill Blanc, both 1999s from l'Aude and available at \u00a32.99 apiece. The red rates 14 points, being civilised and fruitily accomplished; the white rates 15 points, and is fine with smoked fish. Both are dry, respectable rather than exciting, but with food they represent excellent value. A white with a more luxurious finish and perfume is Domaine du Bois Viognier Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998, which fits the bill perfectly, not least because said bill is a faintly risible \u00a33.49. This 16-pointer has lovely texture and a smoky edge to its apricot fruitiness, which make it so palate-teasingly breezy. </p> <p>Asda has a wealth of inexpensive bottles, but this week's offerings from this retailer feature three luxury reds and a sparkling wine to entertain any lunch party at which game features. Temple Bruer Shiraz/Malbec 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.96), from Australia, is a wonderfully adult blend of rich, jammy shiraz and dry, tannic malbec - the marriage is harmonious and energetic, food-friendly and deliciously deep. Ruvello Cabernet Sauvignon Passito 1998 (17 points, \u00a37.99), from Italy, is a most individual cabernet of urgency yet with complex, lingering, slow-moving fruit that finishes strongly. Dry yet rich and delicate, earthy yet not inelegant, it has gentle tannins and great class. Crozes Hermitage Les Haut de Pavi\u00e8res 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.88) is a classic Crozes mouthful, where the immediate plummy richness turns marvellously dry, smoky and chewy, and goes on developing layers of tarry fruit as it quits the throat. Bleasdale Sparkling Shiraz 1999 (16 points, \u00a38.97) overflows with hedgerow fruit and is the quintessential Australian happy-juice. </p> <p>For elite parties of red wine sybarites, Sainsbury has Domaine Michel Bernard Chateauneuf-du-Pape 1998 (17 points, \u00a310.99, selected branches, 0800 632262 for details), which is a wine of enticing aroma, great depth yet finesse, complexity, power and delicacy. Unwins also caters for such groups with Henriques &amp; Henriques 10-Year-Old Malmsey Madeira (16 points, \u00a315.09), which is like sipping vinified fruitcake - it is one of those compelling fortified wines for occasions when a certain excess is permitted, and is utterly delicious and heart-rousing. It may also, with certain intimate groupings of two like-minded citizens, arouse a good deal more. </p> <p>As would Apostoles Palo Cortado Muy Viejo, in the half bottle at Waitrose for \u00a310.25.

      "bodyText": "The phrase 'party wine' is merely a synonym for something cheap and rarely cheerful that doesn't aim to be too thrilling, because a thrilling wine would only entice guests to wear out their welcome as they worked their way through the dregs of every last bottle. So, of the wines that follow, all are suited to parties, from a PTA get-together to an extravagant orgy. Let us open with Somerfield, which has some terrific wines on special offer until January 2. Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points out of 20, on offer at \u00a33.99), from Australia, is, for the money, one of the more striking examples of this often fatuously vinified grape. Hardys Nottage Hill Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.79) has engaging tannins and a subtle spiciness to its rich, ripe fruit, and represents one of the Aussie's smoothest red wine bargains. Domaine de Courtilles Cte 125 Corbi\u00e8res 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.49) offers unusually stealthy and thickly knitted fruit that moves like lava across the tastebuds, revealing soft and warm nuances of plum and blackberry. Argento Malbec 1999 (at selected branches, call 0117 935 6669 for details) has beautifully textured, soft, red fruit with a savoury undertone - eagle-eyed readers will note that it has featured here before, but not as low as \u00a33.99 and not quite as high as 16.5 points. A solidly fruity French red and white pair is Winter Hill Rouge and Winter Hill Blanc, both 1999s from l'Aude and available at \u00a32.99 apiece. The red rates 14 points, being civilised and fruitily accomplished; the white rates 15 points, and is fine with smoked fish. Both are dry, respectable rather than exciting, but with food they represent excellent value. A white with a more luxurious finish and perfume is Domaine du Bois Viognier Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998, which fits the bill perfectly, not least because said bill is a faintly risible \u00a33.49. This 16-pointer has lovely texture and a smoky edge to its apricot fruitiness, which make it so palate-teasingly breezy. Asda has a wealth of inexpensive bottles, but this week's offerings from this retailer feature three luxury reds and a sparkling wine to entertain any lunch party at which game features. Temple Bruer Shiraz/Malbec 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.96), from Australia, is a wonderfully adult blend of rich, jammy shiraz and dry, tannic malbec - the marriage is harmonious and energetic, food-friendly and deliciously deep. Ruvello Cabernet Sauvignon Passito 1998 (17 points, \u00a37.99), from Italy, is a most individual cabernet of urgency yet with complex, lingering, slow-moving fruit that finishes strongly. Dry yet rich and delicate, earthy yet not inelegant, it has gentle tannins and great class. Crozes Hermitage Les Haut de Pavi\u00e8res 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.88) is a classic Crozes mouthful, where the immediate plummy richness turns marvellously dry, smoky and chewy, and goes on developing layers of tarry fruit as it quits the throat. Bleasdale Sparkling Shiraz 1999 (16 points, \u00a38.97) overflows with hedgerow fruit and is the quintessential Australian happy-juice. For elite parties of red wine sybarites, Sainsbury has Domaine Michel Bernard Chateauneuf-du-Pape 1998 (17 points, \u00a310.99, selected branches, 0800 632262 for details), which is a wine of enticing aroma, great depth yet finesse, complexity, power and delicacy. Unwins also caters for such groups with Henriques &amp; Henriques 10-Year-Old Malmsey Madeira (16 points, \u00a315.09), which is like sipping vinified fruitcake - it is one of those compelling fortified wines for occasions when a certain excess is permitted, and is utterly delicious and heart-rousing. It may also, with certain intimate groupings of two like-minded citizens, arouse a good deal more. As would Apostoles Palo Cortado Muy Viejo, in the half bottle at Waitrose for \u00a310.25. Even for parties of one, this is the ultimate treat: a sherry of huge, treacly texture (but not crude sweetness), baked apple and cobnut-crumble-edged fruit with touches of liquorice. It has a gripping finish and lingering richness and rates 18.5 points. A true companion for the bookworm and similar hedonistic solipsists. \u0095 Superplonk 2001 is published by Hodder Headline at \u00a310.99.

      "body": "<p>Everyone enjoys a party - unless they're a hermit or strictly religious - but don't think it's going to happen by itself. If you plan to entertain friends, there are a few tricks that will help you get it right. The golden rule ought to be, never do it in your home. We all know what happens: it gets trashed. When people have more than two drinks inside them, ashtrays tend to disappear, cigarettes are stubbed out on the carpet and drinks get spilt. It doesn't matter how much respect people would normally have for your house - after several bottles of champagne, they lose it. Worst of all is the toilet situation: most people only have one loo in their home and if you're inviting, say, 50 guests, that means trouble.</p> <p>There are alternatives: head down the road to the local pub, hire a marquee or go to the park if it's summer; or persuade a friend to lend you their nice loft-style apartment and cover the floor in plastic.</p> <p>But the fact is, the best parties are very often at the host's own home - like the one I went to last New Year at Ronnie and Jo Wood's. About 20 of us sat down for dinner, then there was a full party afterwards, when loads of guests arrived. They had arranged a DJ booth and a proper dancefloor; everything was perfectly organised.</p> <p>Organisation, you see, is the key. If you're going to have a house party - and don't say I didn't warn you - first settle your guest list. Here, you have to be quite heartless: you've got to set yourself a number and stick to it . Obviously, some of your friends don't mix well, so you have to be wary of this. You don't want couples that have split up bringing their new partners and then making a big scene. So always be upfront and honest - tell one of the couples that you don't think it's a good idea because so-and-so is coming, or let them decide for themselves who is going to be there.</p> <p>Ask your guests to arrive at around 10pm. That way, they will have eaten first and you won't have to provide food. Start any earlier, and you're talking about a cocktail party, which means you have to serve food, get caterers in and do flash little canap\u00e9s - you really don't want the added trouble of doing your own cooking. Also, this kind of gathering is often quite boring: it'll end about 10pm, and your guests will then go on to the really good party, which will finish about 4am.</p> <p>Never let people know about your party too far in advance, because if you tell them, say, three weeks before, everyone will forget about it and throw away the invite. About a week before is a safe bet, because your guests will know by then what they've got on that week, and can rejig their arrangements. Also, don't worry about someone else having a party at the same time and friends not coming to yours, because anyone can go to two parties in a night. Anyway, because yours is going to be better, they are always going to come to you.</p> <p>Be similarly confident about how many guests you want. Invite only the number you expect to turn up - perhaps a few more (this is determined by how many you can fit into your space). If it's a personal party, most people will make the effort.</p> <p>Also, to keep out those you don't want turning up, it's a good idea to have someone on the door. They don't have to be professional bouncers; it could be a big friend or neighbour. This will stop gate-crashers - they are always the ones who cause the most damage, after all. However, you must also be prepared for guests getting out of control - the moment they do, ask them to leave and get them out before they scare off other friends.</p> <p>As for yourself, try to relax - although this is always going to be difficult when you've got loads of people running around your house. If anything goes missing, for instance, it will probably turn up in the morning, so don't, when you've had a few drinks, go around accusing everyone of taking it.</p> <p>But whoever is being the security person, make sure they know what they are doing. When we opened Sugar Reef, for example, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and their entourages walked in and the security, who were under-experienced, would not clear a table for them, so they left. And I still haven't heard the last about the opening of Rock that I organised last March, when the bouncers wouldn't let George Clooney in. His driver came over and said to the doormen, \"I've got George Clooney in the car\" and they said, \"Let's see him, then\", and he wouldn't get out of the car, so they didn't let him in. Now, do you honestly think that someone as famous as George Clooney is going to hang around in the street - where hundreds of people will recognise him - while a doorman checks the guest list?</p> <p>The idea of some people being more special than others is always going to cause problems, so never have a VIP, red-rope area (ie, the room upstairs that's out of bounds to all except your best friends). Everyone thinks they're a VIP anyway, and it will only create a bad atmosphere.</p> <p>At the beginning of the party, stay near the door to greet people, making sure that everyone is all right and that they've got a drink. Once you have got them inside, you don't want them blocking the hall looking for somewhere to put their coats, so point them to the bedroom for the coats, then to the drinks and get them out of the corridor. Stay sober for the first couple of hours at least, but don't stay on guard all night - otherwise, you won't have much fun.</p> <p>What type of drink you provide depends on how much you want to spend. Personally, I think it's always good to have white and red wine, beer, and sea breeze, because then you have more or less covered every option - most people will like one (or all) of those. That's quite a low-budget bar, but it is also a good one: you have got grapefruit and cranberry juice for the sea breeze, so there are some soft drinks available, though always provide bottles of water, too. People are not going to complain that you do not have a wide selection: all they want is a drink - any drink. Also, ask guests to bring a bottle if they want, though do not raise your eyebrows if they don't. And if they bring a bottle of squash, you have got to say, \"That's great.\"</p> <p>I would have a nice little bar in the corner of one room - not in the kitchen, though, because it's too small and is always banged out with people; everyone always goes there to get a drink, and it ends up like a blitzed area. Instead, put a cloth over a table and place the drinks on it.</p> <p>Don't let guests help themselves, either: get a friend or young cousin who wants to earn a few bob, and ask them to act as bartender. And use plastic cups, not glasses, even if it's a special occasion - people really don't mind that sort of thing.</p> <p>As for the amount of drink to buy, always, always have extra. Never let it run out. If the drink goes, so do the guests - and that'll be it, the end of the party. Get the barman to keep an eye on things, and if he thinks you're going to run out, ask someone to go to the off-licence. A rule of thumb is to double the amount you think you'll need.</p> <p>After the alcohol, music is the most important thing. The drink should be in one corner - or even in another room - the music in the other. I've been to parties where all they have got is a basic stereo, which just doesn't work: you are only going to get two or three people fighting over which CD to put on. Everyone knows someone, even if it's only a friend of a friend, who's got decks, so set them up in the corner and get some guy to do their thing - there are hundreds of thousands of aspiring DJs out there who'll be only to willing to play in return for free beer.</p> <p>Good music, dancing, everyone getting drunk and having a laugh - that's my idea of a good time</p> <p>\u0095 Fran Cutler is a director of events organiser 2 ACTIVE, 020-7631 4244</p>",

That's quite a low-budget bar, but it is also a good one: you have got grapefruit and cranberry juice for the sea breeze, so there are some soft drinks available, though always provide bottles of water, too. People are not going to complain that you do not have a wide selection: all they want is a drink - any drink. Also, ask guests to bring a bottle if they want, though do not raise your eyebrows if they don't. And if they bring a bottle of squash, you have got to say, \"That's great.\" I would have a nice little bar in the corner of one room - not in the kitchen, though, because it's too small and is always banged out with people; everyone always goes there to get a drink, and it ends up like a blitzed area. Instead, put a cloth over a table and place the drinks on it. Don't let guests help themselves, either: get a friend or young cousin who wants to earn a few bob, and ask them to act as bartender. And use plastic cups, not glasses, even if it's a special occasion - people really don't mind that sort of thing. As for the amount of drink to buy, always, always have extra. Never let it run out. If the drink goes, so do the guests - and that'll be it, the end of the party. Get the barman to keep an eye on things, and if he thinks you're going to run out, ask someone to go to the off-licence. A rule of thumb is to double the amount you think you'll need. After the alcohol, music is the most important thing. The drink should be in one corner - or even in another room - the music in the other. I've been to parties where all they have got is a basic stereo, which just doesn't work: you are only going to get two or three people fighting over which CD to put on. Everyone knows someone, even if it's only a friend of a friend, who's got decks, so set them up in the corner and get some guy to do their thing - there are hundreds of thousands of aspiring DJs out there who'll be only to willing to play in return for free beer. Good music, dancing, everyone getting drunk and having a laugh - that's my idea of a good time \u0095 Fran Cutler is a director of events organiser 2 ACTIVE, 020-7631 4244",

      "bodyText": "Germany's disgraced former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, applied for an injunction yesterday to block the release of transcripts of his tapped telephone conversations. A parliamentary commission is investigating whether Mr Kohl's governments swapped favours for party donations. There had been speculation that publication of the documents would decisively alter the course of the drawn-out inquiry. The Stasi, the intelligence and security agency in the former East Germany, systematically intercepted conversations by Mr Kohl and other West German politicians during the cold war. After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, most of the agency's records were entrusted to an official body known as the Gauck authority. Ironically, Mr Kohl was the man who set up the authority and gave it responsibility for deciding who should see the highly sensitive material. For more than a year now, the former chancellor has been locked in a battle to rescue his battered reputation for posterity. He admitted last year that he had accepted donations for his Christian Democrat Union (CDU) in the 1990s, hiding their origin by having them channelled through interlocking secret bank accounts. Mr Kohl said the money was handed over to help the Christian Democratic movement establish a presence in formerly communist East Germany after reunification. Since then it has been established that during Mr Kohl's 16-year chancellorship, the CDU took millions of pounds without telling the relevant authorities, as required by a law which Mr Kohl had himself introduced. One of the Gauck authority's guiding principles is that the subject of a surveillance file or telephone interception should be the first outsider to see it. A spokeswoman said last night that, after the existence of transcripts of his conversations became known, Mr Kohl was given until the end of August to study them. It was expected that once he had completed his perusal, the documents would be thrown open for inspection by journalists and researchers. The parliamentary commission investigating the former chancellor has said it will not use the files as evidence. But it is clear that if the contents of the documents were to be made public through the media, the commission could scarcely ignore them, and the MPs running it have said they could use the information to question witnesses. The Gauck authority's spokeswoman said that Mr Kohl had failed to finish his inspection of the documents by the initial deadline. Since he had also failed to give any indication of when he intended to do so, a new deadline was recently imposed of December 31. Yesterday's petition for an injunction restraining the authority appeared to have been lodged in response to the new deadline. A spokesman for the law firm handling Mr Kohl's affairs said he had already seen the files \"two or three times\" and intended to go back and look at them again before the end of the year. Mr Kohl has repeatedly argued that the transcripts could contain distortions and inaccuracies. Stephan Holthoff-Pf\u00f6rtner, his senior lawyer, said the documents in question had come into existence \"through a gross violation of civil liberties\".",

The service acknowledged that the GP, who concealed his disciplinary record to get the post at Armley prison, had failed a remand prisoner who hanged himself. The doctor, Kumar Sitaram Singh, was criticised at an inquest on Steven Wilkinson, 39, whose resuscitation treatment was stopped on the GP's orders. A jury at Wakefield coroner's court yesterday returned a verdict of misadventure contributed to by neglect. The inquest heard that Dr Singh had \"backed away\" when called to Mr Wilkinson's cell as the doctor on sole duty in the jail. The jury was told he had not used his stethoscope or played any part in resuscitation procedures before telling police and prison staff Mr Wilkinson was dead. The inquest heard that after the tragedy it emerged that Dr Singh had not told Armley's authorities that he was under severe restrictions from the General Medical Council following complaints over the deaths of two patients at his former practice in Derbyshire. Ruth Bundey, solicitor for Mr Wilkinson's family, said that the prison had discovered that Dr Singh was undergoing extra training, but had failed to check his full GMC record. \"They would have learned much earlier than they finally did that he was barred from working single-handed and forbidden to act as a locum,\" she said. The prison service said Armley had seen a host of improvements since Mr Wilkinson's death on February 28, 1998, including the appointment of a new governor and a suicide awareness co-ordinator. Dr Singh, who did not appear at the inquest, successfully applied for voluntary removal from the register of medical practitioners a year ago.

      "body": "<p>When the newly elected Governor Jeb Bush appointed Peggy Quince to the Florida supreme court two years ago to the day yesterday, he little knew that his action might end in denying the presidency of the United States to his elder brother George.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, Justice Quince, the first black American woman to serve on the supreme court of a state which once went to war with the US in defence of slavery, added her crucial vote to those of her three more experienced colleagues, Harry Anstead, Barbara Pariente and Fred Lewis. In so doing, the four judges propelled the US down the track towards its most dramatic constitutional showdown since the American civil war nearly a century and a half ago.</p> <p>By overturning last week's circuit court ruling of Tallahassee Judge N Sanders Sauls, the 4-3 majority on the Florida Supreme Court not only revived Al Gore's presidential hopes, which almost all the American pundits had pronounced dead and buried, but also all but guaranteed that America's November 7 presidential election will not be resolved until early next year, just days before President Bill Clinton leaves office.</p> <p>The principal direct effect of yesterday's Florida supreme court decision is to order a series of recounts of disputed \"undervotes\" which the Gore camp - and many in the Bush camp too - believe will swing the bitterly contested battle for Florida towards the vice-president.</p> <p>At stake in the contest are Florida's precious 25 electoral college votes, votes which will decide whether Mr Bush or Mr Gore succeeds Mr Clinton. Mr Gore has 267 electoral college votes in his pocket. Mr Bush has 246. Whoever gets Florida's 25 votes will get past the 270 votes needed for victory.</p> <p>At 4pm yesterday, when the Florida court made its ruling, the battle for those votes went into completely uncharted territory, putting the US constitution to its greatest test of the modern era. The outcome of that battle remains unknowable.</p> <p>The court ordered that a net 383 new votes for Mr Gore that were already counted in Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties should be immediately certified as part of the Florida result. Those votes - 168 from the previously abandoned Miami-Dade recount and 215 from the recount in Palm Beach which finished too late to be certified by the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris on November 26 - reduced Mr Bush's certified lead in Florida from the previous total of 537 to a new wafer-thin margin of 154.</p> <p>The court also ordered that 9,000 still uncounted votes from Miami-Dade should now be recounted before Tuesday's deadline for nominating Florida's members of the electoral college, which is scheduled to meet to choose the next president on December 18. And it ruled that other counties may also conduct recounts of such \"undervotes\".</p> <p>The net result of these orders is that Mr Gore stands on the verge of reversing the Bush victory in Florida and claiming the White House.</p> <p>If he is to succeed in doing so, Mr Gore needs to do two things. First, he needs to defeat a likely appeal by Mr Bush to the US supreme court, which is already on a collision course with the Florida justices over their ruling of November 21, which allowed hand recounts in three counties. The Gore camp expressed confidence about that prospect last night, but the US supreme court now stands as Mr Bush's best hope of stopping the Gore revival.</p> <p>Second, Mr Gore needs to win the recounts. That, it seemed last night, could be the easy bit. The challenge Mr Gore then faces is a political and constitutional one, as the Republican Party, which until last night believed itself on the threshold of the White House, fights with all the weapons at its disposal to prevent Mr Gore from winning what would now be the most extraordinary presidential victory in US history.</p> <p>Yesterday, with the full blessing of both governors Bush, the newly elected houses of the Florida legislature - both of them Republican dominated - had already begun to debate a bill to certify the state's electoral college votes for Mr Bush. That debate goes into committee on Monday and is due to be signed into law by Jeb Bush on Wednesday.</p> <p>Such a move puts the Florida legislature on a direct collision course with the counts ordered by the state's supreme court last night. If Mr Gore emerges as the winner of the recountsFlorida could find itself with two rival sets of electors meeting in Tallahassee on December 18 - with 25 Democrats supporting Mr Gore and 25 Republicans backing Mr Bush.</p> <p>At that point the battle for the White House would move from Florida to Washington DC. The two newly elected houses of the United States Congress are due to be sworn in on January 3. In the 100-member Senate the parties are equally divided, with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats, and the casting vote is in the hands of the sitting vice-president of the United States - Al Gore.</p> <p>In the 435-member House of Representatives, the Republicans have a narrow majority of 221 to 212, with two independents. One Democratic congressman has died since the November 7 election.</p> <p>On January 5 the two houses are scheduled to meet in joint session for what is normally a purely ritual event, at which they receive the results of the electoral college voting, count the votes and declare the winners of the presidential and and vice-presidential races.</p> <p>This time, things could very easily be different. As each state announces the results of its electoral college voting any one member of the Senate or of the House can raise an objection. If that happens the joint session is brought to an end, and the two houses reconvene in separate session to settle the argument.</p> <p>According to the constitution, the House then votes on the presidency, while the Senate chooses the vice-president. In the presidential vote in the House, each state casts a single vote, reflecting the balance of that state's representation. In the case of states such as Vermont and Wyoming, which have one congressman each, the solitary congressman would have the vote to himself. In California the one vote would be cast after the state's 54 congressmen and women had voted among themselves.</p> <p>If each state voted according to its current political balance, Mr Bush would win, since more than 30 of the states have Republican majorities. Such an outcome is not a foregone conclusion, however, because the vote will also depend on the political pressures applied to congressmen as the decision day nears.</p> <p>If Mr Gore emerges from the new counts with more votes than Mr Bush in Florida, congressional Republicans will face an agonising decision on January 5. Do they cast their presidential votes for their fellow Republican or for the man who won the election? Local considerations will sway many votes.</p> <p>At least one moderate Republican, Congresswoman Connie Morella of Maryland, whose district voted heavily for Mr Gore on November 7, has already said she would find it difficult to vote for Mr Bush in those circumstances. Conversely, the conservative Mississippi \"Blue Dog\" Democrat Gene Taylor, whose district voted for Mr Bush, has said he would probably vote for Mr Bush if it came to it. The fluid loyalties of American congressional politics are likely to produce several surprises if the crisis gets that far.</p> <p>Yet, if the Congress does make the final decisions in the November 2000 election, it is possible that the biggest and most ironic surprise could come in the final outcome. If Republicans in the House succeed in voting Mr Bush in as president, Mr Gore's casting vote in the Senate could simultaneously elect Joe Lieberman as vice-president rather than Mr Bush's running-mate Dick Cheney.</p> <p>In that case, the presidential election of 2004 could be an unprecedented contest all of its own, with the sitting president Mr Bush facing a challenge from his own sitting vice-president Mr Lieberman.</p> <p><b>Key document</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/1122floridaruling.pdf\">Download the Florida supreme court ruling (pdf file)</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,400160,00.html\">Timeline - when will America decide?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,401153,00.html\">22 November: The chad debate - are dimples Gore's best hope?</a><br><br><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a><br><br><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1119vulliamy.rm\">Ed Vulliamy on Palm Beach (3mins 45)</a><br><br><b>Local media</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tdo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tallahassee Democrat</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\">Sun Sentinel</a></p>",

What will be the big business issue of the next decade? For the UK I fear it has to be our apparent inability to produce either a cadre of competent managers or some outstanding business leaders. What one lesson would you pass on to budding managers? Never to be afraid of failure if you act with integrity. Which management guru do you believe in? General Electric's Jack Welch. What is your view on British membership of EMU ? It may well be expedient for some countries to stay outside for the time being. However, the reality is more a \"when\" than an \"if\" and we should prepare for this. Who is your favourite politician ? It would have to be Disraeli for his brilliance and wit. What phrase or saying do you most overuse? I'm sure I suffer from the abuse of one word, but you'd have to ask my friends and colleagues. Apart from your family, what else makes you happiest in life? A great book. I recommend Patrick O'Brian's novels. What annoys you most? Politicians, bad service and intelligent people being incompetent. What was your last cultural experience? I keep going back to the Tate Modern. What is your favourite city? Sydney holds many marvellous memories for me. And New York is also one amazing place. Do you have a favourite website? There is a deli in Milan called Peck reflects the physical experience. For Christmas I recommend a kilo of the finest parmigiano reggiano for only \u00a316. What would you really like to have been? A submarine commander in the Royal Navy.",

So the government did what governments do in a crisis - call in the troops. The Army, with a 200-year history of training leaders and developing teamwork, was seen to have something to offer company bosses.</p> <p>Since the launch of a pilot scheme in October the response has been so overwhelming that a longer term partnership is planned.</p> <p>RMA spokesman Major Harry Emck, OBE, says: \"The Army's training is focused on experience. What you learn has to be put into practice in short order. If people are out with a few logs and a bit of rope and they have to get across a 'mined area' it does amazing things to their thinking.\"</p> <p>But the courses are not all about gung-ho machismo, and they're not boot camps either.</p> <p>What the Army has developed over two centuries is an effective chain of command, so that information is passed seamlessly down the line, everybody has a role and everybody knows what their role is and what the ultimate goal is.</p> <p>Rick Chattell MBE, project manager for MaST and a former Sandhurst cadet himself, says the Army is very good at what it calls processes.</p> <p>\"If a general issues an order it goes right down to the private who knows the circumstances and what to do with this piece of equipment.

      "bodyText": "Executives in Civvy Street might find it hard to believe, but the Army can teach them a thing or two about leadership. And now a partnership between the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and civilian specialists MaST Inspirational Development is offering unique training courses to British managers. The idea came when the Cabinet office expressed concern that lack of leadership was hindering the country's commercial success. So the government did what governments do in a crisis - call in the troops. The Army, with a 200-year history of training leaders and developing teamwork, was seen to have something to offer company bosses. Since the launch of a pilot scheme in October the response has been so overwhelming that a longer term partnership is planned. RMA spokesman Major Harry Emck, OBE, says: \"The Army's training is focused on experience. What you learn has to be put into practice in short order. If people are out with a few logs and a bit of rope and they have to get across a 'mined area' it does amazing things to their thinking.\" But the courses are not all about gung-ho machismo, and they're not boot camps either. What the Army has developed over two centuries is an effective chain of command, so that information is passed seamlessly down the line, everybody has a role and everybody knows what their role is and what the ultimate goal is. Rick Chattell MBE, project manager for MaST and a former Sandhurst cadet himself, says the Army is very good at what it calls processes. \"If a general issues an order it goes right down to the private who knows the circumstances and what to do with this piece of equipment. It's like a stick of rock with the same word all the way through. Companies are more efficient if they use such processes.\" The trouble is, in most corporations the executive echelons feed their insecurities by not sharing their overall strategy with the foot soldiers. This leaves the workforce fumbling and provides the management team with ready made scapegoats should things go awry. The MaST Inspirational Development courses start in the classroom where the styles, strengths and weaknesses of different leadership techniques are examined and the theories of inspirational leadership developed by MaST. \"It is about inspiring yourself and others to succeed,\" explains Mr Chattell. The template for success is built on leadership which involves strategic thinking and having a vision; followership which is about delegation and empowering others to build a team; and partnership which creates co-operation and cross boundary team working. Delegates also learn to think about what makes them and other people tick and analysing the different roles in a team. Then it's out on command tasks with intriguing titles such as \"bomb disposal\", \"ravine crossing\" and \"magic carpet\". These create a level playing field, says Mr Chattell, unlike a corporate situation where managers are able to use their position to mask their inadequacies . \"At Sandhurst, they can't hide behind their rank and the skills of an individual are immediately apparent,\" he adds. \"Understanding leadership theory is important, but experience of putting it into practice in a safe environment is vital.\" Delegates complete a personal action plan to use those lessons learned and can later attend a follow-up session to see how things have worked out and what new plans can be made. The first managers on the course came from investment bank UBS Warburg. Shaun Collier, project director for the 40 strong IT team, wanted to boost morale before a multi-million dollar change programme was initiated . \"The mix of theory and practical exercises offered at Sandhurst seemed to be what was required,\" he says. \"All activities were completed successfully and the sense of achievement and team constitution was remarkable by the end of the day. The team was on a high and so relished the opportunity to attempt Sandhurst's infamous assault course.\" Since their Sandhurst experience, says Mr Collier, the team has a greater appreciation of its' own constitution and the need for complementary skills. \"The team wants to go back. They still talk about it today.\" For details of MaST Inspirational Development Courses, tel RMA Sandhurst 01276 412240.",

The very phrase conjures up images of the salesman with his foot in the door, persuading confused people to sign up for services they neither want nor understand.</p> <p>But US phone company ETI, which launched in the UK last month, claims that direct sales is changing. In North America, a small but growing proportion of its representatives are younger people who view their sales job as an entrepreneurial opportunity, giving them autonomy to dictate their own lifestyle and salary. \"We even have people on our books who have given up jobs as doctors and lawyers to sell our service, rather than seeing it as a mere \"supplemental income opportunity\", claims ETI chief executive Christina Gold.</p> <p>But does she think it paradoxical that a contemporary company selling in the relatively modern field of a deregulated telecoms market should choose such an atavistic method of vending: wireless communications being sold in the same way as 19th-century insurance policies?</p> <p>\"The representatives are the heart and soul of our business,\" Ms Gold says. \"They are often selling to friends and family and so they would hardly be pushing a service they did not believe in if they were going to see their customer later that night over the dinner table. They have the confidence that the service they are selling is a good one and they like to mention the fact that we are backed by IBM because it is a name that people have heard of and trust.\"</p> <p>Ms Gold, whose background is with Avon, will not reveal what the average ETI salesperson is taking home - \"I am not allowed to tell you under US law,\" she says - but does admit that \"this is not a get rich quick business: it's up to you to make it happen.\"</p> <p>In the UK, prospective representatives must pay \u00a399 for a start-up pack and a two-hour face-to-face training programme. This is returned once the individual has signed up 10 customers.</p> <p>After that the commission is tiered according to the frequency and type of calls the customer is making: \u00a310 for an acquisition, 1% on every internet or local call, 5% on national and international ones. In the US, up to 20% of salespeople do it full time. ETI is looking to expand into wireless communications and e-commerce and the aim is to quadruple customer spend every year by cross-selling these other, more sophisticated, products.</p> <p>Other new entrant phone company's use similar tactics. Euphony also has American roots and retains a small army of people who sell the firm's services in return for a commission. The firm's sales staff are from all walks of life and trumpet the benefits of working from home and managing their own time.</p> <p>\"We were so impressed [with the service], we ended up joining the company as independent consultants,\" says Sally Keddie. \"Jim, my husband, being in his late 40s, had suffered from the modern disease called 'corporate downsizing' and when we were given the opportunity to save on our phone bill, we looked further into the company and found that they create an opening that allows people to have their own telecoms business, working from home and at your own pace.\"</p> <p>Cooperative Insurance Services sells unit trusts, life insurance, pensions and car and household insurance solely through its 4,500 home sales agents. The role of its agents has changed hugely in the past 10 years - in the early nineties they carried around reams of paper and filled in customer payment books rather than their laptops of today, and the company is currently overhauling the service its salespeople offer the customer: \"We are taking home service to another level in 2001 to recognise it as a skilled profession rather than a job,\" says Charles McKeown, general manager of the CIS sales and service areas.</p> <p>The average age of a new CIS sales recruit is 32 and increasing numbers of these are women - 9.4% of those taken on since 1999 are female against the sales force overall, of which just 4% are women - counteracting the traditional image of financial services as being a men only area. The average length of time with the CIS is 10 years and all of the sales force work full-time. The salaries are good: basic plus commission on existing policies, plus a 30% bonus for introducing an average of one new policy a week, is \u00a330,000 and Mr McKeown says that one or two are grossing more than \u00a3100,000 a year.</p> <p>There are now more than 500,000 people selling door-to-door for 100 companies. In the past three years of the 1990s, annual sales increased by 40% to \u00a31.36bn, according to the Direct Selling Association. In 1998, 113 direct selling businesses accounted for 90% of total sales.</p> <p>The market is still very much dominated by cosmetics, cleaning products and kitchenware companies, which pay low levels of commission to the salesperson. Two out of three direct salespeople are women with children, and working part-time. \"There is a nascent trend towards people selling full-time but still a lot of people have very modest earnings and don't wish to devote more than a couple of hours a day to it. No company would advise anyone to immediately give up their job to sell door-to-door,\" says director of the DSA, Richard Berry.</p> <p>But he adds that increasingly people are setting up their own sales teams under the organisational auspices of their employer, using the experience and support of the company. \"More than half the companies selling directly allow people their own sales group and then outsource the field sales to them,\" he says.</p> <p>The image of the business might have been helped with the introduction of a consumer bill designed by the department of trade and industry to clamp down on rogue traders, but earlier this month it emerged that the bill was unlikely to squeeze into the government's legislative programme. And, sure enough on Wednesday, it failed to appear in the Queen's Speech.</p> <p>The Consumers' Association says the decision to delay the bill will be \"hugely disappointing\" for consumers. Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers made some amends for the loss of his bill when he announced alternative measures to be introduced in the new year, including provisions for \"stop now\" orders. He said that one of the specific target groups of the policy were rogue doorstop sellers and the orders are an attempt to permanently prevent people from selling in illegal ways. \"Failure to comply with a 'stop now' order will be treated as a contempt in court and can be punished by a fine or imprisonment,\" he said.</p> <p>Alison Williams chairs the Field Marketing Council, part of the DSA, and is also group MD of FDS Marketing, which provides the salesforce for a portfolio of clients such as Yorkshire Electricity. \"Field marketing grew out of ladies hosting Tupperware parties but has now moved on to supplying salesforces in their entirety or supplementing those of the blue chips and utilities.\"</p> <p>She acknowledges that the industry's poor reputation has been an accurate one in the past, saying that on deregulation of the utilities, many former double-glazing salesmen were taken on without proper training. \"They did not understand that they were custodians of the client's brand,\" she says.</p> <p>She adds that each person in her sales teams has signed up to a code of practice, sells the products or services of just one client and that everyone is trained for two days. At least one in 10 visits is audited for customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Her most junior employee will take home around \u00a325,000, about half of which is commission. Some 60% of the work is selling utilities and the salespeople will cold call. There is also a career structure through which a salesperson can go on to be a team leader, area controller and finally field sales manager. \"I know selling like this has had a bad reputation in the past, but we see it as a proper career,\" she says.</p> <p><b>When the personal is what's wanted</b></p> <p>Alan Ellwood has been a CIS salesman for 15 years, covering the Islington area of London. A number of his clients are professionals who nevertheless want someone to come to their home and explain precisely how financial products work.</p> <p>\"One of my clients is a director of the Royal Society of Arts and several others are doctors.

Just to throw a spanner in the works, I added that I would agree to sell the units for \u00a3600. At that point Dresdner, which answered letters with commendable promptness and courtesy, gave in and said I could keep the units if I wanted. I did still try to pursue the question of how they could ever have been entitled to force me to sell. The best they could answer was that the regulator, Imro, was aware of it and had not blocked it. However, even after extensive inquiries, the spokes woman could not establish any legal justification for the action. This type of approach by companies is far from unique. Compulsory acquisitions such as this are a grey area. Where it involves shares, rather than unit trusts, the law - governed by the Companies Act - is even more complex. Those wanting to take a principled stand will probably find that the company gives in, as Dresdner did with me. One problem remains from taking such a stand though - my principles have left me stuck with \u00a3121 worth of useless unit trusts. Any offers? \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister.",

A Ferrari 250 GTO that came second in Le Mans in 1973 is expected to fetch $10m, about \u00a37m, when it comes to Bonhams &amp; Brooks sale of Historic Motor Cars and Automobilia at the Palace Hotel Gstaad, Switzerland on Tuesday December 19.</p> <p>Okay it is a special car. One of only 39 made, chassis 4293 GTI, this 1963 3-litre Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta Competizione not only won the vital GT category at Le Mans, but also finished second overall in the world famous French 24-hour classic race</p> <p>Enzo Ferrari always rated victory in the Le Mans Grand Touring category higher than the Formula 1 World Championship itself, apparently, so the 4293 GTI became his favourite.</p> <p>Even so, this seems a heck of a price to pay for one car. Another Ferrari in the sale, the 275 GTB, one of six built in 1965, is on offer at around \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>Moreover, as Simon Kidston, the specialist at Bonhams &amp; Brooks who is organising the Gstaad sale, says: \"By the end of the 60s the 250 GTO was selling for under the \u00a36,000 it cost when new.\"</p> <p>If prices for Ferraris had been on an unbroken vertiginously rising curve since the 60s, then to have picked up a Ferrari in the 60s would have been a very good investment indeed. Mr Kidston says he knows a man who bought two 250 GTOs in the late sixties for \u00a36,000 each. \"He sold one for \u00a310.5m in 1990, and kept the other. He was a very happy man,\" Kidston says.</p> <p>However, like other classic cars, Ferraris have been one of the biggest roller-coasters of all alternative investments - if viewed as such. Prices began to take off in the 70s when classic car road racing really got going. They rose steadily and then in the 80s were swept up in a speculative frenzy.</p> <p>Clubs and syndicates bought them purely as investments. Many cars were stored and never driven at all. It has been estimated that 80% of all classic car purchases in the 80s were by speculators. The bubble burst in 1990 with the recession of the late 80s.</p> <p>Mr Kidston says: \"By the mid-1990s the price of a 250 GTO had dropped to \u00a33m, if you call that a collapse.\" Ferraris are top of the range and the most expensive, but the phenomenon of boom and bust is common to other collected classic sports cars. Other marques sought by enthusiasts include Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Jaguar, MG, Porsche and Austin-Healey.</p> <p>Generally, but not invariably, it is post second world war models which are the most highly prized. This is because, unlike in the 80s, buyers now want cars they can drive. Until recently, enthusiasts were interested in vintage cars from earlier this century, but are less so now it seems.</p> <p>An auction last weekend, also held by Bonhams &amp; Brooks, at London's Olympia, made the point about prices. Part of a three-day (December 2 to 4) extravaganza of motorcycles, toys and models, automobilia, aeronautica formula 1 and collectors cars, the classic car section collect had a wide range of models on offer.</p> <p>These ranged from a 1904 Turner Miesse 10hp steam car, estimated at \u00a3 50,000 to \u00a370,000, to a 1974 Rolls-Royce Camargue two-door saloon priced at \u00a317,000 to \u00a321,000.</p> <p>A very popular car when it was produced and today is the Jaguar E-Type. Prices here give an idea of the trend since 1990. A 1974 Jaguar E-Type V-12 Series was on offer at \u00a324,000 to \u00a326,000. Rebecca Ruff at Bonhams &amp; Brooks reckons at the height of the boom this model would have sold for at least \u00a360,000.</p> <p>The pattern is repeated at the cheaper end of the sports car market. Richard Ladds, at the MG Owners Club, says that an MGB roadster made in the late 70s would probably have cost a few thousand, rose to around \u00a315,000 during the boom and has fallen back to something like \u00a310,000 now.</p> <p>The overall picture is that although across the range classic cars have not, and seem unlikely to, reach the inflated prices of the late 80s, there is again a steady market for cars with prices rising solidly. Mr Kidston says that now it is people in their 30s and upwards who want cars to drive on the roads. They are more discerning than during the speculative times. \"We are no longer invoicing cars to leasing companies,\" he says.</p> <p>For further information telephone <a href=\"http://www.bonhams.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Bonhams &amp; Brooks</a> (020 7393 3900), Simon Kidston Bonhams &amp; Brooks Europe 00 41 22 300 3160 and MG Owners Club 01954 231125.</p>",

Okay it is a special car. One of only 39 made, chassis 4293 GTI, this 1963 3-litre Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta Competizione not only won the vital GT category at Le Mans, but also finished second overall in the world famous French 24-hour classic race Enzo Ferrari always rated victory in the Le Mans Grand Touring category higher than the Formula 1 World Championship itself, apparently, so the 4293 GTI became his favourite. Even so, this seems a heck of a price to pay for one car. Another Ferrari in the sale, the 275 GTB, one of six built in 1965, is on offer at around \u00a3100,000. Moreover, as Simon Kidston, the specialist at Bonhams &amp; Brooks who is organising the Gstaad sale, says: \"By the end of the 60s the 250 GTO was selling for under the \u00a36,000 it cost when new.\" If prices for Ferraris had been on an unbroken vertiginously rising curve since the 60s, then to have picked up a Ferrari in the 60s would have been a very good investment indeed. Mr Kidston says he knows a man who bought two 250 GTOs in the late sixties for \u00a36,000 each. \"He sold one for \u00a310.5m in 1990, and kept the other. He was a very happy man,\" Kidston says. However, like other classic cars, Ferraris have been one of the biggest roller-coasters of all alternative investments - if viewed as such. Prices began to take off in the 70s when classic car road racing really got going. They rose steadily and then in the 80s were swept up in a speculative frenzy. Clubs and syndicates bought them purely as investments. Many cars were stored and never driven at all. It has been estimated that 80% of all classic car purchases in the 80s were by speculators. The bubble burst in 1990 with the recession of the late 80s. Mr Kidston says: \"By the mid-1990s the price of a 250 GTO had dropped to \u00a33m, if you call that a collapse.\" Ferraris are top of the range and the most expensive, but the phenomenon of boom and bust is common to other collected classic sports cars. Other marques sought by enthusiasts include Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Jaguar, MG, Porsche and Austin-Healey. Generally, but not invariably, it is post second world war models which are the most highly prized. This is because, unlike in the 80s, buyers now want cars they can drive. Until recently, enthusiasts were interested in vintage cars from earlier this century, but are less so now it seems. An auction last weekend, also held by Bonhams &amp; Brooks, at London's Olympia, made the point about prices. Part of a three-day (December 2 to 4) extravaganza of motorcycles, toys and models, automobilia, aeronautica formula 1 and collectors cars, the classic car section collect had a wide range of models on offer. These ranged from a 1904 Turner Miesse 10hp steam car, estimated at \u00a3 50,000 to \u00a370,000, to a 1974 Rolls-Royce Camargue two-door saloon priced at \u00a317,000 to \u00a321,000. A very popular car when it was produced and today is the Jaguar E-Type. Prices here give an idea of the trend since 1990. A 1974 Jaguar E-Type V-12 Series was on offer at \u00a324,000 to \u00a326,000. Rebecca Ruff at Bonhams &amp; Brooks reckons at the height of the boom this model would have sold for at least \u00a360,000. The pattern is repeated at the cheaper end of the sports car market. Richard Ladds, at the MG Owners Club, says that an MGB roadster made in the late 70s would probably have cost a few thousand, rose to around \u00a315,000 during the boom and has fallen back to something like \u00a310,000 now. The overall picture is that although across the range classic cars have not, and seem unlikely to, reach the inflated prices of the late 80s, there is again a steady market for cars with prices rising solidly. Mr Kidston says that now it is people in their 30s and upwards who want cars to drive on the roads. They are more discerning than during the speculative times. \"We are no longer invoicing cars to leasing companies,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>As we enter the last lap of the Guardian/Barnardo's \u00a310,000 Investment Challenge, leading the way is one of the frontrunners throughout the year, Shivani Parikh of Liverpool.</p> <p>Ms Parikh's selection of five funds tops the more than 4,000 entries into the Challenge - but only by a whisker. Her portfolio, named \"Shining Shivani\" is up 8.1% since the start of the year, compared to the second-placed portfolio, \"Thomas\", entered by Mr Decher of south-west London, which is ahead 7.8%. As the table below shows, there are several other portfolios which are also close to catching Shining Shivani.</p> <p>Ms Parikh, 25, says she spent a long time studying the funds when we began inviting entries to the Challenge last year. She is a trainee actuary at Royal Liver friendly society, so is no stranger to how investment markets work.</p> <p>All now depends on how investment markets behave during December - and anything could happen, if November's experience is anything to go by. During the month, stockmarkets around the world fell sharply, driven down by heavy selling of technology stocks.</p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money readers who had entered portfolios geared towards technology funds had been early leaders in the Challenge, but they have now fallen back. Most of the people on the leader board picked European-invested funds, which are among the few to show positive gains on the year.</p> <p>If there is a tie at the end of the competition the winner will be the one who also most accurately forecast the level of the FTSE 100 at the end of 2000. Here Ms Parikh could be in trouble; she has forecast a year-end FTSE 100 of 7,510, compared to the 6,300 level at which it is currently trading. In the current top 10, FTSE 100 forecasts range from 6,700, predicted by \"Ruth Davies\" to 7,555 by the \"South Coast Trust\".</p> <p>The biggest winner, however, will be children's charity Barnardo's. Each of the 52 funds entered into the Challenge has pledged to invest \u00a350 per month into their funds over three years, which - markets permitting - should result in Barnardo's collecting around \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>The table below shows how each of the funds is progressing so far - but the results don't make happy reading. Of the 52 funds entered into the Challenge, only 14 are in positive territory after 11 months, hit by the turmoil that has engulfed stock mar kets this year. At the beginning of the year, when the Challenge began, the FTSE 100 was around the 7,000 level, 10% above today's level, so any fund keeping its head above water is doing well.</p> <p>Topping the table is Credit Suisse's Transatlantic fund, up 16.7%. The \u00a3410m fund is one of the best-performing North American-invested unit trusts currently available to UK investors; over the past five years it has made an astonishing 234% on the back of the booming US economy.</p> <p>It has managed to stay ahead this year when its peers have stumbled (the average North American fund is up only 1-2% this year) by steering clear of the frothiest technology stocks and focusing on stable multinationals. It has also avoided investing in banks and other financial stocks, which it believes are currently overvalued.</p> <p>Joint second place goes to Jupiter's UK Growth trust, which is up 10.2%, tied with Norwich Union's Property trust. Jupiter's performance is of special note on three counts. Firstly, it has achieved 10.2% growth at a time when the average UK invested unit trust is down by 5%. Secondly, it comes after a period of management turmoil at Jupiter but which has clearly had no effect on its continued performance.</p> <p>And thirdly, the growth has been achieved by a large fund, \u00a3715m in size, which investment experts usually say are much less nimble during difficult market conditions. Four of the 14 funds with positive gains on the year are Europe-invested, although another area which has reaped rewards for investors is the bond fund arena, which tends to be less volatile and lower risk than equity funds.</p> <p>The money raised from the Challenge will help Barnardo's support more people like Joanne Rhodes, 22, of Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Joanne went into care aged two and then through a succession of residential homes and foster families until she set out on an independent life at the age of 17.</p> <p>Making the leap into adulthood without the support of a family background is one of the biggest challenges for teenagers in care, and Joanne benefited from a Barnardo's project called the Signpost centre, operated in partnership with Wakefield Metropolitan District housing and social care departments.</p> <p>Signpost provides support to encourage moves to independence for care leavers aged 16-21, plus a stopover scheme offering emergency and short-term accommodation to homeless young people aged 16-21. It also has a parent and toddler group for young parents and mediation/counselling services.</p> <p>Joanne became involved with Signpost after she was made redundant and through the assistance of workers at the project was able to get herself back into education. She is now studying for A-levels and eventually wants to complete a degree in social care.</p> <p>In the meantime she has set up her own project, called Friends, which counsels teenagers from ages 13 to 18 in residential homes. The project has been helped with a \u00a35,000 grant from Barnardo's.</p> <p>Joanne says: \"We deal with relationship and personal problems, let-downs from placements and foster families and so on. I've been through it myself, seen it and come through it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As we enter the last lap of the Guardian/Barnardo's \u00a310,000 Investment Challenge, leading the way is one of the frontrunners throughout the year, Shivani Parikh of Liverpool. Ms Parikh's selection of five funds tops the more than 4,000 entries into the Challenge - but only by a whisker. Her portfolio, named \"Shining Shivani\" is up 8.1% since the start of the year, compared to the second-placed portfolio, \"Thomas\", entered by Mr Decher of south-west London, which is ahead 7.8%. As the table below shows, there are several other portfolios which are also close to catching Shining Shivani. Ms Parikh, 25, says she spent a long time studying the funds when we began inviting entries to the Challenge last year. She is a trainee actuary at Royal Liver friendly society, so is no stranger to how investment markets work. All now depends on how investment markets behave during December - and anything could happen, if November's experience is anything to go by. During the month, stockmarkets around the world fell sharply, driven down by heavy selling of technology stocks. Jobs &amp; Money readers who had entered portfolios geared towards technology funds had been early leaders in the Challenge, but they have now fallen back. Most of the people on the leader board picked European-invested funds, which are among the few to show positive gains on the year. If there is a tie at the end of the competition the winner will be the one who also most accurately forecast the level of the FTSE 100 at the end of 2000. Here Ms Parikh could be in trouble; she has forecast a year-end FTSE 100 of 7,510, compared to the 6,300 level at which it is currently trading. In the current top 10, FTSE 100 forecasts range from 6,700, predicted by \"Ruth Davies\" to 7,555 by the \"South Coast Trust\". The biggest winner, however, will be children's charity Barnardo's. Each of the 52 funds entered into the Challenge has pledged to invest \u00a350 per month into their funds over three years, which - markets permitting - should result in Barnardo's collecting around \u00a3100,000. The table below shows how each of the funds is progressing so far - but the results don't make happy reading. Of the 52 funds entered into the Challenge, only 14 are in positive territory after 11 months, hit by the turmoil that has engulfed stock mar kets this year. At the beginning of the year, when the Challenge began, the FTSE 100 was around the 7,000 level, 10% above today's level, so any fund keeping its head above water is doing well. Topping the table is Credit Suisse's Transatlantic fund, up 16.7%. The \u00a3410m fund is one of the best-performing North American-invested unit trusts currently available to UK investors; over the past five years it has made an astonishing 234% on the back of the booming US economy. It has managed to stay ahead this year when its peers have stumbled (the average North American fund is up only 1-2% this year) by steering clear of the frothiest technology stocks and focusing on stable multinationals. It has also avoided investing in banks and other financial stocks, which it believes are currently overvalued. Joint second place goes to Jupiter's UK Growth trust, which is up 10.2%, tied with Norwich Union's Property trust. Jupiter's performance is of special note on three counts. Firstly, it has achieved 10.2% growth at a time when the average UK invested unit trust is down by 5%. Secondly, it comes after a period of management turmoil at Jupiter but which has clearly had no effect on its continued performance. And thirdly, the growth has been achieved by a large fund, \u00a3715m in size, which investment experts usually say are much less nimble during difficult market conditions. Four of the 14 funds with positive gains on the year are Europe-invested, although another area which has reaped rewards for investors is the bond fund arena, which tends to be less volatile and lower risk than equity funds. The money raised from the Challenge will help Barnardo's support more people like Joanne Rhodes, 22, of Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Joanne went into care aged two and then through a succession of residential homes and foster families until she set out on an independent life at the age of 17. Making the leap into adulthood without the support of a family background is one of the biggest challenges for teenagers in care, and Joanne benefited from a Barnardo's project called the Signpost centre, operated in partnership with Wakefield Metropolitan District housing and social care departments. Signpost provides support to encourage moves to independence for care leavers aged 16-21, plus a stopover scheme offering emergency and short-term accommodation to homeless young people aged 16-21. It also has a parent and toddler group for young parents and mediation/counselling services. Joanne became involved with Signpost after she was made redundant and through the assistance of workers at the project was able to get herself back into education. She is now studying for A-levels and eventually wants to complete a degree in social care. In the meantime she has set up her own project, called Friends, which counsels teenagers from ages 13 to 18 in residential homes. The project has been helped with a \u00a35,000 grant from Barnardo's. Joanne says: \"We deal with relationship and personal problems, let-downs from placements and foster families and so on. I've been through it myself, seen it and come through it.\"",

Books at Waterstone's are held at the publishers' risk and are fully returnable. Many of the publishers, who have received demands at short notice for major increases in discounts that would be unacceptable to any industry, are highly-respected entrepreneurial publishers in subject areas ranging from academic texts to original fiction. These are not amateurs who cannot differentiate between profit and loss, or who expect to be subsidised by booksellers.</p> <p>Characterising independent publishers as being resentful of the rules of the market is disingenuous.

      "bodyText": "Paul Bowes (Letters, December 5) defends Waterstone's demands regarding terms of supply on the grounds that some small publishers are \"amateurish\" and \"greedy\". This sort of misinformation is totally misleading. Books at Waterstone's are held at the publishers' risk and are fully returnable. Many of the publishers, who have received demands at short notice for major increases in discounts that would be unacceptable to any industry, are highly-respected entrepreneurial publishers in subject areas ranging from academic texts to original fiction. These are not amateurs who cannot differentiate between profit and loss, or who expect to be subsidised by booksellers. Characterising independent publishers as being resentful of the rules of the market is disingenuous. Successful independent publishers have an in-depth knowledge of their market.

      "bodyText": "In the mid-70s, I sought to revive the republican movement first created by Oliver Cromwell - albeit less forcefully and ruthlessly, but with equal conviction that the monarchy should be democratically abolished. The organisation was called the Leveller Society after the Levellers, led by John Lilburne, who found wide support among Cromwell's army together with farmers, artisans and small traders. The society did not exist even as long as the short-lived Levellers - not that there was any shortage of member applications. But on close inspection, some 90% of the would-be activists proved to be senior civil servants, high-ranking army and police officers, members of the Special Branch, a couple of private secretaries in royal employ and some of my best friends at MI5. Swamped by such keenly interested consociates, the society was clearly before its time. But times are changing rapidly and I wish you much luck in your challenge. Ray Bellisario Norwood Green, Middx \u0095 Absolutely wonderful. Get rid of the monarchy. Far from being ambassadors of our country, they are ridiculed and loathed by most. The pomp and ceremony is pointless. Just another expense for taxpayers who have no interest in a dysfunctional family. They irritate me beyond belief. The Queen Mother, for example, was the first woman to receive a degree from the Senate House at Cambridge. Women worked damn hard for decades to get this right, and the first degree went to HM - never having done anything intellectual in her life. Maybe we should act on the events of 1649 and start a revolution. Verity Worthington Cambridge",

      "body": "<p>Ghanaians appear to have turned their backs on almost two decades of charismatic but controversial rule by President Jerry Rawlings who some say saved his country and whom others accuse of selling it out to western economic ideology.</p> <p>Early results from Thursday's presidential and parliamentary elections point to a victory for the opposition New Patriotic party (NPP) and its candidate, John Kufuor.</p> <p>Mr Rawlings had hoped that his own vice-president, John Atta Mills, would succeed him but if the initial returns are indicative, the candidate of the ruling National Democratic Congress will be lucky to make it to a run-off for the presidency. At least two cabinet ministers lost their seats.</p> <p>With ballots counted in 53 of 200 constituencies, Mr Kuffuor had 58% of the vote, compared to 38% for Mr Atta Mills.</p> <p>The opposition was expected to do well in the cities, where dissatisfaction with Mr Rawlings first surfaced, but initial results from rural areas indicate that the NPP has done much better there than predicted. Early returns showed that nearly half the seats taken by the opposition were previously held by the government.</p> <p>Mr Rawlings has repeatedly said that he will abide by the constitution and step down at the end of his second term as an elected president, but one factor contributing to his vice-president's defeat may be the perception in Ghana that he would rule through the back door if Mr Atta Mills won.</p> <p>Neither of the main candidates has inspired Ghanaians in what has been dubbed \"the battle of the bores\", but that hardly matters as their policies are not what is being put to the test. The election was very much a referendum on Mr Rawlings's rule which has seen him lead Ghana from an at times brutal, left-leaning military dictatorship to a darling of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and, hence, western governments.</p> <p>While Ghanaians are nearly unanimous in saying that the country is better off than it was two decades ago, there is considerable disillusionment with 17 years of structural adjustment programmes which have failed to stave off an economic crisis partly caused by a world collapse in cocoa and gold prices.</p> <p>Many suspect that reforms portrayed as transforming the west African state into one of the best and freest economies and political systems on the continent have really amounted to selling out the country to foreign financiers with limited benefits to its people.</p> <p>There is also a weariness with corruption and with 21 years of Jerry Rawlings. He first seized power as a 32-year-old fighter pilot in a coup in 1979. His ruling armed forces revolutionary council had eight generals executed in three months of frantic but popular rule before handing power to a hurriedly elected president.</p> <p>Civilian government failed, due to incompetence and corruption, and 30 months later, Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings was back to stay with a broadly socialist programme. But three years later, with the economy sinking fast, Ghana turned to the World Bank and IMF.</p> <p>Western governments poured in more than \u00a33bn of aid, allowing the government to rebuild many social institutions and contain corruption.</p> <p>Flt-Lieut Rawlings finally stood for election eight years ago in a ballot the opposition alleged was rigged. It made the same accusation over his re-election in 1996, but he seemed to retain much popularity until the economy faltered.</p> <p>Mr Kufuor, 61, ran against Mr Rawlings in 1996. He is seen as having run a vigorous campaign despite a lack of resources, particularly by venturing into the ruling NDC's rural strongholds to overturn his party's urbanite image.</p> <p>A lawyer who studied at Oxford, Mr Kufuor was Ghana's deputy foreign minister at the age of 30.

      "bodyText": "Ghanaians appear to have turned their backs on almost two decades of charismatic but controversial rule by President Jerry Rawlings who some say saved his country and whom others accuse of selling it out to western economic ideology. Early results from Thursday's presidential and parliamentary elections point to a victory for the opposition New Patriotic party (NPP) and its candidate, John Kufuor. Mr Rawlings had hoped that his own vice-president, John Atta Mills, would succeed him but if the initial returns are indicative, the candidate of the ruling National Democratic Congress will be lucky to make it to a run-off for the presidency. At least two cabinet ministers lost their seats. With ballots counted in 53 of 200 constituencies, Mr Kuffuor had 58% of the vote, compared to 38% for Mr Atta Mills. The opposition was expected to do well in the cities, where dissatisfaction with Mr Rawlings first surfaced, but initial results from rural areas indicate that the NPP has done much better there than predicted. Early returns showed that nearly half the seats taken by the opposition were previously held by the government. Mr Rawlings has repeatedly said that he will abide by the constitution and step down at the end of his second term as an elected president, but one factor contributing to his vice-president's defeat may be the perception in Ghana that he would rule through the back door if Mr Atta Mills won. Neither of the main candidates has inspired Ghanaians in what has been dubbed \"the battle of the bores\", but that hardly matters as their policies are not what is being put to the test. The election was very much a referendum on Mr Rawlings's rule which has seen him lead Ghana from an at times brutal, left-leaning military dictatorship to a darling of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and, hence, western governments. While Ghanaians are nearly unanimous in saying that the country is better off than it was two decades ago, there is considerable disillusionment with 17 years of structural adjustment programmes which have failed to stave off an economic crisis partly caused by a world collapse in cocoa and gold prices. Many suspect that reforms portrayed as transforming the west African state into one of the best and freest economies and political systems on the continent have really amounted to selling out the country to foreign financiers with limited benefits to its people. There is also a weariness with corruption and with 21 years of Jerry Rawlings. He first seized power as a 32-year-old fighter pilot in a coup in 1979. His ruling armed forces revolutionary council had eight generals executed in three months of frantic but popular rule before handing power to a hurriedly elected president. Civilian government failed, due to incompetence and corruption, and 30 months later, Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings was back to stay with a broadly socialist programme. But three years later, with the economy sinking fast, Ghana turned to the World Bank and IMF. Western governments poured in more than \u00a33bn of aid, allowing the government to rebuild many social institutions and contain corruption. Flt-Lieut Rawlings finally stood for election eight years ago in a ballot the opposition alleged was rigged. It made the same accusation over his re-election in 1996, but he seemed to retain much popularity until the economy faltered. Mr Kufuor, 61, ran against Mr Rawlings in 1996. He is seen as having run a vigorous campaign despite a lack of resources, particularly by venturing into the ruling NDC's rural strongholds to overturn his party's urbanite image. A lawyer who studied at Oxford, Mr Kufuor was Ghana's deputy foreign minister at the age of 30. He dropped out of politics after a military coup, but served briefly as secretary for local government after Mr Rawlings seized power.

A transfer can take anything from a few weeks to months.\" If you don't remember amything else ... If you are unhappy in your job, do something about it. Have the courage to discuss it with your manager, but don't make any rash decisions like handing in your notice.",

      "body": "<p>Much of the time the two wings of the British press are writing about two summits. The Eurosceptic newspapers either report stories which never appear in the Euro-supportive press, or apply their particular agendas to stories everyone is covering. </p> <p>The Euro enthusiasts stick to the central issues of the Nice summit, ignoring or burying the more tangential matters that so interest the sceptics. </p> <p>Often, particularly among the broadsheets, the pre-summit reporting of the pro-Euros has been more a matter of duty than great interest. They have gone into setpiece mode - Nice is clearly important; their preview pages showing tables of where the various member states stand on the contentious issues - rather than what they enjoy doing. Is that the underlying problem with the European project? That the believers know they are right, but can't get that excited, while the sceptics know they are right, and feel very passionate about it? </p> <p>We have been told repeatedly, by both sides, that this is the most important summit since Maastricht, and yet it is not the subject of conversation outside the London political classes. The defining, if glib, question comes down to this: is qualified majority voting sexy? Does voting weight turn you on? </p> <p>This why the Mail is so keen on uniforms. You can run a picture of fighting men with guns; not so easy with a qualified majority vote. Perhaps that is why the Guardian, in the two days preceding the summit, gave more pages to the new republicanism it was outing in Britain than it had given to the impending Euro summit in weeks. </p> <p>Relief was palpable in most of the press that the few days building up to the summit were dominated by the murder of Damilola Taylor in Peckham and the unveiling of the government's programme for the last session of parliament. </p> <p>Euro silliness reigned in the sceptic press. The Sunday Telegraph had a new threat: \"British taxpayers will be forced to bail out countries suffering economic problems because of their membership of the European single currency, under an EU reform to be accepted by Tony Blair at this week's Nice summit.\" </p> <p>But we aren't members of the single currency, are we? And anyway the Sunday Telegraph went on to say that this policy would apply when a member state was \"seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control.\" Hardly the same as the implied welfare payments to French citizens after a collapse of their balance of payments. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday wrapped itself in the flag, claiming that Downing Street was at the centre of a storm over a Whitehall order to fly the EU flag over Number 10 alongside the union flag. Read on, and you found that this was to be for one day only, Europe Day. But the Mail invited its readers to sign a petition and send it to the government. </p> <p>The same paper gave a page to Lady Annabel Goldsmith, widow of Sir James who led the Referendum party's campaign at the last general election. She spoke of her husband's pain on the hustings, and his dying wish that Britain should remain free. As summit previews go it seemed tangential. </p> <p>The Sun found \"high-handed Romano Prodi\" in his \"sumptuous newly refurbished Brussels office\". The EU commission president apparently tore into Mr Blair, and branded himself an emperor. Nobody else seemed much interested. </p> <p>After this sustained drip drip of Euro trivia, the Big Issue returned in the form of the US defence secretary, William Cohen, saying in his valedictory address to Nato that the proposed European rapid reaction force could turn Nato into a \"relic of history\" and fatally sideline the 50-year-old alliance. The previous day the Telegraph had described the government as \"reeling from the public outcry over Britain's role in the new 60,000-man force\". In fact, the previous week there had been reports that the US was comfortable with the EU plans, and there was little evidence of public outcry. </p> <p>But Mr Cohen's intervention allowed the Mail to launch a new onslaught on Mr Blair, describing him as economical with the truth - \"Now who's fundamentally dishonest Mr Blair?\", throwing back at him the PM's earlier assault on the sceptic press over the rapid reaction force. The government was on the back foot again. The Guardian reported that Mr Cohen's remarks were directed at the French. </p> <p>Mr Blair left for Nice, still maintaining that there would be no standing army, and that strategy would remain with Nato. Within hours President Jacques Chirac was confirming that the French view of the rapid reaction force was radically different from that portrayed by Britain. Summit politics were under way, for a long, long weekend. </p> <p>Peter Cole is professor of journalism at the University of Sheffield.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Much of the time the two wings of the British press are writing about two summits. The Eurosceptic newspapers either report stories which never appear in the Euro-supportive press, or apply their particular agendas to stories everyone is covering. The Euro enthusiasts stick to the central issues of the Nice summit, ignoring or burying the more tangential matters that so interest the sceptics. Often, particularly among the broadsheets, the pre-summit reporting of the pro-Euros has been more a matter of duty than great interest. They have gone into setpiece mode - Nice is clearly important; their preview pages showing tables of where the various member states stand on the contentious issues - rather than what they enjoy doing. Is that the underlying problem with the European project? That the believers know they are right, but can't get that excited, while the sceptics know they are right, and feel very passionate about it? We have been told repeatedly, by both sides, that this is the most important summit since Maastricht, and yet it is not the subject of conversation outside the London political classes. The defining, if glib, question comes down to this: is qualified majority voting sexy? Does voting weight turn you on? This why the Mail is so keen on uniforms. You can run a picture of fighting men with guns; not so easy with a qualified majority vote. Perhaps that is why the Guardian, in the two days preceding the summit, gave more pages to the new republicanism it was outing in Britain than it had given to the impending Euro summit in weeks. Relief was palpable in most of the press that the few days building up to the summit were dominated by the murder of Damilola Taylor in Peckham and the unveiling of the government's programme for the last session of parliament. Euro silliness reigned in the sceptic press. The Sunday Telegraph had a new threat: \"British taxpayers will be forced to bail out countries suffering economic problems because of their membership of the European single currency, under an EU reform to be accepted by Tony Blair at this week's Nice summit.\" But we aren't members of the single currency, are we? And anyway the Sunday Telegraph went on to say that this policy would apply when a member state was \"seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control.\" Hardly the same as the implied welfare payments to French citizens after a collapse of their balance of payments. The Mail on Sunday wrapped itself in the flag, claiming that Downing Street was at the centre of a storm over a Whitehall order to fly the EU flag over Number 10 alongside the union flag. Read on, and you found that this was to be for one day only, Europe Day. But the Mail invited its readers to sign a petition and send it to the government. The same paper gave a page to Lady Annabel Goldsmith, widow of Sir James who led the Referendum party's campaign at the last general election. She spoke of her husband's pain on the hustings, and his dying wish that Britain should remain free. As summit previews go it seemed tangential. The Sun found \"high-handed Romano Prodi\" in his \"sumptuous newly refurbished Brussels office\". The EU commission president apparently tore into Mr Blair, and branded himself an emperor. Nobody else seemed much interested. After this sustained drip drip of Euro trivia, the Big Issue returned in the form of the US defence secretary, William Cohen, saying in his valedictory address to Nato that the proposed European rapid reaction force could turn Nato into a \"relic of history\" and fatally sideline the 50-year-old alliance. The previous day the Telegraph had described the government as \"reeling from the public outcry over Britain's role in the new 60,000-man force\". In fact, the previous week there had been reports that the US was comfortable with the EU plans, and there was little evidence of public outcry. But Mr Cohen's intervention allowed the Mail to launch a new onslaught on Mr Blair, describing him as economical with the truth - \"Now who's fundamentally dishonest Mr Blair?\", throwing back at him the PM's earlier assault on the sceptic press over the rapid reaction force. The government was on the back foot again. The Guardian reported that Mr Cohen's remarks were directed at the French. Mr Blair left for Nice, still maintaining that there would be no standing army, and that strategy would remain with Nato. Within hours President Jacques Chirac was confirming that the French view of the rapid reaction force was radically different from that portrayed by Britain. Summit politics were under way, for a long, long weekend. Peter Cole is professor of journalism at the University of Sheffield.",

      "bodyText": "The real Prince of Wales stood outside the Rovers Return in a downpour yesterday in the company of a fictional teenage mum and a junior member of the yob tendency. The rain was real, too. But was it falling on the set of Coronation Street in Manchester, or on the most famous boozer in Weatherfield? As the real world collided with Britain's best-loved soap opera, celebrating its 40th birthday, the prince looked increasingly bemused. He seemed happy enough unveiling a plaque, because that is the sort of thing royals do. But as he pulled the string on the burgundy curtain and tried not to look down the cleavage of zebra-coated Linda Baldwin, he realised that he was being sucked into the plot. So in last night's special hour-long live episode, Rovers regulars were due to see on the telly in the bar a report on the prince's visit to Manchester. Pictures showed him at the new shopping centre in the old corn exchange (perfectly true), but they also showed him meeting councillor Audrey Roberts at the opening of Weatherfield's new council offices (total fiction). It was like something out of Pirandello. He went along with it like a trouper. \"The prince has agreed to the appearance because he thinks it's a lot of fun,\" confided a palace aide. \"He knows a lot of the characters and quite likes them.\" After the royal walkabout, William Roache, who has played Ken Barlow since Adam was a lad (as they say in Weatherfield), said: \"It's very thrilling with Charles coming here. He is so warm, so friendly and he's in the show.\"",

It's something of a historical-futuristic-farcical grown-up romantic musical adventure for children, and even that sells it a bit short.

Yet for all this it still retains the clarity of a fairy tale: Good Uncle Martin has invented a time-machine and Wicked Uncle Lucas wants to get his hands on it, so nine-year-old Emily - winningly portrayed by Alison Pargeter - must journey to the end of time to ensure that evil does not prevail. </p> <p>She picks up three travelling companions from various eras along the way: a chipper cockney, a sensitive android and a friendly Yeti, who unobtrusively assume the roles of Emily's own Scarecrow, Tin-Man and Cowardly Lion. The whole ensemble is excellent, but perhaps Gavin Lee stands out as Oscar, the ARP warden, because he contributes the splendid pearly-king choreography as well. </p> <p>There will be no finer family entertainment this Christmas - this could take bookings up to the 71st century. </p> <p>Until January 6.

Ayckbourn has always enjoyed shuffling his theatrical cards, but this one truly defies catagorisation. It's something of a historical-futuristic-farcical grown-up romantic musical adventure for children, and even that sells it a bit short. Above all it is an effortless demonstration that theatre can take you anywhere, particularly in the presence of children, who have far fewer inhibitions about where they might be going. Whenever trades in the kind of complexity that will have the Harry Potter generation sagely explaining the significance of it all to their parents and teachers on the way out of the theatre. Yet for all this it still retains the clarity of a fairy tale: Good Uncle Martin has invented a time-machine and Wicked Uncle Lucas wants to get his hands on it, so nine-year-old Emily - winningly portrayed by Alison Pargeter - must journey to the end of time to ensure that evil does not prevail. She picks up three travelling companions from various eras along the way: a chipper cockney, a sensitive android and a friendly Yeti, who unobtrusively assume the roles of Emily's own Scarecrow, Tin-Man and Cowardly Lion. The whole ensemble is excellent, but perhaps Gavin Lee stands out as Oscar, the ARP warden, because he contributes the splendid pearly-king choreography as well. There will be no finer family entertainment this Christmas - this could take bookings up to the 71st century. Until January 6. Box office: 01723 370541.",

      "body": "<p>\"You'll just have to lump it.\" That was about the sum of Equitable Life's message to its 650,000 policyholders yesterday after the biggest catastrophe to hit a pensions company in many, many years. </p> <p>For it to hit a company that until this year was widely regarded as the most efficient, low-charging and best performing in the industry is all the more shocking. </p> <p>Behind it lies a litany of mismanagement, incompetence and recklessness at a mutual that hitherto had occupied the industry's moral high ground and scornfully brushed aside any criticisms. </p> <p>Just 12 months ago Equitable was privately briefing followers that the scale of its unreserved liabilities were probably no more than \u00a350m, or perhaps \u00a3200m at the most. But its marketing gimmick of the 1980s, in which it gave guarantees on annuities, has backfired phenomenally and landed the company in the crisis it is in today. Even yesterday it was sticking with a liability figure of \u00a31.5bn, but as potential buyers have peeled away, culminating in Prudential's exit, estimates of the true depth of the hole in Equitable's accounts are getting very black indeed. Some even put it as high as \u00a37.5bn. </p> <p>As Equitable insists, the company is not insolvent - but only because it will now take urgent action to rectify its position, by selling shares and buying gilts so it can meet future liabilities. </p> <p>The price will be paid by policyholders. They face a triple whammy of a 10% penalty if they move, the loss of growth on their policies for seven months of this year and lower returns in future. </p> <p>A bank in a similar situation would see a queue round the block as customers sought to rescue their cash. But Equitable has in effect already locked the doors. Yes, you can have your money back - but we'll knock 10% off first, it is saying. For someone with \u00a3250,000 in pension savings - not uncommon among Equitable's blue chip customer base - that adds up to \u00a325,000, which for most will be a pill too bitter to swallow. </p> <p>Equitable is able to do this by using the \"market value adjuster,\" effectively a get-out-of-jail-free card that sits in all pension policies from all companies, but is supposed to be used only in extreme stockmarket circumstances, such as a severe market collapse. </p> <p>The most bitter customers will be those who have already taken their pension, and bought an Equitable with-profits annuity with the proceeds. These were sold with an assumed future bonus rate as high as 10% a year, which will now inexorably fall. These pensioners do not even have the option to take the 10% penalty and switch elsewhere, as the rules of annuity contracts mean you are locked in until the day you die. </p> <p>To say that the management was incompetent is probably a little soft. Policyholders will be wondering out loud why it took until yesterday for Alan Nash, the chief executive, to fall on his sword, and will probably have little faith that the finance director has now taken over the reins. </p> <p>The origins of Equitable's downfall go back further than the House of Lords ruling earlier this year. Throughout the 1990s Equitable maintained a free asset ratio - its cushion against things going wrong - startlingly lower than the rest of the industry. By doing so it was able to pay higher bonuses than rivals and carry on pulling in the punters. </p> <p>It is now emerging that as early as 1993 it took decisions about reserving that culminated in its liability problems today. The opacity of life company accounts is such that no policyholder, or, for that matter, most actuaries, would have spotted the impending disaster. </p> <p>There are, however, systems in place designed to uncover potential problems. Each life company has an appointed actuary, paid by the company but whose duty is as much to his professional body and to government supervisors as to his paymaster. They are supposed to be the whistleblower, acting on behalf of policyholders. But at no point was any whistle blown. </p> <p>What of the supervisors? Each year life companies must deliver vast amounts of financial information, until recently to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry but now the financial services authority. Questions will now be raised as to the quality of prudential supervision of Equitable, and why it was allowed to operate on a much slimmer financial cushion than comparable insurers. </p> <p>The Equitable crisis is only just starting. The company still has \u00a333bn on its books, but how much will remain in 12 months' time? No other company that has closed to new business and gone into \"run-off\" has also told its policyholders to expect significantly reduced future returns. Billions of pounds is likely to pour out of Equitable over the next few months. </p> <p>How that process is managed by Equitable and by the regulators will be the most severe of tests.</p>",

Behind it lies a litany of mismanagement, incompetence and recklessness at a mutual that hitherto had occupied the industry's moral high ground and scornfully brushed aside any criticisms. Just 12 months ago Equitable was privately briefing followers that the scale of its unreserved liabilities were probably no more than \u00a350m, or perhaps \u00a3200m at the most. But its marketing gimmick of the 1980s, in which it gave guarantees on annuities, has backfired phenomenally and landed the company in the crisis it is in today. Even yesterday it was sticking with a liability figure of \u00a31.5bn, but as potential buyers have peeled away, culminating in Prudential's exit, estimates of the true depth of the hole in Equitable's accounts are getting very black indeed. Some even put it as high as \u00a37.5bn. As Equitable insists, the company is not insolvent - but only because it will now take urgent action to rectify its position, by selling shares and buying gilts so it can meet future liabilities. The price will be paid by policyholders. They face a triple whammy of a 10% penalty if they move, the loss of growth on their policies for seven months of this year and lower returns in future. A bank in a similar situation would see a queue round the block as customers sought to rescue their cash. But Equitable has in effect already locked the doors. Yes, you can have your money back - but we'll knock 10% off first, it is saying. For someone with \u00a3250,000 in pension savings - not uncommon among Equitable's blue chip customer base - that adds up to \u00a325,000, which for most will be a pill too bitter to swallow. Equitable is able to do this by using the \"market value adjuster,\" effectively a get-out-of-jail-free card that sits in all pension policies from all companies, but is supposed to be used only in extreme stockmarket circumstances, such as a severe market collapse. The most bitter customers will be those who have already taken their pension, and bought an Equitable with-profits annuity with the proceeds. These were sold with an assumed future bonus rate as high as 10% a year, which will now inexorably fall. These pensioners do not even have the option to take the 10% penalty and switch elsewhere, as the rules of annuity contracts mean you are locked in until the day you die. To say that the management was incompetent is probably a little soft. Policyholders will be wondering out loud why it took until yesterday for Alan Nash, the chief executive, to fall on his sword, and will probably have little faith that the finance director has now taken over the reins. The origins of Equitable's downfall go back further than the House of Lords ruling earlier this year. Throughout the 1990s Equitable maintained a free asset ratio - its cushion against things going wrong - startlingly lower than the rest of the industry. By doing so it was able to pay higher bonuses than rivals and carry on pulling in the punters. It is now emerging that as early as 1993 it took decisions about reserving that culminated in its liability problems today. The opacity of life company accounts is such that no policyholder, or, for that matter, most actuaries, would have spotted the impending disaster. There are, however, systems in place designed to uncover potential problems. Each life company has an appointed actuary, paid by the company but whose duty is as much to his professional body and to government supervisors as to his paymaster. They are supposed to be the whistleblower, acting on behalf of policyholders. But at no point was any whistle blown. What of the supervisors? Each year life companies must deliver vast amounts of financial information, until recently to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry but now the financial services authority. Questions will now be raised as to the quality of prudential supervision of Equitable, and why it was allowed to operate on a much slimmer financial cushion than comparable insurers. The Equitable crisis is only just starting. The company still has \u00a333bn on its books, but how much will remain in 12 months' time? No other company that has closed to new business and gone into \"run-off\" has also told its policyholders to expect significantly reduced future returns. Billions of pounds is likely to pour out of Equitable over the next few months. How that process is managed by Equitable and by the regulators will be the most severe of tests.",
