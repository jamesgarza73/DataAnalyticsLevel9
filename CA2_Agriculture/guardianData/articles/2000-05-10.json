      "bodyText": "The Premier League is considering auctioning off its television rights in a similar way to that by which the government secured a huge windfall from the sale of mobile phone licences. Analysts believe England's leading clubs could achieve a financial bonanza worth up to \u00a32bn from the three-year contract to broadcast top-flight football from the start of the 2001-02 season. About 70 companies had requested copies of the tender document by yesterday's 5pm deadline for initial bids. The bids for the various rights packages, which will include highlights, delayed and internet rights, are traditionally made under strict confidentiality rules and presented in sealed envelopes. However, the heavy interest and the success of the recent mobile phone licence auction, which generated \u00a322.5bn, has led the league to consider alternatives. \"An auction is one of the options available to us but until the bids have been assessed in considerable detail over the next few weeks there is nothing further to say,\" a Premier League spokesman said last night. Everton's chief executive Michael Dunford said the clubs were committed to securing the best deal available. \"No one criticised the government for using this particular procedure when auctioning off new mobile phone channels,\" he said. \"No one is going to argue against doing whatever is required to secure the best possible commercial deal for Premiership clubs. Irrespective of what procedure we follow, in the end the only winners will be the clubs themselves.\" If the clubs decide to go down the auction route they will hope to see broadcasters following the example of the heavyweight mobile phone operators like One2One and Vodafone who slugged it out until only one bidder was left for each licence. Much will depend on whether BSkyB and the cable company NTL, the two favourites to win the main contract, are prepared to go head-to-head in a bidding war. There is a growing feeling in the City that the two broadcasters could strike a deal giving each access to live football and effectively putting a cap on the price of the contract. City analysts say that in that case the live rights, which in 1996 cost BSkyB \u00a3670m for a five-year term, could go for about \u00a31.2bn.",

The Malaysian businessman Jerry Lim has moved closer to sealing his takeover of Crystal Palace after contracts were exchanged on the \u00a310.6m deal yesterday. A consortium fronted by Lim should be in place by the end of the month although the club will remain in administration for the time being. Jim Smith could face a heavy fine and a possible touchline ban after being charged with misconduct for a second time this season. The charge follows comments made by Derby's manager to the referee Neale Barry during half-time of the draw against Tottenham Hotspur last month. Smith was also sent from the dugout during the match on April 29. Smith, who was charged with misconduct in December after comments to the assistant referee at the match against Manchester United, was incensed after Barry sent off Stefan Schnoor and booked five other Derby players. Tottenham, whose attempts to sign the Atletico Madrid striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink look doomed after the Dutchman said he wished to remain in Spain, could be set to lower their sights and bid for the Calais striker Mickael Gerard. According to reports in France, the 27-year-old is due to hold talks with Spurs over a \u00a31m move.

Leeds are arranging a memorial game at Elland Road, possibly against Barcelona, for the families of the two supporters who were killed in Istanbul prior to the Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray. Proceeds from the game, planned to be played in early August, will go into a trust fund set up by the club for the relatives of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight. Although details of the game are yet to be confirmed, Ridsdale has indicated that it will be against one of the top sides in Europe. \"We've had hundreds of thousands of letters sent to the club containing donations for the two families,\" he said. \u0095 The referee who controversially ruled out a late Parma equaliser against the Serie A leaders Juventus on Sunday has been summoned before the Italian football federation. Massimo de Santis's intervention ensured Juventus won 1-0 and means they go into the last round of matches this weekend with a two-point lead over Lazio, who were bitterly critical of the decision.",

      "body": "<p>Chris Schofield and Steve Harmison may be two bright young bowlers earmarked to play a big part in England's future. But, while the spinner impressed with four wickets, suggestions that Harmison is ready for a test career looked literally wide of the mark yesterday. </p> <p>However, Schofield did not have to bowl at Neil Fairbrother.

Comes to nothing. 89 Frustration for Barcelona after Figo twists and turns his way to the edge of the area only to be muscled to the ground by three Valencia players. 90 Substitution Sanchez on for Farinos. Five minutes of extra time to play as Barcelona pursue what is now a lost cause. Goal Another consolation for Barcelona after Figo drives a low cross into the box for Cocu to slide the ball past Canizares. Cocu comes close to scoring again from another Figo cross but he sees the ball drift wide of the upright as the referee Pereira calls time. Full-time: Barcelona 2 - 1 Valencia Valencia go on to face Real Madrid in the final in Paris on May 24.",

      "bodyText": "The twice-weekly slanging match of Prime Minister's Question Time is to be scrapped by Tony Blair, who confessed to hating the ordeal when he was leader of the opposition. Downing Street confirmed yesterday that it will be replaced by a half-hour session each Wednesday and that some of the ritual and antiquated language attached to it will be abandoned. Questioning of the Prime Minister began 270 years ago but it was only in 1961 that it settled into the twice-weekly formula. The first session of PMQs under the new rules - and the first with Mr Blair as Prime Minister - will be a week on Wednesday. Ann Taylor, Leader of the House, said: 'The Government is committed to reforming and modernising the House of Commons to make Parliament fit for the 21st century.' PMQs were popular with journalists and television viewers, abroad as well as at home, because of the bear-pit atmosphere. They also had an impact on backbenchers, whose morale could rise or fall according to how their leader performed. A Downing Street spokesman said the aim was to replace entertainment politics with good politics. Mr Blair telephoned John Major, the Leader of the Opposition, and Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, to inform them of the change. Mr Major criticised Mr Blair for imposing the change without consulation. He said question time was a burden to any prime minister 'but that is the point of it'. He added: 'It makes the prime minister directly accountable to parliament. The size of the Government's majority in the House at present makes that accountability more important and not less.' Time-wasting responses, which often confused the public, will be scrapped. Until now, after the Prime Minister set out his engagements for the day, each questioner had to ask again what the engagements were and the Prime Minister replied: 'I refer the honourable member to the reply I gave some moments ago.' Henceforth, the MP will be able to go straight into a supplementary question. Labour will also look at whether the questions should continue to be 'open' as at present, able to raise almost any issue, or 'closed', in which case MPs would have to give notice of the question, which would benefit the Prime Minister. Labour will argue that closed questions allow the Prime Minister to give detailed and considered replies but the Conservatives will argue that it makes it difficult to catch the Prime Minister off guard. Mr Blair, on Desert Island Discs, admitted he disliked intensely the two days on which PMQs were held. Mr Ashdown also found it difficult.",

Largely self-educated, he earned his first royalty at the age of 13, when he was paid $1 for a poem in his high school magazine. He didn't write seriously for another 30 years.</p> <p>Dropping out of school to ride the railways during the depression, he eventually reached Vancouver, where he took a series of manual jobs. During the second world war he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and his first collection of poems, The Enchanted Echo, was published in 1944, while he was still in uniform. The collection, he recalled, \"was so bad that I would blush to look at it now, if I was given to blushing, which I'm not.\"</p> <p>After that, Purdy mostly roamed the country, stopping wherever he could find work, until he settled in Ameliasburgh, a farming community first settled after the American revolution by displaced British loyalists. The area is celebrated in many of his most famous poems.</p> <p>By the early 1960s, he was able to earn enough money from poetry and freelance journalism to support his family. Brash, hard-drinking and belligerent, he once described himself as \"six foot three of indolence, two hundred pounds of weed,/ my better judgment voted me least likely to succeed.\"</p> <p>Purdy learned his craft through practice and experimentation. \"Your first way,\" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation last year, \"is to admit that you're not so good.\" His own transformation from \"writing doggerel\" came when he began composing completely free verse that did not depend on rhyme. In his 1974 collection, In Search Of Owen Roblin, Purdy explained: \"All the things I write about I've done myself/ if not with hands, but with my mind/ I am a screen thru which the world passes/ a thermometer registering pain and sorrow.\"</p> <p>Purdy came from an era of Canadian poets - such as Irving Layton, Alden Nowlan, Earle Birney and Milton Acorn - celebrated in the heady nationalist ambience of the 1960s and 1970s. Generous with his time and encouragement, he inspired younger poets, such as Dennis Lee, for whom Purdy's poetry tapped into \"an amazing range of emotions and facets of people's lives. He created an English Canadian voice that could range from everyday vernacular to soaring eloquence.\"</p> <p>\"The only thing that equals writing what you think is a good poem is to write another just as good,\" Purdy wrote in his autobiography. \"It is like coming home after a long absence, and knowing the trees and water and land are yours, your land; or waking up with the woman you have known all your life, and knowing she is your life; to feel the boundaries of yourself widen and expand in the sober drunkenness of your brain.\"</p> <p>When Collected Poems was published in 1986, it had to be set in small type so that the poems could be crammed into 400 pages. Yet the book was only a selection of his work, and not the last volume of a man still writing and arguing about Yeats on his deathbed. A final collection of poems, Beyond Remembering, will be published in September.</p> <p>Purdy won Canada's highest literary honour, the Governor-General's Award, for The Cariboo Hunters (1965) and later for the Collected Poems. He was a member of both the Order of Canada and of Ontario.</p> <p>He is is survived by his wife, Eurithe Mary Jane Parkhurst, whom he married in 1941, and their son.</p> <p><b>Alfred 'Al' Wellington Purdy, poet, born December 30 1918; died April 21 2000</b></p>",

In his 1974 collection, In Search Of Owen Roblin, Purdy explained: \"All the things I write about I've done myself/ if not with hands, but with my mind/ I am a screen thru which the world passes/ a thermometer registering pain and sorrow.\" Purdy came from an era of Canadian poets - such as Irving Layton, Alden Nowlan, Earle Birney and Milton Acorn - celebrated in the heady nationalist ambience of the 1960s and 1970s. Generous with his time and encouragement, he inspired younger poets, such as Dennis Lee, for whom Purdy's poetry tapped into \"an amazing range of emotions and facets of people's lives. He created an English Canadian voice that could range from everyday vernacular to soaring eloquence.\" \"The only thing that equals writing what you think is a good poem is to write another just as good,\" Purdy wrote in his autobiography. \"It is like coming home after a long absence, and knowing the trees and water and land are yours, your land; or waking up with the woman you have known all your life, and knowing she is your life; to feel the boundaries of yourself widen and expand in the sober drunkenness of your brain.\" When Collected Poems was published in 1986, it had to be set in small type so that the poems could be crammed into 400 pages. Yet the book was only a selection of his work, and not the last volume of a man still writing and arguing about Yeats on his deathbed. A final collection of poems, Beyond Remembering, will be published in September. Purdy won Canada's highest literary honour, the Governor-General's Award, for The Cariboo Hunters (1965) and later for the Collected Poems. He was a member of both the Order of Canada and of Ontario. He is is survived by his wife, Eurithe Mary Jane Parkhurst, whom he married in 1941, and their son. Alfred 'Al' Wellington Purdy, poet, born December 30 1918; died April 21 2000",

The attack, led by Tory opposition leader Lord Strathclyde , comes as Conservative peer Lord Rees Mogg will try today to pre-empt an inquiry by the committee of standards into public life by pressing for a rival inquiry run by peers themselves. Lord Neill has cancelled an appearance before the Commons public administration committee so he can explain to peers how he intends to have a wide-ranging impartial inquiry into the need for high standards of probity in the upper house. Lord Strathclyde said yesterday that \"it is becoming increasingly obvious that this whole process has been politicised\". He claimed that central to the inquiry was a proposal that opposition spokesman should divest themselves of their business interests, and that this idea had been put to the committee by Fraser Kemp, MP for Houghton and Washington East. Mr Kemp is one of Labour's election co-ordinators. Last night the Tory attack was criticised by Lord Neill's committee, who said the idea was neither central to the investigation, nor had it originated from the government. It is likely that the committee, which includes prominent Conservatives such as former cabinet minister John Macgregor as well as Labour stalwarts like Lord Shore, will examine the issue as part of a much wider examination of House of Lords procedures. The committee will also investigate whether the Lords register of interests should be tightened, making it compulsory to declare all interests, and whether to introduce an \"advocacy rule\" which bans peers promoting private bills and sponsoring motions where they have business interests. This was introduced in the Commons. Lord Neill is said to have been influenced by Tory peer Lord Wakeham's observation that the Lords was now more a target for lobbyists than the Commons.",

      "bodyText": "Why is there an inquiry? 31 people died when a commuter service run by Thames Trains passed a red signal on track near Ladbroke Grove station, west London, at 8am on October 5 1999, and collided with a Great Western Intercity travelling in the opposite direction. It came just two years after seven died in the Southall rail crash. Many said that a culture of profit in the privatised railways had pushed passenger safety into second place. What will the inquiry try to find out? Three accident reports since the crash have all concluded that the Thames train went through a signal on a red light. The inquiry's job is to establish why. The reasons are likely to be complex: some have suggested that signal 109 (which had been passed at red eight previous times) has a poor sight line and the inquiry will be investigating the signalling system as a whole. Of the companies involved, Railtrack blames the Thames train driver Michael Hodder and Thames trains blames Railtrack for the layout of the tracks outside Paddington and the siting of the signals. The last accident report said that \"any action or omission on the part of the driver was only one such factor in a failure involving many contributory factors\". Scottish judge Lord Cullen will chair the inquiry and submit his recommendations to the government. What can it do? The inquiry is not a trial. Its only concern is take evidence and establish what happened. Have previous public inquiries been successful? Lord Cullen chaired the inquiry into the Piper Alpha North Sea oil platform disaster in 1988 and is widely credited with changing the safety culture in that industry. However the success of any inquiry depends on what happens next. The Paddington survivors' spokesperson says the collision could have been avoided if the government had listened to the Clapham rail crash inquiry. It recommended the installation of automatic train protection (ATP) for the whole rail network after 35 people died in the rush hour collision. The government ruled it out as the \u00a3750m price tag was too high immediately prior to privatisation. Who will be giving evidence? Passengers, employees, corporate bodies and companies at the heart of the Paddington crash, including Railtrack, Thames Trains, First Great Western and the railway inspectorate. The two drivers involved died. Can anyone be prosecuted after the inquiry ? The crown prosecution service has already ruled that there is \"insufficient evidence\" to convict either a company or individual over the crash. The government's health and safety executive says however that it may be able to bring criminal charges against the rail companies under health and safety legislation. How does the law work in these cases? To secure a manslaughter conviction the law requires proof that a company director is guilty of gross negligence. In practice this means only small companies or individuals can be prosecuted for manslaughter, as it would be impossible to prove that the head of a large company employing thousands was personally responsible for a disaster.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>MONEY FOR NOTHING</strong></p> <p>The Fiver stayed up all night last night. And not to watch highlights of the Uruguayan Cup on Channel 5. No, we were putting the final touches to our multi-million squid bid for Premiership TV rights. The proposal had to be in by 5pm this afternoon, so as you can imagine there was a lot of scampering about organising camera angles, creating a broadcast company out of nothing, etc. But we got it in, along with 75 other \"bona fide\" bids, and that's what counts. Isn't it?</p> <p>Not quite, it seems, as the Premier League are believed to have hit on a new idea which, gasp, could net them even more money. Once the current round of closed bids has been assessed and sorted by type - ie: bids for live rights, bids for highlights and bids for footage of the boys in the team bath (that's us!) - rumours suggest that the Prem will then adopt tactics used by the government during the recent mobile-phone bandwidth auctions and have a second round of open bidding between competing companies.</p> <p>If the mobile precedent is anything to go by (the government raked in \u00a322bn when they had expected to take just \u00a32bn) then the Prem's estimate of a \u00a31bn bonanza might be a little under. It also raises the possibility of ITV adopting a cheeky Lovejoy approach - raising its bids higher and higher before dropping out to leave Rupert Murdoch with a huge bill for the televisual equivalent of a chipped teapot. Then again it might just mean that David Beckham gets more money to spend on tattoos. All will be revealed in June, we suppose.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SOFT, STRONG, AND STARTING ON JUNE 5</strong></p> <p>The Euro, the Fiver's cute Euro 2000 puppy, needs housetraining. It's brought to you in association with breathe, and will sit in your intray each morning next to a puddle of its own urine, keeping you up to date with everything that goes on in the lowlands this summer. To train it by issuing tactical beatings, send a mail to <a href=\"mailto:euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk\">euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk</a> with 'subscribe' in the subject line.</p> <p>By the way, if you get a incomprehensible mail back, blame our software. As long as the word 'succeeded' appears on it, you're fine.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FLOYD ON TEES</strong></p> <p>Bryan Robson doesn't back losers. Apart from Paul Gascoigne. And Paul Ince. Oh, and Juninho. Nevertheless, the Fiver isn't surprised to hear that top talent-spotter Robbo is ready to pull \u00a318m out of the long leather wallet in his long leather coat to buy Atletico Madrid success story Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Who missed a penalty which saw his team relegated last weekend.</p> <p>Actually, Hasselbaink (who left Leeds last summer for Spanish glory only to experience abject failure while his old club challenged for both Premiership and Euro-Vase) is really rather good. He scored a goal every two games with Leeds, and has taken the Spanish league - which, let's face it, is ever-so-slightly better than ours - by storm, scoring 24 goals in 36 games. You can hardly blame Atletico's demise on one scuffed hoof.</p> <p>So perhaps Bryan isn't as stupid as he looks (when parading a new signing at the Riverside). The only potential hitch is that Hasselbaink doesn't actually want a return to England (\"I would like to stay with a Spanish club\" he said today) and that Real Madrid and Valencia are both after his signature. Not that that bothers Robbo. \"If you don't ask, you don't get!\" he told the Journal as he flew out to Spain on a pig.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTES OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I can honestly guarantee you that if Rangers joined the English Premiership they would win it within three years\" - Astute football analyst Paul Gascoigne talking to the wholly-objective Rangers News.</p> <p>\"Lorenzo Amoruso is not a great player - he thinks he's a great player. He'd make even the slowest striker look half decent. Somebody compared him to Billy McNeill but I don't remember Billy being crap\" - The equally astute Tommy Docherty offers a different view on the Scottish giants.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER'S WORST PLAYER OF THE SEASON 1999-2000</strong></p> <p>Who will wear John Hartson's shiny crown?

Like the time Vinnie Jones gave Gazza a cheeky tug down below? Or when John 'Fash the Baptist' pushed terrified new players into a puddle to initiate them into the Wimbledon way? Now that was funny in any language - even Norwegian. </p> <p>But those days are now officially over - the Dons new Puma kit (worn for the first time in their 2-2 draw with Aston Villa) has been stripped of their famous nickname. Even more sinisterly, the new kit was originally designed with the Crazy Gang logo on it before Christmas - but was later suspiciously changed. Now you don't have to eat Whiskers to smell a rather large rat... but who could have killed off the Crazy Gang? </p> <p>The Fiver's chief suspect is new chairman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten. Not only does he look like the Hooded Claw from Penelope Pitstop, but he's also recently bought Sam Hammam's final 20 percent stake in the club. Furthermore he's Norwegian. But he's not the only man in our frame. Last week new manager Terry Burton claimed the players could have spirit and commitment without resorting to the \"dinosaur\" age - a reference, no doubt, to when Wiseodocus stalked the left wing looking for flesh, and Fashosauras Rex used its spiky elbows to make mincemeat of central defenders.</p> <p>But a spokesman for Puma thinks we're talking fossilised faeces. \"Simpler designs are the trend for football kits now. We talked to the fans as well as the club and they just want a cleaner product,\" he explained. In that case why not just sell Ben Thatcher?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Coventry's Gary McAllister and Phil Babb of Liverpool are tipped to swap clubs this summer. The 35-year-old Sky Blue captain has been tipped for a move to Anfield for some time and Babb, who was signed from Highfield Road for \u00a33.25m some six years ago, could be used as bait.</p> <p>Spurs will not be buying Calais striker Mickael Gerard, as reported in this morning's Mirror. George Graham said this afternoon in a club statement: \"There is absolutely no truth in this article that can only be described as mischievous garbage designed to incite and mislead our fans. The editor of this newspaper seriously needs to review his sports department which are either under pressure to write something and make up trash or are totally lacking in any understanding of football.\"</p> <p>Spurs look set to clinch a \u00a37m move for tall Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam.</p> <p>After they've bought Rivaldo for \u00a32.46.</p> <p>And Emile Heskey for \u00a311m.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Former Sheffield Wednesday director Joe Ashton fears \"a bloody battle\" with the club's shareholders this summer if Howard Culley does not quit as chairman. \"I think out of self respect our existing directors should stand down - just like John Major did after they lost the election,\" he said.</p> <p>Uefa will not implement any increased security measures in Copenhagen for the Euro-Vase final between Arsenal and Galatasaray.</p> <p>Chelsea have insisted they have received no approaches for Gianfranco Zola following reports in Turkey that the striker has agreed to join Fenerbahce next season. </p> <p>The Football League have announced that the away goals rule will be scrapped in favour of penalties for this season's play-off semi-finals.

Pleat said: \"We have no intention of selling David and I have no knowledge of any offers for him. Ginola is a great talent and a difficult one for any manager to have among his flock.

      "bodyText": "MONEY FOR NOTHING The Fiver stayed up all night last night. And not to watch highlights of the Uruguayan Cup on Channel 5. No, we were putting the final touches to our multi-million squid bid for Premiership TV rights. The proposal had to be in by 5pm this afternoon, so as you can imagine there was a lot of scampering about organising camera angles, creating a broadcast company out of nothing, etc. But we got it in, along with 75 other \"bona fide\" bids, and that's what counts. Isn't it? Not quite, it seems, as the Premier League are believed to have hit on a new idea which, gasp, could net them even more money. Once the current round of closed bids has been assessed and sorted by type - ie: bids for live rights, bids for highlights and bids for footage of the boys in the team bath (that's us!) - rumours suggest that the Prem will then adopt tactics used by the government during the recent mobile-phone bandwidth auctions and have a second round of open bidding between competing companies. If the mobile precedent is anything to go by (the government raked in \u00a322bn when they had expected to take just \u00a32bn) then the Prem's estimate of a \u00a31bn bonanza might be a little under. It also raises the possibility of ITV adopting a cheeky Lovejoy approach - raising its bids higher and higher before dropping out to leave Rupert Murdoch with a huge bill for the televisual equivalent of a chipped teapot. Then again it might just mean that David Beckham gets more money to spend on tattoos. All will be revealed in June, we suppose. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SOFT, STRONG, AND STARTING ON JUNE 5 The Euro, the Fiver's cute Euro 2000 puppy, needs housetraining. It's brought to you in association with breathe, and will sit in your intray each morning next to a puddle of its own urine, keeping you up to date with everything that goes on in the lowlands this summer. To train it by issuing tactical beatings, send a mail to euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk with 'subscribe' in the subject line. By the way, if you get a incomprehensible mail back, blame our software. As long as the word 'succeeded' appears on it, you're fine. * * * * * * * * * * * * * FLOYD ON TEES Bryan Robson doesn't back losers. Apart from Paul Gascoigne. And Paul Ince. Oh, and Juninho. Nevertheless, the Fiver isn't surprised to hear that top talent-spotter Robbo is ready to pull \u00a318m out of the long leather wallet in his long leather coat to buy Atletico Madrid success story Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Who missed a penalty which saw his team relegated last weekend. Actually, Hasselbaink (who left Leeds last summer for Spanish glory only to experience abject failure while his old club challenged for both Premiership and Euro-Vase) is really rather good. He scored a goal every two games with Leeds, and has taken the Spanish league - which, let's face it, is ever-so-slightly better than ours - by storm, scoring 24 goals in 36 games. You can hardly blame Atletico's demise on one scuffed hoof. So perhaps Bryan isn't as stupid as he looks (when parading a new signing at the Riverside). The only potential hitch is that Hasselbaink doesn't actually want a return to England (\"I would like to stay with a Spanish club\" he said today) and that Real Madrid and Valencia are both after his signature. Not that that bothers Robbo. \"If you don't ask, you don't get!\" he told the Journal as he flew out to Spain on a pig. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTES OF THE DAY \"I can honestly guarantee you that if Rangers joined the English Premiership they would win it within three years\" - Astute football analyst Paul Gascoigne talking to the wholly-objective Rangers News. \"Lorenzo Amoruso is not a great player - he thinks he's a great player. He'd make even the slowest striker look half decent. Somebody compared him to Billy McNeill but I don't remember Billy being crap\" - The equally astute Tommy Docherty offers a different view on the Scottish giants. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE FIVER'S WORST PLAYER OF THE SEASON 1999-2000 Who will wear John Hartson's shiny crown? Chris Sutton, Mickael Silvestre, Dagenham Davor Suker, Wim Jonk or Steffen Freund? Send your vote to the.boss@theguardian.com and wait for the result on Friday. If you're bored, set up a free email account with an amusing name and use that address to vote. * * * * * * * * * * * * * AH, HOW WE LAUGHED Can there be a soul in the land who hasn't raised a wry smile at the Crazy Gang's hilarious antics? Like the time Vinnie Jones gave Gazza a cheeky tug down below? Or when John 'Fash the Baptist' pushed terrified new players into a puddle to initiate them into the Wimbledon way? Now that was funny in any language - even Norwegian. But those days are now officially over - the Dons new Puma kit (worn for the first time in their 2-2 draw with Aston Villa) has been stripped of their famous nickname. Even more sinisterly, the new kit was originally designed with the Crazy Gang logo on it before Christmas - but was later suspiciously changed. Now you don't have to eat Whiskers to smell a rather large rat... but who could have killed off the Crazy Gang? The Fiver's chief suspect is new chairman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten. Not only does he look like the Hooded Claw from Penelope Pitstop, but he's also recently bought Sam Hammam's final 20 percent stake in the club. Furthermore he's Norwegian. But he's not the only man in our frame. Last week new manager Terry Burton claimed the players could have spirit and commitment without resorting to the \"dinosaur\" age - a reference, no doubt, to when Wiseodocus stalked the left wing looking for flesh, and Fashosauras Rex used its spiky elbows to make mincemeat of central defenders. But a spokesman for Puma thinks we're talking fossilised faeces. \"Simpler designs are the trend for football kits now. We talked to the fans as well as the club and they just want a cleaner product,\" he explained. In that case why not just sell Ben Thatcher? * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Coventry's Gary McAllister and Phil Babb of Liverpool are tipped to swap clubs this summer. The 35-year-old Sky Blue captain has been tipped for a move to Anfield for some time and Babb, who was signed from Highfield Road for \u00a33.25m some six years ago, could be used as bait. Spurs will not be buying Calais striker Mickael Gerard, as reported in this morning's Mirror. George Graham said this afternoon in a club statement: \"There is absolutely no truth in this article that can only be described as mischievous garbage designed to incite and mislead our fans. The editor of this newspaper seriously needs to review his sports department which are either under pressure to write something and make up trash or are totally lacking in any understanding of football.\" Spurs look set to clinch a \u00a37m move for tall Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam. After they've bought Rivaldo for \u00a32.46. And Emile Heskey for \u00a311m. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Former Sheffield Wednesday director Joe Ashton fears \"a bloody battle\" with the club's shareholders this summer if Howard Culley does not quit as chairman. \"I think out of self respect our existing directors should stand down - just like John Major did after they lost the election,\" he said. Uefa will not implement any increased security measures in Copenhagen for the Euro-Vase final between Arsenal and Galatasaray. Chelsea have insisted they have received no approaches for Gianfranco Zola following reports in Turkey that the striker has agreed to join Fenerbahce next season. The Football League have announced that the away goals rule will be scrapped in favour of penalties for this season's play-off semi-finals. If the aggregate scores are level after two legs, extra time will still be played but will be followed by a penalty shoot-out if necessary. Blackburn Rovers have signed a four-year sponsorship deal with Time Computers. Rangers have confirmed that captain Lorenzo Amoruso will miss the Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen on May 27. The Italian underwent surgery today on his ankle injury and will miss the final games of the season. David Pleat today insisted David Ginola would not be sold following his bust-up with the club after being dropped against Manchester United. Pleat said: \"We have no intention of selling David and I have no knowledge of any offers for him. Ginola is a great talent and a difficult one for any manager to have among his flock. But if we had two or three better players his brilliance wouldn't be so shining.\" Carlisle United have sacked general manager Martin Wilkinson four days after they preserved their Football League status. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match - Live (7.30pm) Des Lynam tries to quips furiously but nothing is left in the tank marked 'smooth'.

The court in Strasbourg held by a majority of four-three that Kudlip Sander's right to be tried by an impartial tribunal was violated in March 1995 when the judge at Birmingham crown court allowed the jury to continue hearing the case after a juror complained of racist comments by fellow jurors. But the court rejected Mr Sander's claim for compensation for three years in prison, lost earnings, property he had had to sell, his divorce and damage to his reputation caused by his conviction. He claimed \u00a3458,000 for lost earnings and the forced property sale alone, but the judges said they were not satisfied that the denial of a fair trial had caused his losses - implying that they believed a substitute jury might well have convicted him on the evidence. Mr Sander, British born but of Asian origin, stood trial with two other Asians on charges of conspiracy to defraud.

The Dagenham plant was regarded as having an old fashioned workforce, unreceptive to modern working practices. Allegations of racism at the plant had led to unofficial walk-outs. Jac Nasser, Ford's boss, had had to fly in from the US to help revolve the problem. None of this helped Dagenham's case for getting the contract to build a new model. In addition, the strong pound damaged the prospects of selling British-built Ford cars at competitive prices overseas. The government, already alarmed at the prospect of thousands of Rover jobs being lost as BMW offloads the loss-making British manufacturer, has struggled to persuade Ford to change its mind. But it had nothing to offer the global company. The severity of the problem at Dagenham was underlined in February when it switched to one-shift production, with the loss of 1,350 jobs. There was not sufficient overseas demand for its output. By November 2001 car assembly at Dagenham will have come to a halt, and a further 3,000 jobs will have gone. Although Dagenham will continue to produce diesel engines for the Ford group, the once proud plant will have become little more than a group component supplier.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A 12-year-old boy is stabbed to death on a crowded London street, yards away from his home. His 15-year-old brother is lying, injured, in hospital. Every parent reading this story sees a picture of their own son lying there in a pool of blood. We read the facts, checking for any details which might have rendered our own children equally vulnerable. We check our own actions and wonder whether there is anything that we are doing/not doing which might place our own children at similar risk. Only then, when we feel sure that our children are safe, do we stop and think about the parents for whom this occurrence is a real and devastating event, one which will change their lives utterly and forever. </p> <p>In reality the murder of Diego Pineiro-Villar in Covent Garden on Sunday night, is an extraordinarily rare event. Last year there were only five murders of children between the age of 5 and 14 in England and Wales. Even if you add the 14 who died of injuries which may have been purposely inflicted, our children are 40 times more likely to die on the roads. And yet there is something about this murder which cuts straight to that primitive fear of the sinister Pied Piper lurking at the school gates ready to take our children away. </p> <p>It is this reflex, this shiver of fear for our own children, which takes this murder off the crime pages and onto the parents page. Our instinct is to use this as some kind of object lesson, something for which policy should be developed. We look for scapegoats outside the realms of crime and punishment. Questions will be asked about where the parents were at that precise time; the police will be quizzed about why such a crime was allowed to happen; the school will be provided with money to build higher security gates - all of it in an attempt to quieten our own beating hearts, our fear that our children could be next. </p> <p>The details of the case will be poured over when it finally comes to court. On the basis of what we know now it seems clear that the Diego's school had already taken precautions to safeguard him from the attentions of an older man who had struck up some sort of relationship with him. The police had been informed of the man's presence and his interest in the child. Indeed that interest was published all over walls in the area where he had written; \"I'll always love you Diego. Please forgive me for everything.\" And yet in spite of all this surveillance, and the obvious concern of his mother, Diego died on a crowded street on a balmy Sunday evening. For once we cannot even blame passers by for failing to intervene. Diego's assailant was in his turn set upon by two waiters from an Indian restaurant. The police were on the scene within minutes but it was all too late. </p> <p>So what can we do with our need to take action? The most obvious channel for our outrage will be against the strangers lurking in our midst. According to some press reports, a man, who lives locally in a hostel, was seen regularly in the local park playing with children. He apparently focussed on Diego because the child, described by neighbours as \"always charming, helpful and polite\", was kind to him while the other children were not. What lesson do we learn from this? </p> <p>According to Michelle Elliott of Kidscape, an organisation which specialises in teaching children how to deal with danger we should tell children that most people are nice but you can't always tell by looking at people what they are like. \"We teach children to shout 'no!' and get away if threatened. Children have to be taught that they have to look after themselves as there is no alternative.\" </p> <p>Bleak advice, and in this particular case pretty useless. The boys were already shouting and running away. They would probably have done better to have run into a restaurant and asked for protection from the adults within - but then I expect they had been taught to be wary of strangers, particularly people who look different, as do those who actually came to their aid. </p> <p>But pretty bad advice in general. Do we really want a society in which children are brought up to regard all adults as potential risks? How would we go about teaching such advice? Children learn by example.

      "bodyText": "A 12-year-old boy is stabbed to death on a crowded London street, yards away from his home. His 15-year-old brother is lying, injured, in hospital. Every parent reading this story sees a picture of their own son lying there in a pool of blood. We read the facts, checking for any details which might have rendered our own children equally vulnerable. We check our own actions and wonder whether there is anything that we are doing/not doing which might place our own children at similar risk. Only then, when we feel sure that our children are safe, do we stop and think about the parents for whom this occurrence is a real and devastating event, one which will change their lives utterly and forever. In reality the murder of Diego Pineiro-Villar in Covent Garden on Sunday night, is an extraordinarily rare event. Last year there were only five murders of children between the age of 5 and 14 in England and Wales. Even if you add the 14 who died of injuries which may have been purposely inflicted, our children are 40 times more likely to die on the roads. And yet there is something about this murder which cuts straight to that primitive fear of the sinister Pied Piper lurking at the school gates ready to take our children away. It is this reflex, this shiver of fear for our own children, which takes this murder off the crime pages and onto the parents page. Our instinct is to use this as some kind of object lesson, something for which policy should be developed. We look for scapegoats outside the realms of crime and punishment. Questions will be asked about where the parents were at that precise time; the police will be quizzed about why such a crime was allowed to happen; the school will be provided with money to build higher security gates - all of it in an attempt to quieten our own beating hearts, our fear that our children could be next. The details of the case will be poured over when it finally comes to court. On the basis of what we know now it seems clear that the Diego's school had already taken precautions to safeguard him from the attentions of an older man who had struck up some sort of relationship with him. The police had been informed of the man's presence and his interest in the child. Indeed that interest was published all over walls in the area where he had written; \"I'll always love you Diego. Please forgive me for everything.\" And yet in spite of all this surveillance, and the obvious concern of his mother, Diego died on a crowded street on a balmy Sunday evening. For once we cannot even blame passers by for failing to intervene. Diego's assailant was in his turn set upon by two waiters from an Indian restaurant. The police were on the scene within minutes but it was all too late. So what can we do with our need to take action? The most obvious channel for our outrage will be against the strangers lurking in our midst. According to some press reports, a man, who lives locally in a hostel, was seen regularly in the local park playing with children. He apparently focussed on Diego because the child, described by neighbours as \"always charming, helpful and polite\", was kind to him while the other children were not. What lesson do we learn from this? According to Michelle Elliott of Kidscape, an organisation which specialises in teaching children how to deal with danger we should tell children that most people are nice but you can't always tell by looking at people what they are like. \"We teach children to shout 'no!' and get away if threatened. Children have to be taught that they have to look after themselves as there is no alternative.\" Bleak advice, and in this particular case pretty useless. The boys were already shouting and running away. They would probably have done better to have run into a restaurant and asked for protection from the adults within - but then I expect they had been taught to be wary of strangers, particularly people who look different, as do those who actually came to their aid. But pretty bad advice in general. Do we really want a society in which children are brought up to regard all adults as potential risks? How would we go about teaching such advice? Children learn by example. My own children have witnessed me talking to strangers (no matter what they look like) ever since they were born. Should I stop chatting to the Big Issue seller with the missing front teeth, sad eyes and dog on a string? Should I abandon my practice of getting to know new people when they move into the street - just in case I am sending out the wrong message? By bringing up our children to fear adults, and to hesitate before intervening to help another person, are we not merely adding to the alienation and isolation which makes our children vulnerable in the first place? For the NSPCC's director of child protection, Neil Hunt, the lesson to be learned is the importance of vigilance. \"Children thrive emotionally in the outdoors so we must ensure that all open spaces are child-friendly, supervised and safe.\" Sound advice for policy makers and something which every parent would be grateful for on a summer afternoon when their 12 year olds are playing, unsupervised, in a local park. There was a time when parks had keepers to care for the plants and for the children. In these days of contracting out, park maintenance goes to the lowest bidder who may only arrive to mow the grass once a week on a Monday. More adults employed in open spaces would almost certainly make them safer for children - but in this sad case such advice is meaningless. Diego was close to home, with an elder brother, in a crowded street. So where does this leave us? As parents we have to accept the unacceptable: that we can't control everything in our children's lives. Occasionally terrible things do happen.

Something as terrible as this makes us want to hug them close, bar the door and keep the world at bay. We can't do it. We have to allow them to step outside however much we fear for them. And we have to reassure them that, in most cases, the world is not a fearful place and a stranger is a friend you don't yet know - because that, thank God, is what the statistics really tell us.

She's been the sole breadwinner for the past eight years, ever since her husband, who once did something in business, was made redundant and became clinically depressed. He was so low he couldn't be trusted with the children, so she had to pay for a nanny, too. Well, eventually, it got so bad she couldn't take it anymore. She suggested a trial separation. Off he went, and before she had finished paying that month's bills, he had set up house down the road with one of her children's playmates' mothers. His depression disappeared, just like that! He told my friend that proved beyond doubt that she was the cause of it. And then, get ready for it, he told her that it was only fair if she did something to make up for it. He had an idea for a new business. And according to this poor excuse for a husband, it was up to my friend to find the start-up money. </p> <p>That's not the worst story I've ever heard. I know someone else, a mother of two, who's having to sell the marital home she got in her divorce settlement to put herself through a three-year training course. Her aim is to become financially independent, but it will be 10 years, she thinks, before she gets back to her pre-motherhood salary level. Or maybe it will take longer - because now it emerges that her ex is going to stop maintenance the moment she starts drawing any salary at all. Why should he bankrupt himself to support an independent woman? </p> <p>And here's another one - about a man, this time. He's been paying the mother of his only child double the maintenance required by the courts for 12 years without missing a payment. Round about the time this girl finished her exams and left home, this man had to take early medical retirement. That same month, he got a letter from a solicitor, to tell him that his wife did not just want child maintenance payments to continue ad infinitum. She wanted them to be doubled. Her reason? Simple: she needed the money. She also deserved it. If it hadn't been for his bad behaviour, they'd never have had to get divorced in the first place. </p> <p>Everyone who knows them would say that she's more or less right on this count. But how does that translate into pounds and pence? This woman has a job, for goodness sake. A job with a pension. That's what his friends say. What her friends say is that one salary is just not enough to keep a household going. This is also true. So what's fair? </p> <p>It used to be so simple. A good ex-husband was a man who supported his wife until such a time as she remarried. And a good ex-wife was someone who used that support to carry on being a good mother to their children. This is not to say that all or even most divorcing couples managed to hold to the ideal. Still we were fairly clear about how to assign blame when they didn't. But now, with so many women working, and some men becoming primary carers, the rules of this game have blurred. Our ideas of fair play have gone out the window. No one seems to know exactly who is responsible for what. One thing is clear, though: some people suffer greater losses post divorce than do others. </p> <p>It's long been known in policy circles that women are more likely to suffer a drop in income immediately following a divorce. This is usually because they have care of the children, and so cannot easily jump into full-time work. Most courts in this country take a \"rehabilitative\" approach in such cases. In other words, they encourage settlements that offer mothers with care of their children stability in the short-term, while encouraging them to become self-supporting in the long term. This is more or less in line with what most of us would think of as fair. But a new study of 66 recently divorced parents (written by Alison Perry and Gillian Douglas and commissioned by the Family Policy Studies Centre and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation) gives us a rather stark view of what happens next. </p> <p>Two years after divorce, the incomes of most of the 31 men in the study were the same as they had been when they were married. But nearly half of the women had not returned to their pre-separation income levels. Many were having to scramble and borrow money from their families, and they were twice as likely as the men to say they were having trouble making ends meet. While there was strong agreement about how important it was to give children stability by keeping them in their original home, half of the parents had not had the resources to see this fine idea through. For many, the question defining the divorce settlement had not been how to share the assets, but how to share the debts. </p> <p>The most disturbing finding in the study was the haphazard way in which most couples made these settlements. Only a few had been able to get good professional advice early on. Most did not retain solicitors until very late in the day: often this was to avoid \"antagonising\" the other party. There was a tendency, perhaps related, to go for informal arrangements. Thus, only a quarter of the mothers with care of children had maintenance in the form of a court order. While 29% received \"voluntary\" maintenance on a regular basis, and non-resident fathers often helped out with mortgage payments, clothes, holidays, school fees and so on, dependence of such goodwill arrangements meant that many women were financially insecure. The very worst news in this report is that most had not thought carefully about how they were going to support themselves in old age. </p> <p>This must be partly due to the fact that most of the mothers in the study were in their 30s and 40s - and so were more concerned about keeping shoes on their children's feet and roofs over their heads. But life goes on, and divorce is forever. A fair divorce settlement, according to John Cornwell, senior partner at Dawson Cornwell should be not just about income and assets and maintenance, but also about pensions and long-term security. Indeed, pension sharing is becoming a reality. But it is still the accepted norm for the man to walk away with his pension, and for the woman to go for arrangements that allow her to keep her head above water in the short-term. </p> <p>Often this is not because the wicked man is hoodwinking her, but because she herself is not fully aware of the issues. In other words, a lot of women are losing out in their divorce settlements because they do not get good advice. But they could, if they and their husbands went into mediation. </p> <p>According to Sheena Adam, chief executive of National Family Mediation, most people go into mediation with highly unrealistic ideas about how much the other party earns or how much they need to make ends meet. One of the jobs of the mediator is to go for full disclosure. The mediator then puts the facts on a flip chart, so that both parties can see the gap between appearance and reality. Often a woman will have not been involved with finances up until this point. If this is the case, the mediator will try to give her a clear idea about how the finances work. Once there has been a balancing of power in the negotiations, the aim then is to come to an agreement about how to share out the money and the responsibilities. Here, again, the key word is balance. There's no winning or losing. The aim is to come up with an arrangement that's fair. </p> <p>There are not nearly enough mediators out there to give advice to divorcing parents when they need it. If there were, we wouldn't be having to spend so much time fretting about fairness, and we wouldn't have so many stories about friends who are shafted by their money-grabbing exes. The questions of etiquette and proper conduct would remain. </p> <p>It will probably be decades before we have a clear idea about what a fair settlement looks like in a world where both men and women work and both men and women also care for their children. But most of the horror stories you hear of come about because people are na\u00efve about money, or don't anticipate problems, or make vague arrangements based on unarticulated assumptions, and leave too much too goodwill. It's because they fail to protect themselves in the beginning, that so many people find themselves being treated unfairly later on. With proper assistance at the right time, they can reach fair solutions that last.</p>",

She's been the sole breadwinner for the past eight years, ever since her husband, who once did something in business, was made redundant and became clinically depressed.

As far as Maff is concerned, this may simply be evidence of its commitment to the enterprise culture. But for everyone else it is deeply confusing. </p> <p>Maff had advertised its intention to place Chardon LL on the national seed list in the widely read Plant Variety and Seeds Gazette. It also held out a public invitation to object. Maff obviously didn't expect much of a response, because there appear to be no formal rules for the appeal process and no specific rights of objectors. In fact, it is here that everything becomes a little surreal, with different \"pay as you go\" objection options, a ministerial veto on who can be heard and no objectors' rights to cross-examine or challenge those making other claims. </p> <p>Unlike a planning inquiry, where citizens' rights to object are a free part of the democratic process, challenges to national seed listings cost you. For \u00a330 you can object in writing to Maff, while \u00a360 buys you a slot at a public hearing, and the \u00a390 all-singing all-dancing version allows you to do both. </p> <p>This is a novel \"cash for questions\" version of democracy in which the payment of cash doesn't guarantee the right to ask your question. To get to that stage, the minister must first decide whether you have a valid interest or not. The rules of the 1982 seed regulations are no clearer than that the minister must be convinced you have \"sufficient interest in the matter\", and/or are \"representative of a class of persons likely to be affected by the decision\". It is not enough to say that, since the disaster of BSE/CJD every one of us will be affected by agricultural decisions that charge across nature's frontiers in pursuit of short-term commercial gain. The minister will expect you to demonstrate a more specific claim. </p> <p>My own supplications have tried to move from soft-focus cynicism to hard-edged objection. The tests done on Chardon LL have been partial, superficial and (because its EU approval was granted under 1998 rules) do not meet the test requirements that apply today. There has been no testing of its consequences or effects on the animal (and human) feed chain. There has been no study of its impact on soil fertility and the soil nutrient cycle. And Maff has failed to address evidence of horizontal gene transfers from GM crops to non-GM varieties and the wider environment. Have I strutted my stuff enough? I hope so minister, because I would really like to make it to stage two of the democratic labyrinth. For it is here that we move from the arbitrary to the obscure. </p> <p>A public hearing is not like a public inquiry. You get to express your views to \"a government appointed person\", whoever that may be - the cleaner, a temp from the nearest call-centre, or an off-duty 0898 operator? How will it be for me? Should I talk dirty about soil fertility, cross-pollination and the like? Will they encourage me, breathing \"yes, yes\" across the table until I've had my \u00a390 worth, only to be summarily disconnected from the ministerial chat-line to make way for the next hopeful punter? I don't know what will make the earth move from under the absurdity of Maff's proposal. </p> <p>When he announced the farm scale trials of GM crops in October 1998, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said: \"It is extremely important that we do not travel further down the road to commercialisation of GM crops before we have this information.\" The farm scale trials will not be completed until 2003 and Chardon LL is one of the crops being trialled.

      "bodyText": "Rising up in a plateau between Bakewell and Matlock, the former Bronze Age burial ground of Stanton Moor offers one of the most haunting landscapes in the Peak District national park. The combination of birch woodlands, open heather and spectacular views have always been popular with walkers, while the Nine Ladies stone circle and some 70-odd neolithic burial chambers have made Stanton a scheduled ancient monument. Unfortunately for conservationists, this little jewel in the Peak is also rich in minerals, and the surrounding area is scored with active and dormant quarries. In recent months the future of Stanton Moor has been called into question, following a controversial proposal to re-open a dormant quarry on the edge of the moor. Since last winter, local residents protesting against the proposal have been joined by an encampment of eco-protesters, and a minor planning dispute has become a major headache for the park authority.

The company's environmental assessment failed to calm the fears of local residents on a range of issues, including the prospect of heavy lorries on inappropriate roads, noise and dust pollution, tipping and waste removal, environmental damage and the possible blockage of the village's natural water supply.

Middle-aged, married with kids, safely suburban, I'd never been in trouble in my life. Now, for the first time, I was to appear in court. The prospect frightened me - and had done so ever since the envelope arrived, summoning me to appear as prosecution witness. </p> <p>Six months ago, I had been bitten by a dog, while jogging on the school playing fields where I teach. The police had been helpful and keen to take up the case. No lasting damage had been done, but it was still a scary experience, with the same sense of \"personal space violation\" as a minor assault. Any child would have been scarred for life; I considered it my \"duty\" to press charges. </p> <p>But, as the date loomed larger, I felt increasingly as if it was me on trial: my word against that of the dog-owner. The information I'd received in advance actually fostered this sense of dread. Offers of a witness support service may be well-intended, but the effect is undoubtedly to cause concern. Why should anyone need \"support?\" Is it really so frightening? </p> <p>The Witness in Court leaflet, too, while seeking to smooth away concerns, accomplishes the reverse. When you read the advice on going to court - the magistrates, oath, witness-room: all sketched out in remorseless detail - you start to feel like a criminal yourself. The more the procedure is explained, the more you regret the case coming to court in the first place. </p> <p>Now here I was: plucked from the reassuring routines of school, plonked in a strange world of serious faces. A clear \"us\" and \"them\" was evident in this waiting-area: the lawyers, with sleek looks, sharp suits and mobiles; the \"villains\", with studied unconcern and full Nike finest. Few were smiling; few, presumably, had much reason to. There were magazines on the tables (firmly bolted to the floor), but most lay untouched. It was like the dentist's - only worse. </p> <p>And the waiting took longer. An hour passed and I despaired of being called. I only had half a day off school; so, if things didn't start moving, a lot of kids were going to be left teacher-less later on. </p> <p>Most cases seemed to be driving offences - no insurance, no MoT - or \"drunk and disorderly\". I briefly envied one carefree bloke who breezed in and said: \"Just let me plead guilty and get on with it, so I can get back to work.\" But there was no hurrying justice. </p> <p>Nearly two hours, and the prosecutor at last appeared for a briefing. He said it was \"rare\" for a dog-bite to come to court; this itself alarmed me (what was so special about my case?). But he brought good news. At least I was being spared the biggest worry of all: bumping into the dog-owner again. (I'd been watching the stairwell anxiously, waiting for her to appear.) She'd pleaded guilty by letter, so wouldn't be appearing in person. </p> <p>In the nick of time, just before I needed to head back to school, I was called to give evidence. By now I'd been fretting for two-and-a-half hours; but nothing prepared me for how nervous I felt mounting that witness box. As an experienced teacher, I was used to standing up in front of strange faces. But I was shaking when I took the oath; my confident \"teacher voice\" quavered. If ever an experience underlined the full immensity and power of the legal system - what our rule of law actually means - this was it. </p> <p>Yet this was a trivial offence, tried in an empty courtroom. For something serious, in a tense, crowded court, with prison hanging in the balance, the experience must be terrifying. </p> <p>For the next five minutes, I weighed each word carefully: with the clerk taking notes, it was impossible not to. It was also impossible not to try \"reading\" the expressions of the three magistrates on the bench above me. </p> <p>And then I was free to go. After waiting so long, I wanted to listen to the rest of the case in the gallery; but my GCSE class could wait no longer. Later, I discovered that, although the owner had pleaded guilty, the case had been adjourned for another month so she could appear in person. Yet more uncertainty. </p> <p>It's no wonder that, despite Jack Straw's encouragement, so many people are reluctant to \"get involved\". The lesson I learned was that courts are places to stay well clear of.</p>",

In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on the need to recognise that older patients frequently need longer to recover from trauma or surgery.

At present there is very little short-term use of nursing home care in the sense that is now being envisaged. The vast majority of such homes have neither the facilities, the staff or the skills to offer the type of rehabilitation which would be required. As David Hinchliffe (chair of the health select committee) has also cautioned, many such homes encourage dependence rather than independence. Indeed, the system has failed to provide any financial incentives for nursing homes to do anything other than maintain high occupancy levels. </p> <p>Developing the role of the nursing home to provide sub-acute level care is not a new idea, and various models exist. However, these are characterised by a range of features including investment in appropriate staff, and the provision of facilities which enable the home to operate in a genuinely rehabilitative mode (such as self-contained flatlets which people can move into in preparation for more independence and a return home). These features cannot simply be bolted on to homes which happen to have spare beds. Moreover, it is a matter of some uncertainty whether, even if it were possible to develop this capacity, the approach could co-exist within homes where the major business remains that of long-term (that is, permanent) care. </p> <p> In anticipation of the white paper on long-term care, it seems that speculation about likely developments continues unabated. This latest proposal for the use of nursing homes as an overflow valve for the acute sector comes hard on the heels of a story that the government is moving towards a position in which nursing care would be free - in part, but certainly not in whole, addressing the recommendations of the royal commission on long-term care. </p> <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that leaks and rumours are being used to test response to ideas without going through the usual democratic processes of formal consultation on policy proposals. </p> <p>It is undeniable that many elderly people currently occupying hospital beds need not be there.

The short-term answer offered by this new overflow initiative not only ignores the valuable work which is already under way, but risks introducing a slick political solution which overlooks the very real practical impediments to changing the ethos and motivation of nursing home providers. More significantly, it is a solution which appears essentially to be born out of a perspective which views older people as a burden to the NHS, and a commodity to be shunted elsewhere. </p> <p>Without considerable development, and real investment, this proposal is not an answer to how best to care for older people needing sub-acute care, but to the quite separate issue of how to deliver on the continuing spectre of the waiting list pledge. </p> <p>\u0095 Melanie Henwood is an independent health and social care analyst.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Finance is no longer an issue in the NHS. The recent massive injection of cash - an additional \u00a32bn on top of the existing allocation for 2000/2001 and real growth of 5.6% for each of the three following years - has brought an end to the NHS financial crisis. Or at least that is what ministers would have us believe. </p> <p>The government has clearly scored huge political points with what it describes as the biggest ever, sustained investment in the health service. Ministers talk of the health service now having a sound financial footing. But does it? </p> <p>The words \"financial crisis\" may be bandied around too freely, but last year the NHS came close. Unfunded pay increases, which reached 10% for some nurses, the full year effect of the previous year's staggered pay award, the soaring costs of generic drugs, the flu \"epidemic\" - all of these conspired to make a mockery of the service's original target to reach financial balance in 1999/2000. Instead, despite additional funding of \u00a3135m announced in December, the service in England is expected to show a deficit of some \u00a3200m for the year. </p> <p>Clearly the new resources announced in the Budget for 2000/2001, of which the English health service's share is \u00a31.4bn, dwarf this deficit. Hence ministers' apparent confidence that they have dealt with the whole money issue, leaving them to concentrate on their modernisation agenda and performance issues. </p> <p>Unfortunately, neat as this appears, it is far from the whole story. So far, ministers have allocated just \u00a3600m to English health authorities with no strings attached. (A further \u00a360m has been used to create a special fund to reward good performers.) Again, this may seem more than ample compared to last year's \u00a3200m deficit. But a survey by the Healthcare Financial Management Association looking at early, pre-Budget versions of the service and financial frameworks (the post-internal market name for contracts) indicated a deficit in 2000/2001 of around \u00a3500m, if targets on waiting lists and coping with winter pressures were to be met. </p> <p>The extra \u00a3600m should wipe this out at a stroke, enabling the service to manage within its means this year, and perhaps enable some small new developments from the fledgling primary care groups and trusts. But it does not make much of a dent in the service's historical deficit. It is a point hammered home by Barry Elliott, chairman of the Healthcare Financial Management Association. \"Even if the whole of the \u00a3600m were allocated to address financial pressures, at best it is going to avoid the NHS going into further deficit in 2000/01 or having to make even more unpalatable reductions to services,\" he says. \"It is, however, unlikely to be sufficient to recover accumulated deficits or improve the overall liquidity position.\" </p> <p>But just how much debt has the service accumulated? Press reports vary wildly on this issue, with some talking of a \u00a3200m deficit while others put the NHS debt teetering on \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The confusion is understandable. At various times, ministers and health managers talk of in-year, accumulated and underlying deficits. But even when you know which deficit you are talking about, there are problems. </p> <p>According to the National Audit Office's report on the NHS's most recently published accounts for 1998/99, by the end of March last year the accumulated deficit stood at some \u00a3500m, made up of a \u00a3700m deficit for health authorities and a \u00a3200m surplus for trusts. And this is before taking account of the expected \u00a3200m in-year deficit in 1999/2000. </p> <p>Even this figure demands further investigation. According to the NAO, health authorities' accumulated deficit in March last year included \u00a3385m for long-term creditors and \"provisions\" for pension and clinical negligence costs. Commercial style accounting practice in the NHS requires health bodies to record an estimate, for instance, for the future settlement of a clinical negligence claim in the year in which the incident occurs, even though the payment may not be made for several years. The increase in provisions for clinical negligence is a major concern, implying major expenditure downstream. But eliminating this part of the deficit now would actually be poor use of public funds, as it would mean stockpiling cash to cover the future settlement rather than spending the funds up front on patient care. </p> <p>Ministers and health department civil servants can rightly claim that this amounts to an almost technical deficit. But there are other figures within the accounts that appear more alarming. For instance, adding together the net current liabilities for both health authorities and trusts at the end of 1998/99 - that is, debts falling due within one year - gives a massive \u00a3750m. To some, this is the crucial figure and one health service manager told the Guardian this was now reaching a \"dangerous level\". And there are even more bewildering figures lurking in the background. The NHS liquidity position, or level of external debt, is causing concern, standing at some \u00a3640m at the end of 1998/99. Managers say this figure has risen dramatically over the last 12 months. </p> <p>One way of managing these short-term debts is to delay payment to creditors. And the NHS performance on timely payments is woeful. The public sector payment performance target dictates that health bodies should aim to pay 95% of non-NHS invoices within 30 days. The NAO's recent report found that in 1998/99 just 13% of health authorities and 17% of trusts achieved this target. </p> <p>It is not immediately clear what level of deficit is \"real\" and a cause for concern. But the money so far allocated from the new resources is not enough to give the service the firm financial footing the government wants. The funds are there in the amount still unallocated, but eliminating accumulated deficits is not as sexy as promising to recruit more medical staff or ramp up activity levels. </p> <p>The government recently decided to use all the \u00a322.5bn (windfall from the mobile phone licence auction) to pay off government debt. But will it be so prudent in the health service and clear its debts before starting its modernisation spending spree? According to Elliott, the success of the modernisation programme depends upon it. He says: \"Unless we do address this honestly and openly and use the generous funding that has been made available to restore financial stability then the rest of the agenda is doomed.\"</p>",

Unfortunately, neat as this appears, it is far from the whole story. So far, ministers have allocated just \u00a3600m to English health authorities with no strings attached. (A further \u00a360m has been used to create a special fund to reward good performers.) Again, this may seem more than ample compared to last year's \u00a3200m deficit. But a survey by the Healthcare Financial Management Association looking at early, pre-Budget versions of the service and financial frameworks (the post-internal market name for contracts) indicated a deficit in 2000/2001 of around \u00a3500m, if targets on waiting lists and coping with winter pressures were to be met. The extra \u00a3600m should wipe this out at a stroke, enabling the service to manage within its means this year, and perhaps enable some small new developments from the fledgling primary care groups and trusts. But it does not make much of a dent in the service's historical deficit. It is a point hammered home by Barry Elliott, chairman of the Healthcare Financial Management Association. \"Even if the whole of the \u00a3600m were allocated to address financial pressures, at best it is going to avoid the NHS going into further deficit in 2000/01 or having to make even more unpalatable reductions to services,\" he says. \"It is, however, unlikely to be sufficient to recover accumulated deficits or improve the overall liquidity position.\" But just how much debt has the service accumulated? Press reports vary wildly on this issue, with some talking of a \u00a3200m deficit while others put the NHS debt teetering on \u00a31bn. The confusion is understandable. At various times, ministers and health managers talk of in-year, accumulated and underlying deficits. But even when you know which deficit you are talking about, there are problems. According to the National Audit Office's report on the NHS's most recently published accounts for 1998/99, by the end of March last year the accumulated deficit stood at some \u00a3500m, made up of a \u00a3700m deficit for health authorities and a \u00a3200m surplus for trusts. And this is before taking account of the expected \u00a3200m in-year deficit in 1999/2000. Even this figure demands further investigation. According to the NAO, health authorities' accumulated deficit in March last year included \u00a3385m for long-term creditors and \"provisions\" for pension and clinical negligence costs. Commercial style accounting practice in the NHS requires health bodies to record an estimate, for instance, for the future settlement of a clinical negligence claim in the year in which the incident occurs, even though the payment may not be made for several years. The increase in provisions for clinical negligence is a major concern, implying major expenditure downstream. But eliminating this part of the deficit now would actually be poor use of public funds, as it would mean stockpiling cash to cover the future settlement rather than spending the funds up front on patient care. Ministers and health department civil servants can rightly claim that this amounts to an almost technical deficit. But there are other figures within the accounts that appear more alarming. For instance, adding together the net current liabilities for both health authorities and trusts at the end of 1998/99 - that is, debts falling due within one year - gives a massive \u00a3750m. To some, this is the crucial figure and one health service manager told the Guardian this was now reaching a \"dangerous level\". And there are even more bewildering figures lurking in the background. The NHS liquidity position, or level of external debt, is causing concern, standing at some \u00a3640m at the end of 1998/99. Managers say this figure has risen dramatically over the last 12 months. One way of managing these short-term debts is to delay payment to creditors. And the NHS performance on timely payments is woeful. The public sector payment performance target dictates that health bodies should aim to pay 95% of non-NHS invoices within 30 days. The NAO's recent report found that in 1998/99 just 13% of health authorities and 17% of trusts achieved this target. It is not immediately clear what level of deficit is \"real\" and a cause for concern. But the money so far allocated from the new resources is not enough to give the service the firm financial footing the government wants. The funds are there in the amount still unallocated, but eliminating accumulated deficits is not as sexy as promising to recruit more medical staff or ramp up activity levels. The government recently decided to use all the \u00a322.5bn (windfall from the mobile phone licence auction) to pay off government debt. But will it be so prudent in the health service and clear its debts before starting its modernisation spending spree? According to Elliott, the success of the modernisation programme depends upon it. He says: \"Unless we do address this honestly and openly and use the generous funding that has been made available to restore financial stability then the rest of the agenda is doomed.\"",

He gropes for the words to express the frustration he feels. </p> <p>At 78, Ralph could have easily ended up in residential care before his time, or as a hospital \"bed-blocker\" because there's no one to care for him back home. But thanks to an innovative social services scheme in his area, there is a good chance he will be able to live at home independently and on his own terms. The East Sussex Living at Home programme is using 38 of its residential home placements to help older people regain skills and confidence - typically after being hospitalised for a fall or a stroke - before returning home. </p> <p>At St Anthony's Court in Eastbourne, Ralph and five other temporary residents have been put through their paces by a team of occupational therapists, physiotherapists and care workers. The aim, after six to eight weeks, is to be able to wash, dress, cook and generally cope at home. </p> <p>Angela Howes came in after a hip replacement operation and was lurching badly when she walked. Now she's looking forward to doing a spot of gardening in her newly adapted flat. Ron Walters, who is 75, had a bad stroke and couldn't walk straight when he arrived. After six weeks of exercise programmes and memory games, he's making tea, washing up and - with help - going out to the shops. </p> <p>Just one year into the scheme, it has already had a 70% success rate at helping people live at home. Staff say it's much more effective than old-style rehabilitation programmes, that the emphasis on confidence-building and the camaraderie between \"guests\" really helps. </p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has acknowledged the importance of this kind of intermediate care, or \"reablement,\" in preventing people being rehospitalised, or needing institutional care. The trouble is, there isn't much of it about and funding for such schemes is precarious. </p> <p>The East Sussex programme got some help from NHS \"winter pressures\" money. But the social services budget is very tight, particularly when it comes to financing follow-up services that many people still need after completing an intensive home care programme. This often involves buying in provision from the independent sector, says assistant social services director Heather Hills. Finding the money for that is difficult. Only people on the highest eligibility band get referred to Living at Home, and they are charged for it on a means-tested basis. </p> <p>Nationally, the number of people receiving home care services has dropped by 7% in one year. According to one survey by welfare charities, nine out of 10 elderly or disabled people have suffered cuts in home care, ranging from housework and meals-on-wheels to help with using the lavatory. </p> <p>Ironically, the \u00a32bn cash injection recently announced for the NHS could make matters even worse. None of the extra money is earmarked for spending on social care. The focus on cutting waiting lists and speeding up hospital discharges inevitably will mean more people needing at least short-term community care when they come out, with social services being expected to pick up the tab. </p> <p>Social services chiefs are looking, though none too optimistically, to July's comprehensive spending review. In North Yorkshire, where some people pay over \u00a3100 a week for home care, the head of community care services admits that the service they are able to provide is \"pretty minimal\": in some cases, not even access to a regular bath. Their central government funding does not allow for any additional growth in demand on the previous year. </p> <p>In Essex, social services director Mike Leadbetter says local hospitals are worried about the impact of bed-blocking on their ability to meet patient through-put targets. But social services cannot come to the rescue with suitable care packages, because underfunding has led to severe staff shortages. </p> <p> Radar, the disability charity, says that many social services departments are bumping up charges for services by at least 9%. At one Brighton day centre where this has recently happened, the manager fears that elderly people will be deterred from using a service that helps keep them physically and mentally well. </p> <p>At St Anthony's, manager Denise Leary say it's often the little things - home adaptations, aids to help pour a kettle or get dressed, a bit of social contact - that make the difference to successfully living at home. </p> <p>When living-at-home residents leave, they are followed up for several weeks by a home care team. But it's what happens further down the line, and to all those who don't qualify for high-level support, that concerns the workers. \"What most older people want is to get back home, not end up in long-term care, when they've been in hospital,\" says Leary. \"But you can't give them that on thin air.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>People over 50 are forced to volunteer; charities account for 15% of GDP; and all charity tax breaks have been abolished. Could this be the charity world in 2020? Today, finance directors of charities will gather at a conference, themed Figuring Out The Future, to discuss potential developments in the 21st century. </p> <p> The keynote speaker is Michael Mainelli, from the management consultants, Z/Yen. He has a wealth of experience in industry and the voluntary sector and specialises in assessing financial risk. Mainelli will present three scenarios of the charity sector in 20 years' time. He says you can't predict the future but you can plan for it and scenarios are a way of checking whether an organisation would be prepared for any eventuality. </p> <p> He calls the first scenario \"control freaks\", and describes the charity world as the new glamour sector. \"Since the emergence in the early 2000s of the MCA (Master of Charities Administration), the sector has been the career of choice for more and more high-fliers. Instead of going to the power-starved House of Lords, ex-ministers will flock to the sector as a second career.\" </p> <p> In this scenario, he continues, charities will also have an increased global influence. \"On the international scene, the voluntary sector is the new cavalry, riding to the rescue. Since AAA (Aid and Administration for Africa) took over the management of three African countries five years ago, with at least limited success in two of the three countries, NGOs have been the mechanism of choice for dealing with international systemic failures.\" Up to 20% of OECD GDP will be invested in the voluntary sector, according to the scenario, but Mainelli foresees that critics will claim that the larger charities are too cost-obsessed to take risks. </p> <p> In fact, this is what one of the other speakers at the conference, Stephen Lee, claims is happening today. A research fellow at South Bank University, London, specialising in fundraising, Lee believes that finance directors are too focused on short-term gain and are worried about the public's perception of charities spending too much on fundraising. </p> <p> But Lee says research shows that donors understand the need to invest in fundraising to accumulate. \"Fundraising needs longer term investment,\" he says. \"Finance directors should take the risk and spend some of their reserves. In terms of return on investment, fundraising far out-performs other forms of income generation.\"</p> <p> Other speakers will cover the impact of e-commerce on the sector, how finance directors should make the most of the government's recent changes to charity taxation, and even how they should dress for the future. </p> <p> Suzi Carberry, of consultants, Public i, will argue that finance directors are grey and boring and that they should take more responsibility for the image of their charity. With the move towards dressing down or \"smart casual\", Carberry will advise finance directors on how to maintain an image of authority and credibility. \"The British have a propensity to look a mess when they dress casually,\" she says. \"Men only have to undo a button and they look like an unmade bed!\" </p> <p> Organisers of the conference, the Charity Finance Directors' Group, were surprised by how much interest has been shown in this seminar. But it does tie in with what the director of CFDG, Shirley Scott, sees as the main aim of the conference: \"To make sure finance directors are contributing towards maintaining the public's confidence in charities.\" </p> <p> To this end, experts from within the sector and from the corporate world will give advice on socially responsible investment, good governance and controlling risk. Finance directors will also learn about the impact of IT and legal changes on their work. Scott says: \"Financial management is moving forward rapidly due to legal and technological changes and we hope this conference will help finance directors keep apace and prepare for the future.\" </p> <p> The future, according to another of Mainelli's scenarios, could be that the public automatically gives 5% of its income to charities and a C8 summit of the richest global charities meets to announce that its joint income outstrips the economy of Italy. With all these possibilities, finance directors won't just need a new shirt; they might need a space suit to be prepared for the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "People over 50 are forced to volunteer; charities account for 15% of GDP; and all charity tax breaks have been abolished. Could this be the charity world in 2020? Today, finance directors of charities will gather at a conference, themed Figuring Out The Future, to discuss potential developments in the 21st century. The keynote speaker is Michael Mainelli, from the management consultants, Z/Yen. He has a wealth of experience in industry and the voluntary sector and specialises in assessing financial risk. Mainelli will present three scenarios of the charity sector in 20 years' time. He says you can't predict the future but you can plan for it and scenarios are a way of checking whether an organisation would be prepared for any eventuality. He calls the first scenario \"control freaks\", and describes the charity world as the new glamour sector. \"Since the emergence in the early 2000s of the MCA (Master of Charities Administration), the sector has been the career of choice for more and more high-fliers. Instead of going to the power-starved House of Lords, ex-ministers will flock to the sector as a second career.\" In this scenario, he continues, charities will also have an increased global influence. \"On the international scene, the voluntary sector is the new cavalry, riding to the rescue. Since AAA (Aid and Administration for Africa) took over the management of three African countries five years ago, with at least limited success in two of the three countries, NGOs have been the mechanism of choice for dealing with international systemic failures.\" Up to 20% of OECD GDP will be invested in the voluntary sector, according to the scenario, but Mainelli foresees that critics will claim that the larger charities are too cost-obsessed to take risks. In fact, this is what one of the other speakers at the conference, Stephen Lee, claims is happening today. A research fellow at South Bank University, London, specialising in fundraising, Lee believes that finance directors are too focused on short-term gain and are worried about the public's perception of charities spending too much on fundraising. But Lee says research shows that donors understand the need to invest in fundraising to accumulate. \"Fundraising needs longer term investment,\" he says. \"Finance directors should take the risk and spend some of their reserves. In terms of return on investment, fundraising far out-performs other forms of income generation.\" Other speakers will cover the impact of e-commerce on the sector, how finance directors should make the most of the government's recent changes to charity taxation, and even how they should dress for the future. Suzi Carberry, of consultants, Public i, will argue that finance directors are grey and boring and that they should take more responsibility for the image of their charity. With the move towards dressing down or \"smart casual\", Carberry will advise finance directors on how to maintain an image of authority and credibility. \"The British have a propensity to look a mess when they dress casually,\" she says. \"Men only have to undo a button and they look like an unmade bed!\" Organisers of the conference, the Charity Finance Directors' Group, were surprised by how much interest has been shown in this seminar. But it does tie in with what the director of CFDG, Shirley Scott, sees as the main aim of the conference: \"To make sure finance directors are contributing towards maintaining the public's confidence in charities.\" To this end, experts from within the sector and from the corporate world will give advice on socially responsible investment, good governance and controlling risk. Finance directors will also learn about the impact of IT and legal changes on their work. Scott says: \"Financial management is moving forward rapidly due to legal and technological changes and we hope this conference will help finance directors keep apace and prepare for the future.\" The future, according to another of Mainelli's scenarios, could be that the public automatically gives 5% of its income to charities and a C8 summit of the richest global charities meets to announce that its joint income outstrips the economy of Italy. With all these possibilities, finance directors won't just need a new shirt; they might need a space suit to be prepared for the future.",

You wonder why film-makers bother - after all, everyone watches the Cannes competition in the hope of seeing cinema's future revealed in a flash of innovation, and surely it won't be found in a pile of whalebone and old linen. </p> <p>Nevertheless, periwigs and perukes are big this year, with not one but two dramas set in the age of Louis XIV - Roland Joff\u00e9's <strong>Vatel</strong> (pictured), which opens the festival tonight, and Patricia Mazuy's Saint-Cyr, with Isabelle Huppert as Madame de Maintenon. It's no surprise that the long-established firm of quality costumiers to the gentry, Merchant and Ivory, have made another Henry James adaptation, <strong>The Golden Bowl</strong>. But now even the more left-field French directors are getting in on the act, with Arnaud Desplechin's film <strong>Esther Kahn</strong>, set in the East End of Victorian London, and Olivier Assayas (best known for the quintessential film-about-film Irma Vep) tackling the porcelain trade of old Limoges. </p> <p>Among the Asian films are Nagisa Oshima's <strong>Gohatto</strong>, about gay samurai in the 1860s, and Ang Lee's <strong>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</strong>, set in the Ching dynasty. </p> <p>Critics in Cannes tend to have something of a prejudice against costume cinema, especially those in the epic mould. A few years ago, following a run of spongy, over-egged Euro-puddings, I decided to skip the morning's big French heritage offering. Later that day, I asked a colleague if I'd missed anything. \"Missed anything?\" she practically swooned. \"You only missed Vincent Perez in tights.\" </p> <p>When I finally saw it, I realised that <strong>La Reine Margot</strong>, Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's grim, crackling tableau of the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, had a lot more going for it than Perez's well-turned calves. But don't discount the lure of the tights. The highest-minded film academics will all tell you that this is precisely the erotic appeal of the genre - the chance to see your favourite stars wearing fetching (and, in some cases, fetishising) attire from bygone days. </p> <p>It's only when there's a deeper correlation between the clothes and the way people behave when wearing them that a costume drama really takes off - when clothes become metaphor for manners and vice versa. The best Cannes costume extraganza in recent memory was Patrice Leconte's <strong>Ridicule</strong>. The entire story, about court politics in Versailles, revolved around the question of how you wore a wig, what you said when you wore it, and what sins of vanity and folly those wigs covered: it's a film about costume and custom. </p> <p>What can be irksome about historical drama is the neurotic fastidiousness of the whole undertaking. If a costume picture works, no single item of clothing should jump out in its magnificence. At the same time, no corner of the screen must be left undressed: you can't have a Regency beau if he isn't walking down a Regency street patrolled by Regency horses and illuminated by a Regency sunset. That's the strange logic of historical reconstruction - not just the actors, but the sets, architecture, even lighting must, in a sense, be in costume. </p> <p>That factor explains the brilliance of Ridley Scott's <strong>Gladiator</strong>, released in Britain this week, which may prove to be the most fiendishly thorough costume epic ever made: there isn't a single element on screen at any point that hasn't in some sense been dressed for the occasion. And the strange result is that, after a while, you don't really see Gladiator as a costume film. Where Hollywood Roman epics traditionally flashed their togas with pride, Scott's film comes across not as a costume drama, which suggests something stagey and static, but as an action picture that moves. Because every centimetre of the screen is decked out to full period effect, Gladiator doesn't so much evoke the past as create its own vivid present. </p> <p>After a while, you barely notice what people are wearing. At least, you don't look at them as if they're wearing old clothes. The notable exceptions are Joaquin Phoenix's eerie talcum-white armour, and the flowing robes worn by Connie Nielsen, with their elaborate cross-laced ribbons - be very surprised if the Noble Roman Matron look isn't in this season.

Police arrested an opposition leader, journalists and members of the youth resistance movement and set up checkpoints on all roads in and out of Pozarevac - where the Yugoslav president grew up and has a home - to prevent opposition supporters and political leaders arriving for a major opposition rally. But around 100 members of the Youth Resistance Movement, Otpor, and other anti-Milosevic activists slipped past the cordon to interrupt a hastily convened counter-meeting set up by officials in Pozarevac's central square. By mid-afternoon, it was the scene of an extraordinary stand-off, with the banner-waving anti-Milosevic protesters on one side and Socialist party officials from the city seeking to address 100 or so party stalwarts on the other. A small group of men in black trousers, black leather jackets and sunglasses - the usual garb of men working as Milosevic family bodyguards - moved to within inches of the jeering protesters. The demonstrators did not shift or back away, but continued distributing leaflets and brandishing their flags and placards, bearing the clenched fist symbol of Otpor. One 23-year-old Otpor protester said: \"We want to show our resistance to the system. Milosevic is afraid of the youth of Otpor. We have parents. We have relatives. We have so many people who know us and know we are not the terrorists which the regime calls us. We just want to live like ordinary people.\" A hundred yards from the stand-off, the Serbian minister of the interior, Veljko Stoiljkovic, watched, as did several dozen young men wearing T-shirts with the Serbian national flag. It was as if they might be waiting for a signal. Pozarevac is a haven for the Milosevic family and its enterprises. Marko Milosevic runs the Madonna disco, which has the reputation as the hottest nightclub in the Balkans, a cybercafe and coffee shop called Passage in the town. Many of President Milosevic's friends from childhood in Pozarevac have become significant figures in his regime. The interior minister is among this group, as was Zika Petrovic, the recently assassinated head of Yugoslav Airlines JAP, who was gunned down in Belgrade just over a week ago. Several domestic and foreign journalists and cameramen, who had also slipped into the town through the police cordon, watched as the stand-off continued. Every minute threatened to explode into violent confrontation, if either side made a wrong move. The authorities had sought in every way to block the rally, held on Victory Day, which traditionally celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. A lorry taking stage and sound equipment into the town was stopped en route shortly after midnight yesterday, said Dra gan Curcija, an official from the opposition democratic party in Pozarevac. An opposition leader, Nenad Canak from the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, was arrested early yesterday morning on his way from Novi Sad to Pozarevac. In Belgrade, opposition leaders held an emergency meeting after coaches they had ordered to take them to the rally failed to turn up or were sent back to Belgrade by police at checkpoints. The non-government radio station B292 and the Belgrade television station Studio B, controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, were taken off the air. Opposition leaders said they would hold a major demonstration in the capital within days to protest at yesterday's events. The incident that sparked this crisis happened last week in Pozarevac, when three members of the Otpor movement became involved in a fracas with bodyguards of Milosevic's son Marko. They were arrested, held beyond the maximum legal detention period and appeared to have been beaten when they appeared before an investigating magistrate on Monday.

Many young anti- Milosevic activists belong to the resistance movement, Otpor, whichburst on to the political scene in November. Formed as an underground movement, Otpor now commands support from more than 20,000 young people across the country, particularly in university towns. Activists claim that Mr Milosevic fears Otpor because of the movement's daring and energy. The crisis in Serbia yesterday was sparked by the arrest of three members of the resistance movement, but it was just the latest incident in which Otpor supporters have deliberately provoked the regime. Almost every week in recent months Otpor activists have organised actions: handing out leaflets, holding meetings or anti-Milosevic street theatre and pasting their clenched fist posters on walls across the country. Almost every week, in response, men in plain clothes have attacked Otpor activists found with leaflets and posters.

I always said that winning doesn't matter in literature but now that I've won I think it's great\".</p> <p>She said the first thing she would buy with the prize money was a new pair of running shoes.</p> <p>The four-year-old IMPAC award is the biggest for a single work of fiction. Funded by the US management consultancy Improved Management Profitability and Control, it is run by Dublin corporation libraries department.</p> <p>It has not yet acquired the prestige of the Booker or of the Prix Goncourt, which gives only 50 francs (about \u00a35). But it has come to be nicknamed the \"honeypot prize\" because of the avid worldwide entry it draws.</p> <p>Ms Barker was up against two other Barkers - Pat and Clive. The Bs alone among her 104 competitors included Nicholson Baker, Julian Barnes, Ronan Bennett, Judy Blume, William Boyd and Anita Brookner.</p> <p>Among heavyweights lower down the alphabet were Sebastian Faulks, Nadine Gordimer, Robert Harris, Nick Hornby, Milan Kundera, Hanif Kureishi, Penelope Lively, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, William Trevor and Tom Wolfe. The shortlist of seven included Roth's I Married a Communist, Morrison's Paradise, and Cormac McCarthy's Cities of the Plain.</p> <p>In singling out Wide Open, a a tale of two estranged brothers on the isle of Sheppey, the judges said it focused on marginal lives, the dispossessed and the apparently mad. They praised its \"manic energy and taut eloquence worthy of a large, serious and global readership\" and its stunning manipulation of language.</p> <p>\"Wide Open is word perfect, witty and ironic. Its dialogue sparkles and its chiselled sentences display both a razor-sharp comic sensibility and flawless structure,\" they said.</p> <p>Ms Barker said: \"I am greatly influenced by where I live in the Hackney Downs. It's full of life with people always shouting in the street at each other - just like I tend to do.\"</p> <p>In an interview earlier this year, Ms Barker said she had been a \"morose\" teenager after her parents emigrated to South Africa when she was nine and split up there. She returned to Britain with her mother when she was 15. \"Cambridge [university] was a disaster for me. People were very cruel.</p> <p>\"There's this huge sterotype in fiction about what a normal person is. I often feel as if writers are trying to write about normal people, or a concept of normality, so that everyone will be comforted. Well, I'm not interested in comforting people.\"</p> <p>She also indicated that her publishers, Faber and Faber, may be disappointed if they hope to capitalise on the prize by getting her to give literary readings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A book praised by a critic last year as \"too good\" to win the \u00a321,000 Booker Prize yesterday won instead the world's richest fiction prize worth \u00a375,000. Nicola Barker, 34 - who has so far not made large sums from writing - carried off the Irish IMPAC literary award for her novel Wide Open against a formidable field which included Philip Roth and Toni Morrison. Ms Barker, who lives in Hackney, east London, said: \"I'll have to pick myself up off the floor. I always said that winning doesn't matter in literature but now that I've won I think it's great\". She said the first thing she would buy with the prize money was a new pair of running shoes. The four-year-old IMPAC award is the biggest for a single work of fiction. Funded by the US management consultancy Improved Management Profitability and Control, it is run by Dublin corporation libraries department. It has not yet acquired the prestige of the Booker or of the Prix Goncourt, which gives only 50 francs (about \u00a35). But it has come to be nicknamed the \"honeypot prize\" because of the avid worldwide entry it draws. Ms Barker was up against two other Barkers - Pat and Clive. The Bs alone among her 104 competitors included Nicholson Baker, Julian Barnes, Ronan Bennett, Judy Blume, William Boyd and Anita Brookner. Among heavyweights lower down the alphabet were Sebastian Faulks, Nadine Gordimer, Robert Harris, Nick Hornby, Milan Kundera, Hanif Kureishi, Penelope Lively, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, William Trevor and Tom Wolfe. The shortlist of seven included Roth's I Married a Communist, Morrison's Paradise, and Cormac McCarthy's Cities of the Plain. In singling out Wide Open, a a tale of two estranged brothers on the isle of Sheppey, the judges said it focused on marginal lives, the dispossessed and the apparently mad. They praised its \"manic energy and taut eloquence worthy of a large, serious and global readership\" and its stunning manipulation of language. \"Wide Open is word perfect, witty and ironic. Its dialogue sparkles and its chiselled sentences display both a razor-sharp comic sensibility and flawless structure,\" they said. Ms Barker said: \"I am greatly influenced by where I live in the Hackney Downs. It's full of life with people always shouting in the street at each other - just like I tend to do.\" In an interview earlier this year, Ms Barker said she had been a \"morose\" teenager after her parents emigrated to South Africa when she was nine and split up there. She returned to Britain with her mother when she was 15. \"Cambridge [university] was a disaster for me. People were very cruel. \"There's this huge sterotype in fiction about what a normal person is. I often feel as if writers are trying to write about normal people, or a concept of normality, so that everyone will be comforted. Well, I'm not interested in comforting people.\" She also indicated that her publishers, Faber and Faber, may be disappointed if they hope to capitalise on the prize by getting her to give literary readings.",

Then when he doesn't perform they hammer the selectors and want him replaced by another young prospect.

Then of course Atherton made the mistake of greedily hanging on to the job of England skipper for a record number of Tests.

The authors criticise the way in which doctors routinely took human material from dead children for a variety of purposes and kept large collections without the knowledge of parents or the public. The hearts of 170 children at the Bristol hospital were removed during postmortem examinations and kept for educational purposes without parents' knowledge, causing great distress to those parents when they later learned that they had buried their children with organs missing. Details of the practice emerged during investigations into high death rates of children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol hospital between 1984 and 1995. The inquiry into heart surgery at the hospital, which is being led by Professor Ian Kennedy, was widened to include the way organ removal was handled and today's report focuses on this issue. </p> <p>The report found that during the inquiry's terms of reference and indeed for some time after \"there was in essence, a professional arrogance, justified when necessary by the recourse to traditional paternalism, that parents, on this view, are best kept from the details but would be thankful if they knew what was being done\". </p> <p>The cause lay in two conflicting attitudes: that of the parents of a recently deceased child who continue to regard the organs as part of the child's body and therefore still the child; and that of the pathologists and clinicians for whom such material was simply a dehumanised specimen. </p> <p>The study called for a strict code of practice to be introduced to help solve this conflict which would be based on two fundamental guiding principles: firstly and most importantly, respect for parents and their dead child; secondly, the value of continued access to human material for the advancement of medical care and treatment. </p> <p>It recommended that parents should be told exactly what was happening and what the benefits would be from organ removal, as well as making sure that parents were told in an appropriate manner and at a suitable time. Evidence within the report showed that parents found themselves asked to discuss the signing of papers at a time which was too close to the death of their child, when they were \"clearly and understandably unable to comprehend what was being put to them\". The report recommended: \"Obtaining parents' consent should be seen as a process, and not just a signing of a form. As part of that process parents should be allowed proper time to reflect and be informed that they may change their mind until such time as they sign a form indicating their consent.\" It was also recommended that parents should be told that they may refuse consent for the retention of organs and be able to do so in a supportive atmosphere where they had access to clear and comprehensible information.</p> <p>The report also described the law regulating the removal, retention, use and disposal of human material as \"obscure, uncertain and arcane\" and recommended that it should be amended or clarified. </p> <p>Speaking at the launch of the interim report in London, inquiry chairman Professor Ian Kennedy said it was important to recognise that the issues that the report focused upon were not confined to Bristol, but were national and should therefore have national effect. Prof Kennedy said the practice of excluding parents was \"indefensible\". He continued: \"Parents should no longer be left out, they must be at the centre\" and he added \"we must recognise that the practice of the past was a product of the culture of the past\". Prof Kennedy emphasised it was important to avoid blaming individuals, saying \"that is not a proxy for real accountability, furthermore it is a barren substitute for real progress. The challenge for us is to look beyond the individual to the culture in which that individual works.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Doctors at Bristol Royal Infirmary who removed hundreds of organs from dead children without parental knowledge or consent had acted with \"professional arrogance\", according to an inquiry released today. The interim report recommended a strict new code of practice to regulate the removal and retention of organs and the treatment of bereaved parents. It includes almost 70 recommendations covering coroners' inquests and postmortem examinations carried out by hospitals. The authors criticise the way in which doctors routinely took human material from dead children for a variety of purposes and kept large collections without the knowledge of parents or the public. The hearts of 170 children at the Bristol hospital were removed during postmortem examinations and kept for educational purposes without parents' knowledge, causing great distress to those parents when they later learned that they had buried their children with organs missing. Details of the practice emerged during investigations into high death rates of children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol hospital between 1984 and 1995. The inquiry into heart surgery at the hospital, which is being led by Professor Ian Kennedy, was widened to include the way organ removal was handled and today's report focuses on this issue. The report found that during the inquiry's terms of reference and indeed for some time after \"there was in essence, a professional arrogance, justified when necessary by the recourse to traditional paternalism, that parents, on this view, are best kept from the details but would be thankful if they knew what was being done\". The cause lay in two conflicting attitudes: that of the parents of a recently deceased child who continue to regard the organs as part of the child's body and therefore still the child; and that of the pathologists and clinicians for whom such material was simply a dehumanised specimen. The study called for a strict code of practice to be introduced to help solve this conflict which would be based on two fundamental guiding principles: firstly and most importantly, respect for parents and their dead child; secondly, the value of continued access to human material for the advancement of medical care and treatment. It recommended that parents should be told exactly what was happening and what the benefits would be from organ removal, as well as making sure that parents were told in an appropriate manner and at a suitable time. Evidence within the report showed that parents found themselves asked to discuss the signing of papers at a time which was too close to the death of their child, when they were \"clearly and understandably unable to comprehend what was being put to them\". The report recommended: \"Obtaining parents' consent should be seen as a process, and not just a signing of a form. As part of that process parents should be allowed proper time to reflect and be informed that they may change their mind until such time as they sign a form indicating their consent.\" It was also recommended that parents should be told that they may refuse consent for the retention of organs and be able to do so in a supportive atmosphere where they had access to clear and comprehensible information. The report also described the law regulating the removal, retention, use and disposal of human material as \"obscure, uncertain and arcane\" and recommended that it should be amended or clarified. Speaking at the launch of the interim report in London, inquiry chairman Professor Ian Kennedy said it was important to recognise that the issues that the report focused upon were not confined to Bristol, but were national and should therefore have national effect. Prof Kennedy said the practice of excluding parents was \"indefensible\". He continued: \"Parents should no longer be left out, they must be at the centre\" and he added \"we must recognise that the practice of the past was a product of the culture of the past\". Prof Kennedy emphasised it was important to avoid blaming individuals, saying \"that is not a proxy for real accountability, furthermore it is a barren substitute for real progress. The challenge for us is to look beyond the individual to the culture in which that individual works.\"",

Details of the practice emerged during investigations into high death rates of children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol hospital between 1984 and 1995.

Evidence within the report showed that parents found themselves asked to discuss the signing of papers at a time which was too close to the death of their child, when they were \"clearly and understandably unable to comprehend what was being put to them\". The report recommended: \"Obtaining parents' consent should be seen as a process, and not just a signing of a form. As part of that process parents should be allowed proper time to reflect and be informed that they may change their mind until such time as they sign a form indicating their consent.\" It was also recommended that parents should be told that they may refuse consent for the retention of organs and be able to do so in a supportive atmosphere where they had access to clear and comprehensible information.</p> <p>The report also described the law regulating the removal, retention, use and disposal of human material as \"obscure, uncertain and arcane\" and recommended that it should be amended or clarified. </p> <p>Speaking at the launch of the interim report in London, inquiry chairman Professor Ian Kennedy said it was important to recognise that the issues that the report focused upon were not confined to Bristol, but were national and should therefore have national effect.

He continued: \"Parents should no longer be left out, they must be at the centre\" and he added \"we must recognise that the practice of the past was a product of the culture of the past\".

The interim report recommended a strict new code of practice to regulate the removal and retention of organs and the treatment of bereaved parents. It includes almost 70 recommendations covering coroners' inquests and postmortem examinations carried out by hospitals. The authors criticise the way in which doctors routinely took human material from dead children for a variety of purposes and kept large collections without the knowledge of parents or the public.

Details of the practice emerged during investigations into high death rates of children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol hospital between 1984 and 1995. The inquiry into heart surgery at the hospital, which is being led by Professor Ian Kennedy, was widened to include the way organ removal was handled and today's report focuses on this issue. The report found that during the inquiry's terms of reference and indeed for some time after \"there was in essence, a professional arrogance, justified when necessary by the recourse to traditional paternalism, that parents, on this view, are best kept from the details but would be thankful if they knew what was being done\". The cause lay in two conflicting attitudes: that of the parents of a recently deceased child who continue to regard the organs as part of the child's body and therefore still the child; and that of the pathologists and clinicians for whom such material was simply a dehumanised specimen. The study called for a strict code of practice to be introduced to help solve this conflict which would be based on two fundamental guiding principles: firstly and most importantly, respect for parents and their dead child; secondly, the value of continued access to human material for the advancement of medical care and treatment. It recommended that parents should be told exactly what was happening and what the benefits would be from organ removal, as well as making sure that parents were told in an appropriate manner and at a suitable time. Evidence within the report showed that parents found themselves asked to discuss the signing of papers at a time which was too close to the death of their child, when they were \"clearly and understandably unable to comprehend what was being put to them\".

      "bodyText": "Survivors of the Paddington rail disaster have demanded that the government heeds lessons from the inquiry which opens in London today. Speaking this morning ahead of the inquest into the train crash in which 31 people died, solicitors for the survivors and bereaved relatives called on the government to treat the inquiry with respect and use it as a \"blueprint for the future\" of rail safety. The inquiry comes amid fresh anger after yesterday's Crown Prosecution Service decision not to bring manslaughter prosecutions over the crash. A spokeswoman for the Ladbroke Grove solicitors group said: \"We're looking for this inquiry to provide a blueprint for the future. The government and rail companies must treat the inquiry with respect and make money available to implement recommendations.\" At a news conference in Westminster, crash survivors spoke of their anger and \"disgust\" at the state of Britain's rail network. Evelyn Crosskey and Pam Warren called on rail companies to invest more of their profits in safety. Fellow survivor Emily Schwartz from the USA said the firms should be punished for their \"criminal\" actions. Lord Cullen, who chaired the inquiry into the Piper Alpha North Sea oil platform disaster in 1988, said today: \"We should never lose sight of how it was that this inquiry came to be set up. We owe it to all those who have suffered in any way as a result of this disaster to make sure that its lessons are fully learnt and effective recommendations are made for the future safety of all who travel on this country's railways.\" The morning rush-hour accident happened when a Thames train passed through a red light at Ladbroke Grove, two miles outside Paddington station in west London. The Thames train, driven by Michael Hodder, 31, collided almost head-on with a London-bound Great Western high-speed train. Both Mr Hodder and the Great Western driver Brian Cooper, 52, were among those killed. More than 400 people were injured in the accident. The health and safety executive has already published three interim accident reports. The third of these, which came out in mid-April, said the initial cause of the accident still appeared to be that the Thames train had passed a red light at signal 109. But it added that the reasons the train had passed the red light were likely to be complex and that \"any action or omission on the part of the driver was only one such factor in a failure involving many contributory factors\". After today's opening statement from leading counsel Robert Owen, statements will follow on Thursday from the Ladbroke Grove solicitors group, Railtrack and the two train companies directly involved, Thames and Great Western. The inquiry will begin hearing evidence next Monday. Among witnesses expected to appear will be passengers on the two trains, rail industry employees and health and safety inspectors.",

      "body": "<p>When my father was 33, he was fronting a family of five. My mother was my mother when she was 21. This was the pattern of their generation. The pattern of mine was to marry late, have children late . . . there was an awful lot of bachelorhood to be swum through . . . Ardour dwindled. Three months, six months, 12 months, with the affairs tending to elide. Tina Brown, pointing to a lacuna in my emotional repertoire, would later say that I had never had my heart broken. And I can now recognise that I somewhere harboured an unconscious distrust of love. But at the time it just felt like a process, increasingly familiar and inexorable. Ardour, then diminishing ardour, and constantly starting again.</p> <p>One of the briefest of these affairs, one of the most condensed in time, caused me to pay a visit to my mother in 1977. I said I had a story I wanted to tell her. And a photograph I wanted to show her.</p> <p>- Yes, dear.</p> <p>Nearly three years ago, I said, I had an affair with a young woman called Lamorna. She had been and still was married to a rather older man, Patrick, whom I had known, slightly, for some time.</p> <p>- Yes, dear.</p> <p>I said that Lamorna and I were still friends and that I had recently had lunch with her . . . I did not go on to tell my mother that Lamorna had impressed me with her general bearing and burnish - her beauty, her sanity. Lamorna suffered from manic depression, a condition once frivolously but memorably described by a psychologist as the Arnold Schwarzenegger of mental illnesses.</p> <p>I had seen her, and would again see her, in a state of tranquillised agitation, disorganised in thought, and seemingly beset by small fears, small enemies. That day at lunch it was I who was agitated (a current matter of the heart); and I remember Lamorna suggesting that I order something nonmonolithic, like a stew or a fricassee, rather than face the edifice of a steak or a chop. She knew about agitation . . . I thought she had never seemed stronger or happier. I thought she had found equilibrium. And I was wrong.</p> <p>- She talked about her daughter. And then there was the photograph, Mum. She gave me the photograph.</p> <p>- Yes, dear.</p> <p>It was ready in my pocket. It showed a two-year-old girl in a dark flower dress, smocked at the chest, with short, puffed sleeves and pink trim. She had fine blonde hair. Her smile was demure: pleased, but quietly pleased.</p> <p>My mother snatched it from my hand.</p> <p>- Lamorna says I'm her father. What do you think, Mum?</p> <p>She held the photograph at various distances from her eyes. Without looking up she said,</p> <p>- Definitely.</p> <p>- What should I do?</p> <p>- Nothing. Don't do anything, dear.</p> <p>In late spring 1995, I had just returned from a three-week book tour of north America . . .</p> <p>My plane had arrived four or five hours late. The apr\u00e8s book tour condition, I think, would be indistinguishable from extreme jet lag, with or without the extreme jet lag that usually accompanies it. Alone in the studio apartment, I went through my mail. One letter caused me to sit down suddenly when I was halfway through its first sentence. This, I might have murmured to my ghost, is probably for you . . .</p> <p>That night, carrying the letter in my chest pocket, I escorted Isabel to the Coronet in Notting Hill Gate, where we saw An Awfully Big Adventure - the screen adaptation of Beryl Bainbridge's novel. And I'm very sorry, Beryl, but I slept through most of it, and then walked out. We regrouped for dinner at that pizza/pasta place just down the street. I took the letter from my jacket and passed it across the table.</p> <p>Isabel finished reading it and said,</p> <p>- . . . Good.</p> <p>- There isn't any reason, is there, why this shouldn't be a great thing?</p> <p>- None.</p> <p>I rang my mother in the morning and sent her mind back almost 20 years. She said immediately,</p> <p>- I've still got the photograph.</p> <p>- Do you think you could dig it out, Mum?</p> <p>- It's here on the dressing table, she said.</p> <p>And now it's on the shelf in the study, within arm's reach of my desk.</p> <p>I felt it was important to tell the story in the simplest possible terms. My interlocutors, after all, were aged 11 and 10: number one son, Louis, and number two son, Jacob. What I was about to reveal to them was a family matter, a private matter, but I knew it couldn't remain private. There was a feeling among my intimates that I should wait, that \"the boys weren't ready\" for the news. But it seemed to me that I didn't have a choice. The Fourth Estate wasn't going to care whether or not the boys were ready. Over and above this, though, I thought that the boys were ready, had always been ready. I trusted the morality of my sons.</p> <p>I said, I'm going to tell a story. There was once a little girl called Delilah. She had a brother and a mother and a father. When she was two years old her mother died. Her mother killed herself. She hanged herself. Delilah grew up with her brother, raised by her father, who remarried. Then when she was 18, it was revealed that her father wasn't her real father. And so suddenly it seemed that she had no parents at all.</p> <p>Louis and Jacob spoke in one voice. They had a habit, that night, of speaking in one voice.</p> <p>- Poor her, they said.</p> <p>- Well, boys, the real father . . . is me.</p> <p>- Good, they said.</p> <p>The meeting was set for seven o'clock in the bar of a Knightsbridge hotel. I arrived 20 minutes early, accompanied by an indispensable Isabel. My hands were shaking. We sat on a sofa among lamps and low tables, doilies, antimacassars. I watched the door. She knew what I looked like. And I knew that she was 19 and would arrive on the very stroke of the hour.</p> <p>This time the day before, in the same bar of the same hotel, I had had a long conversation with Delilah's father, or co-father, Patrick Seale. He was the author of several books; he was also the author of the letter in my jacket pocket. Patrick told me that his original plan had been to tell Delilah everything when she turned 21. Family politics had intervened (there was the stepmother, and two further children), and now Delilah knew. She had known for some months.</p> <p>And how had she reacted? Patrick described a process that began in grief and had since moved on towards something more resilient. In his super-evolved fashion, he had given Delilah a box of my books (a kind of kit) plus a video cassette of an hour-long interview. I would be coming at her partly as a mediated being, mediated by myself - and others: Delilah would presumably be aware that I had abandoned my sons to go and live with an heiress in New York, the better to squander my advances on a Liberace smile . . .</p> <p>But this was a secondary or tertiary matter. At the moment of revelation, she must have been wholly indifferent to my identity (and never mind its carapace). When I tried to imagine it, I saw her aswim in a panic of lost connection. The connection - with her father, her brother - seemed lost, but it wasn't. And here was another connection waiting to be made. I thought, too, of the courage she would need on this summer evening as she mounted the steps and opened the door.</p> <p>She entered.</p> <p>- It's you, said Isabel.</p> <p>Then hugs and kisses for the girl with my face.</p> <p>\"I'm very pleased and proud that you've taken it this way,\" I told the boys. And again the eerie unison, with the frowning duo saying: \"Why would we not?\" Yes, exactly. Why would you not? And when a day or two afterwards Delilah came to dinner for the first time, the boys leapt to the sound of the buzzer and ran upstairs to open the door and let her in.</p> <p>All the press coverage wore an indulgent smile: it beamed fondly on us. No doubt it was Delilah's youth - her manifest innocence and vulnerability - that softened the mood. I was very glad that they hadn't tried to hurt her. But I sat through it all in the way that one tolerates (counting one's immediate blessings) the tearful interlude of a notoriously violent drunk. Our story did the rounds of the dailies and was picked up for more thoughtful treatment at the weekend. Then came another revelation.</p> <p>In his essay on The Old Curiosity Shop, GK Chesterton talks about the kind of criticism or commentary that makes a writer \"jump out of his boots\". Such an occurrence is vanishingly rare. Nine out of 10 writers, I imagine, get through life without once experiencing it. But it does happen, and it happened to me. In the Observer, the novelist Maureen Freely staged a straightforward retrospective of my fiction and noted the punctual arrival - just in time for my third novel, Success (1978) - of a stream of lost or wandering daughters and putative or fugitive fathers, and that these figures recurred, with variations, in every subsequent book.</p> <p>There was nothing I could do about this diagnosis. It chimed with something Patrick had said during our first talk on the telephone: \"I expect it's been in the back of your mind.\" Yes, exactly: in the back of my mind. Your writing comes from the back of your mind, where thoughts are unformulated and anxiety is silent. I felt there was something almost embarrassing about the neatness and obviousness of the Freely interpretation. But it also sharply consoled me, because it meant that I had been with Delilah in spirit far more than I knew.</p> <p>Delilah was a two-year-old standing on the stairs. Her older brother Orlando, who led the way, could see the hanging body. And it was Patrick who had to go in and \"take her down\". That void world up there is, of course, the central fact behind Delilah's origin and evolution, and not the little mystery of the lost-found father, which is good, good, only good. No mother, but more than one father, now - and much else. It does go on. When the revelation came, Delilah forfeited technical consanguinity with her half-brother and half-sister. But there were two more, a half-brother and another half-brother, waiting, like a team, just as they wait for the sound of the buzzer and then run upstairs to let her in.</p> <p>I had always wanted a girl and suddenly there she was, like a mirror. For 17 years I had been worrying about her, in the back of my mind. Time, thus affronted (I thought), would give us work to do; but it hasn't been like that. Love flowed (and was soon declared). And now she and I can say the words in unison: why would it not?</p> <p>Although I now had Delilah, I had not raised Delilah. And I wanted to raise a girl. I was desperate to see how the other half lived. [On November 8 1997, Fernanda Amis was born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington.]</p> <p>Our first visitor the next day was Delilah Seale. On her way up, she had stopped at the in-house florist's on the ground floor. She said,</p> <p>- When she was wrapping the flowers, the woman asked me, Nephew or niece?</p> <p>- What did you tell her?</p> <p>Delilah's words made me happy, but they also made me realise how many days and nights I had spent on the planet.</p> <p>- No, sister, I said. Sister.</p> <p>During school vacations, with various friends, we cruised all day. The method: you wrote out visiting cards, with your name and number, and distributed them, by the tens of thousands, to every girl you could find on the London Underground. Then you hurried home to wait, often in vain, for your one or two calls.</p> <p>Concentration was a fortress it never occurred to me to scale; and I remember gaping through hours of tuition without a thought in my head. I didn't like working. What I liked was bunking off school and hanging out with my friend Rob, and betting in betting shops (not the horses: the dogs), and mincing up and down the King's Road in skintight velves and grimy silk scarves and haunting a coffee bar called the Picasso, and smoking hash (then \u00a38 an ounce) and trying to pick up girls. One time I said,</p> <p>- Let's go down King's.</p> <p>Rob turned away. I should point out here that Rob was and is about my height.</p> <p>- Come on. What's the matter? We'll pick up girls.</p> <p>- Where? In the Picasso?</p> <p>- In the Picasso.</p> <p>- I can't cope with the Picasso. I can hardly cope with being in my room.</p> <p>As usual we had smoked ourselves into a state of clinical paranoia.</p> <p>- What's wrong with the Picasso? Okay, we won't go to the Picasso. We'll pick up girls somewhere else.</p> <p>- Where?</p> <p>- Uh, that other place. Beyond the Picasso.</p> <p>- But we'll end up in the Picasso.</p> <p>- We won't go to the Picasso.</p> <p>- I always feel such a short-arse in the Picasso.</p> <p>- Me too. That's why we won't try and pick up girls in the Picasso. Come on.</p> <p>- Okay. But I don't want to end up short-arseing round the Picasso trying to pick up girls.</p> <p>But that's what we would end up doing. Whole school terms went by like this: wondering whether to go to the Picasso.</p> <p>A while later, and very briefly, Rob and I hit the deb scene. It looked good at first but here we faced the giantesses of the gentry. The women were all elongated by centuries of huge meals, and so were all the men, and we felt, we admitted, as if we were walking around between everybody else's legs.</p> <p>And my academic career started to fall into a pattern: one O-level every other year. I didn't have much time for reading, but when I did read, I read comics and, after I'd done that, I reread them.</p> <p>Quietly, patiently, unobtrusively reeking, I lay there on the bed as my mother yelled my A-level English result up the stairs: \"You failed.\" I arose, and spent the rest of the day transferring a sock from one end of the room to the other . . .</p> <p>I did claim to myself that I wanted to be a writer. So what did I do all the time? Did I dream and doodle, did I read, did I pray? No. I was groping my way back across the bedroom, looking for the other sock.</p> <p>At the party where I first exchanged whispers with Lamorna Seale, the attraction was so immediate that we disappeared into some unattended shadows; and when I emerged into the light, my girlfriend, Julie Kavanagh, burst into tears.</p> <p>\"What's the matter with you?\" I asked, with defiant innocence - my mouth smothered in lipstick. (This was one of the few occasions when I rivalled my father, whose sexual recklessness often approached the psychotic.)</p> <p>Tomorrow: my cousin, victim of Frederick West</p> <p>\u00a9 Martin Amis 2000.

I was very glad that they hadn't tried to hurt her. But I sat through it all in the way that one tolerates (counting one's immediate blessings) the tearful interlude of a notoriously violent drunk. Our story did the rounds of the dailies and was picked up for more thoughtful treatment at the weekend. Then came another revelation. In his essay on The Old Curiosity Shop, GK Chesterton talks about the kind of criticism or commentary that makes a writer \"jump out of his boots\". Such an occurrence is vanishingly rare. Nine out of 10 writers, I imagine, get through life without once experiencing it. But it does happen, and it happened to me. In the Observer, the novelist Maureen Freely staged a straightforward retrospective of my fiction and noted the punctual arrival - just in time for my third novel, Success (1978) - of a stream of lost or wandering daughters and putative or fugitive fathers, and that these figures recurred, with variations, in every subsequent book. There was nothing I could do about this diagnosis. It chimed with something Patrick had said during our first talk on the telephone: \"I expect it's been in the back of your mind.\" Yes, exactly: in the back of my mind. Your writing comes from the back of your mind, where thoughts are unformulated and anxiety is silent. I felt there was something almost embarrassing about the neatness and obviousness of the Freely interpretation. But it also sharply consoled me, because it meant that I had been with Delilah in spirit far more than I knew. Delilah was a two-year-old standing on the stairs. Her older brother Orlando, who led the way, could see the hanging body. And it was Patrick who had to go in and \"take her down\". That void world up there is, of course, the central fact behind Delilah's origin and evolution, and not the little mystery of the lost-found father, which is good, good, only good. No mother, but more than one father, now - and much else. It does go on. When the revelation came, Delilah forfeited technical consanguinity with her half-brother and half-sister. But there were two more, a half-brother and another half-brother, waiting, like a team, just as they wait for the sound of the buzzer and then run upstairs to let her in. I had always wanted a girl and suddenly there she was, like a mirror. For 17 years I had been worrying about her, in the back of my mind. Time, thus affronted (I thought), would give us work to do; but it hasn't been like that. Love flowed (and was soon declared). And now she and I can say the words in unison: why would it not? Although I now had Delilah, I had not raised Delilah. And I wanted to raise a girl. I was desperate to see how the other half lived. [On November 8 1997, Fernanda Amis was born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington.] Our first visitor the next day was Delilah Seale. On her way up, she had stopped at the in-house florist's on the ground floor. She said, - When she was wrapping the flowers, the woman asked me, Nephew or niece? - What did you tell her? Delilah's words made me happy, but they also made me realise how many days and nights I had spent on the planet. - No, sister, I said. Sister. During school vacations, with various friends, we cruised all day. The method: you wrote out visiting cards, with your name and number, and distributed them, by the tens of thousands, to every girl you could find on the London Underground. Then you hurried home to wait, often in vain, for your one or two calls. Concentration was a fortress it never occurred to me to scale; and I remember gaping through hours of tuition without a thought in my head. I didn't like working. What I liked was bunking off school and hanging out with my friend Rob, and betting in betting shops (not the horses: the dogs), and mincing up and down the King's Road in skintight velves and grimy silk scarves and haunting a coffee bar called the Picasso, and smoking hash (then \u00a38 an ounce) and trying to pick up girls. One time I said, - Let's go down King's. Rob turned away. I should point out here that Rob was and is about my height. - Come on. What's the matter? We'll pick up girls. - Where? In the Picasso? - In the Picasso. - I can't cope with the Picasso. I can hardly cope with being in my room. As usual we had smoked ourselves into a state of clinical paranoia. - What's wrong with the Picasso? Okay, we won't go to the Picasso. We'll pick up girls somewhere else. - Where? - Uh, that other place. Beyond the Picasso. - But we'll end up in the Picasso. - We won't go to the Picasso. - I always feel such a short-arse in the Picasso. - Me too. That's why we won't try and pick up girls in the Picasso. Come on. - Okay. But I don't want to end up short-arseing round the Picasso trying to pick up girls. But that's what we would end up doing. Whole school terms went by like this: wondering whether to go to the Picasso. A while later, and very briefly, Rob and I hit the deb scene. It looked good at first but here we faced the giantesses of the gentry. The women were all elongated by centuries of huge meals, and so were all the men, and we felt, we admitted, as if we were walking around between everybody else's legs. And my academic career started to fall into a pattern: one O-level every other year. I didn't have much time for reading, but when I did read, I read comics and, after I'd done that, I reread them. Quietly, patiently, unobtrusively reeking, I lay there on the bed as my mother yelled my A-level English result up the stairs: \"You failed.\" I arose, and spent the rest of the day transferring a sock from one end of the room to the other . . . I did claim to myself that I wanted to be a writer. So what did I do all the time? Did I dream and doodle, did I read, did I pray? No. I was groping my way back across the bedroom, looking for the other sock. At the party where I first exchanged whispers with Lamorna Seale, the attraction was so immediate that we disappeared into some unattended shadows; and when I emerged into the light, my girlfriend, Julie Kavanagh, burst into tears. \"What's the matter with you?\" I asked, with defiant innocence - my mouth smothered in lipstick. (This was one of the few occasions when I rivalled my father, whose sexual recklessness often approached the psychotic.) Tomorrow: my cousin, victim of Frederick West \u00a9 Martin Amis 2000.

It's part of the post-modern revisionism we're going through.\" Today's planners and architects have access to what he calls \"the computer fly-through\" - the ability to look into a screen and take a virtual route through any proposed new development. They can see how it will look from ground level, rather than the distant, god-like perspective of 1960s planners so effectively reflected in Merilion's photographs. \"It ought to mean that we get it right,\" says Holyoak. But he still has doubts about the proposed \u00a3400m replacement for the 1960s' Bull Ring. He's concerned about the size of the \"fortress-like\" malls colonising more and more public space, the moving of market stalls further away from the city centre, and the absence of much provision beyond shopping. There are no plans for any homes, for instance. \"The city council's policy is to encourage mixed-use developments,\" Holyoak says, \"but it doesn't seem to be enforcing it in this case.\" All the same, Holyoak knows that the new development is bound to be seen as a vast improvement on the dank passageways, the litter-strewn walkways and the grey, rain-stained concrete which so mocks the faded dreams of those god-like postwar planners. Even Tom Merilion knows it, too. \u00b7 Tom Merilion's photographs, Concrete Dreams, are on show at the Midlands Arts Centre (0121-440 4221) in the city's Cannon Hill Park until June 4.",

Forty-five Labour MPs defied appeals from Tony Blair to back the plans amid backbench warnings that ministers have \"stopped listening\" to grassroots opinion. Days after last week's local and mayoral election defeats, MPs staged one of the biggest revolts of the parliament. Labour and Lib Dem rebels had mustered 99 votes to the government's 307, a majority of 208, in the first key vote, as the Tories abstained. London's independent mayor and MP for Brent East, Ken Livingstone, was among those voting against the government. A further rebel Labour amendment - seeking to allow transfer of existing property, rights or liabilities only to a non profit making company and requiring Parliament's approval of any scheme - was defeated by 308 to 248, a government majority of only 60. As a succession of MPs rose to condemn the move during the final stages of the transport bill feelings against John Prescott's \u00a3500m plans were raised still further by claims that the private sector may eventually get control of 75% of Nats, not the 51% originally envisaged. Loyalists countered that the dilution of the government's shares would only be used as a means of raising extra capital via a shares issue and would not affect the control mechanisms which ministers will retain.

The deputy prime minister and his allies waged a fierce rearguard action in defence of the public private partnership (PPP) scheme which has been condemned as the worst option by the Labour-dominated transport select committee, despite Mr Prescott's assurances that his plan will bring vital private capital and management skills to Nats. The deal will protect air safety in Britain's ever-more crowded skies - where traffic rises 5% a year - and will protect staff as well as the public interest by a tough but separate regulatory regime, loyalists argued.

And if we are talking about cinema as an artform, those are the correct priorities. But in terms of the movie business, far more attention will paid to the number of times The Grinch trailer gets downloaded than stories of addled hacks and PRs schmoozing along the Croisette, or earnest assessments of the political significance of Bread And Roses, Ken Loach's first LA-set effort. </p> <p>When in doubt, blame George Lucas. Remember what happened when the first trailer for the woeful Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace appeared in November 1998? It turned out that crowds were paying the full $10 entrance to The Siege or Meet Joe Black, and then rushing out before the main feature began (understandable, naturally, in the case of Meet Joe Black). Lucas decided to premiere the second trailer on the internet. Within the first five days, it had been downloaded 3.5 million times. That record was demolished by the first teaser for Lord Of The Rings - the first in the trilogy isn't even released until next year - which was downloaded 1.7 million times in its first day. </p> <p>Which might just seem like a gauge of perversity. With a typical home internet connection in the UK, it can take around 45 minutes to load a two-minute trailer with a picture that's either very small or very distorted but a half-decent size. Neither will give you much of a sense of movies as overwhelmingly visual as Lord Of The Rings (and as for watching a whole feature film on the net, it might now be possible, but is it worth any sane person's time?). Sure, connections are quicker and cheaper in the States, but not that much. Normally, you'd be better off waiting to see the trailer in the cinema, but Lord Of The Rings is an internet exclusive. </p> <p>It's easy to see what the studios are getting so excited about. This is hype whose efficacy you can quantify. With ads and other marketing, they have to rely on unreliable research for clues to whether it's working or not. Even tracking internet site hits gives ambiguous information: the same few obsessives could be visiting seven times a day each. But if 3.5 million people download the trailer, that's a minimum number of people desperate to see the film. Which should give the accountants a head start on predicting next year's company results. </p> <p>But what do the people downloading the trailers get, apart from hefty phone bills in the UK? There is an answer in traditional media studies theory. </p> <p>Most early attempts to analyse cinema revolved around treating films as texts - like books, only with moving pictures - full of subtexts, Freudian references or Barthesian signs to be broken down and read. But by the mid-80s, this was considered rather simplistic. In Visible Fictions - first published in 1984 - John Ellis focused on the idea that we experience big movies as a process, of which actually seeing the film is just the final part. It starts when you first hear or read about a film, continues as you hear rumours or see on-set photos, builds through the trailers, magazine covers, interviews with Jonathan Ross until the point when, finally, you pay your money, buy the popcorn and slip in to see the film. Like the best academic theories, it has the merit of sounding like something you always knew, but hadn't quite got around to thinking about. </p> <p>What has happened since has only reinforced Ellis's ideas. These days, with the IMDB, Ain't It Cool News, Mr Showbiz and darkhorizons.com, punters are absorbing far more film news daily than Wardour Street regulars used to get in a week.
