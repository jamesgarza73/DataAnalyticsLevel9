Nor does surrealism do justice to the presence of Caniggia who, if his sore rib withstands a biting Tayside workout this morning, will play in a venue traditionally reserved for Rabs and Boabs when he turns out against Dundee United this afternoon. </p> <p>Six weeks have now passed since jaws, which had long since ceased dropping in Jute City, went slack at the announcement made by Ivano Bonetti, the Dundee manager. \"My aim is to bring Claudio Caniggia to Dens Park.\" </p> <p>The only other Bonetti to have been anywhere near either Tannadice or Dens was the old cat himself, the much-maligned former England goalkeeper, Peter, whose brief career with United in the mid-1970s was mercifully ended when he continued almost without stopping in a north-westerly route to open a B&amp;B on the island of Mull. </p> <p>The contemporary Bonetti is a much more fascinating figure. Italians by the pizza-parlour load seem to have been arriving to sign for Dundee, as have the Georgian international, Giorgi Nemsadze, and the ultimate coup, Senor Caniggia himself. </p> <p>Exactly 12 months ago Dundee's then hard-working and talented, though, alas, merely Scottish manager, Jocky Scott, was told by the club's owners there was not a single ha'penny to spend on players.

It is a stupendously mind-bending scene. </p> <p>Not only this, but the smouldering, beautiful Caniggia spouse, the famed Marianna, has also been in Dundee, brazenly announcing that they both love the industrial sprawl - presumably in comparison to dank, miserable, grey-skied Italy. La Caniggia was reported two weeks ago to be searching for a castle for her family to settle into. </p> <p>Dundee have not always been seen as the old coalman of the Scottish game.

      "body": "<p>England received the strongest possible reminder of this tour's potential for controversy when Andrew Caddick was reported to have had words with an umpire during play here yesterday. </p> <p>According to Sajjad Asghar, who was standing at Caddick's end while he was bowling to the left-handed batsman Akhtar Sarfraz, the fast bowler \"insulted my country\" after the umpire had refused an appeal for a catch behind the wicket. Although there has been a match referee appointed for the game, he has no jurisdiction other than to report such incidents to the Pakistan cricket board once an official complaint had been made in writing. </p> <p>After play had finished for the day, however, Farrukh Zaman, a former Test player himself, confirmed he had received no such complaint and so the chances are that the incident will go no further. If so, England can breathe a sigh of relief. They will have escaped lightly. </p> <p>During the morning session, a hot-air balloon had been inflated on an adjacent sports field and disappeared to the north towards the mountains. On the cricket field, however, the balloon did not go up until late into the final session as the evening haze descended and the light closed in. </p> <p>A fine partnership between Sarfraz and the bulky right-hander Naumanullah Khan had rescued the Governor's side from 13 for three and was already worth 86 when Sarfraz, missed at slip by Graham Thorpe off Darren Gough's bowling when 16 and now 46, appeared to offer a straightforward edge to Alec Stewart. Certainly there was a loud noise. </p> <p>Caddick's celebrations were curtailed, however, by the umpire's lack of interest. Almost immediately the bowler commenced a stream of rhetoric that was to last several overs, directed for the most part at the batsman but, it is now apparent, at the umpire as well. </p> <p>Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, dismissed this as acceptable sledging (if there is such a thing) and a sign that his side showed \"passion\". According to Asghar, a 46-year-old retired banker who speaks excellent English, it was rather more than this. </p> <p>\"He said something bad about my country,\" he said. \"I can't tolerate that. He can abuse me and he can abuse my decisions but he shouldn't say things about my country. He is a guest here. I don't want to report what he said because it would cause problems for him in other parts of the country.\" </p> <p>There speaks a sensible man and would that Shakoor Rana could have employed the same commonsense approach 13 years ago. Now it is to be hoped that Caddick, trivial though he may think all this is, understands a little more the sensitivity that prevails in this part of the world and plays his part by swallowing his pride and apologising to Asghar for any offence caused. The bowler was trying his socks off but he went too far. </p> <p>The team know now that without compromising their competitive edge, they must tread carefully from hereon in. There is, for example, still an undercurrent of dissatisfaction here that the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Lord MacLaurin, will not be attending an England tour for the first time since he took up his appointment three years ago. </p> <p>The fact that it has been decided instead to send the board's deputy chairman, David Morgan, a good man and a top administrator, to the last Test in Karachi will do little to camouflage the perception that the head honcho is ducking out. There may be some apologising needed on that front too. </p> <p>At least the fracas on the field provided a diversion from what was, apart from a fierce and vastly improved new-ball burst from Gough and Caddick, a day of drudgery and substandard England performance. From 241 for five overnight, Graham Thorpe (48) and Craig White (22) started brightly enough but the innings stagnated after both were out, White to a brilliant catch on the long leg boundary as he hooked. </p> <p>Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury ground out an excruciating and meaningless partnership of just eight that took 55 balls, and when the last wicket fell shortly before lunch just 75 further runs had accrued in 2 hours giving a lead of 91. </p> <p>While the England opening pair bowled with such verve at the start, a win inside three days looked a possibility. Once the ball lost its newness, however, Sarfraz (53 not out) and Naumanullah, who was caught at short midwicket from bat and pad for 50 shortly before bad light stopped play with 13 overs left, played extremely well, making the spinners Giles and Salisbury look worryingly ordinary. </p> <p>Pakistan's selectors meanwhile have named a preliminary squad of 18 players, captained by Moin Khan, for next week's first Test in Lahore. It includes no fewer than five spinners, three of them wrist spinners, with the young legspinner DanishKanaria apparently in the frame to oust Mushtaq Ahmed, however unlikely that may sound. </p> <p>\u0095 The International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit is to investigate allegations about 15 foreign players made in the Indian police's report on match-fixing. But the unit said investigations involving non-Indian players could take \"a number of weeks to complete\". </p> <p>New Zealand's authorities have appointed a three-man team to look into allegations that their former captain Martin Crowe took money from an Indian bookmaker.</p>",

According to Sajjad Asghar, who was standing at Caddick's end while he was bowling to the left-handed batsman Akhtar Sarfraz, the fast bowler \"insulted my country\" after the umpire had refused an appeal for a catch behind the wicket. Although there has been a match referee appointed for the game, he has no jurisdiction other than to report such incidents to the Pakistan cricket board once an official complaint had been made in writing. After play had finished for the day, however, Farrukh Zaman, a former Test player himself, confirmed he had received no such complaint and so the chances are that the incident will go no further. If so, England can breathe a sigh of relief. They will have escaped lightly. During the morning session, a hot-air balloon had been inflated on an adjacent sports field and disappeared to the north towards the mountains. On the cricket field, however, the balloon did not go up until late into the final session as the evening haze descended and the light closed in. A fine partnership between Sarfraz and the bulky right-hander Naumanullah Khan had rescued the Governor's side from 13 for three and was already worth 86 when Sarfraz, missed at slip by Graham Thorpe off Darren Gough's bowling when 16 and now 46, appeared to offer a straightforward edge to Alec Stewart. Certainly there was a loud noise. Caddick's celebrations were curtailed, however, by the umpire's lack of interest. Almost immediately the bowler commenced a stream of rhetoric that was to last several overs, directed for the most part at the batsman but, it is now apparent, at the umpire as well. Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, dismissed this as acceptable sledging (if there is such a thing) and a sign that his side showed \"passion\". According to Asghar, a 46-year-old retired banker who speaks excellent English, it was rather more than this. \"He said something bad about my country,\" he said. \"I can't tolerate that. He can abuse me and he can abuse my decisions but he shouldn't say things about my country. He is a guest here. I don't want to report what he said because it would cause problems for him in other parts of the country.\" There speaks a sensible man and would that Shakoor Rana could have employed the same commonsense approach 13 years ago. Now it is to be hoped that Caddick, trivial though he may think all this is, understands a little more the sensitivity that prevails in this part of the world and plays his part by swallowing his pride and apologising to Asghar for any offence caused. The bowler was trying his socks off but he went too far. The team know now that without compromising their competitive edge, they must tread carefully from hereon in. There is, for example, still an undercurrent of dissatisfaction here that the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Lord MacLaurin, will not be attending an England tour for the first time since he took up his appointment three years ago. The fact that it has been decided instead to send the board's deputy chairman, David Morgan, a good man and a top administrator, to the last Test in Karachi will do little to camouflage the perception that the head honcho is ducking out. There may be some apologising needed on that front too. At least the fracas on the field provided a diversion from what was, apart from a fierce and vastly improved new-ball burst from Gough and Caddick, a day of drudgery and substandard England performance. From 241 for five overnight, Graham Thorpe (48) and Craig White (22) started brightly enough but the innings stagnated after both were out, White to a brilliant catch on the long leg boundary as he hooked. Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury ground out an excruciating and meaningless partnership of just eight that took 55 balls, and when the last wicket fell shortly before lunch just 75 further runs had accrued in 2 hours giving a lead of 91. While the England opening pair bowled with such verve at the start, a win inside three days looked a possibility. Once the ball lost its newness, however, Sarfraz (53 not out) and Naumanullah, who was caught at short midwicket from bat and pad for 50 shortly before bad light stopped play with 13 overs left, played extremely well, making the spinners Giles and Salisbury look worryingly ordinary. Pakistan's selectors meanwhile have named a preliminary squad of 18 players, captained by Moin Khan, for next week's first Test in Lahore. It includes no fewer than five spinners, three of them wrist spinners, with the young legspinner DanishKanaria apparently in the frame to oust Mushtaq Ahmed, however unlikely that may sound. \u0095 The International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit is to investigate allegations about 15 foreign players made in the Indian police's report on match-fixing. But the unit said investigations involving non-Indian players could take \"a number of weeks to complete\". New Zealand's authorities have appointed a three-man team to look into allegations that their former captain Martin Crowe took money from an Indian bookmaker.",

      "trailText": "<p>England's problems lay less with an excess of gambling than a lack of technique. With overhit passes and poor control the norm,  does Sven-Goran Eriksson really know what he will be taking on?</p>",
      "byline": "David Lacey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It might sell fewer newspapers but a more pertinent debate about the England football team would be concerned with how they pass the ball, not how they pass their time. </p> <p>Earlier this week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, cut through all the froth and fuss about card schools and heavy betting when he remarked that England's problem lay less with an excess of gambling than a lack of technique. </p> <p>Quite so. If Peter Taylor's caretakership achieves nothing else in Wednesday's friendly against Italy in Turin his Pan's People of a team can at least show that the acceptable standards of passing and movement which he brought to the England Under-21 side during his three years in charge can be restored at senior level. </p> <p>Before, during and after this summer's European Championship Kevin Keegan complained consistently about the regularity with which his England team gave the ball to their opponents. At Liverpool Keegan was brought up to treat the ball as a prized possession not yielded lightly. </p> <p>With the recent influx of foreign players and coaches the passing in the Premiership is better than it was. But it will have to improve further still to reach the levels of other European leagues. </p> <p>Does Sven-Goran Eriksson really know what he will be taking on when he takes over the England team next July? On television the English game comes over as quick, competitive and exciting with plenty of goalmouth incidents. That is why it is such a TV attraction overseas. </p> <p>Seen live, however, the flaws are more apparent. Eriksson has spent much of his coaching career in Serie A, where it is taken for granted that the last thing a player receiving the ball will worry about is his ability to control it. Even as the ball is in flight he will be weighing up his options for a pass, run or shot and such is the positional discipline of the Italian game that he will know instinctively the movements of those around him. </p> <p>Watch Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Leeds or Chelsea on their good days and one can see similar things happening. The same applies to other teams with good footballing habits - Ipswich, Charlton and West Ham for example. </p> <p>All too often, however, and as much through carelessness and laziness as poor technique, the passing is sloppy. The ball is put into places where a team-mate might be, not where he actually is. Overhit passes, demanding from the recipient the speed of an Olympic sprint champion, are the norm rather than the exception. </p> <p>In Italy or Spain a poor pass will be shrilly derided by the crowd. In England it is either ignored or even applauded, if only for the effort taken to kick the ball a long way. English spectators have been brought up to expect less. An Italian crowd is as likely to cheer an overhit pass as it would relish a tin of chopped spaghetti in tomato sauce. </p> <p>One of the reasons that passing in England is still not as good as it should be is that when teams are giving the ball to each other the importance of possession is reduced. This is why the opponents of Manchester United or Arsenal look so lost when they cannot get the ball back and play so nervously when they have got it. </p> <p>In Wednesday's Champions League game against Dynamo Kiev, Manchester United's performance fell away dramatically after half-time because the Ukrainians' passing began to dominate the play, which is a rare experience for United in the Premiership. </p> <p>There is no reason why the overall quality of passing in the Premiership should not be better. The Scots may have pioneered the passing game but English teams of the past have set new standards in the use and delivery of the ball. </p> <p>In the early 50s the push-and-run style which Arthur Rowe introduced at Tottenham brought the championship to White Hart Lane with distinction and in 1968 Manchester City, the last all-English side to win the title, passed the ball as sweetly as any team before or since. </p> <p>No England team has matched the standards of passing set by Sir Alf Ramsey's side of 1969 and 1970 or the one Ron Greenwood built 10 years later. English footballers, caught young and properly coached, are capable of using the ball as well as anyone. </p> <p> On Wednesday at Old Trafford, for example, Teddy Sheringham's pass out of defence to Andy Cole, which instigated the move from which Sheringham himself scored United's winning goal, was made under pressure and when he was off balance. Yet it was a ball worthy of Michel Platini. </p> <p>The last time England played a game in Italy, the scoreless draw in Rome three years ago which ensured that Glenn Hoddle's side would go straight into the 1998 World Cup without a play-off, they achieved the result they wanted because the quality of their passing enabled them to retain possession and anaesthetise the match. It was not pretty but in the context of the game it was still pretty good. </p> <p>One needed to remember this last Sunday after watching the bovine efforts of Everton and Aston Villa compared with which, Paul Merson's audacious winning goal apart, even the TV programme that has a group of stooges quizzed and derided by a red-headed Dalek in a trouser suit did not seem so much of a weak link in the week's viewing. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "It might sell fewer newspapers but a more pertinent debate about the England football team would be concerned with how they pass the ball, not how they pass their time. Earlier this week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, cut through all the froth and fuss about card schools and heavy betting when he remarked that England's problem lay less with an excess of gambling than a lack of technique. Quite so. If Peter Taylor's caretakership achieves nothing else in Wednesday's friendly against Italy in Turin his Pan's People of a team can at least show that the acceptable standards of passing and movement which he brought to the England Under-21 side during his three years in charge can be restored at senior level. Before, during and after this summer's European Championship Kevin Keegan complained consistently about the regularity with which his England team gave the ball to their opponents. At Liverpool Keegan was brought up to treat the ball as a prized possession not yielded lightly. With the recent influx of foreign players and coaches the passing in the Premiership is better than it was. But it will have to improve further still to reach the levels of other European leagues. Does Sven-Goran Eriksson really know what he will be taking on when he takes over the England team next July? On television the English game comes over as quick, competitive and exciting with plenty of goalmouth incidents. That is why it is such a TV attraction overseas. Seen live, however, the flaws are more apparent. Eriksson has spent much of his coaching career in Serie A, where it is taken for granted that the last thing a player receiving the ball will worry about is his ability to control it. Even as the ball is in flight he will be weighing up his options for a pass, run or shot and such is the positional discipline of the Italian game that he will know instinctively the movements of those around him. Watch Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Leeds or Chelsea on their good days and one can see similar things happening. The same applies to other teams with good footballing habits - Ipswich, Charlton and West Ham for example. All too often, however, and as much through carelessness and laziness as poor technique, the passing is sloppy. The ball is put into places where a team-mate might be, not where he actually is. Overhit passes, demanding from the recipient the speed of an Olympic sprint champion, are the norm rather than the exception. In Italy or Spain a poor pass will be shrilly derided by the crowd. In England it is either ignored or even applauded, if only for the effort taken to kick the ball a long way. English spectators have been brought up to expect less. An Italian crowd is as likely to cheer an overhit pass as it would relish a tin of chopped spaghetti in tomato sauce. One of the reasons that passing in England is still not as good as it should be is that when teams are giving the ball to each other the importance of possession is reduced. This is why the opponents of Manchester United or Arsenal look so lost when they cannot get the ball back and play so nervously when they have got it. In Wednesday's Champions League game against Dynamo Kiev, Manchester United's performance fell away dramatically after half-time because the Ukrainians' passing began to dominate the play, which is a rare experience for United in the Premiership. There is no reason why the overall quality of passing in the Premiership should not be better. The Scots may have pioneered the passing game but English teams of the past have set new standards in the use and delivery of the ball. In the early 50s the push-and-run style which Arthur Rowe introduced at Tottenham brought the championship to White Hart Lane with distinction and in 1968 Manchester City, the last all-English side to win the title, passed the ball as sweetly as any team before or since. No England team has matched the standards of passing set by Sir Alf Ramsey's side of 1969 and 1970 or the one Ron Greenwood built 10 years later. English footballers, caught young and properly coached, are capable of using the ball as well as anyone. On Wednesday at Old Trafford, for example, Teddy Sheringham's pass out of defence to Andy Cole, which instigated the move from which Sheringham himself scored United's winning goal, was made under pressure and when he was off balance. Yet it was a ball worthy of Michel Platini. The last time England played a game in Italy, the scoreless draw in Rome three years ago which ensured that Glenn Hoddle's side would go straight into the 1998 World Cup without a play-off, they achieved the result they wanted because the quality of their passing enabled them to retain possession and anaesthetise the match. It was not pretty but in the context of the game it was still pretty good. One needed to remember this last Sunday after watching the bovine efforts of Everton and Aston Villa compared with which, Paul Merson's audacious winning goal apart, even the TV programme that has a group of stooges quizzed and derided by a red-headed Dalek in a trouser suit did not seem so much of a weak link in the week's viewing. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As the family, friends and fans of Mark Viduka sat down last Saturday to watch what would become his finest hour and a half, one venue was strangely quiet. Deep in west Melbourne's blue collar suburb of Sunshine, above a disused quarry on an industrial estate littered with the shells of burnt-out trucks and cars, the television was off and the Croatian Sports Club deserted. Five years ago, the Melbourne Knights had the best young striker in the country. Now, they don't even have Sky TV. </p> <p>Down the road in Keilor, Joe and Rose Viduka had a dozen people over to celebrate Rose's birthday. The early kick-off at Elland Road was a bonus, and by 10.30pm they were camped in front of the box. What followed was a present beyond mum's wildest dreams: her son 4, Liverpool 3. </p> <p>The party would have been a good deal bigger had the group of mates who call themselves the Croatian Golf Club not been enjoying a weekend on the Murray River. Of the 70 on board, almost everyone had known Viduka since he was a boy. Several glasses were raised for each of his goals; fittingly, the barman poured them off to bed at four. </p> <p>Viduka's journey from Sunshine to gold dust began when he joined the Knights as a six-year-old. Three years later, he netted 13 goals in one match. A year was spent at the Australian Institute of Sport before he returned to Melbourne, aged 17, and scored a double on his senior debut. </p> <p>In a flash he had twice led the national league in goalscoring, twice been named player of the year, won the Knights a championship, and had Real Madrid, Juventus and Sporting Lisbon beating a path to his door. Eventually, he succumbed to the urgings of the late Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and signed for Dynamo Zagreb. He was 19 when he left home for the home his parents had left as teenagers. </p> <p>Three seasons running, with Viduka up front, they won the league and cup double. He grew up a lot too, living in a country ravaged by the Balkans war - hostilities in which he lost an uncle. </p> <p>The awakenings continue. His arrival at Leeds, as in Glasgow before that, was greeted by doubts that he could reproduce previous feats in loftier surrounds. At Celtic there was the added burden of a protracted transfer dispute with Zagreb which so affected Viduka that, still to play a game in Scotland, he retreated to the comfort of his family. </p> <p>One night back in Melbourne, with all and sundry questioning his commitment 12,000 miles away, Viduka wandered into the Celtic supporters club. He won them over; a season as leading goalscorer and players' player of the year silenced doubters at the coalface. </p> <p>Already in the Premiership he has scored nine times from eight games. It would doubtless be more had he not in sisted that Australia's fateful Olympic campaign should take precedence over club duties. His former teammate and now Knights coach Vlado Vanis says: \"If he has to give his life for his country, he will.\" It is perverse to think that checking such passion could be David O'Leary's greatest challenge. </p> <p>As for the Knights, their focus is on survival. Manchester City's Danny Tiatto and Leeds reserve keeper Danny Milosevic have also passed through their gates, but Viduka has been the cash cow - in all the club has made about \u00a3700,000 out of his three transfers.

      "body": "<p>As the ICE express slid effortlessly out of the station towards the flat lands of Saxony, the bass soloist began singing his big aria from Johann Sebastian Bach's cantata 96. \"Safely by Thy pathway lead me, straight to Heaven's portal speed\". </p> <p>With no hills in the way, the path was straight; there was certainly plenty of speed; safety had to be taken on trust. </p> <p>This was an autumn Saturday of bright sun in the year that has seen the 250th anniversary of Bach's death; the next day would be the 18th Sunday after Trinity, for which cantata 96 was written. And on that Sunday evening it would be performed in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, the church where Bach now lies buried. </p> <p>That every word of the cantata was audible on the CD player is a tribute to the soundproofing of German trains, in which doors glide open to reveal blue carpets, yards of fine wood and quietly contented passengers. This train was named after the painter Lucas Cranach and it paused for a while in his home town of Wittenburg. </p> <p>Half-an-hour later, Lucas Cranach came to an unjuddering halt in Leipzig's hauptbahnhof, the largest terminus in Europe with 27 platforms, one for every year that Bach spent in the city. </p> <p>The traffic-free city centre, famed for its trade fairs since 1497, is contained within the ring road on the line of the old city walls and a stroll from one side to other takes barely 15 minutes. Strolling is mandatory; Leipzigers do not rush, not least because there are so many diversions down the courtyards of the trading houses in which merchants sold their wares. Try Barthels Hof, with its lofty baroque bay windows. Stop for a coffee and gaze about. Then have a look at the only extant Bach portrait in the magnificent old city hall of 1556. </p> <p>And you have to stop for another coffee at the Coffee Baum caf\u00e9 and coffee museum, founded in 1619 and reopened after restoration only a couple of years ago. Downstairs, the floorboards are bare and the wooden tabletops are scrubbed white; the chairs lack luxury and match the hard benches; the walls are a sober cream. The waitresses are kitted out in amber peasant frocks, the coffee is excellent, the atmosphere tranquil. Robert Schumann used to come here with his friends and there is a plaque on the wall to prove it. </p> <p>Music has always thrived in Leipzig: Wagner was born here and is commemorated on a plaque on the walls of a department store; Mendelssohn has a house on Goldschmidtstrasse; the orchestra of the Gewandhaus (a concert hall that looks like a designer version of a nuclear bunker) is the oldest of its kind in Europe. </p> <p>There are literary associations, for Leipzig has always been bookish: in Auerbachs Keller, a restaurant in the Madler passage, murals carry 19th-century versions of scenes from Goethe's Faust and a huge barrel is a replica of the one on which Faust rode from the cellar in 1525. Drink too much of the white wine drawn from it by baggy-shirted waiters and you too will sell your soul to Mephistofeles. </p> <p>But we are here for sober Bach. He has a statue outside the Thomaskirche (the guides say his pockets are turned out because, with 20 children to support, he was always broke) and there is a museum in his honour across the way. It is a little worthy, especially if your German does not extend much beyond einbahnstrasse. The best bit is the listening room, where CDs play snatches of the fourth Brandenburg concerto and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott: the man is in the music, not the display cases. </p> <p>The city's musical instrument museum is more entertaining. Press a button and listen to a tape of the nearby hammerflugel, the world's oldest surviving fortepiano; press other buttons to hear a musical clock, a polyphon (an early jukebox), a Schweizer walzenspieldose (a musical box with bells on). There is an abundance of crumhorns, viols and a glass harmonica (for which Mozart wrote one or two numbers). </p> <p>Back to Bach: it's concert time at the Thomaskirche, de-Baroqued 110 years ago and returned to a neo-Gothic style the composer would never have known. Lofty and long, it remains a shrine where Bach's successors direct its famous boys' choir. But tonight the boys have the night off. </p> <p>The Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, led by Sir John Eliot Gardiner and featuring his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists, has arrived for the 48th concert in a peregrination around Europe (and eventually the US) in which all 198 surviving cantatas will be performed on their appointed days. </p> <p>After 10 months on the road and at least one concert a week, they are used to setting up and tuning up; they take their own chamber organ almost everywhere they go. (Because plans for concerts in Latvia and Estonia have had to be abandoned, the pilgrims play in London tonight and tomorrow.) </p> <p>Bass soloist Gotthold Schwarz sings the aria heard at 110mph the previous day; the evening also includes cantatas 116 and 169 and the church is sold out, every stern post-reformation pew packed; the best seats are, curiously, at right angles to the chancel. </p> <p>Some pilgrimage groupies, veterans of several concerts, have made the trip; one row is full of musical tourists from Manchester; across the way is the director of the Bolton Chamber Choir, which is making its own shorter pilgrimage to Bach's city. </p> <p>The next day Bolton's singers will perform in the Nikolaikirche.

      "bodyText": "As the ICE express slid effortlessly out of the station towards the flat lands of Saxony, the bass soloist began singing his big aria from Johann Sebastian Bach's cantata 96. \"Safely by Thy pathway lead me, straight to Heaven's portal speed\". With no hills in the way, the path was straight; there was certainly plenty of speed; safety had to be taken on trust. This was an autumn Saturday of bright sun in the year that has seen the 250th anniversary of Bach's death; the next day would be the 18th Sunday after Trinity, for which cantata 96 was written. And on that Sunday evening it would be performed in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, the church where Bach now lies buried. That every word of the cantata was audible on the CD player is a tribute to the soundproofing of German trains, in which doors glide open to reveal blue carpets, yards of fine wood and quietly contented passengers. This train was named after the painter Lucas Cranach and it paused for a while in his home town of Wittenburg. Half-an-hour later, Lucas Cranach came to an unjuddering halt in Leipzig's hauptbahnhof, the largest terminus in Europe with 27 platforms, one for every year that Bach spent in the city. The traffic-free city centre, famed for its trade fairs since 1497, is contained within the ring road on the line of the old city walls and a stroll from one side to other takes barely 15 minutes. Strolling is mandatory; Leipzigers do not rush, not least because there are so many diversions down the courtyards of the trading houses in which merchants sold their wares. Try Barthels Hof, with its lofty baroque bay windows. Stop for a coffee and gaze about. Then have a look at the only extant Bach portrait in the magnificent old city hall of 1556. And you have to stop for another coffee at the Coffee Baum caf\u00e9 and coffee museum, founded in 1619 and reopened after restoration only a couple of years ago. Downstairs, the floorboards are bare and the wooden tabletops are scrubbed white; the chairs lack luxury and match the hard benches; the walls are a sober cream. The waitresses are kitted out in amber peasant frocks, the coffee is excellent, the atmosphere tranquil. Robert Schumann used to come here with his friends and there is a plaque on the wall to prove it. Music has always thrived in Leipzig: Wagner was born here and is commemorated on a plaque on the walls of a department store; Mendelssohn has a house on Goldschmidtstrasse; the orchestra of the Gewandhaus (a concert hall that looks like a designer version of a nuclear bunker) is the oldest of its kind in Europe. There are literary associations, for Leipzig has always been bookish: in Auerbachs Keller, a restaurant in the Madler passage, murals carry 19th-century versions of scenes from Goethe's Faust and a huge barrel is a replica of the one on which Faust rode from the cellar in 1525. Drink too much of the white wine drawn from it by baggy-shirted waiters and you too will sell your soul to Mephistofeles. But we are here for sober Bach. He has a statue outside the Thomaskirche (the guides say his pockets are turned out because, with 20 children to support, he was always broke) and there is a museum in his honour across the way. It is a little worthy, especially if your German does not extend much beyond einbahnstrasse. The best bit is the listening room, where CDs play snatches of the fourth Brandenburg concerto and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott: the man is in the music, not the display cases. The city's musical instrument museum is more entertaining. Press a button and listen to a tape of the nearby hammerflugel, the world's oldest surviving fortepiano; press other buttons to hear a musical clock, a polyphon (an early jukebox), a Schweizer walzenspieldose (a musical box with bells on). There is an abundance of crumhorns, viols and a glass harmonica (for which Mozart wrote one or two numbers). Back to Bach: it's concert time at the Thomaskirche, de-Baroqued 110 years ago and returned to a neo-Gothic style the composer would never have known. Lofty and long, it remains a shrine where Bach's successors direct its famous boys' choir. But tonight the boys have the night off. The Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, led by Sir John Eliot Gardiner and featuring his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists, has arrived for the 48th concert in a peregrination around Europe (and eventually the US) in which all 198 surviving cantatas will be performed on their appointed days. After 10 months on the road and at least one concert a week, they are used to setting up and tuning up; they take their own chamber organ almost everywhere they go. (Because plans for concerts in Latvia and Estonia have had to be abandoned, the pilgrims play in London tonight and tomorrow.) Bass soloist Gotthold Schwarz sings the aria heard at 110mph the previous day; the evening also includes cantatas 116 and 169 and the church is sold out, every stern post-reformation pew packed; the best seats are, curiously, at right angles to the chancel. Some pilgrimage groupies, veterans of several concerts, have made the trip; one row is full of musical tourists from Manchester; across the way is the director of the Bolton Chamber Choir, which is making its own shorter pilgrimage to Bach's city. The next day Bolton's singers will perform in the Nikolaikirche. It's less austere than the Thomaskirche, proclaims itself \"open to all\" and has played its part in history. In the years leading to the autumn of 1989, Christians and non-Christians gathered every Monday to talk, debate and protest. The government of the old GDR responded with road blocks and arrests. On October 9 1989, it looked as if a violent showdown was coming when 600 party members entered the church. The event is documented in the chilling museum dedicated to the follies of the Stasi, the hated secret police, and in a leaflet available in many languages at the Nikolaikirche, the pastor explains how the government stooges found themselves listening to the Sermon on the Mount on that revolutionary night. Protest leaders appealed for calm. \"As we - more than 2,000 people - came out of the church, tens of thousands were waiting outside in the square,\" writes the pastor. \"They all had candles in their hands.

A little ell of 18th-century stone cottages fronts the Farne islands a mile offshore, the great sweep of sand curving in front of its windows, the kindly eye of the Farne lighthouse keeping the night watches safe and sound above the unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea. My daughters, forever in miniature, patrol the rocks for sea-urchins, two RAF Hawker Hunters tear between the gulls. </p> <p> Brockburn, Monkshouse, Northumberland: Pat Thompson 01661 860165 </p> <p> 2 <strong> Apennines, Italy</strong> <br> </p> <p> Behind Cortona, a hamlet of agriturismo cottages hangs on the hill edge overlooking the vast, husbanded plain of the Val de Chiana. The flat land, the olive groves, the lake are all exactly \"as they appear\" in the corners of the sacred scenes painted by the local Renaissance master, Luca Signorelli, whose radiant pictures hang in the tiny town gallery, to be called on after coffee in the bustling piazza, or before fat Tuscan sausages and porcini-with-truffles for five quid down a blind alley at Il Grotto. </p> <p>Up at the houses, the stout padrone Mario bawls genially to all Anglophones in GCSE French, and the unyielding Tuscan sun beats on the blue of the swimming pool and its imperturbable wasps. </p> <p>Frances Mayes's little place is a step away, her postcard prose by now a part of one's sensibility . . . </p> <p> Borgo Elena near Cortona: Simply Tuscany, 598-608 Chiswick High St W4 5RT, tel: 020-8995 8277. </p> <p> 3 <strong> Pennsylvania, US</strong><br> </p> <p> When unrespectable Philadelphia wanted to go out on the tiles and gamble and drink and gaze down Jersey Lily's corsage, it built a railroad to the coast and put Atlantic City there. When genteel Philadelphians sought an alcohol-dry resort beside the wet sea they went a little further down the seaboard to the very tip of their state, and erected a wooden fantasy town every bit as fairytale as Hollywood was to build a couple of decades later. </p> <p>Cape May is a kind of living Trumpton, its two-mile promenade lined with pastel-painted, lavishly bargeboarded, stoup-adorned clapboard hotels in cobalt, vermilion, ochre and emerald. </p> <p>Punctuating this sedulous and bewitching anachronism are the reassuringly elderly bits and pieces of 1940s seafront - clock golf, pinball arcades, picture palaces, low bars, gift shops, Redcar transported whole to New Jersey. At the top end of the three-street-deep little watering place there is an ample, amiable, wholly democratic marina with massive boardwalks and trays of fat, cringing oysters at seven bucks the dozen. </p> <p> Kelly's Celtic Inn, 24 Ocean, Cape May, New Jersey 08204, tel: 001 609 898 1999. </p> <p> 4 <strong> Paris, France</strong><br> </p> <p> Stand at the door of the dignified Hotel Delavigne in the sixth arrondissement , the quarter where once upon a time the international language was Latin. Up the road and to the left is the Polydor restaurant where you share a red and white gingham tablecloth with strangers come, like you, to breathe the savoury air sniffed by Verlaine and Val\u00e9ry. Round the corner is the Rue de L'Od\u00e9on where Sylvia Beach first opened Shakespeare and Company and loaned out her stout Tauschnitz volumes to Joyce and Hemingway. Straight down the road is the Boulevard St Germain, then across to the knotted little streets around the unbelievable plenitude of the Rue Buci market with its shapely, towering banks of strawberries and tomatoes. </p> <p>Turn right in Rue Buci and thread your way through to the river, gazing across from the left bank, home of scholarship, the intelligentsia, criticism, the very Left itself, at the settled emblems of power and state, Bourse, Louvre, Hotel de Ville. </p> <p>Stroll down to a rendezvous on the Pont Neuf and step into the Henri IV, jammed, cramped, delightfully worn, and blow a mere fiver on a plate of cheeses, a plate of hams, and - for another, trifling \u00a32.50 a glass of calm, commanding Loire red wine. </p> <p> Hotel Delavigne, rue Casimir-Delavigne, 6ieme Paris, tel: 0033 1432 93150 </p> <p> 5 <strong> Venice, Italy</strong><br> </p> <p> Venice, of course, has no business being placed fifth in such a list. Venice is simply the biggest success story we can find to prove the immortality of great cities, rescued from war, pollution, erosion, bankruptcy and drowning. </p> <p>This, however, is the greatest city-treasure, a city that proves Ruskin's pathetic fallacy to be no fallacy at all, for it has a character of complete and varied integrity, features of unequalled beauty . . . the hell with it. Only Henry James got near the heart of the place in words, but try, instead, the painters: Turner, Monet, Sargeant, Ruskin himself, Whistler, Piper (father and son). Buy, for \u00a350, one of the pretty little oil paintings it is still easy to find at Mazzuchi's by local artists still holding, in their modest way, to the line of that mighty and unkillable tradition. </p> <p>Just a couple of minutes' walk from San Marco, up a very narrow calle is the Hotel San Zulian. They have an exquisite attic room (en-suite, naturally) with a balcony overlooking the roofs of Venice, overlooked by the campanile. Stay right there. </p> <p> Hotel San Zulian, San Marco 35, Venice 30124, tel: 0039 0415 225 872. </p> <p> 6 <strong> Bali, Indonesia</strong> </p> <p> In the kindly old New Yorker cartoon, the man rushes breathlessly into the travel agency, bursting out with \"Is Bali . . . still Bali?\" </p> <p>I went to Bali transfixed, like so many others, by the tales about it of that great anthropologist Clifford Geertz. I went to gaze at its \"high gorgeousness\", to discover the mysterious workings of the irrigation co-operative, to hear, if possible, its \"ground-bass of passionless horror\", to see \"the cataracts of long black hair\" on its unforgettable young women. </p> <p>I missed the horror but not by much: civil war is punctual there. I saw the waterworks, and the girls as well, and I stayed in a rush-and-bamboo cabin on the beach, while the ocean splashed softly outside and Dallas played, in Balinese, at the beach bar. </p> <p> Lauda Air flies London to Bali, via Vienna from \u00a3568 return. Book through Bridge the World, tel: 0870 4447474. </p> <p> 7 <strong> Sefrou, Morocco</strong><br> </p> <p> Sefrou is hardly a holiday spot, though plenty of people go to Casablanca or Marrakesh. It's a gritty, windy little town crouched under the Atlas mountains some 15 miles from Fez. As you drive towards it over satisfyingly dusty and potholed roads, the low, orderly line of its walls and towers and rectilinear houses stands clear, first on the skyline and then close in front of you, as though cast in calcium light. </p> <p>You are going to the souk. But don't go in scruffy four-by-four gear. Wear a shirt and trousers. Drink the tiny cups of fierce coffee and watch the hectic order of the day's exchanges, much of it barter, all of it bargained, and a great deal still conducted outside the heavily-bureaucratised, indisputable formalities we assume to be the one right way to price and pay. </p> <p>This is a lesson in difference, even in danger. Receive it carefully. Smile respectfully. And go back to the dusty Franco-Moroccan hotel with a bathroom down the corridor and giant's footsteps to stand on in the loo. Then downstairs from a shady, bare, yellow bedroom for chicken with dusty dates and honey all wrapped in filo. </p> <p> Hotel Sidi Lakcen El Youssi, Sefrou (00212 55683428). For tailor-made trips to Morocco try CLM Morocco Made to Measure (020-7235 0123). </p> <p> 8 <strong> Melbourne, Australia</strong><br> </p> <p> Melbourne is the reallest city. Everybody loves Sydney just now, and well they might. But Melbourne is high, wide and handsome. It is exhilaratingly egalitarian, vividly polyglot. </p> <p>Inside the lovely light-coloured sandstone opera house, the great Nolan has painted a whole wallful of watercolours of the myriad desert flowers that bloom for a few hours in the bush when the rare rains fall. The builders of the opera house each got opera tickets for life, for Melbourne is a place where chippies go to Cosi. </p> <p>It is also a city where Victorian architecture and Modernism stand in mutual respect; where river and towpath are bright with the colours of a population always on the edge of a holiday even when at work; where the big parks look English at first sight until you see the grey, ghostly trunks of the gum trees. Down the broad boulevards clatter the sturdy old trams, holding together the immense flat geography of the place. </p> <p> Flights to Melbourne start at \u00a3560.10 including all taxes, flying with Gulf Air. Accommodation starts at around \u00a330pp per night. For reservations, call Travelbag on 0870 7377781 (<a href=\"http://www.travelbag.co.uk\">www.travelbag.co.uk</a>) </p> <p> 9 <strong> Friesland, Netherlands</strong><br> </p> <p> Pacing beside the holidaymakers are the books and pictures that took them there in the first place. Up at the further tip of the Netherlands, just before you turn the corner into the Kiel Canal is Friesland where that haunting novel The Riddle of the Sands begins. </p> <p>It is a mighty landscape of parallels and monochrome. Long, flat, grey and restless seas, long grey sandbanks and the huge grey, shadowless sky. The Friesian cows are startlingly colourful in their black and white, the little grey inns with amiably remote grey-faced and grey-clad publicans startlingly cheap. You walk the immense sandbanks carefully, keeping an eye on the tide, looking out at the dark bulk of a few fishing boats, hearing only the grey-white gulls and the one-toned shallow sea, and it will all stalk your imagination long after the ghastly mandolins of Corfu have died away. </p> <p> North Netherlands Board of Tourism, tel: 0031 512585079 </p> <p> 10 <strong> Markwick's, Bristol</strong><br> </p> <p> The end of every good holiday is a vast meal. A great meal out simply is, for that evening, a three-hour holiday. My perfect evening holiday is spent at Markwick's restaurant in Bristol's narrow Corn Street, where the Exchange building was inspired by Sansovino's library in Venice. Down marble steps reposes that perfect combination of the familiar (heavy wooden counters, low dim room, cordial welcome, classic cuisine) and the foreign (shy, authoritative patron, rare dishes, unexpected juxtapositions of taste and colour) which is the matrix of the holiday. </p> <p> Markwick's Restaurant, 43 Corn St, Bristol BS1 1HT, tel: 0117 926 2658. </p> <p> Happiness and fulfilment unfold in one's heart as a match between one's desires and the experience in front of you. It can happen in an evening, a weekend, a fortnight. Even a life. </p> <p>The Delicious History of the Holiday, by Professor Fred Inglis, is published by Routledge at \u00a316.99.</p>",

They treat us terribly badly.\" </p> <p>Pensioner Ted Edwards says he told the council last week that a window frame in his 11th floor flat was falling out. \"They told me they'd be round to fix it, then called back and said all work was being suspended because they'd stopped all spending - something about running out of money.\" </p> <p>This is something of an understatement. The borough, torn apart by poisonous political infighting for much of the past 18 years, official incompetence, a string of highly damaging reports from government inspectorates, allegations of corruption and racism, and mass resignations, appears to be heading in a direction which even eluded Militant-led Liverpool in the mid-80s. It is facing a \u00a340m deficit by the end of March. </p> <p>Welcome to Hackney. Statistically the fourth most deprived borough in England, with unemployment running at 14% - over twice the London average - its 5,000 east end acres retain a cultural richness from 40 languages in a series of communities which belies the underlying poverty of many citizens and the financial chaos in the town hall. </p> <p>The relative harmony between Hasidic Jew, muslim from Turkey and Kurdistan, Cypriot, African-Caribbean, and the white working class - not to mention up to 15,000 asylum seekers - has rarely been replicated in the council chamber. Yet with some services collapsing, such as council tax and rent collection, and thousands of the poorest tenants facing eviction through a failure to pay housing benefit, Labour and Tory councillors finally sank their differences seven months ago to form an unprecedented coalition. </p> <p>But even this was not enough to save Hackney from further ignominy this week when the council faced up to years of mismanagement after a savage report from the audit commission's new local government inspectorate. Outlining the potential deficit of \u00a340m, with severe financial problems not yet under control, it said the authority could not meet its statutory commitments such as education and social services without big spending cuts. \"These problems are so serious that they threaten the council's ability to function satisfactorily,\" it warned. </p> <p>Exactly how Hackney got into such a mess is open to question. Years of political turmoil, which began with a hard left takeover in 1982, took their toll, compounded by a split in the Labour group, a brief Lib Dem administration, and a decision to devolve budgets to individual departments without proper central control. But matters finally came to a head with the preparation of this year's budget which, in the words of the local government inspectorate, contained \"two especially grave risks\". </p> <p>Council officials assumed they could collect 96% of council tax, when their previous best performance was only 75%. They also budgeted for substantial cost cutting in street cleaning and refuse collection when they had no plan to deliver the economies. Result? Financial meltdown, with that most visible, third world symbol of a municipality in crisis: piles of uncollected rubbish on the streets. </p> <p>The crisis only slowly came to light when another town hall spending watchdog, the district auditor, warned the council's new managing director, Max Caller, of his grave concern in a letter on October 10. Seven days later, the authority responded with an order to staff freezing all spending. It even told senior officers to hand over 300 mobile phones to save \u00a3120,000. This week the Labour-Tory administration shaved over \u00a322m from the budget this year and next to meet some of the deficit. Up to 500 jobs could go from the 9,000 workforce - 250 fairly quickly - while an outside contractor will take over the collapsing street cleaning and refuse collection service next month. </p> <p>Mr Caller, who joined the council four months ago on \u00a3150,000 a year after a long period as chief executive of Barnet, north London, believes the deficit will be much less than \u00a340m. Hackney's salvation rests on the government permitting the borrowing of extra cash to keep it afloat while other efficiency measures are introduced. Other authorities have also launched an unprecedented rescue operation, led by the chief executive of Nottingham, with key officials seconded from other town halls. </p> <p>Outwardly Mr Caller exudes calm. \"There will be no subsidy from the government,\" he insists. \"Hackney has to put its own house in order and pay its way in the world.\" Unfortunately, many of its poorest citizens are unable to pay their way thanks to incompetence before Mr Caller arrived. At present 17,000 housing benefit claims are awaiting assessment by a private contractor who was handed the council's revenue service two years ago. </p> <p>Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people have been served with eviction notices by landlords, including the council's own housing department, because they are in arrears, and unable to pay the full rent because the benefit has not arrived. </p> <p>The full impact of the chaos can be found across the road from Hackney town hall in the citizens' advice bureau. Manager Osi Okponobi says they process more than 200 housing benefit complaints each month; council inefficiency is so deep he has resorted to faxing the town hall outstanding cases which they should have recorded. \"This far outweighs any other problem we have to tackle,\" he laments. \"People are under such mental stress.\" </p> <p>The turmoil led to street protests this week when Hackney Tenants' Convention, representing 29,000 council tenants, lobbied the council meeting surrounded by riot police. For good measure, those elusive refuse trucks and street sweeping vehicles inexplicably joined the protest, bringing the streets to a standstill. </p> <p>Linda Hibberd, who chairs the convention, cannot contain her anger: her 75-year-old mother Matilda Owen (a former Labour councillor for 26 years) has been served with an arrears notice. \"She hasn't received her benefit and can't pay the full amount and it made her shake with worry. A lot of older people are distraught.\" </p> <p>Yet Jules Pipe and Eric Ollerenshaw, Labour and Tory leaders respectively, insist they are confident that Hackney has turned the corner. \"The real message Eric and I want to drive home is that while we disagree politically, there are things that need sorting out - getting street cleaning, and refuse collection right, for instance - that need not be a political football.\" </p> <p>Time is not on their side. Unless the council's recovery programme satisfies the local government inspectorate, the axe will finally fall on the borough next year.

      "body": "<p>Over the last decade, snowboarding has transformed from the blight of the slopes to a respected and ever more popular alternative to skiing. Everyone - from skate kids and octogenarians to our very own future monarchs - seems to be going board mad. </p> <p>But the snowboarders' domain is different to that of their pole bearing counterparts. They scour the slopes for funparks, halfpipes and elusive fresh powder, for which a board is the ideal vehicle. </p> <p>Happy riding. </p> <p> <strong> Mayrhofen</strong> is the principal resort of the Ziller Valley, in the Austrian Tyrol, and is home to many of the country's top snowboarders. It is easily accessible from Innsbruck airport as well as from Munich, to where cheap flights from the UK are readily available. </p> <p>Although the area is rather low (below 2,500m) and the snowfall unreliable, the vastness of the terrain will keep even the most adventurous of riders happy. A Zillertal superskipass entitles use of 145 lifts covering an area of 462km, so there's plenty of secret powder stashes to be found. Even if good snow is not forthcoming, you can always head to the Hintertux Glacier and play on the multitude of both natural and man-made jumps and drops. </p> <p>There's a funpark and halfpipe on the Horberg, while those seeking a little privacy should investigate the backcountry accessible from the top of the Penkenjoch or down the valley at Zell. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> Scotties Pub, Arena Nightclub<br> </p> <p> <strong> More information: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.mayrhofen.com\">www.mayrhofen.com </a></p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Host of next April's British Snowboarding Championships to which Thomson (0870 6061470) is offering special all-inclusive snowboard packages and has snowboard academies.

Off the mountain, Axamer is hardly the most attractive of resorts, consisting of four hotels and a carpark. But the actual ski area is a gem as far as snowboarders are concerned. Close to Innsbruck, it is easily accessible although lift queues can be long at weekends. </p> <p>The resort's 10 lifts service the two peaks of Hoadl and Pleisen, which have hosted the winter Olympics twice, so the pistes are challenging to say the least. There is a pipe and park in the resort although they are not well maintained. The rider should not find this a problem, though, as the natural terrain is littered with obstacles and good freeriding. When ascending the mountain in the main gondola, advanced riders should check out possible tree runs to the left and right of the lift line; they won't be disappointed. Alternatively, powder hounds can search out trails 3, 4 and 10 to the right of the top chair. Remember, when riding the backcountry, be conscious of the environment and don't not destroy freshly-planted saplings. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> (in Innsbruck) Jimmy's, the Couch Bar<br></p> <p><strong> More information: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.axams.at/\">www.axams.at</a> or <a href=\"http://www.austria-tourism.at\">www.austria-tourism.at</a><br></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Hourmont Ski Direct (01273 220777) is offering seven days, six nights' full board for \u00a3349 travelling by Snowcoach. For flights, add \u00a380-\u00a3120. <br></p> <p> <strong> Red Mountain</strong> is neither the most popular nor the most accessible of resorts in Canada, but it is a snowboarding experience that cannot be missed. If you brave the small prop plane that flies between Vancouver and Castlegar, or take the seven-hour coach transfer, you will be greeted by a snow-bound experience from a bygone age. There are no crowds, no high-speed quads and no rambling resort complexes at the base of the mountain. But there is plenty of snow and it's mostly untracked. </p> <p>The resort consists of two mountains: Grante -which is the larger - and Red. Together, they cover an area of 1,100 acres. The face of Red Mountain is extremely steep and fast but there are plenty of tree runs off-piste. Additionally, if accompanied by a guide, you can ride some of Canada's most incredible backcountry bowls here. But be warned: the danger levels are high. Grante has the lion's share of groomed runs and a plethora of natural jumps and tree runs. Try to hook up with some locals though as the majority of Red Mountain's delights lie beyond the resort boundaries. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> The Powder Keg, Rafters. <br></p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Frontier Ski (020-8776 8709) offers seven nights' B&amp;B in the Ram's Head Inn starting at \u00a3799, based on two people sharing.

It is a 45-minute drive from Geneva airport to which many low-cost airlines now fly. </p> <p>Even from the town, the mountains are impressive in their size and severity and, after hearing countless tales of crevasses and hidden cliff drops, you will hesitate before venturing on to the lift system. But fear not, Chamonix has something for everyone in its 11 rideable areas (it has the largest linked terrain in the world). From the mellower inclines of Le Tour with its natural jumps, to the rolling playgrounds of Brevent, both freeriders and freestylers will find enough to keep them happy for at least a season. And for those who want to take their riding to new extremes, there's always Argenti\u00e8re. Be warned though: Chamonix's backcountry is extensive and dangerous, so always enlist the help of guides and be prepared for any eventuality. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> La Cantina, The Pub, Le Terras. <br></p> <p><strong> More information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.chamonix.net\"> www.chamonix.net </a> <br></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">EasyJet</a> flies to Geneva.

It is also easily accessible for the traveller, the best point of entry being Turin, which is an hour's drive away. </p> <p>The snowboarding facilities are comprehensive and include two pipes, two parks and one of Europe's best boarder-X tracks. With so much to play on, it has become a regular hangout for many of the Continent's best riders. The main pipe and park are located below the Platti\u00e8res 2, while the second is tucked away near the Tougnette mid-station. Another funpark has recently been built at Biolley. </p> <p>For the most challenging and beautiful off-piste riding, head for Mont du Vallon. To the east of the town are the Col de la Loze and Saulire, beyond which lie the Bozel Valley and Courchevel; to the west, one can ride a long ridge with access to the areas of Belleville Valley and the resorts of Val Thorens, Les Menuires and St-Martin-de-Belleville. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> Capricorn Bar. </p> <p><strong> More information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.meribel.net\">www.meribel.net</a><br></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> This winter, Club Med (0700 2582633) opens two new chalet-style villages.

In the past, the maintenance of snowboard-specific facilities has been limited to contest dates, although in recent years this has changed. There are now two well-cut pipes and a park on the Parsenn slope, one of which is within hiking distance of the premier snowboarders' bar and hotel, the Bolgenschanze. </p> <p>Probably the greatest disadvantage about this mountain is actually getting up to the higher slopes due to a rather slow funicular from Davos Platz and Dorf, but the riding is well worth the hassle. </p> <p>From the top station, the freeriding opportunities are endless although if heading out of bounds, it is advisable to take a guide. There are some amazing tree runs to be found off to the left of the cat track that leads down to the mid-station while another free-riders' paradise is on the run from the top of the Jakobshorn to Teufi. Don't be afraid to investigate the entire catchment area of Davos as there is a free bus service included in your lift pass. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> Bolgenschanze Hotel </p> <p><strong> More information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.davos.ch\">www.davos.ch</a><br> </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Inghams (0208-780 4433) is offering a two-for-one lift pass at hotels in Davos for some dates during January.

The resort authorities are therefore committed to keeping the snowboard-specific facilities in top condition. It is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Zurich airport or a 10-hour drive from Calais. </p> <p>There are two pipes in Laax, the main one of which is located on the Crap Sogn Gion under the Gondola. The second has been carved into the Vorab glacier and is as good as, if not better than, the main one. Running alongside the pipe on the Vorab glacier is Laax's gargantuan funpark, which will test riders of all standards. </p> <p>But Laax is not only a freestylers' paradise; the backcountry is vast and varied in its delights. Take the draglift to the top of the Vorab and descend to your right. Here you will find limitless fields of powder dissected by natural gullies and chutes. There are also plenty of tree runs below the main gondola that lead down to the resort base. <br></p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> The Crap bar. <br></p> <p><strong> More information: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.laax.ch\">www.laax.ch</a> Switzerland Travel Centre: 00800 10020030 <br></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Momentum Travel (020-7371 9111).Seven nights in Flims, a lovely village that shares the Laax ski area, staying in the Sunstar Hotel starts at \u00a3799pp.<br></p> <p> <strong> Other operators: </strong> Made to Measure 01243 533333, Plus Travel 020-734 0383, Ski Choice 01491 837607, </p> <p> <strong>Mammoth Mountain</strong>, in California, is one of North America's largest ski resorts. The nearest airport is Reno, although, for the sake of seeing some of the US, you could rent a car and drive from either LA or San Francisco. </p> <p>The larger of the two funparks , \"The Unbound\", is accessible from the Thunder Bound Express quad and features a vast array of spines, hips and kickers as well as two half pipes. The area is floodlit most nights until 9pm. The second smaller park and pipe are at the Canyon Lodge. </p> <p>For those who like their terrain a little more natural, there's Dragon's Back and Hemlock Ridge as well as the natural pipe of Upper Dry Creek. </p> <p>If you want to escape the weekend crowds that flock to the resort from LA and San Francisco, head for June Mountain, a 20-minute drive away. There is a fun park and pipe as well as sparsely- populated open runs down the mountain's main face. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs: </strong> Whisky Creek, Chick and Pizza. <br></p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.visitmammoth.com\">www.visitmammoth.com </a><br></p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong> Crystal (0870 84870003) offers seven nights' B&amp;B at Jagerhof Lodge starting at \u00a3559, including flights and transfers.

It is an easy two-hour drive from Toulouse. </p> <p>The snowboard scene in Spain is not huge but its stronghold is located here. This is in part due to the pipe that the resort has built for the past two years, although it is worth taking your own spade to shape the walls, as the maintenance is sporadic to say the least. </p> <p>The resort is made up of four separate mountains that are all well linked by 37 modern lifts. Bonaigua provides the best terrain for freeriding although come spring it is also the worst affected by the sun. After a fresh fall of snow, head for an area called Argulls located between Bonaigua and Baqueira as there are plenty of powder stashes to ride here. For those who like their riding steep, there are also plenty of options in the northern parts of the resort, including the aptly-named couloir of \"Where Goats Tumble\". </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs:</strong> Jai Aran, Era Crin. <br></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Ski Miquel (01457 821200) offers seven nights in the Chalet Hotel Salana starting at \u00a3319 and including breakfast, tea, three- course dinner, wine, flights and transfers. <br></p> <p> <strong> Madonna di Campiglio</strong> is neither Italy's most glamorous nor its largest resort, but it is the heartland of the country's snowboarding scene. This is due to the commitment shown to the sport by the resort authorities and because it has hosted many international snowboarding events in the past. It is located in the narrow valley of Brenta Dolomites, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Verona. </p> <p>The resort consists of three separate areas, which are linked at the base by a web of ridable paths. The majority of the resort runs are suited to the intermediate snowboarder, although if you are looking for a little more adventure you should buy a \"superskirama\" lift pass and access the resorts of Folgarida and Marivella. There is a snowboard park, boarder-X track and well-maintained pipe in the Goste area, which is about the only part of the resort that is above the treeline. The only disadvantage about this area is that it is not fenced off to stray mountain users, so be observant. </p> <p>There are plenty of natural obstacles to be found on the mountains, while freeriders should check out the Spinale and Fortini to take advantage of some awesome terrain. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and clubs: </strong> Disco Zangola, The Cliffhanger <br></p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.campiglio.net\">www.campiglio.net </a><br></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Interhome (020-8891 1294) offers a week's ski-drive holiday in a two-room apartment for two-five people sharing from \u00a3636, including ferry crossings. <br></p> <p><strong> Other operators:</strong> Inghams 020-8780 4433, Crystal 0870 8487000, Thomson 0870 6061470. <br></p> <p> \u0095 Danny Burrows is the English editor of Onboard magazine, the next issue of which is out on January 1. <a href=\"http://www.onboardmag.com\">www.onboardmag.com </a><br></p> <p> Books: The Snowboard Guide: North America and The Snowboard Guide : Europe are published by Low Pressure (020-7792 3134) at \u00a319.95.

The resort authorities are therefore committed to keeping the snowboard-specific facilities in top condition. It is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Zurich airport or a 10-hour drive from Calais. There are two pipes in Laax, the main one of which is located on the Crap Sogn Gion under the Gondola. The second has been carved into the Vorab glacier and is as good as, if not better than, the main one. Running alongside the pipe on the Vorab glacier is Laax's gargantuan funpark, which will test riders of all standards. But Laax is not only a freestylers' paradise; the backcountry is vast and varied in its delights. Take the draglift to the top of the Vorab and descend to your right. Here you will find limitless fields of powder dissected by natural gullies and chutes. There are also plenty of tree runs below the main gondola that lead down to the resort base. Bars and clubs: The Crap bar. More information: www.laax.ch Switzerland Travel Centre: 00800 10020030 Getting there: Momentum Travel (020-7371 9111).Seven nights in Flims, a lovely village that shares the Laax ski area, staying in the Sunstar Hotel starts at \u00a3799pp. Other operators: Made to Measure 01243 533333, Plus Travel 020-734 0383, Ski Choice 01491 837607, Mammoth Mountain, in California, is one of North America's largest ski resorts. The nearest airport is Reno, although, for the sake of seeing some of the US, you could rent a car and drive from either LA or San Francisco. The larger of the two funparks , \"The Unbound\", is accessible from the Thunder Bound Express quad and features a vast array of spines, hips and kickers as well as two half pipes. The area is floodlit most nights until 9pm. The second smaller park and pipe are at the Canyon Lodge. For those who like their terrain a little more natural, there's Dragon's Back and Hemlock Ridge as well as the natural pipe of Upper Dry Creek. If you want to escape the weekend crowds that flock to the resort from LA and San Francisco, head for June Mountain, a 20-minute drive away. There is a fun park and pipe as well as sparsely- populated open runs down the mountain's main face. Bars and clubs: Whisky Creek, Chick and Pizza. Further information: www.visitmammoth.com Getting there Crystal (0870 84870003) offers seven nights' B&amp;B at Jagerhof Lodge starting at \u00a3559, including flights and transfers.

It is an easy two-hour drive from Toulouse. The snowboard scene in Spain is not huge but its stronghold is located here. This is in part due to the pipe that the resort has built for the past two years, although it is worth taking your own spade to shape the walls, as the maintenance is sporadic to say the least. The resort is made up of four separate mountains that are all well linked by 37 modern lifts. Bonaigua provides the best terrain for freeriding although come spring it is also the worst affected by the sun. After a fresh fall of snow, head for an area called Argulls located between Bonaigua and Baqueira as there are plenty of powder stashes to ride here. For those who like their riding steep, there are also plenty of options in the northern parts of the resort, including the aptly-named couloir of \"Where Goats Tumble\". Bars and clubs: Jai Aran, Era Crin. Getting there: Ski Miquel (01457 821200) offers seven nights in the Chalet Hotel Salana starting at \u00a3319 and including breakfast, tea, three- course dinner, wine, flights and transfers. Madonna di Campiglio is neither Italy's most glamorous nor its largest resort, but it is the heartland of the country's snowboarding scene. This is due to the commitment shown to the sport by the resort authorities and because it has hosted many international snowboarding events in the past. It is located in the narrow valley of Brenta Dolomites, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Verona. The resort consists of three separate areas, which are linked at the base by a web of ridable paths. The majority of the resort runs are suited to the intermediate snowboarder, although if you are looking for a little more adventure you should buy a \"superskirama\" lift pass and access the resorts of Folgarida and Marivella. There is a snowboard park, boarder-X track and well-maintained pipe in the Goste area, which is about the only part of the resort that is above the treeline. The only disadvantage about this area is that it is not fenced off to stray mountain users, so be observant. There are plenty of natural obstacles to be found on the mountains, while freeriders should check out the Spinale and Fortini to take advantage of some awesome terrain. Bars and clubs: Disco Zangola, The Cliffhanger Further information: www.campiglio.net Getting there: Interhome (020-8891 1294) offers a week's ski-drive holiday in a two-room apartment for two-five people sharing from \u00a3636, including ferry crossings.

      "body": "<p>Mongolians are not very good at towns and Hovd was no exception. The capital of a province the size of Scotland, it felt like an abandoned outpost at world's end. Dead things littered what passed for streets - the hooves of deceased horses, the bones of butchered sheep, the carcasses of jeeps. </p> <p>In fairness, Hovd was not a bad effort for people who hate towns. The last domain of the nomads who once terrorised Asia, Mongolia is a pristine landscape traversed by clouds and camels and gangs of unruly sheep. It could be God's preliminary sketch for Earth, not so much a country as the ingredients out of which countries are made: grass, rock, water and wind. In these virginal steppes, where round white tents sprout as suddenly and as mysteriously as mushrooms, towns were a blight. </p> <p>I was crossing the country by horse, a thousand miles from Bayan Olgii to Dadal, the birthplace of Genghis Khan, and I rode into Hovd like a cowpoke looking for supplies and excitement - rice, beer and a night on the tiles. Normally this would have been a tall order for a Mongolian town. But in Hovd I got lucky. I arrived on the eve of the annual Naadam festival, when the town becomes a magnet for the nomads from outlying districts. The Naadam is a celebration of Mongolian culture as expressed in four national sports: horse racing, wrestling, archery and drinking. It was party time in Hovd, and when Mongolians party, says a Chinese proverb, the rest of Asia locks its doors. </p> <p>Mongolia's towns are a recent phenomenon. They are all composed of the same ingredients, as if officials, unfamiliar with towns, were working to a checklist: a barren-looking square, a town hall, a theatre, a museum, a school, a hospital, a sports stadium. In their drabness they are barely distinguishable from one another. Mix in a few potholes and a sprinkling of animal bones, add a lot of waste ground and a handful of Russian-style tenements in an advanced state of dilapidation, and the desolation is complete. </p> <p>The Naadam got off to a gentle start down at the stadium with the wrestling bouts. Between open terraces and two small pavilions the pitch was overgrown with wild flowers. At its centre, where the Red Flag used to fly, was a group of nine poles topped with yaks tails, the standard of Genghis Khan. The tails were white, which was just as well. Black meant war. </p> <p>Crowds milled about in their best silk and velvet dels, the traditional sashed robes of Mongolia. Everyone was in a good mood and a hat. Men and women alike were partial to handsome fedoras and trilbies. A few of the more august figures wore bowlers. </p> <p>Naadam was a great occasion for medals. To keep the long-suffering herdsmen sweet, the former communist government had doled out gongs with abandon. The result was medal inflation. Medals that were once great honours quickly became worthless and new ones had constantly to be minted. There was the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Sukhbatur, the Order of the Pole Star, and the Best Worker in the Fifth Five Year Plan Medal. Men got medals for acts of courage like party membership and high livestock yields. Women got them for bearing children. One old woman proudly showed me \"The Order of Glorious Motherhood, First Grade\", a Victoria Cross of motherhood. Pinned to her formidable bosom, it celebrated the fact that she had had more than 10 children. </p> <p>The loudspeakers were droning with speeches by local dignitaries. No one seemed to listen, not even the band who struck up a catchy dance tune in the middle of the governor's peroration on civic duty. Eventually he gave up, and retreated to the reviewing stand. Most Mongolian politicians are ex-communists forging new careers, somewhat shakily, as democrats. They are struggling to get used that most fundamental ingredient of democracy: the right to ignore politicians. Beneath their bowler hats, they sat darkly in a row muttering about the good old days. </p> <p>A frisson went through the crowd as the wrestlers were introduced according to their status: Falcon, Elephant, Lion, and Giant, last year's champion. Most of the participants were of the Sumo tendency - huge fellows who looked like they got through half a yak at breakfast. Among the big stomachs were a scattering of slim men looking understandably nervous. </p> <p>The wrestlers' costumes appeared to have been designed for a dance troupe: boots with elfin toes, pointed hats, short sparkly jackets, and pretty embroidered Y-fronts. One by one, the big men trotted out into mid-field where they performed the Eagle Dance, flapping their arms in slow motion and bowing before the standard of Genghis Khan. </p> <p>I asked an old fellow next to me the reason for the curious design of the jackets - long sleeves but an open front that left the chest bare. </p> <p>\"Keeps the women out,\" he muttered. In Outer Mongolia women wrestlers are much feared. The annals of Mongolian wrestling are full of stories in which devious viragos disguised their sex, entered the wrestling competition and destroyed all the best heavyweights. Marco Polo related a tale of a Mongolian woman who decided she could only marry a man who could throw her. Despite a succession of muscle-bound suitors, she remained a spinster. The idea of the open-fronted jacket is that it allows the more alert judges to spot a woman straight away and hustle her out of the competition before she causes any damage. </p> <p>As the wrestling got underway, it was quickly evident that the slim fellows were cannon-fodder for the guys with the big bellies. The early bouts were full of action as large men threw small men with satisfying thumps. As the small men were gradually weeded out, the competition became stiffer and the contests duller. Locked together like stalled bulldozers, the big men could go 15 rounds without moving. The only action came between rounds when the seconds straightened the wrestlers' Y-fronts and patted their bottoms. </p> <p>The horse races were better value, and the following morning I set off in a jeep, bouncing across the empty steppe to where a large crowd had assembled at a finish line in the middle of nowhere. Naadam races are run cross-country over marathon distances, 20 miles in the case of the Hovd races. People milled about in their hats, greeting one another with elaborate salutations. Many of the men had arrived in the same straw fedora whose hat bands bore the bewitching legend: Strength Through Milk. </p> <p>While we waited for the runners and riders to arrive, drinking parties were springing up on all sides. Mongols unpacked elaborate picnics of petrified cheese, dumplings and bottles of vodka with the brand-name of Genghis Khan. In no time, everyone was roaring drunk. I fell in with Ganbold, the local history teacher. Twenty years of teaching 14-year-olds about the glories of the communist revolution had honed his conversation to laborious banalities. Ganbold was a connoisseur of the obvious, never happier than when explaining something you already knew. </p> <p>The approach of the field was announced by a distant cloud of dust. </p> <p>\"The horses are coming,\" Ganbold explained helpfully. </p> <p>The vodka-sodden crowds pushed forward towards the finish line where three inebriated policemen threw stones at them to try to hold them back. As the horses began to emerge from the dust, a steward ran forward waving an enormous red flag to guide the riders to the unmarked finish line. A crescendo of whoops and whistles rose from the crowd. Young men hollered, women shrieked, old men stamped their feet, and babies, waving fat arms, burst into tears. </p> <p>The jockeys were children, both boys and girls, few of them older than eight, who had completed the course bareback and barefoot. In their paper race hats they looked as if they were returning from a rather jolly children's party, dazed with too much cake. As the first finishers crossed the line, the crowds broke ranks, overrunning the policemen and engulfing the lathered horses. Fathers caught hold of the bridles, sisters started frantically wiping the sweat from the flanks with special paddles, and mothers lifted their child jockeys down from the horses to revive them with fermented mare's milk. </p> <p>One horse collapsed a few yards from the finishing line. Its rider, a young girl of about seven, picked herself up and began to kick the horse in the chest, apparently the Mongolian equivalent of an equine kiss of life, meant to revive the poor creature. The owner had a more traditional remedy. He ran out from the crowd, produced a bottle of Genghis Khan from the folds of his del and poured the contents down the horse's throat. The effect was immediate. The animal leapt to its feet and hared off back towards Hovd, rider-less, without bothering to cross the finishing line. A steward's inquiry presumably disqualified the beast: \"retired, drunk\". </p> <p>Back at the stadium in the afternoon, the wrestling final was underway, when a great party of dishevelled horsemen arrived - the Naadam winners, their owners, their trainers, and their pals. To the roar of the crowd, they cantered round the arena beneath the terraces in a couple of laps of honour burying the wrestlers in veils of dust. </p> <p>For the presentation, the riders gathered beneath the equivalent of the royal box where the politicians were seated. Professional praise singers sang the praises of the horses, the races and riders in thrilling nasal arias. The governor, pleased at last to be the centre of attention, handed out the prizes - Chinese carpets and bricks of Russian tea - as if he had bought them himself.

      "bodyText": "Mongolians are not very good at towns and Hovd was no exception. The capital of a province the size of Scotland, it felt like an abandoned outpost at world's end. Dead things littered what passed for streets - the hooves of deceased horses, the bones of butchered sheep, the carcasses of jeeps. In fairness, Hovd was not a bad effort for people who hate towns. The last domain of the nomads who once terrorised Asia, Mongolia is a pristine landscape traversed by clouds and camels and gangs of unruly sheep. It could be God's preliminary sketch for Earth, not so much a country as the ingredients out of which countries are made: grass, rock, water and wind. In these virginal steppes, where round white tents sprout as suddenly and as mysteriously as mushrooms, towns were a blight. I was crossing the country by horse, a thousand miles from Bayan Olgii to Dadal, the birthplace of Genghis Khan, and I rode into Hovd like a cowpoke looking for supplies and excitement - rice, beer and a night on the tiles. Normally this would have been a tall order for a Mongolian town. But in Hovd I got lucky. I arrived on the eve of the annual Naadam festival, when the town becomes a magnet for the nomads from outlying districts. The Naadam is a celebration of Mongolian culture as expressed in four national sports: horse racing, wrestling, archery and drinking. It was party time in Hovd, and when Mongolians party, says a Chinese proverb, the rest of Asia locks its doors. Mongolia's towns are a recent phenomenon. They are all composed of the same ingredients, as if officials, unfamiliar with towns, were working to a checklist: a barren-looking square, a town hall, a theatre, a museum, a school, a hospital, a sports stadium. In their drabness they are barely distinguishable from one another. Mix in a few potholes and a sprinkling of animal bones, add a lot of waste ground and a handful of Russian-style tenements in an advanced state of dilapidation, and the desolation is complete. The Naadam got off to a gentle start down at the stadium with the wrestling bouts. Between open terraces and two small pavilions the pitch was overgrown with wild flowers. At its centre, where the Red Flag used to fly, was a group of nine poles topped with yaks tails, the standard of Genghis Khan. The tails were white, which was just as well. Black meant war. Crowds milled about in their best silk and velvet dels, the traditional sashed robes of Mongolia. Everyone was in a good mood and a hat. Men and women alike were partial to handsome fedoras and trilbies. A few of the more august figures wore bowlers. Naadam was a great occasion for medals. To keep the long-suffering herdsmen sweet, the former communist government had doled out gongs with abandon. The result was medal inflation. Medals that were once great honours quickly became worthless and new ones had constantly to be minted. There was the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Sukhbatur, the Order of the Pole Star, and the Best Worker in the Fifth Five Year Plan Medal. Men got medals for acts of courage like party membership and high livestock yields. Women got them for bearing children. One old woman proudly showed me \"The Order of Glorious Motherhood, First Grade\", a Victoria Cross of motherhood. Pinned to her formidable bosom, it celebrated the fact that she had had more than 10 children. The loudspeakers were droning with speeches by local dignitaries. No one seemed to listen, not even the band who struck up a catchy dance tune in the middle of the governor's peroration on civic duty. Eventually he gave up, and retreated to the reviewing stand. Most Mongolian politicians are ex-communists forging new careers, somewhat shakily, as democrats. They are struggling to get used that most fundamental ingredient of democracy: the right to ignore politicians. Beneath their bowler hats, they sat darkly in a row muttering about the good old days. A frisson went through the crowd as the wrestlers were introduced according to their status: Falcon, Elephant, Lion, and Giant, last year's champion. Most of the participants were of the Sumo tendency - huge fellows who looked like they got through half a yak at breakfast. Among the big stomachs were a scattering of slim men looking understandably nervous. The wrestlers' costumes appeared to have been designed for a dance troupe: boots with elfin toes, pointed hats, short sparkly jackets, and pretty embroidered Y-fronts. One by one, the big men trotted out into mid-field where they performed the Eagle Dance, flapping their arms in slow motion and bowing before the standard of Genghis Khan. I asked an old fellow next to me the reason for the curious design of the jackets - long sleeves but an open front that left the chest bare. \"Keeps the women out,\" he muttered. In Outer Mongolia women wrestlers are much feared. The annals of Mongolian wrestling are full of stories in which devious viragos disguised their sex, entered the wrestling competition and destroyed all the best heavyweights. Marco Polo related a tale of a Mongolian woman who decided she could only marry a man who could throw her. Despite a succession of muscle-bound suitors, she remained a spinster. The idea of the open-fronted jacket is that it allows the more alert judges to spot a woman straight away and hustle her out of the competition before she causes any damage. As the wrestling got underway, it was quickly evident that the slim fellows were cannon-fodder for the guys with the big bellies. The early bouts were full of action as large men threw small men with satisfying thumps. As the small men were gradually weeded out, the competition became stiffer and the contests duller. Locked together like stalled bulldozers, the big men could go 15 rounds without moving. The only action came between rounds when the seconds straightened the wrestlers' Y-fronts and patted their bottoms. The horse races were better value, and the following morning I set off in a jeep, bouncing across the empty steppe to where a large crowd had assembled at a finish line in the middle of nowhere. Naadam races are run cross-country over marathon distances, 20 miles in the case of the Hovd races. People milled about in their hats, greeting one another with elaborate salutations. Many of the men had arrived in the same straw fedora whose hat bands bore the bewitching legend: Strength Through Milk. While we waited for the runners and riders to arrive, drinking parties were springing up on all sides. Mongols unpacked elaborate picnics of petrified cheese, dumplings and bottles of vodka with the brand-name of Genghis Khan. In no time, everyone was roaring drunk. I fell in with Ganbold, the local history teacher. Twenty years of teaching 14-year-olds about the glories of the communist revolution had honed his conversation to laborious banalities. Ganbold was a connoisseur of the obvious, never happier than when explaining something you already knew. The approach of the field was announced by a distant cloud of dust. \"The horses are coming,\" Ganbold explained helpfully. The vodka-sodden crowds pushed forward towards the finish line where three inebriated policemen threw stones at them to try to hold them back. As the horses began to emerge from the dust, a steward ran forward waving an enormous red flag to guide the riders to the unmarked finish line. A crescendo of whoops and whistles rose from the crowd. Young men hollered, women shrieked, old men stamped their feet, and babies, waving fat arms, burst into tears. The jockeys were children, both boys and girls, few of them older than eight, who had completed the course bareback and barefoot. In their paper race hats they looked as if they were returning from a rather jolly children's party, dazed with too much cake. As the first finishers crossed the line, the crowds broke ranks, overrunning the policemen and engulfing the lathered horses. Fathers caught hold of the bridles, sisters started frantically wiping the sweat from the flanks with special paddles, and mothers lifted their child jockeys down from the horses to revive them with fermented mare's milk. One horse collapsed a few yards from the finishing line. Its rider, a young girl of about seven, picked herself up and began to kick the horse in the chest, apparently the Mongolian equivalent of an equine kiss of life, meant to revive the poor creature. The owner had a more traditional remedy. He ran out from the crowd, produced a bottle of Genghis Khan from the folds of his del and poured the contents down the horse's throat. The effect was immediate. The animal leapt to its feet and hared off back towards Hovd, rider-less, without bothering to cross the finishing line. A steward's inquiry presumably disqualified the beast: \"retired, drunk\". Back at the stadium in the afternoon, the wrestling final was underway, when a great party of dishevelled horsemen arrived - the Naadam winners, their owners, their trainers, and their pals. To the roar of the crowd, they cantered round the arena beneath the terraces in a couple of laps of honour burying the wrestlers in veils of dust. For the presentation, the riders gathered beneath the equivalent of the royal box where the politicians were seated. Professional praise singers sang the praises of the horses, the races and riders in thrilling nasal arias. The governor, pleased at last to be the centre of attention, handed out the prizes - Chinese carpets and bricks of Russian tea - as if he had bought them himself. The grand prize, in this land of horsemen, was a Russian motorcycle. Actually, it was a promissory note for a motorcycle. Though ordered some months ago, the governor explained, the machine had yet to arrive. The winning trainer gazed at the note with the sceptical look of a man familiar with politicians' promises. Then amidst further whoops the horsemen galloped out of the stadium and we rediscovered the wrestling final. Not a lot had happened in the interval. The two colossi were as we had left them, like mating dogs that had got stuck. They might have been posing for a statue. We were rescued by a spectacular storm. Thunder rolled in from the mountains, rain swept round the terraces and the crowds fled. \"It's raining,\" Ganbold explained, pulling his trilby down over his ears. Within minutes, the stadium was empty save for the two immobilised wrestlers and a panel of judges sheltering beneath a leaky canopy. Hunched against the rain, the Mongolians ran to their horses, tethered in long rows in the horse park. Riding out of the dismal town, they cantered away towards the shelter of distant tents, laughing and calling to one another across the glistening plains. The next morning I followed them, turning my horse away from the dreary town into an enormous sweep of landscape. Ahead of me lay a thousand miles of Mongolia.

They pass the beautiful church of St Mary's - which has a bell but no clockface because the squire didn't want his labourers to waste time clock-watching - and cross two fields called Shootalong and the Butts. The fields are reminders of the 13th-century law that required the men of every village to practise archery in preparation for war against the French. </p> <p>Then comes a sharp climb up Ham Hill to what Ashdown calls \"one of the great views of Britain\". </p> <p>Ham Hill is an ancient, steep-sided neolithic earthwork, later used as a Roman garrison and an important location in Arthur's Britain. From here, in one sweep, you can see the lowland of the Somerset Levels, the Mendip Hills, Glastonbury Tor, Cadbury Castle and the distant Alfred's Tower, marking the site where Alfred the Great defeated the Danes. </p> <p>\"Ask me to choose the best time,\" says Ashdown, \"and I would say a late November evening when there's a frost and the mist is gathering down on the levels and you've got that slightly orange but steely light.\" </p> <p>There is an amphitheatre, believed to be Roman in origin and known locally as \"the frying pans\". Here, Gladstone and Lloyd-George addressed open-air meetings, and here, in 1997, Ashdown and his campaign manager, Lord Holme, decided they would work towards abandoning the long-established policy of \"equidistance\" between the two main parties. </p> <p>The route passes the northern point of the flat-topped hill where a tall obelisk commemorates the dead of the first world war. From there, it skirts the disused quarries which supplied the honey-coloured Ham stone for many local villages, and along the edge of Hedgecock Hill Wood to look down on the elegant chimneys and gardens of Montacute House. </p> <p>Its many claims to fame include a visit from Ashdown's favourite poet John Donne, a connection with the Gunpowder Plot, and a starring role in the recent film version of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. </p> <p>One of his favourite political anecdotes concerns the Conservative foreign secretary Lord Curzon spending the weekend at Montacute in the 1920s when he was called for on the occasion of the dissolution of the previous government. \"He was kept waiting at Yeovil station - not an unusual experience - and arrived at Waterloo expecting to be summoned to the King. Instead, he was met by the King's messenger who said, more or less, you took such a long time coming that we've asked Baldwin to do it instead. It wasn't quite like that, but that's the story.\" </p> <p>St Michael's Hill at the side of Montacute is believed to be the site of the last Saxon rebellion against the Normans, which was bloodily repressed: now it bears nothing more dramatic than an architectural folly. From here, the Ashdown route resolutely bypasses the King's Arms and turns south past the site of a Roman villa and the traces of the medieval village of Whitcombe. </p> <p>More political history lurks nearby in Pit Plain and Pit Wood, where you still find the rides and avenues designed by William Pitt the Younger, prime minister from 1783, when he lived at Montacute. Freshwater oysters, originally cultivated by the Romans, can still be found in a pond in the woods. </p> <p>Next comes the radicalism and Norton Covert, where Ashdown pauses to pay his respects to the Bubblers, a new-age community set up about seven years ago with the permission of South Somerset District Council: \"I made myself, I'm afraid, very unpopular with some in my village by supporting their application, and now they live in structures called yurts in the woods. </p> <p>\"People said they'd lower the price of property - absolute nonsense. Their kids go to the local schools, and I think it's given a quality to the village it wouldn't otherwise have had.\" </p> <p>The community takes its name from the Bubble, a natural spring on the way from Norton Covert to Little Norton. The Ashdown party might stop for a drink at the spring before pressing on to finish the walk with something a little stronger at the Lord Nelson. </p> <p>\"This really is one of the most glorious pieces of countryside in England,\" he says. \"I sometimes stand on Ham Hill and watch people on the A303 hurtling down to Cornwall, and I'm glad they're missing us out. </p> <p>\"Walking used not to be much of a pastime, and I can remember in 1970 we had to more or less cut the paths as we went.

      "body": "<p>All racists should be hospitalised. I say this not just on principle but because it is very hard to maintain racial prejudice while being cared for by the national health service.</p> <p>The reason why there are so many ethnic minority nurses is partly that governments have always imported workers at times of labour shortage. Britain has imported Irish nurses, canal diggers and railway builders. And in most of our major cities, where one can walk into a pub and not hear the words, \"You'm not be from rounds these parts, be thee?\", one finds a tendency for pub landlords to be Irish.</p> <p>The Ministry of Labour must have at some time realised that there was a major skills shortage in the licensing trade and that what was needed was an Irish publican movement. The English are not as well suited to the task for the simple reason that, whereas the Irish are determined to give people a drink and will use any means to do so, English landlords seem mainly concerned that people in their pubs should leave as soon as possible. The stroke of 11pm is merely the excuse they have been looking for all day.

      "bodyText": "All racists should be hospitalised. I say this not just on principle but because it is very hard to maintain racial prejudice while being cared for by the national health service. The reason why there are so many ethnic minority nurses is partly that governments have always imported workers at times of labour shortage. Britain has imported Irish nurses, canal diggers and railway builders. And in most of our major cities, where one can walk into a pub and not hear the words, \"You'm not be from rounds these parts, be thee?\", one finds a tendency for pub landlords to be Irish. The Ministry of Labour must have at some time realised that there was a major skills shortage in the licensing trade and that what was needed was an Irish publican movement. The English are not as well suited to the task for the simple reason that, whereas the Irish are determined to give people a drink and will use any means to do so, English landlords seem mainly concerned that people in their pubs should leave as soon as possible. The stroke of 11pm is merely the excuse they have been looking for all day. Conversely, if an Irish barman says: \"Come along now people, it's nearly half eleven\", it's because he's about to open up again for the lunchtime trade.

Rescuers were unable to reach the train compartment, but eight survivors managed to escape by smashing a rear window.</p> <p>The packed compartment was carrying about 180 skiers on their way up to the slopes. Salzburg governor Franz Schausberger has declared a day of mourning in the province after the worst skiing accident since 1976, when 42 people died in Italy after a cable snapped.</p> <p>All the people on board are believed to have suffocated. Many of the passengers were children.</p> <p>The train was reported to be around 600 metres inside the mountain when the fire started, hampering rescue efforts. It enters the mountainside after being hoisted up a steep ramp, supported by metal struts. State television said that the massive steel cable pulling the cars up the slope apparently broke before the fire broke out.</p> <p>Three people in the passenger area of the tunnel also died after inhaling smoke.</p> <p>\"I do not know anything about who is left on board the cable train but it is very difficult, because it is continuing to burn,\" said Gottfried Gamsjaeger of Salzburg police. \"We cannot get access to the carriages. It is still too early to know anything about the nationalities.\"</p> <p>It is not yet known whether any Britons were on board the train. A foreign office spokeswoman said they were in contact with the local authorities.</p> <p>Local mayor Norbert Karlsboeck said that the fire continued burning more than three hours after it broke out, sending smoke spewing out from the bottom of the tunnel. \"We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,\" Mr Karlsboeck said.</p> <p>The resort is a popular summer and early winter skiing area. Built in 1974, the cable railway was first the first of its kind to burrow through a mountainside. Experts interviewed on television said it was supposed to be fireproof.</p> <p>Thirty-nine people died last year in an inferno in the Mont Blanc road tunnel between France and Italy that began after a truck caught fire.</p> <p>Austrian police have issued an emergency hotline number for anyone concerned they may have relatives on the train.

      "bodyText": "At least 170 people died today when a train transporting skiers to an Austrian glacier resort caught fire, trapping them inside a burning car. Fire broke out at 9.30am in a train travelling within the Kirzsteinhorn mountain, about 50 miles south of Vienna. Rescuers were unable to reach the train compartment, but eight survivors managed to escape by smashing a rear window. The packed compartment was carrying about 180 skiers on their way up to the slopes. Salzburg governor Franz Schausberger has declared a day of mourning in the province after the worst skiing accident since 1976, when 42 people died in Italy after a cable snapped. All the people on board are believed to have suffocated. Many of the passengers were children. The train was reported to be around 600 metres inside the mountain when the fire started, hampering rescue efforts. It enters the mountainside after being hoisted up a steep ramp, supported by metal struts. State television said that the massive steel cable pulling the cars up the slope apparently broke before the fire broke out. Three people in the passenger area of the tunnel also died after inhaling smoke. \"I do not know anything about who is left on board the cable train but it is very difficult, because it is continuing to burn,\" said Gottfried Gamsjaeger of Salzburg police. \"We cannot get access to the carriages. It is still too early to know anything about the nationalities.\" It is not yet known whether any Britons were on board the train. A foreign office spokeswoman said they were in contact with the local authorities. Local mayor Norbert Karlsboeck said that the fire continued burning more than three hours after it broke out, sending smoke spewing out from the bottom of the tunnel. \"We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,\" Mr Karlsboeck said. The resort is a popular summer and early winter skiing area. Built in 1974, the cable railway was first the first of its kind to burrow through a mountainside. Experts interviewed on television said it was supposed to be fireproof. Thirty-nine people died last year in an inferno in the Mont Blanc road tunnel between France and Italy that began after a truck caught fire. Austrian police have issued an emergency hotline number for anyone concerned they may have relatives on the train. The number is 0043 654 720000.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions between France and Nato and bitter opposition from Turkey are holding up ambitious plans for the EU to develop a common European defence force, diplomats say. With a vital agreement between the EU and the western alliance due to be signed at a summit next month in Nice, unresolved problems over relations between the two sides are piling up. British officials said that they fear a sudden attempt by Jacques Chirac, the French president, to push EU defence too far away from Nato - fuelling longstanding anxiety in London and Washington that the alliance could be weakened. France, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, has long been ambivalent about its role in Nato. Alexander Vershbow, the US ambassador to Nato, warned of \"new political frictions in the transatlantic relationship\" if the EU creates a planning unit for its fledgling defence policy. \"The French agenda is to minimise Nato's input and there are anxieties about this,\" said one well-placed diplomat. Talks in Brussels on Thursday between the EU's security policy committee and Nato ambassadors failed to finalise an agreement for Nice, though the secretary-general, Lord Robertson, denied he had warned Tony Blair that the project was heading for crisis. Pioneered jointly by Britain and France, plans for EU defence have been developing quietly since 1998, but they were given a boost by the Kosovo crisis, which highlighted the weakness of Europe's military compared with that of the US. At last December's summit in Helsinki, EU leaders pledged to build a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force by 2003. The force would be deployed if Nato as a whole did not wish to get involved in a new crisis in, for example, the Balkans or Africa. Officials involved in negotiations complain that France has been trying to keep Nato \"at arm's length\" and worry that the Nice summit could adopt proposals leading to the sort of duplication the alliance insists must be avoided. Most European members of Nato want the EU to have automatic access to alliance planning - based at Mons, Belgium - in order to avoid the danger that Brussels will create its own structures. Lord Robertson said after Thursday's meeting that one of the key precepts of the defence effort was to ensure that there would be \"no unnecessary duplication\". But serious disagreements revolve around how tightly the EU should be locked into Nato in return for being able to borrow military assets such as specialist aircraft and intelligence capabilities. An important test comes later this month when EU defence ministers meet to announce their national contributions to the reaction force. After Nice there are plans for the first ever joint meeting of foreign ministers from the EU and Nato. Washington backs the goal of a European security and defence identity but it has repeatedly warned the EU not to decouple transatlantic ties or discriminate against non-EU Nato allies. Of these the most important is Turkey, always sensitive about its poor relationship with Europe, which has been blocking EU requests for sensitive Nato documents. But one idea now under consideration is to \"sweeten\" the Turks by asking them to host one of the three permanent military headquarters planned for the future European force. \"People are well aware that deadlines are looming and that there is still a lot of work to be done,\" one alliance official said last night.",

He wore aviator shades in the sunshine. \"It's a beautiful day for it, like,\" he said.

You worked long hours, agreed to any and all management suggestions, laughed at the boss's jokes and talked in loud tones about \"being with the company for life\". But nowadays, with the workplace becoming increasingly idiosyncratic and fractured, the factors that contribute to being promoted can differ hugely between industries, offices and individual managers. </p> <p>\"For me, it's enthusiasm for the job that really counts,\" says Bill Vestey, general manager of corporate affairs at Sony. \"If there were two candidates up for a promotion and they were both equally competent and experienced, I would give the job to the one who was most enthusiastic about the company and their position in it.\" </p> <p>Jo Johnson, director of BGB &amp; Associates, a travel and leisure PR company, also believes in the importance of enthusiasm, particularly if it translates into a willingness to make every effort. \"In our business we obviously do everything we can for our clients, who are basically customers,\" she says, \"but I tend to be impressed by people who make that much effort for everyone - clients, colleagues or other business partners that we work with.\" </p> <p>Obviously there are some common factors across all industries when it comes to promoting someone - relevant experience, qualifications, positive attitude and dedication to the job. But even these are changing. \"The idea that working long hours will increase your chances of promotion isn't necessarily true any more,\" says Richard Wilson, business policy executive at the Institute of Directors. \"In some industries it will - in many finance houses and law firms, long hours are expected if you want to get on.

If he or she is constantly looking to you for ideas and asking you for your opinions, then it's important to work on your own initiative and be creative. This is especially relevant in e-commerce businesses. \"Dotcom companies are very new and far less hierarchical than conventional companies,\" says Nick Robertson, MD of AsSeenOnScreen.com, a site which sells products seen in films and TV programmes. \"It's hard to employ people with experience, because it's such a new industry, so you rely on people to be self-starters and to come up with ideas which they will then go and research.\" </p> <p>According to Nick, the key factors if succeeding in a dotcom company are confidence and creativity. \"I am impressed by people who come to me - whether it's the receptionist or the marketing manager - with ways to develop the company and with interesting thoughts about new strategies.

      "body": "<p>Thinking of applying for a new job? Can't stand your boss? Caught the managing director in a compromising position at the office Christmas party? Don't tell anyone. If you do, the chances are the story will spread as quickly as the \"news\" about what Leonardo di Caprio got up to with both Appleton sisters in the bathroom at The Beach premiere party. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, far be it from me to perpetuate gossip). </p> <p>Britain's employees, it seems, are not to be trusted. A recent survey by recruitment consultant Office Angels discovered that office </p> <p>workers are incapable of keeping a secret. More than 90% of employees admitted they'd shared secrets after being specifically asked not to. And, if you need proof of the old adage that \"gossip spreads like wildfire\", 77% had passed the gossip on to at least two other people within the same working day. </p> <p>The survey of 1,500 office workers found that two thirds of us can't keep our traps shut about our colleagues' office frustrations, promotions and pay rises or new job applications. And we're almost certain to gossip about personal information, such as relationships, health or money. </p> <p>So, why can't we keep our lips sealed when we're asked to? Because, says psychologist Sandi Mann of the University of Central Lancashire, \"Knowledge is power. But, unlike children who can get away with saying: 'I've got a secret and I'm not going to tell you what it is', adults are impotent unless they pass the knowledge on.\" </p> <p>There's no thrill in being the first to know something if no-one else knows what it is. Indeed, in the survey 36% of people admitted they craved the attention associated with revealing information and a devious one in five used their new found knowledge as a means to demonstrate power. </p> <p>A foolish 1 in 10 just couldn't help themselves - the secret slipped out \"by accident\". </p> <p>Most of us, with the exception of newspaper gossip columnists, follow a misguided \"moral\" code. When we pass on a secret we think it doesn't count if we say: \"You mustn't tell anyone else this.\" As Sandi Mann explains: \"People feel </p> <p>they're justified because they perceive that the information is still confidential,\" </p> <p>Kissing and telling has brought down many an MP, the odd government and - very nearly - the president of the United States. It can also be detrimental to your career. Two out of three bosses questioned in the survey say they'll never again trust an employee who discloses company secrets. And 4% have sacked staff with verbal diarrhoea. </p> <p>Of course, bosses can use the gossip grapevine to their advantage too. John (not his real name) used to work as creative director at a large publishing company. He says that he was able to manipulate his slippery-tongued staff by starting rumours which he knew would leak out: \"If I wanted my team to work harder, I might tell a particularly big-mouthed member that someone wasn't pulling their weight and could be taken off a project. Within hours, I could be certain that everybody would become more conscientious. It was sneaky, but far more productive than calling a meeting and directly telling people to knuckle down. </p> <p>\"And if I had suspicions that someone in my team wasn't to be trusted, I'd confide some untrue information to them - and make them swear not to tell. If it got out, I'd know that my instincts were correct.\" </p> <p>No-one is immune to gossip. What's important is how you play the game. \"You have to be very careful,\" warns Angela Baron, an adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Spiteful or sexual remarks can border on bullying or harassment. If something is offensive, you'd be wise not to pass it on or you might risk being disciplined. Likewise, you should never ever discuss trade secrets or team developments, especially with clients. If you gossip about confidential data, you might be contravening the data protection legislation or rights to privacy under the new Human Rights Act.\" </p> <p>Sandi Mann says there's no doubt we find out more from the grapevine than through formal means: \"Everybody knows this, which is why we listen to gossip. My advice is: don't spread gossip, but don't ignore it either. If you refuse to listen to it, you might miss out on useful information.\" </p> <p>If, for example, you've found out your boss is a huge Barry Manilow fan, it won't do your promotional prospects any harm if you start humming Cococabana as you pass her (well it must be, mustn't it?) desk. Heard about an impending merger? It might be true, so you can start looking around for another job in plenty of time. </p> <p>What if you've let an entire pride of lions out of the bag? Can you salvage your reputation and redeem yourself? It depends on the seriousness of the secret you let slip - and on the forgiving nature of the person whose confidence you betrayed. \"You could go to them and apologise,\" suggests Sandi Mann. \"They might be grateful for your honesty and forgive you. Then again, they might fire you. </p> <p>\"Alternatively - and this is more risky - you could send out a contrary rumour to diffuse your original rumour.\" Told everyone your boss is having an affair? Actually, the woman you saw him with is his wife; she's just lost lots of weight and was wearing a blonde wig. </p> <p>According to Angela Baron, gossip shouldn't be banned because it plays such an important role in organisations: \"Employers are well aware that allowing employees to chat to each other breeds new ideas. The free exchange of ideas should be encouraged, but gossip can be damaging. It's important that organisations put frameworks in place so people understand what the limits are and what is confidential, but creativity is given free reign.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thinking of applying for a new job? Can't stand your boss? Caught the managing director in a compromising position at the office Christmas party? Don't tell anyone. If you do, the chances are the story will spread as quickly as the \"news\" about what Leonardo di Caprio got up to with both Appleton sisters in the bathroom at The Beach premiere party. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, far be it from me to perpetuate gossip). Britain's employees, it seems, are not to be trusted. A recent survey by recruitment consultant Office Angels discovered that office workers are incapable of keeping a secret. More than 90% of employees admitted they'd shared secrets after being specifically asked not to. And, if you need proof of the old adage that \"gossip spreads like wildfire\", 77% had passed the gossip on to at least two other people within the same working day. The survey of 1,500 office workers found that two thirds of us can't keep our traps shut about our colleagues' office frustrations, promotions and pay rises or new job applications. And we're almost certain to gossip about personal information, such as relationships, health or money. So, why can't we keep our lips sealed when we're asked to? Because, says psychologist Sandi Mann of the University of Central Lancashire, \"Knowledge is power. But, unlike children who can get away with saying: 'I've got a secret and I'm not going to tell you what it is', adults are impotent unless they pass the knowledge on.\" There's no thrill in being the first to know something if no-one else knows what it is. Indeed, in the survey 36% of people admitted they craved the attention associated with revealing information and a devious one in five used their new found knowledge as a means to demonstrate power. A foolish 1 in 10 just couldn't help themselves - the secret slipped out \"by accident\". Most of us, with the exception of newspaper gossip columnists, follow a misguided \"moral\" code. When we pass on a secret we think it doesn't count if we say: \"You mustn't tell anyone else this.\" As Sandi Mann explains: \"People feel they're justified because they perceive that the information is still confidential,\" Kissing and telling has brought down many an MP, the odd government and - very nearly - the president of the United States. It can also be detrimental to your career. Two out of three bosses questioned in the survey say they'll never again trust an employee who discloses company secrets. And 4% have sacked staff with verbal diarrhoea. Of course, bosses can use the gossip grapevine to their advantage too. John (not his real name) used to work as creative director at a large publishing company. He says that he was able to manipulate his slippery-tongued staff by starting rumours which he knew would leak out: \"If I wanted my team to work harder, I might tell a particularly big-mouthed member that someone wasn't pulling their weight and could be taken off a project. Within hours, I could be certain that everybody would become more conscientious. It was sneaky, but far more productive than calling a meeting and directly telling people to knuckle down. \"And if I had suspicions that someone in my team wasn't to be trusted, I'd confide some untrue information to them - and make them swear not to tell. If it got out, I'd know that my instincts were correct.\" No-one is immune to gossip. What's important is how you play the game. \"You have to be very careful,\" warns Angela Baron, an adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Spiteful or sexual remarks can border on bullying or harassment. If something is offensive, you'd be wise not to pass it on or you might risk being disciplined. Likewise, you should never ever discuss trade secrets or team developments, especially with clients. If you gossip about confidential data, you might be contravening the data protection legislation or rights to privacy under the new Human Rights Act.\" Sandi Mann says there's no doubt we find out more from the grapevine than through formal means: \"Everybody knows this, which is why we listen to gossip. My advice is: don't spread gossip, but don't ignore it either. If you refuse to listen to it, you might miss out on useful information.\" If, for example, you've found out your boss is a huge Barry Manilow fan, it won't do your promotional prospects any harm if you start humming Cococabana as you pass her (well it must be, mustn't it?) desk. Heard about an impending merger? It might be true, so you can start looking around for another job in plenty of time. What if you've let an entire pride of lions out of the bag? Can you salvage your reputation and redeem yourself? It depends on the seriousness of the secret you let slip - and on the forgiving nature of the person whose confidence you betrayed. \"You could go to them and apologise,\" suggests Sandi Mann. \"They might be grateful for your honesty and forgive you. Then again, they might fire you. \"Alternatively - and this is more risky - you could send out a contrary rumour to diffuse your original rumour.\" Told everyone your boss is having an affair? Actually, the woman you saw him with is his wife; she's just lost lots of weight and was wearing a blonde wig. According to Angela Baron, gossip shouldn't be banned because it plays such an important role in organisations: \"Employers are well aware that allowing employees to chat to each other breeds new ideas. The free exchange of ideas should be encouraged, but gossip can be damaging. It's important that organisations put frameworks in place so people understand what the limits are and what is confidential, but creativity is given free reign.\"",

      "body": "<p>The death of the intellectual has left a void in public life\". This obituary was posted in October 1997, when Michael Ignatieff lamented that public debate in Britain had been handed over to the \"worthy professors, cultural bureaucrats, carnival barkers and entertainers\". It has become a familiar refrain. Not so long ago, it is claimed, there were intellectual figures of real eminence who acted as guides to the perplexing business of living, sages who would be listened to with respect. But now it has become impossible to command that kind of cultural authority: not only will people no longer listen, but intellectual specialisation means that no single figure can possess the necessary range to address a broad audience. There may be experts, but there are no longer any sages.</p> <p>It is always difficult to sift out what is genuinely new about the historical moment through which we are living from the various illusory novelties generated by combining a highly selective view of the present with a thin and foreshortened view of the past. But as soon as we start to take a longer perspective we realise that laments about the intellectual's lack or loss of cultural authority are as old as the concept itself. After all, the occasion which is usually credited with giving birth to the modern concept of \"the intellectual\", the Dreyfus Affair in France in 1898, also generated the first in a long line of objections to the very idea of such an exercise of cultural authority when the conservative litt\u00e9rateur Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re asked rhetorically \"what right has a professor of Tibetan to instruct his fellow citizens about politics?\"</p> <p>This singling out of a hypothetical \"professor\" as a peculiarly unpersuasive claimant of authority did not merely reflect the circumstances of the Dreyfus Affair, for the enormous growth of higher education since the late 19th century has been in itself one of the major forces of cultural change. The statistics are striking: in 1939 there were about 50,000 university students in Britain; by 1960 this had doubled to about 100,000. By 1988 the figure had reached 580,000, and by the end of the century almost one million. There was a corresponding increase in academics, and what goes on in universities - including their alleged scandals - now bulks much larger in the public culture than 50 years ago.</p> <p>Of course, it is by no means true that all intellectuals have been academics, and even less that all academics have been intellectuals: but at the heart of the notion of \"the intellectual\" has been a movement between two poles, going beyond an initial source of standing or respect in order to \"speak out\" to a broader public, and the university has come more and more to be seen as a major, perhaps the major, home of that initial standing. It is precisely this movement \"out\", we are told, that has become impossible or ineffectual today. But is it true that intellectuals in general, and academics in particular, used to possess this authority and have now lost it? There is no question that part of what we, in Britain as in other comparable societies, are living through is a further, and considerably speeded-up, instalment of a long process of cultural democratisation. A crucial aspect of this process has been the way in which intellectual standing has more and more been stripped of merely historical or contingent association with social standing. Where the \"crisis of authority\" theorists go wrong is in confusing the decline in deference towards social superiority with the disappearance of cultural authority as such, and hence as entailing \"the death of the intellectual\".</p> <p>As in most scenarios of \"decline\", considerable historical foreshortening is involved. The fact is that alarmists in each generation have confidently announced that, as a result of changes in the social structure or the rise of new media or the expansion of higher education, the age of the general intellectual has come to an end and the era of the mere specialist or expert is upon us. Yet history has each time confounded the pessimists.</p> <p>In the 20s, for example, highly educated commentators predicted that the arrival of such populist media as radio would leave no room for serious attention to art and ideas. But any listener to The Third Programme a generation later would have had to admit that the medium had in fact furnished intellectuals with a new and highly congenial platform. Again, in the 60s it was no less confidently predicted that the era of the serious periodical was drawing to a close: old titles were folding, there would be no call for new ones. But again, a generation later, new titles such as the London Review of Books or Prospect seem in rude health, and are providing the intellectuals of our time with some of the same opportunities that their predecessors found in Encounter, or the Nation, or the Fortnightly, and so on all the way back to the original Edinburgh and Quarterly reviews in the early 19th century.</p> <p>One thing that has changed is the assumption that members of the traditional upper classes were automatically authorities on \"culture\" and vice versa. From its foundation in 1946, the Third Programme did indeed carry an impressive range of serious artistic and intellectual programmes, but it displayed some highly conventional assumptions about where \"serious\" ideas were to be found: debates from the Oxford Union were broadcast live, and anyone now listening to recordings of talks and discussions from that time might infer that regional balance was provided by having speakers from Winchester as well as from Eton.</p> <p>Something similar could be said for other media of that period. As late as the 60s, the great cardinals of the Sunday review pages - the Cyril Connollys, Philip Toynbees, and Raymond Mortimers - clearly represented the old alliance of high culture, and high social class (with a dash of high Modernism, too, in several cases, which tended to add a \"European\" spice to the authority). Not only could they tell a sonnet from a villanelle, but also a Chateauneuf from a Chambertin, and these were accepted as related forms of cultivation. Readers of the \"quality\" Sundays still by and large expected their cultural tastes to be arbitrated by members of \"the quality\".</p> <p>And more generally, a delicate balance may be said to have obtained in the middle decades of the 20th century, when certain leading dons began for the first time to become frequent contributors to popular media (for example, AJP Taylor or Bertrand Russell). For a while, they were still able to trade on old snobberies and that taken-for-granted association of the ancient universities with the country's cultural elite, but in subsequent decades these sources of deference diminished considerably as newly prosperous strata increasingly determined the nature of media that owed no allegiance to the tastes of that cultivated milieu. Today, any academic who appears regularly in such settings risks being regarded as merely one \"personality\" among others, much less famous than pop stars and footballers, and some way below astrologers, TV chefs, and gardening experts.</p> <p>The social changes which have undermined much of the deference from which earlier generations of academic intellectuals profited were touched upon in the first of these articles. They include increased prosperity and hence much greater market power for the bulk of the population, as well as the impact of technological innovation such as the rise of visual and electronic media. Increasingly egalitarian attitudes (notwithstanding the evidence of stark inequalities) have deprived many of the old markers of social standing of their power. More specifically, there has been a loss of status for academics as a result of the huge expansion of higher education and what has been termed the \"proletarianisation\" of the profession of university teacher: a \"professor\", whether of Tibetan or (more likely) of Tourism, is no longer a substantial figure in the local or national community.</p> <p>But perhaps at this point we should pause and question the very idea of there being a single \"national community\" as far as cultural and intellectual life is concerned. Perhaps it was only ever an habitual complacency about their and their friends' importance which allowed leading public figures of earlier ages to think that they addressed, or even spoke \"for\", such a community in the first place. Certainly, the increased recognition of the competing claims of various \"subcultures\", whether defined in terms of ethnicity and gender or of musical taste and body piercing, has made such complacency harder to sustain. This does not mean that the ambition to address some kind of broad, non-specialist public has disappeared, just that it has to acknowledge its own social location and the legitimate interests of other, sometimes very different, locations. And this is surely a gain.</p> <p>These longterm social changes have been compounded by three more recent cultural developments. The first is the way in which, partly as a consequence of the cultural democratization mentioned earlier, the public discourses of our society reflect an unease about the exercise of informed judgment. A broadly diffused but inconsistently held value relativism is at work here. People fear that judgment, the discrimination of better from worse in almost any sphere, is \"elitist\", even snobbish, masking mere prejudice and in concrete cases sheer favouritism. By contrast, measurement appears more palatable: it retains the aura of being impersonal, objective, open, even democratic. Measurement is thought of as a technical skill and therefore (it is falsely assumed) as value-neutral. Rational argument about one thing being more valuable or more worthwhile than another constantly threatens to be displaced by mere head-counting: when \"what people want\" is sovereign, the pollster speaks with more authority than the philosopher.</p> <p>The second change which has accelerated recently is the rate of intellectual specialisation and professionalisation. Disciplines spawn subdisciplines; technical vocabularies become more arcane; the pressures on academics to stick to specialised research become more intense. The transnational research community becomes the \"public\" that counts - and the Research Assessment Exercise is the mechanism for counting it. In most scientific and scholarly fields, addressing a non-specialist audience is regarded as the equivalent of voluntary work in the community.</p> <p>The third development concerns the way in which populist media promote the dynamics of celebrity even in the intellectual field: we have Spice Dons as well as Spice Girls. Celebrity, of course, depends entirely on the attention of the relevant media, and is therefore to some extent self-sustaining: notoriously, celebrities are in the end nothing more than people who are \"famous for being famous\". The shift from \"Big Brother is watching you\" to \"You are watching Big Brother\" is not just about depoliticisation or the development of more interactive forms of \"mass\" culture: it is fundamentally driven by the mechanism of the celebrity economy. The important thing is to be known and recognised, even if it is only for how you take a shower in front of six million people.</p> <p>The extended power of the celebrity mill is particularly consequential for the role of the intellectual. Expertise, reputation, and celebrity may all be elements in cultural authority, but they each operate in different ways, and in recent years celebrity has increasingly threatened to out-trump the other two. Here the danger for media-friendly academics, is that by constantly seeking exposure and agreeing to make such pronouncements they risk forfeiting much of the authority upon which their public role was initially founded, and so to maintain their \"visibility\" they are forced into the vicious circle of pursuing celebrity itself through factitious controversy and sheer opinionatedness.</p> <p>These developments are certainly important, but again we have to remember that ours is not the first generation to have to grapple with some variant of such forces. There is a long line of social critics who have challenged the assumptions about \"consumer sovereignty\", \"popular taste\", and other forms of \"the evacuation of value\" built into the public vocabulary dominant in their time. Attempts to counter the narrowing effects of scholarly specialisation can be traced back at least to the mid-19th century; Arnold's idea of \"culture\" was intended to do precisely that, after all. It is true that the insidious pressures constantly working to convert reputation into celebrity and reasoned arguments into mere soundbites do tend to catch academics, in particular, off-balance, as they find themselves unversed in the ways of imposing their perspective on the media rather than the reverse. But here, too, there are encouraging exemplars from the past (think of Jacob Bronowski on television) and in such cases today (Simon Schama, or Germaine Greer) skillful exploitation of the medium can amplify rather than diminish the reputation.</p> <p>Intellectuals, in Britain as elsewhere, can rely less and less upon the deference formerly accorded to irrelevant or merely contingent social attributes and connections, but the obituary notices may none the less be premature. The very processes which appear to make it more difficult for reasoned argument, informed judgment, and a broad perspective to get a hearing in the public domain simultaneously generate a corresponding hunger for those qualities. A diet of media-degradable soundbites can also stimulate an appetite for something more substantial. It is a good bet that a future historian surveying cultural change in Britain in the first half of the 21st century will find, amid developments which may at present be scarcely imaginable, that this appetite will have continued to find serious fare to chew.</p> <p>\u0095 Stefan Collini is Reader in Intellectual History and English Literature at Cambridge University</p>",

Expertise, reputation, and celebrity may all be elements in cultural authority, but they each operate in different ways, and in recent years celebrity has increasingly threatened to out-trump the other two. Here the danger for media-friendly academics, is that by constantly seeking exposure and agreeing to make such pronouncements they risk forfeiting much of the authority upon which their public role was initially founded, and so to maintain their \"visibility\" they are forced into the vicious circle of pursuing celebrity itself through factitious controversy and sheer opinionatedness. These developments are certainly important, but again we have to remember that ours is not the first generation to have to grapple with some variant of such forces. There is a long line of social critics who have challenged the assumptions about \"consumer sovereignty\", \"popular taste\", and other forms of \"the evacuation of value\" built into the public vocabulary dominant in their time. Attempts to counter the narrowing effects of scholarly specialisation can be traced back at least to the mid-19th century; Arnold's idea of \"culture\" was intended to do precisely that, after all. It is true that the insidious pressures constantly working to convert reputation into celebrity and reasoned arguments into mere soundbites do tend to catch academics, in particular, off-balance, as they find themselves unversed in the ways of imposing their perspective on the media rather than the reverse. But here, too, there are encouraging exemplars from the past (think of Jacob Bronowski on television) and in such cases today (Simon Schama, or Germaine Greer) skillful exploitation of the medium can amplify rather than diminish the reputation. Intellectuals, in Britain as elsewhere, can rely less and less upon the deference formerly accorded to irrelevant or merely contingent social attributes and connections, but the obituary notices may none the less be premature. The very processes which appear to make it more difficult for reasoned argument, informed judgment, and a broad perspective to get a hearing in the public domain simultaneously generate a corresponding hunger for those qualities. A diet of media-degradable soundbites can also stimulate an appetite for something more substantial. It is a good bet that a future historian surveying cultural change in Britain in the first half of the 21st century will find, amid developments which may at present be scarcely imaginable, that this appetite will have continued to find serious fare to chew. \u0095 Stefan Collini is Reader in Intellectual History and English Literature at Cambridge University",

      "body": "<p>Vogue, 1951: a picture of a debutante-type in twinset and pearls in a country pub staring at the camera, as is the flat-capped local chap next her. The caption: \"The theme: poise, dignity, the respect of person for person and class for class. The girl, quiet in dress and manners, waits while her husband gets drinks. The man \u0085 has unselfconsciously pinned a rose in his coat.\" These snobbish words reafirm what fashion had long been, an amusing visual aspect of the life of those born to privilege. But the picture by Norman Parkinson, a postwar photographer with a fresh eye for real ambience, already suggests a changed world. It doesn't record an outfit created for any regular engagement on a social calendar: the presence of that girl (she looks a mature 25), in those clothes, in that place, is a story.</p> <p>The most significant garment in the picture, the girl's skirt, is obscured under a shove ha'penny board, but it is a fair bet that its length and shape had been determined by the season's shows at Paris couture houses, especially that of Christian Dior. His house had been launched in 1947, substantially backed by textile magnate Marcel Boussac in the justified hope that Dior's creations would help re-establish French pre-eminence in luxury trades. That launch marked not just a change in fashion (with Dior's outrageously lavish New Look, followed by annual resculpturings of the female form by Dior and other Paris couturiers through the 50s), but a change in the basis of the business of selling apparel: as Valerie Steele, chief curator at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, says, it inaugurated the modern era when \"fashion was restructured and reconceived as big business and high art\".</p> <p>Boussac, among others, accurately foresaw the boom of the next half-century, in which newly prosperous classes first reached up for status through enhanced personal appearance - what John Berger once described as the Cinderella transformation. New consumers viewed proliferating fashion images not as confirmations of the enviability of the lives they already led, but as the pattern of what their lives might be if they wore the look (by purchasing a copy, or a copy of a copy). They were inspired by what Steele calls \"a handful of designers who could be promoted as stars\"; and, allured by media reaction to couture's extremes, they bought at least perfumes and small luxuries bearing Parisian names. Most importantly, they were sensitised to spending a higher proportion of income on bigger wardrobes with shorter wearing-spans.</p> <p>But their interest and expenditure was minor compared with that of the next generation - those who had their own disposable incomes by the 60s. Couture's lead was augmented, and then supplanted, by younger designers way outside Paris, directly selling informal clothes to their contemporaries through minimally capitalised shops, where retailing was a social event - the boutique trip as party. Vogue, its message amplified by new magazines targetting 16-24-year-olds, proposed to the boomers that fashion had become a complete, desirable way of life, in synthesis with the expanding music business. A 1966 David Bailey photograph of the wife of a Beatle poses her in a studio in the latest London ready-to-wear, cosmetics and haircut (she looks a faux-naive 18): the caption mentions only names, prices and stockists. Simply the presence of the fashionable young is the story.</p> <p>Fashion 2000 has gone far beyond being an optional passion for young adults: it saturates all aspects of all lives, with every object, environment and belief subject to accelerated marketing cycles of modishness and disposability.

      "bodyText": "Vogue, 1951: a picture of a debutante-type in twinset and pearls in a country pub staring at the camera, as is the flat-capped local chap next her. The caption: \"The theme: poise, dignity, the respect of person for person and class for class. The girl, quiet in dress and manners, waits while her husband gets drinks. The man \u0085 has unselfconsciously pinned a rose in his coat.\" These snobbish words reafirm what fashion had long been, an amusing visual aspect of the life of those born to privilege. But the picture by Norman Parkinson, a postwar photographer with a fresh eye for real ambience, already suggests a changed world. It doesn't record an outfit created for any regular engagement on a social calendar: the presence of that girl (she looks a mature 25), in those clothes, in that place, is a story. The most significant garment in the picture, the girl's skirt, is obscured under a shove ha'penny board, but it is a fair bet that its length and shape had been determined by the season's shows at Paris couture houses, especially that of Christian Dior. His house had been launched in 1947, substantially backed by textile magnate Marcel Boussac in the justified hope that Dior's creations would help re-establish French pre-eminence in luxury trades. That launch marked not just a change in fashion (with Dior's outrageously lavish New Look, followed by annual resculpturings of the female form by Dior and other Paris couturiers through the 50s), but a change in the basis of the business of selling apparel: as Valerie Steele, chief curator at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, says, it inaugurated the modern era when \"fashion was restructured and reconceived as big business and high art\". Boussac, among others, accurately foresaw the boom of the next half-century, in which newly prosperous classes first reached up for status through enhanced personal appearance - what John Berger once described as the Cinderella transformation. New consumers viewed proliferating fashion images not as confirmations of the enviability of the lives they already led, but as the pattern of what their lives might be if they wore the look (by purchasing a copy, or a copy of a copy). They were inspired by what Steele calls \"a handful of designers who could be promoted as stars\"; and, allured by media reaction to couture's extremes, they bought at least perfumes and small luxuries bearing Parisian names. Most importantly, they were sensitised to spending a higher proportion of income on bigger wardrobes with shorter wearing-spans. But their interest and expenditure was minor compared with that of the next generation - those who had their own disposable incomes by the 60s. Couture's lead was augmented, and then supplanted, by younger designers way outside Paris, directly selling informal clothes to their contemporaries through minimally capitalised shops, where retailing was a social event - the boutique trip as party. Vogue, its message amplified by new magazines targetting 16-24-year-olds, proposed to the boomers that fashion had become a complete, desirable way of life, in synthesis with the expanding music business. A 1966 David Bailey photograph of the wife of a Beatle poses her in a studio in the latest London ready-to-wear, cosmetics and haircut (she looks a faux-naive 18): the caption mentions only names, prices and stockists. Simply the presence of the fashionable young is the story. Fashion 2000 has gone far beyond being an optional passion for young adults: it saturates all aspects of all lives, with every object, environment and belief subject to accelerated marketing cycles of modishness and disposability. Western women (and men) own more clothes than did rich prewar style-setters, and reject them ever faster, even though the raw materials and workmanship of mass-produced clothes have been upgraded. Never in history have so many been able to purchase such quality fabrics assembled by skilled workers, albeit often in global sweatshops. Vogue, reinforced by kiosks crammed with magazines (soon to stock Vogue Teen aimed at 12-15-year-olds), insists that fashionable appearance is the primary purpose of every woman: the 1951 requirement for investment in clothes, and the 1966 bills for cosmetics and hair, have been supplemented by demands for faces and bodies reshaped and resurfaced at huge outlay of time, money and effort.

On the other hand, the popular art that spoke to the majority was dismissed as formally simplistic or sentimentally inclined. There were snobs on both sides and both views spoke eloquently of prejudice. However, it seemed to me, there was always something to recommend the plebeian point of view. High art spoke a patrician language which brooked little real conversation with anything of relevance to ordinary people and the snobbery that dismissed popular forms seemed to be a tautology: popular art was bad simply because it was plebian.

People who aspired to make horror movies would quote Tarkovsky as their favourite film-maker. I came to realise that what is deemed as the Hollywood narrative tradition was largely developed by European \"high art\" emigr\u00e9s.

They were glamour too, and romance, and sex - she didn't like to admit to having \"favourites\" but she did, Tyrone Power, Gregory Peck and, a bit later, Elvis. Watching any of these could make her blush or flush. My father teased her about it, gently. He had other things on his mind - like making sure my sister was still drawing the line between a bit of slap-and-tickle, and the unthinkable. It is a tribute to his flexibility, to my sister's perseverance, and to the distance they both travelled together that when one Sunday breakfast-time she broke into a bit of music-hall of her own - \"To have a poke with a bloke may be quite accidental / Durex is a girl's best friend\" - my mother only spluttered with pretend outrage and my father just smiled awkwardly and smoothed his moustache with the back of his hand, first one side then the other.</p> <p>A modest man, it was his good-natured way of acknowledging something immodest.

Even today no textbook account of postwar social developments can get by without its four- or five-page recension, and the book's influence hangs over fiction written in and about the time.</p> <p>The Hoggart thesis has suffered so often at the hands of sympathetic commentators anxious to prove the negative effects of mass culture on \"ordinary life\" that it is worth restating it in the author's own terms. His argument was not, as he put it, \"that there was, in England one generation ago, an urban culture still very much 'of the people' and that now there is only a mass urban culture.\" Rather, it was that the appeals made by what he called \"the mass publicists\" were made \"more insistently, effectively and in a more comprehensive and centralised form today than they were earlier; that we are moving towards the creation of a mass culture, that the remnants of what was at least in part an urban culture \"of the people\" are being destroyed\".</p> <p>In his studies of cheap novels and magazines, popular newspapers and postwar cinema, Hoggart detected drift on almost every side. The old, close, tightly-knit working-class culture of stuffy front rooms, allotments, back-to-back housing and charabanc trips was breaking up. In its place was emerging a mass culture composed of tabloid newspapers, advertising and Hollywood. Forty years later, it is important to realise that what Hoggart is complaining about is not popular culture - defined as the ordinary routines of working-class life - but mass culture. This is a serious distinction. After all, when an early 21st century critic laments the victory of \"popular culture\", the chances are that he or she means McDonald's, Rupert Murdoch and the Daily Mirror - in other words something that is imposed on the populace from above.</p> <p>The value that Hoggart found in \"popular\" culture, whether lived out in working men's clubs or around the family hearth, lay in what he saw as its fundamental integrity, but also in the fact that it was self-created, broadly sui generis, evolving according to its own laws and dictates rather than at the promptings of the mass media. Using this as a yardstick, it is tempting to wonder whether such a thing as \"popular culture\" still exists, whether TV, the VCR and the Kentucky Fried Chicken bar on every corner haven't simply ironed out genuine manifestations of popular will and choice into a uniform consumerist whole.</p> <p>At the same time, the cultural landscape of the past five decades is littered with the bones of more or less unforced manifestations of popular taste. Practically any musical movement of the last 40 years, for example, can be traced back to a crucible far beneath the mass-cultural assembly line. The early 60s beat boom, and by extension the Beatles, began with merchant seamen bringing back obscure American rhythm 'n' blues records back to Merseyside. \"Mod\" started life in a handful of west London pubs, just as a dozen years later punk rock crawled off the streets of London and Manchester, and a dozen years after that the popularity of a new kind of dance music and the availability of a new kind of recreational drug combined to produce Acid House. The essential element of these movements was that no one - no music press journalist or marketing baron - had foreseen them. They had simply taken root somewhere in the subculture before growing to the point where the media was prepared to take an interest.</p> <p>It hardly needs saying, of course, that \"media interest\" nearly always means an immediate expropriation and assimilation by the mass culture. But very occasionally, a genuinely \"popular\" phenomenon manages to survive and prosper beyond the constricting net of the mass culture and the mass audience. A good example from the world of music might be the \"Northern Soul\" movement of the 60s and 70s. Centred on the famous Wigan Casino and various other up-country venues, based on rosters of little-known records imported from the States, it inspired a fanatical following of weekending dancers and its own patterns and rituals, without ever finding the wider commercial interest to extend it beyond its original base.</p> <p>Elsewhere, if any of the threads of the genuine \"popular culture\" whose disappearance Hoggart was regretting 40 years ago still exist, they do so far out of sight, deep down on the factory floor or the street corner - in hobbies and small-scale activities that the tabloid newspapers and television have never approached. Oddly enough, out beyond the cultural horse collar of the M25, there are still substantial numbers of people taking part in Cumberland wrestling, pigeon racing, caged-bird fancying and whippet-rearing.</p> <p>Such things go unreported and unexploited by the mass media merely because there is no money in them, but they are there. Even a car boot sale, that odd 80s version of the street market, represents \"popular culture\" at work at the most basic level: something self-creating and with its own private ordinances. Richard Hoggart would probably be appalled to think that the, undoubtedly limited, but also warm and comfortable working-class world he described in The Uses of Literacy should come to rest in a semi-circle of hucksters selling counterfeit videos from the backs of cars. But given the ravages that mass culture has wrought on our national life in the past half-century, even this is a survival of a sort.</p>",

The value that Hoggart found in \"popular\" culture, whether lived out in working men's clubs or around the family hearth, lay in what he saw as its fundamental integrity, but also in the fact that it was self-created, broadly sui generis, evolving according to its own laws and dictates rather than at the promptings of the mass media. Using this as a yardstick, it is tempting to wonder whether such a thing as \"popular culture\" still exists, whether TV, the VCR and the Kentucky Fried Chicken bar on every corner haven't simply ironed out genuine manifestations of popular will and choice into a uniform consumerist whole. At the same time, the cultural landscape of the past five decades is littered with the bones of more or less unforced manifestations of popular taste. Practically any musical movement of the last 40 years, for example, can be traced back to a crucible far beneath the mass-cultural assembly line. The early 60s beat boom, and by extension the Beatles, began with merchant seamen bringing back obscure American rhythm 'n' blues records back to Merseyside. \"Mod\" started life in a handful of west London pubs, just as a dozen years later punk rock crawled off the streets of London and Manchester, and a dozen years after that the popularity of a new kind of dance music and the availability of a new kind of recreational drug combined to produce Acid House. The essential element of these movements was that no one - no music press journalist or marketing baron - had foreseen them. They had simply taken root somewhere in the subculture before growing to the point where the media was prepared to take an interest. It hardly needs saying, of course, that \"media interest\" nearly always means an immediate expropriation and assimilation by the mass culture. But very occasionally, a genuinely \"popular\" phenomenon manages to survive and prosper beyond the constricting net of the mass culture and the mass audience. A good example from the world of music might be the \"Northern Soul\" movement of the 60s and 70s. Centred on the famous Wigan Casino and various other up-country venues, based on rosters of little-known records imported from the States, it inspired a fanatical following of weekending dancers and its own patterns and rituals, without ever finding the wider commercial interest to extend it beyond its original base. Elsewhere, if any of the threads of the genuine \"popular culture\" whose disappearance Hoggart was regretting 40 years ago still exist, they do so far out of sight, deep down on the factory floor or the street corner - in hobbies and small-scale activities that the tabloid newspapers and television have never approached. Oddly enough, out beyond the cultural horse collar of the M25, there are still substantial numbers of people taking part in Cumberland wrestling, pigeon racing, caged-bird fancying and whippet-rearing. Such things go unreported and unexploited by the mass media merely because there is no money in them, but they are there. Even a car boot sale, that odd 80s version of the street market, represents \"popular culture\" at work at the most basic level: something self-creating and with its own private ordinances. Richard Hoggart would probably be appalled to think that the, undoubtedly limited, but also warm and comfortable working-class world he described in The Uses of Literacy should come to rest in a semi-circle of hucksters selling counterfeit videos from the backs of cars. But given the ravages that mass culture has wrought on our national life in the past half-century, even this is a survival of a sort.",

      "body": "<b>Phillip Horne: Yes</b> <br> <p>What is \"global culture\"? Three quarters of a century ago \"global\" was a mathematical term meaning spherical. The terms \"globalisation\", \"globality\" or \"global culture\" would have conveyed little more than \"oblong culture\" or \"trapezoid culture\".</p> <p> Not that \"globe\" itself lacked metaphorical bite. Shakespeare had shown the potential for poetical spin on the word in The Tempest, where Prospero says the masque-vision he has magically conjured must fade away, just as \"the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve\". And in A Midsummer Night's Dream, the fairy king Oberon, reconciled to Titania, promises her that \"We the globe can compass soon/ Swifter than the wand'ring moon.\" In fact, Shakespeare's Hamlet had also used the word, promising to remember his dead father \"While memory holds a seat/ In this distracted globe\" - making his head a world, as troubled heroes have done right down to The Matrix.</p> <p> When we think of a globe it is usually a miniature model of the earth, which one finger can send into violent revolution. If we dwell on that aspect, the tag \"global culture\" ominously hints at a terrible, dizzying shrinkage, at the mercy of some external hand (eg Disney, Murdoch, Coca-Cola). The more obvious implication, of course, is that \"global culture\" is something vast, a giant structure existing beyond any of us no matter how cosmopolitan our personal horizons. Neither way does \"global culture\" seem to belong to medium-sized human beings with a local habitation and a name. But then are we really supposed to feel good about it? Perhaps it is often meant sarcastically - as an oxymoron indeed - as if to say, \"What kind of roots could a culture like that grow?\" </p> <p> Or, if we follow the modern tendency to use the word \"culture\" as a neutral term of anthropological description rather than positive endorsement, \"global culture\" might simply name the artistic and other non-essential phenomena (like fashion) commonly consumed in most of the countries of the world. If this means shopping in an airport mall for a hard copy of Stephen King, Independence Day on DVD and Nike footwear, we are a long way indeed from Matthew Arnold's definition of culture in 1876 as \"the acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known and said in the world\". We might be tempted to offer some sourly updated formula to fit the global culture of the 21st century, like \"the acquiring for ourselves the best-advertised that is being made and sold in the world\".</p> <p> The emerging order certainly offers some opportunities for the Arnoldians among us: Internet shopping, for example, and the practice of multi-language subtitling on DVD, promises that we will be able to follow the oeuvres of foreign film-makers without being dependent on the whims of UK distributors. The Internet also allows British readers to explore a world of books in English (and, if we're equipped, \"in foreign\") not published in this country. New broader markets create newly profitable constituencies for minority interests. But such openings for a personal culture - for self-improvement - are side-roads off the information highway, permitted accidents of a system commercially geared to maximise corporate profit by maximising transactions.</p> <p>A decade or two ago, one used to think an \"entertainment empire\" was an incidental, if highly profitable, aspect of serious political power and control. Now big corporations wield more power than national governments, and it is in their interest to make the world safe for shopping by promoting a pseudo-democratic \"culture\" where obedient workers obtain their rewards by consuming movies, TV, music, fashions, cigarettes and foods, and by making other \"lifestyle\" expenditures. \"Rebellion\" is part of the package of associated values offered with every purchase, but mostly within what would in the 70s have been called \"the system\", in the form of the rock star's circumscribed individual bravado rather than political or social protest. </p> <p> Yet it is likely that sooner or later there will be some form of more organised resistance to these new kinds of imperialism. In fact some of the most conspicuous recent mainstream Hollywood movies themselves seem to smuggle in a measure of ironic criticism of the processes by which they are made and purveyed. The Richard Gere thriller Red Corner (1998) was about Western media corporations moving into the huge, corrupt new market of Communist China, and its lawyer-hero ends by rejecting his work for a US corporation and telling the US embassy to \"Go to hell\". The Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) had Jonathan Pryce as its villain, a Murdoch-like conspirator for world media domination. The Truman Show (1998) and The Matrix (1999), like Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall a few years back, are allegories of false consciousness, whose heroes are called to wake up to the illusoriness of the constructed world they only seem to inhabit, and, somehow, to dissolve it and break out.</p> <p> Furthermore, it does not seem that the main reason for Hollywood's return to the Roman Empire as a subject in Ridley Scott's Gladiator is that CGI technology now allows one to fill in the missing bits of the Coliseum and crowd it with cheap digitally rendered extras. The sprawling, ethnically diverse Roman world the film presents holds many parallels with the US empire of today. In particular, its genuine traditions of representative government have given way to crazed despotism and the bloody mass-entertainment displays of the gladiatorial ring. </p> <p>It is surely no coincidence that one of Gladiator's writers, John Logan, also wrote Oliver Stone's thuggish football movie Any Given Sunday. Both films, themselves crowd-pleasing spectacles of violence, offer a consciously wishful fantasy-ending in which the battered hero remembers the authentic values which have become degraded. He then heroically re-establishes them in the very arena where the corrupt regime - for Stone, it is television - most potently displays its power. The edge of desperation in all these films suggests the traumatic, trapped condition of the citizen of today's world, who has nowhere else to go and for whom the globe is like the bubble that repeatedly and inescapably swallows up Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner (a source, surely, for The Truman Show). And it is all too plausible to see the films themselves as swallowed up by the system they may be trying to criticise, reinserted into the industry of human interest and indiscriminate sensation (the \"culture\") that helps to distract the people of the globe from realising how they stand. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Phillip Horne</b> is Professor of English Literature at University College London.

First: Anthony Burgess begins You've Had Your Time, the second volume of his autobiography, with an anecdote about being convinced he was going to die during a trip to America; \"I was revived\", he says, \"with quarts of chill Coca-Cola, against which let no man say a word.\"</p> <p> Second observation: an American film based on a true story, about the capture of a German U-Boat during the second world war, is released in this country. To our great consternation, the nationality of the capturers has been changed from British to American. This, we feel, is a tampering with the historical record which cannot be condoned. The common ground for disdain here is America. It is the source of all that vulgarly affronts and afflicts the high, doomed culture of Europe. And \"vulgar\" is the word: America is for the crowd in the movie house, and not the scholar in the garret. Who are these idiotic Trimalchios, these moneyed yahoos to whom we are so powerfully drawn?</p> <p> In The Loved One, Evelyn Waugh described the contents of the averagely educated American's mind as the kind of sparse furniture one barked one's shins against in an otherwise empty room. His hero, the English expatriate poet Dennis Barlow, woos Aim\u00e9e Thanatogenos, the funeral parlour beautician, by quoting the most famously anthologised English poems and allowing her to think that he has written them himself. When she went to university she studied \"Beauticraft\".</p> <p> Saul Bellow coined the term \"the moronic inferno\" to describe his country; the less highbrow American film critic Joe Queenan pointed out in his book America that \"this society was dominated by the likes of William Shatner, not William Shakespeare\". But there is something unconvincing about this view, something about it that doesn't quite hold up to close scrutiny. American culture is built on quantities: on mass reproduction and consumption, on filling a vast space with a homogenous unity. To compare European and American is not to compare like with like. McDonald's boasts that its burgers taste identical all over the globe; Andy Warhol pointed out that the President's Coke tasted the same as the bum on the street's Coke, and no amount of power or wealth would buy the President a better Coke than the bum. Similarly, the great gift of America to the cultural universe, the Hollywood movie, has, by and large, been the product of rigidly-determined principles, guidelines and codes since its very inception.</p> <p> Yet Hollywood has taken over the world. And when the world is overrun without a shot having had to be fired, then you can be sure that the world wanted to be conquered. For the great point about American culture is that it forces one to take a side, pro- or anti-, on the issue of democracy. If you don't like American culture you had better ask yourself what it is you are precisely objecting to, and an honest answer to that is often an uncomfortable one. To compare European Keats with American Dylan is a category error; and why not, while we are at it, compare American Henry James with European Donovan? The idea of us as the cultivated Greeks, to the Americans' barbaric but powerful Romans, can no longer be meaningfully sustained, and, to be fair, no one really tries any more, or hedges the argument about so carefully as to be more apology than argument. One may mock the American university, but that is the one which will buy your correspondence when you die.</p> <p>But the U-Boat film remains a problem for many. The Americans' very cavalier treatment of the historical record is the issue. But I put it that we are not focusing on it in the right way. For the historical victor, history is malleable. And the question is not so much why the Americans rewrote history, as this: why we did not have the money, the energy, or the inspiration to make our own film about the event ourselves. If that is how we guard our heritage, ie \"bleating about it long after the event\", then we deserve to be written out of it.</p> <p>\u0095 Nicholas Lezard is writing a book about the history and practice of fun, to be published by Faber and Faber</p>",

The last 10 years in particular have seen a swingeing rationalisation of the British publishing industry, with the larger, long-established houses incorporated into multinational conglomerates, editors placed under increasing pressure to maintain a healthy bottom line, and the unprecedented rise of the marketing campaign. Were Kafka's Metamorphosis to arrive on a literary editor's desk today, it would probably be accompanied by details of its author's readings at Waterstone's and a promotional gimmick in the shape of a can of Vapona fly spray; the publicity-shy author has become publishers' biggest headache.</p> <p>Cultural pessimists could certainly argue for a decline in the quality and scope of the British novel, its limited aims and achievements dwarfed by the scale and diversity of its counterparts from America and the rest of the world. Such a damning judgment would be false, as brilliantly original and inventive novels continue to be written. It's not just about the collapsing of any dubious distinction between mass and literary fiction (as the jackets on this page show - that began long ago); the problem is that the difficult and the innovative are finding it harder than ever to fight their corner.</p>",

The last 10 years in particular have seen a swingeing rationalisation of the British publishing industry, with the larger, long-established houses incorporated into multinational conglomerates, editors placed under increasing pressure to maintain a healthy bottom line, and the unprecedented rise of the marketing campaign. Were Kafka's Metamorphosis to arrive on a literary editor's desk today, it would probably be accompanied by details of its author's readings at Waterstone's and a promotional gimmick in the shape of a can of Vapona fly spray; the publicity-shy author has become publishers' biggest headache. Cultural pessimists could certainly argue for a decline in the quality and scope of the British novel, its limited aims and achievements dwarfed by the scale and diversity of its counterparts from America and the rest of the world. Such a damning judgment would be false, as brilliantly original and inventive novels continue to be written. It's not just about the collapsing of any dubious distinction between mass and literary fiction (as the jackets on this page show - that began long ago); the problem is that the difficult and the innovative are finding it harder than ever to fight their corner.",

It said yesterday it is to pay \u00a329.4m for Crisp Computing, a business software group. </p> <p>As recently as September this year, Moneyextra chief executive Paul Lindsey said: \"We are well positioned to exploit the continued growth in the market for online personal financial services,\" and that heavy investment in the first half of the year would be rewarded in the second half. </p> <p>But yesterday he said competition from financial institutions combining telephone and branch-based advice with web delivery had made the market for independent websites difficult. </p> <p>\"'Clicks only' has not worked. We are beginning to see that for more complex financial products people need advice, which means integrating a site such as Moneyextra.com into call centres and so on,\" said Mr Lindsey. </p> <p>He said the amount of investment required to meet such demands \"has reduced the attractiveness of the business to consumer opportunity.\" Moneyextra raised \u00a390m in cash from the float last year, but more than \u00a350m has been swallowed up in investments in the site, advertising and acquisitions. </p> <p>In October 1999 it paid \u00a36m in cash for Moneyworld.com, followed by largely share-financed takeovers in Europe. </p> <p>In February it reported an operating loss of \u00a318m on turnover of \u00a314m, but said it would press ahead with increased investment in the consumer market, including an \u00a318m advertising campaign. </p> <p>But five months later it gave the first warnings that transaction-based revenues were falling short of expectations. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.moneyextra.com\">www.moneyextra.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Moneyextra.com, the personal finance website that was the crucial part of a \u00a3400m flotation last year was yesterday sold for \u00a326m as its holding company quit the business to consumer marketplace. When Moneyextra's parent group, Exchange Holdings, floated in August last year it was 17 times oversubscribed, and subsequently embarked on an acquisitions spree to build a Europe-wide personal finance transactions portal. It renamed itself Moneyextra.com and at one point its shares hit 425p, valuing the firm at more than \u00a3900m. But yesterday, with its shares trading at just 33.5p, it admitted that transaction activity was lower than anticipated and said the future for standalone business to consumer finance websites was bleak. The site is being sold to Bristol &amp; West, a subsidiary of Bank of Ireland, which says it intends to invest \u00a314m in developing the business as a \"bricks and clicks\" rather than \"clicks only\" website. The sale of Moneyextra.com means the group will return to its former name, Exchange, and focus on business to business activities. It said yesterday it is to pay \u00a329.4m for Crisp Computing, a business software group. As recently as September this year, Moneyextra chief executive Paul Lindsey said: \"We are well positioned to exploit the continued growth in the market for online personal financial services,\" and that heavy investment in the first half of the year would be rewarded in the second half. But yesterday he said competition from financial institutions combining telephone and branch-based advice with web delivery had made the market for independent websites difficult. \"'Clicks only' has not worked. We are beginning to see that for more complex financial products people need advice, which means integrating a site such as Moneyextra.com into call centres and so on,\" said Mr Lindsey. He said the amount of investment required to meet such demands \"has reduced the attractiveness of the business to consumer opportunity.\" Moneyextra raised \u00a390m in cash from the float last year, but more than \u00a350m has been swallowed up in investments in the site, advertising and acquisitions. In October 1999 it paid \u00a36m in cash for Moneyworld.com, followed by largely share-financed takeovers in Europe. In February it reported an operating loss of \u00a318m on turnover of \u00a314m, but said it would press ahead with increased investment in the consumer market, including an \u00a318m advertising campaign. But five months later it gave the first warnings that transaction-based revenues were falling short of expectations. www.moneyextra.com",

      "bodyText": "The supreme court in Zimbabwe ruled yesterday that the country's \"fast-track\" land resettlement programme is unconstitutional and ordered police to remove government supporters from more than 1,600 white-owned farms. The decision is a blow to President Robert Mugabe and his land redistribution scheme, which has seen Zimbabwe's most productive farms engulfed by violence and prevented from growing crops. The ruling states that if the government wishes to seize land, it must follow the procedures of the country's Land Acquisition Act, which gives owners the chance to contest farm seizures in court and at least 90 days to vacate their land. The court accused the government of promoting illegality and violence under the guise of land redistribution and called for police to stop the occupation of farms by war veterans and other Mugabe supporters. Until now the police have refused to remove the occupiers and have not protected owners from violence. The government had not responded to the ruling by last night.",

If you want simple, head 70 miles south of here to Cuba - their elections are always very simple and very clear.\"</p> <p>So America has not been exposed as a banana republic this week. If that were true, Jeb Bush would have done a better job of rigging the Florida contest for his brother - or Bill Clinton would have declared a state of emergency and made himself president-for-life (I bet the thought has crossed his mind). Instead the country has a functioning government, with Clinton in place for three more months and a procedure to follow.

If it was just a matter of winning the most votes in the country, Al Gore would be president-elect by now, albeit by the narrowest of edges. Instead, the candidates have to put together a jigsaw puzzle of states, bagging their votes in the electoral college.</p> <p>That idea is not all bad in itself: indeed, it prevents candidates lavishing all their attention on heavily populated areas like New York and California, forcing them instead to listen to the smaller states. In a federal country, that's essential. No, the problem is not with the electoral college itself so much as the way it operates.</p> <p>The reason why Gore and George W Bush are locked in a death match in Florida is that only one of them can win the state's 25 electoral college votes: it's winner-takes-all. What's to stop Florida giving 12 votes to one candidate, 13 to the other? Nothing. Florida could do it, just as Maine and Nebraska already do. If the other 47 states went the same way, allocating their votes proportionally, the electoral college vote would reflect the popular one - and still give clout to the smaller states. Yet Americans would tremble before taking that simple step.</p> <p>Or consider the now notorious ballot paper in Florida's Palm Beach County, the one that required laser-beam eyesight and a knack for logic puzzles. Why did that county have that weird ballot paper? How come they're not all the same, if not across America then at least in Florida? The answer is that same, conservative attachment to the old way of doing things.</p> <p>Americans are militant about preserving the rights of individual states to resist the standardising instincts of the centre - just as they were when they built the country 224 years ago and fought a civil war a century later. They are still radical devolutionists, who believe each area should always be able to go its own way: even if that means Palm Beach county having its very own ballot paper.</p> <p>There is a pattern here. Rules devised for a very different era - the late 18th century - are obeyed to this day as if they were religious edicts. The electoral college grew out of an 18th-century fear of the undiluted popular will, preferring the deliberations of wise men to the instincts of the masses - yet today's 21st-century Americans fear altering it even by one jot. The principle of states' rights was a reaction against the centralising rule of George III - yet modern America clings to that principle two centuries after the British have gone, even when it leads to a patchwork of wildly different voting systems and electoral chaos.</p> <p>It's an odd trait for Americans, who we usually imagine as a people unshackled by history, the creators of a new world. Yet this nostalgic fear of change is very real. While Britain redesigns its bank notes every few years, the US dollar bill looks the same now as it always has. The same goes for the layout of America's leading newspapers: short of centuries of history, they cling to what they have.</p> <p>Politically this habit makes a big difference. For it chains Americans to a system that can be patently anachronistic. Writer Daniel Lazare has argued that America is \"the frozen republic\", paralysed by a constitution that is absurdly out of date. But one does not have to go that far. For the beauty of the constitution is that it contains within it the possibility of its own reform. It can be amended. Not on a whim, admittedly, but amended all the same. So when Americans wanted to ban alcohol, as they did in 1919, they could pass the 18th amendment. And when they wanted to unban it, as they did in 1933, they could pass the 21st. Americans are not paralysed by the constitution - only by their own fear of changing it.</p> <p>So they could modernise the electoral college or standardise voting (perhaps using computer software) if they wanted to. While they're at it, they could learn a few things from Britain - demanding, for example, that all postal ballots are in by election day and all votes counted before a result is declared. A simple idea that, but it does seem to work. They might also look at free TV advertising, like our party election broadcasts, removing the pressure to raise so much campaign cash.</p> <p>There is much America can learn from democracies around the world. But first it has to realise that, though the founding principles of the republic remain inspiring, not every cog and wheel of that 18th-century machinery is sacred. America needs to recall its revolutionary origins, to remember that it was built on change - and that it can change now.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Many have drawn from George W Bush's strong, if now ambiguous, showing in the US poll an electoral warning for our own Clinton-clone, Tony Blair. They point out that politics tends to echo across the Atlantic: from the ideological twinning of Reagan/Thatcher and Clinton/Blair to the odd historical footnote that both nations were run during 1976 by unelected leaders: Ford and Callaghan.</p> <p>But there is another, disturbing, parallel between Britain and the US. During the final quarter of the year 2000, both have experienced democratic gridlock. The fuel dispute created by the farmers and truckers briefly threatened the UK with standstill and anarchy. A few Floridian incompetents or revolutionaries have now achieved the same effect in America. In both cases, there is a presumption that electoral decisions can be adjusted to suit a perception of a greater good.</p> <p>The practical circumstances are different. Although many have questioned the direction of the Blair administration, its democratic legitimacy is beyond challenge. No Sussex retirees claimed to have been bewildered into voting for him by a Picasso-like ballot paper, nor did Brixton electors report being turned away from the polling station.</p> <p>And yet the growing complaint that the electoral system leaves large groups of voters disenfranchised threatens the seats of power in both Washington and London. In truth, divisiveness has always been a fault of democracy - in rewarding the majority, a disgruntled residue must be left. The difference is that what William Hague called \"fine upstanding citizens\" are now prepared to do something about it. British rural communities take to the motorways; US pensioners challenge the ballot through the courts.</p> <p>The threat of a standstill Britain seems to have been averted at least for the moment by Gordon Brown's subtle buy-off of enough of the disgruntled in Wednesday's pre-budget statement. America's power stasis - and the question of which president will be shaking hands with Brown and Blair from next January - cannot be so easily settled. There is now no procedure in Florida - recount, restaging, supreme court intervention - which could deliver a president acceptable to even half the country. Gore, though, might be the marginally less compromised, if only because none of his family was involved in the count.</p> <p>As politicians often point out, perception is more important than reality. And, though Governor Jeb Bush of Florida doubtless treated both candidates as brothers in his supervision of the poll, history might at the very least squint at the idea that a candidate had been given a cigarette-paper victory by the results from a state run by his sibling.</p> <p>There is something of Greek drama in the way that the Bush family has its apparent political triumphs undermined. In late 1991, Big George was a war-winning president with huge approval ratings, seemingly certain of a second term. But the people replaced him one year later with a draft-dodger. Now Little George may be allowed only 84 minutes of unchallenged presidential victory on election night before settling for being a lame-duck from day one. The egalitarian US is unkind to its political dynasties. Kennedys get killed; Bushes are humiliated.</p> <p>A Gore restoration in America would set a terrifying precedent: lawyers would replace spin doctors as a losing candidate's best friend. There's a rule in football that, while television replay evidence can lead to the after-match disciplining of players, it can never be used to over-turn a result. Even if the cameras prove that the ball bounced down behind the goal-line, the unlucky team's score will never be increased. Without this, no cup would ever be awarded because of impending court actions.</p> <p>How much more might this rule apply to elections. The last three US presidents - Reagan, Bush senior, Clinton - have faced legal attempts to remove them from office. It's merely an acceleration of the trend that lawyers should now be involved in intercepting one on the way to the Oval Office door.</p> <p>But there's an old saying that we get the leaders we deserve. If so, it would be appropriate for America to be run by a president without a mandate: either Gore forced in by the courts or Bush chosen by the electoral college despite losing the popular vote. An electorate in which at least half of the enfranchised decline to vote (and many who do participate no longer believe in the system) deserves to be represented by an illegitimate president.</p> <p>Throughout the 90s, a constant theme of pundits was the growing contempt of the electorate towards politicians. We were right about this but wrong about the form it would take. Rather than the anticipated apathy, the rejection of democratic tradition has been manifested by activism and practical or legal attempts to change the nature of the leadership.</p> <p>Even without the row over the Florida poll, the dead heat elsewhere in America is a perfect reflection of what most voters think about politics. We'd tended to assume that the popular moan that \"they're just as bad as each other\" would result in non-voting and low turnouts. But, in this poll, the American people have managed to make the point by voting.</p> <p>Contact: <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",

They point out that politics tends to echo across the Atlantic: from the ideological twinning of Reagan/Thatcher and Clinton/Blair to the odd historical footnote that both nations were run during 1976 by unelected leaders: Ford and Callaghan. But there is another, disturbing, parallel between Britain and the US. During the final quarter of the year 2000, both have experienced democratic gridlock. The fuel dispute created by the farmers and truckers briefly threatened the UK with standstill and anarchy. A few Floridian incompetents or revolutionaries have now achieved the same effect in America. In both cases, there is a presumption that electoral decisions can be adjusted to suit a perception of a greater good. The practical circumstances are different. Although many have questioned the direction of the Blair administration, its democratic legitimacy is beyond challenge. No Sussex retirees claimed to have been bewildered into voting for him by a Picasso-like ballot paper, nor did Brixton electors report being turned away from the polling station. And yet the growing complaint that the electoral system leaves large groups of voters disenfranchised threatens the seats of power in both Washington and London. In truth, divisiveness has always been a fault of democracy - in rewarding the majority, a disgruntled residue must be left. The difference is that what William Hague called \"fine upstanding citizens\" are now prepared to do something about it. British rural communities take to the motorways; US pensioners challenge the ballot through the courts. The threat of a standstill Britain seems to have been averted at least for the moment by Gordon Brown's subtle buy-off of enough of the disgruntled in Wednesday's pre-budget statement. America's power stasis - and the question of which president will be shaking hands with Brown and Blair from next January - cannot be so easily settled. There is now no procedure in Florida - recount, restaging, supreme court intervention - which could deliver a president acceptable to even half the country. Gore, though, might be the marginally less compromised, if only because none of his family was involved in the count. As politicians often point out, perception is more important than reality. And, though Governor Jeb Bush of Florida doubtless treated both candidates as brothers in his supervision of the poll, history might at the very least squint at the idea that a candidate had been given a cigarette-paper victory by the results from a state run by his sibling. There is something of Greek drama in the way that the Bush family has its apparent political triumphs undermined. In late 1991, Big George was a war-winning president with huge approval ratings, seemingly certain of a second term. But the people replaced him one year later with a draft-dodger. Now Little George may be allowed only 84 minutes of unchallenged presidential victory on election night before settling for being a lame-duck from day one. The egalitarian US is unkind to its political dynasties. Kennedys get killed; Bushes are humiliated. A Gore restoration in America would set a terrifying precedent: lawyers would replace spin doctors as a losing candidate's best friend. There's a rule in football that, while television replay evidence can lead to the after-match disciplining of players, it can never be used to over-turn a result. Even if the cameras prove that the ball bounced down behind the goal-line, the unlucky team's score will never be increased. Without this, no cup would ever be awarded because of impending court actions. How much more might this rule apply to elections. The last three US presidents - Reagan, Bush senior, Clinton - have faced legal attempts to remove them from office. It's merely an acceleration of the trend that lawyers should now be involved in intercepting one on the way to the Oval Office door. But there's an old saying that we get the leaders we deserve. If so, it would be appropriate for America to be run by a president without a mandate: either Gore forced in by the courts or Bush chosen by the electoral college despite losing the popular vote. An electorate in which at least half of the enfranchised decline to vote (and many who do participate no longer believe in the system) deserves to be represented by an illegitimate president. Throughout the 90s, a constant theme of pundits was the growing contempt of the electorate towards politicians. We were right about this but wrong about the form it would take. Rather than the anticipated apathy, the rejection of democratic tradition has been manifested by activism and practical or legal attempts to change the nature of the leadership. Even without the row over the Florida poll, the dead heat elsewhere in America is a perfect reflection of what most voters think about politics. We'd tended to assume that the popular moan that \"they're just as bad as each other\" would result in non-voting and low turnouts. But, in this poll, the American people have managed to make the point by voting. Contact: comment@theguardian.com.",

      "bodyText": "EMI, the music group behind the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams, yesterday confirmed that German rival Bertelsmann had made an approach which could led to a \"combination\" of their recording businesses. The overture was made after EMI's planned \u00a314bn merger with Warner Music faltered last month. The pair withdrew their plans as it became clear the European commission was preparing to block the deal. Bertelsmann under Thomas Middelhoff, its ambitious chief executive, has long been seen as a possible suitor for EMI. Mr Middelhoff said at the beginning of the year he expected his music business, BMG, to become the world's largest by the end of 2000. There was some speculation that Bertelsmann was aiming to inject BMG into EMI in return for a stake in the enlarged group which would remain listed in London. The theory seemed to be supported by a brief statement from EMI which said the approach did not constitute an offer for the company, although it cautioned that detailed talks had not yet taken place. The approach is not believed to be hostile. Bertelsmann insiders said they were confident that a deal could get past Brussels and hinted that an informal approach had already been made to the competition authorities. A combined EMI-BMG would have a similar market share to EMI-Warner but is less dominant in music publishing, and would not raise the same concerns over Time Warner's merger with AOL. BMG's artists include Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and Whitney Houston. EMI - which was the Beatles' record label - and Warner are hoping to return to Brussels with a redrawn plan but the intervention of a third party was widely anticipated. Some reports, however, have have cast doubt on whether EMI and Warner Music, owned by Time Warner in the US, would continue to try to hammer out a deal the regulators would accept. Shares in EMI initially flew upwards on the announcement but settled back 27.5p higher at 571.5p at the prospect of a nil-premium deal. Warner Music and EMI have an agreed period of exclusivity which prevents either seeking alternative buyers before the end of January 2001. But that does not stop EMI discussing a deal with Bertelsmann, as the German company made the approach. Management changes at BMG which earlier this week which saw the departure of Michael Dornemann, the chairman, and Strauss Zelnick, president and chief executive of BMG Entertainment, could make a merger of the two less problematic. Mr Middelhoff recently broke ranks with the other large recording businesses by agreeing a deal to legitimise the controversial online music site Napster - which would include Bertelsmann taking a stake in the operation. Some analysts suggested the Bertelsmann approach could also work in EMI's favour by ensuring that Warner Music does not try to screw better terms out of the company. EMI and Warner Music came close to agreeing a compromise with the EC by offering to divest substantial parts of their businesses - including Virgin Records and Chapell Music. The EC said the last-minute informal offers had substantially improved the chances of approval but added that it still had doubts and did not have time for a proper evaluation of the new concessions. EMI and Warner Music withdrew their bid from the table at the start of last month to avoid an official veto from Brussels that would have prevented them returning with a reworked bid.",

      "bodyText": "If Gordon Brown wants to know why under the white coat of every nerdy scientist in America beats the heart of an adventure capitalist, the chancellor should spend some time in the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California San Francisco. At the $75m glass and beige brick facility teams of scientists work in large laboratories with the latest equipment and generous budgets on reducing the incidence of cancer. The surrounding Bay Area is home to three of the world's leading bio-science research universities, 645 biotech companies and their 80,200 workers. UCSF's most notable spin-off is Genentech, the $44bn New York-listed biotech firm. It was established in 1976 when Professor Herbert Boyer, a geneticist, teamed up with Robert Swanson, a partner at venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins, to commercialise his research. Yet for all the pride about \"local excellence,\" the coffee machine chatter is as much about Celtic or Chelsea as the Giants and the 49ers, and the accents are British as often as they are Californian. A quarter of the 24 labs are run by British professors and many of the brightest post-doctoral researchers who staff them trained in Cambridge, London or Glasgow. The presence of so many Brits has led to fevered debate in the UK science establishment about a \"brain drain\".

      "body": "<p>What has happened to Wal-Mart's messianic vision of building ugly metal sheds to sell bargain bucket products throughout Britain's green and pleasant land? </p> <p>The hugely successful American retailing chain had big plans to overwhelm Tesco and Sainsbury when it bought Asda for \u00a36.7bn last year. But a trickle of high profile departures seems to suggest the dream is proving difficult to realise. </p> <p>Asda's long serving chief executive, Allan Leighton, left two months ago and his deputy, 51-year-old Tony Campbell, announced plans to retire shortly afterwards. They were followed this week by George Davies - founder of the chain's widely acclaimed George clothes brand, which was the first serious attempt at genuine fashion in supermarkets. </p> <p>With former chairman Archie Norman now applying his talents to the Conservative front bench, few of the architects of Asda's 1990s success remain. That success was based on flair - innovative products, \"happy to help\" badges and quirky advertising. Industry sources suggest Asda's senior ranks are becoming disillusioned with their American parent company's starry-eyed focus on price. </p> <p>Retail research firm Verdict points out that the British consumer is more sophisticated than most, ranking range and convenience as higher priorities than value. Many say that quality and ambience are crucial in their choice of where to shop. </p> <p>Wal-Mart is already struggling to impose its retailing philosophy on Germany, where staff are said to hide in the toilet each morning to escape the compulsory Wal-Mart chant - give us a W... give us an A... The company is beginning to appear frustrated over here - trading this year has been disappointing and there is so far only one Asda Wal-Mart superstore. The aim of 10 to 12 hypermarkets seems a long way off, particularly since the government is proving reluctant to approve the construction of any more monuments to consumerism in the countryside. </p> <p><strong> Net hubris </strong><br> </p> <p> Keen observers of net hubris will welcome the humbling of Moneyextra.com, sold off yesterday for less than a tenth of the value ascribed to it during the dot.com madness of March. More evidence, it appears, that e-commerce is failing to deliver its promises. </p> <p>But it is easy to draw the wrong conclusion. Earlier this week Ryanair reported that 60% of its flight bookings are now online, a massive increase on last year, and the reason for a continuing fall in costs. Financial products were widely believed to be ideally suited to internet delivery. So why have sites like Moneyextra.com failed to deliver? </p> <p>It is now emerging that only certain types of financial products will work on the net.

      "bodyText": "What has happened to Wal-Mart's messianic vision of building ugly metal sheds to sell bargain bucket products throughout Britain's green and pleasant land? The hugely successful American retailing chain had big plans to overwhelm Tesco and Sainsbury when it bought Asda for \u00a36.7bn last year. But a trickle of high profile departures seems to suggest the dream is proving difficult to realise. Asda's long serving chief executive, Allan Leighton, left two months ago and his deputy, 51-year-old Tony Campbell, announced plans to retire shortly afterwards. They were followed this week by George Davies - founder of the chain's widely acclaimed George clothes brand, which was the first serious attempt at genuine fashion in supermarkets. With former chairman Archie Norman now applying his talents to the Conservative front bench, few of the architects of Asda's 1990s success remain. That success was based on flair - innovative products, \"happy to help\" badges and quirky advertising. Industry sources suggest Asda's senior ranks are becoming disillusioned with their American parent company's starry-eyed focus on price. Retail research firm Verdict points out that the British consumer is more sophisticated than most, ranking range and convenience as higher priorities than value. Many say that quality and ambience are crucial in their choice of where to shop. Wal-Mart is already struggling to impose its retailing philosophy on Germany, where staff are said to hide in the toilet each morning to escape the compulsory Wal-Mart chant - give us a W... give us an A... The company is beginning to appear frustrated over here - trading this year has been disappointing and there is so far only one Asda Wal-Mart superstore. The aim of 10 to 12 hypermarkets seems a long way off, particularly since the government is proving reluctant to approve the construction of any more monuments to consumerism in the countryside. Net hubris Keen observers of net hubris will welcome the humbling of Moneyextra.com, sold off yesterday for less than a tenth of the value ascribed to it during the dot.com madness of March. More evidence, it appears, that e-commerce is failing to deliver its promises. But it is easy to draw the wrong conclusion. Earlier this week Ryanair reported that 60% of its flight bookings are now online, a massive increase on last year, and the reason for a continuing fall in costs. Financial products were widely believed to be ideally suited to internet delivery. So why have sites like Moneyextra.com failed to deliver? It is now emerging that only certain types of financial products will work on the net. Car insurance works - it is a simple, annual policy where comparative quotes were the norm even before the advent of the net. But it will be a very long time before mortgage and pension buying reaches the level of car insurance. There is a clear, and very understandable, resistance to buying complex financial products online. Independent financial websites face the Herculean task of trying to match the face to face advice banks offer in branches or over the phone. Yesterday some sites were scoffing at Moneyextra's embarrassment, but it is hard to see where their future, and other independents such as iii.com, hemscott.net and motleyfool.com, lies if they follow a \"clicks only\" strategy. Moneyextra's sale to Bristol &amp; West is evidence that the clicks badly need the big bricks to survive. Vertical tuning When EMI announced its merger with Warner Music, investors gave the deal a lukewarm reception. As time went on, however, shareholders begun to grudgingly accept the cold logic of the nil-premium deal which would produce the world's largest music company and achieve savings of some \u00a3250m a year.

      "body": "<p><strong> Matalan </strong> , wunderkind of the retailing scene, could soon claim the corporate accolade - membership of the FTSE 100. </p> <p>With less than a month to go until the next reshuffle of the FTSE indexes, the discount clothing retailer is Britain's 98th-largest company. While this does not guarantee automatic promotion to the big time, odds are Matalan will still make it. </p> <p>Based on Friday's closing prices, four blue chips - Baltimore, Bookham, Emap and P&amp;O Princess Cruises - will automatically drop out of the index at the review. Their places will have to be taken by the biggest companies in the FTSE 250, of which Matalan, by a quite some distance, is one. </p> <p>According to dealers the sharp rise in Matalan's share price this week - it opened on at 747p on Monday and closed last night at 774p - owes a lot to the speculation about its inclusion; despite yesterday's 26p fall the gains look set to continue. </p> <p>Dealers reckon the large stake controlled by the family of chairman John Hargreaves is going to make it hard for index trackers to get hold of enough stock to build an appropriate weighting. At least one broker - said to be Salomon Smith Barney - reckons the shares could run well beyond 800p in the next few weeks. </p> <p>Retailers as a whole had a good day with investors moving out of \"new economy\" stocks into more defensive areas of the market as the uncertainty over the US presidential election continued. High street chemist <strong> Boots</strong> rose 45p to 575p, electrical retailer <strong> Dixons </strong> added 17p to 229p and home shopping outfit <strong> GUS</strong> gained 23.5p to 520.5p. </p> <p>Other defensive issues to find favour included <strong> BG</strong>, up 13p to 276p, <strong> Tesco</strong>, 9.5p better at 277.75p, and <strong> Unilever</strong>, up 15p to 551p. Even <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, 10.5p higher at 202.5p, was in demand although this probably had more to do with a late rumour of a possible bid for the group from French retailer Pinault Printemps Redoute - last mentioned as a bidder for <strong> Kingfisher</strong>, also higher, up 9p to 441p. </p> <p>After falling nearly 100 points shortly after Wall Street opened for business, leading shares managed to recover their poise late in the day and the FTSE 100 closed down only 42 points at 6,400.2. The FTSE 250 fell 51.8 to 6,736.2 and the Techmark 100 ended 124 adrift at 3,222.48.</p> <p>Most of the downside came courtesy of a weakness in the technology and telecoms sectors, something not entirely surprising given that computer maker Dell issued what amounted to a profits warning. </p> <p>According to dealers there was not a buyer to be found for the likes of <strong> Bookham Technology</strong>. Even though the optical components maker issued a statement which effectively said everything was fine, its shares still fell 266p to \u00a315.60 - their lowest since flotation in April. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the tech world, <strong> Logica </strong> fell 145p to \u00a317.25p and <strong> Sema</strong> lost 63p to 770p. Things were no better for telecom stocks. <strong> Colt Telecom</strong> fell 121p to \u00a317.19p and <strong> BT </strong> lost 49p to 700p with investors still unimpressed by its radical restructuring plan. </p> <p>Yet for those prepared to trade there were a few stories knocking about. Building materials group <strong> Heywood Williams </strong> , up 5.5p at 164.5p, was again attracting some educated buying. Earlier this year Heywood was on the receiving end of a 300p-a-share bid from a venture capital consortium and, so the story goes, its current problems have rekindled the group's interest. Last week the company issued its second profits warning in three months and the feeling is that large shareholders no longer think it has a future as an independent company. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong> William Baird </strong> , the clothing supplier best know for trying to sue Marks &amp; Spencer, rose 2.5p to 59.5p on word that the company will soon go private.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Matalan , wunderkind of the retailing scene, could soon claim the corporate accolade - membership of the FTSE 100. With less than a month to go until the next reshuffle of the FTSE indexes, the discount clothing retailer is Britain's 98th-largest company. While this does not guarantee automatic promotion to the big time, odds are Matalan will still make it. Based on Friday's closing prices, four blue chips - Baltimore, Bookham, Emap and P&amp;O Princess Cruises - will automatically drop out of the index at the review. Their places will have to be taken by the biggest companies in the FTSE 250, of which Matalan, by a quite some distance, is one. According to dealers the sharp rise in Matalan's share price this week - it opened on at 747p on Monday and closed last night at 774p - owes a lot to the speculation about its inclusion; despite yesterday's 26p fall the gains look set to continue. Dealers reckon the large stake controlled by the family of chairman John Hargreaves is going to make it hard for index trackers to get hold of enough stock to build an appropriate weighting. At least one broker - said to be Salomon Smith Barney - reckons the shares could run well beyond 800p in the next few weeks. Retailers as a whole had a good day with investors moving out of \"new economy\" stocks into more defensive areas of the market as the uncertainty over the US presidential election continued. High street chemist Boots rose 45p to 575p, electrical retailer Dixons added 17p to 229p and home shopping outfit GUS gained 23.5p to 520.5p. Other defensive issues to find favour included BG, up 13p to 276p, Tesco, 9.5p better at 277.75p, and Unilever, up 15p to 551p. Even Marks &amp; Spencer, 10.5p higher at 202.5p, was in demand although this probably had more to do with a late rumour of a possible bid for the group from French retailer Pinault Printemps Redoute - last mentioned as a bidder for Kingfisher, also higher, up 9p to 441p. After falling nearly 100 points shortly after Wall Street opened for business, leading shares managed to recover their poise late in the day and the FTSE 100 closed down only 42 points at 6,400.2. The FTSE 250 fell 51.8 to 6,736.2 and the Techmark 100 ended 124 adrift at 3,222.48. Most of the downside came courtesy of a weakness in the technology and telecoms sectors, something not entirely surprising given that computer maker Dell issued what amounted to a profits warning. According to dealers there was not a buyer to be found for the likes of Bookham Technology. Even though the optical components maker issued a statement which effectively said everything was fine, its shares still fell 266p to \u00a315.60 - their lowest since flotation in April. Elsewhere in the tech world, Logica fell 145p to \u00a317.25p and Sema lost 63p to 770p. Things were no better for telecom stocks. Colt Telecom fell 121p to \u00a317.19p and BT lost 49p to 700p with investors still unimpressed by its radical restructuring plan. Yet for those prepared to trade there were a few stories knocking about. Building materials group Heywood Williams , up 5.5p at 164.5p, was again attracting some educated buying. Earlier this year Heywood was on the receiving end of a 300p-a-share bid from a venture capital consortium and, so the story goes, its current problems have rekindled the group's interest. Last week the company issued its second profits warning in three months and the feeling is that large shareholders no longer think it has a future as an independent company. Elsewhere, William Baird , the clothing supplier best know for trying to sue Marks &amp; Spencer, rose 2.5p to 59.5p on word that the company will soon go private.",

      "bodyText": "Football is on trial in Brazil as a high-profile inquiry threatens to expose the murky world behind the proudest symbol of the country's national identity. Two congressional investigations into football heard testimony this week about subjects ranging from the Brazil squad's contract with the clothing manufacturer Nike to match-fixing and corruption in player transfers. Pele and Ronaldo - World Cup stars past and present - are the best known names on a list that includes players, coaches, agents, club bosses and journalists who will be called to give evidence to the cross-party investigating committees. The hearings have caught the imagination of a public disillusioned with national football after a run of corruption scandals and embarrassing defeats. \"I think the [inquiries] are a good thing. They are of great public interest and [football] needs some morality,\" said the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Renata Alves, the former secretary of the recently sacked Brazil coach, Wanderley Luxemburgo, testified on Thursday that between 1993 and 1994 (before he was appointed Brazil coach in 1998) he used to leave weekly business meetings with a briefcase stuffed full of dollars from commissions from selling players. Ms Alves added that she saw well known club directors at these meetings and that their discussions included match-fixing. \"Football is one of the few sectors of our society where there is a black box waiting to be opened,\" said Senator Alvaro Dias, author of the inquiry in the upper house. The senate will look at issues including fake passports used by players sold to Europe, tax evasion by clubs and the role of players' agents. Nike deal Congressmen - who have stronger powers of investigation than the police - have been allowed access to the banking and telephone records of Brazil's 19 Fifa-registered football agents and the go-between for Nike and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The 10-year \u00a3300m Nike deal, which will be the focus of the inquiry in the house's lower chamber, is seen by many as an affront to Brazilian sovereignty since it gives the US company power to arrange a fixed number of friendly games. Supporters of the CBF say the deal should be applauded because it brought money to Brazilian football, although the precise destination of the funds has never been clear. Congressmen will also attempt to investigate one of the greatest conspiracy theories of modern football - whether Nike pressurised Brazil to field Ronaldo in the World Cup final in 1998 because he was part of its advertising campaign. This week the inquiry heard from Joao Havelange, who was president of world football's governing body, Fifa, for 24 years, and before that was head of the Brazilian federation. His questioners appeared surprised and irritated when Mr Havelange, who remains a highly influential figure in Brazilian football and whose former son-in-law is the current chairman of the CBF, said he had never read the Nike contract. Eurico Miranda, vice-chairman of Rio club Vasco da Gama, is also expected to be asked to give evidence. He has been linked to suspicions of irregularities in his club's business dealings, especially the sale of the World Cup star Bebeto to a Spanish club in 1992. Mr Miranda won a seat in congress, thanks mainly to the votes of Vasco fans. Elected officials are immune from prosecution. Self-respect Aldo Rebelo, presiding over the hearing, said that football \"integrates all the races that make up our country\". \"It is like a religion, and our players are like its apostles. It is our patrimony. But it has been treated just as a commodity. It cannot be reduced to this. This is the death of football. For the public interest it needs investigation.\" Mr Rebelo, of the Brazilian Communist party, said he hoped the effect of both hearings would go beyond the prosecution of individuals. \"The main purpose is to fight against the mentality of the market. We want to preserve football as a culture of entertainment and preserve the nation's self respect.\" Criticisms of the way football is run tend to be brushed under the carpet when the squad is doing well. But the last few months have seen humiliating defeats against Paraguay and Chile in qualifying games for the 2002 World Cup - only the second and third time Brazil has ever lost a game at the preliminary stages - and against South Africa and Cameroon at the Sydney Olympics. The poor results claimed the scalp of the coach, Luxemburgo, and caused a national outcry that created the political impetus to start the hearings. The hearings: team sheet Ronaldo The striker is due to explain what went on at the 1998 World Cup final in France. The inquiry wants to know whether he was picked because of pressure from the team sponsor, Nike, despite having suffered convulsions before the game. Edu Arsenal signed Edu, one of Brazil's best defenders, from Sao Paulo club Corinthians in June. But he showed UK immigration officers a fake Portuguese passport and was turned back.

      "bodyText": "Japan's ruling party was plunged into open revolt yesterday when one of its most powerful members threatened to topple the administration of the unpopular prime minister, Yoshiro Mori. Koichi Kato, a former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party and the head of one of its biggest factions, said he was ready to abstain during a no-confidence motion that the opposition is expected to submit by the end of the month. If he is followed by all 62 members of his faction, the ruling coalition would lose its majority in the 480-seat lower chamber of parliament and the government would be forced to call a general election. Little love is lost between Harvard-educated Mr Kato, who has a reputation for fiscal rectitude and social reform, and Mr Mori, an old-fashioned conservative who has pursued a free-spending economic policy. In recent months, Mr Kato has distanced himself increasingly from the premier, whose tendency to put his foot in his mouth has made him a laughing stock among the electorate He has refused to join the cabinet and has used his outsider status to snipe at the government's failure to address the ballooning public debt, which stands at about 130% of Japan's annual output. Until now, he has toed the party line in expressing his support for Mr Mori even while his cadres have been scheming behind the scenes. Yesterday, however, he appeared to make his move. In a leaked conversation with one of Mr Mori's aides, he said he might not show up for a no-confidence motion. \"We have to think very hard about whether it is right to back a prime minister who has lost the support of more than 70% of the electorate,\" he later told reporters.

An opinion poll in the newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Monday showed that only 6% of voters thought Mr Mori was the best person to be prime minister. A magazine, Uwasa no Shino, sued Mr Mori yesterday, demanding that he pay 10m yen (\u00a365,000) for suing it over a story alleging that he was arrested in a brothel in his youth. With an upper-house election due next summer, many in the LDP - especially young politicians with vulnerable seats - have been plotting to remove Mr Mori before his unpopularity rubs off on them. Yesterday, however, LDP elders rallied around their leader and criticised Mr Kato for his disloyalty and his timing - on the day that the government submitted a 4.78 trillion yen (\u00a329bn) supplementary budget bill to stave off recession. \"Given Japan's difficult economic situation, everyone should be pulling together,\" said Junichiro Koizumi, the head of Mr Mori's faction.",

Nuns and gunmen, middle aged businessmen - with starched pocket handkerchiefs - and Islamists in flowing robes turned out in their thousands to bury a leader of Yasser Arafat's Fatah party and two elderly women cut down by Israeli helicopters in a wealthy suburb of Bethlehem. Thursday's attack galvanised Palestinians, erasing divisions of religion, class and political affiliation, and uniting a population in grief and anger. But Mr Barak, undaunted by a growing Palestinian resolve to continue their intifada, said Israel was committed to an aggressive new policy of pre-emptive attacks. \"We will continue with such operations,\" the prime minister said during a visit to his army's West Bank headquarters. \"We will hit those who hit us.\" Mr Barak's tough posture is certain to cause further dismay in Washington, where President Clinton met Mr Arafat on Thursday in yet another attempt to pull Israel and the Palestinians back from war to negotiations. The Palestinian leader said he had reaffirmed his commitment to peace, and even to direct talks with Mr Barak - provided such a meeting had greater chances of success than the collapsed Camp David summit of last July. He was to visit the United Nations tonight to press his campaign for an international protection force for the West Bank and Gaza. The renewed diplomacy brought few concrete signs for hope. \"We continue to be frustrated,\" the White House spokesman, PJ Crowley, said. That situation is unlikely to change tomorrow when Mr Barak takes his turn at meeting President Clinton. Yesterday, he said it would be \"a little too far-fetched\" to expect a resumption of negotiations. Instead, Mr Barak said, as he has so many times during these last six weeks, that the violence must end first. But in Beit Sahour, where thousands gathered at a local schoolyard over the flag-draped coffins of the two elderly women who were among the first victims of his new \"initiated\" military policy, Palestinians were clear that it was Israel that was the source of the violence. \"This is a real crime... they are doing to our people,\" said a nun from St Joseph's school in Bethlehem. Behind her was a lorryload of teenagers, in black T-shirts printed overnight with the image of the newest martyr: Hussein Abayat, a local leader of Mr Arafat's Fatah militia, clad in fatigues and holding an assault rifle. \"Down with the olive branch, up with the gun,\" they chanted. Israel said Abayat was responsible for killing three of its soldiers, and for the nightly gunfire on the Jewish settlement of Gilo, built on land confiscated from a Palestinian village on the southern edges of Jerusalem. The Palestinians see his assassination - and the killing of the two women - as a clear sign that Israel has turned its guns on Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, which had been preaching peace for seven years. Yesterday, the sense of betrayal ran deep. \"Revenge, revenge for the three the Israelis slaughtered with their missiles,\" said the imam presiding over the women's funeral. \"We are more united, Muslim and Christian. This is the land of Jesus and the prophet Mohammed so both Christians and Muslims have the right to struggle against the occupation.\" The Palestinians got their revenge minutes later when an Israeli soldier was shot in the neck outside Rachel's tomb, a biblical pilgrimage site that is a constant battleground between Israelis and Palestinians. Another Israeli soldier was injured outside Ramallah as a declared \"day of rage\" saw clashes the length of the West Bank and in Gaza. At least three Palestinians were killed, and 168 injured yesterday, the Red Crescent Society said.",

He is an up-to-the minute baboon with a ryhming couplet to comment on the latest headlines.</p> <p>True, he can be repetitive. Ehud Barak's courtship of Ariel Sharon induced a stream of circular invective. He cannot get over Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia.

This is a creature their ancestors dragged - stole - from Greece. Cast in marble, he is sprawled above a gurgling bath tub, propped up on an elbow.</p> <p>A man's bearded face grins above the neck, but below is a different story. A green mossy substance shrouds the muscular body in fuzz. More ape than human, he has given the street its name, Via del Babuino.</p> <p>His career started in imperial times when offending the rich and powerful could lead to death, or at least exile, as befell the poet Ovid. The villa he pined for but never saw again was unearthed by builders only last week.</p> <p>The baboon made his debut at dawn: a sign around his neck, placed by unknown hands during the night, proclaiming the idiocy of a certain noble. Crowds gathered as word spread.</p> <p>The emperor, so it is said, was tickled, and a star was born. Dissenters, complainers, grumps, eccentrics, radicals, all came to deposit messages.</p> <p>Today the street gleams with fashion boutiques but the baboon is as loud as ever, yelling not from signs but graffitti on the wall behind.</p> <p>It is cleaned every fortnight but the writing returns.</p> <p>Yesterday: \"Israel will pay\", \"So will Jeb\", \"But not Berlusconi\".

      "bodyText": "There are many things weird about the baboon. He is furry rather than hairy. He sits on the street all day. He spurts water. He makes political statements. He is ignored. Romans say he has been there for 2,000 years and they have heard it all before, but they can't have. He is an up-to-the minute baboon with a ryhming couplet to comment on the latest headlines. True, he can be repetitive. Ehud Barak's courtship of Ariel Sharon induced a stream of circular invective. He cannot get over Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia. Mr Bush he does not like. But most days he is a baboon with a fresh take on a fresh subject. So why don't people listen? At the very least it's rude. This is a creature their ancestors dragged - stole - from Greece. Cast in marble, he is sprawled above a gurgling bath tub, propped up on an elbow. A man's bearded face grins above the neck, but below is a different story. A green mossy substance shrouds the muscular body in fuzz. More ape than human, he has given the street its name, Via del Babuino. His career started in imperial times when offending the rich and powerful could lead to death, or at least exile, as befell the poet Ovid. The villa he pined for but never saw again was unearthed by builders only last week. The baboon made his debut at dawn: a sign around his neck, placed by unknown hands during the night, proclaiming the idiocy of a certain noble. Crowds gathered as word spread. The emperor, so it is said, was tickled, and a star was born. Dissenters, complainers, grumps, eccentrics, radicals, all came to deposit messages. Today the street gleams with fashion boutiques but the baboon is as loud as ever, yelling not from signs but graffitti on the wall behind. It is cleaned every fortnight but the writing returns. Yesterday: \"Israel will pay\", \"So will Jeb\", \"But not Berlusconi\". Three different hands, in descending order, attacking Israel's violence, George Bush's brother's failure to deliver Florida and a media magnate's alleged tax evasion. Some comments are cruel. After a helicopter crash killed seven Carabinieri police officers: \"Yee ha! Stick to horses, boys.\" Opposition to authority blooms in Campo dei Fiori, a beautiful square on the other side of town. They have usually cleared up and melted away by the time tourists arrive for dinner but this is where the anarchists congregate.

      "body": "<p>American legal experts believe that aggrieved voters in Florida's Palm Beach county have a basis on which to go to court to have Tuesday's voting in their area overturned. The key question, though, is whether the courts will dare to uphold the Palm Beach voters' claim.</p> <p>It is one thing to overturn an election for the local school board. It is quite another to order a re-run which could have the most dramatic nationwide consequences possible.</p> <p>Courts in the US, like those in most democracies, are very reluctant to get involved in elections. The pressures in a case brought in Palm Beach would be the most intense imaginable. Not only would the presidency itself be at stake, but there is also a tight constitutional timetable to be met, and courts do not like to be rushed.</p> <p>There are, however, precedents to give encouragement to those who are trying to bring a case. As recently as 1998, Florida's supreme court said disputed elections could be declared void even where there was no allegation of fraud or intentional wrongdoing - which is the case in the Palm Beach dispute.</p> <p>In almost all circumstances, the right of action seems to lie in the Florida courts and with the voters of Florida rather than with Al Gore and the Democratic party. The party can fund the voters' case, however, and Mr Gore is expected to try to raise up to $5m (\u00a33.3m) for the purpose if necessary.</p> <p>Aggrieved voters in Palm Beach say their intention to vote for the candidate of their choice was frustrated by the now celebrated two-page \"butterfly\" ballot paper issued in their county.</p> <p>That paper listed George W Bush on the top line on the left hand side and Al Gore beneath him. But the second hole down in the line of holes which the voters had to punch to record their vote was the one which registered a vote for the Reform candidate Pat Buchanan, whose name appeared on the right hand side. Mr Gore's hole was the third one.</p> <p>Lawyers say the ballot paper provides two grounds for legal action. First it did not conform to Florida election law, which states that voters must make their mark to the right of the name of the candidate.</p> <p>Second, the lawyers argue, the ballot caused voters to be confused and thus to be effectively disenfranchised. Many voters claim to have voted in error for Mr Buchanan, while 19,000 ballot papers in Palm Beach county were invalidated because voters voted twice.</p> <p>The Florida precedent which seems to allow the aggrieved voters to make their case came in a disputed sheriff's election in 1998, when the state supreme court ruled that courts can invalidate an election when \"reasonable doubt exists as to whether an election expressed the will of the voters\".</p> <p>In such circumstances, the courts must declare the election void, \"even in the absence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing\". Challenges could be based on fraud, bribery and the ineligibility of candidates - none of which apply in the present case - as well as \"any other cause or allegation\" that would show voters' intentions had been frustrated.</p> <p>Election supervisors will be able to argue that 400,000 other voters in the county successfully mastered the butterfly ballot. And they can point to a 1974 Florida case which held that \"mere confusion does not amount to an impediment to the voters' free choice if reasonable time and study will sort it out\". Moreover, butterfly ballots have been used before in Palm Beach and have not caused objections.</p> <p>Even if the plaintiffs have a right of action, the courts have always been very reluctant to order election re-runs, even in the 1998 case. But they certainly would have the power to do so. The most probable re-run order - if one is made at all - would confine the right to vote in the second election to those who voted in the first.</p> <p>A key objection to a re-run is that it would take place in such different circumstances to the original contest. The second time around, voters would know they held the future of the presidency in their hands.</p> <p>By and large, the US federal courts leave such disputes to local courts and most lawyers think the federal courts will not want to become involved. Judges at every level in Florida are appointed by the state governor, currently the Republican Jeb Bush, on the recommendation of a commission of legal experts. All seven of the Florida high court judges who might hear a Palm Beach case were appointed by earlier Democratic governors.</p> <p>However, Florida judges are also subject to periodic elections. Judges who sat in the case would do so in the knowledge that they could become marked men or women by whichever party felt aggrieved by their ruling.</p> <p>If separate allegations that black voters were unable to vote on Tuesday were to be substantiated, the federal courts would become involved.</p> <p>The stakes are so high that some experts have begun to envisage a different scenario, in which Florida's election remains unresolved in legal terms by the time the electoral college meets to award the presidency next month.</p> <p>If Florida is unable to certify a team of 25 electors to take part in the December 18 meeting, neither candidate could muster the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory.</p> <p>Then the issue would go to the House of Representatives, with each of the 50 state delegations having one vote. In that case, Mr Bush would become president.</p>",

      "bodyText": "American legal experts believe that aggrieved voters in Florida's Palm Beach county have a basis on which to go to court to have Tuesday's voting in their area overturned. The key question, though, is whether the courts will dare to uphold the Palm Beach voters' claim. It is one thing to overturn an election for the local school board. It is quite another to order a re-run which could have the most dramatic nationwide consequences possible. Courts in the US, like those in most democracies, are very reluctant to get involved in elections. The pressures in a case brought in Palm Beach would be the most intense imaginable. Not only would the presidency itself be at stake, but there is also a tight constitutional timetable to be met, and courts do not like to be rushed. There are, however, precedents to give encouragement to those who are trying to bring a case. As recently as 1998, Florida's supreme court said disputed elections could be declared void even where there was no allegation of fraud or intentional wrongdoing - which is the case in the Palm Beach dispute. In almost all circumstances, the right of action seems to lie in the Florida courts and with the voters of Florida rather than with Al Gore and the Democratic party. The party can fund the voters' case, however, and Mr Gore is expected to try to raise up to $5m (\u00a33.3m) for the purpose if necessary. Aggrieved voters in Palm Beach say their intention to vote for the candidate of their choice was frustrated by the now celebrated two-page \"butterfly\" ballot paper issued in their county. That paper listed George W Bush on the top line on the left hand side and Al Gore beneath him. But the second hole down in the line of holes which the voters had to punch to record their vote was the one which registered a vote for the Reform candidate Pat Buchanan, whose name appeared on the right hand side. Mr Gore's hole was the third one. Lawyers say the ballot paper provides two grounds for legal action. First it did not conform to Florida election law, which states that voters must make their mark to the right of the name of the candidate. Second, the lawyers argue, the ballot caused voters to be confused and thus to be effectively disenfranchised. Many voters claim to have voted in error for Mr Buchanan, while 19,000 ballot papers in Palm Beach county were invalidated because voters voted twice. The Florida precedent which seems to allow the aggrieved voters to make their case came in a disputed sheriff's election in 1998, when the state supreme court ruled that courts can invalidate an election when \"reasonable doubt exists as to whether an election expressed the will of the voters\". In such circumstances, the courts must declare the election void, \"even in the absence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing\". Challenges could be based on fraud, bribery and the ineligibility of candidates - none of which apply in the present case - as well as \"any other cause or allegation\" that would show voters' intentions had been frustrated. Election supervisors will be able to argue that 400,000 other voters in the county successfully mastered the butterfly ballot. And they can point to a 1974 Florida case which held that \"mere confusion does not amount to an impediment to the voters' free choice if reasonable time and study will sort it out\". Moreover, butterfly ballots have been used before in Palm Beach and have not caused objections. Even if the plaintiffs have a right of action, the courts have always been very reluctant to order election re-runs, even in the 1998 case. But they certainly would have the power to do so. The most probable re-run order - if one is made at all - would confine the right to vote in the second election to those who voted in the first. A key objection to a re-run is that it would take place in such different circumstances to the original contest. The second time around, voters would know they held the future of the presidency in their hands. By and large, the US federal courts leave such disputes to local courts and most lawyers think the federal courts will not want to become involved. Judges at every level in Florida are appointed by the state governor, currently the Republican Jeb Bush, on the recommendation of a commission of legal experts. All seven of the Florida high court judges who might hear a Palm Beach case were appointed by earlier Democratic governors. However, Florida judges are also subject to periodic elections. Judges who sat in the case would do so in the knowledge that they could become marked men or women by whichever party felt aggrieved by their ruling. If separate allegations that black voters were unable to vote on Tuesday were to be substantiated, the federal courts would become involved. The stakes are so high that some experts have begun to envisage a different scenario, in which Florida's election remains unresolved in legal terms by the time the electoral college meets to award the presidency next month. If Florida is unable to certify a team of 25 electors to take part in the December 18 meeting, neither candidate could muster the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory. Then the issue would go to the House of Representatives, with each of the 50 state delegations having one vote. In that case, Mr Bush would become president.",

The vice-president has no choice but to pursue this matter as long as it takes. He won the popular vote nationwide and we have to believe that he also won the popular vote in Florida.

Notice the similarity. Both reflect our divisions. What an ugly sight. While nearly half of those who voted supported Bush and nearly half cast their lot for Gore, neither man was a clear-cut winner. The resulting confusion and bitterness only serves to drive Americans further into separate camps. This mess is the logical outcome when campaigns are built on endurance and destruction, not leadership and inspiration. </p> <p><b> Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</b> Whether the future holds a President Bush or a President Gore, this election will have conferred all the power of the presidency, not necessarily the authority.

      "bodyText": "Dallas Morning News Cooler heads must recognise that this nation cannot be kept indefintely in limbo while every vagary in the voting process is put under the legal microscope in a highly-charged political atmosphere. If the Florida clarification process is expanded to include a count by hand in four counties, as the Democratic campaign wants, then in fairness other close results in other counties would have to be canvassed as well - and then where and when would it end? Toledo Blade It is galling to hear Republican party officials complain that Mr Gore is a sore loser who can't bear to accept that he may have lost this election. The vice-president has no choice but to pursue this matter as long as it takes. He won the popular vote nationwide and we have to believe that he also won the popular vote in Florida. Florida governor Jeb Bush's job was to carry his state for his brother. Whether he did or didn't, he is forever tainted by this fiasco. Plain Dealer, Cleveland Take a long look at a map showing the states won by George Bush and Al Gore. Notice the similarity. Both reflect our divisions. What an ugly sight. While nearly half of those who voted supported Bush and nearly half cast their lot for Gore, neither man was a clear-cut winner. The resulting confusion and bitterness only serves to drive Americans further into separate camps. This mess is the logical outcome when campaigns are built on endurance and destruction, not leadership and inspiration. Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Whether the future holds a President Bush or a President Gore, this election will have conferred all the power of the presidency, not necessarily the authority. But that is the way it has always been. It is not the margin of electoral victory that in the end confers legitimacy on a president, but what he does in office.",

It may take the Americans until December to find out who won their presidential election, but the Serbians managed to get a result within two weeks: not on a recount but by storming the parliament building after Slobodan Milosevic tried to fiddle the votes in the September 24 poll. \"It seems our virus of election manipulation has now found its way to America,\" said Velimir Ilic, mayor of Cacak, who, early in October, led armed men and a bulldozer through police blockades from his town to storm the parliament in Belgrade. Russians, for decades on the receiving end of US lectures about democracy, also allowed themselves a touch of smugness yesterday. Alexander Veshnyakov, head of the central elections commission, who was criticised earlier this year for irregularities in Russia's presidential contest, said the US system was \"undemocratic and confusing\", and advised Americans to learn from Russia. Boris Nemtsov, a leading liberal, former deputy prime minister and a frequent recipient of US advice on democracy-building, said he expected the US to get rid of its electoral college and move toward direct elections. \"They would then catch up with Russia,\" he said. But in a snipe at both voting systems, the satirical website, www.anekdote.ru, fantasised that the US had sought technical help from the Russian central election commission to get it out of its difficulties. \"Veshnyakov has flown to the US. Latest reports show Vladimir Putin in the lead,\" it quipped. In Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe has been in power since 1980, and his most recent electoral campaign was marred by by intimidation and violence, the government's spokesman, Jonathan Moyo, said it made no sense that Al Gore could win the popular vote without winning the presidency. \"We could not get away with something like that in Zimbabwe without the threat of sanctions,\" he said. America's electoral muddle has given the \"emerging democracies\" an opportunity to mock their mentor. They are usually expected to welcome international observers at election time to ensure fair play, and if they do not, aid from the US and other western countries may be at risk. \"Maybe Africans and others should send observers to help Americans deal with their democracy,\" Mr Moyo told BBC radio 4. \"Call it American democracy at work, but for most people outside the US watching the presidential ballot in Florida, it looked like a third world election fiasco,\" columnist Thanong Khanthong wrote in Thailand's Nation newspaper. International relations expert M Shahiduzzman in Bangladesh called the all-or-nothing US system \"pathetically flawed\". India, which boasts that it is the world's largest democracy, was also quick to adopt a \"it couldn't happen here\" line. Chief election commissioner M Gill said: \"The US may be the most technologically-advanced country, but our electoral system is any day better... Their delegate system is archaic.\" He conceded that fraud was widespread in India, but said if irregularities were found, there was a new poll.

Senior Democrats have warned Mr Gore in a series of mainly private but sometimes public messages that the US political system may not be able to take the strain if he presses ahead regardless with plans to challenge Tuesday's elections in the Florida courts. Party leaders are worried that public support for Mr Gore's challenge to George W Bush's claims to the presidency, currently running at well above 50% in the opinion polls, may begin to drain away if Mr Bush is once more declared the winner in Florida when all the votes are counted. The key deadline in America's post-election uncertainty seems increasingly to be next Friday, the final date by which the state's overseas postal votes can be accepted by election officials. Republicans redoubled the pressure on Mr Gore to throw in the towel even sooner than that.

      "body": "<p>Summer evenings at the Bistro Gardens in Beverly Hills tended toward the languorous. My friend Jack and I went there often when I lived in Los Angeles. From time to time, Jack would use the occasion to suggest we get married. It was an idea with such potential for catastrophe that neither of us had much of an inclination to take it with much gravity. But our friendship we took seriously. </p> <p>This particular evening, I found myself edgily knocking the ice cubes around in my whisky glass. We were making a blood oath: if either of us again became deeply suicidal, we agreed, we would meet at Jack's home on Cape Cod. Once there, the nonsuicidal one would have a week to persuade the other not to commit suicide; a week to present all the reasons we could come up with for why the other should go back on lithium (we both had manic-depressive illness and had a tendency to stop taking our lithium); a week to cajole the other into a hospital; to invoke conscience; to impress upon the other the pain and damage to our families that suicide would bring. </p> <p>We would, we said, walk along the beach and remind the other of all of the times we had felt at the end of hope and, somehow, had come back. Who, if not someone who had actually been there, could better bring the other back from the edge? </p> <p>We decided that a week was long enough to argue for life. If it didn't work, at least we would have tried. And, because we had years of experience with impetuousness and knew how quick and final a suicidal impulse could be, we further agreed that neither of us would ever buy a gun. </p> <p>\"Cheers,\" we said in synchrony, ice and glass clinking, sealing our foray into the rational world. Still, I had my doubts. I listened to the details, helped clarify a few, finished my scotch, and stared at the tiny white lights in the gardens around us. Who were we kidding? Never once, during any of my bouts of depression, had I been inclined or able to pick up a telephone and ask a friend for help. It wasn't in me. How could I seriously imagine that I would call Jack, book a flight, get to an airport, rent a car, and find my way out to his house on the Cape? It seemed only slightly less absurd that Jack would go along with the plan, although he, at least, was rich and could get others to handle the practicalities. </p> <p>It is a tribute to the persuasiveness and infinite capacity for self-deception of two manic temperaments that by the time the desserts arrived we were utterly convinced that our pact would hold. He would call me; I would call him; we would outmanoeuvre the black knight and force him from the board. </p> <p>The black knight, however, has a tendency to remain in play. And so it did. Many years later - Jack had long since married and I had moved to Washington - I received a phone call from California: Jack had put a gun to his head, said a relative. He had killed himself. </p> <p>No week in Cape Cod, no chance to dissuade. A man who had been inventive enough to earn a thousand patents for such diverse creations as the Hawk and Sparrow missile systems used by the US Defense Department, toys played with by millions of children, and household devices used in millions of homes; a Yale graduate and lover of life; a successful businessman - this remarkably imaginative man had not been inventive enough to find an alternative solution to a violent, self-inflicted death. </p> <p>Although shaken by Jack's suicide, I was not surprised by it. Nor was I surprised that he had not called me. I, after all, had been dangerously suicidal myself on several occasions since our Bistro Gardens compact and had not called him. Suicide does not always hearken to plans drawn up in lucid moments and banked in good intentions. </p> <p>I know this for an unfortunate fact. Suicide has been a professional interest of mine for more than 20 years, and a personal one for far longer. I have a hard-earned respect for suicide's ability to undermine, overwhelm, devastate and destroy. As a clinician, researcher, and professor of psychiatry, I have known patients who hanged, shot, or asphyxiated themselves; jumped to their deaths from stairwells, buildings or overpasses; died from poisons, fumes, prescription drugs; slashed their wrists or cut their throats. Friends, fellow students from graduate school and children of colleagues have done the same. Most were young and suffered from mental illness; all left behind a wake of unimaginable pain and guilt. </p> <p>Like many who have manic-depressive illness, I have also known suicide in a more private, awful way, and I trace the loss of a fundamental innocence to the day that I first considered suicide as the solution to an unendurable level of mental pain. Until that time I had taken for granted, and loved more than I knew, a temperamental lightness of mood and a fabulous expectation of life. I was 17 when, in the midst of my first depression, I became knowledgeable about suicide in something other than an existential, adolescent way. </p> <p>I thought about when, whether, where, and how to kill myself. I learned to present to others a face at variance with my mind; ferreted out the location of two or three nearby tall buildings with unprotected stairwells; discovered the fastest flows of morning traffic; and learned how to load my father's gun. </p> <p>The rest of my life - sports, classes, writing, friends, planning for college - fell fast into a black night. Everything seemed a ridiculous charade; a hollow existence to fake one's way through as best one could. But gradually the depression lifted, and by the time my senior prom came around, I had been well for months. Suicide had withdrawn to the back squares of the board and become, once again, unthinkable. </p> <p> Over the years, my manic-depressive illness became worse, and the reality of dying young from suicide became a dangerous undertow in my dealings with life. Then, when I was 28, after a damaging and psychotic mania followed by a prolonged siege of depression, I took a massive overdose of lithium. I unambivalently wanted to die and nearly did. Under the circumstances - I was a young faculty member in a department of academic psychiatry - it was not a very long walk from personal experience to clinical investigation. I studied everything I could about my disease and read all I could find about the psychological and biological determinants of suicide, as a tiger tamer learns about the minds and moves of his cats. </p> <p>No one knows who was the first to slash his throat with a piece of flint, or take a handful of poison berries, or intentionally drop his spear to the ground in battle. Death, as Seneca states, has always lain close at hand; yet it is a mystery why the first to kill himself did. Was it a sudden impulse, or prolonged disease? An inner voice, commanding death? Perhaps shame or the threat of capture by an enemy? Despair? Exhaustion? </p> <p>We do, however, have what psychiatrist Chris Thomas believes to be the first extant suicide note. Four thousand years ago, an Egyptian wrote his despair on to papyrus in the form of a narrative and four short-versed poems. This document, now in the Berlin Museum, reflects the ruminations of a deeply depressed, probably psychotic mind: </p> <p> Lo, my name is abhorred, </p> <p>Lo, more than than the odour of carrion </p> <p>On summer days when the sky is hot. </p> <p>Death is before me today </p> <p>As a man longs to see his house </p> <p>When he has spent years in captivity. </p> <p>Cultures have varied in their notions of self-inflicted death. Several - for example, the Eskimos, Norse, Samoan, and Crow Indian - accepted, and even encouraged, \"altruistic\" self-sacrifice among the elderly and sick. Among the Yuit Eskimos of St Lawrence Island, if an individual requested suicide three times, relatives were obligated to assist in the killing. The person seeking suicide dressed in ritual death garb and then was killed in a \"destroying place\" set aside for the purpose. </p> <p>The Catholic church, during the sixth and seventh centuries, codified its opposition to suicide by excommunicating and denying funeral rites to those who died by their own hand. Jewish custom forbade funeral orations for anyone who committed suicide; mourners' clothes were not encouraged, and burial was limited to an isolated section of the cemetery, so as \"not to bury the wicked next to the righteous\". In Islamic law, suicide is a crime at least as grave as homicide. In many countries, the bodies of those who killed themselves were buried at night and at a crossroads. The greater traffic was thought to \"keep the corpses down\", and the intersection, it was believed, would make it more difficult for the spirit to find its way home. </p> <p>Robert Burton's influential The Anatomy of Melancholy, which argued for mercy for those who were in such despair and agitation as to kill themselves, was published in 1621. Twenty-five years later, Biathanatos, a landmark treatise on suicide, was published. Its author, John Donne, was also the dean of St Paul's Cathedral. In Biathanatos, Donne declared that suicide was, on occasion, justified; certainly it was understandable. It was, for him, personal. \"Whensoever any affliction assails me,\" he confessed in the preface, \"methinks I have the keys of my prison in mine own hand, and no remedy presents itself so soon to my heart as mine own sword.\" </p> <p>Suicide in the young has at least tripled over the past 45 years and is, without argument, one of our most serious public health problems. It is the second major killer of women between the ages of 15 and 44 worldwide (after TB) and the fourth of men in the same age group (after road accidents, TB and violence). For every completed suicide there are estimated to be 10 to 25 attempts. </p> <p>In his memoir A Sort of Life, Graham Greene described his early encounters with suicidal depression. While still at school, \"I tried out other forms of escape after I failed to cut my leg. Once at home I went into the dark room by the linen-cupboard, and in that red Mephistophelean glare drank a quantity of hypo under the false impression it was poisonous. On another occasion I drained my blue glass bottle of hay-fever drops, which, as they contained a small quantity of cocaine, were probably good for my despair. A bunch of deadly nightshade picked and eaten on the common had only a slightly narcotic effect and I once swallowed 20 aspirins before swimming in the school baths.\" </p> <p>When Greene was 19, he took his brother's revolver from the cupboard in their bedroom -\"I felt nothing. I was fixed, like a negative in a chemical bath\" - and walked into the woods: \"I slipped a bullet into a chamber and, holding the revolver behind my back, spun the chamber_ [put] the muzzle into my right ear and pulled the trigger. There was a minute click, and looking down at the chamber I could see that the charge had moved into the firing position. I was out by one. The experience I repeated a number of times...\" </p> <p>Greene did not, in the end, kill himself. But the possibility of suicide was a recurring presence in his life and, as for many with depression, the seeming best response to bale and weariness. He continued to wage war against his black depressions, \"the hopeless misery of the years\", as he put it, using alcohol, the perverse exhilaration of Russian roulette, and travels into war zones and other areas of high political and social volatility, as antidotes to his bled-out state. </p> <p>The 18th-century poet Thomas Chatterton wrote Suicide a few months before he swallowed a fatal dose of arsenic. </p> <p> Since we can die but once, what matters it, </p> <p>If rope or garter, poison, pistol, sword, </p> <p>Slow-wasting sickness, or the sudden burst </p> <p>Of valve arterial in the noble parts </p> <p>Curtail the miseries of human life? </p> <p>Though varied is the cause, the effect's the same: </p> <p>All to one common dissolution tends. </p> <p>Not long before he died in 1770, he wrote, \"Cease my anguish'd soul_ and this last act of wretchedness forgive.\" He was 17. </p> <p>Symbolism and suggestion have played their part in the circumstances of self-inflicted deaths. Some places become \"suicide magnets\", drawing to them not only the impulsive but the more chronically suicidal as well. At Beachy Head on the South Downs of the English coast, suicides have been reported since the sixth century. </p> <p>Jumping from public monuments has also had a contagious allure - the Eiffel Tower in Paris, St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Empire State Building in New York. Mount Mihara, an active volcano on the Japanese island of Oshima, was almost entirely unknown until January 1933, when two classmates from a Tokyo college climbed to the top of the crater. There Meiko Ukei, 24, announced to her friend Masako Tomita that she intended to throw herself into the volcano. She would, she explained, be cremated instantly and sent heavenward in smoke and beauty. After extracting a vow of secrecy from her friend, she jumped. </p> <p>Masako, 21, was understandably unable to keep her promise. She confided in another friend, who then insisted that Masako take her to Mihara so that she could \"follow Meiko to paradise\". Masako was unable to persuade her friend otherwise, and in early February the two women climbed to the top of the volcano. The friend jumped in, Masako returned alone, and soon the story was a major force in the cultural life of Japan. </p> <p>People swarmed to Mihara, first by steamer and then by a larger boat that was required to handle the curious. On an April Sunday not long after the deaths of the two young women, six people leaped into the volcano; 25 others had to be restrained from doing so. Tourists lined up to watch the suicides, which were now occurring several times a week. By year's end, at least 140 people had committed suicide. </p> <p> The following year, more than 160 plunged to their deaths and another 1,200 had to be restrained from following suit. In January 1935, three young men jumped to their deaths within 10 minutes of one another. The police set up a 24-hour watch at the crater, and a barbed-wire fence was erected; yet in 1936, at least 600 people killed themselves. Access to the mountain was eventually closed, but not before at least 1,000 people had thrown themselves into Mihara. </p> <p>Today, as suicide rates increase, the World Health Organisation has outlined six basic steps for the prevention of suicide, most of which centre on reducing the availability of methods; gun possession control, detoxification of domestic gas, detoxification of car emissions, control of toxic substance availability, more effective treatment of mental disorders, and toning down suicide reports in the media. </p> <p>Psychologists are deciphering the motivations for suicide and piecing together the circumstances that so dangerously ignite the brain's vulnerabilities. But I have become more impatient as a result of writing this book. I cannot rid my mind of the desolation, confusion and guilt I have seen in the relatives and friends of those who kill themselves. For every moment of exuberance in the science, or in the success of governments, there is a matching and terrible reality of the deaths themselves; the young deaths, the violent deaths, the unnecessary deaths. </p> <p>While writing this book, I kept on my desk a fragment of a poem .

The biblical flood lasted the same length of time. The myth of how God made the sky fall on the earth but allowed Noah to escape with the animals has passed down the generations. </p> <p>Little changes. In the old days, God was the administration. He alone ruled and he alone decided that man was corrupt, greedy and in need of a lesson. Today, the scientists are godlike, Prince Charles is the Old Testament prophet and the government preaches caution. They all say that we have induced global warming by corrupting the balance of nature with our profligacy and must learn to adapt. </p> <p>Noah got the Flood. We get the floods. The only difference is that we are told that if we don't change we'll get massive storms, temperature extremes, sea-level rise and pestilence, too. Everything in the zeitgeist gets worse, it seems, except for old complacents like Sir John Mortimer who still believe global warming will be rather pleasant because we'll be able to grow more grapes. </p> <p>The parallels between the two deluges are notable. Noah used the highest technology of his day to save himself and his charges. He built a 140m long ark remarkably quickly. We, too, rely on our technology to come up with a quick fix. Scientists and governments say we should buy fuel efficient cars and turn to wind and wave power. If all else fails, we can pour iron filings on the sea, put mirrors in space to turn the sun's rays back or all head off from the sinking planet on an ark of a spaceship to do some terraforming on Mars. </p> <p>And as there was hope then, so there is today. Noah sent a dove to see if there was dry land and it returned with an olive branch, signalling that the waters were receding. The modern flight of fancy is our investment of hope in the United Nations, under whose auspices world governments will meet on Monday in the Hague to thrash out measures to slow global warming. The logo of the UN? That same olive branch. It's apt, too, that Holland was created largely from the sea. </p> <p>Mankind is drowning in flood myths. Mark Isaac, an American researcher, has documented almost 200 cultures on every continent with myths or legends involving variations on the theme of sea waters rising or non-stop rains leading to disaster. In the epic poem Gilgamesh, the Sumerian gods get fed up with humanity and give man no warning about the floods they are about to send. In Yoruba (west Africa) myth, they spread oceans across the land because we are uppity; in Aztec culture, the Ancient One is fearfully upset because we do not honour him. He sends in the rains and only allows one family to escape, but the old boy has a sense of humour and turns them into monkeys because they chatter too much - whereupon he brings in new human recruits, the equivalent of Spanish nurses for the NHS. In Bolivia, the Snow God thinks humankind is arrogant and so covers the world in snow and ice and spares no one. </p> <p>More or less the same flood myth is found from the Philippines to the Pacific islands, taking in Australian Aboriginals, Inuits, Blackfeet and Cheyennes, Lithuanians, Celts, Assyrians , Zoroastrians, Egyptians and Chinese. Every culture, it seems, has a deep sense that it will be drowned if the dominant force of the times is ignored. </p> <p>For Gods then, read Nature now. Man-induced global warming is a replay of the eternal flood myth, writ fresh for the Millennium. It's not mythical in the sense of being \"wrong\"- it may one day be \"proved\" to be caused by sunspots or natural cycles, just as it may be shown eventually that it really is all mankind's fault - but it is a great allegory, the ultimate cautionary tale which we and future generations will tell and retell. It is culturally significant because it is the first secular myth to embrace all humanity and not just one tribe, civilisation or culture. </p> <p>It is the perfect myth for an increasingly globalising world. Its power to cross cultures is undoubted. In the past three years I have heard the new story of mankind's folly changing the climate and bringing destruction on everyone told in Timbuktu, the Colombian cloud forest, remote Indian villages and smog-bound Indonesia. Even the San, the bushmen of the Kalahari, have adapted man-induced global warming into their modern cosmology. The only places where it is not spoken of in some awe seems to be in George W Bush's Republican party in the US and the offices of the World Trade Organisation. But future generations may see them as the gods of this oil age. </p> <p>So what is the function of this myth? Global warming seems to fulfil all the elements of true myth. It binds society together, it warns everyone against folly, teaches us to think of our neighbours, has innocent parties (the poor) and guilty (the Americans, especially). Profoundly moral and allegorical, it holds open the option of both Christian redemption and of passage to a better, fairer, saner world. But it also allows every faith, and even the agnostic, to grasp the notion of metamorphosis. It will inform our intellectual and belief systems for generations. </p> <p>Its power is that, like all the myriad flood myths, it cannot be absolutely proved or disproved and so stays in the imagination. After several thousand years and generations of scientific advances and new understandings of plate tectonics, geology and archaeology, we still cannot say categorically that a catastrophic flood did not at some point in prehistory cover the whole earth - much to the delight of the Christian fundamentalists, who believe the Bible word for word. </p> <p> But we must tilt at our myths. In September, the oceanographer Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic, telephoned Tim Radford, the Guardian's science editor, from a research ship in the Black Sea. He had factual evidence that there had been a mighty flood in the Black Sea. </p> <p>Using remote-controlled underwater vessels with cameras, his team had located a former river valley. In the valley, 311ft below the present sea surface, was a collapsed but intact 39ft by 13ft structure with preserved wooden beams worked by hand. It was characteristic of Stone Age buildings 7,000 years ago in the interior of Turkey. </p> <p>It contained a stone chisel and two other stone tools with holes drilled through them. This was recognised as the missing evidence that the Black Sea had suddenly risen in level when a land barrier with the Mediterranean had failed, allowing water to surge in. </p> <p>The scientific fundamentalists reached for the hypothesis of two oceanographers, William Ryan and Walter Pitman, who had written a book postulating that the people of a flooded Black Sea civili sation had spread out across Africa, Asia and Europe, taking the story of the flood with them. This was the missing piece. Case shut? </p> <p>Of course not. The creationists were not remotely shaken out of their core beliefs. Genesis Ministries International, a leading fundamentalist group in the US, at once accepted Ballard's evidence of the Black Sea flood, but said it was just a local affair, offering no proof against the biblical world-wide one which has left its mark on every continent. </p> <p>The link with Noah's flood, they said, was arbitrary, and they hang on to their theory that Genesis's \"fountains of the great deep\" which mythically covered the mountains of the world in 40 days involved a series of volcanic eruptions with prodigious amounts of water bursting up through the ground. </p> <p>The wiser scientists kept the door open. It was not the final word one way or another. It neither proved nor disproved Noah' s flood, they said. The scientific jury's still out on global warming too and they'll be arguing about it in 100 years' time, whether we're growing grapes in Scotland or Africa has become a desert. And so will the proponents and opponents of all our other modern myths like the Gaia hypothesis, the big bang, alien abductions, conspiracy theories, Marxism, the myth of progress, the existence of evil, crop circles, the notion that salvation can come from scientific rationalism, or that technology or religion can save the world. </p> <p>Facts are not important in myths. Global warming caused by man's profligacy leading to catastrophic floods and rising seas is nothing to do with facts. It shows that we need the power of the imagination more than ever. Right or wrong. Come hell or high water.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is not often you find a play with a drama critic as hero, least of all one as glamorous as Kenneth Tynan. But the West Yorkshire Playhouse has managed it with. Janet Munsil's Smoking With Lulu, a wistful three-hander about Tynan's encounter with Louise Brooks. If the lives and careers of most critics amount to a near-miss, this play shows Tynan's to have achieved the status of near-myth. </p> <p>The play is based on a famous New Yorker profile Tynan wrote of the 1920s screen idol in 1979. He persuaded the reclusive Brooks to reveal her recollections of working on Pabst's Pandora's Box; the result is a love letter written by an ailing fan to an ageing star, both of whom were to die of emphysema - Tynan five years before Brooks. </p> <p>Munsil's not very original thesis is that Tynan was erotically haunted by Brooks's youthful screen presence - hence the existence of a third character, with bobbed, enamelled hair and a variety of silk knickers, who embodies Tynan's fantasies and becomes the eternal Lulu. </p> <p>The story has obvious echoes of Sunset Boulevard: a silent screen goddess finds her spirit re-awakened by an intrusive writer. But Munsil, to her credit, realises the crucial difference. Brooks, given a sprightly performance by Thelma Barlow, was a bedridden autodidact who loathed the Hollywood system and had no wish to confront a camera again. And Tynan, incarnated with uncanny accuracy by Peter Eyre, was no hapless hack but a well-primed admirer who appealed to a star who always fancied herself as a writer's moll. I intend no slur on them, or on Sophie Millett's delicately fetching Lulu, if I say that some of the best moments are those in which we see extracts from a pristine print of Pandora's Box: the reality is even better than the fiction. </p> <p>What Munsil never captures, however, is the thing that makes Tynan really significant and that earns him a foothold in posterity: his combination of a voluptuous prose style with a crusading moral fervour. As a critic, he fought for a socially committed drama, a national theatre and an internationalist outlook with all the eloquence at his command. And he did this not in language of pseudo-academic earnestness, but in prose where each phrase clicks into place with the satisfying resonance of billiard balls struck by a perfectly aimed cue. </p> <p>Of course, Tynan was a clutch of paradoxes, some of which Munsil conveys. He was a natural rule-breaker, appalled to think that his epitaph would be that of the first person to say \"fuck\" on television. He was a dedicated spanker who campaigned against all forms of institutionalised cruelty. He was a latterday egalitarian who adored stars. But although Munsil hints at his contradictions and uses smoking as an apt metaphor - \"I spent my life taking people's breath away and now I pay the penalty,\" says the coughing Tynan - she sees him as a Wildean hero who put his genius into his life and his talent into his work. I would argue the exact opposite: what really matters, in the end, is not his prosaic spanking but his spanking prose. </p> <p>In some ways, Tynan was fortunate in his timing. He took up his Observer post in 1954, when English drama was enfeebled by gentility, restraint and a head-under-the-bedclothes evasion of social issues; it desperately needed shaking into life. He was also lucky in that he grew up at a time when heroic individualism, exemplified by Olivier, Richardson and Wolfit, was prized in acting and cried out for a recording angel. And the essay tradition of Hazlitt and Shaw was still, albeit tenuously, alive in English criticism before the onset of a basically consumerist culture. But Tynan also made his own luck and showed, through his Augustan prose, how criticism could seem both sexy and important when informed by a responsible zeal. </p> <p>Tynan influenced a whole generation. I made my own stuttering entry into the business by parodying him in an Observer competition in 1960, and it was typical of his generosity that, when I bearded him at the Oxford Playhouse shortly after, he instantly recommended that I write to the paper's literary editor. Behind the international hedonist lay a gracious, sometimes surprisingly old-fashioned man. I remember being invited to a Christmas Eve do at his house in the early 1970s largely, I suspect, because of my enthusiasm for Trevor Griffiths's The Party. I went vaguely expecting an evening of sybaritic decadence; in fact, we spent much of the time doing a pencil-and-paper quiz that he had assiduously devised. </p> <p>Tynan's great achievement was to write passionately about a medium he assumed was central to our lives. Today theatre has to fight to be heard in an increasingly tacky celluloid culture. Having time to kill before the Leeds premiere, I took myself off to an outlying cinema to see What Lies Beneath, praised in some quarters as Hitchcockian. What I found was a movie complex that resembled a Technicolor version of Dante's Hell and a formulaic film built on the notion of a shock every seven minutes. To come back in the evening to Smoking With Lulu was to be reminded both of theatre's insidious potency and of an era when screen acting was allowed, in Louise Brooks's words, to express \"movements of thought and soul\". Tynan was fortunate to be writing in an age when art was more than a matter of visceral bombardment; and we, who stumble about in his shadow, can only recall that his true legacy does not lie in his sexual peculiarities. It is to be found in his belief that the job of the critic is to articulate crusading zeal in the most impassioned prose that he or she can muster. </p> <p>\u0095 Smoking With Lulu is at the Courtyard Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until December 2.

Better still, he didn't sing She. </p> <p>This is Aznavour's long goodbye, a concert series that concludes a career spanning six decades, 60 films and more than 1,000 songs. It didn't matter that no one listened to the first song. There were 30 or so others. Some were middle-of-the road jaunts, blameless and well-arranged.

      "body": "<p>Was Brahms bonkers? Having always considered him among the most humane and wisest of composers, as well as the greatest, I would have thought not. Christoph Von Dohnanyi, however, would seem to believe otherwise, as much of this concert at London's Royal Festival Hall, which coupled the Second Piano Concerto with the First Symphony, gave us a portrait of Brahms as a twitchy neurotic whose vision teeters on the disturbed. </p> <p>Classical structural tautness and romantic emotional depth co-exist in his music, and require equal emphasis. Dohnanyi sacrifices the emotion for the tautness, then turns it into unyielding rigidity. The First Symphony opens with one of music's great tragic statements, passing through hope, despair and tentative calm before the malign universe is transformed into a world of elation. Dohnanyi, however, hurls us into obsessional, driven territory, alienating us when we should be moved. The great transition in the finale goes for little, with no sense of redemption or release, while the final peroration seems to heave itself out of exhaustion. </p> <p>Moments of genuine insight come in the inner sections: the way the calm strings are suddenly knocked off balance by baleful brass in the slow movement was tellingly done. The programme informed us Dohnanyi had agreed to conduct the Philharmonia despite an injured shoulder. This may have affected his performance, but I wish he'd handed the baton to someone else. </p> <p>The Second Piano Concerto was equally disquieting, and marked the long-awaited return of Maurizio Pollini to the concerto repertory, his presence ensuring the hall was packed. Pollini was magnificent, breathtakingly alive to every flicker of emotion, but the necessary cohesion between soloist and orchestra was intermittent. Dohnanyi let rip when Pollini wasn't playing, producing a coarse majesty in places.

      "bodyText": "Was Brahms bonkers? Having always considered him among the most humane and wisest of composers, as well as the greatest, I would have thought not. Christoph Von Dohnanyi, however, would seem to believe otherwise, as much of this concert at London's Royal Festival Hall, which coupled the Second Piano Concerto with the First Symphony, gave us a portrait of Brahms as a twitchy neurotic whose vision teeters on the disturbed. Classical structural tautness and romantic emotional depth co-exist in his music, and require equal emphasis. Dohnanyi sacrifices the emotion for the tautness, then turns it into unyielding rigidity. The First Symphony opens with one of music's great tragic statements, passing through hope, despair and tentative calm before the malign universe is transformed into a world of elation. Dohnanyi, however, hurls us into obsessional, driven territory, alienating us when we should be moved. The great transition in the finale goes for little, with no sense of redemption or release, while the final peroration seems to heave itself out of exhaustion. Moments of genuine insight come in the inner sections: the way the calm strings are suddenly knocked off balance by baleful brass in the slow movement was tellingly done. The programme informed us Dohnanyi had agreed to conduct the Philharmonia despite an injured shoulder. This may have affected his performance, but I wish he'd handed the baton to someone else. The Second Piano Concerto was equally disquieting, and marked the long-awaited return of Maurizio Pollini to the concerto repertory, his presence ensuring the hall was packed. Pollini was magnificent, breathtakingly alive to every flicker of emotion, but the necessary cohesion between soloist and orchestra was intermittent. Dohnanyi let rip when Pollini wasn't playing, producing a coarse majesty in places. Coherence only came with the Andante, when Dohnanyi simmered down and the purity of Pollini's playing became transcendent. The finale was full of elegance, thrills and sensual nostalgia. Even so, the usually excellent Philharmonia seemed to be having an off night, and the evening was a major disappointment. Brahms and Pollini deserved better.",

It is an uphill struggle for all concerned: the tenor soloist (Christoph Homberger) appears looking dishevelled and distressed, relives the moments of the kidnapping, and tries to concentrate on what he is supposed to be performing, while the chorus are understandably much more concerned with what is happening to their colleagues than with the Lichtenberg cantata. </p> <p>The conductor ploughs on regardless, but he has a telephone next to him with which he can communicate with the unnamed kidnapper. The course of the work is interrupted 11 times by the ring ing of the phone. At one point the kidnapper demands food (\"Meatballs all round\"); at another, a ransom (\"A million, right?\"); halfway through, the conductor and a recording engineer discuss how well the recording of the performance is going. Meanwhile, the security response to the outrage is heard from outside the hall: helicopters circle overheard, and the noise of the police and fire services surrounds the building. </p> <p>The words, the composer's own except when fragments of the Lichtenberg music break through, are direct (\"Librettos are not great literature,\" Kagel said at a press conference before the performance) and he insists that they be delivered in the language of the audience in each venue. \"Fiction has to be real,\" he said, and so even the sounds of the police sirens are changed from country to country. </p> <p> But the illusion is not quite complete enough: what is going on outside the hall is never sufficiently vivid, and the deliberate vagueness of the ending is unsatisfactory.

It is a rich tapestry, in which 200 years of music tradition, as well as echoes of popular styles, are stitched into ever-changing textures, which play all kinds of tricks with traditional harmony and tonality.

      "body": "<p><strong> October 27 1999</strong> </p> <p>Yesterday driving to Gloucestershire, today to Provincetown in Massachusetts, after flying to Boston. \"Massachusetts is a glory in the Fall,\" says John Proctor in The Crucible. And it is - gold, red, pink, bronze, brown, pink, and yellow. I'm always pleasantly surprised by rural America; it's so unlike the urban clatter of New York, Los Angeles and Miami that passes for our TV- induced view of the country. There are so many stars and stripes - huge ones flapping like sheets, small ones waving like Tibetan prayer pennants. In our country, the union flag (apart from its official use) is only ever displayed ironically or as a sort defiant assertion of imperial status. Here the flags are like the shrines that spatter the Italian roadside, homely advertisements of faith. </p> <p>When we reach Provincetown, there are as many rainbow coalition flags as stars and stripes, declaring a different sort of faith - a belief in sexual tolerance. Which is possibly why writers and painters were drawn here since the 1890s to escape the summer heat of New York. One of the writers was Eugene O'Neill: it was here that he first had a play of his produced. </p> <p><strong> October 28</strong> </p> <p> The day is a clear, bright autumn day, sky of della Robbia blue. I've written something about O'Neill's story being an American folktale - unperformed playwright to Nobel prizewinner - and Chris, the director for the American episode, has translated this into film imagery: I'm on a horse posed like a frontiersman on a ridge of sand dunes talking about the small shacks where O'Neill and his pals stayed to write and paint. O'Neill lived here, off and on, for nine years - a stay punctuated by wild drinking bouts and capering on the beach half-naked in a fright wig, like Edgar in Lear. My horse is a handsome chestnut named Buddy; he has a western-style saddle which, after riding an English saddle, feels like a comfortable office chair. Buddy proves himself to be eponymously named, and galloping along the edge of the incoming tide, long having ceased to care whether this sequence is in any way gratuitous, I'm having about as much fun as one can have legally. Fred, the French cameraman, kneels by the seashore and asks me to gallop as close as I can to him; the hooves pass inches from the lens. Afterwards he confesses that he closed his eyes as I passed. </p> <p><strong> October 29</strong> <br> Early morning finds us under a pier squelching through the wet sand to the accompaniment of the chanting of sea- gulls. O'Neill's first play was staged in a converted shed on an old pier, which stank of fish and smoke from a recent fire. I doubt if any play had such a launching: there was a storm during the performance which rocked the pier and drove the sea up through the gaps in the floor, wetting the feet of the audience and actors. Afterwards we walk through the main street of the town, and feel like we've been inserted into The Truman Show. The town has the same genial, hospitable air of the movie - the same colonial- style clapboard houses, the same universal goodwill. But the extras have been re-programmed: instead of conventional couples with 2.5 children, the shops and the pavements are peopled with gay and lesbian couples and instead of groceries and hardware stores, there are gay clubs, art galleries and leather shops. Tennessee Williams spent a summer here - \"a sort of crash course in growing up\". I'll bet. He returned a few years later to finish writing The Glass Menagerie. It's an engaging paradox that the town's most famous resident now is the archbishop of macho: Norman Mailer. </p> <p><strong> October 30</strong> </p> <p> Dawn. Hoping for a dour sea mist to match O'Neill's dolefulness, we have a lavender dawn by Caspar David Friedrich. Then on the road to New York. As we drive out of town we pass what at first I take to be evidence of a lynching. It might be a sexual bigot, but it's a dummy with a skull for a head, hanging from a tree for Halloween. O'Neill said Provincetown was \"hard to get to and hard to get out of\". The latter proves to be uncomfortably true: it takes us eight hours to drive to New York, after getting lost in New Rochelle, landing up in New Jersey and wondering whether there is something in the Constitution that forbids the provision of comprehensible road signs. </p> <p><strong> October 31</strong> <br> Interview with Arthur Miller. Arthur is, incredibly, 84, but he is very energetic, physically and mentally unbowed. A new production of The Price is about to open on Broadway, so he'll have two of his plays running - a total rehabilitation after years of being patronised by the New York critics but being much performed and respected in Britain. </p> <p>This exchange was in the New York Times recently: </p> <p> Critic one : Arthur Miller is celebrated there. </p> <p> Critic two : He's so cynical about American culture and American politics. The English love that. </p> <p>Of course these critics get it wrong on all scores - about the English, who are in thrall to American culture and about Arthur, in whom they mistake disappointment for cynicism. For two hours in his apartment, we film Arthur talking about the past, present and future of American theatre. He tells stories about the first performance of Salesman, of appearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee, of being in London with Marilyn, of copying out speeches of Shakespeare to see how he wrote - all told as if he was recalling them for the first time. </p> <p>After the interview we go to Brooklyn, which is where he used to live (in Brooklyn Heights) and work (in the US navy yard). We walk down to the riverfront to be filmed in the shadow of the pillars of the Brooklyn Bridge looking out over the East river. \"These are our cathedrals,\" says Arthur, looking up at the bridge. \"I thought those were,\" I say, pointing across the river to the business district and the twin towers of the World Trade Centre. \"Oh sure. 'The business of America is business', that's what Calvin Coolidge used to say. He was the first president I can remember.\" Then he stares at the buildings. \"None of them were here when I lived here. Not one. And in all those windows there'll be somebody counting figures. Piling up money.\" Then he smiles ruefully. \"And snorting cocaine, I guess.\" </p> <p><strong> November 1</strong> <br> Sunday. It's very sunny and I'm sitting in my room all day writing Episode five: Brecht and Beckett. \"This is somehow not the right country for me. The people are too strange,\" said Beckett, the only time he visited New York. I know what he meant: I got into the hotel lift this morning with four not-so-young women: \"I love your jacket,\" said one. \"I love your hair,\" said another. \"I love your eyebrows,\" said a third. \"I love you,\" said the fourth. </p> <p><strong> November 2</strong> <br> We drive for an hour or so through a landscape quilted with autumn colours to Tony Kushner's house, a beautiful bottle-green clapboard house on the banks on the Hudson river in New York state, 100 yards from where Washington put a chain across the river to stop the British from getting to New York - now achieved by American Equity. Tony talks with marvellous lucidity and grace about Williams and O'Neill and Miller. </p> <p>His mother, a talented amateur actress, played Linda in Death of a Salesman when Tony was four. He says the play had a powerful effect on him then, so perhaps I should be less sceptical of Freud's love of Shakespeare at the age of eight. \"With Shakespeare's plays,\" says Tony, \"you don't feel trapped while the parade moves in front of you. The parade is there and you're moving around in it and you have room to turn around and that's a great thing to strive for in the sense that a whole world is contained in a play.\" </p> <p>If you run a theatre, you hope for the sort of luck Peter Hall had when Waiting for Godot dropped on his desk at the Arts theatre, or Brendan Behan's The Quare Fellow on Joan Littlewood's; for me it was Tony's play, Angels in America, which seemed Shakespearian in its ambition. It still seems a fearful indictment of New York producers that his play wasn't produced there until after its National Theatre opening. </p> <p>\u0095 The second part of Richard Eyre's Changing Stages is on BBC2 on Sunday at 7.40pm.</p>",

      "byline": "Ian Mayes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This week I have been reviewing the Guardian's coverage of the crisis in the Middle East since the end of September, when Ariel Sharon, the leader of the Likud party in Israel, made his visit to al-Haram al-Sharif, the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. </p> <p>In the weeks of violence and death since then, the paper's coverage has been extensive and wide-ranging, with reports from its own team of correspondents - among whom are Hebrew and Arabic speakers, with at least one who speaks both languages - augmented by opinion pieces from distinguished commentators, for example, the Palestinian American Edward Said and the former prime minister of Israel and Nobel Peace laureate, Shimon Peres. </p> <p>Through this period the paper's editorials have stuck to the same basic position. I paraphrase the writer's summary of it: there is only one peace process, but it is imperfect and requires compromise of a nature that is unsavoury to both sides; if it succeeds, the settlement will be unsatisfactory for both sides but still better than a state of undeclared war. </p> <p>The editor of the paper believes that an impartial comparison with other newspapers, were such a thing possible, might well conclude that the Guardian's coverage was among the best. If that sounds slightly immodest, it might help to know that he made the remark in the context of a conversation about complaints directed at the paper over the past weeks. It has been accused of bias in favour of the Palestinians, bias in favour of the Israelis, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, and lapsing from the paper's liberal traditions and commitment to fair play. Some of the criticism has gone further and questioned the ethnic and religious hinterland of the paper's journalists, a subject to which I shall return briefly - and only briefly - in a moment. </p> <p>Most of this was what might be called background rumbling until the publication on one of the Guardian's comment pages on November 1 of a piece by Jemima Khan headed \"Tell the truth about Israel\". The following oblique identification appeared at the end of the piece: \"Jemima and Imran Khan live in Islamabad.\" There were remarks in this article which were quite understandably construed as anti-semitic. They caused offence not only to a large number of readers but to people inside the paper who also complained. </p> <p>Ms Khan's theme was broadly that pro-Israeli interests, particularly in the US, were disproportionately influential in the Middle East debate to a point that hampered the peace process. Particular offence was caused when she went on from this to say \"The media [in the US] are largely controlled by the Jews, as is Hollywood...\" and later to refer to \"the overwhelming Jewish influence in US politics and the media\". </p> <p>The deputy editor, who saw the article before publication, gave an instruction for a passage which included these remarks to be taken out. Somehow it was left in. Within two days of publication, the letters editor had received about 50 letters condemning the views expressed in the piece. Three were published. </p> <p>Typically, one of the published letters said that statements such as those I have quoted represented \"precisely the kind of view that propagates anti-semitism\". Ms Khan then wrote a letter for publication in which, I am told, she made it clear that her remarks were not intended to be anti-semitic. The letters editor says this was not published because she took the view that Ms Khan had already made her case and she saw no reason to depart from the general rule that the authors of comment pieces then make way for others to respond. </p> <p> Apart from the letters I have mentioned, there were about a dozen more directed to the editor of the paper personally, criticising him for allowing the piece to appear at all. I have seen these letters and the replies sent by or on behalf of the editor. Here, in part, is what the editor said in one of them: \"...I think you are right in saying we should have removed the sentences you quote from Jemima Khan's piece...\" </p> <p>A mistake was made and the editor has acknowledged that.

      "bodyText": "This week I have been reviewing the Guardian's coverage of the crisis in the Middle East since the end of September, when Ariel Sharon, the leader of the Likud party in Israel, made his visit to al-Haram al-Sharif, the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. In the weeks of violence and death since then, the paper's coverage has been extensive and wide-ranging, with reports from its own team of correspondents - among whom are Hebrew and Arabic speakers, with at least one who speaks both languages - augmented by opinion pieces from distinguished commentators, for example, the Palestinian American Edward Said and the former prime minister of Israel and Nobel Peace laureate, Shimon Peres. Through this period the paper's editorials have stuck to the same basic position. I paraphrase the writer's summary of it: there is only one peace process, but it is imperfect and requires compromise of a nature that is unsavoury to both sides; if it succeeds, the settlement will be unsatisfactory for both sides but still better than a state of undeclared war. The editor of the paper believes that an impartial comparison with other newspapers, were such a thing possible, might well conclude that the Guardian's coverage was among the best. If that sounds slightly immodest, it might help to know that he made the remark in the context of a conversation about complaints directed at the paper over the past weeks. It has been accused of bias in favour of the Palestinians, bias in favour of the Israelis, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, and lapsing from the paper's liberal traditions and commitment to fair play. Some of the criticism has gone further and questioned the ethnic and religious hinterland of the paper's journalists, a subject to which I shall return briefly - and only briefly - in a moment. Most of this was what might be called background rumbling until the publication on one of the Guardian's comment pages on November 1 of a piece by Jemima Khan headed \"Tell the truth about Israel\". The following oblique identification appeared at the end of the piece: \"Jemima and Imran Khan live in Islamabad.\" There were remarks in this article which were quite understandably construed as anti-semitic. They caused offence not only to a large number of readers but to people inside the paper who also complained. Ms Khan's theme was broadly that pro-Israeli interests, particularly in the US, were disproportionately influential in the Middle East debate to a point that hampered the peace process. Particular offence was caused when she went on from this to say \"The media [in the US] are largely controlled by the Jews, as is Hollywood...\" and later to refer to \"the overwhelming Jewish influence in US politics and the media\". The deputy editor, who saw the article before publication, gave an instruction for a passage which included these remarks to be taken out. Somehow it was left in. Within two days of publication, the letters editor had received about 50 letters condemning the views expressed in the piece. Three were published. Typically, one of the published letters said that statements such as those I have quoted represented \"precisely the kind of view that propagates anti-semitism\". Ms Khan then wrote a letter for publication in which, I am told, she made it clear that her remarks were not intended to be anti-semitic. The letters editor says this was not published because she took the view that Ms Khan had already made her case and she saw no reason to depart from the general rule that the authors of comment pieces then make way for others to respond. Apart from the letters I have mentioned, there were about a dozen more directed to the editor of the paper personally, criticising him for allowing the piece to appear at all. I have seen these letters and the replies sent by or on behalf of the editor. Here, in part, is what the editor said in one of them: \"...I think you are right in saying we should have removed the sentences you quote from Jemima Khan's piece...\" A mistake was made and the editor has acknowledged that. It is with little more than a forlorn hope that I suggest this should be seen in the context of the paper's overall coverage of the Middle East. The editor said, \"Other than New Labour there is no area where we come under such scrutiny and pressure. To accuse the Guardian of anti-semitism for running a piece by Edward Said [which was part of one complaint] is insulting and an improper kind of pressure.\" On the other matter, the editor said Guardian journalists were employed for their ability. \"We have just appointed a Northern Ireland correspondent and nowhere in the interview process was she asked whether she was a Protestant or a Catholic. I still do not know.\" A respected colleague said, \"Ask me about my work, not my religion or ethnic background.\" All the journalist is asked to do is to tell us about it, without prejudice. \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

Many, like myself, who served under him in the early 1970s, regarded him as one of the best, if not the best, PUSs since the war.</p> <p>The news of his appointment was broken to him by Harold Wilson, with somewhat exaggerated informality, in the gentlemen's lavatory at 10 Downing Street. Greenhill had been George Brown's candidate for the job, partly, it seems, because Brown, then foreign secretary, mistakenly thought that his father had been an engine driver. After Brown had left the scene, the appointment was endorsed - slightly to Greenhill's surprise, but much to his delight - by Brown's successor Michael Stewart.</p> <p>Greenhill had not thought of the foreign service as a career until he was well into his 30s.

      "bodyText": "Lord Greenhill of Harrow, who has died aged 87, was an unusual man, who reached the top of the diplomatic service by an unusual route. In early 1969, as Denis Greenhill, he became permanent under-secretary (PUS) at the Foreign Office and head of the Diplomatic Service, and served under both Labour and Conservative governments until his retirement in 1973. Many, like myself, who served under him in the early 1970s, regarded him as one of the best, if not the best, PUSs since the war. The news of his appointment was broken to him by Harold Wilson, with somewhat exaggerated informality, in the gentlemen's lavatory at 10 Downing Street. Greenhill had been George Brown's candidate for the job, partly, it seems, because Brown, then foreign secretary, mistakenly thought that his father had been an engine driver. After Brown had left the scene, the appointment was endorsed - slightly to Greenhill's surprise, but much to his delight - by Brown's successor Michael Stewart. Greenhill had not thought of the foreign service as a career until he was well into his 30s. His father was a bank manager, and he himself went to Bishop's Stortford College, from which he won a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford. There, he had a respectable, though not brilliant, academic career. However, his years at Oxford opened up for him a wider world of friends and acquaintances, in which his personality might flower. From 1935-39, Greenhill worked in the railways as an executive. He gives an amusing account of these early years in his memoir, More By Accident (1992).

      "body": "<p>Dinner for two? At home? It has that have to have agenda stamped all over it. The temptation to go from beast couchant to lion rampant can prove hard to resist.</p> <p>On that basis, I conjured up images of a marvellously bacchanal dinner - a great tray of ice piled high with native oysters, their flesh wet and glistening, outlined on the white interior of the shell. A chicken cooked gold and crisp without and moist within, the merest brushstroke of pink at the bone. Potatoes, crisped and browned from goose fat, crystals of sea salt glittering in the candlelight. A dish of quails, several partridge and a few squabs pot roasted in butter with a little garlic, the whole lot liberally doused in Armagnac, ready to be rent apart by hands lacquered with juices and devoured in an utterly pagan manner. An ultra-ripe Vacherin Mont d'Or, unashamedly oozing, practically liquid in its box with a great bunch of grapes tumbling out of a basket.</p> <p>The idea of arranging this little snack had me chuckling merrily until I heard the guvnor say, \"Steady the buffs, old boy.\" There just isn't enough glamour, I complained, but surrendered all notions of pagan triumph and thought of autumn instead. It's a favourite season for produce, feathered game and mushrooms aplenty, the first pears, prunes, even rumours of truffles.</p> <p>Although one should entertain wildest fancy now and again, the real treat for a great many people in our fast-paced lives is simply sitting down to a very well cooked dinner, made just for you. Now that is what I really call a luxury of great rarity. Rare, for sure, but not necessarily costly: \u00a315 a head, which was what I was allowed to spend, gives you some latitude for indulgence.</p> <p>To some, mussels appear common, but why they should be regarded so, just because they are reasonably priced and delicious, is a quirk of British taste. More associated with dining out than dining in, there is not so much a lack of respect but of recognition for mussels as a delicacy for home consumption. Considering they take minimal preparation but for a good swill in cold water, any grit being left at the bottom of the pot once the mussels have been opened and dished up, they should be making regular appearances on the domestic table.</p> <p>Tucking into a great big pot of moules cooked in a little onion, a generous slug of white wine, a knob of butter and a wee strew of chopped parsley is simple, delicious and wholly hands on.</p> <p>The native grey-legged partridge (as opposed to the red-legged French partridge) is the most delicious of game birds after the grouse and woodcock. Beyond doubt, one of the very best ways to eat these birds is to roast them for a while, and then to pop them in a pot of braised cabbage, a classic combination. They may be left there for however long you wish. All you have to do is to heat them up for 10 to 15 minutes before eating - not a very serious chore.</p> <p>For pudding, a great fondness for pears leads me to suggest cooking them (if possible, that pearl among pears, the Passe Crassane; if not, a Williams will do) in vin santo. Needless to say there should be a residue of vin santo ready to be chilled and served in a glass along with the pears.</p> <p>To cook at home should be a pleasure not a trial, and time at the table a priority over time in the kitchen. And if the consequences should resemble a scene from Tom Jones, well so much the better.</p> <p>All recipes serve two.</p> <p><b> Moules marnierres</b> Made simply, with the best mussels, this is utterly sublime. <br></p> <p><b> 1kg mussels (40-60) </b></p> <p><b>2 small onions </b></p> <p><b>1 small handful flat-leaf parsley </b></p> <p><b>60ml white wine </b></p> <p><b>60g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and some pepper</b></p> <p>Remove the beards from each mussel, then rinse them under running cold water for 20-30 minutes - a little grit is infinitely preferable to no flavour - and place them in a pan. Peel and finely chop the onion and put in the pan along with the white wine. Place a lid on the pot and set over a high heat. Set a colander within a bowl beside the cooker. Shake the pan regularly. When all the shells have opened, tip the mussels into the colander. Return the pot to the stove and decant the cooking liquor from the strained mussels back into the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil, chop the parsley, then stir this in, along with the butter. Whisk together. Place the mussels into two bowls, pour over the sauce, and serve with crusty bread and an eminent bottle of white wine.</p> <p><b> Roast grey-leg partridge</b><br></p> <p><b> 2 grey-leg partridge </b></p> <p><b>50g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and pepper </b></p> <p><b>Redcurrant jelly </b></p> <p><b>Two bunches watercress </b></p> <p><b>Two thin slices white bread, cut into a disc big enough to comfortably accommodate the bird</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Let the two birds sit for half an hour or so after leaving the fridge - this helps the breasts to cook far better. Cover the birds with butter, and season them. Set them in a suitable roasting pan and place in the hot oven. The birds will take around 18 minutes to roast; baste them every five minutes. They should be pale gold, with a faint rosy blush at the bone. Do not overcook.</p> <p>Remove the birds from the oven and set to one side, though nowhere too warm, and fry the bread in the roasting pan in a little butter until they're crisp and golden, having soaked up the juices. Set the croutons on a plate, and place the birds on top. A little watercress on one side of each bird and some redcurrant jelly in a separate bowl are the sole accompaniments. Let a good Burgundy enhance a meal of sublime simplicity.</p> <p><b> Braised cabbage</b> Alastair Little refuses to serve partridge with anything but braised cabbage. And this is one combination that would be hard to improve on. This dish cooks better in bulk. If you have a nice meat stock handy, then use this instead of the water. <br></p> <p><b> carrot </b></p> <p><b>stick celery </b></p> <p><b>onion </b></p> <p><b>small savoy cabbage </b></p> <p><b>1 rasher streaky bacon </b></p> <p><b>1 tsp duck fat or unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b>1 juniper berry </b></p> <p><b>1 espresso cup water </b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p>Peel and finely chop the carrot, onion and celery. Cut the bacon into thin strips. In a suitable, heavy-based pot, melt the fat or butter and fry the vegetables and bacon until softened. Cut the cabbage into two or four large pieces, place this on top of the cooked vegetables, and press it down lightly. Put in the water (or, preferably, stock), and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and place a lid on the pot. Cook until the steam has softened the cabbage, then add the juniper, crushed, and a little salt and pepper. Raise the heat and reduce any liquid to a teaspoon's worth.</p> <p><b> Pears in vin santo </b> Should vin santo prove rare and expensive, then use a good Marsala. Dinner for two is better served with largesse. <br></p> <p><b> 2 Passe Crassanne pears </b></p> <p><b>2 dssp caster sugar </b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp vin santo </b></p> <p><b>1 vanilla pod </b></p> <p><b>1 very small bayleaf </b></p> <p><b>250g tub mascarpone or, better still, Jersey cream</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Place a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat. Split the pears straight through the core - and the stalk, if possible, as this will make the presentation all the more impressive. With a melon baller, remove the core and any fibrous matter attached, taking care not to dislodge the stalk, if at all possible. Put the sugar into the pan and leave to colour to a caramel in a gentle manner, stirring occasionally, but only starting to do so once the sugar crystals have begun breaking up - this should take five to 10 minutes.</p> <p>Swiftly place the pear halves, cut-side down, in the caramel and pour over the vin santo. Stand back as the sugar may sputter with a furious spit. Drop in the vanilla pod, whole, and bayleaf. Put the pan in the oven, and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the pears.

      "bodyText": "Dinner for two? At home? It has that have to have agenda stamped all over it. The temptation to go from beast couchant to lion rampant can prove hard to resist. On that basis, I conjured up images of a marvellously bacchanal dinner - a great tray of ice piled high with native oysters, their flesh wet and glistening, outlined on the white interior of the shell. A chicken cooked gold and crisp without and moist within, the merest brushstroke of pink at the bone. Potatoes, crisped and browned from goose fat, crystals of sea salt glittering in the candlelight. A dish of quails, several partridge and a few squabs pot roasted in butter with a little garlic, the whole lot liberally doused in Armagnac, ready to be rent apart by hands lacquered with juices and devoured in an utterly pagan manner. An ultra-ripe Vacherin Mont d'Or, unashamedly oozing, practically liquid in its box with a great bunch of grapes tumbling out of a basket. The idea of arranging this little snack had me chuckling merrily until I heard the guvnor say, \"Steady the buffs, old boy.\" There just isn't enough glamour, I complained, but surrendered all notions of pagan triumph and thought of autumn instead. It's a favourite season for produce, feathered game and mushrooms aplenty, the first pears, prunes, even rumours of truffles. Although one should entertain wildest fancy now and again, the real treat for a great many people in our fast-paced lives is simply sitting down to a very well cooked dinner, made just for you. Now that is what I really call a luxury of great rarity. Rare, for sure, but not necessarily costly: \u00a315 a head, which was what I was allowed to spend, gives you some latitude for indulgence. To some, mussels appear common, but why they should be regarded so, just because they are reasonably priced and delicious, is a quirk of British taste. More associated with dining out than dining in, there is not so much a lack of respect but of recognition for mussels as a delicacy for home consumption. Considering they take minimal preparation but for a good swill in cold water, any grit being left at the bottom of the pot once the mussels have been opened and dished up, they should be making regular appearances on the domestic table. Tucking into a great big pot of moules cooked in a little onion, a generous slug of white wine, a knob of butter and a wee strew of chopped parsley is simple, delicious and wholly hands on. The native grey-legged partridge (as opposed to the red-legged French partridge) is the most delicious of game birds after the grouse and woodcock. Beyond doubt, one of the very best ways to eat these birds is to roast them for a while, and then to pop them in a pot of braised cabbage, a classic combination. They may be left there for however long you wish. All you have to do is to heat them up for 10 to 15 minutes before eating - not a very serious chore. For pudding, a great fondness for pears leads me to suggest cooking them (if possible, that pearl among pears, the Passe Crassane; if not, a Williams will do) in vin santo. Needless to say there should be a residue of vin santo ready to be chilled and served in a glass along with the pears. To cook at home should be a pleasure not a trial, and time at the table a priority over time in the kitchen. And if the consequences should resemble a scene from Tom Jones, well so much the better. All recipes serve two. Moules marnierres Made simply, with the best mussels, this is utterly sublime. 1kg mussels (40-60) 2 small onions 1 small handful flat-leaf parsley 60ml white wine 60g unsalted butter Sea salt and some pepper Remove the beards from each mussel, then rinse them under running cold water for 20-30 minutes - a little grit is infinitely preferable to no flavour - and place them in a pan. Peel and finely chop the onion and put in the pan along with the white wine. Place a lid on the pot and set over a high heat. Set a colander within a bowl beside the cooker. Shake the pan regularly. When all the shells have opened, tip the mussels into the colander. Return the pot to the stove and decant the cooking liquor from the strained mussels back into the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil, chop the parsley, then stir this in, along with the butter. Whisk together. Place the mussels into two bowls, pour over the sauce, and serve with crusty bread and an eminent bottle of white wine. Roast grey-leg partridge 2 grey-leg partridge 50g unsalted butter Sea salt and pepper Redcurrant jelly Two bunches watercress Two thin slices white bread, cut into a disc big enough to comfortably accommodate the bird Preheat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Let the two birds sit for half an hour or so after leaving the fridge - this helps the breasts to cook far better. Cover the birds with butter, and season them. Set them in a suitable roasting pan and place in the hot oven. The birds will take around 18 minutes to roast; baste them every five minutes. They should be pale gold, with a faint rosy blush at the bone. Do not overcook. Remove the birds from the oven and set to one side, though nowhere too warm, and fry the bread in the roasting pan in a little butter until they're crisp and golden, having soaked up the juices. Set the croutons on a plate, and place the birds on top. A little watercress on one side of each bird and some redcurrant jelly in a separate bowl are the sole accompaniments. Let a good Burgundy enhance a meal of sublime simplicity. Braised cabbage Alastair Little refuses to serve partridge with anything but braised cabbage. And this is one combination that would be hard to improve on. This dish cooks better in bulk. If you have a nice meat stock handy, then use this instead of the water. carrot stick celery onion small savoy cabbage 1 rasher streaky bacon 1 tsp duck fat or unsalted butter 1 juniper berry 1 espresso cup water Salt and pepper Peel and finely chop the carrot, onion and celery. Cut the bacon into thin strips. In a suitable, heavy-based pot, melt the fat or butter and fry the vegetables and bacon until softened. Cut the cabbage into two or four large pieces, place this on top of the cooked vegetables, and press it down lightly. Put in the water (or, preferably, stock), and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and place a lid on the pot. Cook until the steam has softened the cabbage, then add the juniper, crushed, and a little salt and pepper. Raise the heat and reduce any liquid to a teaspoon's worth. Pears in vin santo Should vin santo prove rare and expensive, then use a good Marsala. Dinner for two is better served with largesse. 2 Passe Crassanne pears 2 dssp caster sugar 4 tbsp vin santo 1 vanilla pod 1 very small bayleaf 250g tub mascarpone or, better still, Jersey cream Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Place a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat. Split the pears straight through the core - and the stalk, if possible, as this will make the presentation all the more impressive. With a melon baller, remove the core and any fibrous matter attached, taking care not to dislodge the stalk, if at all possible. Put the sugar into the pan and leave to colour to a caramel in a gentle manner, stirring occasionally, but only starting to do so once the sugar crystals have begun breaking up - this should take five to 10 minutes. Swiftly place the pear halves, cut-side down, in the caramel and pour over the vin santo. Stand back as the sugar may sputter with a furious spit. Drop in the vanilla pod, whole, and bayleaf. Put the pan in the oven, and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the pears. They are done when they offer little resistance to the touch. Remove from the oven and spoon some of the resulting syrup over the pears. As they are best served only just warm, cook them slightly before dinner. Serve with a spoonful of mascarpone or Jersey cream, with the syrup poured over. \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

      "body": "<p>Jane Russell stood on the far side of her pool, the Arizona mountains making a cowboy-movie backdrop behind her. She pulled in the slack of her kaftan-like dress with one hand behind her back, suddenly showing off that famous Playtex-sponsored bust. Moistening and puckering up her lips, she threw her head back and shouted \"Now!\" I obeyed and released the shutter.</p> <p>I had my picture, but I was a mere technician. She knew the power of the desert sun and at what time of day it would make her look great. She had, as Marlene Dietrich so often did in the Hollywood studios, lit her own portrait. If only it was that easy on every assignment.</p> <p>The modern movie star is no longer tied to one studio like a Greta Garbo or Joan Crawford, whose bosses effectively owned them. The studios built the stars, they ran their lives. When told they had to do a portrait for publicity, the \"talent\" had no choice. Publicity men such as Harry Reichenbach of Metro and Howard Strickling, later at MGM, were more powerful than the director; if they wanted a photograph taken, then the movie had to wait. Nowadays, if a movie is over budget, the first thing that gets cut is the publicity spend. That is why newspapers and magazines make do with copies of duplicates of film stills to illustrate their film reviews and articles - and are the poorer for it. Reichenbach and Strickling must be seething in their graves. Since the collapse of the studio empires following the advent of television, the stars are mainly freelance and often run their own publicity campaigns with the aid of PR people (sometimes helpful to journalists, sometimes not), and they tend only to do interviews and pictures for magazines if they choose to and \"have the time\".</p> <p>Vanity Fair has never had any trouble in lining up the stars it wants. Although based in New York, it has always had Hollywood heroes staring out of its pages. The magazine started up in 1914 at almost the same time as the silent studios and in the 500 issues it has published since has always been seen as the perfect vehicle for exposure. It even has an annual Hollywood Issue, and the Vanity Fair party at the Oscars is the one to be seen at. As Maureen Dowd of the New York Times says, \"Getting your own photo shoot in Vanity Fair is the premier achievement in our celebrity-mad culture.\"</p> <p>Two photographers have dominated the photographic sessions for the magazine, Edward Steichen, the father of portrait photography, and Annie Leibovitz, the mother of invention. They have never taken the \"still\" photographs of the kind that George Hurrell and Clarence Sinclair Bull took on film sets before the war. Bull's first job in Hollywood was in fact to hold the horses in silent westerns, but he went on to photograph Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr and many others. The word \"still\" came about, according to John Kobal, the great fan and collector of early movie photographs, because of the long exposures needed by the early cameras and the fact that the star had to remain perfectly motionless. Ironically the still men were often the most active on the set.</p> <p>The work of the early studio photographers was often very well known, their photographs of stars such as Jean Harlow and Katharine Hepburn were seen all over the world, becoming classics. But the photographers themselves were mostly anonymous - until now, ironically, when their work is treated as art. In the early days, they took their pictures in makeshift studios on the corners of the film sets or actually on the stages, lit by the best cinematographers in the world, hence that \"look\". Later, they moved into elaborately appointed galleries, which the stars had to attend for their photo sessions.</p> <p>The studio photographers must have felt aggrieved when Steichen, the celebrity photographer from New York, swept into town for his shoot for Vanity Fair. He had the run of the lots and the stars did whatever he wanted. Leibovitz has that mantle now; in fact, she's at least as big a star as most of the people she photographs, for she is the star maker. No other photographer has her power and, given the additional clout of Vanity Fair, the stars give her time and carte blanche to do with them whatever she wills. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, long after their drag turn in Some Like It Hot, dressed up in underpants and nightie and held hands in full make-up for her. She constructs and plans her pictures and ordains the pose with an army of assistants, shooting mainly in colour. The results have more in common with the old-style film stills than straightforward portraits: they are perfect moments frozen in time.</p> <p>The famous photograph of Whoopi Goldberg in a bath of milk, taken from above, is a classic. Black woman, white bath, huge fun, brilliant. The photographs are opulent and heroic and everybody always looks exquisite - just what Vanity Fair wants. Only time will tell whether Leibovitz's pictures will last as well as the early Hollywood greats.</p> <p>Newspapers have a rather different agenda from Vanity Fair, and the biggest stars are less ready to be photographed by them. However, Warren Beatty surprised me recently when he agreed, through his army of lawyers and publicists, to do a photograph for our profile page in Saturday Review. I arranged for Robert Yager, a photographer I use in California, to do the job. A Beatty minion insisted that I send him the finished pictures for approval; I reluctantly agreed as I was glad to corral the great man. We were told we could not publish without Mr Beatty's agreement. Time was passing and the thought of having to turn out in an LA court if we published regardless did give me the odd sleepless night.</p> <p>Just as we were sending the picture for printing, Beatty's lawyers were on the phone screaming, \"Do not publish the picture.\" Nobody in LA liked it. Admittedly, the portrait did show a little flesh around the neck nestling on the top of a polo-neck sweater, but it was not bad for a man of 60-odd. As the paper went to press, I had to bluff my way through a few more phone calls from people who claimed to have the say-so. It all went quiet for a few days. Then I heard Warren Beatty loved the portrait - he, of course, had never been shown it during the rows across the Atlantic.</p> <p>There must be something about age, movie stars and high-profile writers, and polo-neck sweaters. A couple of years ago, I went down to Naples to photograph Gore Vidal. He lives 30 miles or so down the coast, reached by the most torturous route you could imagine. I got there car sick and anxious about meeting one of the legendarily tough ones. I made my way through three locked gates and along a path of a quarter of a mile, and there was this great house set in a rock. He opened the door in a baseball jacket and cap. I had my picture. But no - he asked to be excused and came back wearing the most vivid white polo-neck sweater and a blazer. My heart sank. He, too, was worried about his flabby neck and, as a former American footballer, he felt he had got a bit loose around the jowls.</p> <p>Later that evening, we went back through the gates and had a few beers in a bar where no money seemed to pass hands. Then we shared a bottle of Scotch and he became deliciously indiscreet about the Kennedys and Monroe. I wish then I'd had a tape recorder instead of my camera.</p> <p>As a newspaper photographer, I rarely get more than half-an-hour with any star, and I may be the fifth one wheeled in that day to try and get a reaction from someone who is by now bored with the whole thing. The one aim of the studio photographers, given all the time they wanted, was to make their subjects look glamorous, otherwise the publicists would not release the photographs. For me, flattery is not the issue; my aim, like the interviewer's, is to try and show the real person behind the gloss, and I find it helps, creates a dynamic, if they look straight into the camera. As the photographs are rarely taken in people's homes, there are no relevant props; hotel rooms are soulless: the close-up is often the only way out.</p> <p>Jane Bown has always worked for the Observer and she, too, says working for newspapers is different from private commissions. \"I don't have a studio, so each sitting is at a different venue, with a different set of practical problems. My photographs are instinctive - I don't always know how to get it right, but I do know when it feels right. I don't use lights or flash or even a meter - that means I travel light and don't waste time setting up.\"</p> <p>Even when the star has agreed to a photograph, it can still be a relatively unrewarding experience. A couple of years ago, I photographed Juliette Binoche for the Guardian. We met at the Almeida Theatre in Islington and I asked her to pose by some funky-looking brickwork down a stairwell, lit by a convenient spotlight. \"No,\" she said, but agreed that I could photograph her while she was being interviewed over lunch. Grateful for small mercies, I set myself up with a longish lens, so as not to be too intrusive, and started taking a few pictures in between disappearing forkfuls of rocket salad.</p> <p>After a few minutes, I noticed she never looked towards the camera. I left it a few minutes more and interrupted the conversation she was having with the interviewer, and asked her if she could look into the lens for a few shots. \"NO!\" she said. \"You can only photograph me looking at your colleague.\" That's the way it was: I had \"look-away-while-I'm-eating rights\" with Juliette Binoche. It turned out that a Daily Telegraph photographer had been in the day before and he got \"looking-at-the camera-while-I'm-in-a-good-mood\" rights - but not in my stairwell.</p> <p>I am not alone in this club; even the great photographers have their tough days. David Bailey, for example, remembers the actor Tommy Lee Jones arriving at his studio with the usual Hollywood entourage. He sat in the corner without saying a word - he was not going to play ball and Bailey knew it. Bailey said: \"Right, I'm ready.\" Jones stood on his mark in front of the camera; Bailey started clicking, but there was no reaction from Jones. \"What now?\" asked Jones. Bailey replied, \"Knock yourself out some more!\" Tommy Lee smiled and Bailey got the picture. The shoot was over.</p> <p>Oliver Stone, the film director, marched into Bailey's studio, passing a rail of jackets on hangers, and made his position clear: \"I am not a fashion model and won't wear silly clothes.\" (Something Bailey has never done with portraits, by the way.) He turned to Bailey: \"I hear you are as quick as Avedon.\" Bailey, sharp as ever, replied, \"Yeah . . . quicker, but maybe not as good.\" Stone sat in front of the camera, Bailey clicked once: \"Right, got it.\" Stone, taken by surprise, said, \"Oh, I've got a bit more time than that\", was won over and stayed for hours, eventually leaving wearing the clothes provided by the magazine which commissioned the shot.</p> <p>I had problems of a different sort with Michael Winner. The interviewer and I arrived at his plush house in Holland Park and were shown around his private cinema and his amazing bedroom, featuring a huge bed on a raised platform, a kind of bachelor seduction special from the 70s; but it was the Hollywood-style staircase that was lit like a dream by some huge windows that gave me some hope.</p> <p>Winner complied, simply requesting that I shoot him from above his eyeline. Well, he's the great director, I thought, there must be something in it. We moved up and down the stairs, I got a few shots, and then he started yelling at me: \"Above my eyeline.\" \"Oh sorry,\" I muttered, \"tripod must have slipped.\" \"No it hasn't,\" he yelped. \"You've deliberately gone below my eyeline.\"</p> <p>I knew I hadn't, but he was having none of it. I spent the next 20 minutes high above him, straining over my camera with tripod legs akimbo, getting pictures of the top of his head. He was happy, but I got absolutely nothing.</p> <p>Drink seems to be one of the best ways of creating a relaxed atmosphere before shooting some stars. Steve Pyke, best-known for his extreme close-ups, is interested in the landscape of the human face; like Bailey, he never uses the sitter's hands in his pictures. He recalls getting to Paris early one morning to photograph Roman Polanski. \"I got to this very plush restaurant that Polanski uses at about eight o'clock and was asked if I fancied a drink - I don't know why, but red wine seemed the perfect thing, even at that hour. Soon after, the great man arrives and I think to myself, this doesn't look very good. He notices my glass and says, 'Ah! you drink the same blood as me.'\" Pyke got some great stuff that day.</p> <p>Pete Postlethwaite: now there's a name, and what a star. He didn't mind what I did, close up, wide angle, pictures of him smoking, drinking, laughing, looking tough, anything. But then, with a face like that, I guess he works on the principle, nobody could do it any harm. The first thing he said to me was \"Do you fancy a drink?\"</p> <p>Sometimes, no drink, no joke, nothing will help. Oskar Werner, who starred in Jules et Jim with Jeanne Moreau, was one movie star Bailey never got a picture of. Werner arrived at the studio and immediately complained about the pop music that an assistant had put on; he demanded Bach. There was none in the studio, but some other classical music was found. When asked to sit on the stool, Werner, like Stone, said he was no fashion model: \"You can't tell me what to do.\"</p> <p>\"I think we had better forget the picture,\" was Bailey's reply, and Mr Werner left.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jane Russell stood on the far side of her pool, the Arizona mountains making a cowboy-movie backdrop behind her. She pulled in the slack of her kaftan-like dress with one hand behind her back, suddenly showing off that famous Playtex-sponsored bust. Moistening and puckering up her lips, she threw her head back and shouted \"Now!\" I obeyed and released the shutter. I had my picture, but I was a mere technician. She knew the power of the desert sun and at what time of day it would make her look great. She had, as Marlene Dietrich so often did in the Hollywood studios, lit her own portrait. If only it was that easy on every assignment. The modern movie star is no longer tied to one studio like a Greta Garbo or Joan Crawford, whose bosses effectively owned them. The studios built the stars, they ran their lives. When told they had to do a portrait for publicity, the \"talent\" had no choice. Publicity men such as Harry Reichenbach of Metro and Howard Strickling, later at MGM, were more powerful than the director; if they wanted a photograph taken, then the movie had to wait. Nowadays, if a movie is over budget, the first thing that gets cut is the publicity spend. That is why newspapers and magazines make do with copies of duplicates of film stills to illustrate their film reviews and articles - and are the poorer for it. Reichenbach and Strickling must be seething in their graves. Since the collapse of the studio empires following the advent of television, the stars are mainly freelance and often run their own publicity campaigns with the aid of PR people (sometimes helpful to journalists, sometimes not), and they tend only to do interviews and pictures for magazines if they choose to and \"have the time\". Vanity Fair has never had any trouble in lining up the stars it wants. Although based in New York, it has always had Hollywood heroes staring out of its pages. The magazine started up in 1914 at almost the same time as the silent studios and in the 500 issues it has published since has always been seen as the perfect vehicle for exposure. It even has an annual Hollywood Issue, and the Vanity Fair party at the Oscars is the one to be seen at. As Maureen Dowd of the New York Times says, \"Getting your own photo shoot in Vanity Fair is the premier achievement in our celebrity-mad culture.\" Two photographers have dominated the photographic sessions for the magazine, Edward Steichen, the father of portrait photography, and Annie Leibovitz, the mother of invention. They have never taken the \"still\" photographs of the kind that George Hurrell and Clarence Sinclair Bull took on film sets before the war. Bull's first job in Hollywood was in fact to hold the horses in silent westerns, but he went on to photograph Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr and many others. The word \"still\" came about, according to John Kobal, the great fan and collector of early movie photographs, because of the long exposures needed by the early cameras and the fact that the star had to remain perfectly motionless. Ironically the still men were often the most active on the set. The work of the early studio photographers was often very well known, their photographs of stars such as Jean Harlow and Katharine Hepburn were seen all over the world, becoming classics. But the photographers themselves were mostly anonymous - until now, ironically, when their work is treated as art. In the early days, they took their pictures in makeshift studios on the corners of the film sets or actually on the stages, lit by the best cinematographers in the world, hence that \"look\". Later, they moved into elaborately appointed galleries, which the stars had to attend for their photo sessions. The studio photographers must have felt aggrieved when Steichen, the celebrity photographer from New York, swept into town for his shoot for Vanity Fair. He had the run of the lots and the stars did whatever he wanted. Leibovitz has that mantle now; in fact, she's at least as big a star as most of the people she photographs, for she is the star maker. No other photographer has her power and, given the additional clout of Vanity Fair, the stars give her time and carte blanche to do with them whatever she wills. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, long after their drag turn in Some Like It Hot, dressed up in underpants and nightie and held hands in full make-up for her. She constructs and plans her pictures and ordains the pose with an army of assistants, shooting mainly in colour. The results have more in common with the old-style film stills than straightforward portraits: they are perfect moments frozen in time. The famous photograph of Whoopi Goldberg in a bath of milk, taken from above, is a classic. Black woman, white bath, huge fun, brilliant. The photographs are opulent and heroic and everybody always looks exquisite - just what Vanity Fair wants. Only time will tell whether Leibovitz's pictures will last as well as the early Hollywood greats. Newspapers have a rather different agenda from Vanity Fair, and the biggest stars are less ready to be photographed by them. However, Warren Beatty surprised me recently when he agreed, through his army of lawyers and publicists, to do a photograph for our profile page in Saturday Review. I arranged for Robert Yager, a photographer I use in California, to do the job. A Beatty minion insisted that I send him the finished pictures for approval; I reluctantly agreed as I was glad to corral the great man. We were told we could not publish without Mr Beatty's agreement. Time was passing and the thought of having to turn out in an LA court if we published regardless did give me the odd sleepless night. Just as we were sending the picture for printing, Beatty's lawyers were on the phone screaming, \"Do not publish the picture.\" Nobody in LA liked it. Admittedly, the portrait did show a little flesh around the neck nestling on the top of a polo-neck sweater, but it was not bad for a man of 60-odd. As the paper went to press, I had to bluff my way through a few more phone calls from people who claimed to have the say-so. It all went quiet for a few days. Then I heard Warren Beatty loved the portrait - he, of course, had never been shown it during the rows across the Atlantic. There must be something about age, movie stars and high-profile writers, and polo-neck sweaters. A couple of years ago, I went down to Naples to photograph Gore Vidal. He lives 30 miles or so down the coast, reached by the most torturous route you could imagine. I got there car sick and anxious about meeting one of the legendarily tough ones. I made my way through three locked gates and along a path of a quarter of a mile, and there was this great house set in a rock. He opened the door in a baseball jacket and cap. I had my picture. But no - he asked to be excused and came back wearing the most vivid white polo-neck sweater and a blazer. My heart sank. He, too, was worried about his flabby neck and, as a former American footballer, he felt he had got a bit loose around the jowls. Later that evening, we went back through the gates and had a few beers in a bar where no money seemed to pass hands. Then we shared a bottle of Scotch and he became deliciously indiscreet about the Kennedys and Monroe. I wish then I'd had a tape recorder instead of my camera. As a newspaper photographer, I rarely get more than half-an-hour with any star, and I may be the fifth one wheeled in that day to try and get a reaction from someone who is by now bored with the whole thing. The one aim of the studio photographers, given all the time they wanted, was to make their subjects look glamorous, otherwise the publicists would not release the photographs. For me, flattery is not the issue; my aim, like the interviewer's, is to try and show the real person behind the gloss, and I find it helps, creates a dynamic, if they look straight into the camera. As the photographs are rarely taken in people's homes, there are no relevant props; hotel rooms are soulless: the close-up is often the only way out. Jane Bown has always worked for the Observer and she, too, says working for newspapers is different from private commissions. \"I don't have a studio, so each sitting is at a different venue, with a different set of practical problems. My photographs are instinctive - I don't always know how to get it right, but I do know when it feels right. I don't use lights or flash or even a meter - that means I travel light and don't waste time setting up.\" Even when the star has agreed to a photograph, it can still be a relatively unrewarding experience. A couple of years ago, I photographed Juliette Binoche for the Guardian. We met at the Almeida Theatre in Islington and I asked her to pose by some funky-looking brickwork down a stairwell, lit by a convenient spotlight. \"No,\" she said, but agreed that I could photograph her while she was being interviewed over lunch. Grateful for small mercies, I set myself up with a longish lens, so as not to be too intrusive, and started taking a few pictures in between disappearing forkfuls of rocket salad. After a few minutes, I noticed she never looked towards the camera. I left it a few minutes more and interrupted the conversation she was having with the interviewer, and asked her if she could look into the lens for a few shots. \"NO!\" she said. \"You can only photograph me looking at your colleague.\" That's the way it was: I had \"look-away-while-I'm-eating rights\" with Juliette Binoche. It turned out that a Daily Telegraph photographer had been in the day before and he got \"looking-at-the camera-while-I'm-in-a-good-mood\" rights - but not in my stairwell. I am not alone in this club; even the great photographers have their tough days. David Bailey, for example, remembers the actor Tommy Lee Jones arriving at his studio with the usual Hollywood entourage. He sat in the corner without saying a word - he was not going to play ball and Bailey knew it. Bailey said: \"Right, I'm ready.\" Jones stood on his mark in front of the camera; Bailey started clicking, but there was no reaction from Jones. \"What now?\" asked Jones. Bailey replied, \"Knock yourself out some more!\" Tommy Lee smiled and Bailey got the picture. The shoot was over. Oliver Stone, the film director, marched into Bailey's studio, passing a rail of jackets on hangers, and made his position clear: \"I am not a fashion model and won't wear silly clothes.\" (Something Bailey has never done with portraits, by the way.) He turned to Bailey: \"I hear you are as quick as Avedon.\" Bailey, sharp as ever, replied, \"Yeah . . . quicker, but maybe not as good.\" Stone sat in front of the camera, Bailey clicked once: \"Right, got it.\" Stone, taken by surprise, said, \"Oh, I've got a bit more time than that\", was won over and stayed for hours, eventually leaving wearing the clothes provided by the magazine which commissioned the shot. I had problems of a different sort with Michael Winner. The interviewer and I arrived at his plush house in Holland Park and were shown around his private cinema and his amazing bedroom, featuring a huge bed on a raised platform, a kind of bachelor seduction special from the 70s; but it was the Hollywood-style staircase that was lit like a dream by some huge windows that gave me some hope. Winner complied, simply requesting that I shoot him from above his eyeline. Well, he's the great director, I thought, there must be something in it. We moved up and down the stairs, I got a few shots, and then he started yelling at me: \"Above my eyeline.\" \"Oh sorry,\" I muttered, \"tripod must have slipped.\" \"No it hasn't,\" he yelped. \"You've deliberately gone below my eyeline.\" I knew I hadn't, but he was having none of it. I spent the next 20 minutes high above him, straining over my camera with tripod legs akimbo, getting pictures of the top of his head. He was happy, but I got absolutely nothing. Drink seems to be one of the best ways of creating a relaxed atmosphere before shooting some stars. Steve Pyke, best-known for his extreme close-ups, is interested in the landscape of the human face; like Bailey, he never uses the sitter's hands in his pictures. He recalls getting to Paris early one morning to photograph Roman Polanski. \"I got to this very plush restaurant that Polanski uses at about eight o'clock and was asked if I fancied a drink - I don't know why, but red wine seemed the perfect thing, even at that hour. Soon after, the great man arrives and I think to myself, this doesn't look very good. He notices my glass and says, 'Ah! you drink the same blood as me.'\" Pyke got some great stuff that day. Pete Postlethwaite: now there's a name, and what a star. He didn't mind what I did, close up, wide angle, pictures of him smoking, drinking, laughing, looking tough, anything. But then, with a face like that, I guess he works on the principle, nobody could do it any harm. The first thing he said to me was \"Do you fancy a drink?\" Sometimes, no drink, no joke, nothing will help. Oskar Werner, who starred in Jules et Jim with Jeanne Moreau, was one movie star Bailey never got a picture of. Werner arrived at the studio and immediately complained about the pop music that an assistant had put on; he demanded Bach. There was none in the studio, but some other classical music was found. When asked to sit on the stool, Werner, like Stone, said he was no fashion model: \"You can't tell me what to do.\" \"I think we had better forget the picture,\" was Bailey's reply, and Mr Werner left.",

GATS unleashes transnational corporations to roam the planet and buy up any public services they fancy. Everything from hospitals, post offices and libraries to water and education. Any electorates who try and hang on to these services will get slapped with non-negotiable trade sanctions until their economy screams.</p> <p>Leaked WTO documents show them currently working out a list of what will be acceptable as a \"legitimate\" government objective for any regulation of services under GATS. That of \"safeguarding the public interest\" has already been rejected. If GATS goes ahead, warns economist Susan George, \"then Europe can kiss goodbye its public health services\". But even though that's just the start of the disaster, there has been no parliamentary debate or news coverage about GATS. (It's way too important for that.) The British government's official line is that there's nothing to worry about anyway. The DTI claims GATS won't apply to the NHS or education here because \"non-commercial services\" are exempt from the fiat .

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for example, locks Mexico into neo-liberal reforms in order to protect profits from what NAFTA's planners termed \"the danger of a 'democracy opening' in Mexico\". IMF Structural Adjustment Programmes, written in Washington, lock developing countries into \"liberalisation\" policies over and against the wishes of their own people.

Don't. With its 200-year pedigree, it's one of Europe's little-known food treasures, still made by endearingly traditional methods. </p> <p>An oil with a stunning flavour, full of health-promoting nutrients, pumpkinseed oil is also beautiful stuff to look at. In the bottle it looks black. Against the background of a white plate the first droplets look deep red, but as the oil spreads more thinly, it displays a bright limey-green hue at the edges. The flavour is compulsive, deeply nutty with an engaging wholefoodie quality to it, like eating ultra-fresh, lightly toasted pumpkin seeds. If you're looking for a natural product with the original \"good mouth feel\", then this is it: buttery, viscous and exceptionally unctuous. </p> <p>Although pumpkinseed oil is also produced in Slovenia, Yugoslavia and Hungary, it is Austria's pride and joy. (You can get it in the UK under the Merchant Gourmet label, \u00a33.99 for 250ml, in Sainsbury's Special Selection or Waitrose. Tesco is stocking it from mid-December). Step into any quality food shop in Austria though, and you can expect to see an entire display of what's been dubbed locally \"the black-gold of the green region\", the latter being Styria, the verdant eastern province of Austria. The oil comes from Cucurbita pepo, also known as \"the naked-seed pumpkin\", a variety unique to central and eastern Europe. It differs from other pumpkins in that it is grown not for flesh but for seeds. These have only a thin edible membrane, not a woody outer hull, so they are entirely edible. First they are dried, very lightly roasted, then cold-pressed. It takes about five pumpkins to yield one litre of oil. All the Styrian oil comes from small-scale, artisanal producers sharing some 70 communal mills, and much of it is organic. </p> <p>The health profile of pumpkinseed oil is impressive. Not only does it have a high content of unsaturated fats, it is also rich in vitamin E and useful but sometimes elusive minerals such as selenium (both thought to be protective against heart disease and some cancers). It's loaded, too, with zinc, which, in combination with vitamin E, helps fertility. In Austria, pumpkinseed oil is also used medicinally to boost the immune system and treat enlarged prostrate. Pumpkin seeds have been shown to relieve bladder and urinary problems, too. </p> <p>The classic way to use pumpkinseed oil on its home turf is as a dressing for brawn. That may sound revolting, but it can be excellent, especially in the hands of a top chef such as Helmut Osterreicher in Vienna, whose celebrated restaurant Steirereck (Styrian Corner) serves shin of slowly-boiled Styrian beef set in a light jelly made from reduced stock, surrounded with fresh herbs, light vinegar and a drizzling of the fascinating oil. </p> <p>Increasingly, however, Austrians use it as a salad dressing and like to partner it with apfel (cider) vinegar. Trendy Austrian chefs are now using it as a subtler alternative to sesame oil, teaming it up with Asian ingredients such as glass noodles and soy. Pumpkinseed oil will burn if heated and lose its beneficial nutritional properties, so it's used cold and stored in the fridge. Its big, rounded personality means that you use it sparingly. It has an affinity with peppery greens (watercress, rocket, mustard greens), baby spinach, and bitter leaves such as endive. Both balsamic and cider vinegar are natural partners, but it can stand up to broad-shouldered sherry vinegar, too. Complimentary add-ins might include crumbled feta or Roquefort, toasted pumpkin seeds or pine kernels, and freshly cracked nuts or something sweet, such as pears or beetroot. Try it.</p>",

This is a deliciously dry Spanish bubbly with deftly interwoven fruit and acid rating 15.5 points out of 20. Frankly, if I was throwing a New Year's eve (new millennium's eve, by Jove!) party for a large rabble then I would stock up on this bargain immediately. While we're in the store, I should also draw your attention to Tesco's nonvintage Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon (16 points, \u00a33.49) which is another thumping great bargain. It offers chocolate with raspberry, a hint of earth and blackcurrant on the finish. This really is a terrific wine to be liberal with when entertaining. </p> <p>Tesco also has various other wines on offer until November 29. Australian Brown Brothers Dry Muscat 1999 (15 points, down to \u00a34.49) is lemon sherberty, yet dry, with a hint of ripe muscat grapes on a finish which is slightly exotic and spicy. This is a delicious aperitif wine. Also from Australia is Hardys Stamp Chardonnay Semillon 1999 (15 points, on offer at \u00a33.49) which has a very gentle toffeed edge, almost like butterscotch, along with compensating lemony acids. Rosemount Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (15 points, down to \u00a34.99) is deliciously ripe yet fresh with that tight sauvignon tang of minerals and gooseberries. There's an echo of lime in there, too. Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1999 (16 points, on offer for \u00a33.99) has a hint of coffee and cream to the blackcurrant as it quits the throat. Corbieres Reserve La Sansoure 1999 (15 points, now \u00a33.99) is soft with ripe fruit. And Oxford Landing Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 1999 (15.5 points, down to \u00a34.49), from Australia, shows a rich texture, good layers of fruit, warm friendly tannins, and overall a lushly impactful structure which is ripe without being raucous. It s an adult Shiraz of great charm and persistence. Other discounted wines worth their weight at Tesco are two Aussie reds. Banrock Station Shiraz/ Mataro 1999 (15 points, buy six for \u00a319, which runs out at around \u00a33.17 per bottle) is juicy and ripe and richly textured, not very subtle, but a superb performer with Middle Eastern food, one reason being that it has a touch of coriander to it. Rosemount Estate Shiraz Cabernet 1999 (15.5 points, buy six for \u00a332.49, or \u00a35.42 a bottle) is hugely friendly, an archetypical Aussie Shiraz that defines what this grape means at this price for so many drinkers. </p> <p>Tesco has some special-occasion wines, not on offer, that you might like to bear in mind for any festivities ahead. Valdivieso Cabernet Franc Reserve 1998 (17 points, \u00a38.99), from Chile, has deep savoury riches which tantalise the tongue and tighten the throat as the tannins ooze down. Thelema Mountain Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (17 points, \u00a312.99), from South Africa, offers a perfect herbaceous undertone to beautifully multi- layered fruit of luxury and quiet charm. Montes Alpha Chardonnay 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a39.99) from Chile is a marvellously couth, great burgundy-style chardonnay with creamy textured richness of some sensuality. Kumala Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a38.99), from South Africa, is compellingly well concentrated and classy with great generosity of fruit. </p> <p>If anyone can upstage Tesco's cheaper wines, it is Angie's Bargain Basement (vulgarly known as Somerfield, whose wine buyer, Angela Mount, is a cut-price genius). Her current descents into toothsome absurdity include a vintage 2000 South African Dry White (15 points, \u00a31.99 until November 14), Domaine du Bois Viognier 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49 until November 28), Domaine St Agathe Chardonnay 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.29 until November 28), and Vina Cana Rioja Crianza 1997 (16 points, \u00a33.49, also until November 28). Each is incredible value for money; balanced, sanely fruity, and highly quaffable. The Cape white is a conventional melon and lemon duo. The viognier, an increasingly chic white grape, is dry and subtly peachy. The St Agathe (horrifically martyred by mammalian section, you will recall) is remarkably elegant and gently buttery. The red rioja is lovely, with a hint of milk chocolate softening the tannins.</p>",

Her current descents into toothsome absurdity include a vintage 2000 South African Dry White (15 points, \u00a31.99 until November 14), Domaine du Bois Viognier 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49 until November 28), Domaine St Agathe Chardonnay 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.29 until November 28), and Vina Cana Rioja Crianza 1997 (16 points, \u00a33.49, also until November 28). Each is incredible value for money; balanced, sanely fruity, and highly quaffable. The Cape white is a conventional melon and lemon duo. The viognier, an increasingly chic white grape, is dry and subtly peachy. The St Agathe (horrifically martyred by mammalian section, you will recall) is remarkably elegant and gently buttery. The red rioja is lovely, with a hint of milk chocolate softening the tannins.",

      "body": "<p>'Dulcie? This is Fred. I was wondering if you might fancy a weekend in St Ives?\" At last he rings with an invitation. So he does want to see me after all. One can never tell with middle-aged, once-married bisexuals. My heart gives a little skip. But to tell you the truth, my erotic anticipation is already fixed elsewhere - on Aunt Elspeth's gift of a cheque, at present reposing in an envelope in my cardigan pocket. Unopened.</p> <p>\"I thought,\" Fred goes on, \"you might like the paradox of being in St Ives at the darkest time of the year.\" There he goes again, wooing me with attractive concepts beginning with P. The very first time he spoke to me, at the gay barbecue, he distracted me with poignancy. Now it's paradoxes.</p> <p>And yet - the real paradox is, now I've got my bulging envelope, its exact contents as yet a mystery, I can't be quite so easily fobbed off with mere words, even those beginning with P. Although I am aware - poignantly, perhaps - that in my previous poverty a delight in words and concepts offered a pleasure of unsullied purity, I'm happy to postpone the pleasure of further p-words while I give in to galloping greed and drool over my patrimony. Or perhaps, since it's the aunt's, it should be antimony.</p> <p>It's not that I am indifferent to a weekend with Fred, it's just that I have not yet made the night wanton with my cheque. And size may not be important in bed, but in the bank account it's crucial. I have been in a feverish conjecture about the size of aunt's cheque since she presented me with the sealed envelope, which, though it was only about 20 minutes ago, seems somehow more like a fortnight.</p> <p>\"Mum?\" Harriet bounces up, ignoring my phone call. \"Should I wash my turquoise socks with the whites or the darks?\"</p> <p>\"Turquoise is neither of the whites nor of the darks,\" I pontificate, suddenly authoritative in aesthetics where previously I would flounder and flap. The Newlyn School, here I come. \"If in doubt, select synthetics. Sorry, Fred, that was Harriet. She sends her love.\" Harriet departs with a raised eyebrow.</p> <p>\"Oh, give her mine. But, Dulcie - this time I'd rather we left the teenagers out of it, if you don't mind.\"</p> <p>\"Oh quite.\" Become aware that aunt is hovering and listening in hall, and Ex-spouse in dining room. How easily, by some injudicious remark, I could slide from sainthood to tarthood. Though I think the aunt understands instinctively that Ex-spouse and I are not in any sense an item nowadays, she could easily turn to granite were I to flaunt a peccadillo.</p> <p>\"Oh, I'd love to meet your mother, Fred,\" I suddenly launch into fiction. \"And your new boyfriend. Giorgio! What a lovely name!\"</p> <p>\"Ah, so we've got an audience,\" purrs Fred. \"Would you like me to talk dirty to you? I long to plunge into your marshmallow thighs, etcetera? I'm dying to make the beast with two backs whilst the sea roars beneath our window.\" Just as long as it's below the window. I didn't like that programme about tsunamis. Maybe we should make the beast with two backs on the summit of Mount Ararat.</p> <p>But to be honest, the business of sex, which so preoccupied my younger years, now seems but the bizarre juxtaposition of charcuterie. At least compared with the urgent attractions of my throbbing envelope. But marshmallow thighs? I know it's in a Kate Bush song, but it's in that grey area between compliment and insult, surely?</p> <p>\"Mum! Where do I put the Comfort?\" Ring off having promised to spend next weekend with my lover, initiate Harriet into the mysteries of the Comfort-disposing drawer, then escape to the bathroom, rip open envelope, and discover to my amazement that the aunt has given me \u00a350,000.

      "bodyText": "'Dulcie? This is Fred. I was wondering if you might fancy a weekend in St Ives?\" At last he rings with an invitation. So he does want to see me after all. One can never tell with middle-aged, once-married bisexuals. My heart gives a little skip. But to tell you the truth, my erotic anticipation is already fixed elsewhere - on Aunt Elspeth's gift of a cheque, at present reposing in an envelope in my cardigan pocket. Unopened. \"I thought,\" Fred goes on, \"you might like the paradox of being in St Ives at the darkest time of the year.\" There he goes again, wooing me with attractive concepts beginning with P. The very first time he spoke to me, at the gay barbecue, he distracted me with poignancy. Now it's paradoxes. And yet - the real paradox is, now I've got my bulging envelope, its exact contents as yet a mystery, I can't be quite so easily fobbed off with mere words, even those beginning with P. Although I am aware - poignantly, perhaps - that in my previous poverty a delight in words and concepts offered a pleasure of unsullied purity, I'm happy to postpone the pleasure of further p-words while I give in to galloping greed and drool over my patrimony. Or perhaps, since it's the aunt's, it should be antimony. It's not that I am indifferent to a weekend with Fred, it's just that I have not yet made the night wanton with my cheque. And size may not be important in bed, but in the bank account it's crucial. I have been in a feverish conjecture about the size of aunt's cheque since she presented me with the sealed envelope, which, though it was only about 20 minutes ago, seems somehow more like a fortnight. \"Mum?\" Harriet bounces up, ignoring my phone call. \"Should I wash my turquoise socks with the whites or the darks?\" \"Turquoise is neither of the whites nor of the darks,\" I pontificate, suddenly authoritative in aesthetics where previously I would flounder and flap. The Newlyn School, here I come. \"If in doubt, select synthetics. Sorry, Fred, that was Harriet. She sends her love.\" Harriet departs with a raised eyebrow. \"Oh, give her mine. But, Dulcie - this time I'd rather we left the teenagers out of it, if you don't mind.\" \"Oh quite.\" Become aware that aunt is hovering and listening in hall, and Ex-spouse in dining room. How easily, by some injudicious remark, I could slide from sainthood to tarthood. Though I think the aunt understands instinctively that Ex-spouse and I are not in any sense an item nowadays, she could easily turn to granite were I to flaunt a peccadillo. \"Oh, I'd love to meet your mother, Fred,\" I suddenly launch into fiction. \"And your new boyfriend. Giorgio! What a lovely name!\" \"Ah, so we've got an audience,\" purrs Fred. \"Would you like me to talk dirty to you? I long to plunge into your marshmallow thighs, etcetera? I'm dying to make the beast with two backs whilst the sea roars beneath our window.\" Just as long as it's below the window. I didn't like that programme about tsunamis. Maybe we should make the beast with two backs on the summit of Mount Ararat. But to be honest, the business of sex, which so preoccupied my younger years, now seems but the bizarre juxtaposition of charcuterie. At least compared with the urgent attractions of my throbbing envelope. But marshmallow thighs? I know it's in a Kate Bush song, but it's in that grey area between compliment and insult, surely? \"Mum! Where do I put the Comfort?\" Ring off having promised to spend next weekend with my lover, initiate Harriet into the mysteries of the Comfort-disposing drawer, then escape to the bathroom, rip open envelope, and discover to my amazement that the aunt has given me \u00a350,000. Enough for a house in the Languedoc and some discreet thigh restructuring. A comfort-dispensing envelope if ever I had one. Am still reeling when there is a knock on the bathroom door. \"Dulcie, dearr? I'm sorry to disturrb you, but I think I can smell something unusual in my wardrobe.\" \"Coming, Auntie!\" I may have got the poverty and chastity licked but I think I might have a bit more of a problem with the obedience.",

Perhaps this is because digging away at the sticky earth and piling in the manure allows for solitary contemplation, but one driven with a clear creative purpose. The community here is polyglot, and something of the plot-holders' cultural origins can be traced in the plants they choose to grow: Greeks, Cypriots, Italians and the Portuguese go for the garlic, leeks, red onions, tomatoes, sweet corn, runner beans and strawberries. The Greeks like to grow their beans up a single pole, while the rest use the grouping method. The English and Irish display a fondness for potatoes, while an Indian allotment keeper has gone for herbs, big time.</p> <p>While the majority of the gardeners are men, there are more than 40 women among them, and you will find people working their allotments early in the morning before work and first thing in the evening, although the weekends are understandably when things are at their busiest. Some of them put their best fruit and veg into large local horticultural shows, such as the one held at Friern Barnet during the summer months. The Golders Green Association members regularly win first prizes in their selected category.</p> <p>The shows are now over, but the work does not stop. There's the smell of bonfires in the air as rows of bean sticks, tomato stakes, trimmings from fruit bushes and blighted plants ,or those too woody to compost, are cleared out of the way. The more organised plot-holders are digging and manuring the soil for next spring, and staking out dead-straight seed drills with string and pegs for winter plantings. Autumn is when garlic cloves go in the ground, as well as tulip bulbs, broad beans and peas. Herbs and young sweet peas are moved under glass and the allotment version of plant protection comes into its own - cold frames made from old windows, ancient cloches of panes of glass held together with clips, or rows of cut-off plastic bottles.</p> <p>Vegetation is rotting after recent rain, making a muddy backdrop for pumpkins and squash, the last cobs of sweetcorn and a spattering of reddening apples on a small tree. It's the time of year when plot-holders scale down, and maybe take their last chance to earth up Brussels sprouts, protect cauliflower curds from frost, and mulch rhubarb and globe artichoke crowns before the weather gets too cold and uninviting.</p> <p>Thanks to good organisation, the allotment keepers of Golders Green escaped the worst of the recent storms, the rain being channelled away. \"Over the last three or four years, we've been renewing the earth drains, so we haven't had any problems,\" says Mr Wingate.</p> <p>For all their individual shyness to a stranger with a notebook, the allotment keepers display an obvious companionship between themselves. Husband and wife team Donato and Carmen Sabatino manage two plots side by side. Donato left the family farm back in Italy to pursue a different career path, but, he says, \"as soon as I saw the allotments I knew I had to have one\".</p> <p>Relative newcomers, Chinese couple the Hys only started work on their allotment in the past year. In between putting up their greenhouse, they have already had a harvest of pak choi and other oriental vegetables. Next door to the Hys, a middle-aged English couple sit in their greenhouse, clad in Wellies and padded jackets, eating a salad lunch out of plastic boxes. They explain how they live on the seventh floor of a council block in Swiss Cottage. \"This allotment is our garden, it's where we escape to.\" They talk excitedly of watching foxes and water rats while they work.</p> <p>Eli Bagdady, an Israeli truck driver, drove past the allotments several years ago, fell in love with the place and immediately secured himself a plot. He's erected a slightly alarming-looking Swiss chalet-style shed at one end of his allotment, complete with lacy curtains, plant pots and even a barbecue. A former worker on a kibbutz, he identifies closely with the communal ethic and is a passionate grower of a huge range of vegetables and fruit. \"It's the taste that makes all the difference,\" he says.</p> <p>In summer, he says, he doesn't need to buy vegetables from the supermarket. While he and many of his allotments colleagues very occasionally use a pesticide when necessity demands it, most of the food is grown using organic methods. \"I challenge you to eat something grown here with something from Tesco's and not tell the difference immediately.\"</p> <p>Looking around at the ramshackle buildings, it's hard not to compare the openness of allotment culture, the way the jerry-built sheds have no locks, with the prim toy-town neatness of the suburban garden shed. Then you get a sense of how oddly repressive the latter can be. Keeping an allotment may not be everybody's cup of tea, but, as Eli states with passion, the allotments are \"a kind of paradise, somewhere you can escape from reality. It's better than going to the doctor.\"</p>",

Vegetation is rotting after recent rain, making a muddy backdrop for pumpkins and squash, the last cobs of sweetcorn and a spattering of reddening apples on a small tree. It's the time of year when plot-holders scale down, and maybe take their last chance to earth up Brussels sprouts, protect cauliflower curds from frost, and mulch rhubarb and globe artichoke crowns before the weather gets too cold and uninviting. Thanks to good organisation, the allotment keepers of Golders Green escaped the worst of the recent storms, the rain being channelled away. \"Over the last three or four years, we've been renewing the earth drains, so we haven't had any problems,\" says Mr Wingate. For all their individual shyness to a stranger with a notebook, the allotment keepers display an obvious companionship between themselves. Husband and wife team Donato and Carmen Sabatino manage two plots side by side. Donato left the family farm back in Italy to pursue a different career path, but, he says, \"as soon as I saw the allotments I knew I had to have one\". Relative newcomers, Chinese couple the Hys only started work on their allotment in the past year. In between putting up their greenhouse, they have already had a harvest of pak choi and other oriental vegetables. Next door to the Hys, a middle-aged English couple sit in their greenhouse, clad in Wellies and padded jackets, eating a salad lunch out of plastic boxes. They explain how they live on the seventh floor of a council block in Swiss Cottage. \"This allotment is our garden, it's where we escape to.\" They talk excitedly of watching foxes and water rats while they work. Eli Bagdady, an Israeli truck driver, drove past the allotments several years ago, fell in love with the place and immediately secured himself a plot. He's erected a slightly alarming-looking Swiss chalet-style shed at one end of his allotment, complete with lacy curtains, plant pots and even a barbecue. A former worker on a kibbutz, he identifies closely with the communal ethic and is a passionate grower of a huge range of vegetables and fruit. \"It's the taste that makes all the difference,\" he says. In summer, he says, he doesn't need to buy vegetables from the supermarket. While he and many of his allotments colleagues very occasionally use a pesticide when necessity demands it, most of the food is grown using organic methods. \"I challenge you to eat something grown here with something from Tesco's and not tell the difference immediately.\" Looking around at the ramshackle buildings, it's hard not to compare the openness of allotment culture, the way the jerry-built sheds have no locks, with the prim toy-town neatness of the suburban garden shed. Then you get a sense of how oddly repressive the latter can be. Keeping an allotment may not be everybody's cup of tea, but, as Eli states with passion, the allotments are \"a kind of paradise, somewhere you can escape from reality. It's better than going to the doctor.\"",

Dudley was given parole in 1997. The pair have always protested their innocence.</p> <p>Their cases were recommended for review by the criminal cases review commission, which spent three years examining the evidence.</p> <p>The prosecution said Maynard and Dudley killed Mr Moseley either because he was having an affair with another criminal's wife or because he had accused Dudley of being an informer.</p> <p>Mr Cornwall was murdered because he knew the killers' identities and vowed to avenge his friend, the juryheard.</p> <p>From the outset campaigners were concerned about the safety of the convictions. There were no witnesses to the murders, nor forensic evidence.</p> <p>The prosecution relied heavily on the the testimony of an armed robber, Tony Wild, who said he overheard Maynard and Dudley boast about the killings when they were at Brixton prison, south London.</p> <p>But Wild, a born-again christian, admitted that he had lied because he wanted a lighter sentence for a robbery charge.</p> <p>Mr Dudley said: \"He has been in for 25 years now and that is quite enough for an innocent man. This also gives a great boost to our appeal.\" The appeal is expected to be heard in the spring.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A convicted double murderer at the centre of one of Britain's longest running miscarriage of justice cases has been released from jail after the court of appeal granted him bail. Robert Maynard, 61, was sentenced to life in jail 25 years ago for the murders of Billy Moseley and Micky Cornwall, crimes he has always denied. The case became known as the \"torso murders\" when parts of Moseley's body were washed up on the banks of the river Thames. Maynard and his alleged accomplice Reg Dudley were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in 1977 and had an appeal dismissed in 1979. Dudley was given parole in 1997. The pair have always protested their innocence. Their cases were recommended for review by the criminal cases review commission, which spent three years examining the evidence. The prosecution said Maynard and Dudley killed Mr Moseley either because he was having an affair with another criminal's wife or because he had accused Dudley of being an informer. Mr Cornwall was murdered because he knew the killers' identities and vowed to avenge his friend, the juryheard. From the outset campaigners were concerned about the safety of the convictions. There were no witnesses to the murders, nor forensic evidence. The prosecution relied heavily on the the testimony of an armed robber, Tony Wild, who said he overheard Maynard and Dudley boast about the killings when they were at Brixton prison, south London. But Wild, a born-again christian, admitted that he had lied because he wanted a lighter sentence for a robbery charge. Mr Dudley said: \"He has been in for 25 years now and that is quite enough for an innocent man. This also gives a great boost to our appeal.\" The appeal is expected to be heard in the spring.",

At the start of the trial the defence lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Talb, members of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) and other Palestinian terrorists for the bombing.

      "bodyText": "Any restaurant would be delighted to receive a royal seal of approval. But one establishment in Stratford-upon-Avon was stunned when the future King of Thailand ordered an airmail consignment of its speciality, Thai food. Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 49, ordered 350 parcels of the delicate, traditional raw ingredients - not cooked dishes - including pork balls and salads, to be flown almost 6,000 miles to his palace in Bangkok. A \"gobsmacked\" spokesman for the Thai Kingdom restaurant, which imports many of its ingredients daily from Thailand, said the order was placed after the prince dropped in for lunch during a private visit to England last month. Staff from the London embassy travelled to Warwickshire to pick up the raw food and dispatch it on a 12-hour Thai Airways flight. Yesterday the embassy was diplomatic about what could only be described as taking coals to Newcastle. \"It's not very happy for us to comment, because he was making a personal, private visit,\" said a spokesman. Asked if it seemed peculiar to spend so much, he responded: \"I don't know, but perhaps the restaurant was offering a new menu. We haven't tasted the food ourselves.\" A spokeswoman added: \"I don't know if he ordered them to cook to have himself, or to give to his friends and relatives to try. This is certainly the first time that we have had these sort of instructions.\" The Thai Kingdom restaurant was almost as reticent. \"It's a great honour for us, but the embassy has asked us not to talk about it.

These outstanding men and women possessed values and ideals which should be an inspiration to all of us. The accounts of their heroism and desire to further democracy and the brotherhood of man (and woman) brought tears to my eyes and restored my faith in the goodness and kindness of man and woman - in these cases almost invariably the man and woman from the working classes. David Griffith Iver, Bucks \u0095 The interviews with the last British survivors of the International Brigade were fascinating, moving and inspirational. They are the best thing I have ever read in the Guardian and doubly pleasing as I had given up newspapers for a while due to the overwhelmingly depressing nature of most of the news. Daniel Neville London \u0095 As an independent film-maker currently developing a documentary on British volunteers in Spain, I found your G2 special moving and timely. As people gather this weekend at memorials to the two world wars, Guardian readers might like to know that there are poignant memorials to British International Brigade volunteers, erected with the support of councils and trade unions, in many of our cities and towns. They are well worth seeking out. David Leach London dleach@globalnet.co.uk",

Bridget Riley is undergoing a bit of a renaissance at the moment.

Murray Macauley says: \"Pop Art prints have been unfashionable for a long time. The reason we held this sale was that we felt there was a field of art which was under-utilised.\"</p> <p>What the sale probably showed was that there is a renewed interest and demand, but that items are still modestly priced. You would not, for example, buy a David Hockney painting for \u00a32,115, but this is what his print Melrose Avenue, part of his Hollywood series, fetched.</p> <p>But if anyone charts the popularity, decline, then revival of interest it is probably Clive Barker who made a great stir in the 1960s. He had been to art school briefly but got bored and at the age of 19 left and worked for 18 months on the assembly line at the Vauxhall car factory in Luton. Barker remembers being impressed by the sight of enormous skips filled with chrome-plated lamps and the pleasure of seeing new cars lined up on the parking lot.</p> <p>In retrospect Barker recognised that this spell in the factory was one of his most formative influences. Barker was unusual for a pop artist of the time in that he concentrated on sculpture. He turned everyday objects like coke bottles, paint boxes, pieces of old rope and a bucket into glamorous objets d'art by casting them in bronze and coating them in chrome.</p> <p>In 1968 the avant garde art dealer Robert Fraser gave Barker his first one-man show, which gave Barker instant fame and was the beginning of a working relationship which lasted until Fraser's death in 1986.</p> <p>There were many other exhibitions, but gradually he faded from view. The current show is his first for 18 years. There are 27 pieces, all work done since 1998. The prices are reasonable. An item called Mickey Mouse, a Bronze, is priced at \u00a36,000, The Maltese Falcon and a Magnum is priced at \u00a35,500. The cheapest pieces are Agent 007 at \u00a31,400 and Lollipop at \u00a31,250. This is not an auction so the prices are fixed, but I reckon there will be considerable interest.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information telephone Whitford Fine Art, 020 7930 9332, or Caldell Douglas 020 7439 2822.

In retrospect Barker recognised that this spell in the factory was one of his most formative influences. Barker was unusual for a pop artist of the time in that he concentrated on sculpture. He turned everyday objects like coke bottles, paint boxes, pieces of old rope and a bucket into glamorous objets d'art by casting them in bronze and coating them in chrome. In 1968 the avant garde art dealer Robert Fraser gave Barker his first one-man show, which gave Barker instant fame and was the beginning of a working relationship which lasted until Fraser's death in 1986. There were many other exhibitions, but gradually he faded from view. The current show is his first for 18 years. There are 27 pieces, all work done since 1998. The prices are reasonable. An item called Mickey Mouse, a Bronze, is priced at \u00a36,000, The Maltese Falcon and a Magnum is priced at \u00a35,500. The cheapest pieces are Agent 007 at \u00a31,400 and Lollipop at \u00a31,250. This is not an auction so the prices are fixed, but I reckon there will be considerable interest. \u0095 For further information telephone Whitford Fine Art, 020 7930 9332, or Caldell Douglas 020 7439 2822.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The opening scene of Norman Lewis's autobiography features him as a young boy being pushed into the arms of an elderly aunt. She had just had bandages removed from burns on her face and he recalls having to select a smooth surface on her cheek, \"among the puckerings and the ridges\", where he could kiss her. It is a graphic and disturbing scene and, as such, entirely in keeping with his work as a whole. In it he deploys the same unblinking forensic accuracy that he did as a novelist and travel writer depicting scenes of humanitarian outrage in the Amazon jungle, bloody chaos during the second world war or the studied brutalities of the Mafia. </p> <p>With this in mind it can be somewhat incongruous to see Lewis at his home in rural Essex. His village is chocolate-box pretty with a neatly lush green, duck pond and church. His home, the Old Parsonage, is equally picturesque with parts of it dating back to the 15th century. Lewis has said that his talent is an ability to fit in everywhere he goes, but not to really fit in anywhere. </p> <p>He is now aged 92 and although still generally healthy and alert, he is a little deaf and sometimes needs prompting to recall some of his books and his travels. As he sits in an armchair, he could be any other retired gentleman and listening to him talk about himself in his slightly drawly estuary accent he certainly seems as if he belongs in these bucolic surroundings. \"But I don't really know much about England at all,\" he says. \"I've barely been to the north of England at all. I suppose this place is pretty traditional, but I think in various ways I have made it less English.\" </p> <p>Hung under the timbered beams of the entrance hall is the ornate back panel of a Sicilian cart decorated with a picture of the crusades. \"All the carts used to be like this, but if you see one now you should stop the owner and bargain with him until he sells it to you.\" There are sinister-looking puppets from Panama and metal carvings of thin figures in boats from Benin. He has hung vividly coloured South American cloths on the walls. As he explains the narratives displayed on them he seems increasingly less like a typical figure from an English village. The na\u00efve images are strangely powerful, packed with representations of native spirits. </p> <p>\"In this one the man throws vaginas at the tree to get food and the woman throws penises,\" he explains. He not only praises the craft that went into their production, \"you must remember that these people live in the most extreme hardship and danger,\" but also seems to connect with their meanings. </p> <p>Lewis has been writing for over 60 years and has produced 13 novels, 14 travel books, two volumes of autobiography and countless pieces of journalism. Graham Greene wrote, \"I have no hesitation in calling Norman Lewis one of our best writers, not of any particular decade but of our century.\" Cyril Connolly claimed that Lewis, \"could write about the back of a bus and make it interesting.\" VS Pritchett said he, \"really goes in deep, like a sharp polished knife\". But for all this distinguished praise, fellow travel writer and novelist Colin Thubron says Lewis is still underrated. \"In a way he's not been praised enough. He's not written about like some other travel writers are but he is very much esteemed and quite a doyen.\" </p> <p>Lewis's latest book, In Sicily, sees him return to the island. His links there are strong. His father-in-law was Sicilian, and after visiting for the first time during the war Lewis has returned regularly ever since. He probably knows this place, and in particular its violent culture, better than any other outsider. His classic 1964 depiction of the Mafia, The Honoured Society, was published in its entirety in six massive extracts in the New Yorker magazine, and his accounts of the Mafia trials in the 1980s were classics of their kind. In Sicily is partly a memoir, looking back at his long relationship with the island - he is saddened that his friends there seem to be dying on him - but is also alert to the mores of modern-day Sicily. </p> <p>He has always been a master of ferreting out detail. Peter Crookston, his editor at both the Sunday Times and the Observer and a friend for nearly 40 years, explains how he does it. \"There was once a television documentary about Norman which included some shots of him standing by a car that had just been bombed by the Mafia. He looked just like any other, slightly bemused bystander. You'd never know he was a journalist but he is the sharpest guy you could possibly meet and he doesn't miss a thing.\" </p> <p>Lewis says, \"I'm the only person I know who can enter a room, stay there five minutes, and then leave without anyone having noticed I was there. It goes back to my childhood. I learned to keep my head down. There were such appalling things happening.\" </p> <p>Norman Lewis was born in 1908 in Enfield, North London, where his father was a chemist. The family had originated from South Wales and the legend has it that his grandfather introduced tea to the locals, thereby making his fortune, after purchasing a cargo of ruined stock from a ship that had sunk in Swansea docks. The Welsh influence was great and as a child Lewis was sent to the family home town of Carmarthen, to be looked after by three aunts including the burns victim, during a macabre family crisis. His three elder brothers had all died of unknown illnesses - \"a bit mysteriously\", says Lewis - and his panic-stricken parents decided to move young Norman away. \"The aunts were not spectacularly mad, but they were slightly mad,\" he remembers. The title of his autobiography was The Jackdaw Cake [it has been published in paperback as I Came I Saw] because of the weekly cake his aunts baked for the birds. \"They by no means underfed me, but the cake they baked for the jackdaws was a slightly better cake than I ever got,\" he says. </p> <p>His contention that, \"if I am one of the world's great escapists it is due to my childhood\", is hard to argue with, particularly because when he eventually returned to Enfield he found that his father had become a spiritualist medium and his mother a healer. \"My father was a lonely, rather retiring man, but he had congregations of 200 people in our garden shed who came to listen to his nonsense about spiritualism.\" </p> <p>Lewis later came to the conclusion that spiritualism was an inevitable reaction to the mass bereavements of the first world war. \"But to me it always seemed to be the depths of absurdity. Although, having said that, my father could spellbind people of social and intellectual status in the area; schoolmasters from the grammar school fell for it.\" Lewis says he enjoyed school because he was good at it. He won a junior scholarship while at Enfield Grammar and was given \u00a360, \"an incredible amount of money then. It should have paid for my education and books and things, but I bought a motor bike and scraped through everything else.\" </p> <p>During his life he has had several serious motor bike crashes and nearly killed himself in his only car race at Brooklands, in 1939: \"I was flat out, and when I got to the banking on the corner I realised I couldn 't hold it. Everyone who ever went over the banking had been killed. When I was at the top I could look over the edge down this sheer drop to the fields, but in the end I missed the edge by three or four foot.\" </p> <p>Although he won a place at university he didn't take it up, because his parents couldn't afford to keep him. Instead he went into business. A keen photographer, Lewis had spotted that photography would be a boom pastime. His father had already invented a new method of developing prints and Norman had started taking wedding photographs. He launched his business after making a killing on a batch of Leica cameras which he sold to Japan for a huge profit. He ended up with a chain of eight shops in London and the south of England. He also dealt in cars - the classic Bugattis no less - and on a smaller scale once trebled his money on the sale of 360 umbrellas bought from railway lost property. </p> <p>He says now that the first thing he does when he gets the Sunday papers is bin the business supplement. \"I have rather furious reaction to business affairs,\" he says. \"What I do remember enjoying about business was getting away from it. It was all a means to an end.\" But he was extremely astute and successful and made enough money to finance his travels, although he says he can't remember his first trip abroad. \"I assume it was somewhere near by; France was too civilised for me, so it was probably Spain. Thereafter a place could not be too remote.\" </p> <p>His nomadic urges were understood by his first wife, Ernestina. She was from a Sicilian family living in London and was a cosmopolitan figure herself who had lived in most of Europe. Their marriage was unorthodox. They agreed there would be \"no ties or sanctions\", Ernestina would keep her name and they would both be free to part without any claim on the other. \"We were both earnest students of the doctrines of Bertrand Russell,\" explains Lewis. They had one son, Ito, now in his mid 60s, who was, in a strange echo of his father's life, an executive in a large package holiday firm. </p> <p>Lewis's career as a writer started when he was asked by the British secret services to go and photograph Yemen in 1937. He says he was happy to accept their invitation. \"I always wanted to escape and this was another channel. I was with a man called Ladislas Farago, a Hungarian Jew. God knows why they sent him. He had been a spy in the Abyssinian war and wrote a very good book about it. He was a very interesting man although a fantastic liar.\" Farago went on make a reputed \u00a31m when he hoaxed the world's press with the story that Martin Bormann was in South America. More importantly, \"and with disastrous consequences,\" Lewis adds, Farago became an adviser on Vietnam to Richard Nixon. </p> <p>Although denied entry to Yemen, Lewis travelled around the region and published his first book, Sand And Sea In Arabia in 1938. His encounter with Arabic - he is a gifted linguist, speaking French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, German, and Italian - promp-ted him to enrol for a course at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. When war was declared he was in Cuba with Ernestina. He returned to England and agreed to enlist in the intelligence corps because of his Arabic. He spent the first seven and a half months cutting lawns with a table knife in Winchester before he was eventually posted to North Africa with a brief to make links with leaders of local tribes. </p> <p>As a member of Field Security rather than Intelligence - \"they got their boots dirty\" - Lewis was issued with a pass that bore the legend, \"The bearer is entitled to be in any place and wearing any uniform he chooses. All persons subject to military law are required to give any assistance he needs.\" He was later posted to Italy. \"This was his magic card,\" says Peter Crookston \"an open sesame to everything. His job was to tell the generals what was happening in the civilian population and what was happening ahead of the troops, so he just went wherever he liked. It allowed him to get all the material he would later use in writing Naples '44.\" </p> <p>This extraordinary account of life in the ruined city following the Allied invasion of Italy has been described as Goya-esque in its depiction of horror. Lewis says he re-read it recently. \"I thought it was rather good. I had forgotten most of it.\" During the war he was in charge of returning 3,000 Russians - \"mostly eastern tribesmen. I greatly admired their artistic abilities and got on with them very well\" - back to Russia. Afterwards, he was sent to search for war criminals in Austria. </p> <p>He was obviously as temperamentally able to cope with the chaos that surrounded him as he has been with the horrific things he has witnessed since. He jokingly says, \"the war against the Germans was no more terrible than the war waged against some of my mad relations in Wales,\" before adding - more seriously- \"I am ashamed to say it, but I enjoyed every minute of the war. It was endless variety and excitement.\" </p> <p>His readjustment to civilian life after the war was made more difficult by the break-up of his marriage to Ernestina. She had spent the war in Latin America and when he went to Guatemala he was not surprised to find that she was in a long-standing relation ship - with a relation of the president. The marriage was ended shortly afterwards via a quickie divorce in Mexico. Lewis returned to England where he stayed with his in-laws, with whom he always maintained good relations, particularly his father-in-law. </p> <p>Lewis is still unsure whether Ernestina's father was a member of the Mafia or not. \"I suspect he was. He was smuggled out of Sicily to America with a group of people camouflaged as corpses and sent in coffins. His wife got drunk one night and said the day he left Sicily he had been shot at. While he didn't admit to anything he did say he was a member of the Unione Siciliana, which he said was an organisation that looked after the newly arrived Sicilians in America. There were also rumours that he was deported from America, but I got on with him immensely well.\" </p> <p>Lewis then moved to Tenby in South Wales, where he rented a fort which had 16 rooms in four turrets, a banqueting hall, a life-size marble statue of Queen Victoria, and the skin of a 12-foot grizzly bear. In 1947 he moved to Spain to live in the small fishing village of Farol. Nearly 40 years later, when Farol had been transformed from an almost medieval community into just another part of the Costa Brava, he got out his notebooks of his time there and wrote his book Voices Of The Old Sea. </p> <p>Back in England, Lewis married a Scottish army nursing officer, Hester, and had two further children with her. He regularly sees his daughter, Karen, who is a nurse in Cornwall but has lost touch with his son, Gareth, who now lives abroad. He then married his current wife, Lesley, in the late 1950s. They have three children; Kiki, 40, an illustrator, Gawaine, 37, a fund manager, and Samara, 30, a doctor. Lewis has 11 grandchildren. </p> <p>Lesley, who is Australian, met Lewis soon after she moved to London in the early 50s when working as a ground steward for BOAC. She took the job because of the perks of cheap travel and so was immediately sympathetic to Lewis's own globetrotting. She is briskly sociable and open and friends say she has been hugely supportive of Lewis over the years. Although the family never travelled with him when he was working for newspapers she says, \"we did spend all our spare money on travel with the children to places like Sri Lanka. And since the children have grown up I have started going with him to places like India.\" Lewis's 1991 book, A Goddess In The Stones, is a chronicle of his journey through some of poorest areas of the sub continent packed, as ever, with his acute eye for extraordinary detail, such as the tribe where 10-year-old boys are married off to 30-year-old women. </p> <p>Throughout the 50s and 60s he travelled the world and wrote books about Vietnam, Burma, Cuba, Latin America and Indonesia. He praises his wife for taking the domestic strain during his prolonged absences. \"It can't have been that easy for her and I don't suppose it was very good for the children that I was away so much.\" He claims never to have been homesick because what he was doing \"was so gripping, and I was so involved in it that it occupied all my thoughts.\" </p> <p>He had bought the family home in Essex in the early 60s - \"it was empty and exceedingly cheap\" - but soon moved the family to Italy, where he hoped the children would have a less parochial education. They lived just outside Rome and, in one of those macabre Lewis coincidences, an older student at the children's school was Paul Getty III, who was abducted and had his ear cut off by his kidnappers. After the abduction Lewis says, deadpan, \"a few of the richer parents decided at this point it might be prudent to send their children to school elsewhere\". </p> <p>When the family moved back to Essex he began to trawl through the notebooks he had written on his travels. He has invariably followed this pattern of delayed reminiscence and dozens of pocket-sized booklets are piled up in cupboards. They are full of tiny, scrawled, and apparently illegible handwriting with pieces of text pasted in. In one, from his time in Italy, he has stuck sections of Herodotus: \"I went everywhere in the war with Herodotus,\" he says, \"All read in English translation I'm ashamed to say. But it was like having a livelier version of the bible with you - which I've also had a jolly good bash at. I read it as a work of literature.\" There are some wartime notebooks he hasn't looked at yet, having only just considered one set about a journey he made through Spain just as the civil war broke out, which he intends to be his next book. </p> <p> He says he has only recently begun to reflect on his lifetime fascination for excitement and danger. \"And I still can't really explain it. When I recently heard that my friend Donald McCullin was in Nigeria, my first thought was that when he comes back I'd love to persuade him to go somewhere terrible with me.\" McCullin says Lewis was, \"the one writer who always brought out the best in me\". They worked together on several assignments in Latin America. McCullin treasures memories of Lewis, lying in a hammock after a day's work, drinking vodka with a squeeze of lime juice. \"What really impressed me about Norman was how meticulous his approach was. I used to think he had uncanny powers of prediction, but in reality he just knew a lot.\" </p> <p>It was with McCullin that Lewis says he wrote his best story. In 1968 he learned that the people who were supposed to be protecting the Amazonian Indians from the depredations of civilisation were actually in league with the people who were massacring them. \"These were things that just weren't known about then. I felt I had a mission to tell the world what was happening in terms of the fearful destruction of the rain forest and the murder of Indians.\" </p> <p>His 12,000-word article was the longest piece ever published by the Sunday Times and led to changes in the law in Brazil. His subsequent book, The Missionaries, was also widely praised. \"This work always seems to me to have been the most effective episode of my life,\" he says. \"Of course there was a touch of the ulterior motive. It was a jolly good story as well.\" </p> <p> L ewis is in a great tradition of British travel writing but he is unusual among front rank writers in not being upper class and in having contacts wherever he goes. Bill Buford, as editor of Granta literary magazine, is widely credited with launching a golden age of travel writing in the 1980s. He published Lewis and says he has been, \"important in carrying on a tradition of English travel writing that goes back to the 19th century. He makes that tradition stay alive, and the fact that he is not an old Etonian or from Oxbridge revitalises the whole form. He doesn't do it as a representative of an old empire, he does it for adventure.\" </p> <p>James Fenton, whose eye-witness account of the end of the Vietnam war, The Fall Of Saigon, is widely seen as one of the defining pieces of travel writing from this era, introduced Lewis to Buford because he was so impressed with Lewis's book about 1950s Vietnam, A Dragon Apparent. \"Everybody who worked in Vietnam really appreciated reading it. People used to say at the end of the Vietnam war that Graham Greene's novel The Quiet American had foreseen everything that would follow. But Lewis was there before Greene and you wonder whether Greene had read Lewis's book and thought 'this place sounds interesting'.\" </p> <p>Greene and Lewis are often bracketed together. They mined the same locations of South East Asia and Latin America, although they never met. Apparently, once when Lewis was in Hanoi he got off a plane Greene was getting on. \"And when in Cuba, I stayed in the hotel in which he was writing Our Man In Havana, but I never spoke to him,' says Lewis. The little criticism that Lewis attracts is also tied up with Greene. One reviewer noted that, \"whereas Greene's sweltering landscapes can be read as projections of the interior life of his characters, the landscapes of Lewis always remain the landscapes of a travel writer, quintessentially of the surface\". </p> <p>Lewis did meet another literary giant in Cuba, Ernest Hemingway. The publisher Jonathan Cape had asked him to sound out Hemingway, Cape's biggest selling writer, who had not delivered a promised book. \"Hemingway had this coterie of people who followed him,\" recalls Lewis, \"but by this time he was a broken man. He drank far too much and did silly things to draw attention to himself. I saw him get this crayfish and chew it so he crunched up the shell. All this blood would run down his chin. Ridiculous. He had a number of mistresses; film stars and all that, but by this time he was obviously completely impotent.\" The promised book never was written. \"And a couple of weeks later he blew his brains out,\" records Lewis. </p> <p>None of this put Lewis off writing fiction, and for many years he was better known as a novelist than as a travel writer. He had published his first novel, Samara, in 1949 and went on to write 11 more. VS Pritchett, rather precisely, described him as, \"one of our very few capable experts in the novel of the exotic and revolutionary setting\". Lewis's greatest success in this specialised genre came with his 1957 novel The Volcanoes Above Us, based on the Mayan Indians - \"who I was extremely sympathetic to\" - and including a hefty dig at CIA involvement in third-world affairs. It was an international best seller, with the Soviet Union publishing 6m copies, \"of appalling quality\". Lewis received no cash royalty from Moscow but was invited there as a guest of the authorities, given transport to anywhere he wanted to go, and a dacha on the Black Sea. </p> <p>He eventually asked himself what he wanted to say in fiction that he couldn't say in travel writing. \"After that I stopped writing fiction. I think there was some sort of submerged morality that struggled against the falsity of fiction. It wasn't quite life as I saw it and experienced it.\"His writing does exude a sense of trustworthiness. Bill Buford, now an editor at the New Yorker, acknowledges his commitment to accuracy, but also notes that, \"there is also a tiny element of embellishment. Perhaps there is a little area that may not entirely survive the New Yorker fact-checking department, but is perfectly acceptable to everybody else. There is a fundamental veracity in everything he does, that comes from his own experiences, they don't come from third-hand experiences. He is a great observer.\" </p> <p>Colin Thubron agrees that Lewis, \"does like being the most anonymous person in the room. And he has a very cool and sceptical eye. He is no romantic but he is a born traveller, it really is in his bones. I remember someone talking about an obscure state in Africa and his eyes lit up. 'Oh yes,' he said, 'that's a real collector's piece.' He really does relish the strangeness of places.\" </p> <p>\"Norman's great gift is that he is a natural storyteller,\" says Buford. \"What characterised the travel writing of the 80s was that the good stuff was old-fashioned storytelling. Norman collects stories the way other people might collect books, or sea shells, or bottles of wine. You have a sense that he has lived through all these bizarre and extreme experiences and has filed them away with the intention of returning to them to use them properly. If he never did another thing, and lived to be 500, he could keep entertaining us with his stories.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Norman Lewis </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> June 28 1908, Enfield, north London. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Enfield Grammar. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Ernestina (one son, Ito); Hester (one son Gareth, one daughter, Karen); 1958 Lesley (two daughters, Kiki and Samara, one son, Gawaine). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Photography shop owner; Army Intelligence Corps 1939-45. </p> <p><strong> Fiction writing includes: </strong> Samara 1949; A Single Pilgrim 1953; The Day Of The Fox 1955; The Volcanoes Above Us 1957; A Small War Made To Order 1966; The Sicilian Specialist 1974; The German Company 1979; A Suitable Case For Corruption 1984. </p> <p><strong> Travel writing includes: </strong> Sand And Sea In Arabia 1938; A Dragon Apparent 1951; Golden Earth 1952; The Changing Sky 1959; The Honoured Society 1964; Naples '44 1978; Cuban Passage 1982; Voices Of The Old Sea 1984; The Missionaries 1988: An Empire Of The East 1993; In Sicily 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 In Sicily is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The opening scene of Norman Lewis's autobiography features him as a young boy being pushed into the arms of an elderly aunt. She had just had bandages removed from burns on her face and he recalls having to select a smooth surface on her cheek, \"among the puckerings and the ridges\", where he could kiss her. It is a graphic and disturbing scene and, as such, entirely in keeping with his work as a whole. In it he deploys the same unblinking forensic accuracy that he did as a novelist and travel writer depicting scenes of humanitarian outrage in the Amazon jungle, bloody chaos during the second world war or the studied brutalities of the Mafia. With this in mind it can be somewhat incongruous to see Lewis at his home in rural Essex. His village is chocolate-box pretty with a neatly lush green, duck pond and church. His home, the Old Parsonage, is equally picturesque with parts of it dating back to the 15th century. Lewis has said that his talent is an ability to fit in everywhere he goes, but not to really fit in anywhere. He is now aged 92 and although still generally healthy and alert, he is a little deaf and sometimes needs prompting to recall some of his books and his travels. As he sits in an armchair, he could be any other retired gentleman and listening to him talk about himself in his slightly drawly estuary accent he certainly seems as if he belongs in these bucolic surroundings. \"But I don't really know much about England at all,\" he says. \"I've barely been to the north of England at all. I suppose this place is pretty traditional, but I think in various ways I have made it less English.\" Hung under the timbered beams of the entrance hall is the ornate back panel of a Sicilian cart decorated with a picture of the crusades. \"All the carts used to be like this, but if you see one now you should stop the owner and bargain with him until he sells it to you.\" There are sinister-looking puppets from Panama and metal carvings of thin figures in boats from Benin. He has hung vividly coloured South American cloths on the walls. As he explains the narratives displayed on them he seems increasingly less like a typical figure from an English village. The na\u00efve images are strangely powerful, packed with representations of native spirits. \"In this one the man throws vaginas at the tree to get food and the woman throws penises,\" he explains. He not only praises the craft that went into their production, \"you must remember that these people live in the most extreme hardship and danger,\" but also seems to connect with their meanings. Lewis has been writing for over 60 years and has produced 13 novels, 14 travel books, two volumes of autobiography and countless pieces of journalism. Graham Greene wrote, \"I have no hesitation in calling Norman Lewis one of our best writers, not of any particular decade but of our century.\" Cyril Connolly claimed that Lewis, \"could write about the back of a bus and make it interesting.\" VS Pritchett said he, \"really goes in deep, like a sharp polished knife\". But for all this distinguished praise, fellow travel writer and novelist Colin Thubron says Lewis is still underrated. \"In a way he's not been praised enough. He's not written about like some other travel writers are but he is very much esteemed and quite a doyen.\" Lewis's latest book, In Sicily, sees him return to the island. His links there are strong. His father-in-law was Sicilian, and after visiting for the first time during the war Lewis has returned regularly ever since. He probably knows this place, and in particular its violent culture, better than any other outsider. His classic 1964 depiction of the Mafia, The Honoured Society, was published in its entirety in six massive extracts in the New Yorker magazine, and his accounts of the Mafia trials in the 1980s were classics of their kind. In Sicily is partly a memoir, looking back at his long relationship with the island - he is saddened that his friends there seem to be dying on him - but is also alert to the mores of modern-day Sicily. He has always been a master of ferreting out detail. Peter Crookston, his editor at both the Sunday Times and the Observer and a friend for nearly 40 years, explains how he does it. \"There was once a television documentary about Norman which included some shots of him standing by a car that had just been bombed by the Mafia. He looked just like any other, slightly bemused bystander. You'd never know he was a journalist but he is the sharpest guy you could possibly meet and he doesn't miss a thing.\" Lewis says, \"I'm the only person I know who can enter a room, stay there five minutes, and then leave without anyone having noticed I was there. It goes back to my childhood. I learned to keep my head down. There were such appalling things happening.\" Norman Lewis was born in 1908 in Enfield, North London, where his father was a chemist. The family had originated from South Wales and the legend has it that his grandfather introduced tea to the locals, thereby making his fortune, after purchasing a cargo of ruined stock from a ship that had sunk in Swansea docks. The Welsh influence was great and as a child Lewis was sent to the family home town of Carmarthen, to be looked after by three aunts including the burns victim, during a macabre family crisis. His three elder brothers had all died of unknown illnesses - \"a bit mysteriously\", says Lewis - and his panic-stricken parents decided to move young Norman away. \"The aunts were not spectacularly mad, but they were slightly mad,\" he remembers. The title of his autobiography was The Jackdaw Cake [it has been published in paperback as I Came I Saw] because of the weekly cake his aunts baked for the birds. \"They by no means underfed me, but the cake they baked for the jackdaws was a slightly better cake than I ever got,\" he says. His contention that, \"if I am one of the world's great escapists it is due to my childhood\", is hard to argue with, particularly because when he eventually returned to Enfield he found that his father had become a spiritualist medium and his mother a healer. \"My father was a lonely, rather retiring man, but he had congregations of 200 people in our garden shed who came to listen to his nonsense about spiritualism.\" Lewis later came to the conclusion that spiritualism was an inevitable reaction to the mass bereavements of the first world war. \"But to me it always seemed to be the depths of absurdity. Although, having said that, my father could spellbind people of social and intellectual status in the area; schoolmasters from the grammar school fell for it.\" Lewis says he enjoyed school because he was good at it. He won a junior scholarship while at Enfield Grammar and was given \u00a360, \"an incredible amount of money then. It should have paid for my education and books and things, but I bought a motor bike and scraped through everything else.\" During his life he has had several serious motor bike crashes and nearly killed himself in his only car race at Brooklands, in 1939: \"I was flat out, and when I got to the banking on the corner I realised I couldn 't hold it. Everyone who ever went over the banking had been killed. When I was at the top I could look over the edge down this sheer drop to the fields, but in the end I missed the edge by three or four foot.\" Although he won a place at university he didn't take it up, because his parents couldn't afford to keep him. Instead he went into business. A keen photographer, Lewis had spotted that photography would be a boom pastime. His father had already invented a new method of developing prints and Norman had started taking wedding photographs. He launched his business after making a killing on a batch of Leica cameras which he sold to Japan for a huge profit. He ended up with a chain of eight shops in London and the south of England. He also dealt in cars - the classic Bugattis no less - and on a smaller scale once trebled his money on the sale of 360 umbrellas bought from railway lost property. He says now that the first thing he does when he gets the Sunday papers is bin the business supplement. \"I have rather furious reaction to business affairs,\" he says. \"What I do remember enjoying about business was getting away from it. It was all a means to an end.\" But he was extremely astute and successful and made enough money to finance his travels, although he says he can't remember his first trip abroad. \"I assume it was somewhere near by; France was too civilised for me, so it was probably Spain. Thereafter a place could not be too remote.\" His nomadic urges were understood by his first wife, Ernestina. She was from a Sicilian family living in London and was a cosmopolitan figure herself who had lived in most of Europe. Their marriage was unorthodox. They agreed there would be \"no ties or sanctions\", Ernestina would keep her name and they would both be free to part without any claim on the other. \"We were both earnest students of the doctrines of Bertrand Russell,\" explains Lewis. They had one son, Ito, now in his mid 60s, who was, in a strange echo of his father's life, an executive in a large package holiday firm. Lewis's career as a writer started when he was asked by the British secret services to go and photograph Yemen in 1937. He says he was happy to accept their invitation. \"I always wanted to escape and this was another channel. I was with a man called Ladislas Farago, a Hungarian Jew. God knows why they sent him. He had been a spy in the Abyssinian war and wrote a very good book about it. He was a very interesting man although a fantastic liar.\" Farago went on make a reputed \u00a31m when he hoaxed the world's press with the story that Martin Bormann was in South America. More importantly, \"and with disastrous consequences,\" Lewis adds, Farago became an adviser on Vietnam to Richard Nixon. Although denied entry to Yemen, Lewis travelled around the region and published his first book, Sand And Sea In Arabia in 1938. His encounter with Arabic - he is a gifted linguist, speaking French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, German, and Italian - promp-ted him to enrol for a course at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. When war was declared he was in Cuba with Ernestina. He returned to England and agreed to enlist in the intelligence corps because of his Arabic. He spent the first seven and a half months cutting lawns with a table knife in Winchester before he was eventually posted to North Africa with a brief to make links with leaders of local tribes. As a member of Field Security rather than Intelligence - \"they got their boots dirty\" - Lewis was issued with a pass that bore the legend, \"The bearer is entitled to be in any place and wearing any uniform he chooses.

Nearly 40 years later, when Farol had been transformed from an almost medieval community into just another part of the Costa Brava, he got out his notebooks of his time there and wrote his book Voices Of The Old Sea.

And since the children have grown up I have started going with him to places like India.\" Lewis's 1991 book, A Goddess In The Stones, is a chronicle of his journey through some of poorest areas of the sub continent packed, as ever, with his acute eye for extraordinary detail, such as the tribe where 10-year-old boys are married off to 30-year-old women. Throughout the 50s and 60s he travelled the world and wrote books about Vietnam, Burma, Cuba, Latin America and Indonesia. He praises his wife for taking the domestic strain during his prolonged absences. \"It can't have been that easy for her and I don't suppose it was very good for the children that I was away so much.\" He claims never to have been homesick because what he was doing \"was so gripping, and I was so involved in it that it occupied all my thoughts.\" He had bought the family home in Essex in the early 60s - \"it was empty and exceedingly cheap\" - but soon moved the family to Italy, where he hoped the children would have a less parochial education. They lived just outside Rome and, in one of those macabre Lewis coincidences, an older student at the children's school was Paul Getty III, who was abducted and had his ear cut off by his kidnappers. After the abduction Lewis says, deadpan, \"a few of the richer parents decided at this point it might be prudent to send their children to school elsewhere\". When the family moved back to Essex he began to trawl through the notebooks he had written on his travels. He has invariably followed this pattern of delayed reminiscence and dozens of pocket-sized booklets are piled up in cupboards. They are full of tiny, scrawled, and apparently illegible handwriting with pieces of text pasted in. In one, from his time in Italy, he has stuck sections of Herodotus: \"I went everywhere in the war with Herodotus,\" he says, \"All read in English translation I'm ashamed to say. But it was like having a livelier version of the bible with you - which I've also had a jolly good bash at. I read it as a work of literature.\" There are some wartime notebooks he hasn't looked at yet, having only just considered one set about a journey he made through Spain just as the civil war broke out, which he intends to be his next book. He says he has only recently begun to reflect on his lifetime fascination for excitement and danger. \"And I still can't really explain it. When I recently heard that my friend Donald McCullin was in Nigeria, my first thought was that when he comes back I'd love to persuade him to go somewhere terrible with me.\" McCullin says Lewis was, \"the one writer who always brought out the best in me\". They worked together on several assignments in Latin America. McCullin treasures memories of Lewis, lying in a hammock after a day's work, drinking vodka with a squeeze of lime juice. \"What really impressed me about Norman was how meticulous his approach was. I used to think he had uncanny powers of prediction, but in reality he just knew a lot.\" It was with McCullin that Lewis says he wrote his best story. In 1968 he learned that the people who were supposed to be protecting the Amazonian Indians from the depredations of civilisation were actually in league with the people who were massacring them. \"These were things that just weren't known about then. I felt I had a mission to tell the world what was happening in terms of the fearful destruction of the rain forest and the murder of Indians.\" His 12,000-word article was the longest piece ever published by the Sunday Times and led to changes in the law in Brazil. His subsequent book, The Missionaries, was also widely praised. \"This work always seems to me to have been the most effective episode of my life,\" he says. \"Of course there was a touch of the ulterior motive. It was a jolly good story as well.\" L ewis is in a great tradition of British travel writing but he is unusual among front rank writers in not being upper class and in having contacts wherever he goes. Bill Buford, as editor of Granta literary magazine, is widely credited with launching a golden age of travel writing in the 1980s. He published Lewis and says he has been, \"important in carrying on a tradition of English travel writing that goes back to the 19th century. He makes that tradition stay alive, and the fact that he is not an old Etonian or from Oxbridge revitalises the whole form. He doesn't do it as a representative of an old empire, he does it for adventure.\" James Fenton, whose eye-witness account of the end of the Vietnam war, The Fall Of Saigon, is widely seen as one of the defining pieces of travel writing from this era, introduced Lewis to Buford because he was so impressed with Lewis's book about 1950s Vietnam, A Dragon Apparent. \"Everybody who worked in Vietnam really appreciated reading it. People used to say at the end of the Vietnam war that Graham Greene's novel The Quiet American had foreseen everything that would follow. But Lewis was there before Greene and you wonder whether Greene had read Lewis's book and thought 'this place sounds interesting'.\" Greene and Lewis are often bracketed together. They mined the same locations of South East Asia and Latin America, although they never met. Apparently, once when Lewis was in Hanoi he got off a plane Greene was getting on. \"And when in Cuba, I stayed in the hotel in which he was writing Our Man In Havana, but I never spoke to him,' says Lewis. The little criticism that Lewis attracts is also tied up with Greene. One reviewer noted that, \"whereas Greene's sweltering landscapes can be read as projections of the interior life of his characters, the landscapes of Lewis always remain the landscapes of a travel writer, quintessentially of the surface\". Lewis did meet another literary giant in Cuba, Ernest Hemingway. The publisher Jonathan Cape had asked him to sound out Hemingway, Cape's biggest selling writer, who had not delivered a promised book. \"Hemingway had this coterie of people who followed him,\" recalls Lewis, \"but by this time he was a broken man. He drank far too much and did silly things to draw attention to himself. I saw him get this crayfish and chew it so he crunched up the shell. All this blood would run down his chin. Ridiculous. He had a number of mistresses; film stars and all that, but by this time he was obviously completely impotent.\" The promised book never was written. \"And a couple of weeks later he blew his brains out,\" records Lewis. None of this put Lewis off writing fiction, and for many years he was better known as a novelist than as a travel writer. He had published his first novel, Samara, in 1949 and went on to write 11 more. VS Pritchett, rather precisely, described him as, \"one of our very few capable experts in the novel of the exotic and revolutionary setting\". Lewis's greatest success in this specialised genre came with his 1957 novel The Volcanoes Above Us, based on the Mayan Indians - \"who I was extremely sympathetic to\" - and including a hefty dig at CIA involvement in third-world affairs. It was an international best seller, with the Soviet Union publishing 6m copies, \"of appalling quality\". Lewis received no cash royalty from Moscow but was invited there as a guest of the authorities, given transport to anywhere he wanted to go, and a dacha on the Black Sea. He eventually asked himself what he wanted to say in fiction that he couldn't say in travel writing. \"After that I stopped writing fiction. I think there was some sort of submerged morality that struggled against the falsity of fiction. It wasn't quite life as I saw it and experienced it.\"His writing does exude a sense of trustworthiness. Bill Buford, now an editor at the New Yorker, acknowledges his commitment to accuracy, but also notes that, \"there is also a tiny element of embellishment. Perhaps there is a little area that may not entirely survive the New Yorker fact-checking department, but is perfectly acceptable to everybody else. There is a fundamental veracity in everything he does, that comes from his own experiences, they don't come from third-hand experiences. He is a great observer.\" Colin Thubron agrees that Lewis, \"does like being the most anonymous person in the room. And he has a very cool and sceptical eye. He is no romantic but he is a born traveller, it really is in his bones. I remember someone talking about an obscure state in Africa and his eyes lit up. 'Oh yes,' he said, 'that's a real collector's piece.' He really does relish the strangeness of places.\" \"Norman's great gift is that he is a natural storyteller,\" says Buford. \"What characterised the travel writing of the 80s was that the good stuff was old-fashioned storytelling. Norman collects stories the way other people might collect books, or sea shells, or bottles of wine. You have a sense that he has lived through all these bizarre and extreme experiences and has filed them away with the intention of returning to them to use them properly. If he never did another thing, and lived to be 500, he could keep entertaining us with his stories.\" Life at a glance: Norman Lewis Born: June 28 1908, Enfield, north London.

Pigs truffle in mud, British Embassy staff qualify for hazard pay because of typhoid from Potomac river water, Gentle Annie Lyle's place is doin' ace business in the whores' quarter . . . Lincoln moves into the White House (an \"unsuccessful hotel\") and writes: \"If there's a worse place than hell, I'm in it.\" The Civil War begins his first day in office . . . Morris's mini-biog matches Abe for plainness, then catches at the enlargement of the man through presidency until he could hone the 265 words of the Gettysburg address, up to which ain't no successor lived. The Real American Dream Andrew Delbanco Harvard, \u00a312.95 Buy it at BOL God, Nation and Self: through these, writes Delbanco in these essays (so brief, yet so pertinent), the citizens of the US have given their lives meaning to ward off melancholy, that \"logical belief in a hopeless future\". Puritan Calvinism seems benign next to consumerist Calvinism. That's Calvinism as in Calvin Klein, where the free individual - the US's great gift to the world - is \"marooned in a perpetual present, playing alone with its baubles\", and the \"ache for meaning goes unrelieved\". But Delbanco's wit is itself the measure of the land of the free.",

Better smoke yourself than come home with other people's smoke all in your hair and whiskers.\" And so on.

Strange how John Arbuckle could write, in 1719 \"With Snuff the beauteous Celia hides her face,/ And adds a foil to every obvious grace.\" Was Christopher Hitchens thinking of this when he wrote, in his great 1992 essay \"Booze and Fags\", \"smoking is, in men, a tremendous enhancement of bearing and address and, in women, a consistent set-off to beauty\"? Another quotation from this piece is in Walton's work. </p> <p>V G Kiernan, whose book Tobacco: A History Hitchens was reviewing, asked whether, as non-smokers multiplied, the creation of literature would still be possible; and it is true that I have been happy to observe a correlation between tobacco intake and creativity.

She's been pedalling ever since - not quite so fast now that she's 68, but even more furiously as she sees countries from South America to Asia despoiled by development and disfigured by western values. </p> <p>Every trip makes a book and means months of hardship. Just as well she's hardy with a dry humour: her latest is titled One Foot in Laos for the simple reason that an injured leg had her limping through a magic land that only now is opening up after horrendous bombing during and after the Vietnam war. </p> <p>Even as a girl in the Waterford village where she still lives, Murphy wanted to be a writer. But only after trying a couple of novels (\"they weren't even worth typing\") and following the deaths of both her parents (\"they left me a house and an income in 1962 of \u00a34.20 a week\") was she free, in her thirties, go to India, which had fired her imagination. </p> <p>That trip cost just \u00a365 for six months. Hippies hadn't yet blazed a trail, so \"between Istanbul and Kabul, I didn't meet one other westerner, or Australian\". Travel writing wasn't a fashionable genre in the early 1960s; so Murphy followed the solitary stars of two wanderers whose work she admired: the Victorian Isabella Bird, and Freya Stark, who started writing in the 1930s. </p> <p>Murphy is good at dropping the inessentials. Early on, religion (born Catholic; she's now a humanist); ironing (not necessary) and marriage (she's brought up her daughter alone) went out of the window. On the road, too, her kit is minimal. A bike and a beer are her best companions. However she has taken daughter Rachel; most recently to Cameroon, where they acquired a porter named Egbert - who happened to be a donkey. </p> <p>Unlike other big names in travel writing, Murphy has stayed true to the form: she hasn't deviated into fiction; she doesn't intersperse her narratives with chunks of autobiography. She just tells a straight and steadfast tale, from day one through to the last. \"I can't stand travel books that begin with some spectacular drama in the middle of the jungle,\" Murphy explains, \"trying to catch the reader's eye on page one with someone coming into your tent and trying to murder you or rape you.\" </p> <p>Murphy hates the hype that packages other travel celebs; doesn't do author tours or TV; won't take advances: \"I don't want money for a book till it's written and accepted.\" She doesn't have an agent, and has always had with the same publisher, John Murray. Jock Murray [father of the present boss] was her mentor: on his advice, she abandoned two books. One, on Turkey, \"they could have published; it was when I was well established, they would have covered their costs, but it wouldn't have done my reputation any good. I totally trusted Jock\". </p> <p>What drives Miss Dervla to choose a particular country is what she calls \"my inner click\": \"It happens when for some reason I am suddenly determined to visit a country previously unconsidered.\" She was planning to go to to Sri Lanka when a friend mentioned that Laos was about to change for ever. Within an hour, Murphy had a new destination. After that, it was a random adventure: \"I just love unpredictability. It's a great feeling to get up in the morning and not know where you'll be in the evening.\" </p> <p>A typical day's cycling is about 60 miles, \"but at my best I could have done 100 or 110\". Often, she'll wake up in the hut of a village headman; set off before dawn to a town which locals warn is off-limits; carry the bike across a river; use sign-language on meeting tribes people; fall asleep in a forest; slake her thirst at a timely beershop, and accost a bewildered hunter who'll lead her a village to rest and write the diary she'll work into a book back in Waterford. </p> <p>Her early books concentrated on landscape rather than people and problems. Now that she's green and angry at interventionist bodies such as the World Bank, the IMF, the World Trade Organisation and global corporations, serious homework has to be done: \"You don't have to do any research to describe a mountain range; but you have to do a hell of a lot to explain why people there are living in misery.\" </p> <p>In Laos, she was struck by \"the immense skill of the farmers. They have 27 different varieties of rice, and they know exactly which to plant, according to the slope of the land or the rainfall. That's being undermined by us. Monsanto et al coming in with one variety, saying they must do it this way. What is that but the worst sort of imperialism - the disregarding of people because they're illiterate, even though they have this immense knowledge? The cheek of it!\" </p> <p>For the next few months or so, Murphy will be a homebody, rising at five, writing from six. The current project in the electric typewriter is about the Balkans; and it's \"murderously hard going.\", she says. </p> <p>There are prizes and penalties for ageing authors. In Africa, white hair cast her as a respected elder; four months in the Balkans was frustrating because local people wouldn't believe that, with so many young officials from NGOs milling round, an Irish grandmother could have any business being there. Usually with her projects, the journey is the relatively easy; the writing more labourous. This time, both were tough going. Happily, there's a Murphy's law that says, come hell or high water, the book will be finished. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000091917,00.html\">Buy One Foot in Laos at BOL</a></p>",

Jock Murray [father of the present boss] was her mentor: on his advice, she abandoned two books. One, on Turkey, \"they could have published; it was when I was well established, they would have covered their costs, but it wouldn't have done my reputation any good. I totally trusted Jock\". What drives Miss Dervla to choose a particular country is what she calls \"my inner click\": \"It happens when for some reason I am suddenly determined to visit a country previously unconsidered.\" She was planning to go to to Sri Lanka when a friend mentioned that Laos was about to change for ever. Within an hour, Murphy had a new destination. After that, it was a random adventure: \"I just love unpredictability. It's a great feeling to get up in the morning and not know where you'll be in the evening.\" A typical day's cycling is about 60 miles, \"but at my best I could have done 100 or 110\". Often, she'll wake up in the hut of a village headman; set off before dawn to a town which locals warn is off-limits; carry the bike across a river; use sign-language on meeting tribes people; fall asleep in a forest; slake her thirst at a timely beershop, and accost a bewildered hunter who'll lead her a village to rest and write the diary she'll work into a book back in Waterford. Her early books concentrated on landscape rather than people and problems. Now that she's green and angry at interventionist bodies such as the World Bank, the IMF, the World Trade Organisation and global corporations, serious homework has to be done: \"You don't have to do any research to describe a mountain range; but you have to do a hell of a lot to explain why people there are living in misery.\" In Laos, she was struck by \"the immense skill of the farmers. They have 27 different varieties of rice, and they know exactly which to plant, according to the slope of the land or the rainfall. That's being undermined by us. Monsanto et al coming in with one variety, saying they must do it this way. What is that but the worst sort of imperialism - the disregarding of people because they're illiterate, even though they have this immense knowledge? The cheek of it!\" For the next few months or so, Murphy will be a homebody, rising at five, writing from six. The current project in the electric typewriter is about the Balkans; and it's \"murderously hard going.\", she says. There are prizes and penalties for ageing authors. In Africa, white hair cast her as a respected elder; four months in the Balkans was frustrating because local people wouldn't believe that, with so many young officials from NGOs milling round, an Irish grandmother could have any business being there. Usually with her projects, the journey is the relatively easy; the writing more labourous. This time, both were tough going. Happily, there's a Murphy's law that says, come hell or high water, the book will be finished. Buy One Foot in Laos at BOL",

The tragedy involves the aptly named Debby Grimm, whose absence from the evening and from the rest of the Grimm family's lives turns on an ill-fated jaunt on the Pretty Young Thing, a motor boat that ran out of control, pitched its passengers into the water and then \"embarked on its repetitive circular course, leftward, sinisterly\", eventually striking Debby \"decisively\" and crushing \"a plurality of vertebrae\". </p> <p>In several of these 13 stories, tragedy comes leftward and sinisterly, casually selecting its random victims and leaving its survivors maimed by grief and guilt. Throughout Demonology, the persistently and almost pathologically inventive Rick Moody attempts to forge an aesthetics of loss. That the losses he describes are frequently metaphorical as well as actual is both strength and limitation; the stories succeed or fail according to whether their author pulls off the trick of blending the accidents, illnesses and deaths of their plot-lines with the psychological loss that not merely follows but also predates them.

It is his car, of course, and its tyres are bald, because Moody's tragedies are nothing if not comprehensively devastating reproaches to the living. After a stint walking the pavement in a chicken mask persuading diners into the Hot Bird - a job endangered by his urge to lunge at children and tell them of their impending death - Andy finds employment at The Mansion on the Hill, a one-stop wedding factory where guests can arrange every aspect of their nuptials in a series of hermetically sealed, themed suites. </p> <p>Andy's lengthy farewell to his sister is riddled with irony and fury, undercut by farce, and fuelled by muted, bewildered cries of pain. Believing himself to have lost everything, he is a willing spy in the house of love, relishing its commercialism and its idiocies, \"the bondage, the violence, the excess of its cabalistic prayers and rituals\", until he too finds himself undone by the risky imperatives of connection. His assessment of another character, who manages \"to conceal her throbbing, sentimental heart beneath a veneer of contemporary discontent\" is a neat encapsulation of many of Moody's characters, piloted by the twin drives of disdain and distress, and of the author's own position as he steers his battle-weary characters on a course between frantic efforts at recuperation and the siren songs of oceanic misery. </p> <p>The \"contemporary discontent\" that has seen Moody hyperbolically tagged as \"the voice of a lost generation\" surfaces in his embittered sideswipes at America's banalities, on one occasion in the serial business failures of an Ohio loser trying his hand at breeding angora rabbits, yew trees to fight the local cancer cluster and, finally, ostriches, only to fetch up in a trailer park, brought low by the anal leakage caused by \"a non-nutritive fat substitute\". Elsewhere, a minor character loses his false teeth on the golf course, both teeth and ball ending up in a \"humiliating sand trap\". One suspects that Moody takes slightly too much comfort in setting up such sand traps: when the narrator who witnesses this incident remarks that it occurred \"in a manner so vulnerable it provoked a yelp in me\", one feels a shiver of sadism, a whisper of disingenuousness. </p> <p>This tendency to bask in adversity is, at times, a weakness; it leads to the kind of bathos that can undo short fiction.

Even the anti-canonical ones canonise. The slightest anthologised poem has the blush of inclusion on it. Of course, it is not only the anthology's nature, but its task, to canonise. A major anthology such as Paul Keegan's fine new Penguin book, or Christopher Ricks's excellent recent Oxford selection, should first of all include enough of the canonical poets that an unversed reader, limited only to the anthology in question, would not starve amidst frail unknowns, but get a decent, representative sense of the centuries of English verse. The second, less important - if more interesting - task is that the anthology surprise us with the discovery or rediscovery of formerly uncanonical poems and poets. </p> <p>Paul Keegan's selection acquits itself very well on the first front, and brilliantly on the second. It offers a fuller choice of the canonical poems than does Ricks's (it is a much bigger, almost unwieldy book). Readers will have their own fond and foolish complaints and delights. There are three marvellous selections from the 1611 Authorized Version of the Bible, from 2 Samuel (David's lament over the death of Jonathan), from Job (\"Why is light given to a man, whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?\"), and the famous passage from Ecclesiastes (\"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth\"). </p> <p>An inevitable arbitrariness attends the Biblical selections, since there is such richness from which to choose. But a case can be made for the poetic status of the Psalms, and at the very least Psalms 39 and 90 should have been included. Psalm 90, from which Macbeth borrows some of his final soliloquy, resounds throughout English verse: \"For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.\" Isaac Watts's familiar hymn, \"Our God, our help in ages past\", which Keegan includes, is a version. </p> <p>Comparatively little of Shakespeare is here: a decision was clearly made not to excerpt very much from the plays. I would have liked more George Herbert (who is, curiously, missing from the index) and more Vaughan (no one ever includes his extraordinary poem \"Distraction\"), and would have traded more Browning for the extract from Webster's The White Devil. Keegan, like Ricks, omits Hopkins's poem \"Felix Randal,\" so that, peculiarly, neither of our major new anthologies has one of the language's loveliest elegies. Like Ricks, Keegan includes only an excerpt of The Waste Land, which is a mistake, but one perhaps having to do with financial considerations: it is too expensive for anthologies to make fuller selections from contemporary work. Perhaps this is also the reason for the omission, in both books, of \"The Whitsun Weddings\"? </p> <p>Keegan's book is rich with discoveries and reclaimings, however. Like Ricks, he includes Isaac Watts's \"When I survey the wond'rous Cross\"; unlike Ricks, he has chosen Charles Wesley's \"Morning Hymn\": \"Christ, whose glory fills the skies.\" And Keegan has found an extraordinary anonymous inscription, from St Mary Magdalene Church, in Milk Street, from 1609: </p> <p> Grass of levity<br> </p> <p>Span in brevity, <br></p> <p>Flowers' felicity, <br></p> <p>Fire of misery <br></p> <p>Winds' stability, <br></p> <p>Is mortality. <br></p> <p>The book's jewel, for me, is a simple, heartbreaking epitaph by Katherine, Lady Dyer, for her husband, Sir William Dyer, dated 1621. In it, Lady Dyer imagines herself dying and merging with her dead husband. It begins, arrestingly: \"My dearest dust,\" and ends yearningly (I have modernised the spelling): </p> <p> Mine eyes wax heavy and the day grows old <br></p> <p>The dew falls thick, my blood grows cold; <br></p> <p>Draw, draw the closed curtains: and make room; <br></p> <p>My dear, my dearest dust; I come, I come. <br></p> <p>It is a beautiful lyric, a simpler version of Henry King's later \"Exequy\", and one of those poems that once encountered, forever modify one's sensibility. I did not know it; it appears to be one of Keegan's great discoveries: Ricks does not include it, and neither does Alastair Fowler in his New Oxford Book of Seventeenth Century Verse . </p> <p>Keegan's innovation - which, he tells us, is actually an old method - is to arrange the poems not by author, but by year, moving chronologically through the centuries. The anchoring year is the date of publication. Thus, for 1640, we find Henry King's \"Exequy\", along with poems by Thomas Carew and Ben Jonson. Or in 1919, we read Laurence Binyon's war poem \"For the Fallen\" next to Yeats's \"The Wild Swans at Coole\" and Eliot's \"Sweeney Among the Nightingales\". </p> <p>This is not a gimmick, but a bold and inspired mingling. The conventional approach, gathering poems by author, suddenly seems dry; Keegan's book, by contrast, sprinkles each poem with a little of the water of history. Writers are not formally compacted, but chronologically stretched: one will come across, naturally, several different Wordsworths or Yeatses over several decades. Keegan writes in his introduction that the effect is to make his anthology a thematic one, whose theme is chronology itself. He is right, of course, and the reader can see the language changing, and read it almost as if it were a musical score, with its curling dynamics. </p> <p>But he is perhaps too modest. For he also pays great attention to the ways that poems echo and reprise each other, and his mode of selection allows us to do this in enlivening ways. For instance, if one wanted, after coming upon Lady Dyer's \"dearest dust\" (1621), to trace the use of this word as a religious metonym for mortality and the mortal body, one could move forward to 1633, and find Herbert's \"Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,/ Guiltie of dust and sinne\". 1640 provides a variation: Henry King's elegiac phrase \"For Thee (Lov'd Clay)\"; and 1650 brings a poem by James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, with the line \"I'm hopeful, once Thou'lt recollect my Dust\". Charles Cotton, in 1689, has a poem called \"An Epitaph on M.H.\", in which he saucily elegises a seductive woman. He admits that his memory of her, and his poem, is masturbatory, almost necrophiliac in impulse: </p> <p> And now her Memory pursue <br></p> <p>With such a superstitious Lust, <br></p> <p>That I could fumble with her Dust. <br></p> <p>And so on, all the way to 1922, and Eliot's \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" from The Waste Land. </p> <p>Needless to say, such travels are not themselves dusty in spirit, but are adventures on the paths of etymology. Keegan makes us picaros of poetry, and this very exciting, bold new book becomes our happy carriage.</p>",

Before James Boswell's Life of Johnson was published in 1791, there had been \"Lives\" aplenty, but nothing with the exactitude and impertinence that we have come to expect from the searching biographer. \"Lives\" were usually reverential narratives attached to bowdlerised editions of a dead person's correspondence; occasionally, and more entertainingly, they were acts of revenge by enemies or critics. In neither case, even if they contained \"facts\", could they actually be believed. Boswell set biography a new ambition: capturing the copiousness and quiddity of a personality - the self peculiarly revealed in odd quirks and, especially, in unpredictable, evanescent talk. </p> <p> Boswell's Presumptuous Task is an account of this invention of biography. It is not a life of Boswell, nor even the story of his relationship with Johnson, though the outlines of both are rapidly provided. Instead it is a study of Boswell's making of the Life of Johnson, and his efforts to trump rival Lives of his hero. Johnson dies on page 73, with Boswell already in his mid-forties. The meat of the book is concerned with Boswell's seven-year struggle (often against his own indolence or self-doubt) to complete the work that friends and rivals all expected from him. \"Ages may revolve before such a man shall appear again,\" Boswell was to pronounce, but his memorial was not mere homage. He told his readers of Johnson's scars, convulsions and terrible table manners. He let them sense Johnson's touchiness and his black melancholy. \"Everything relative to so great a man is worth observing\". </p> <p>That inclusiveness, which biography-hungry readers now take for granted, angered many of Boswell's contemporaries. His records of \"private conversations\" were thought to be undignified or even morally repugnant. His pursuit of the \"authenticity\" that he vaunted nettled many who appeared in the Life or its prequel, his wonderful Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Johnson. Edmund Burke could not forgive him for publishing Johnson's observation that Burke \"never once made a good joke\" (the hurt made worse by a long footnote in which Boswell tried to compensate by recording some of Burke's weak jests). Several of those who had locked horns with Johnson during his journey with Boswell through the Highlands were aggrieved to find themselves bested again on the printed page. With a background in publishing, Sisman is appropriately appreciative of Boswell's capacity to offend, and the improvement of his work's sales by this. </p> <p>Yet Johnson had himself coined a now familiar word - \"clubable\" (sic) - to describe Boswell (who typically quoted the compliment in the Life ). Boswell's powers of ingratiation were crucial to the creation of his magnum opus, for he had to squeeze from Johnson's acquaintances their recollections and, often enough, their correspondence. Johnson had known that Boswell would undertake this on his death and that he was making a record of their conversations. Indeed, he had encouraged Boswell to keep his journal, as a monitor of his vanities and weaknesses. Meanwhile, he drew the line at some revelations, and was careful to destroy his own diary. </p> <p>\"In making Johnson a hero, Boswell made sense of his own life,\" says Sisman. Boswell was ever a hero-seeker and, as Thomas Carlyle put it, \"a hunter after spiritual Notabilities\". As a teenager, he managed to arrange a meeting with the actor David Garrick, whom he adored \"as a heathen god\". He arrived at the doorstep of Rousseau's Alpine retreat and inveigled his way in. He flattered Voltaire into an \"interview\". When he finally met Johnson in the back of Thomas Davies's Covent Garden bookshop, he was bagging another lion: \"about seven came in the great Mr. Samuel Johnson, whom I have so long wished to see\". He had already met him in his books; he already knew what he was after. </p> <p>He soon became renowned as Johnson's recording shadow, and was not often admired for being so. In his Life, he depicts himself as kindler of Johnson's wit and often its butt. He stirs the great man with provoking enquiries and suffers his rejoinders. However, Fanny Burney noted how he was also an unconscious echoer of his master: \"He had an odd, mock solemnity of tone and manner, that he had acquired imperceptibly from constantly thinking of and imitating Dr Johnson.\" Boswell's replication of Johnson's very accents is just Sisman's theme and, like some other admirers of the Life before him, he is little interested in Johnson's writing. He is curiously incurious about what made Johnson, as he puts it, \"a dominant literary presence\", limply supposing that contemporaries found his word \"reassuring\". Only Johnson's importance to Boswell is important. </p> <p>Yet Sisman's approach has its virtues. His work in publishing shows in a good way, as the drama that he captures best is that of the nitty-gritty making of a book: the evasion of deadlines, the corner-cutting and self-censorship, the final hectic scramble with proofs as the author kept trying to find places for new minutiae. Boswell was helped, but we should more truly say \"superintended\", by Edmond Malone, who had also co-edited the Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. Malone was an editorial genius: even while he was prodding or restraining Boswell, he was working on what was to be the most influential edition ever of Shakespeare's works. Boswell read his first draft aloud to Malone, marking his comments for later emendations. As Sisman makes clear, his \"nice correction\" of the Life involved not only innumerable stylistic changes, but also the rewriting of quotations into \"what Malone - a scholar skilled at recovering authentic texts - believed that Johnson was most likely to have said\". Johnson had to be created as well as remembered. </p> <p>Boswell's Johnson was \"a hero who defied oblivion\". Boswell himself was possessed of a terror of self-extinction. This was revealed most clearly in his terrible fascination with those close to death. He befriended the Keeper of Newgate Prison and procured interviews with condemned criminals. He was an inveterate attender at public executions, closely observing how men and women looked death in the face. And when his friend, the philosopher David Hume, was on his deathbed, Boswell haunted his Edinburgh apartment. Boswell was waiting to see if the notorious sceptic and supposed atheist would finally recant his disbelief (he did not), and was importunate with questions about Hume's feelings in the face of his imminent extinction. </p> <p>In a sense that Sisman does grasp, the whole of Boswell's \"journalising\" was a fending off of oblivion. He quotes Boswell's Shandean thought that \"I should live no more than I can record, as one should not have more corn growing than one can get in\". By making Johnson live he was proving his own vitality. Indeed, without any particular cheating, he managed to give the impression that he was part of the very fabric of Johnson's life, even though Johnson was 53 when they first met and subsequently spent only brief periods, usually each spring, in Boswell's company. </p> <p>By narrowing his gaze to Boswell's \"heroic expression of Boswell himself\", Sisman has produced a sharp-edged portrait. It is not a work of research; everywhere it relies on the unsung Boswell scholars who, over half a century, have made the Yale edition of the Boswell papers one of the great editorial achievements of modern times.

The annual allowance was due to fall to \u00a35,000 in April but the Chancellor has kept it at \u00a37,000 (including up to \u00a33,000 in cash) until April 2006, a move widely welcomed. </p> <p>Also praised was the decision to bring the rules for Peps - which were replaced by Isas last year - into line with those for the new accounts. This will give the millions of people with Peps access to a much wider range of investment opportunities because it ends the geographic restrictions on where Pep money can be invested. As the Revenue says, Pep investors will now be able to invest in the listed shares of companies based anywhere in the world and will also have access to a wider range of investment funds. </p> <p>\"Currently Pep-holders are largely restricted to investing within the European Union, but as of next April they can take advantage of the Isa regulations which allow investment worldwide,\" says the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif). </p> <p>Also, the distinction between general Peps and single company Peps will disappear, which means people with single company Peps who are keen to transfer to a less risky collective investment fund will be able to do so from April, says independent financial adviser Bates Investment Services. Currently they can only move their investment to another single company Pep. </p> <p>As part of its drive to encourage people to start saving earlier, the government said that from April, 16 and 17-year-olds can open a cash Isa. The move extends tax-free investing to 100,000 under-18s who work and pay tax. </p> <p>But buried in the small print was the revelation that in many cases, this tax-free saving opportunity will not apply to pocket money or any other cash given to the teenager by their parents, which is then put into an Isa. The Revenue says that if a parent gives their child money to invest in an Isa, and the investment income arising on all gifts from that parent to their child during the year is more than \u00a3100, this money will be treated as the parents' income for tax purposes and will be taxable. In other words, if you put in money from a Saturday job, that's OK, but if you put in cash given to you by your parents, it's possible you could fall foul of the taxman. It's no wonder some experts, such as Anne Redston at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, are saying it is going to be very hard to police. </p> <p>It was also revealed that around 85,000 people have broken the rules on how many Isas they are allowed to hold, perhaps by unwittingly taking out both a maxi and a mini-Isa in the same tax year.

      "body": "<p>Is your bank manager the right person to sort out your pension, investments and insurance? Slipped into this week's pre-Budget report were proposals that have stunned financial advisers and which are likely to lead to a transformation in the way financial products are sold. </p> <p>The proposals, condemned by consumer groups and financial advisers alike, are being widely tipped as giving the big banks enormous new muscle in the market for pensions and investments. </p> <p>Until this week, the financial advice market was split into two distinct camps; tied agents and independent financial agents. The tied agents only sell the products of one company, while the IFAs are obliged to sweep the entire market to find the best product for you. </p> <p>The big four banks, plus Abbey National and Halifax, are all tied agents. For example, walk into a branch of Lloyds TSB, and the person behind the counter can only sell you a pension from insurer Scottish Widows, which Lloyds TSB bought last year. Barclays is tied to Barclays Life, Halifax to Halifax Life, and so on. </p> <p>But from April next year, under changes announced by the Treasury this week, the banks will be able to become \"multi-tied\". For example, Lloyds TSB could start offering pensions from a panel of insurers, such as Legal &amp; General, Norwich Union or even Virgin and Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p>Treasury economic secretary Melanie Johnson believes savers will be the winners from the new regime. She said: \"Enabling tied agents to offer a wider choice of savings vehicles will pave the way to provide more real choice for consumers and help to encourage the savings habit.\" </p> <p>The banks have also reacted positively to the changes. But others say it is little more than a \"panic move\" by the Treasury to boost sales of stakeholder pensions when they become available in April next year, and which will result in higher charges and, ultimately, worse choice for savers. </p> <p>Leading the opposition is the Consumers' Association, which calls the proposals \"half-baked and misguided.\" Senior money researcher Mick McAteer says: \"We cannot understand the thinking behind this. The government says it will enable banks to offer better products. But if they want to offer genuinely better products, all they have to do is to ditch their tied arrangements and become independent. It is, after all, what they were doing only 15 years ago before they became tied or bought up life insurance companies.\" </p> <p>Many fear a repeat of the scramble to tie up banks in the early 1990s, which resulted in huge commission earnings for the banks, but which some argue contributed significantly to the mis-selling of personal pensions and endowments. John Lappin, editor of Money Marketing, the weekly newspaper for IFAs, says: \"Banks are the big winners from the move to multi-ties, but the history of banks' involvement in financial advice is that they tend to mess up. The banks were among the worst at selling personal pensions to people in occupational schemes and pushing endowments, and several have been fined for mis-selling.\" </p> <p>Until the end of the 1980s banks such as NatWest and Barclays were independent advisers, but found that giving independent advice was less lucrative than either tying up with an insurer or setting up their own insurance company. </p> <p>To win the tie with a bank, the insurance companies dangled big commission deals, which were subsequently passed on in higher charges. The expectation now is that the same process will happen again, as insurers fight each other to get on to the banks' panels. </p> <p>Daniel Godfrey of the Association of Investment Trust Companies says: \"This move is likely to lead to a new round of increased incentives for those who offer distribution and therefore a rise in charges for the very consumers that this move is intended to benefit. It is likely to fail the consumer once again by increasing costs and reducing the availability of truly independent advice.\" </p> <p>But is this special pleading by the groups and associations that depend on IFAs? The treasury believes it can avoid the impact of higher charges by limiting multi-tied products to just stakeholder pensions and CAT-market Individual Savings Accounts. Under the stakeholder and CAT rules, annual charges cannot exceed 1% a year, so even if the insurers tempt the banks with big commissions, they will find it difficult to pass the extra costs on in charges for consumers. </p> <p>However Mr Lappin adds: \"What is remarkable is that for the first time consumer groups and IFAs are in agreement. They both firmly believe that multi-ties are bad news for consumers.\" </p> <p>As the insurance companies fight for a place in the banks' branches, only the giant ones with big pockets will win, predicts Mr Lappin. He says it is therefore almost inevitable that multi-tying will lead to rapid consolidation among insurers, possibly resulting in just three or four giant insurance companies. \"Having a choice of just three or four companies rather than 30 or 40 is not going to help anyone. The Treasury says this multi-tying will lead to more choice, but it is just as likely to lead to less choice,\" he warns. </p> <p> <strong>The speech in full</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers - Leanda de Lisle</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/welfare/\">Related special report: welfare reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">Related special report: New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/\">Related special report: the petrol war</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.peoples-fuel-lobby.co.uk/\">Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\">Key player - the Road Haulage Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\"> Key player - Freight Taxes.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natpencon.org.uk/index.html\">Key player - National pensioners convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\">Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury</a></p>",

Until this week, the financial advice market was split into two distinct camps; tied agents and independent financial agents. The tied agents only sell the products of one company, while the IFAs are obliged to sweep the entire market to find the best product for you. The big four banks, plus Abbey National and Halifax, are all tied agents. For example, walk into a branch of Lloyds TSB, and the person behind the counter can only sell you a pension from insurer Scottish Widows, which Lloyds TSB bought last year. Barclays is tied to Barclays Life, Halifax to Halifax Life, and so on. But from April next year, under changes announced by the Treasury this week, the banks will be able to become \"multi-tied\". For example, Lloyds TSB could start offering pensions from a panel of insurers, such as Legal &amp; General, Norwich Union or even Virgin and Marks &amp; Spencer. Treasury economic secretary Melanie Johnson believes savers will be the winners from the new regime. She said: \"Enabling tied agents to offer a wider choice of savings vehicles will pave the way to provide more real choice for consumers and help to encourage the savings habit.\" The banks have also reacted positively to the changes. But others say it is little more than a \"panic move\" by the Treasury to boost sales of stakeholder pensions when they become available in April next year, and which will result in higher charges and, ultimately, worse choice for savers. Leading the opposition is the Consumers' Association, which calls the proposals \"half-baked and misguided.\" Senior money researcher Mick McAteer says: \"We cannot understand the thinking behind this. The government says it will enable banks to offer better products. But if they want to offer genuinely better products, all they have to do is to ditch their tied arrangements and become independent. It is, after all, what they were doing only 15 years ago before they became tied or bought up life insurance companies.\" Many fear a repeat of the scramble to tie up banks in the early 1990s, which resulted in huge commission earnings for the banks, but which some argue contributed significantly to the mis-selling of personal pensions and endowments. John Lappin, editor of Money Marketing, the weekly newspaper for IFAs, says: \"Banks are the big winners from the move to multi-ties, but the history of banks' involvement in financial advice is that they tend to mess up. The banks were among the worst at selling personal pensions to people in occupational schemes and pushing endowments, and several have been fined for mis-selling.\" Until the end of the 1980s banks such as NatWest and Barclays were independent advisers, but found that giving independent advice was less lucrative than either tying up with an insurer or setting up their own insurance company. To win the tie with a bank, the insurance companies dangled big commission deals, which were subsequently passed on in higher charges. The expectation now is that the same process will happen again, as insurers fight each other to get on to the banks' panels. Daniel Godfrey of the Association of Investment Trust Companies says: \"This move is likely to lead to a new round of increased incentives for those who offer distribution and therefore a rise in charges for the very consumers that this move is intended to benefit. It is likely to fail the consumer once again by increasing costs and reducing the availability of truly independent advice.\" But is this special pleading by the groups and associations that depend on IFAs? The treasury believes it can avoid the impact of higher charges by limiting multi-tied products to just stakeholder pensions and CAT-market Individual Savings Accounts. Under the stakeholder and CAT rules, annual charges cannot exceed 1% a year, so even if the insurers tempt the banks with big commissions, they will find it difficult to pass the extra costs on in charges for consumers. However Mr Lappin adds: \"What is remarkable is that for the first time consumer groups and IFAs are in agreement. They both firmly believe that multi-ties are bad news for consumers.\" As the insurance companies fight for a place in the banks' branches, only the giant ones with big pockets will win, predicts Mr Lappin. He says it is therefore almost inevitable that multi-tying will lead to rapid consolidation among insurers, possibly resulting in just three or four giant insurance companies. \"Having a choice of just three or four companies rather than 30 or 40 is not going to help anyone. The Treasury says this multi-tying will lead to more choice, but it is just as likely to lead to less choice,\" he warns.

Pensioner couples were awarded a rise of \u00a38 taking their basic weekly total to \u00a3115.90. </p> <p>He also said pensioners would benefit from a rise in the winter allowance from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200, payable from next week, rather than the \u00a3150 already slated by the government. </p> <p>The rises were widely welcomed among pensioner groups as the first above-inflation boost in the state pension in 20 years. </p> <p>But the charities Help the Aged and Age Concern claim the Chancellor has devised a complicated system based on means-tested benefits that many low-income pensioners would fail to claim. And the National Pensioners Convention says the rises would \"do nothing to dampen pensioners' anger\" and repeated the call for pensions to be linked to earnings. </p> <p>Last April, the state pension increased by 75p to \u00a367.50. The decision to stick with the inflation-linked rise proved an embarrassment to the government and Mr Brown was accused of being out of touch. Protesters rallied against the government, culminating in a lobby of Number 10 led by former Labour minister Barbara Castle and Cherie Blair's father Tony Booth. </p> <p>Since coming to office in 1997, the government has re fused to link rises in the state pension with rises in earnings. Instead, it has brought in a minimum income guarantee, which replaced income support, that will rise to \u00a3100 a week for single pensioners and to \u00a3154 for couples in 2003. Pensioners must fill in a 40-page form to claim income support up to the level of the guarantee. Claimants must give details of any other income from savings or private pensions, which are offset, pound for pound, against benefits. </p> <p>This week, social security secretary Alistair Darling set out details of a pension credit that will allow pensioners to keep 60p in every pound of their other income up to a limit of \u00a3135. The credit, which will take effect from 2003, is designed to encourage people on low incomes to save without all their savings being offset against benefits. </p> <p>Critics argue that raising pensioner living standards using means-tested benefits has proved excessively complicated and the credit only adds to the confusion. </p> <p>Mervyn Kohler, Help the Aged head of public affairs, says: \"The concept of the Pensions Credit is vital to the government if its strategy of targeting the poorest pensioners through the minimum income guarantee is going to have any credibility. But it is far too complex and over-elaborate. It is clever, but is it right? It inevitably draws more pensioners into means-testing, which many will resent, and so far the take-up rate for the MIG is far from impressive. </p> <p>\"We need a system which is simple, understandable and which accords a proper dignity to pensioners.\" </p> <p>Shadow social security spokesman, David Willetts, says the benefits scheme for pensioners is a passable imitation of the Hampton Court maze. The Conservative party has pledged to fold the winter allowance, free TV licences for the over 75s and benefits that make up the minimum income guarantee, into the state pension. </p> <p>\"Our uprating would give all pensioners under 75 \u00a39.50 a week if they are single and \u00a313 a week if they are married,\" says Mr Willetts. </p> <p>Mr Darling promises that form-filling will be massively simplified and says the scheme will make 5.5m pensioners better off, almost half the retired population. </p> <p>Director General of Age Concern, Gordon Lishman, says the complex use of benefits is already proving hard to sell. \"Up to three-quarters of a million of the poorest older people do not claim the income support they are entitled to, either for a lack of information or fear of stigma. </p> <p>\"Six months into the \u00a315m government campaign to encourage more pensioners to take up income support, only 5% have claimed successfully. With these results, we cannot be confident that the increased income support will reach the pensioners.\" </p> <p><strong>How the new scheme will work</strong></p> <p> \u0095 What is the pension credit? </p> <p>It is designed to allow pensioners to keep their benefits as well as some of their income from savings or private pensions when they retire. It takes effect from April 2003. </p> <p>At the moment, pensioners are entitled to benefits under the government's minimum income guarantee. The guarantee takes a single pensioner from the state pension level of \u00a367.50 to \u00a392.15. But a pensioner who has accumulated savings or a private pension that pays \u00a320 per week will be refused benefits - their extra income will be offset pound for pound against the income support benefit payments. The result will be that someone who failed to save during their working life will receive the same income as someone who put small sums of money aside in a pension or savings. </p> <p>\u0095 How much of my savings can I keep? </p> <p>This week the government said in 2003 the minimum income guarantee will be \u00a3100 for single pensioners and \u00a3154 for couples. The pension credit will allow them to keep 60p in every pound of their benefits up to a ceiling of \u00a3135 and \u00a3200 for couples. </p> <p>This will mean extra cash on top of the basic state pension - sums of between \u00a31 and \u00a323 a week, says the government. For a pensioner with an occupational pension of \u00a320 a week, the credit would leave them \u00a315 a week better off. </p> <p>\u0095 Is there a catch? </p> <p>Form filling will be the order of the day. The government has promised to simplify the forms needed to claim income support and the pension credit. But pensioner groups reckon the forms will still be difficult for many pensioners to work out. The assumption by the Inland Revenue that pensioners can get a ludicrous 20% return on their saving will be scrapped, says Secretary of State for social security Alistair Darling. He also promises that as part of the credit, the government will raise the qualifying capital limits for the first time in 10 years from next April and scrap them from 2003. </p> <p>That means pensioners who are told their savings generate 20% income, whether they draw on it or not, can keep saving until they are older and take the benefits on offer when they retire, delaying the day when they need to use the pension credit. </p> <p><strong>The speech in full</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers - Leanda de Lisle</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/welfare/\">Related special report: welfare reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">Related special report: New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/\">Related special report: the petrol war</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.peoples-fuel-lobby.co.uk/\">Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\">Key player - the Road Haulage Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\"> Key player - Freight Taxes.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natpencon.org.uk/index.html\">Key player - National pensioners convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\">Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Regular as clockwork, income cheques top the list of client demands at most independent financial advisers as falling dividends on equities coupled with lower interest rates on bank and building society accounts bite ever harder. </p> <p>But savers can find yields of over 25% - from legal, onshore regulated investments. </p> <p>These come from the income shares of split level investment trusts. This week Gartmore launched its new offering, the split level Absolute Growth &amp; Income Trust. This holds out the promise of an 8.6% annual return to basic rate taxpayers - 9.5% when held in an Isa - from its \"ordinary income\" shares. </p> <p>The fund itself is a \"barbell\" - some 60% of the fund will go into growth stocks, while the balance will be invested in income producing securities. </p> <p>The managers of this and other similar income orientated investment trusts make no promises - investors can lose their money and the income is not guaranteed. </p> <p>But unlike the corporate bond funds, which promised so much stability to investors and then largely disappointed, these trust shares do not need to hype returns as stock is bought and sold through stockbrokers and savings schemes, rather than through IFAs. </p> <p>In their simplest terms, income shares work by diverting all the yield on a large fund to holders of just part of the capital. </p> <p>A basic trust might start with \u00a310m from income seekers and \u00a310m from those looking for capital growth. The dividends from the entire \u00a320m go to income share holders, while portfolio gains go to capital share holders. </p> <p>There are a number of variants - some trusts are financed by zero dividend shareholders, while others have raised bank loans to boost the fund's size. These investors rank first if the trust's investment performance is disappointing. </p> <p>Split level shares have a limited life - on expiry, income shares are usually paid back a fixed sum, while capital holders divide out what is left over. </p> <p>The highest yield currently available is 29.5% from Archimedes Income, managed by Investec. That is closely followed by 27.7% from Aberforth Split Income, </p> <p>\"If you get very high income, some of this is bound to be a return of your capital,\" says investment trust analyst Simon Moore at stockbrokers Teather &amp; Greenwood. </p> <p>\"But this is balanced off by the higher yield - investors should never forget that there are advantages to getting money back early rather than later. You can get a wide variety of returns and time frames,\" he adds. </p> <p>The details are vital. The Archimedes income share is currently selling around 135p. But when the trust is wound up in September 2003, income shareholders will only receive 25p plus a small \"revenue reserve.\" Anything else goes to capital shareholders. </p> <p>The high income balances a guaranteed loss. </p> <p>Aberforth income shares trade at 54p - close to their low for the year. When that trust terminates in June 2004, investors should receive 10p. </p> <p>Derby income shares - again close to their 12 month low at 85p - yield 27%.

      "bodyText": "Regular as clockwork, income cheques top the list of client demands at most independent financial advisers as falling dividends on equities coupled with lower interest rates on bank and building society accounts bite ever harder. But savers can find yields of over 25% - from legal, onshore regulated investments. These come from the income shares of split level investment trusts. This week Gartmore launched its new offering, the split level Absolute Growth &amp; Income Trust. This holds out the promise of an 8.6% annual return to basic rate taxpayers - 9.5% when held in an Isa - from its \"ordinary income\" shares. The fund itself is a \"barbell\" - some 60% of the fund will go into growth stocks, while the balance will be invested in income producing securities. The managers of this and other similar income orientated investment trusts make no promises - investors can lose their money and the income is not guaranteed. But unlike the corporate bond funds, which promised so much stability to investors and then largely disappointed, these trust shares do not need to hype returns as stock is bought and sold through stockbrokers and savings schemes, rather than through IFAs. In their simplest terms, income shares work by diverting all the yield on a large fund to holders of just part of the capital. A basic trust might start with \u00a310m from income seekers and \u00a310m from those looking for capital growth. The dividends from the entire \u00a320m go to income share holders, while portfolio gains go to capital share holders. There are a number of variants - some trusts are financed by zero dividend shareholders, while others have raised bank loans to boost the fund's size. These investors rank first if the trust's investment performance is disappointing. Split level shares have a limited life - on expiry, income shares are usually paid back a fixed sum, while capital holders divide out what is left over. The highest yield currently available is 29.5% from Archimedes Income, managed by Investec. That is closely followed by 27.7% from Aberforth Split Income, \"If you get very high income, some of this is bound to be a return of your capital,\" says investment trust analyst Simon Moore at stockbrokers Teather &amp; Greenwood. \"But this is balanced off by the higher yield - investors should never forget that there are advantages to getting money back early rather than later. You can get a wide variety of returns and time frames,\" he adds. The details are vital. The Archimedes income share is currently selling around 135p. But when the trust is wound up in September 2003, income shareholders will only receive 25p plus a small \"revenue reserve.\" Anything else goes to capital shareholders. The high income balances a guaranteed loss. Aberforth income shares trade at 54p - close to their low for the year. When that trust terminates in June 2004, investors should receive 10p. Derby income shares - again close to their 12 month low at 85p - yield 27%. When it winds up in December 2003, holders should end up with 25p. Trusts at this level are effectively short term annuities, but with income levels far higher than any on offer from insurance companies. Among less spectacular yields, Framlington Income &amp; Capital which runs until September 2008, yields 10.8%. Currently valued at 51p per share, the winding up should give 30p - investors are swapping a 21p a share loss over the next eight years for a higher than average return. Again, this might be preferable to an annuity - and they can be used in inheritance tax planning. There are obvious risks, but they are clear. But despite these possibilities, income shares of split capital investment trusts fail to appeal to IFAs who stress potential problems, although cynics might argue that the biggest problem for IFAs is they offer no commission. This contrasts with the hidden risks in the highly hyped corporate bond funds. Last month, CGU Monthly Income Plus fund, one of the largest and most widely sold by IFAs, cut its return to investors by a fifth without prior warning. The CGU product had been marketed under the slogan \"A consistent monthly income to keep you going.\" IFAs Bates Investment Services said earlier this year that the fund was \"suitable for retired investors who want a dependable higher incomer to supplement their pension.\" The CGU fund turned out to be neither consistent nor dependable. Now new research from Virgin Direct shows that two thirds of the 41 funds in the UK Corporate Bond sector - mostly sold as safe homes for building society money by advisers - have high volatility. Needless to say, Virgin's own bond fund is one of the least volatile. But others offering a less than roller coaster ride include M &amp; G Corporate Bond, Fleming Select UK bond, Legal &amp; General Fixed Interest, Save &amp; Prosper High Income, BWD Corporate Bond and Threadneedle UK Corporate Bond. At the other end of the risk spectrum are funds from NatWest, Sovereign, Singer &amp; Friedlander, Canada Life, Clerical Medical, Invesco and Scottish Equitable. Over three years, the higher risk funds have underperformed their less volatile rivals.",

Faced with a meagre crowd, Carthy is nevertheless singing and quipping. \"This one is by my favourite singer-songwriter,\" she says, introducing songs by no fewer than three \"favourites\": Paul Weller (a sublime Wildwood), Ben Harper (a gorgeous Walk Away) and, bizarrely, Bad Manners (a barmy Walking in the Sunshine). At this point in her career, it's a testament to blue-haired Carthy that she can throw in such curve balls (there's also a \"Rock\" brooch on her coat, which will alarm folk purists); but they reinforce an impression of a mild identity crisis. She has largely abandoned traditional folk but doesn't seem ready to embrace pop fully. The Bad Manners moment aside, she pointedly omits Perfect, her most obvious potential hit, and seems uncomfortable with the notion of being a commercial artist. \"We're supposed to be doing the new album thing,\" she mock-sighs at one point, turning to her band. \"Um...where's me pedal?\" This endearing amateurism might do her career few favours but it's undeniably funny. Her warmth and humour are infectious, and beneath the breezy melodies lies remarkable candour. She is becoming expert at exploring the carnage of fleeting, passionate relationships. Poor Little Me is ostensibly about an abortion, although she refrains from performing the harrowing, sexually explicit The Company of Men, which may be one lyric about \"blow jobs\" too many for a mainstream audience. Awkward compromises and mixed identities aside, Carthy frequently delivers glimpses of the fabulous crossover artist she can become. The soaring Lazy Angel is the pick of her own songs, although it's hard to dispel the impression of her grinning through Walking in the Sunshine while disgruntled folkie purists grumble through their beards. Eliza Carthy plays the Platform, Morecambe (01524 582815), tonight, then tours.",
