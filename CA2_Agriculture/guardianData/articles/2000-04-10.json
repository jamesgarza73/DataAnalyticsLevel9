Hard on the heals of the Royal Opera's outstanding Rosenkavalier come concert performances of Ariadne auf Naxos conducted by Simon Rattle, which scale similar heights of intensity and abandon. This is no mean feat, for of all Strauss's operas, Ariadne is perhaps the least suited to the concert format. In either of its versions, it's an opera about opera and also - in the 1916 edition which Rattle favours - a reflection on the power of theatrical performance to transcend the backstage tensions which go to create it (the better 1912 original posits a diametrically opposite view). </p> <p>As such, it screams out to be staged, and there's a terrible danger that its impact will be blunted and the cut and thrust of its argument will be lost, when it's done with singers line up in evening dress clutching scores. Nevertheless, this was a superlative achievement, with Rattle visibly relishing every note of the piece and the LSO - apart from a couple of dodgy moments from the brass - playing as if their lives depended on it. There were plenty of sexy, translucent textures, gorgeous string and woodwind solos, and throughout an overwhelming sense of drive and energy. </p> <p>Rattle's Ariadne is Anne Schwanewilms, making her London debut and taking over at short notice from the indisposed Katerina Dalayman (not an easy thing to do). A Barenboim discovery, Schwanewilms is big in Berlin, and, one hopes, will become so here. The sound is rich, opulent, all thrilling top notes and creamy low ones, and the role's colossal range is well within her capabilities. She cultivates a glamourous, statuesque hauteur on the platform - not at all inappropriate here - and suggests from the outset that Ariadne is a woman who has sublimated her sexuality into spiritual yearning. At the end of the opera she yields to Johan Botha's clarion Bacchus with tangible eroticism. She has outstanding potential - and one hopes she won't wreck it by doing too much too soon as some singers are wont to do. </p> <p>As Zerbinetta, Christine Schafer proves a perfect foil. If Schwanewilms is unusually sexy, then Schafer is unusually serious. Anything but the stereotypical tart, she looks svelte and Dietrich-like in a tall coat and is by turns touchingly vulnerable and strongly proto-feminist. Her big aria, advocating equal rights to pleasure for men and women, is beautifully voiced - this is by far and away her best performance since her Lulu at Glyndebourne. Cult mezzo Angelika Kirchschlager is the Composer. The role lies a fraction high for her - you're occasionally aware of effort - but her passionate declamation is riveting. The rest of the casting - which includes Thomas Allen as the Music Master and Christopher Maltman as Harlequin - is luxurious beyond belief. </p> <p>Ariadne auf Naxos is at the Barbican tonight.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"[http://www.arm.com/]\">ARM Holdings</a>, the Cambridge based microchip designer that became one of last year's stock market stars, beat market expectations yesterday to report a 157% jump in first quarter profits. </p> <p>The sparkling figures were still not enough to convince nervous investors to mark up the price of ARM shares, which lost more than 40% of their value during the technology stocks sell-off of the past month. </p> <p>Despite climbing 9% in early trading the shares closed down 57p at \u00a339.58 after company executives told analysts not to raise their earnings estimates for the next two quarters. In early February ARM shares were trading as high as \u00a350, up from around \u00a32 a little over a year before. </p> <p>In the three months to March 31, pre-tax profits jumped 157% to \u00a38.2m, beating analyst forecasts of \u00a35.2m to \u00a37.2m. Revenues leapt 64% to \u00a321.4m, while the total volume of microchips shipped under ARM licenses climbed from 51m to 72m. </p> <p>Robin Saxby, the chief executive, said the jump in profits came from larger than expected royalties from manufacturers who build ARM technology into their electronic devices. Royalties increased threefold year-on-year and now account for 22% of total revenues. Margins climbed from 20% to 33% compared with a year ago. </p> <p>\"We are building momentum,\" Mr Saxby said. \"We have more partners than before who are shipping more products than before and royalties are increasing all the time.\" </p> <p>He added that ARM signed a further five new licensees in the period and extended a number of existing agreements. </p> <p>Charles Elliott, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, summed up market reaction by describing the figures as \"splen did\" but cautioning that the shares, which trade at a heady 300 times 2001's forecast earnings, remain fully valued. \"It would take another very big rise in profits to make the shares look inexpensive,\" he said. </p> <p>Competition concerns, as much as the wider market sell-off of technology stocks, have weighed heavily on ARM's share price in recent weeks. Mr Saxby said he was not worried that the emergence of a number of new microchip design companies such as ARC Cores and Bookham would derail ARM's ambition of getting its technology into all mobile devices worldwide by 2010. </p> <p>\"We will never ignore the competition and will look and learn from what they do - but we have a 10-year headstart on many of our rivals and as long as we implement well I believe history will prove that a lot of their announcements were just noise.\" </p> <p>ARM's growth has been driven by its exposure to the fast growing mobile phone industry; its technology is now in threequarters of all mobile phones worldwide. </p> <p>Other devices such as set-top boxes for digital TV, digital audio appliances, games consoles and hard-disk drives are increasingly adopting ARM technology, Mr Saxby said. He believes cars could be the next big moneyspinner.

      "bodyText": "ARM Holdings, the Cambridge based microchip designer that became one of last year's stock market stars, beat market expectations yesterday to report a 157% jump in first quarter profits. The sparkling figures were still not enough to convince nervous investors to mark up the price of ARM shares, which lost more than 40% of their value during the technology stocks sell-off of the past month. Despite climbing 9% in early trading the shares closed down 57p at \u00a339.58 after company executives told analysts not to raise their earnings estimates for the next two quarters. In early February ARM shares were trading as high as \u00a350, up from around \u00a32 a little over a year before. In the three months to March 31, pre-tax profits jumped 157% to \u00a38.2m, beating analyst forecasts of \u00a35.2m to \u00a37.2m. Revenues leapt 64% to \u00a321.4m, while the total volume of microchips shipped under ARM licenses climbed from 51m to 72m. Robin Saxby, the chief executive, said the jump in profits came from larger than expected royalties from manufacturers who build ARM technology into their electronic devices. Royalties increased threefold year-on-year and now account for 22% of total revenues. Margins climbed from 20% to 33% compared with a year ago. \"We are building momentum,\" Mr Saxby said. \"We have more partners than before who are shipping more products than before and royalties are increasing all the time.\" He added that ARM signed a further five new licensees in the period and extended a number of existing agreements. Charles Elliott, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, summed up market reaction by describing the figures as \"splen did\" but cautioning that the shares, which trade at a heady 300 times 2001's forecast earnings, remain fully valued. \"It would take another very big rise in profits to make the shares look inexpensive,\" he said. Competition concerns, as much as the wider market sell-off of technology stocks, have weighed heavily on ARM's share price in recent weeks. Mr Saxby said he was not worried that the emergence of a number of new microchip design companies such as ARC Cores and Bookham would derail ARM's ambition of getting its technology into all mobile devices worldwide by 2010. \"We will never ignore the competition and will look and learn from what they do - but we have a 10-year headstart on many of our rivals and as long as we implement well I believe history will prove that a lot of their announcements were just noise.\" ARM's growth has been driven by its exposure to the fast growing mobile phone industry; its technology is now in threequarters of all mobile phones worldwide. Other devices such as set-top boxes for digital TV, digital audio appliances, games consoles and hard-disk drives are increasingly adopting ARM technology, Mr Saxby said. He believes cars could be the next big moneyspinner. ARM's technology is already used in airbags, braking systems and engine management and \"the car will become the next big web access point after the PC,\" he predicted. \"You'll be able to watch TV, check your share prices, listen to digital music and book tables at local restaurants using global positioning technology. ARM designs can be used in all those areas.\" ARM intends to open a new office in Taiwan, and has agreed to pay \u00a3375,000 for Infinite Designs, a Sheffield design firm which has previously acted as a consultant.",

The grim truth is that the Marjavels are one of those not so very unusual couples who need a third person in their relationship. Quite who is using whom is very much open to question. This revelation comes rather too late to salvage a play that makes a Brian Rix farce look sophisticated. For a farce to really work the audience has to experience the same fear of discovery that haunts the characters. For them the feeling is nightmarish. For us it is delicious.

It makes sex seem so dreary it might well put you off forever. </p> <p>Things are not helped by a production that approaches the play at a stroll, not a gallop.

Sixfields saw the home side fall behind after two minutes, hit back to lead twice but eventually emerge without a point after Steve Kerrigan grabbed the Shaymen's winner in the dying seconds. \u0095 The League newcomers Cheltenham moved up to third with a 2-1 win at mid-table Lincoln. Jamie Victory and Martin Devaney gained them a comfort cushion before Steve Holmes gave the home fans something to cheer with 14 minutes to go. Town have now gone five games without defeat. \u0095 Second-last Shrewsbury were within five minutes of a win at the play-off contenders Barnet, but Scott McGleish answered Stephen Jagielka's 57th-minute goal and cost the Shrews two points that would have intensified the pressure on Chester.",

He is struggling to find a buyer. \"There just aren't many raving lunatics out there with chequebooks.\"",

Until then Molby had shown the deftest touch himself, volleying the ball back into play in happy recall of his closing days at Anfield when, large as an Eastern potentate, he ruled play from the centre. Mike Marsh's sudden injection of pace made the second for Andrew Brownrigg. </p> <p>In that respect it was a metaphor for Kiddy's season. Marsh, an Anfield team-mate of Molby, has lost once since arriving in November. Ian Clarkson came just before, from Northampton, stolen from under Rushden's nose. But neither can play in the League without forfeiting insurance payouts for injury. </p> <p>Just before the end Engine 7325, plying its puffing business on the Severn Valley Railway, gave a final blast from the past. Stands the club clock at 10 to five and is there money in the hive? Thanks to Molby and a chairman Lionel Newton who made millions from furniture, the face of sport in the county is heading for a new future. </p>",

Until then Molby had shown the deftest touch himself, volleying the ball back into play in happy recall of his closing days at Anfield when, large as an Eastern potentate, he ruled play from the centre. Mike Marsh's sudden injection of pace made the second for Andrew Brownrigg. In that respect it was a metaphor for Kiddy's season. Marsh, an Anfield team-mate of Molby, has lost once since arriving in November. Ian Clarkson came just before, from Northampton, stolen from under Rushden's nose. But neither can play in the League without forfeiting insurance payouts for injury. Just before the end Engine 7325, plying its puffing business on the Severn Valley Railway, gave a final blast from the past. Stands the club clock at 10 to five and is there money in the hive? Thanks to Molby and a chairman Lionel Newton who made millions from furniture, the face of sport in the county is heading for a new future.",

      "body": "<p>Charlton are almost home and dry, with promotion one win away. Yet the nightmares of last season could be about to resurface. </p> <p>It is a measure of the task facing Alan Curbishley's side that, when the Nottingham Forest manager David Platt was asked if he had expected an equaliser, he replied: \"Not against Charlton I didn't.\" </p> <p>Inferiority complexes do not exist in the battle to stay in the Premiership and, if Charlton are to prosper, a considerable psychological overhaul will be needed over the summer. </p> <p>\"I'm going to take a long holiday once the season's over and have a good think,\" said Curbishley when asked if Premiership survival plans were already in place. Sunderland would be an ideal destination. </p> <p>Peter Reid's side have shown what can be achieved with money to invest and a lethal strike force. Curbishley has the former to achieve the latter and, should he reinforce his attack with a Premiership-proven striker, he may be able to secure Charlton's top-flight status. Andy Hunt has thrived in the First Division and scored his 24th goal of the season on Saturday. He managed seven in their Premiership campaign. Curbishley, though, believes that Hunt and his team-mates will benefit from that chastening experience. </p> <p>\"The club is in better shape for the Premiership and so is the squad,\" he said. \"I will have money to spend in the summer but we also have some quality players here already.\" </p> <p>After Hunt latched on to a mix-up in the Forest defence to give Charlton the lead, promotion beckoned. But the home side's equaliser nine minutes from time delayed celebration, possibly until Friday when Huddersfield are due at the Valley. For Forest there is still work to be done to ensure First Division status next year.

      "bodyText": "Charlton are almost home and dry, with promotion one win away. Yet the nightmares of last season could be about to resurface. It is a measure of the task facing Alan Curbishley's side that, when the Nottingham Forest manager David Platt was asked if he had expected an equaliser, he replied: \"Not against Charlton I didn't.\" Inferiority complexes do not exist in the battle to stay in the Premiership and, if Charlton are to prosper, a considerable psychological overhaul will be needed over the summer. \"I'm going to take a long holiday once the season's over and have a good think,\" said Curbishley when asked if Premiership survival plans were already in place. Sunderland would be an ideal destination. Peter Reid's side have shown what can be achieved with money to invest and a lethal strike force. Curbishley has the former to achieve the latter and, should he reinforce his attack with a Premiership-proven striker, he may be able to secure Charlton's top-flight status. Andy Hunt has thrived in the First Division and scored his 24th goal of the season on Saturday. He managed seven in their Premiership campaign. Curbishley, though, believes that Hunt and his team-mates will benefit from that chastening experience. \"The club is in better shape for the Premiership and so is the squad,\" he said. \"I will have money to spend in the summer but we also have some quality players here already.\" After Hunt latched on to a mix-up in the Forest defence to give Charlton the lead, promotion beckoned. But the home side's equaliser nine minutes from time delayed celebration, possibly until Friday when Huddersfield are due at the Valley. For Forest there is still work to be done to ensure First Division status next year. The signs, though, are that a corner is being turned. Earlier in the season Platt would not have fancied his side's chances of recovery from a one-goal deficit with 11 men, let alone 10. On Saturday Colin Calderwood's dismissal spurred Forest on. They deserved to equalise, albeit fortuitously, when Jim Brennan fell over Anthony Barness's challenge in the box. Chris Bart-Williams scored from the spot and only a save by Dean Kiely with his knee from Jack Lester prevented Forest from taking all three points. \"I don't think we are behind in terms of quality,\" said Platt. \"But Charlton are where they are because, while they have been inconsistent in performance, they have been consistent in results.\" It is something the London side will need if they are not to find themselves this time next season again staring the First Division in the face.",

Apart from the 1988 reform that allowed all-day Sunday opening, the licensing laws in England and Wales have changed little since 1915, when they were tightened to stop factory workers turning up drunk and harming the war effort. Mr Straw's proposals also focus on \"rationalising\" the different rules that apply to pubs, clubs, restaurants and other licensed premises. Alongside drinks licences for specified premises, a new system of personal licences allowing holders to sell alcohol from any building will be introduced.

We played it because I'm not prepared for people to feel that the only way to progress through to the final of a competition is to go out and murder innocent people. \"I've been criticised in some quarters for allowing that game to take place. With the benefit of hindsight I would still progress with that game because I never ever want to see violence override true sportsmanship. \"Galatasaray, from my perspective, would be best served by acknowledging there's a game to be played a week on Thursday. They should turn up as a team, with their officials. They will be afforded every respect and given every opportunity to savour the hospitality which is afforded to any visiting club, and whatever the result it should stand. \"But to try and undermine what we wish to have, which is a return leg at Elland Road without any risk to any individual no matter what nationality, I feel saddened by the response.\" Uefa are expected to back Leeds' wishes later this week. Earlier today eighteen Turkish men appeared before prosecutors to face formal charges over the deaths of the two Leeds fans. Prosecutors freed ten suspects, including five juveniles, without any immediate indictment.But police are questioning eight others and are expected to charge four with stabbing and four with involvement in fatal fighting, according to NTV television. Turkish newspapers are reporting that at least five of the suspects have criminal records for knife assaults, theft and selling tickets on the black market.",

      "body": "<p>Jason Fraser is a specialist photographer. Some people might call him a paparazzo. But Jason is a sensitive chap and he doesn't like being designated as a pap. So let's call him what he really is: a sneak photographer. He is, in fact, Britain's foremost celebrity stalker, the man who makes his living - and a very good one it is, too - by taking pictures of people without their knowledge. </p> <p>He haunts the world's beaches, creeping through bushes, hiding behind windbreaks, sometimes hiring boats, so that he can train his long lens on the famous as they soak up the sun, oblivious to the watching snapper. </p> <p>The results of Jason's latest coup were published by the Mirror last Wednesday: three pages showing Camilla Parker Bowles in a swimsuit on a beach in Mauritius headlined: \"Camilla as you have NEVER seen her.\" For this portfolio of grainy, snatched pictures of a 52-year-old woman who thought she was enjoying a private moment on a private holiday, the paper paid Fraser \u00a320,000. Doubtless he will pick up more from foreign syndication, so he is a happy man. </p> <p>The benefit for the paper was an extra sale of about 30,000 copies, a reasonable return on its investment, and evidence that editor Piers Morgan's decision to buy the pictures was justified. Mirror sources indicate that there have been no complaints about the paper's use of the pictures though there were, supposedly, calls from people who thought the paper was \"too kind to Camilla\" in its coverage. So Morgan is happy too. But Camilla, according to St James's Palace, was upset when she was told about the Mirror's scoop. That's hardly surprising. No one likes to think they have been watched and photographed by a stranger, and few enjoy the resulting unposed pictures. </p> <p>The Mirror tried to ease the pain, and deflect any possible criticism, by running deliberately hyperbolic copy: here's Camilla \"showing off a shapely body which could easily belong to a woman half her age\". This disingenuous fluff was calculated to excuse the intrusive nature of the exercise. </p> <p>Hang on, says the Mirror, this wasn't intrusion and certainly no breach of the editors' code of practice. Clause 3 (ii) states: \"The use of long-lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable.\" But this was a public beach. There were plenty of other people around. </p> <p>Even that isn't conclusive because there is an important addition to that clause: \"Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\" </p> <p>If Camilla wished to push it, she could make out a case based on her \"reasonable expectation\". I doubt that she will. Like so many of Fraser's other victims in the past couple of years - stretching back to his infamous shots of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed together on a boat days before they died - she is likely to want to put the embarrassing episode behind her. </p> <p>Gradually, as the months pass, the press is conveniently forgetting the pledges it made after Diana's death. Remember the promises not to use paparazzi shots by the Mirror and the Daily Mail? Remember the hue and cry against the tabloids' use of sneak shots led by Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore? </p> <p>Yet the Mirror, Mail and Telegraph are all routinely using paparazzi pictures again. (A dozen or so were published by the Daily Telegraph during its recent serialisation of the book by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones). Fraser's income therefore seems assured for a long time to come. None of his victims has ever gone to the Press Complaints Commission, and papers are not merely happy to use his pictures: picture desks do all they can to please him. Though both Sun editor David Yelland and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre turned down the Camilla pictures, judging that they might suffer from a negative reaction in \"the court of public opinion\", their picture desk executives were far from pleased. </p> <p>The Sun's team were not only amazed but alarmed. One said: \"You have to admire Morgan's bottle\" and wondered whether, by rejecting the pictures, they would jeopardise their relationship with Fraser. </p> <p>It's not as if the paper is against his sneaky form of picture-taking. On February 29, it showed Gwyneth Paltrow sunbathing. On February 2, it published Fraser's topless pictures of Star Wars actress Natalie Portman. Both the Sun and the Daily Mail ran his holiday shots of Rory Bremner, Tiggy Legge-Bourke and Claudia Schiffer. All of these people may have expected privacy at the time, but neither the papers nor Fraser were troubled by that little matter. Celebrities are considered \"fair game\". </p> <p>Does Camilla come into the same league? Well, there is the argument that she is the mistress of the heir to the throne and the fact that the couple do not yet feel able to take a holiday together with his children (the princes are skiing in Klosters) is interesting enough to be brought to public attention. </p> <p>More pertinently, executives at the Mirror point to a St James's Palace spin-doctoring initiative which, they maintain, is aimed at presenting Camilla in a positive light. They claim that they, along with one or two other papers, often receive calls informing them that if a photographer were to be in a certain place at a certain time, they might be able to take a picture of Camilla attending, say, an opera or a private party linked to a charity. </p> <p>Therefore, it is argued, an orchestrated campaign to win the public to Camilla through manipulating the press entitles papers to take unsanctioned shots of her. In the words of one unrepentant Mirror journalist: \"If you dance with the devil, you will be pricked by his horns.\" </p> <p>If this is true - and a St James's Palace spokesman has described it as a \"monstrous lie\" - then it shows just why intrusion is such a grey area. </p> <p>But does it justify the activities of Jason Fraser? With the greatest of respect to other photographers, he is unlike most of his breed: middle-class, articulate, bilingual, well connected and, according to one of his detractors, rather sophisticated. </p> <p>When he discovered that Camilla was going to Mauritius (under a false name), he booked a first-class seat just behind hers. She, of course, was unaware that the personable 33-year-old on the British Airways flight was Diana's former photographic tormentor and soon to be hers. </p> <p>Fraser will not reveal his source, of course, but vehemently denies that it came from someone in BA, though it is strange how well informed he is about the movements of celebrities around the world. </p> <p> In Mauritius, Camilla was disturbed one afternoon by a helicopter hovering for 10 minutes above her hotel villa. Fraser says: \"I categorically deny that I was in a helicopter.\" But I couldn't help recalling what he told a Daily Telegraph journalist in August 1997, when boasting of his prowess after his Diana-Dodi scoop: \"I do get a buzz out of hanging out of helicopters.\" </p> <p>The Camilla pictures were certainly taken at ground or sea level, and Fraser defends taking them on the grounds that her friendship with Prince Charles has \"pushed her into the limelight\". He also thought the pictures showed her in \"a positive light\". </p> <p>This is one of his favourite responses when attacked about the surreptitious nature of his work. He once wrote: \"It is possible to take candid photographs of famous people in public and remain within the bounds of good taste, humour and decency.\" </p> <p>He has also talked of having a self-imposed moral code. \"I would never do to anybody what I wouldn't want done to myself. By that I mean I don't do people who are in mourning or grieving; I wouldn't dream of photographing someone in hospital; I don't trespass on private property and I don't photograph on to private property.\" </p> <p>Even more high-mindedly, he claims: \"Although I get paid a lot for the work I do, I don't do it for the money: I do it for the precious moments every year when the adrenalin rush is massive.\" </p> <p>He also stresses that his pictures are harmless. \"Look, I'm not murdering people. I'm just taking pictures of people in as flattering a light as possible.\" </p> <p>Maybe he is fooling himself.

How can this value be exploited and extended? If you haven't got it, how can you get it? </p> <p>Today anybody with machine tools and access to cheap labour can make a car. If someone gave me the money I could start tomorrow. This is why the smarter automobile makers are already contemplating a future when they subcontract dirty manufacturing, leaving themselves with the most precious commodities and vital disciplines of the information age: design, marketing and distribution. At the same time, for many individuals the car has ceased to be a viable means of transport: legislation and congestion mock the spirit of democratic mobility that inspired the first makers of automobiles. Equally, technical distinctions are thinning and today there are very few positively bad cars on sale. </p> <p>Competitive advantage used to come from the simple ability to manufacture, now it comes from something infinitely more subtle and mysterious: image. Unlike a production line, which is predictable, the image a car possesses is volatile, transient and difficult to control. Here we are in intellectual territory, surroundings that until now have been alien to the motor industry. Manufacturers may have total control over the design and content of the cars they sell, but they cannot control their afterlife.

Some things are beyond the opinion research, brainstorming, and cost-per-thousand figures that dominate this pseudo-science. It is really more snake oil and sorcery.

Maserati, for example, always attracted the wrong sort of people: men who wear those woven shoes and have a disinclination to do up their shirt buttons. Now Maserati is owned by Ferrari, but these old impressions stick: it's a truism of marketing that image endures long after the reality that brought it about. Even BMW has its problems. In the 80s there were discussions about buying-in used cars to prevent them falling into the wrong hands. Certainly, BMW does a marvellous job of fetishising cupidity, but recent embarrassments with British investments have led to an unfamiliar image crisis. It will be some time before wholesome estate agents stride into wine bars and flash their 3-series key fobs. To add to a basket of positive associations, largely justified by a tradition of refined design and superb engineering, BMW now has to tackle less welcome associations including arrogance, indecisiveness, ruthlessness and a certain reluctance to be straightforward. Still, there are some who say that an air of menace is a significant part of the BMW brand proposition. </p> <p>General Motors invented brand strategy in the 50s when that wizard of kitsch, Harley Earl, defined car design as giving the customer a \"visual receipt\" for his money. But a brilliant strategy that clearly defined Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Buick, Pontiac and Cadillac so that every nuance of US taste was not just catered to, but anticipated, has gone astray. Now General Motors has the unfortunate reputation of owning five brands that even Americans won't buy. The Chevrolet Vega and Chevette were recently described by the New York Times as among the worst cars ever made. It always used to be described as social suicide to be seen driving a Chevy off the Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard ferry. </p> <p>Some of this rubs off on Vauxhall, General Motors' local product. Many people would rather walk than use one. As a brand it represents an almost fathomless black hole. Far better be in a Skoda than a Vauxhall. With roots deep in the European engineering tradition, Skoda never deserved its comedic reputation: the cars were in themselves fine. Their only problem was that the Czech factory was crippled by under investment and as late as the 80s they were still producing a car that was no more technically advanced than the 1936 Volkswagen. And of course corrupt Comecon supply chains meant Skoda had shabby materials and irregular ancillaries. But they were cheap and where brands are concerned cheap doesn't necessarily mean good. Skodas were bought by low income individuals and this set up a resonant chain that said \"I am poor\" and as a result of that robbed downstream Skoda owners of sexual allure and social prestige to a disturbing degree. </p> <p>Then Volkswagen bought Skoda to have a brand for Eastern Europe and things got better. Except the advertising, which was as dismaying as the jokes. As a careless shortcut to credibility, explicit associations made people scratch their heads and wonder why buy a Czech Volkswagen when you could buy a German one? That problem has now been solved by some fine cars, although Skoda does still have its difficulties with names. Felicia sounded like a sexual practice with your teeth misisng.. Now there is Fabia, but it is a car that can be bought without a keen sense of irony. Fallon McElligott's latest television ads attempt to change our view of the brand. The current one has a British dignitary enthusiastically touring the factory in the Czech Republic before asking if they also make \"those funny little Skoda cars\" as well.

And this is why Vauxhall has the allure of a dead cat : there is nothing to believe in. </p> <p>Again, nobody's heart was in Rover: the whole misadventure was like Goldsmith's line about toiling pleasure sickening into pain. This is why BMW will be fine: everybody knows they are fanatical about the product. Jaguar is exemplary too. It just gets better and better.

VW Camper Hijacked by tie-dyed hippies and bronzed Californian surf bums, the 1960s saw the VW Camper transformed from family recreation vehicle to mobile den of iniquity. Ford Escort XR3i Conceived in 1982 at the height of Thatcherism, this beast was soon snapped up by boy racers and equipped with fluffy dice and matching his'n'hers name stickers in the window. As soon as the sun set in Essex, every one way system became an unofficial XR3i racetrack.",

Sadly Rover's image problems are almost certain to hit the range-topping 75 harder than the workaday 25s, so despite their various incentives, it's hard to see the 75 as an ideal private buyer's car. But as the Rover spokesman commented, with what must have been a distinctly wan smile, with a likely maximum of 100,000 75s ever being produced, this model may eventually become a collectors item.</p>",

Maybe you're a student who does not want a career working for corporate America. A graphic artist tired of selling your soul to ad agency clients. A vegan. A biker. A maverick professor. An Earth Firster who liberated a billboard last night.</p> <p>We jammers are a loose global network of artists, activists, environmentalists, Green entrepreneurs, media-literacy teachers, downshifters, reborn Lefties, high-school shit disturbers, campus rabble-rousers, drop-outs, incorrigibles, poets, philosophers, ecofeminists. We cover the spectrum from the cool intellectual middle to the violent lunatic fringe, from Raging Grannies who chant doggerel at protests to urban guerrillas who stage wild street parties. We are ecological economists, TV jammers, ethical investors. We paint our own bike lanes, reclaim streets, \"skull\" Calvin Klein ads, and paste GREASE stickers on tables and trays at McDonald's restaurants. We organize swap meets, rearrange items on supermarket shelves, make our software available free on the Net, and generally apply ourselves to the daily business of getting consumer culture to bite its own tail. We're idealists, anarchists, guerrilla tacticians, hoaxers, pranksters, neo-Luddites, malcontents and punks. We are the ragtig remnants of oppositional culture - what's left of the revolutionary impulse in the jaded \"fin de millenium atmosphere of postmodernity\" in which revolution is said to be no longer possible. What we share is an overwhelming rage against consumer capitalism, and a vague sense that our time has come to act as a collective force.</p> <p>On the simplest level, we are a growing band of people who have given up on the American dream. Here are a few samples of the way we think:</p> <p>\u0095 Instead of treating vegetative, corporate-driven TV culture as something to be gently, ironically mocked, it's time to face the whole ugly spectre of our TV-addicted nation, the savage anomie of a society entranced and entrapped and living a lie. It's time to admit that chronic TV watching is North America's number one mental health problem, and that a society in which citizens spend a quarter of their waking lives (more than four hours a day) in front of their sets is in serious need of shock therapy.</p> <p>\u0095 We recycle our beer cans, newspapers and vodka bottles; we join car pools and food co-ops; we turn our thermostats down at night. We do all the right things. So why do our environmental problems just keep getting worse? Maybe it's time we stopped expending our energies on small do-goody gestures and faced the fact that many of the paradigms within which we live cultural, social, economic - are outdated and dysfunctional. Most of our environmental \"solutions\" are red herrings. They deflect energy from the essential work at hand.

      "bodyText": "Part one: Culture jamming Part two: The Manchurian consumer: are you authentic? Part three: Posthuman: life in cyberspace You may already be a culture jammer. Maybe you're a student who does not want a career working for corporate America. A graphic artist tired of selling your soul to ad agency clients. A vegan. A biker. A maverick professor. An Earth Firster who liberated a billboard last night. We jammers are a loose global network of artists, activists, environmentalists, Green entrepreneurs, media-literacy teachers, downshifters, reborn Lefties, high-school shit disturbers, campus rabble-rousers, drop-outs, incorrigibles, poets, philosophers, ecofeminists. We cover the spectrum from the cool intellectual middle to the violent lunatic fringe, from Raging Grannies who chant doggerel at protests to urban guerrillas who stage wild street parties. We are ecological economists, TV jammers, ethical investors. We paint our own bike lanes, reclaim streets, \"skull\" Calvin Klein ads, and paste GREASE stickers on tables and trays at McDonald's restaurants. We organize swap meets, rearrange items on supermarket shelves, make our software available free on the Net, and generally apply ourselves to the daily business of getting consumer culture to bite its own tail. We're idealists, anarchists, guerrilla tacticians, hoaxers, pranksters, neo-Luddites, malcontents and punks. We are the ragtig remnants of oppositional culture - what's left of the revolutionary impulse in the jaded \"fin de millenium atmosphere of postmodernity\" in which revolution is said to be no longer possible. What we share is an overwhelming rage against consumer capitalism, and a vague sense that our time has come to act as a collective force. On the simplest level, we are a growing band of people who have given up on the American dream. Here are a few samples of the way we think: \u0095 Instead of treating vegetative, corporate-driven TV culture as something to be gently, ironically mocked, it's time to face the whole ugly spectre of our TV-addicted nation, the savage anomie of a society entranced and entrapped and living a lie. It's time to admit that chronic TV watching is North America's number one mental health problem, and that a society in which citizens spend a quarter of their waking lives (more than four hours a day) in front of their sets is in serious need of shock therapy. \u0095 We recycle our beer cans, newspapers and vodka bottles; we join car pools and food co-ops; we turn our thermostats down at night. We do all the right things. So why do our environmental problems just keep getting worse? Maybe it's time we stopped expending our energies on small do-goody gestures and faced the fact that many of the paradigms within which we live cultural, social, economic - are outdated and dysfunctional. Most of our environmental \"solutions\" are red herrings. They deflect energy from the essential work at hand. What we need is not just fewer cars on the roads but new cities designed chiefly with pedestrians, bicycles and public transport in mind. Not just new ecofriendly products, but new consumption patterns and new lifestyles. Not just a carbon tax, but a global across-the-board pricing system that tells the ecological truth. Not just new measures of economic progress more accurate than the GDP, but a radical rethinking of the neoclassical paradigm we've been teaching in Economics 101 for the past few generations. \u0095 Ours is a society filled with exceptional individuals, affluent communities, efficient businesses, top notch universities and exciting cities. But that is no longer enough. The concept of excellence must now be applied to the whole culture. We have never been afraid of getting tough with the other broken systems in our lives; we retrain workers, dump governments, and eagerly, completely revamp entire corporate cultures such as IBM's when they lose their sense of mission. Now let's apply that sane sense of focused urgency to the repair of our culture. Let's rethink our vital components - our information delivery systems, our basic ideas about nutrition, transportation and economics. Let's commit, totally, passionately, to reducing our ecological footprint, to learning how to measure progress accurately, to countering the information viruses spreading in our midst.

Then one of them comes racing into the frame, leaps off the bench, stuffs the ball and exits stage left, triumphant. The second fellow tries to repeat the feat, with less luck. He barrels in, misses his footing and straddles the bench, hard. There is a roar of laughter. People in the studio audience are literally doubled over with mirth. You suddenly realize you're chuckling too.</p> <p>But what, exactly, is so funny? The pratfall was hardly surprising: Groin injuries are the very denominator of this show. It's not Buster Keaton material. In fact, the stunt was so obviously set up, the hapless kid so obviously a dupe sacrificed at the altar of brief nationwide TV exposure that the authentic response should probably have been pity. Or shame.</p> <p>And yet you laughed. You laughed because all the cues told you to. The laugh track and the audience reaction shot double-teamed you. Mostly, you laughed because some network executive in a corner office in Burbank gets paid $500,000 a year to make sure you do. You laughed in the same places that the live studio audience laughed, give or take a little after-the-fact digital modification. The bell rang and you salivated. (Network executives get very nervous about comedies without the signposting of a computer- generated laugh track, which is why such shows are rare. \"I come from a place where getting a laugh from an audience is a rather sacred and holy thing,\" said writer Aaron Sorkin, while trying to sell reluctant ABC brass on a laugh - trackless format for his new show called Sports Night. \"To make one up by pushing a button on a computer bothers me in a place I don't like to be bothered.\")</p> <p>Zap.</p> <p>It's Friday night and you're watching that old classic Risky Business. A preposterously young-looking Tom Cruise is wearing Ray.Ban Wayfarers, just like yours. Is this a coincidence? The movie came out around about the time your sense of cool was embryonic. You don't remember making a conscious choice about eyewear. The fact is, though, that when it came time to buy sunglasses, you chose Ray Ban. And you still wear them and you still think they're sharp. So you begin to wonder about this product placement thing. Just how many other commodity signs are slipping into the Hollywood image stream and influencing your purchasing decisions? The laptop computer you picked up last year. Isn't that the one they used to save the world in Independence Day? The Dr Pepper you just bought on impulse. Didn't Forrest Gump drink that stuff?</p> <p>It used to be jarring to see an actor reach for a Heineken or bring home a tub of Baskin-Robbins ice cream. It meant that reality was intruding on the generic dream world, and it broke the spell. But product placements are everywhere in movies now. (Most people peg the birth of product placement as a full-blown trend to the trail of Reese's Pieces the little alien laid down in ET, in 1982.) Yet because they're everywhere, they're nowhere. You don't really notice them. Just as you probably don't notice brand names in novels or songs. All fictions grounded in the facts of our life are an easier sell. We'll believe a character who drinks Miller before we'll believe a character who drinks \"beer.\"</p> <p>What this means is that we're now ripe for manipulation. We can be buzzed by logos without noticing. This is not so different from being buzzed by a laugh track. We've backgrounded these things and - at least consciously - tuned them out. We've given up mental control. To whom? To the dozens of entertainment marketing agencies in the US specialize in moving products into (and out of) scripts before scripts are ever shot. They act as middlemen between culture and commerce. They spin like lathes behind the scenes so that you don't even to ask why, for instance, there was only one reference to Nike in Maguire - a movie shot through with the Nike ethos of athlete (The answer: because Reebok paid Tristar Pictures a million and a half bucks for merchandising, advertising and promotion of its product.)</p> <p>Some companies pay for placement, others don't. So you don't know if the Coke in the frame just happens to be there or if someone $100,000 to put it there. You don't know how to distinguish between the story narrative and the corporate - cultural narrative. What does it mean when you don't know? What does it do to your cultural stabilizers, your sense of where, and who, you are?</p> <p>Zap.</p> <p>It's August 31, 1997. You catch the breaking news about the death of Princess Diana. Frankly, you couldn't care less about the monarchy, there was something about plucky Di's style that you liked. You follow the saturation TV coverage: the aftermath, the analysis, the condolences, the funeral. Elton John sings a lachrymose tune and you find self weeping in front of your set. It's the middle of the night. The \"people's princess\" is dead.</p> <p>Something very odd is happening. You're crying, but you can't the source of your tears. It occurs to you that you cried less when real people you knew - friends and even family members - died. And yet you're crying now. It's crazy. And you're not alone. The global \"grieving\" for Diana borders on mass hysteria. A lot of people, pressed to articulate why they're so sad, admit they're not sad for Di so much as sad for the idea of being genuinely sad for someone like her - in that teenagers will sometimes admit to being in love with being in love.</p> <p>In death Princess Di has become a legend. More than that, she has become a cultural signifier, like the swoosh or the Golden Arches. She has what French new-wave philosopher Jean Baudrillard called \"commodity sign value.\" Her face became paired in our minds with all the good things: compassion, humility, philanthropy, love. She had become the quintessential heroine of our culture, what we all wanted to be. For fifteen years, she dressed herself for the media and sold herself publicly, flirting with the camera (even as she claimed to despise the photographers), and for fifteen years we consumed her. She created the unforgettable media moments that primed the tears we cried in front of the TV set. When we bought Di, we bought the brand, not the product.</p> <p>Zap.</p> <p>Take stock of your life. Look around at what you drive, wear, eat, smoke, read. Are these things you? Would an anthropologist, given a pile of all your material possessions, be able to assemble an accurate portrait of your personality? Would that portrait reflect a true original or a \"type\"? That laugh you laughed while watching the basketball player get nutted, and those tears you cried for Diana, were they real? Were they authentic?</p> <p>If they weren't, you may find yourself wondering: What else about me isn't authentic? Do I really like diamonds? Do I find my partner attractive? Do I actually prefer single-malt scotch? Why am I scared to travel to Egypt? Are the myriad daily choices I make, apparently freely, truly the product of my own will?</p> <p>Richard Condon's 1959 novel, The Manchurian Candidate - which was turned into a movie Pauline Kael called \"the most sophisticated political satire ever to come out of Hollywood\" - tells the story of an American soldier who is captured during the Korean War, shipped to Manchuria and groomed, via brainwashing, to become a robotic assassin programmed to kill the US president upon a predetermined verbal command.</p> <p>The subtext of the movie is that Americans are being depatterned by propaganda systems they may not understand or even be aware of. The modern consumer is indeed a Manchurian Candidate living in trance. He has a vague notion that at some point early in his life, experiments were carried out on him, but he can't remember much about them. While he was drugged, or too young to remember, ideas were implanted into his subconscious with a view to changing his behavior. The Manchurian Consumer has been programmed not to kill the president, but to go out and purchase things on one of a number of predetermined commands.</p> <p>Slogans now come easily to his lips. He has warm feelings toward many products. Even his most innate drives and emotions trigger immediate connections with consumer goods. Hunger equals Big Mac. Drowsiness equals Starbucks. Depression equals Prozac.</p> <p>And what about that burning anxiety, that deep, almost forgotten feeling of alarm at his lost independence and sense of self? To the Manchurian Consumer, that's the signal to turn on the TV.</p> <p><strong>Excerpted from Culture Jam by Kalle Lasn, Copyright \u00a9 1999 by Kalle Lasn.

His whole existence has become a surfin' safari. Nothing is more or less important than anything else. He's supernatural now. He picks up a book, skims a sentence. Looks at a bit of this and a bit of that.</p> <p>He absorbs everything, but not deeply. Everything is nonlinear. Nothing can be sustained - not his interest in his job or his colleagues, not even his marriage: If it's not going well, his first instinct is to surf away.</p> <p>In related news, a colleague recently watched his upstairs neighbour undergo a slow personality shift. It began when she discovered a particular chat group on the Internet. Her mild curiosity about this new world grew into a full-fledged addiction. Day and night she jumped in and out of conversations with strangers on one topic or another. These strangers, who may or may not use their real names or genders, who may or may not tell the truth, came to seem almost like friends. She knew some of them as if they were family.</p> <p>She lost ten pounds after discovering this chat group - because she forgot to eat. \"Sometimes I go out,\" she'd say, but she didn't mean \"out\" out, she meant \"out\" of that chat group and into another site somewhere else on the Net. She was reluctant to sleep because she might miss an interesting thread. One time my friend saw her on the street, and she hadn't showered in four days.</p> <p>Now she's a very smart woman, but her addiction - she calls it that herself - changed her. She grew so accustomed to typing her thoughts that her verbal skills suffered. She spoke too quickly, running her words together so that it all sounded like one long word. Her eyes were fixed and liquid and her teeth were a strange color. She behaved erratically. She vacuumed at all hours. At one point she considered getting another e-mail address under another name, so she could \"flame\" herself.</p> <p>A psychologist might diagnose this woman as being in the early stages of some dissociative disorder. But she's still fairly grounded compared to others who have more fully immersed themselves in cyberculture.</p> <p>All across the Net, people (mostly young men) haunt cyberhangouts called MUDs (Multiple-User Domains), where role-playing fantasy games are always in progress. These places are as complex and esoteric as the imaginations of the players allow. They are \"transformative,\" in that they let the user determine the outcome.</p> <p>In her book Life on the Screen, American psychoanalyst Sherry Turkle describes one young man, an inveterate webcrawler, who's a character in six MUDs at the same time. In each MUD he is a different person: a teenage girl, a history professor, a dog, an Arthurian knight, a cyborg and William S. Burroughs. In none of them is he actually himself. Yet each persona has come to feel as real to him as his \"real\" self. When not directly participating in one group, he sometimes puts that self to \"sleep.\" The character is still in the game, can interact with other players on a superficial level via artificial intelligence programmes, and can summon the real guy back to assume his MUD alter ego via a \"page\" if something exciting is about to happen.</p> <p>Reading this story about mediated self-constructions reminded me of an article Ann Beattie wrote for Esquire about ten years ago. She had tagged along with a bunch of Japanese tourists on a bus ride through San Francisco. What struck her was the way the passengers, confronted with scenes of beauty or recognizable iconography (like the Golden Gate Bridge), reflexively put their cameras to their eyes. Only when these things were thus \"framed\" did they become valid. Only when they were memorialized on film did they live. This, I think, is the hazardous fallout from an overmediated world, where nothing that happens becomes real until you can make it fit into the spectacle, or make the spectacle fit into it. \"I knew a Californian who read his poetry aloud at parties until his friends learned to silence him,\" writes anthropologist Edmund Carpenter in his book Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me! But when he played recordings of these same poems, everybody listened.\" The Situationists might say such tales, as they accumulate, mark the end of authentic experience, and therefore the end of the authentic self.</p> <p>Perhaps there's no such thing as an authentic self.

      "bodyText": "Part one: Culture jamming Part two: The Manchurian consumer: are you authentic? Part four: The new activism (fire in the belly) I know a young man who has spent the last few years surfing the electronic media. His whole existence has become a surfin' safari. Nothing is more or less important than anything else. He's supernatural now. He picks up a book, skims a sentence. Looks at a bit of this and a bit of that. He absorbs everything, but not deeply. Everything is nonlinear. Nothing can be sustained - not his interest in his job or his colleagues, not even his marriage: If it's not going well, his first instinct is to surf away. In related news, a colleague recently watched his upstairs neighbour undergo a slow personality shift. It began when she discovered a particular chat group on the Internet. Her mild curiosity about this new world grew into a full-fledged addiction. Day and night she jumped in and out of conversations with strangers on one topic or another. These strangers, who may or may not use their real names or genders, who may or may not tell the truth, came to seem almost like friends. She knew some of them as if they were family.

That message is, We can change the world. It's risky these days to make such a promise because it sounds like one of those meaningless \"awaken the inner giant\" - type bromides: If you can dream it, you can do it,\" \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\" and so on.</p> <p>But it's true. We're serious. We call ourselves culture jammers. We're a loose global network of media activists who see ourselves as the advance shock troops of the most significant social movement of the next twenty years. Our aim is to topple existing power structures and forge major adjustments to the way we will live in the twenty-first century. We believe culture jamming will become to our era what civil rights was to the 60s, what feminism was to the 70s, what environmental activism was to the 80s. It will alter the way we live and think. It will change the way information flows, the way institutions wield power, the way TV stations are run, the way the food, fashion, automobile, sports, music and culture industries set their agendas. Above all, it will change the way we interact with the mass media and the way in which meaning is produced in our society.</p> <p>We are a very diverse tribe. Our people range from born-again Lefties to Green entrepreneurs to fundamentalist Christians who don't like what television is doing to their kids; from punk anarchists to communications professors to advertising executives searching for a new role in life. Many of us are longtime activists who in the midst of our best efforts suddenly felt spiritually winded. For us feminism had run out of steam, the environmental movement no longer excited, the fire no longer burned in the belly of the Left, and youth rebellion was looking more and more like an empty gesture inspired by Nike. We were losing.</p> <p>Then we had an idea. Maybe if we banged together the heads of all these activists and reconfigured the fragmented forces of identity politics into a new, empowered movement, we could start winning again.</p> <p>We weren't looking for it necessarily, but each one of us in our own way has had a political awakening; a series of very personal \"moments of truth\" about ourselves and how the world works. For some, these insights have come on like powerful, secular epiphanies. Sometimes they have been triggered by things we overheard or read or stumbled upon. Sometimes they have involved things we thought we knew but now, suddenly, felt. These truths have left us shaken; it's no exaggeration to say they have changed our lives. I'd like to share with you some of the insights that have occurred to me over the last decade or so.</p> <p><strong>America is no longer a country. It's a multitrillion-dollar brand.</strong> America TM is essentially no different from McDonald's, Marlboro or General Motors. It's an image \"sold\" not only to the citizens of the U.S.A., but to consumers worldwide. The American brand is associated with catchwords such as \"democracy,\" \"opportunity\" and \"freedom.\" But like cigarettes that are sold as symbols of vitality and youthful rebellion, the American reality is very different from its brand image. America Tm has been subverted by corporate agendas. Its elected officials bow before corporate power as a condition of their survival in office. A collective sense of powerlessness and disillusionment has set in. A deeply felt sense of betrayal is brewing.</p> <p><strong>American culture is no longer created by the people.</strong> Our stories, once passed from one generation to the next by parents, neighbors and teachers, are now told by distant corporations with \"something to sell as well as to tell.\" Brands, products, fashions, celebrities, entertainments the spectacles that surround the production of culture-are our culture now. Our role is mostly to listen and watch - and then, based on what we have heard and seen, to buy.</p> <p><strong>A free, authentic life is no longer possible in America TM today. </strong>We are being manipulated in the most insidious way. Our emotions, personalities and core values are under siege from media and cultural forces too complex to decode. A continuous product message has woven itself into the very fabric of our existence. Most North Americans now live designer lives - sleep, eat, sit in car, work, shop, watch TV, sleep again. I doubt there's more than a handful of free, spontaneous minutes anywhere in that cycle. </p> <p><strong>We ourselves have been branded.</strong> The human spirit of prideful contrariness and fierce independence has been oddly tamed. We have evolved into a smile-button culture. We wear the trendiest fashions, drive the best cars industry can produce and project an image of incredible affluence-cool people living life to the hilt. But behind that happy mask is a face so ugly it invariably shocks the hell out of my friends from developing countries who come to visit, expecting the giddy Americana depicted on TV and finding instead a horror show of disconnection and anomie.</p> <p><strong>Our mass media dispense a kind of Huxleyan \"Soma.\"</strong> The most powerful narcotic in the world is the promise of belonging. And belonging is best achieved by conforming to the prescriptions of America TM . In this way a perverted sense of cool takes hold of the imaginations of our children. And thus a heavily manipulative corporate ethos drives our Culture. Cool is indispensable - and readily, endlessly dispensed. You can get it on every corner (for the right price), though it's highly addictive and its effects are short-lived. If you're here for cool today, you'll almost certainly be back for more tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>American cool is a global pandemic.</strong> Communities, traditions, cultural heritages, sovereignties, whole histories are being replaced by a barren American monoculture. Living in Japan during its period of sharpest transition to a western way of life, I was astonished by the speed and force with which the American brand took hold. I saw a culture with thousands of years of tradition behind it vanquished in two generations. Suddenly, high school girls were selling themselves after class for $150 a trick so they'd have cash to buy American jeans and handbags.</p> <p> <strong>The Earth can no longer support the lifestyle of the coolhunting American-style consumer. </strong>We have sought, bought, spewed and devoured too much, too fast, too brazenly, and now we're about to pay. Economic \"progress\" is killing the planet.</p> <p>This did not fully hit home for me until 1989, when a spate of nightmarish environmental stories suddenly appeared on the news: acid rain, dying seals in the North Sea, medical waste washing up on New York beaches, garbage barges turned away from port after port, a growing hole in the ozone layer, and the discovery that the milk in American mothers' breasts had four times the amount of DDT permitted in cow's milk. In that year a critical mass of people saw the light and became \"environmentalists.\" We were witnessing the spectre of a whole planet heading for ruin. To people like me for whom time had always seemed like a constant, eternally moving train which people got on and, seventy years later, got off, it was the end of innocence. The premonition of ecocide -planetary death- became real for the first time, and it terrified me. It still does.</p> <p>Once you experience even a few of these \"moments of truth,\" things can never be the same again. Your life veers off in strange new directions. It's very exciting and a little scary. Ideas blossom into obsessions. The imperative to live life differently keeps building until the day it breaks through the surface.</p> <p>When it happened to me I was in my neighbourhood supermarket parking lot. I was plugging a coin into a shopping cart when it suddenly occurred to me just what a dope I was. Here I was putting in my quarter for the privilege of spending money in a store I come to every week but hate, a sterile chain store that rarely carries any locally grown produce and always makes me stand in line to pay. And when I was finished shopping I'd have to take this cart back to the exact place their efficiency experts have decreed, and slide it back in with all the other carts, rehook it and push the red button to get my damn quarter back.</p> <p>A little internal fuse blew. I stopped moving. I glanced around to make sure no one was watching. Then I reached for that big bent coin I'd been carrying in my pocket and I rammed it as hard as I could into the coin slot. And then with the lucky Buddha charm on my keyring I banged that coin in tight until it jammed. I didn't stop to analyze whether this was ethical or not - I just let my anger flow. And then I walked away from that supermarket and headed for the little fruit and vegetable store down the road. I felt more alive than I had in months.</p> <p>Much later I realized I had stumbled on one of the great secrets of modern urban existence: Honor your instincts. Let your anger out. When it wells up suddenly from deep in your gut, don't suppress it channel it, trust it, use it. Don't be so unthinkingly civil all the time. When the system is grinding you down, unplug the grinding wheel.</p> <p>Once you start thinking and acting this way, once you realize that consumer capitalism is by its very nature unethical, and therefore it's not unethical to jam it; once you understand that civil disobedience has a long and honorable history that goes back to Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Henry David Thoreau; once you start trusting yourself and relating to the world as an empowered human being instead of a hapless consumer drone, something remarkable happens. Your cynicism dissolves.</p> <p>If cool is the Huxleyan \"soma\" of our time, then cynicism is its poisonous, paralytic side effect. It is the dark side of cool. It's part of the reason we watch too much TV and don't bother to vote. It's why we get stuck year after year in tedious, meaningless jobs. It's why we're bored so much of the time and become compulsive shoppers. To find a way out of cynicism is to find a way out of the postmodern malaise. On the far side of cynicism lies freedom. And the pursuit of freedom is what revolutions - and this book-are all about.</p> <p>The Situationists saw this revolution coming long ago. The French philosophical movement that inspired the 1968 Paris riots predicted what might happen to a society driven by consumer capitalism. The Situationists intuited how hard it would be to hang on to one's core self in a \"society of spectacle,\" a world of manufactured desires and manipulated emotions. Guy Debord, the leader of the Situationist movement, said: \"Revolution is not showing life to people, but making them live.\" This instinct to be free and unfettered is hard-wired into each one of us. It's a drive as strong as sex or hunger, an irresistible force that, once harnessed, is almost impossible to stop.</p> <p>With that irresistible force on our side, we will strike.</p> <p>We will strike by smashing the postmodern hall of mirrors and redefining what it means to be alive. We will reframe the battle in the grandest terms. The old political battles that have consumed humankind during most of the twentieth century-black versus white, Left versus Right, male versus female-will fade into the background. The only battle still worth fighting and winning, the only one that can set us free, is The People versus The Corporate Cool Machine.</p> <p>We will strike by unswooshing America TM , by organizing resistance against the power trust that owns and manages that brand. Like Marlboro and Nike, America TM has splashed its logo everywhere. And now resistance to that brand is about to begin on an unprecedented scale. We will uncool its fashions and celebrities, its icons, signs and spectacles. We will jam its image factory until the day it comes to a sudden, shuddering halt. And then on the ruins of the old consumer culture, we will build a new one with a noncommercial heart and soul.</p> <p>It will be an enormous culture jam, a protracted war of ideas, ideologies and visions of the future. It may take a generation or even more. But it will be done. This book is dedicated to explaining how.</p> <p>[...]</p> <p>If it does nothing else, I hope this book gives you pause. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope it serves as what the Situationists called a detournement - a perspective-jarring turnabout in your everyday life.</p> <p><strong>Excerpted from Culture Jam by Kalle Lasn, Copyright \u00a9 1999 by Kalle Lasn.

      "bodyText": "Part two: The Manchurian consumer: are you authentic? Part three: Posthuman: life in cyberspace Part four: The new activism (fire in the belly) The book you're holding carries a message that your first instinct will be to distrust. That message is, We can change the world. It's risky these days to make such a promise because it sounds like one of those meaningless \"awaken the inner giant\" - type bromides: If you can dream it, you can do it,\" \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\" and so on. But it's true. We're serious. We call ourselves culture jammers. We're a loose global network of media activists who see ourselves as the advance shock troops of the most significant social movement of the next twenty years. Our aim is to topple existing power structures and forge major adjustments to the way we will live in the twenty-first century. We believe culture jamming will become to our era what civil rights was to the 60s, what feminism was to the 70s, what environmental activism was to the 80s. It will alter the way we live and think. It will change the way information flows, the way institutions wield power, the way TV stations are run, the way the food, fashion, automobile, sports, music and culture industries set their agendas. Above all, it will change the way we interact with the mass media and the way in which meaning is produced in our society. We are a very diverse tribe. Our people range from born-again Lefties to Green entrepreneurs to fundamentalist Christians who don't like what television is doing to their kids; from punk anarchists to communications professors to advertising executives searching for a new role in life. Many of us are longtime activists who in the midst of our best efforts suddenly felt spiritually winded. For us feminism had run out of steam, the environmental movement no longer excited, the fire no longer burned in the belly of the Left, and youth rebellion was looking more and more like an empty gesture inspired by Nike. We were losing. Then we had an idea. Maybe if we banged together the heads of all these activists and reconfigured the fragmented forces of identity politics into a new, empowered movement, we could start winning again. We weren't looking for it necessarily, but each one of us in our own way has had a political awakening; a series of very personal \"moments of truth\" about ourselves and how the world works. For some, these insights have come on like powerful, secular epiphanies. Sometimes they have been triggered by things we overheard or read or stumbled upon. Sometimes they have involved things we thought we knew but now, suddenly, felt. These truths have left us shaken; it's no exaggeration to say they have changed our lives. I'd like to share with you some of the insights that have occurred to me over the last decade or so. America is no longer a country. It's a multitrillion-dollar brand. America TM is essentially no different from McDonald's, Marlboro or General Motors. It's an image \"sold\" not only to the citizens of the U.S.A., but to consumers worldwide. The American brand is associated with catchwords such as \"democracy,\" \"opportunity\" and \"freedom.\" But like cigarettes that are sold as symbols of vitality and youthful rebellion, the American reality is very different from its brand image. America Tm has been subverted by corporate agendas. Its elected officials bow before corporate power as a condition of their survival in office. A collective sense of powerlessness and disillusionment has set in. A deeply felt sense of betrayal is brewing. American culture is no longer created by the people. Our stories, once passed from one generation to the next by parents, neighbors and teachers, are now told by distant corporations with \"something to sell as well as to tell.\" Brands, products, fashions, celebrities, entertainments the spectacles that surround the production of culture-are our culture now. Our role is mostly to listen and watch - and then, based on what we have heard and seen, to buy. A free, authentic life is no longer possible in America TM today. We are being manipulated in the most insidious way. Our emotions, personalities and core values are under siege from media and cultural forces too complex to decode. A continuous product message has woven itself into the very fabric of our existence. Most North Americans now live designer lives - sleep, eat, sit in car, work, shop, watch TV, sleep again. I doubt there's more than a handful of free, spontaneous minutes anywhere in that cycle. We ourselves have been branded. The human spirit of prideful contrariness and fierce independence has been oddly tamed. We have evolved into a smile-button culture. We wear the trendiest fashions, drive the best cars industry can produce and project an image of incredible affluence-cool people living life to the hilt. But behind that happy mask is a face so ugly it invariably shocks the hell out of my friends from developing countries who come to visit, expecting the giddy Americana depicted on TV and finding instead a horror show of disconnection and anomie. Our mass media dispense a kind of Huxleyan \"Soma.\" The most powerful narcotic in the world is the promise of belonging. And belonging is best achieved by conforming to the prescriptions of America TM . In this way a perverted sense of cool takes hold of the imaginations of our children. And thus a heavily manipulative corporate ethos drives our Culture. Cool is indispensable - and readily, endlessly dispensed. You can get it on every corner (for the right price), though it's highly addictive and its effects are short-lived. If you're here for cool today, you'll almost certainly be back for more tomorrow. American cool is a global pandemic. Communities, traditions, cultural heritages, sovereignties, whole histories are being replaced by a barren American monoculture. Living in Japan during its period of sharpest transition to a western way of life, I was astonished by the speed and force with which the American brand took hold. I saw a culture with thousands of years of tradition behind it vanquished in two generations. Suddenly, high school girls were selling themselves after class for $150 a trick so they'd have cash to buy American jeans and handbags. The Earth can no longer support the lifestyle of the coolhunting American-style consumer. We have sought, bought, spewed and devoured too much, too fast, too brazenly, and now we're about to pay. Economic \"progress\" is killing the planet. This did not fully hit home for me until 1989, when a spate of nightmarish environmental stories suddenly appeared on the news: acid rain, dying seals in the North Sea, medical waste washing up on New York beaches, garbage barges turned away from port after port, a growing hole in the ozone layer, and the discovery that the milk in American mothers' breasts had four times the amount of DDT permitted in cow's milk. In that year a critical mass of people saw the light and became \"environmentalists.\" We were witnessing the spectre of a whole planet heading for ruin. To people like me for whom time had always seemed like a constant, eternally moving train which people got on and, seventy years later, got off, it was the end of innocence. The premonition of ecocide -planetary death- became real for the first time, and it terrified me. It still does. Once you experience even a few of these \"moments of truth,\" things can never be the same again. Your life veers off in strange new directions. It's very exciting and a little scary. Ideas blossom into obsessions. The imperative to live life differently keeps building until the day it breaks through the surface. When it happened to me I was in my neighbourhood supermarket parking lot. I was plugging a coin into a shopping cart when it suddenly occurred to me just what a dope I was. Here I was putting in my quarter for the privilege of spending money in a store I come to every week but hate, a sterile chain store that rarely carries any locally grown produce and always makes me stand in line to pay. And when I was finished shopping I'd have to take this cart back to the exact place their efficiency experts have decreed, and slide it back in with all the other carts, rehook it and push the red button to get my damn quarter back. A little internal fuse blew. I stopped moving. I glanced around to make sure no one was watching. Then I reached for that big bent coin I'd been carrying in my pocket and I rammed it as hard as I could into the coin slot. And then with the lucky Buddha charm on my keyring I banged that coin in tight until it jammed. I didn't stop to analyze whether this was ethical or not - I just let my anger flow. And then I walked away from that supermarket and headed for the little fruit and vegetable store down the road. I felt more alive than I had in months. Much later I realized I had stumbled on one of the great secrets of modern urban existence: Honor your instincts. Let your anger out. When it wells up suddenly from deep in your gut, don't suppress it channel it, trust it, use it. Don't be so unthinkingly civil all the time. When the system is grinding you down, unplug the grinding wheel. Once you start thinking and acting this way, once you realize that consumer capitalism is by its very nature unethical, and therefore it's not unethical to jam it; once you understand that civil disobedience has a long and honorable history that goes back to Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Henry David Thoreau; once you start trusting yourself and relating to the world as an empowered human being instead of a hapless consumer drone, something remarkable happens. Your cynicism dissolves. If cool is the Huxleyan \"soma\" of our time, then cynicism is its poisonous, paralytic side effect. It is the dark side of cool. It's part of the reason we watch too much TV and don't bother to vote. It's why we get stuck year after year in tedious, meaningless jobs. It's why we're bored so much of the time and become compulsive shoppers. To find a way out of cynicism is to find a way out of the postmodern malaise. On the far side of cynicism lies freedom. And the pursuit of freedom is what revolutions - and this book-are all about. The Situationists saw this revolution coming long ago. The French philosophical movement that inspired the 1968 Paris riots predicted what might happen to a society driven by consumer capitalism. The Situationists intuited how hard it would be to hang on to one's core self in a \"society of spectacle,\" a world of manufactured desires and manipulated emotions. Guy Debord, the leader of the Situationist movement, said: \"Revolution is not showing life to people, but making them live.\" This instinct to be free and unfettered is hard-wired into each one of us. It's a drive as strong as sex or hunger, an irresistible force that, once harnessed, is almost impossible to stop. With that irresistible force on our side, we will strike. We will strike by smashing the postmodern hall of mirrors and redefining what it means to be alive. We will reframe the battle in the grandest terms. The old political battles that have consumed humankind during most of the twentieth century-black versus white, Left versus Right, male versus female-will fade into the background. The only battle still worth fighting and winning, the only one that can set us free, is The People versus The Corporate Cool Machine. We will strike by unswooshing America TM , by organizing resistance against the power trust that owns and manages that brand. Like Marlboro and Nike, America TM has splashed its logo everywhere. And now resistance to that brand is about to begin on an unprecedented scale. We will uncool its fashions and celebrities, its icons, signs and spectacles. We will jam its image factory until the day it comes to a sudden, shuddering halt. And then on the ruins of the old consumer culture, we will build a new one with a noncommercial heart and soul. It will be an enormous culture jam, a protracted war of ideas, ideologies and visions of the future. It may take a generation or even more. But it will be done. This book is dedicated to explaining how. [...] If it does nothing else, I hope this book gives you pause. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope it serves as what the Situationists called a detournement - a perspective-jarring turnabout in your everyday life.

      "body": "<p>Stepping into Lord Alli's outer office is like entering an aviary filled with tropical birds. Staff twitter busily when their leader emerges: \"Is my tie straight?\" he inquires of one specimen, whose particularly striking plumage radiates as the noble one leans forward. Of course the tie - steely blue, white polka dots - is perfectly set, but it gets adjusted anyway. </p> <p>Alli may be about the same height as Benny, the hapless caretaker in Crossroads, the soap which he reveals he plans to resurrect for ITV, but you'd be unlikely to catch him in a threadbare woolly hat. </p> <p>He doesn't do photo-shoots (or interviews, for that matter) very often, but today is special. It is a year since Alli sold the independent production company he ran with his partner Charlie Parsons and the musician Bob Geldof to Carlton for a tidy few million, taking an office on the ITV company's executive floor in the process. Many scoffed at the \u00a315m price tag, deriding Carlton for wasting its money on a one-programme company. But Carlton was not just after The Big Breakfast: when it landed on Planet 24, its prey was Waheed Alli. </p> <p>Carlton's nest was in desperate need of rebuilding. It had swallowed up Central, Westcountry, and had its greedy eye on dishes abroad. It was oozing creative talent, but lacking in outlets for the creativity. As broadcasters began to realise that content was king, Carlton saw that it didn't have nearly enough of it. Alli's brief was to impose a strict workout regime. </p> <p>For the past year, he has been quietly busying himself with sorting the mess out. As director of production, he has is in charge of easing Planet into the Carlton fold, integrating the disparate web activities with Carlton's broadcast activities and eyeing up potential new acquisitions. He has worked fanatically hard, building up a creative team and giving Carlton productions a sense of direction. All that and being a lord as well. </p> <p>Now he is emerging from the fifth floor at 101 St Martin's Lane to shout about Carlton. He launches a re-make of The Railway Children today, and more drama and entertainment series will begin to roll out soon. </p> <p>Alli is desperately excited about remaking Crossroads. \"I want to do a soap. I very, very badly want to get that slot vacated by Home and Away.\" </p> <p>He sees Carlton's production facilities at Nottingham as the ideal place to build the new Crossroads motel (or Holiday Inn Express, or whatever) - perhaps even giving an opportunity for a tourist moneyspinner like Granada's Coronation Street theme park in Manchester. </p> <p>The new show would not make vast amounts of money for Carlton, but Alli recognises that the company will come of age with a soap success. \"I do think it is one of those company ambitions, it's kind of a goal within Carlton. It would be quite nice just to get it done and out of the way. I don't think that in the economics of our programme-making business, in terms of the bottom line, it's a significant thing one way or another.\" </p> <p>With Crossroads, he is making a high-profile and inspired pitch for the ITV soap slot vacated by Channel 5's dawn raid on Home and Away - although he also has a second soap idea up his sleeve. Work has begun on a celebrity karaoke vehicle for ITV's new stars Denise Van Outen and Ian Wright, provisionally titled Cover Story and featuring celebrities singing their favourite songs. There is a series for Lily Savage (\"hysterically funny\"), and in drama (\"a vibrant area of activity\") the return of Big Bad World. Remakes are clearly his thing: a new production of Captain Scarlet is also possible. And Carlton stalwarts such as Peak Practice and Family Fortunes are safe. \"Content really is king, and we all worship ideas. Because in the end, that's what pays.\" </p> <p>Alli is keen to point out that Carlton's share of ITV network commissions is increasing; but the trouble is, no one gives it credit. He is determined that this will change. \"In every schedule on every major channel I can see our creative footprints, because everything we do is creatively brave.\" </p> <p>He has an uphill task. When Carlton entered the ITV big time, snatching the London weekday franchise from a complacent Thames in 1991, it did so on the promise that it would be a \"publisher broadcaster\". That is, it would simply buy in programmes from outside and put them on the air. It was cheap, and because it encouraged the growth of the independent TV production market in Britain, it pleased the prime mover behind the licence auction, Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>But times have changed. Without a programme library of its own to syndicate around the world, Carlton would always remain a bit player. Chairman Michael Green began to see the light, and embarked on the dual strategy of buying up libraries and strong production houses such as Central. It seemed, however, that Carlton didn't really know what to do with it all. </p> <p>Enter Alli, charged with the task of \"joining it all up\". It has not been an easy process, not least for one or two people who thought they were doing this already. Just six months earlier, Carlton had poached Steve Hewlett, a highly respected former editor of BBC1's Panorama, and installed him as director of programmes. Now here was the upstart from Planet 24 installed as director of production. The two jobs appeared to be so similar that it there was much talk of a Hewlett walk-out. </p> <p>Alli might have been expected to dodge the \"how have you got on with Steve\" question. Indeed, there is a sense that, for a moment at least, he is considering a sideways step. He snatches a glance around his office - minimalist, blond wood, modern art (more dots). He goes for the honest approach. \"When I first came in, I think, there was a feeling of 'what does he do, what do I do, are we running the same organisation, are we stepping on each others' toes?' I'm sure on one or two occasions I have stepped on his toes and he has on mine. But I think, as the year has gone on, the scale of my ambition about what we can be doing here and the plans and the strategy unfold, you'll find I'm not treading on his toes, I don't run his area, I run a division, Carlton television productions.\" </p> <p>This is one of only two points in an hour-long interview where he appears uneasy - clearly there have been tensions between the pair. But Hewlett has had success of his own - the highly acclaimed Second World War in Colour series was his baby - and appears to have ridden it out. In any case, Carlton makes sure its executives are locked in with lucrative share options. </p> <p>Alli believes he has successfully negotiated the potential flashpoint. \"I hope I have given him the space to continue to do his job, and I don't think he feels hemmed in.\" He pauses for a split second, as if unsure. \"I hope he doesn't, anyway.\" </p> <p>Pitfalls aside, he feels he is making a mark. \"I'm quite strong-willed and I think I know what I want. I think that in the first year I've been here, I've managed to make the changes I wanted without too much damage.\" </p> <p>Known for his ability to schmooze the talent, he appears very popular with most staff. Few have a bad word to say about him. He works them hard, but he rewards them too, and has tried to make their creative lives easier: they are there to make brilliant programmes, not to fill in forms. His mission has been to \"liberate them from an institution\". \"Understanding the frustrations of people means you can be their champion in a corporation, and allow them to do their jobs better. That's what I've tried to do, to champion the cause of the creative in an organisation that, I have to say, wants to respond to it.\" </p> <p>For the past year, Carlton has taken up most of Alli's time. But despite insisting that he is Carlton \"through and through\", he hasn't been quick to remove his fingers from his many other pies. New Labour ennoblement has given him a platform for his political interests and he has taken a particularly strong line in the Lords debates over Section 28. Showing dedication beyond the cause, he took tea with arch-Conservative Baroness Young, but even the famed Alli charm could not win her over. </p> <p>He has been working on his business interests, too. In last week's Media Guardian, he advertised the post of a chief executive for a new \"gay dot.com\" company. It was striking not just for the package on offer (\u00a3150,000pa and stock options), but also for his choice of address for applications: House of Lords, SW1. As many pointed out last week, it's against the rules to run a business from parliament - but Alli insists that he is doing nothing of the sort. And he is particularly incensed by any suggestion that he is doing otherwise. \"I clearly don't run a business from there. There are peers that use the House of Lords as their primary workplace; I'm not one of them. There aren't very many things the House of Lords provides: it certainly doesn't provide you with a desk, a phone and a place to sit - and you're supposed to be scrutinising legislation.\" </p> <p>Obviously not: there is a letter rack stacked with House of Lords notepaper in his Carlton office. \"The reason why I use the House of Lords as a mailing address, to be honest, is that we've all been subject to racist and homophobic attacks in the past.\" </p> <p>As an explanation, it's sound - but note that curious flight into the plural. Previously, though keen to stress that Carlton is a team effort by name-dropping the key players in a gracious attempt to share the credit, he has basked in the supreme confidence of \"I\". Now, Alli seeks safety in numbers - and his syntax begins to break up. It is his only betrayal of vulnerability. </p> <p>\"Our advice has been that mail sent to us at the House of Lords is screened and checked by the police, and if you are in the gay arena, and you have been doing as much work as I have done on section 28, there has been some pretty horrific stuff that has come through. And with a gay dot.com it was felt that the best place to put it would be where my mail was security screened. </p> <p>\"It is very important to understand that, in public life, people are subject to a whole range of abusive and violent threats, and this is the way we deal with it.\" </p> <p>Alli is on safer ground when talking about his favourite subject: television (the future of). The proposed merger with United, the ITV franchisee and publisher of the Express newspaper, is currently deep in regulatory mire. But he is desperate for it to succeed - consolidation is the only way ahead for independent broadcasters in Britain, he believes. \"My worry is that if we're not careful we're going to spend all our time fighting a UK battle between companies while the rest of the world's media companies are positioning themselves to be global media players.\" </p> <p>So a single ITV is not only inevitable, it is positively desirable. And Alli wants to be in there when it happens. At 35, it doesn't need to happen any time soon. Clearly, he fancies himself as a bit of a media mogul. \"I desperately want to be in there. I hope I will be involved in the managing of that process in one way or the other and part of whatever new company that comes about.\" </p> <p>His eyes twinkle: \"I think I have age on my side.\" </p> <p><strong>Life and times of Waheed Alli</strong></p> <p><strong> Age:</strong> 35. </p> <p><strong> Contacts:</strong> Tony uses him as his youth sounding-board.

      "bodyText": "Stepping into Lord Alli's outer office is like entering an aviary filled with tropical birds. Staff twitter busily when their leader emerges: \"Is my tie straight?\" he inquires of one specimen, whose particularly striking plumage radiates as the noble one leans forward. Of course the tie - steely blue, white polka dots - is perfectly set, but it gets adjusted anyway. Alli may be about the same height as Benny, the hapless caretaker in Crossroads, the soap which he reveals he plans to resurrect for ITV, but you'd be unlikely to catch him in a threadbare woolly hat. He doesn't do photo-shoots (or interviews, for that matter) very often, but today is special. It is a year since Alli sold the independent production company he ran with his partner Charlie Parsons and the musician Bob Geldof to Carlton for a tidy few million, taking an office on the ITV company's executive floor in the process. Many scoffed at the \u00a315m price tag, deriding Carlton for wasting its money on a one-programme company. But Carlton was not just after The Big Breakfast: when it landed on Planet 24, its prey was Waheed Alli. Carlton's nest was in desperate need of rebuilding. It had swallowed up Central, Westcountry, and had its greedy eye on dishes abroad. It was oozing creative talent, but lacking in outlets for the creativity. As broadcasters began to realise that content was king, Carlton saw that it didn't have nearly enough of it. Alli's brief was to impose a strict workout regime. For the past year, he has been quietly busying himself with sorting the mess out. As director of production, he has is in charge of easing Planet into the Carlton fold, integrating the disparate web activities with Carlton's broadcast activities and eyeing up potential new acquisitions. He has worked fanatically hard, building up a creative team and giving Carlton productions a sense of direction. All that and being a lord as well. Now he is emerging from the fifth floor at 101 St Martin's Lane to shout about Carlton. He launches a re-make of The Railway Children today, and more drama and entertainment series will begin to roll out soon. Alli is desperately excited about remaking Crossroads. \"I want to do a soap. I very, very badly want to get that slot vacated by Home and Away.\" He sees Carlton's production facilities at Nottingham as the ideal place to build the new Crossroads motel (or Holiday Inn Express, or whatever) - perhaps even giving an opportunity for a tourist moneyspinner like Granada's Coronation Street theme park in Manchester. The new show would not make vast amounts of money for Carlton, but Alli recognises that the company will come of age with a soap success. \"I do think it is one of those company ambitions, it's kind of a goal within Carlton. It would be quite nice just to get it done and out of the way. I don't think that in the economics of our programme-making business, in terms of the bottom line, it's a significant thing one way or another.\" With Crossroads, he is making a high-profile and inspired pitch for the ITV soap slot vacated by Channel 5's dawn raid on Home and Away - although he also has a second soap idea up his sleeve. Work has begun on a celebrity karaoke vehicle for ITV's new stars Denise Van Outen and Ian Wright, provisionally titled Cover Story and featuring celebrities singing their favourite songs. There is a series for Lily Savage (\"hysterically funny\"), and in drama (\"a vibrant area of activity\") the return of Big Bad World. Remakes are clearly his thing: a new production of Captain Scarlet is also possible. And Carlton stalwarts such as Peak Practice and Family Fortunes are safe. \"Content really is king, and we all worship ideas. Because in the end, that's what pays.\" Alli is keen to point out that Carlton's share of ITV network commissions is increasing; but the trouble is, no one gives it credit. He is determined that this will change. \"In every schedule on every major channel I can see our creative footprints, because everything we do is creatively brave.\" He has an uphill task. When Carlton entered the ITV big time, snatching the London weekday franchise from a complacent Thames in 1991, it did so on the promise that it would be a \"publisher broadcaster\". That is, it would simply buy in programmes from outside and put them on the air. It was cheap, and because it encouraged the growth of the independent TV production market in Britain, it pleased the prime mover behind the licence auction, Margaret Thatcher. But times have changed. Without a programme library of its own to syndicate around the world, Carlton would always remain a bit player. Chairman Michael Green began to see the light, and embarked on the dual strategy of buying up libraries and strong production houses such as Central. It seemed, however, that Carlton didn't really know what to do with it all. Enter Alli, charged with the task of \"joining it all up\". It has not been an easy process, not least for one or two people who thought they were doing this already. Just six months earlier, Carlton had poached Steve Hewlett, a highly respected former editor of BBC1's Panorama, and installed him as director of programmes. Now here was the upstart from Planet 24 installed as director of production. The two jobs appeared to be so similar that it there was much talk of a Hewlett walk-out. Alli might have been expected to dodge the \"how have you got on with Steve\" question. Indeed, there is a sense that, for a moment at least, he is considering a sideways step. He snatches a glance around his office - minimalist, blond wood, modern art (more dots). He goes for the honest approach. \"When I first came in, I think, there was a feeling of 'what does he do, what do I do, are we running the same organisation, are we stepping on each others' toes?' I'm sure on one or two occasions I have stepped on his toes and he has on mine. But I think, as the year has gone on, the scale of my ambition about what we can be doing here and the plans and the strategy unfold, you'll find I'm not treading on his toes, I don't run his area, I run a division, Carlton television productions.\" This is one of only two points in an hour-long interview where he appears uneasy - clearly there have been tensions between the pair. But Hewlett has had success of his own - the highly acclaimed Second World War in Colour series was his baby - and appears to have ridden it out. In any case, Carlton makes sure its executives are locked in with lucrative share options. Alli believes he has successfully negotiated the potential flashpoint. \"I hope I have given him the space to continue to do his job, and I don't think he feels hemmed in.\" He pauses for a split second, as if unsure. \"I hope he doesn't, anyway.\" Pitfalls aside, he feels he is making a mark. \"I'm quite strong-willed and I think I know what I want. I think that in the first year I've been here, I've managed to make the changes I wanted without too much damage.\" Known for his ability to schmooze the talent, he appears very popular with most staff.

Until two weeks ago, he was managing director of Cabal, the magazine company he founded with Sally O'Sullivan in August 1998 in a blaze of defiance and optimism. \"When you are small, you need luck,\" he observes. \"Competing with IPC and Emap is not the easiest thing in the world. It's true that 'All's fair in love and war'. It was very hard.\" </p> <p>Sutcliffe, the second - and highest profile - of the four founding directors to quit, is speaking from his girlfriend's house in Highgate. He is sitting out his notice and pondering his next move, diplomatically vague on details such as what to do with his Cabal share options. </p> <p>In its short but intensely scrutinised life, Cabal, which now publishes two successful monthly glossies - lads' mag Front and lifestyle read Real Homes - has generated more media interest than all its big established rivals put together. Proof of how we love a tale of David taking on Goliath? Perhaps. But also because we like to see big egos with big plans colliding with reality. </p> <p>Sutcliffe acted camera-shy during the episode that really propelled Cabal into the wider public eye - Trouble Between the Covers. This four-part BBC2 business series, screened in January, was hijacked by Front's editor, Piers Hernu, but painted an extraordinary, partial portrait of life within Cabal's squashed offices on the Euston Road, central London, during its first year. </p> <p>It included the departure of another founder director, Helen Brocklebank, when the company failed to land a big contract magazine for Boots, losing out to one of the sector's titans. But, since filming stopped last August, it also failed to update with some better news. There were good audited circulation figures for the monthlies in February and an increase in turnover to around \u00a310m a year. Front is selling 141,000 copies a month, and Real Homes 131,000. </p> <p>A compensatory move into internet publishing is also under way. Cabal has won the contract to supply the editorial content for a food and drink site for Sainsbury's - although the launch may be affected by the supermarket's new management - and has a clutch of other internet projects in hand. </p> <p>On the surface, then, O'Sullivan's declaration that the TV series did more good - in terms of publicity - than harm has proved correct. But then there's Sutcliffe sat in his girlfriend's front room. Jonathan Rose, the company's new media specialist publishing director, has also left suddenly; and Hernu's scene-stealing screen charisma has, over the past few weeks, led him to be connected with practically every job going; from the Loaded editorship to a six-month development contract with independent producers Bazal and a number of TV presenting roles. </p> <p>Sutcliffe parries questions about why he left with the reply: \"I felt very close to Cabal. But I also feel very close to my career.\" His former partner O'Sullivan says, \"He was absolutely fundamental and instrumental in starting the company. You have to adapt to the life-stage of a company.\" He is not being replaced. </p> <p>Leaving, he says, was his decision. \"I felt there was a great big world out there: the internet, a million and one opportunities. One problem with working for a small company is that there were fairly limited opportunities. Yet it is a time when there is almost a once in a lifetime opportunity for editorial people who know about content. I didn't want that to pass me by.\" </p> <p>A new company clearly has to be very selective, because there is no margin for error. A key moment of truth arrived last year, when advanced plans for a big weekly crime magazine were hastily ditched, as IPC threatened a spoiler. It also led to observations in the specialist press that the big publishers have delighted in ganging up to bully the upstart. </p> <p>To get any presence with a new magazine on overcrowded news stands, Sutcliffe muses, sales need to be around 100,000, the mags have to carry \"cover mounts\" (free gifts) and cut prices. The cost, including marketing, is likely to be somewhere between \u00a33-\u00a34m. </p> <p>\"The problem is that you have to invest something to get something,\" says Sutcliffe. Had Cabal, with its slender start-up funds, underestimated the problems? \"I don't think we went into it naively,\" he says, but he clearly found the small scale business difficult. \"One day you are doing very executive-ish sorts of things, next unblocking the toilets or taking a midnight call saying that the company is being burgled. In bigger companies your role is more precisely defined.\" </p> <p>When O'Sullivan launched, she talked big, as one does to cause a stir. Not just of starting a range of perhaps a dozen titles, but producing them in a magazine utopia, by a family-style team who would even be allowed to take days off - called \"mental health days\" - when wanted. There were few job titles, and an atmosphere of informality. </p> <p>She was also leading a breakaway from IPC, at a point when a successfully negotiated management buy-out had stopped short of including the key editorial figures. Sutcliffe had worked alongside her at IPC for seven years, rising to group editor, music and sports (he was originally editor of Cycling Weekly and brought two cycling titles to Cabal). </p> <p>Rose, who helped set up the deal with Sainsbury's and set up Cabal's Pro-Cycling website, says the fact the chain chose Cabal rather than its rivals was a big coup and reflected the fact that O'Sullivan has the editorial teams to supply content. (Sarah Bravo, former editor of Real Homes, is spearheading the team). </p> <p>He remains sympathetic to Cabal's trials. \"I don't think Sally's been given the credit she deserves,\" he says. Insiders say that it has all been much more difficult than expected, putting O'Sullivan under huge pressure, although she has clearly adapted her plans to new conditions. Even the BBC film-makers said that they wished they had time to make an extra film, to describe what happens when the utopian dream collapses under 12-hour days. </p> <p>Where does Cabal's future lie? From outside, Rose thinks it has a definite niche as an independent publisher: \"There is space for all sizes, the future is good. They are very good at designing, things.\" Meanwhile, Sutcliffe outlines other options: Cabal can go it alone, or it may be acquired because of the good people it employs. The problem for a publisher of just two or three titles is that it's not the way to strike the best printing and paper deals. \"Most of the major publishers have very broad portfolios,\" he concludes. </p> <p>But O'Sullivan continues to fight on. A resilient media player (described by Sutcliffe as having \"limitless contacts\"), she says that if she's made one mistake it was by not concentrating all efforts on the big two titles, rather than trying to add smaller titles as well. \"It is difficult being small. I agree with Andy,\" she says. \"You have to move more slowly. In an ideal world, I'd like to launch titles every week.\" But she has a new male lifestyle magazine, Mondo, \"a sort of 21st century Face\" due for September launch, and another women's lifestyle magazine planned. </p> <p>Plus, she sees websites as the \"natural progression\" for the company, although it was not something she foresaw two years ago. \"I see a big future there. We are small enough to do it. In future we will launch new magazines and websites together.\" </p> <p>The truth about Cabal, it seems, is that its day-to-day struggles have turned it into a standard small commercial operation, living a rather banal existence - a long way from the glamorous image the magazine world tries to project.

      "body": "<p><strong> Agony aunts are so angry</strong> they may soon need counselling themselves. Friends of Suzie Hayman, who has for seven years seen the readers of Woman's Own through thick and thin, say she has been ditched - in favour of Vanessa Feltz. </p> <p>Hayman trained with Relate and conscientiously answers unpublished letters in her own time. But a big, blonde, brassy celebrity she is not. Claire Rayner, mother of all agony aunts, is outraged at the slight to her profession. \"It shows contempt for agony aunts, and above all, for readers. A column is not there for titillation, but as a genuine service,\" she rages. What's more: \"How can they put in someone whose TV show abused people's trust, and think she's suitable for the job? You wouldn't put Feltz in to run financial pages, or as sports editor, so why this one?\" But perhaps Feltz's own highly publicised problems - broken marriage, career fightback, battle with her weight and turbulent relationship with her father - might give her an ability to empathise with troubled readers? \"It's no substitute for training,\" snaps Rayner. </p> <p><strong>Greg Dyke's sketchy reorganisation</strong> plans have left parts of the BBC in turmoil. There is disbelief that arch-Birtist Matthew Bannister has been handed director of marketing and communication, over the corporation's marketing supremo, Sue Farr. Farr has now been mentioned in connection with the (still) vacant chief executive post at ITV. Meanwhile, those confirmed in charge of the new divisions have been given until June to come up with plans for hirings, firings and departmental structuring, but no one knows how to get one of the top jobs left unfilled - heading all factual and learning programming. Will the post be advertised? Or will the two new acting heads, Lorraine Heggessey and Michael Stevenson, simply be placed in a padded ring with weapons until a victor emerges? </p> <p><strong>The organisers of last week's </strong>Newspaper 2000 Awards - gongs for newspaper production, renowned for such strange categories such as \"best implementation of computer-to-plate technology\" - showed their commitment to progressive thinking appropriate to the new millennium by relying on an all-male jury. One decision of this blokeish cabal prompted an outbreak of uncynical and uncontained delight, when Cage &amp; Aviary Birds beat such illustrious titles as the TLS and THES to win the special interest newspaper of the year award. \"This is just like being on Have I Got News For You,\" winked compere Clive Anderson, before wondering whether the editor won a year's supply of millet along with the handsome plaque. </p> <p><strong>The misery continues at the</strong> once-great Scotsman, still haemorrhaging staff apace under Andrew Neil, the Barclay brothers' press supremo. In the last few months, the paper has lost (or sacked) an editor, a deputy editor, an assistant editor (politics), an associate editor (pictures), a news editor, a features editor and a business editor. It has not replaced the home affairs correspondent after the incumbent was promoted, and the environment correspondent and Europe correspondent are also heading for the door as of late last week. The Dundee and Stirling district offices had already been closed. New appointees have either made their names in television or south of the border. \"It seems the qualification for a new job at Scotland's national newspaper is to be English or know bugger all about newspapers - preferably both,\" said our man in a kilt.</p> <p>\u0095 You can contact Maggie Brown at <a href=\"'mailto:maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com'\">maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com</a></p>",

Friends of Suzie Hayman, who has for seven years seen the readers of Woman's Own through thick and thin, say she has been ditched - in favour of Vanessa Feltz. Hayman trained with Relate and conscientiously answers unpublished letters in her own time. But a big, blonde, brassy celebrity she is not. Claire Rayner, mother of all agony aunts, is outraged at the slight to her profession. \"It shows contempt for agony aunts, and above all, for readers. A column is not there for titillation, but as a genuine service,\" she rages. What's more: \"How can they put in someone whose TV show abused people's trust, and think she's suitable for the job? You wouldn't put Feltz in to run financial pages, or as sports editor, so why this one?\" But perhaps Feltz's own highly publicised problems - broken marriage, career fightback, battle with her weight and turbulent relationship with her father - might give her an ability to empathise with troubled readers? \"It's no substitute for training,\" snaps Rayner. Greg Dyke's sketchy reorganisation plans have left parts of the BBC in turmoil. There is disbelief that arch-Birtist Matthew Bannister has been handed director of marketing and communication, over the corporation's marketing supremo, Sue Farr. Farr has now been mentioned in connection with the (still) vacant chief executive post at ITV. Meanwhile, those confirmed in charge of the new divisions have been given until June to come up with plans for hirings, firings and departmental structuring, but no one knows how to get one of the top jobs left unfilled - heading all factual and learning programming. Will the post be advertised? Or will the two new acting heads, Lorraine Heggessey and Michael Stevenson, simply be placed in a padded ring with weapons until a victor emerges? The organisers of last week's Newspaper 2000 Awards - gongs for newspaper production, renowned for such strange categories such as \"best implementation of computer-to-plate technology\" - showed their commitment to progressive thinking appropriate to the new millennium by relying on an all-male jury. One decision of this blokeish cabal prompted an outbreak of uncynical and uncontained delight, when Cage &amp; Aviary Birds beat such illustrious titles as the TLS and THES to win the special interest newspaper of the year award. \"This is just like being on Have I Got News For You,\" winked compere Clive Anderson, before wondering whether the editor won a year's supply of millet along with the handsome plaque. The misery continues at the once-great Scotsman, still haemorrhaging staff apace under Andrew Neil, the Barclay brothers' press supremo. In the last few months, the paper has lost (or sacked) an editor, a deputy editor, an assistant editor (politics), an associate editor (pictures), a news editor, a features editor and a business editor. It has not replaced the home affairs correspondent after the incumbent was promoted, and the environment correspondent and Europe correspondent are also heading for the door as of late last week. The Dundee and Stirling district offices had already been closed. New appointees have either made their names in television or south of the border. \"It seems the qualification for a new job at Scotland's national newspaper is to be English or know bugger all about newspapers - preferably both,\" said our man in a kilt. \u0095 You can contact Maggie Brown at maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com",

About the birth a year later of his son Martin he was at first more benign. </p> <p>\"Less horrifying in appearance,\" he told his friend Philip Larkin, but with \"one of the most protesting faces I ever saw\". </p> <p>These affectionate gibes continued as Martin rose to fame as a writer almost 30 years later. \"Did I tell you Martin is spending a year abroad as TAX EXILE?\" Amis asked Larkin in May 1979. \"Last year he earned \u00a338,000. Little shit. 29, he is. Little shit.\" </p> <p>In 1981 he was critical of Martin's narrative technique: \"Young Martin's new novel [Other People] is out. Tough going, I find. You see, there's this girl with amnesia... so she's forgotten what a lavatory is and thinks the cistern and pipes are statuary. But then how does she know what statuary is?\" </p> <p>By 1986 it had become political. \"Talking of Martin... he has gone all lefty and of the crappiest neutralist kind .... in fact going on like H Pinter does these days, I hear... the worse, far worse, for having come to it late - nearly 37, not 17.\" </p> <p>These fatherly barbs, from a man who took care to cultivate his image as the \"Old Devil\" of English literature in the late 20th century, are disclosed in 700 of his selected letters to be published on May 15 in a 1,200-page book. </p> <p>The book also includes his reaction to Margaret Thatcher's first election victory in 1979: \"Bloody good, eh? Not only that she got in but that those who were pushed out were pushed out... that shouting bully Pardoe [John Pardoe, senior Liberal MP] and that tousle-haired totalitarian Shirley Williams. </p> <p>\"I bet she rued the day she turned up on the Grunwick picket line.\" </p> <p>The letters will appear almost simultaneously with Martin Amis's autobiography, Experience: a Memoir, to be serialised exclusively next month in the Guardian. </p> <p>Martin Amis, now 50, has published nine novels and two collections of short stories. Sir Kingsley Amis, who died aged 73 in 1995, published 23 novels including the classic Lucky Jim. He said: \"I would like to be remembered for making people laugh.\" </p> <p>Letters that the Mail on Sunday began serialising yesterday are almost all to Larkin, a lifelong friend. Close followers of his work are likely to take some of the harsher views in them with a pinch of salt. </p> <p>Amis and Larkin were adolescent companions at Oxford, drawn together by a mutually iconoclastic sense of fun, a taste for jazz and alcohol and Amis's gift for mimicry.

      "bodyText": "\"My little son,\" the novelist Kingsley Amis wrote of his firstborn, \"has a face like that of an ageing railway porter who is beginning to realise his untidiness means he'll never get that ticket-collector's job he's been after for 28 years.\" That was about his son Philip. About the birth a year later of his son Martin he was at first more benign. \"Less horrifying in appearance,\" he told his friend Philip Larkin, but with \"one of the most protesting faces I ever saw\". These affectionate gibes continued as Martin rose to fame as a writer almost 30 years later. \"Did I tell you Martin is spending a year abroad as TAX EXILE?\" Amis asked Larkin in May 1979. \"Last year he earned \u00a338,000. Little shit. 29, he is. Little shit.\" In 1981 he was critical of Martin's narrative technique: \"Young Martin's new novel [Other People] is out. Tough going, I find. You see, there's this girl with amnesia... so she's forgotten what a lavatory is and thinks the cistern and pipes are statuary. But then how does she know what statuary is?\" By 1986 it had become political. \"Talking of Martin... he has gone all lefty and of the crappiest neutralist kind .... in fact going on like H Pinter does these days, I hear... the worse, far worse, for having come to it late - nearly 37, not 17.\" These fatherly barbs, from a man who took care to cultivate his image as the \"Old Devil\" of English literature in the late 20th century, are disclosed in 700 of his selected letters to be published on May 15 in a 1,200-page book. The book also includes his reaction to Margaret Thatcher's first election victory in 1979: \"Bloody good, eh? Not only that she got in but that those who were pushed out were pushed out... that shouting bully Pardoe [John Pardoe, senior Liberal MP] and that tousle-haired totalitarian Shirley Williams. \"I bet she rued the day she turned up on the Grunwick picket line.\" The letters will appear almost simultaneously with Martin Amis's autobiography, Experience: a Memoir, to be serialised exclusively next month in the Guardian. Martin Amis, now 50, has published nine novels and two collections of short stories. Sir Kingsley Amis, who died aged 73 in 1995, published 23 novels including the classic Lucky Jim. He said: \"I would like to be remembered for making people laugh.\" Letters that the Mail on Sunday began serialising yesterday are almost all to Larkin, a lifelong friend. Close followers of his work are likely to take some of the harsher views in them with a pinch of salt. Amis and Larkin were adolescent companions at Oxford, drawn together by a mutually iconoclastic sense of fun, a taste for jazz and alcohol and Amis's gift for mimicry. Both got first-class degrees. As adults, they met infrequently but kept up the bond with weekly letters, vying to encourage and outdo each other in rightwing politics and with laddish remarks about women in their lives. Some of their letters are seen as of vintage quality, but another close friend of one of them has used the phrase folie \u00e0 deux about the way they egged each other on to extreme views. They wrote and spoke differently, often more humanely, to other friends. While he was still at Oxford in 1946, Amis wrote laddishly to Larkin about his future wife, Hilary Bardsley, then 17 years old. But, in this and subsequent letters, he also touched on his struggle towards a pragmatically decent moral code in his life - the underlying theme of most of his later novels, including Take a Girl Like You, I Want It Now and The Old Devils. \"The reason why I have been so long [in writing] this time is chiefly Hilary,\" he wrote. \"We have been arguing... about sleeping in the same bed. \"First she said no, and I said she would have to say yes, then she said yes, and I said I had forced her into it and what she meant was no, then she said no, and I feel hurt and angry and disappointed. \"If only one could be ruthless about these things.

      "body": "<p>Three years ago, I'd have been the last person to claim that there was any connection between my love life and that of my mother. When it came to sex, I would have put us at complete polar opposites. She was a virgin until her wedding night which, to me, is an insane, preposterous idea. To enter into a lifelong legal and emotion bond with someone you've never slept with... I mean you try on shoes before you buy them. </p> <p>My own experiences are different. I've had long-term, live-in relationships with two men and, like most other women in their late 20s, slept with others. Virginity is something I dimly remember from my teens. And marriage? Marriage doesn't even occur to me as an option; it's something women used to have to do, like wear corsets and learn embroidery. </p> <p>To her credit, my mother isn't as disapproving about my life as I am about hers. Whatever she may think, she's always been there at the end of the phone whenever I've been heartbroken, elated, disappointed, bored, moving in, moving out. </p> <p>But if you think the disparity between the sexual politics of my era and that of my mother's is a symptom of late-20th-century emancipation, you'd be far wrong. In her early 20s, my grandmother received two marriage proposals, by letter, from two trainee Methodist ministers. She hadn't so much as kissed either of them. Unsure about which to accept, she went to her mother, who in turn went to visit the head of the training college. This man gave the matter his consideration, then suggested the man who became my grandfather. This is as alien and arcane to my mother as the concept of virgin brides is to me. </p> <p>When, three years ago, I set out to write a novel, I had a clear idea in my head. I wanted to write about love. I wanted to create a precise account of exactly how it feels to fall in love with someone and lose them. I had it all planned, but when I came to setting fingers to keyboard, a strange thing happened. I found I was unable to write about my heroine's love life until I had gone into those of her mother and her grandmother. I discovered that it was impossible to explain her without discourse to her mother. This was where the germ of my novel lay. How the actions of one generation can reverberate in the next, and how a woman's life is affected by her mother's choices in love were ideas I came to recognise as the ones I wanted to follow. It meant that I had to admit to myself that, as removed from me as my mother's life may seem, it had had more effect on me than I had been prepared to acknowledge - and not only in producing a rebellious reaction against what she'd taught me. </p> <p>Once I'd recognised this correlation, I became fascinated, obsessed: I sought out books to read, I quizzed my friends for information, I eavesdropped shamelessly on conversations at cafe tables, I demanded secrets and details from near strangers. What I found out was that no woman is exempt from the influence her mother's choices can exert. </p> <p>It was about this time that I found myself in the doorway of my then boyfriend's study, opening my mouth to demand, \"Do you have to work all the time?\", when a strange feeling of displaced d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu crept over me. I could hear the words in my mother's voice. I took a mental snapshot of myself and saw a familiar stance: hands on hips, head on one side. I suddenly saw that no matter how much I'd gone out of my way to choose a man that went against my upbringing, here I was, in a situation from which I'd begun. </p> <p>My mother and I are more similar than I have ever thought. We both have easily ignited and just as easily appeased tempers. And we both like a laugh. But it's not just parts of her personality that I am programmed with. What your mother teaches you about relationships and love is your first exposure to the concept, and anything she says or tells you will irrevocably shape your views. If my mother brought up my sisters and I with any kind of maxim it was, \"never, ever hurt anyone's feelings\". Although this hasn't always stood me in good stead in today's more cut-throat sexual climate, to this day I am paralysed with guilty horror if I think I have upset someone I love. </p> <p>How much or how little your mother is prepared to disclose depends on how old you are. The biggest realignment in the mother-daughter relationship, it seems to me, occurs when the daughter reaches her late 20s. The mother's done the difficult bit, while the daughter has established her own life. </p> <p>I am getting to an age I can remember my mother at, which, I've discovered, is an unsettling milestone. What I'm seeing happening around me to friends and colleagues of a similar age is mothers who are coming out with the truth about themselves. The mother maybe thinks her daughter is old enough, or maybe she's just asking, quite justifiably, for a return on 30 years of parenting. And, for many, the past that is uncovered isn't as innocent as they had assumed. </p> <p>I had lunch with someone recently who arrived white-faced and stunned. After being plied with wine, she admitted she'd been moaning to her mother about how she was feeling jaded with the man she's been with for five years. Her mother, rather briskly and uncharacteristically, advised her to \"go off and have an affair\", relating how, 10 years into her marriage, she'd slept with a colleague several times. \"I couldn't believe it,\" my friend said. \"She said it made her realise how much she loved my father.

When it came to sex, I would have put us at complete polar opposites. She was a virgin until her wedding night which, to me, is an insane, preposterous idea. To enter into a lifelong legal and emotion bond with someone you've never slept with... I mean you try on shoes before you buy them. My own experiences are different. I've had long-term, live-in relationships with two men and, like most other women in their late 20s, slept with others. Virginity is something I dimly remember from my teens. And marriage? Marriage doesn't even occur to me as an option; it's something women used to have to do, like wear corsets and learn embroidery. To her credit, my mother isn't as disapproving about my life as I am about hers. Whatever she may think, she's always been there at the end of the phone whenever I've been heartbroken, elated, disappointed, bored, moving in, moving out.

      "body": "<p>It's Kilfoyle's revenge. Since the Liverpool MP resigned in January a succession of reports and surveys have confirmed that there are hard, enduring and structural differences in the prosperity of the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Cardiff report on competitiveness, released today, is the latest. What distinguishes it - and probably makes it all the more dismaying to read in Manchester, Swansea or Gateshead - is its future orientation. The northern regions, Wales and Northern Ireland are losing out in precisely those technologies and areas of knowledge from which the jobs and incomes of the 21st century are to come.</p> <p>Peter Kilfoyle accused the Blair government of neglecting its \"heartlands\" - the parts of the United Kingdom from which it draws its traditional support. Blair's response was that within every region there are successful towns. He is right but it is a politically weak answer. The poverty and lack of opportunity on Merseyside and Tyneside are too physically apparent to be wished away by reference to growth in Chester or Newcastle's undoubtedly successful revival as a tourist destination.</p> <p>What Kilfoyle has managed to do is put \"regional policy\" back on the map. He has revived an issue that had been consistently downgraded during the Tory era, on which Labour too had been none too keen when it took office. Whitehall is now hurriedly listing all the ways in which regional assistance is provided and Blair has become a convert to the possibility of transforming John Prescott's regional development agencies into embryonic democratic assemblies, allowing the regions to assert themselves.</p> <p>Yet the Cardiff report is a chilling reminder of the size of the gap between north and south. Central intervention on a huge scale is going to be needed to boost productivity and introduce the new communications technology into the economic bases of Wales, Yorkshire, Humberside and the northeast. The report also shows that the government is going to have to swim against the economic tide which is washing so luxuriously around London's towers.</p> <p>But there are ways in which the government can channel investment: if it invests in skills and infrastructure even the most southern-oriented company directors can be persuaded to relocate or set up a new shop in the north.</p> <p>First, however, the government is going to have to concede the truth of the Kilfoyle critique. Labour's heartlands are suffering and only the most energetic revival of regional subsidy is going to help.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's Kilfoyle's revenge. Since the Liverpool MP resigned in January a succession of reports and surveys have confirmed that there are hard, enduring and structural differences in the prosperity of the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Cardiff report on competitiveness, released today, is the latest. What distinguishes it - and probably makes it all the more dismaying to read in Manchester, Swansea or Gateshead - is its future orientation. The northern regions, Wales and Northern Ireland are losing out in precisely those technologies and areas of knowledge from which the jobs and incomes of the 21st century are to come. Peter Kilfoyle accused the Blair government of neglecting its \"heartlands\" - the parts of the United Kingdom from which it draws its traditional support. Blair's response was that within every region there are successful towns. He is right but it is a politically weak answer. The poverty and lack of opportunity on Merseyside and Tyneside are too physically apparent to be wished away by reference to growth in Chester or Newcastle's undoubtedly successful revival as a tourist destination. What Kilfoyle has managed to do is put \"regional policy\" back on the map. He has revived an issue that had been consistently downgraded during the Tory era, on which Labour too had been none too keen when it took office. Whitehall is now hurriedly listing all the ways in which regional assistance is provided and Blair has become a convert to the possibility of transforming John Prescott's regional development agencies into embryonic democratic assemblies, allowing the regions to assert themselves. Yet the Cardiff report is a chilling reminder of the size of the gap between north and south. Central intervention on a huge scale is going to be needed to boost productivity and introduce the new communications technology into the economic bases of Wales, Yorkshire, Humberside and the northeast. The report also shows that the government is going to have to swim against the economic tide which is washing so luxuriously around London's towers. But there are ways in which the government can channel investment: if it invests in skills and infrastructure even the most southern-oriented company directors can be persuaded to relocate or set up a new shop in the north. First, however, the government is going to have to concede the truth of the Kilfoyle critique. Labour's heartlands are suffering and only the most energetic revival of regional subsidy is going to help.",

      "body": "<p>Bernie Grant, the Guyanese Labour MP for Tottenham since 1987, who has died of a heart attack aged 56, was a red rag to the bulls of rightwing politics. A black man with a leftwing trade union background, he was also an anti-apartheid campaigner, a supporter of revolutionary governments, feminist causes, black studies and a multi-racial school curriculum.</p> <p>He became the figurehead and tireless activist in cases of official harassment or misconduct, notably the Joy Gardner case, where a black woman died after immigration officers entered her house and put her under restraint. And In 1985 when a riot exploded on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm estate and a policeman, Keith Blakelock, was murdered, Bernie commented that the youths on the estate felt that the police had received \"a bloody good hiding.\" The remark made him a notorious hate figure in the pages of the tabloids.</p> <p>Bernie Grant was born in 1944 in Georgetown, Guyana, His parents, Eric and Lily were schoolteachers, and he attended St Stanislaus College, a Jesuit-run secondary school. The family arrived in England in 1963, and he attended Tottenham technical college, before doing a degree course in mining engineering at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh.</p> <p>We met in 1970 while working for the Post Office at the International Telephone Exchange, in King's Cross. His radical engagement in student politics had already made him well known throughout the network of black students. It turned out that we'd both lived within a hundred yards of each other in Georgetown. He had a confident, humorous manner which made him instantly likable. We didn't discuss politics and spent most of our time larking around, practising our French and Spanish by trying to chat up the continental operators, or reminiscing about Guyana.</p> <p>He talked from time to time about going back to Heriot Watt or somewhere else and resuming his studies, but when the Post Office strike of that year began, and Bernie became one of the chief organisers in our branch, it was obvious that he was happy and excited by the challenge of trade union politics and organisation.</p> <p>Bernie stayed on as the exchange representative for the telephonists, attended union conferences, pursued a number of trade union courses, and wound up as chair of the branch.</p> <p>With a typical mixture of passionate commitment and shrewdness, Bernie had recognised one of the few industrial areas where the colour of his skin would not be a disability. At the beginning of the 70s, Powellism was still a force in workplace attitudes, but the Post Office was more or less a multiracial enclave where there were black supervisors and union officials. The Chapel Street branch in London was notorious as a hotspot of National Front activity, and Bernie was a prime mover in the campaign to outlaw racist practices in the workplace.</p> <p>During that period his politics took on a sharper edge, and he began to forge long-term alliances on the radical and anti-racist left.</p> <p>He then became a full-time official for the National Union of Public Employees. Haringey, where he had lived and been a student, was an almost inevitable port of call. The borough's growing ethnic population was confronted by hardline racist organisations. He became a local councillor and then leader of the council.</p> <p>His election coincided with a period of intense conflict between the Conservative government and a variety of municipal authorities. The tabloid press, dubbed him Barmy Bernie, and Haringey council was the subject of an endless stream of negative stories.</p> <p>His notoriety and support for controversial projects such as the campaign for black sections in the Labour party, made the Labour establishment nervous and distant, and his survival as a political figure was due mainly to the respect and affection that large segments of the local electorate felt for him. In 1987 he won the Tottenham Parliamentary seat, ousting Norman Atkinson, who had been the MP for 20 years.</p> <p>He entered Parliament dressed in African robes, and his career entered a new more internationally-oriented phase. His sympathies were pro-Arab and he made several visits to Colonel Gadafy in Libya. At the same time he became an important resource for developing world governments. When the volcano erupted in Monserrat a row broke out about British aid and policy towards the refugees. Typically the Monserratian chief minister immediately telephoned Bernie Grant and invited him to plead the island's case.</p> <p>Bernie caused some embarrassment by arriving on the island before the government's own fact-finding mission, but he was never reluctant to break ranks, frequently going against some of the most deeply held beliefs of his leftwing allies. For instance, he defended Harriet Harman's decision to send her children to a selective school, arguing that his own children had suffered from their education in the public sector. Before that he began the campaign for government reparations to the former colonies.</p> <p>Like his support for black sections in the Labour party, these were views often strongly opposed by political allies and enemies alike, but in recent years he had become a highly respected figure, and while he faced plenty of criticism, it was muted by the respect and affection in which he was generally held.</p> <p>However, during the last 10 years his chronic diabetes had begun to disable him, which in turn gave him relatively little time to attend the House of Commons.</p> <p>Even those who characterised him as rash and hasty acknowledged that he was likeable, charming, generous to friends and enemies, and relentlessly honest. Those closest to him understood that he had never accepted the dogmatic positions of faction and party. He had a passionate devotion to an ideal of justice, and he believed that politics was about these notions.</p> <p>He is survived by his three children from his first marriage and by his wife and devoted assistant, Sharon.</p> <p>\u0095 Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant, politician, born February 17, 1944; died April 8 2000</p>",

It turned out that we'd both lived within a hundred yards of each other in Georgetown. He had a confident, humorous manner which made him instantly likable. We didn't discuss politics and spent most of our time larking around, practising our French and Spanish by trying to chat up the continental operators, or reminiscing about Guyana. He talked from time to time about going back to Heriot Watt or somewhere else and resuming his studies, but when the Post Office strike of that year began, and Bernie became one of the chief organisers in our branch, it was obvious that he was happy and excited by the challenge of trade union politics and organisation. Bernie stayed on as the exchange representative for the telephonists, attended union conferences, pursued a number of trade union courses, and wound up as chair of the branch. With a typical mixture of passionate commitment and shrewdness, Bernie had recognised one of the few industrial areas where the colour of his skin would not be a disability. At the beginning of the 70s, Powellism was still a force in workplace attitudes, but the Post Office was more or less a multiracial enclave where there were black supervisors and union officials. The Chapel Street branch in London was notorious as a hotspot of National Front activity, and Bernie was a prime mover in the campaign to outlaw racist practices in the workplace. During that period his politics took on a sharper edge, and he began to forge long-term alliances on the radical and anti-racist left. He then became a full-time official for the National Union of Public Employees. Haringey, where he had lived and been a student, was an almost inevitable port of call. The borough's growing ethnic population was confronted by hardline racist organisations. He became a local councillor and then leader of the council. His election coincided with a period of intense conflict between the Conservative government and a variety of municipal authorities. The tabloid press, dubbed him Barmy Bernie, and Haringey council was the subject of an endless stream of negative stories. His notoriety and support for controversial projects such as the campaign for black sections in the Labour party, made the Labour establishment nervous and distant, and his survival as a political figure was due mainly to the respect and affection that large segments of the local electorate felt for him. In 1987 he won the Tottenham Parliamentary seat, ousting Norman Atkinson, who had been the MP for 20 years. He entered Parliament dressed in African robes, and his career entered a new more internationally-oriented phase. His sympathies were pro-Arab and he made several visits to Colonel Gadafy in Libya. At the same time he became an important resource for developing world governments. When the volcano erupted in Monserrat a row broke out about British aid and policy towards the refugees. Typically the Monserratian chief minister immediately telephoned Bernie Grant and invited him to plead the island's case. Bernie caused some embarrassment by arriving on the island before the government's own fact-finding mission, but he was never reluctant to break ranks, frequently going against some of the most deeply held beliefs of his leftwing allies. For instance, he defended Harriet Harman's decision to send her children to a selective school, arguing that his own children had suffered from their education in the public sector. Before that he began the campaign for government reparations to the former colonies. Like his support for black sections in the Labour party, these were views often strongly opposed by political allies and enemies alike, but in recent years he had become a highly respected figure, and while he faced plenty of criticism, it was muted by the respect and affection in which he was generally held. However, during the last 10 years his chronic diabetes had begun to disable him, which in turn gave him relatively little time to attend the House of Commons. Even those who characterised him as rash and hasty acknowledged that he was likeable, charming, generous to friends and enemies, and relentlessly honest. Those closest to him understood that he had never accepted the dogmatic positions of faction and party. He had a passionate devotion to an ideal of justice, and he believed that politics was about these notions. He is survived by his three children from his first marriage and by his wife and devoted assistant, Sharon. \u0095 Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant, politician, born February 17, 1944; died April 8 2000",

He ought to be telling them that a total of 0.33% of income tax, or a third of a penny in every pound collected from income tax, is spent by the British government on refugees. He ought to be telling his constituents that the reason new Labour cannot properly fund the NHS or education is because it will not increase taxation on the rich, and has nothing to do with refugees. He ought to be telling them that Britain takes fewer refugees per head of the population than Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Finland, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Irelland and Denmark. In 1997 Britain provided for just 0.05% of the total world refugee population of 13m. He ought to be telling his constituents that in 1999 the \"big four\" countries whose citizens sought refuge in Britain were Yugoslavia, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, all of them war, or civil war zones. He ought to be telling them that new Labour's asylum act will force refugees to live below the poverty line. And he ought to be arguing that refugees are not to blame for what is wrong in British society but rather that the problems lie with the very nature of the capitalist system we live under. As a socialist he ought to be doing all these things, but then that would put him in conflict with his position as a Labour MP.

He has responded by slashing the staff, buying time with two batting veterans, John Morris and Darren Bicknell, and relying upon the turbulent talent of the Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. He will expect better this time around.

Promotion is the main aim but will be difficult with the likes of Warwickshire and Notts around. Captain Adams had a shocking winter with England but county bowlers should feel the force of his frustrations. The bowling looks good if fitness is maintained. Bevan is back and will be a wow in one-days.

Alan Richardson's progress will be keenly monitored. Not one batsman averaged 40 in 1999, yet several could rectify that with application, not to mention fewer dastardly tracks. Woolmer's innovations - portable pitches, email communiques, groundsharing with Villa - will keep all on their toes.

Support, though, is slim ( Richard Illingworth eked out 15 wickets last term), the loss of Moody and Newport painful. Vice-captain Steve Rhodes will deputise capably for Hick, but if Vikram Solanki (above) is poised to bloom, that will be a mixed blessing for a club with such a skinny order.

Frank, a central defender, and Ronald, an attacking midfielder, remain unsettled in Catalonia. The Independent Gianluca Vialli was spotted in \"deep and meaningful conversation\" with Patrick Kluivert after Chelsea's Champions League clash with Barcelona. Kluivert last week restated his desire to play in England sooner rather than later. Teamtalk Liverpool have joined the hunt for Alvaro Recoba. Internazionale's sometime striker is set for talks with coach Marcello Lippi this week and Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus are all ready with bids should they fail. Planet football Athirson, full name Athirson Mazolli de Oliveira, is the latest young South American talent to be linked with a move to England. The Brazilian under-23 international currently plays for Flamengo, but Arsenal and Barcelona have both expressed an interest. Athirson would cost either club \u00a315m. Spanish international Ismael Urzaiz claims that Arsenal want to sign him this summer. The striker, who has only scored four times in La Liga this season, is still an even bet for a place in Spain's Euro 2000 squad.",

In response to the obvious question on share options he raises eyebrows. \"We haven\u00d5t even discussed that sort of thing yet,\" he comments, somewhat affronted. </p> <p> Disingenuous or not, Brewer clearly thinks that hackery and mammon make uneasy bedfellows. Does he think it will be difficult to hire people without the kind of options on offer that start-ups are waving around? \"We don\u00d5t want that sort of person,\" he replies. \"We want committed journalists who have a passion to deliver content as succinctly and accurately as possible.\"</p> <p> In Britain at least, CNN will face some tough competition to make itself the first port of call on the web. As well as the BBC, it faces beefed-up operations from the likes of Sky News which is adding 30 staff to its online service and ITN New Media which also announced plans for expansion last week. CNN\u00d5s not so secret weapon could be Time Warner\u00d5s proposed merger with America Online which can only underline its presence on the web.</p> <p>Part of the task is to change the perception that CNN is still US-centric. \"Anyone who still has the perception that we are just a US channel probably hasn\u00d5t watched us in a couple of years,\" says Lazar. \"It\u00d5s not the product people remember from the Gulf war, when we first really came onto the scene in Europe. \"Our TV started out as a US service, which then became international and is now regionalised.\" CNN was split in 1997 into four separately scheduled channels, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin and North America and the Middle East and Africa. In the US, CNN is available in more than 77m households while across Europe it is in 86m. Its first foreign language channel was CNN en Espanol, launched as a companion to CNN International Latin America. Richards says there are \"a couple\" of markets in the works for local TV stations, although a specifically tailored UK service is not one of them.</p> <p> \"We are not going to change perceptions overnight,\" says Lazar. \"But the internet especially is a global medium by its very nature and as we bring in more local people we will change that perception.

      "bodyText": "Our core business is fundamentally simple: we will give young people the ability to shop securely online without the need for a credit card. Acting as an online debit facility, money will be deposited into a teenagers' online account. This will then be used to fund purchases from a network of partner Internet retailers, the actual transaction being carried out in much the same way as existing payment methods such as credit or debit cards. The concept is simple to us, but we've been amazed at how many times we've been asked exactly what it is that we are doing. It isn't just elderly relatives who have never used a computer that are struggling to understand what we are up to. This question has been asked by people that you would expect to be a little more clued-up, including friends that use the Internet every day at work and, more surprisingly, professional services companies that are pitching for our, and no doubt other, dot.com business. OK, so we are exaggerating a little, but it does serve to illustrate a wider point. When we have introduced our business to people they have shown, either directly or indirectly, a lack of understanding about what we are doing. In a broader sense, many people are genuinely struggling to make sense of what is going on in the world of interactive media. Take some of the marketing agencies we have spoken to. Several have appeared bewildered by the demands from new dot.com businesses. Many have been unable to demonstrate a deep understanding of our needs and ambitions. This is despite the fact that the industry, particularly advertising, has had an integral role in launching numerous new online businesses. It has also been of the one of the ultimate beneficiaries of the venture capaital money pouring into the Internet space at the moment. We have also found that some agencies are understandably wary of the potential downside of working in a relatively volatile and immature market. With the spotlight focused firmly on dot.com businesses at the moment, professional services companies that have spent years building a great reputation within their industry risk destroying it in a very short space of time if something happens to go wrong. Morgan Stanley has been criticised in some quarters for its handling of the lastminute.com flotation, for example. The lack of understanding, both in the commercial and in the consumer worlds, stems from a number of factors; the speed of changes underway, the array of technical platforms available (Internet, WAP, digital TV) and the massive hype surrounding the industry. It can also be difficult for people to make sense of pure online businesses that have no physical presence. Working in a relatively insular world with high levels of usage and involvement with the Internet, it is important for us to be aware that some consumers are confused about what is going on. It is sobering to remember that for all the hype, the Internet has still not touched the lives of a significant proportion of the population.

In her best films, she was not only a woman who had kicked around the world, but who had been kicked around by the world. </p> <p>In John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), which raised the western genre to artistic status, she was \"saloon girl\" Dallas, who has been forced out of town by puritanical women. When the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) proposes to her, she says, \"But, you don't know me, you don't know who I am.\" \"I know all I want to know,\" he says. Seeing a glimmer of hope, she asks the drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), \"Is that wrong for a girl like me? If a man and woman love each other? It's all right, ain't it Doc?\" Typical as the role was, Stagecoach was one of the few films that sanctioned her happiness. </p> <p>She was born Claire Wemlinger in in New York of a French father and Northern Irish mother. When her father lost his clothing business during the Great Depression, she went out to work to help the family. Later she managed to attend Columbia University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, before starting her acting career in stock in the late 1920s. By 1932, she had starred on Broadway opposite Edward Arnold in The Party's Over, which brought her to the attention of 20th Century Fox, who gave her a five-year contract in 1933. </p> <p>At Fox, she played Shirley Temple's mother in Baby Takes A Bow (1934), supported Spencer Tracy in Dante's Inferno (1935), and made six films directed by veteran craftsman Allan Dwan, but they were mostly inconsequential programmers. She left Fox hoping for better roles and immediately landed one from Samuel Goldwyn in William Wyler's Dead End (1937) as hoodlum Humphrey Bogart's ex-girlfriend, reduced to streetwalking and ravaged by illness. Although she is barely on screen for five minutes, in a memorable seriers of close-ups, she made enough impact to be nominated for a supporting actress Oscar. \"I'm tired. I'm sick,\" she tells Bogart. \"Can you see it? Look at me good. You've been looking at me like I used to be.\" </p> <p>Dead End set her off on a series of roles as wanton women: gangsters' molls in thrillers and saloon bar gals in westerns. In The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse (1938), she played Bogart's moll who betrays him, and in I Stole a Million (1939), she helps her mobster husband George Raft. However, Trevor had to wait for the rise of 1940s film noir to become one of the leading women of the genre. With her long, blonde hair whisked up above the broad-shouldered gowns and a seen-it-all look in her eyes, she was able to hit her stride. </p> <p>In Street of Chance (1942), she misleads amnesiac Burgess Meredith by telling him he is wanted for murder, though she is the real killer. As the sexy, two-faced Mrs Grayle in Edward Dmytryk's Murder My Sweet (1944), she tells Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell), \"You shouldn't kiss a girl when you're wearing a gun. It leaves a bruise.\" In Born to Kill (1947), she is \"a silken savage,\" a mercenary divorcee with a fatal attraction for a man who has already killed two people. \"You're strength, excitement and depravity,\" she is told. Anthony Mann's Raw Deal (1948) was one of the rare noir movies in which the narration was supplied by a woman, in this case Trevor as the betrayed girlfriend of a racketeer. </p> <p>In the same year, in Key Largo, for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress, Trevor played Gaye Dawn, the fading alcoholic mistress of sadistic gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson). \"She's a lush,\" says Robinson's fat henchman (Thomas Gomez). \"After she bends the elbow a few times, she begins to see things - rats, roaches, bats, you know. A sock in the kisser is the only thing that will bring her out of it.\" Pathetically singing Moanin' Low to please Rocco, Trevor revealed the character's touching dependence on the brute. </p> <p>During the next decade, Trevor's image continued to be \"strength, excitement and depravity\", especially in two films of 1951: Best of the Badmen as Robert Preston's angry and disillusioned wife, and Hard, Fast and Beautiful as the greedy ambitious tennis mother determined to live off her daughter's earnings. In 1954, she gained another Oscar nomination for The High and the Mighty (1954), this time as a loose woman among imperilled airline passengers. Ironically, Charles, her only child by the second of her three marriages died in an air crash in 1978. </p> <p>In Vincente Minnelli's Two Weeks in Another Town (1962) as Edward G Robinson's \"worn out, dry, old hag\" of a wife, she rants and raves, drinks and smokes. \"Don't take an overdose,\" Robinson tells her. \"You know how ill it makes me.\" Like most of her later roles, such as the man-hating harridan in How To Murder Your Wife (1965), it was a reference to many of the parts she had played in her black-and-white movie past. </p> <p>She not only enjoyed a Hollywood career spanning five decades, but performed in hundreds of radio and television shows - including an Emmy-winning role in Dodsworth. She retired from acting in 1987 and became a patron of the arts. </p> <p>\u0095 Claire Trevor (n\u00e9e Claire Wemlinger), film actress, born March 8 1909; died April 8 2000</p>",

      "body": "<p>Cable giant NTL's recent attempts to woo the independent production sector with a \u00a325m spend on original content underlines the precarious position of the once dominant British broadcaster. New media is continuing to erode the viewer base and broadcasters are continuing to see the fragmentation of their audience, but is bad news for the broadcaster bad news for all? Not necessarily so. </p> <p>For too long the power of distribution has rested in the hands of too few, but now new technologies should free up the stranglehold that broadcasters have on the distribution of media, and open up the revenue potential that the right to broadcast carries with it. </p> <p>As a producer I am eager to have direct access to our audience and to be able to fund our own output. At Ideal World we see the web as a way of doing just that.

      "bodyText": "Cable giant NTL's recent attempts to woo the independent production sector with a \u00a325m spend on original content underlines the precarious position of the once dominant British broadcaster. New media is continuing to erode the viewer base and broadcasters are continuing to see the fragmentation of their audience, but is bad news for the broadcaster bad news for all? Not necessarily so. For too long the power of distribution has rested in the hands of too few, but now new technologies should free up the stranglehold that broadcasters have on the distribution of media, and open up the revenue potential that the right to broadcast carries with it.

Despite a lacing of fascinating Georgian and Victorian buildings, and brave attempts to make its canals into new urban arteries and its central squares hotbeds of new public art, Birmingham's architecture remains strangely unmemorable. The centre, the Bull Ring, was blitzed in the war and then rebuilt dismally, save for the Rotunda, and is being rebuilt again in a trashy, flashy way, as if the city were determined to be known for its philistinism. </p> <p>Help, however, is at hand from an unlikely source: Future Systems, the studio of radical architects fronted by Amanda Levete and Jan Kaplicky, who designed the gloriously original new press pavilion at Lord's cricket ground in London. </p> <p>Future Systems has been commissioned by Selfridges to design its new Birmingham store as part of the Bull Ring redevelopment. Work begins this autumn, and should be completed in 2002. What it will offer Birmingham, aside from sophisticated shopping, is what we have learned to call a \"landmark\" building, one that cannot be missed and helps define the image of a city centre. </p> <p>This martian spaceship-like building will be visible from the exit of Birmingham New Street, one of Britain's most wilfully banal railway stations. It is guaranteed to catch the eye of locals and visitors alike: a soft, organic form billowing seductively above the rooftops of existing shops and offices and acting as a foil to the spire of St Martin's church. </p> <p>Central Birmingham is being remodelled along two new principal streets - one of which will be covered and will form part of a massive new shopping mall. This will house the main entrance to the Selfridges store. Apart from this, the building will be accessible only by a pedestrian bridge designed by Future Systems, leading from a multi-storey car park. </p> <p>The blue store will thus help define the new-look Birmingham. It makes sense that this image will be dominated by modern buildings that are, effectively, air-conditioned covered markets, for the city has always been a great centre for getting and spending. It's a little sad, though, because while Birmingham is better known today for its conferences and summit meetings, its trade shows and its orchestra, it was also the working home of Boulton and Watt (and thus the steam engine); of Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen; and John Baskerville and his peerless typeface. Here, too, the X-ray was discovered, together with cotton wool and Cadbury's Creme Eggs. If New York is the Big Apple, Birmingham is the Mountainous Chocolate Egg. </p> <p>In designing Selfridges, however, Future Systems has reconciled commerce, art and science in a building that reflects many of this landlocked city's virtues and inventions. The design is a fairly simple five-floor building penetrated by two amoeba-shaped atria and topped with a curvaceous roof-top garden and an ultra-modern restaurant. What makes the building so distinctive is its skin, a kind of architectural chain-mail, which will flow sinuously around the building. This is to be made from thousands of ceramic or coloured-aluminium discs in many shades of blue. </p> <p>The new Selfridges will seem to be windowless, except for one large eye-window that peers out from behind the chain-mail and another that glides open and leads on to a balcony. If the building is all but hermetically sealed, this is because the area it is sited in is really no place to walk. The Bull Ring area is a kingdom for cars, with some of the fastest urban traffic in Europe. </p> <p>Selfridges' chain-mail, says Kaplicky, was inspired by the metal fabrics devised by fashion designer Paco Rabanne, who, incidentally, trained for 12 years as an architect. The clever thing about this second skin is that it allows a loose fit over the building. If an additional curve were required in the building's jellyfish-like profile, it would be easy to add some more discs curving up and over it. As a result, the building will appear to be softly structured, a design that should appeal across the board. It is so distinctive, however, that, in theory at least, Selfridges agrees with Levete and Kaplicky that the store will need no name. Everyone will know it is Selfridges as surely as shoppers do the great neo-classical store in London's Oxford Street. </p> <p>While the architects will be able to shape the main restaurant and cafes, what they cannot do is control the shops inside the new store. These will be given over to individual brands and outlets, each with its house style - from the preppy New England look of Ralph Lauren to the slick European modern of Giorgio Armani. </p> <p>The store will not have a conventional entrance. Instead of a wall of glass interrupted with a row of doors, customers will enter through nothing more than a screen of steel mesh, inspired again by the fabrics of Paco Rabanne. Security is hardly a problem inside these new malls: they seem to boast more CCTV cameras per square foot than the headquarters of the CIA. </p> <p>If we must have these giant shops, they should at least be interesting as works of architecture. Future Systems has pulled off the trick, doing for Birmingham what Sir John Burnet did 90 years ago for London's Oxford Street with his original Selfridges store - a wonderful steel-framed structure that remains the one great building in a mile-long corridor of commercial schlock. Can you name five others?</p>",

Here, too, the X-ray was discovered, together with cotton wool and Cadbury's Creme Eggs. If New York is the Big Apple, Birmingham is the Mountainous Chocolate Egg. In designing Selfridges, however, Future Systems has reconciled commerce, art and science in a building that reflects many of this landlocked city's virtues and inventions. The design is a fairly simple five-floor building penetrated by two amoeba-shaped atria and topped with a curvaceous roof-top garden and an ultra-modern restaurant. What makes the building so distinctive is its skin, a kind of architectural chain-mail, which will flow sinuously around the building. This is to be made from thousands of ceramic or coloured-aluminium discs in many shades of blue. The new Selfridges will seem to be windowless, except for one large eye-window that peers out from behind the chain-mail and another that glides open and leads on to a balcony. If the building is all but hermetically sealed, this is because the area it is sited in is really no place to walk. The Bull Ring area is a kingdom for cars, with some of the fastest urban traffic in Europe. Selfridges' chain-mail, says Kaplicky, was inspired by the metal fabrics devised by fashion designer Paco Rabanne, who, incidentally, trained for 12 years as an architect. The clever thing about this second skin is that it allows a loose fit over the building. If an additional curve were required in the building's jellyfish-like profile, it would be easy to add some more discs curving up and over it. As a result, the building will appear to be softly structured, a design that should appeal across the board. It is so distinctive, however, that, in theory at least, Selfridges agrees with Levete and Kaplicky that the store will need no name. Everyone will know it is Selfridges as surely as shoppers do the great neo-classical store in London's Oxford Street. While the architects will be able to shape the main restaurant and cafes, what they cannot do is control the shops inside the new store. These will be given over to individual brands and outlets, each with its house style - from the preppy New England look of Ralph Lauren to the slick European modern of Giorgio Armani. The store will not have a conventional entrance. Instead of a wall of glass interrupted with a row of doors, customers will enter through nothing more than a screen of steel mesh, inspired again by the fabrics of Paco Rabanne. Security is hardly a problem inside these new malls: they seem to boast more CCTV cameras per square foot than the headquarters of the CIA. If we must have these giant shops, they should at least be interesting as works of architecture. Future Systems has pulled off the trick, doing for Birmingham what Sir John Burnet did 90 years ago for London's Oxford Street with his original Selfridges store - a wonderful steel-framed structure that remains the one great building in a mile-long corridor of commercial schlock. Can you name five others?",

He is said to be reopening the investigation into the fire that burned down his offices in 1990. Ingram has offered to give evidence about the fire. He has also offered to give evidence to the Bloody Sunday inquiry if he is allowed to testify anonymously. He has said he has seen intelligence files which showed the IRA was ordered on that day not to open fire, contradicting claims by the army that it expected its soldiers to be attacked. The injunction, meanwhile, prevents newspapers from publishing any information he has about Bloody Sunday. richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com",

The EU is committed to carbon dioxide reductions of 8% by 2010 and they are expected to be reduced further after that date in order to combat the threat of global warming - but as nuclear power is phased out, this will become increasingly difficult. The report compiled by the London-based consultancy ERM Energy so alarmed the EC's energy and transport directorate at first that it was kept confidential but now officials have decided it should be released shortly to \"stimulate debate\" on the future of electricity generation in Europe. Although the report concludes it is \"highly unlikely\" that the public will accept new nuclear stations being built in Europe, it says that without them legally binding targets to reduce emissions will be very difficult to maintain. Electricity generation produces one third of all carbon emissions in Europe but nuclear power produces none. However, it is extremely expensive, according to the report, and has the side effect of producing nuclear waste and large quantities of plutonium which is a security threat. The alternative energy sources which produce no carbon dioxide - renewable sources like solar and wind power, biogas from landfills, and crops to burn in power stations - are being developed too slowly. In some countries, notably the UK, there is great potential for these alternatives but lack of political will to harness them means they are unlikely to fill the gap. The report says that despite increasing public and political opposition to nuclear power, particularly in Germany, it is important to keep them in production to meet the Kyoto target for the EU of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 8% by 2010. Most nuclear stations were designed for 25 to 30 years but the report says they should be retained for 40 years. Some in Britain have already been given licences to run for 45 years. Europe can meet its 8% reduction target on 1990 levels by 2010 by keeping existing nuclear stations open and continuing the switch from coal generation of electricity to gas.

Black honour would be restored, he opined. For too long Zimbabweans had been forced to do things the white man's way. But he insisted that a collar and tie was still obligatory for anyone wanting to watch. It wasn't so much a debate as a competition to see who could most fervently endorse President Robert Mugabe's proposal to amend the constitution so his government can seize white-owned farms and demand that Britain meet the cost of compensation to the flotsam of empire.</p> <p>The speeches by the \"honourable comrades\" were full of fury at the legacy of British rule. Cecil Rhodes came in for particular venom. The land grab by white settlers 110 years ago was the \"unfinished business\" in Zimbabwe, they said. Then the MPs burst into a revolutionary war song and ululated in front of the mace until Comrade Speaker beckoned for order. In many respects Zimbabwe's parliament has changed little from colonial days. It's MPs sit on the same Westminster-style benches that once housed Ian Smith and his illegal regime after its unilateral declaration of independence.</p> <p>Today the MPs are \"honourable comrades\" and their dealings with each other are a model of civility by the standards of Westminster. But then the government front bench stares straight into the faces of the government front bench. There are only three opposition MPs among the 150 members and they are consigned to the very back. If you want to hear criticism of the government, go to the Anglican cathedral next door. \"Prayer meetings\" include robust talk about Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>Parliament's civility extends to portraits of Britain's Queen hanging in the corridor. One was painted shortly after her coronation when Zimbabwe was the colony of Southern Rhodesia. The other is from the 60s when Mr Smith still insisted on his loyalty to the crown. Before Mr Mugabe elevated himself to president he was a prime minister and self-declared Marxist revolutionary who must have wandered past the paintings almost daily. But they remained securely on the wall.</p> <p>When it was suggested to Comrade Speaker, Cyril Ndebele, last week that perhaps the portraits of the Queen were outdated, and should come down, he was genuinely astonished. Nobody had ever said that before. He wouldn't hear of it. Perhaps the real surprise is that Margaret Thatcher wasn't similarly honoured. She is viewed with great favour by Zimbabwe's leaders. One MP called her a woman of honour whose promise to pay for land redistribution had been broken by that treacherous Tony Blair. He wondered how the British could have let such a fine woman slip through their fingers.</p> <p>When it came to the vote on confiscating white land, those who supported the bill were told to shuffle to the right side of the house. The left stood empty. Mr Mugabe needed 100 votes to amend the constitution and that's exactly what he got. Or did he? Furious counting by Zimbabwean and foreign reporters in the press gallery could manage to account for no more than 98 MPs. But no one could be sure of the accuracy of this informal count because voting in Zimbabwe's parliament is an artful affair in which names are ticked off a list while the members mill around making it very difficult to check.</p> <p>The Honourable Comrade Minister for Industry and Commerce, Nathan Shamuyarira, led the government's charge in the debate so he seemed a logical person to seek out of comment. He announced he had \"written for the Guardian when it was a good newspaper, when it told the truth about Zimbabwe\". The MPs celebrations over the land issue were tempered by the realisation that it also marks the end of another era. On Tuesday, parliament will be dissolved ahead of elections next month. The opposition are expected to do well. For the first time in years, the government front benchers will finally get to look their opponents in the face.</p>",

It wasn't so much a debate as a competition to see who could most fervently endorse President Robert Mugabe's proposal to amend the constitution so his government can seize white-owned farms and demand that Britain meet the cost of compensation to the flotsam of empire. The speeches by the \"honourable comrades\" were full of fury at the legacy of British rule. Cecil Rhodes came in for particular venom. The land grab by white settlers 110 years ago was the \"unfinished business\" in Zimbabwe, they said. Then the MPs burst into a revolutionary war song and ululated in front of the mace until Comrade Speaker beckoned for order. In many respects Zimbabwe's parliament has changed little from colonial days. It's MPs sit on the same Westminster-style benches that once housed Ian Smith and his illegal regime after its unilateral declaration of independence. Today the MPs are \"honourable comrades\" and their dealings with each other are a model of civility by the standards of Westminster. But then the government front bench stares straight into the faces of the government front bench. There are only three opposition MPs among the 150 members and they are consigned to the very back. If you want to hear criticism of the government, go to the Anglican cathedral next door. \"Prayer meetings\" include robust talk about Mr Mugabe. Parliament's civility extends to portraits of Britain's Queen hanging in the corridor. One was painted shortly after her coronation when Zimbabwe was the colony of Southern Rhodesia. The other is from the 60s when Mr Smith still insisted on his loyalty to the crown. Before Mr Mugabe elevated himself to president he was a prime minister and self-declared Marxist revolutionary who must have wandered past the paintings almost daily. But they remained securely on the wall. When it was suggested to Comrade Speaker, Cyril Ndebele, last week that perhaps the portraits of the Queen were outdated, and should come down, he was genuinely astonished. Nobody had ever said that before. He wouldn't hear of it. Perhaps the real surprise is that Margaret Thatcher wasn't similarly honoured. She is viewed with great favour by Zimbabwe's leaders. One MP called her a woman of honour whose promise to pay for land redistribution had been broken by that treacherous Tony Blair. He wondered how the British could have let such a fine woman slip through their fingers. When it came to the vote on confiscating white land, those who supported the bill were told to shuffle to the right side of the house. The left stood empty. Mr Mugabe needed 100 votes to amend the constitution and that's exactly what he got. Or did he? Furious counting by Zimbabwean and foreign reporters in the press gallery could manage to account for no more than 98 MPs. But no one could be sure of the accuracy of this informal count because voting in Zimbabwe's parliament is an artful affair in which names are ticked off a list while the members mill around making it very difficult to check. The Honourable Comrade Minister for Industry and Commerce, Nathan Shamuyarira, led the government's charge in the debate so he seemed a logical person to seek out of comment. He announced he had \"written for the Guardian when it was a good newspaper, when it told the truth about Zimbabwe\". The MPs celebrations over the land issue were tempered by the realisation that it also marks the end of another era. On Tuesday, parliament will be dissolved ahead of elections next month. The opposition are expected to do well. For the first time in years, the government front benchers will finally get to look their opponents in the face.",

      "body": "<p>If you go down to the MIP TV programme market at Cannes today, you could be in for a big surprise. The suits can usually be seen marching between meetings in a swirl of borrowed Gauloises chic, but this year you might find them thrashing around in the sand, shouting at the sea. They are the King Cannes-utes of television, fighting back the waves of internet invaders. </p> <p>The internet will have the same revolutionary impact on the TV industry as television had on cinema, both as a commercial space and a source of entertainment and information. It will help to get rid of wasteful, pointless television, but it will not replace it. This is a very exciting prospect for everyone who believes in the box as a positive cultural force. It is also a very worrying time for those who have cynically (and boringly) exploited the distribution monopoly of mainstream media. </p> <p>The main reason for this is advertising. Ever since TV became the public's favourite trivial pursuit, advertisers have been working on ways of creating space between the programmes - hence ad-friendly formats such as soap and sitcom, which soon replaced the broadcast of full-length plays in the 50s as the staple diet of commercial TV. </p> <p>The problem was, and is, that most adverts miss the mark. Not because there is anything wrong with them, but because of the wastage involved in conventional schedules and breaks. For every one person who wants to know about your product, there are thousands, if not millions, who would rather put the kettle on, or stare at the cat. Even though, in some cases, they may not own either. All this, on the internet at least, is set to change. </p> <p>The television ratings compiler, Barb, is a crumbling currency. The more fragmented the media world becomes, the more inappropriate and irrelevant a panel-based system appears to be. In the digital age, buying ratings with Barb is a bit like purchasing a car with a bag of sweets, time-consuming and a bit creepy. </p> <p>Advanced picture compression and streaming technology on the internet, precipitated by an ongoing battle for supremacy between Microsoft Media Player, Apple Quicktime and Real Player, has opened up a global portal for the broadcasting of quality sound and pictures. It has created an alternative world of distribution and consumption, in which viewers choose content in their own time and place - at home, work or on their mobile phone. </p> <p>The commercial potential of streaming technology is enormous. After establishing a relationship with a viewer (using old-fashioned entertainment and inspiration), the internet broadcaster can stream relevant adverts into the programme content when viewers give them permission to do so.

      "bodyText": "If you go down to the MIP TV programme market at Cannes today, you could be in for a big surprise. The suits can usually be seen marching between meetings in a swirl of borrowed Gauloises chic, but this year you might find them thrashing around in the sand, shouting at the sea. They are the King Cannes-utes of television, fighting back the waves of internet invaders. The internet will have the same revolutionary impact on the TV industry as television had on cinema, both as a commercial space and a source of entertainment and information. It will help to get rid of wasteful, pointless television, but it will not replace it. This is a very exciting prospect for everyone who believes in the box as a positive cultural force. It is also a very worrying time for those who have cynically (and boringly) exploited the distribution monopoly of mainstream media. The main reason for this is advertising. Ever since TV became the public's favourite trivial pursuit, advertisers have been working on ways of creating space between the programmes - hence ad-friendly formats such as soap and sitcom, which soon replaced the broadcast of full-length plays in the 50s as the staple diet of commercial TV. The problem was, and is, that most adverts miss the mark. Not because there is anything wrong with them, but because of the wastage involved in conventional schedules and breaks. For every one person who wants to know about your product, there are thousands, if not millions, who would rather put the kettle on, or stare at the cat. Even though, in some cases, they may not own either. All this, on the internet at least, is set to change. The television ratings compiler, Barb, is a crumbling currency. The more fragmented the media world becomes, the more inappropriate and irrelevant a panel-based system appears to be. In the digital age, buying ratings with Barb is a bit like purchasing a car with a bag of sweets, time-consuming and a bit creepy. Advanced picture compression and streaming technology on the internet, precipitated by an ongoing battle for supremacy between Microsoft Media Player, Apple Quicktime and Real Player, has opened up a global portal for the broadcasting of quality sound and pictures. It has created an alternative world of distribution and consumption, in which viewers choose content in their own time and place - at home, work or on their mobile phone. The commercial potential of streaming technology is enormous. After establishing a relationship with a viewer (using old-fashioned entertainment and inspiration), the internet broadcaster can stream relevant adverts into the programme content when viewers give them permission to do so. Meanwhile, the web server picks up who is watching and for how long they are on line. This information is then added to a vast database and processed for individual programme reports. For the first time, ratings will be accurate; advertisers will get exactly what they pay for and viewers will have a say in what, when and how they view programming - for free. Independent producers should therefore think carefully about selling exclusive internet rights to their programmes before studying all the options available to them. They may want to develop broadcast distribution channels of their own, either exclusively or in partnership with internet platforms. Cable, satellite and digital terrestrial TV channels are all excellent means of delivering millions of hours of enhanced content to the world, especially for \"event\" programming. However, access to the delivery \"pipes\" is limited to a few owners and distribution is either expensive (multi-channel TV is still a luxury) or restricted to a few free terrestrial channels. The beauty and strength of the internet is that nobody and everybody owns it. If you are an independent producer with quality content, the cost of encoding and distributing your content for distribution on the internet is exactly the same as it would be for a major Hollywood studio. So why bother getting lost in a library where you can't make any noise? My company, ichooseTV.com, is in Cannes with a warning to producers and content-owners not to limit the distribution opportunities of their programmes. Beware the exclusive licence deal unless it offers unlimited access to people who want to view your work in a controlled, accountable environment. With personalised schedules, \"smartcasting\" and streamed commercials via the internet, cost-effective programme distribution for everyone is possible at last. So there is no need to fight them on the beaches - the ISPs and TV portals are allies of old media. Streamed sound and picture quality is improving every day and with it our chances of working together to change the future of television. Just don't wait and see - or someone else will do it first. \u0095 Richard Kilgarriff is CEO at ichooseTV.com, which unveils its plans for a free personalised internet television service at MIP TV this week",

Before superstitials, advertisers used banner ads, with outdoor billboard-like visuals. Advertisers want more intrusive formats, but the websites can't degrade the user experience by anything that will, for example, slow down the load time. Superstitial solves that problem by loading ads when you have already loaded a page and are reading it. The modem is idle, so we don't slow down page loads. When you click from one page to another, that's the trigger for the ad to play. Because it's all loaded in your machine, it doesn't take ages to load like a web page. So while banners play as part of the page, a superstitial plays between pages. </p> <p> <strong> What's the thinking behind it?</strong> </p> <p> The internet gets a large audience, but in terms of creative flexibility it doesn't score highly. Banner ads are a limited message, and the consumer is doing other things while reading. Because we came out of the advertising world as opposed to the technology world, we refused to believe that banners were the endgame, and believed we could develop technology that provides advertisers with the kind of experience they want, without interrupting the experience users want. </p> <p> <strong> What are the advantages? </strong> The main benefit is in creative flexibility. It is another dimension, a medium more like TV. Secondly, there is a standard definition of an impression. There are no standard formats for banners, so an advertiser buying 10 websites will have to do four or five versions of an ad. We standardise all that. The average banner ad click-through is 0.3%; on a superstitial it's about 7.5%, and some will get 40%. The advertising is more prominent, because you can close the ad once it starts playing, but you can't stop it playing. The ads are more interesting, too. It's a comment on how effective advertisers can be on the internet. </p> <p> <strong> Any disadvantages? </strong> It doesn't yet play on Macs, but will do within 30 days. As bandwidth increases and websites sell more advertising, and as agencies plan how to make ads more effective on the net, the ads will get better, but we don't see that there are a lot of drawbacks to the technology.

It would leave the industry rudderless at a time when it needs a coherence and leadership which has been lacking since privatisation. Sir Alastair, who was brought in by Mr Prescott after advising the government on the Channel Tunnel rail link rescue bid, wants to negotiate at least two key franchises before the election and unveil a new strategy for the industry this summer. While pleased at Mr Prescott's offer, Sir Alastair wants to ensure that it is not scuppered by the Treasury, as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is forced to draw up his priorities for the election, of which health will be at the top of the list. At the moment the Government is subsidising rail to the tune of \u00a31.3bn this year, a figure which will reduce to \u00a3900m by 2002, and is then due to disappear altogether. A senior industry source said: \"Mr Prescott is very anxious to demonstrate that the railways have improved under his leadership. He would be delighted, and so would the SRA, if the authority could come up with an eyecatching project or two. But this is not an industry which can perform like that. It takes a long time to turn things around.\" Train operating companies have been warning the government that unless their subsidies continue, they will not be interested in renewing their franchises.",

Until her rise, the prime minister in a novel or screenplay would be some generalised grey-hair, played by a character actor in late middle-age. But during the decade of Thatcherism, a male prime minister made the story seem dated or futuristic. And a female one would be identified directly as Thatcher, edging the fiction towards libel or satire. </p> <p>In the 80s, James Bond found himself under the political control of the Thatcher-impersonator Janet Brown. Michael Dobbs, in his House Of Cards trilogy, deliberately set the stories far ahead, when Thatcher had handed over to a ruthless man, an instinct which turned out to be wrong politically but right dramatically. Sometimes a politician so changes the perception of the role that a fictional stand-in seems a pale impersonation. </p> <p>Two American presidents have stalked the imagination in this way. After Nixon, viewers and readers wondered whether each fictional White House occupant had a dirty tricks team in the back room. Post-Clinton, any invented president who likes sex or lying is taken as a contemporary commentary, while any White House paragon on page or screen is assumed to be a corrective fantasy. American TV responded to Nixon with Behind Closed Doors - Watergate with the names changed. Its Clintonian equivalent has - perhaps fittingly - a more complicated relationship with the truth. </p> <p>The West Wing (tonight, 9pm, Sky1) follows the story of President Josiah Bartlett, Democrat president of vast charm and dangerous evasions. In some ways it is a roman \u00e0 clef, but one in which, in the manner of computer encryption programmes, the key has received maximum scrambling. </p> <p>Clinton has already inspired more fictional impersonations than any sitting president. Michael Douglas in The American President played Clinton as the White House seducer he might legitimately have been if Hillary had conveniently died young. Gene Hackman in Clint Eastwood's Absolute Power dramatised the long-rumoured Clinton dark side - Arkansas gossip about rape, murder and drug-running - which moved from innuendo to constitutional crisis during the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>In The West Wing, Martin Sheen as President Bartlett is visually a post-Clinton dreamed-up leader (grey-haired, red-faced, sexually energetic), with useful hints of a past commander-in-chief. Sheen played JFK in the mini-series Kennedy and seems to use some of those famous Bostonian inflections here. </p> <p>Writer Aaron Sorkin also seems to have drawn on those two stories. Bartlett is distanced from recent presidential history by having a loving, apparently faithful relationship with his wife, although she maintains a separate career as a doctor - a fantasy about the tolerance of the American electorate which would probably irritate Hillary Clinton more than anything else in this drama. </p> <p>But Bartlett does possess a politically lethal secret. He ran for election while hiding a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This works as a metaphor for Clinton's duplicity - avoiding the viewer asking \"which one is Monica?\" - yet also draws on the way Jack Kennedy hid a degenerative kidney condition which might in time have done the work of Oswald's bullet. </p> <p>If identification is one problem in political fiction, the other is ideology. The reason that audiences are much higher for dramas than for news shows is that the majority of the population is bored by the theories and techniques of politics, though occasionally turned on by its personalities. </p> <p>The West Wing addresses this focus-group resistance by placing in the foreground the urgent and gossipy surface of politics. The President collapses with a fever (a hint of his hidden medical condition) on the eve of the State Of The Union address, while a Washington website has just reported that the White House chief of staff is a recovering alcoholic and drug-abuser. These crises are interspersed with comedy from the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns of the administration - bitchy and ambitious aides who aspire to running the country but can't organise their own love lives. </p> <p>If it merely consisted of these scenes, The West Wing would still be re-elected unopposed most Monday nights by those with Sky. It would, though, be Reaganite drama: all jokes and smiles and no hard choices. What's so impressive about The West Wing is that it's genuinely informative about politics - although a few of its policies prevent it from being entirely a dream ticket. Even Sheen can't manage to save the obligatory scene in which he quotes from the Constitution with soaring strings behind. </p> <p>It would be good one day to have a Clinton-Lewinsky Behind Closed Doors, but, until then, The West Wing is smart, tough stuff. With the exception of the 1970s Trevor Griffiths series Bill Brand, about a Labour MP, British TV drama has usually treated politics as comedy (Yes, Minister, House Of Cards) or fantasy (A Very British Coup.) Americans are more solemn about politics, but The West Wing achieves the difficult feat of dramatising the nuts and bolts of office while also showing you the screws.</p>",

Sheen played JFK in the mini-series Kennedy and seems to use some of those famous Bostonian inflections here. Writer Aaron Sorkin also seems to have drawn on those two stories. Bartlett is distanced from recent presidential history by having a loving, apparently faithful relationship with his wife, although she maintains a separate career as a doctor - a fantasy about the tolerance of the American electorate which would probably irritate Hillary Clinton more than anything else in this drama. But Bartlett does possess a politically lethal secret. He ran for election while hiding a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This works as a metaphor for Clinton's duplicity - avoiding the viewer asking \"which one is Monica?\" - yet also draws on the way Jack Kennedy hid a degenerative kidney condition which might in time have done the work of Oswald's bullet. If identification is one problem in political fiction, the other is ideology. The reason that audiences are much higher for dramas than for news shows is that the majority of the population is bored by the theories and techniques of politics, though occasionally turned on by its personalities. The West Wing addresses this focus-group resistance by placing in the foreground the urgent and gossipy surface of politics. The President collapses with a fever (a hint of his hidden medical condition) on the eve of the State Of The Union address, while a Washington website has just reported that the White House chief of staff is a recovering alcoholic and drug-abuser. These crises are interspersed with comedy from the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns of the administration - bitchy and ambitious aides who aspire to running the country but can't organise their own love lives. If it merely consisted of these scenes, The West Wing would still be re-elected unopposed most Monday nights by those with Sky. It would, though, be Reaganite drama: all jokes and smiles and no hard choices. What's so impressive about The West Wing is that it's genuinely informative about politics - although a few of its policies prevent it from being entirely a dream ticket. Even Sheen can't manage to save the obligatory scene in which he quotes from the Constitution with soaring strings behind. It would be good one day to have a Clinton-Lewinsky Behind Closed Doors, but, until then, The West Wing is smart, tough stuff. With the exception of the 1970s Trevor Griffiths series Bill Brand, about a Labour MP, British TV drama has usually treated politics as comedy (Yes, Minister, House Of Cards) or fantasy (A Very British Coup.) Americans are more solemn about politics, but The West Wing achieves the difficult feat of dramatising the nuts and bolts of office while also showing you the screws.",

They are the ultimate in food control, removing choice. What once was fed to pigs is now given to a sub-class of consumers. This is not the Third Way but neo-mediaevalism. Prof Tim Lang Thames Valley University \u0095 The cost of wasted food is already included in the prices charged by supermarkets. Why should they have tax rebates so they can make higher profits?

She appears first in \"civvies\" - smart browns and beiges, carefully applied make-up and well-groomed, burnished-copper hair.

She looks like she's dressed by Principles, maybe a bit more expensive - then changes into her gown and tufty, talcum-powdered wig ready for court.</p> <p>Criminal law continues to be her greatest passion and despite her myriad commitments, she still manages three-quarters of a full-time practice. We manage to squeeze our interview between family life (she has three children aged 16, 13 and 10); court work; writing and broadcasting; a trip to Ireland to pick up an honorary degree (Gregory Peck will also receive one) and a visit this week to Ukraine on behalf of the British Council.</p> <p>There is something typically lawyerly about the way she articulates - for the most part she is measured, careful, deliberate - but her observations are peppered with excitingly angry, unlawyerly adjectives. She is \"appalled\", \"shocked\", \"horrified\", \"disgusted\"; she finds things \"scandalous\" and \"outrageous\". She feels a \"swell of anger\" at injustices, she listens to her \"inner voice\" and it matters to her that she listens to her conscience and can face herself in the mirror. All very un-Blairite - especially when much of her criticism is targeted at government itself.</p> <p>In the past, Kennedy has described her relationship with the government she worked so hard and long to get elected as one of a \"critical friend\"; she has come in for a certain amount of flak from her own side for speaking out, but she has picked her arguments carefully and they concern the issues about which she knows and cares most - human rights and civil liberties</p> <p>\"For anybody who has been involved politically, there's always a pull between one's loyalty to one's own party in government and one's conscience - particularly where there's such hostility in the press and where you know that you'll be jumped upon and used as a stick with which to beat the government,\" she says.</p> <p>\"There is a real temptation to disagree but not be vocal.

It's \"invidious\", she says, that citizens will lose their fundamental right to choose a jury trial for middle-ranking offences and it will be left to magistrates - largely white, middle-class and legally unqualified - to choose who goes to crown court and who doesn't.</p> <p>But her harshest words are reserved for suggestion that lawyers like herself were driven by self-interest and were only opposed to the changes because it might reduce their workload in the crown court. \"The idea that that should be pushed out to the press and public as being the reason why lawyers might stand up and say 'hold on a minute' was disgusting.

George Tenet, the CIA director, acted against the seven employees last week after two internal agency reviews on the bombing, on May 7, which killed three Chinese citizens and injured more than 20 others. The attack plunged US-China relations into deep freeze and renewed doubts about the Nato campaign in several European nations. Mr Tenet's decision, which was announced in an unusual public statement from the agency, follows 11 months of public and private Chinese government pressure for \"severe punishment\" of those responsible for the bombing. The action has immediately sparked allegations in the US that President Bill Clinton's administration has used the agents as scapegoats in an effort to smooth relations between Beijing and Washington after Chinese officials refused to let the matter die. The agents against whom action has been taken have not been identified. However, reports in the US yesterday said that the sacked agent was a mid-level career officer whose targeting error was blamed for the incident. The others, said to include one senior official and four supervisors, received punishments varying from spoken admonitions to suspended promotions and pay awards. The US has already apologised to Beijing and agreed to pay $28m (\u00a317.5m) in compensation to the Chinese government, as well as $4.5m (\u00a32.8m) to families of those who were killed and injured. The CIA confirmed yesterday that its internal inquiries had concluded that the intelligence officers had intended to target the Yugoslav military supply headquarters, but wrongly identified the building housing the embassy. \"The evidence shows that this was clearly a tragic accident,\" spokesman Bill Harlow said in a statement. Although Chinese - and, from time to time, some western sources - have claimed that the American attack was a deliberate act, the official Washington version of events which emerged within days of the attack has not substantially changed in the ensuing months. The CIA says the bombing was caused when the now sacked officer mistakenly identified the military supply HQ on a street map on the basis of its address, 2 Bulevar Umetnosti, which was in fact several hundred yards away from the building housing the Chinese embassy. The map on which the target was identified was a 1997 map that showed the Chinese embassy located at its earlier address in the centre of Belgrade. After the location was wrongly fixed, it was discussed during three meetings among CIA officials, none of whom questioned the targeting procedure that had been used. The target details were then passed to the Pentagon and Nato, but were not queried there either. The whole saga is particularly embarrassing for the CIA because this was the only one of 900 targets struck by Nato planes during the 78-day campaign that was wholly selected by the agency. \"The CIA lacked formal procedures for preparing and forwarding target nomination packages to the US military,\" Mr Harlow admitted. However, as reported in the Guardian last year, in the week preceding the embassy bombing another mid-level CIA officer did voice doubts and objections to the identification of the target. This agent called colleagues at the US military mapping agency in Washington with his doubts and also discussed the matter with the Nato taskforce in Naples, Italy, which was responsible for issuing instructions to B-2 stealth bomber crews about their night missions. No senior official intervened, however, and the strike went ahead. The officer who raised the concerns was officially praised - though not identified - by Mr Tenet in his official statement. A lawyer for one of the reprimanded officers said yesterday that it was \"manifestly unjust\" to blame individual CIA officers when \"the failure was systematic\".

Washington objects to the sale to China of a sophisticated airborne radar system which Pentagon officials say is similar to America's own airborne warning and control system (Awacs). Israel claims that the system does not contain American technology. The sale of the Phalcon radar system is the latest in a series of alleged transfers of military technology which have angered Washington. The confrontation comes into sharp focus this week. Tomorrow, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the US president, Bill Clinton, will meet in Washington. US officials say their talks will almost certainly include US concerns that the system would give China a dangerous new advantage in a potential confrontation with Taiwan. Two days later, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, will arrive in Israel to inspect the first Russian-made plane to be fitted with the sophisticated Israeli avionics.

Sonny Callahan, the chairman of the house of representatives appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said he was issuing the threat to reinforce a similar warning from the US defence secretary, William Cohen. During a visit to Israel last week, Mr Cohen argued that the sale would alter the strategic balance in the Taiwanese straits by beefing up Beijing's capability to intercept and shoot down Taiwanese and US aircraft. Mr Barak promised to review the matter. \"We are aware of the sensitivity in the United States with regard to China,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>About 280 years ago, Lord Hervey had trouble with his mother. He called her Mount Vesuvius, because \"from her mouth poured fire and rubbish\". I must say I sympathise. My mother erupted last week. For some odd reason she has turned against Rosemary. At the sound of the R-word, out pours a molten flow of bitterness-speak. It is difficult, under these conditions, to invite Rosemary round for tea, so I have taken to visiting her in her small apartment.</p> <p>\"Where are you going?\" roars my Mother. \"Out!\" I am 15 again. I cannot say R... and risk another tremor.</p> <p>But on Saturday Rosemary braved it, visiting for the first time since her traumatic departure from our road. Down in the kitchen we were out of the glare of my mother's fury. But Rosemary is not one to cower or suck-up. She, too, likes to express her opinions in a loud, clear voice. And both she and my mother are highly skilled grudge-bearers. The air prickled with hatred.</p> <p>Rosemary and I battled on with our coffee break. No sound came from my mother's room. Did she know I had a visitor or was Rosemary's voice drowned out by the sound of the Walton's on telly? I do hope so. Rosemary is not the only one.

      "bodyText": "About 280 years ago, Lord Hervey had trouble with his mother. He called her Mount Vesuvius, because \"from her mouth poured fire and rubbish\". I must say I sympathise. My mother erupted last week. For some odd reason she has turned against Rosemary. At the sound of the R-word, out pours a molten flow of bitterness-speak. It is difficult, under these conditions, to invite Rosemary round for tea, so I have taken to visiting her in her small apartment. \"Where are you going?\" roars my Mother. \"Out!\" I am 15 again. I cannot say R... and risk another tremor. But on Saturday Rosemary braved it, visiting for the first time since her traumatic departure from our road. Down in the kitchen we were out of the glare of my mother's fury. But Rosemary is not one to cower or suck-up. She, too, likes to express her opinions in a loud, clear voice. And both she and my mother are highly skilled grudge-bearers. The air prickled with hatred. Rosemary and I battled on with our coffee break. No sound came from my mother's room. Did she know I had a visitor or was Rosemary's voice drowned out by the sound of the Walton's on telly? I do hope so. Rosemary is not the only one. Over the years many of them have blotted their copy somehow. Some ate too much dinner, some didn't wash up, some answered back, some wore horrid clothes, some were rowdy and worst of all, some had taken advantage. Only a very few have spotless records. But as I like to assert that I am a grown-up, I press on, entertaining chums regardless, although the mood in our house is not always as mellow as I would like. I party on a knife edge.

A study of children who developed the brain condition after an apparently healthy infancy found that 24 out of 25 had the measles virus in their gut. Researchers said the virus could have come from the combined mumps, measles and rubella vaccine, given to hundreds of thousands of children in Britain every year. John O'Leary, of the Coombe women's hospital in Dublin, and Andrew Wakefield, of London's Royal Free hospital, presented their research to the United States Congress last Thursday and said there was \"compelling evidence\" linking autism with MMR. But the department of health rejected the study and said parents should continue to trust the vaccine. \"This is a highly selective sample carried out with incorrect and inappropriate controls and unverifiable by usual scientific means,\" a department spokeswoman said. \"As such it is uninterpretable. It does not prove anything and there remains no evidence to suggest there is any link between the MMR jab and autism. \"It would be a disaster if children were to die of vaccine-preventable diseases [because of] unfounded vaccine safety scares.\" The research is the latest scare over the MMR vaccine, which has been linked to a number of health problems, although other studies have given it the all-clear.",

While Mrs Whiting, 49, was on the line to emergency operators, Carter shot her again before shooting himself through the head.</p> <p>A transcript of the 999 call shows Mrs Whiting saying 30 times that her husband was dead and pleading for help.</p> <p>An ambulance reached the scene within seven minutes of her call, but police stayed outside the house fearing that the gunman could be alive and open fire on them and paramedics if they entered.</p> <p>The family of Mrs Whiting, who was shot in both ankles and in one thigh, say if police had entered sooner she would have survived.</p> <p>Lawyers for Mrs Whiting's daughter, Catherine Elvin, 29, said yesterday they would sue Kent police for negligence. They claim Mrs Whiting would have had a 98% chance of survival if officers had entered the house sooner, and that a senior officer ignored her rapidly deteriorating condition.</p> <p>Mrs Whiting called 999 at 12.26am on March 10 1995.</p> <p>She told the operator: \"I'm dying, I'm shot.\" She was reassured that help was on the way and a tape of the call records her being shot again. Her husband, who had tricked his way into the house, can then be heard saying, \"Kid, I'm going to kill myself,\" before committing suicide.</p> <p>By 12.38am she told a police operator who stayed on the line with her that Carter was dead. The operator repeatedly offered comfort and reassured her help was on the way as she lay with her husband's corpse by her side, with police and paramedics outside the house.</p> <p>Mrs Whiting's last words were. \"No one's coming, are they. No one's coming. Please come in.\"</p> <p>Mrs Whiting's family have been further angered by Kent police's refusal to hand over documents relating to the incident and a tape of the 999 call.</p> <p>In a letter the force's solicitor wrote: \"The reason this will not be released is that it is an extremely traumatic item to listen to. This then has the potential to cause grave unease, possibly trauma to others for whom the chief constable has responsibility, and even to members of the public, should its contents be published.\"</p> <p>Mark Pugash, spokesman for Kent police, yesterday condemned those who criticised the actions of the police officers.</p> <p>He said: \"The only legitimate position to look at this from is that you're outside the house, knowing what the officers knew, and ask yourself hand on heart would you have done anything differently?</p> <p>\"There was no way of determining if the situation Loraine Whiting described is accurate or because someone had put a gun to her head.\"</p> <p>An investigation by the police complaints authority cleared officers of wrongdoing.</p> <p><b>Desperate plea for help that never came</b></p> <p>The call from Loraine Whiting is logged at 00.26 on March 10 1995. It lasts 61 minutes and nine seconds:</p> <p><b> Elapsed time: 00.01</b></p> <p>BT operator: Which service?</p> <p>Whiting: Ruins Barn Road, number 48.

      "bodyText": "The family of a woman who bled to death after the police allegedly stopped paramedics reaching her for nearly an hour are to sue officers for negligence. Loraine Whiting made a 999 call after being shot by her estranged husband Leonard Carter in Sittingbourne, Kent. While Mrs Whiting, 49, was on the line to emergency operators, Carter shot her again before shooting himself through the head. A transcript of the 999 call shows Mrs Whiting saying 30 times that her husband was dead and pleading for help. An ambulance reached the scene within seven minutes of her call, but police stayed outside the house fearing that the gunman could be alive and open fire on them and paramedics if they entered. The family of Mrs Whiting, who was shot in both ankles and in one thigh, say if police had entered sooner she would have survived. Lawyers for Mrs Whiting's daughter, Catherine Elvin, 29, said yesterday they would sue Kent police for negligence. They claim Mrs Whiting would have had a 98% chance of survival if officers had entered the house sooner, and that a senior officer ignored her rapidly deteriorating condition. Mrs Whiting called 999 at 12.26am on March 10 1995. She told the operator: \"I'm dying, I'm shot.\" She was reassured that help was on the way and a tape of the call records her being shot again. Her husband, who had tricked his way into the house, can then be heard saying, \"Kid, I'm going to kill myself,\" before committing suicide. By 12.38am she told a police operator who stayed on the line with her that Carter was dead. The operator repeatedly offered comfort and reassured her help was on the way as she lay with her husband's corpse by her side, with police and paramedics outside the house. Mrs Whiting's last words were. \"No one's coming, are they. No one's coming. Please come in.\" Mrs Whiting's family have been further angered by Kent police's refusal to hand over documents relating to the incident and a tape of the 999 call. In a letter the force's solicitor wrote: \"The reason this will not be released is that it is an extremely traumatic item to listen to. This then has the potential to cause grave unease, possibly trauma to others for whom the chief constable has responsibility, and even to members of the public, should its contents be published.\" Mark Pugash, spokesman for Kent police, yesterday condemned those who criticised the actions of the police officers. He said: \"The only legitimate position to look at this from is that you're outside the house, knowing what the officers knew, and ask yourself hand on heart would you have done anything differently? \"There was no way of determining if the situation Loraine Whiting described is accurate or because someone had put a gun to her head.\" An investigation by the police complaints authority cleared officers of wrongdoing. Desperate plea for help that never came The call from Loraine Whiting is logged at 00.26 on March 10 1995. It lasts 61 minutes and nine seconds: Elapsed time: 00.01 BT operator: Which service? Whiting: Ruins Barn Road, number 48. I've been shot. Operator: You've been shot? Whiting: I'm dying - I'm shot. 00.14 Call passed to ambulance operator Anneka West. Whiting names husband Len Carter as gunman. West calls Loraine \"Lynn\". 00.58 West: Are you all right? 01.04 Whiting: Yeah. He's somewhere in the house. 01.07 West: We've got some one on the way to you - we've got the police on the way too. 01.16 Background noises, then a male voice. 01.18 West: Has it come out or is it still in your leg? 01.19 Whiting (whispering): I can't talk, I can't talk. 01.38 Sounds of footsteps then heavy breathing. 01.51 A bang is heard, possibly from a shotgun. Another is heard a minute later. 01.56 Screaming heard. 02.01 Another bang is heard. 02.21 West: I can hear her breathing. 02.41 Carter: ... Kid... I'm going to kill myself. 03.31 Another bang is heard 12.42 Whiting: I've been shot. He's shot himself. 12.51 West: He's shot himself. You think he's dead?

      "bodyText": "Charles Wardle, the former Home Office minister who has accepted a \u00a3120,000 directorship from Mohamed Al Fayed, is to stand down from parliament, blaming a \"deeply unpleasant faction\" which has taken over the party under William Hague's leadership. In a letter to his Bexhill and Battle Conservative association, Mr Wardle expressed deep regret over his decision, which had not been forced on him by local activists opposed to his decision to join the Harrods board. \"There are better things to do with my life than to scrap with the shrill, deeply unpleasant faction inside and outside Westminster who are in danger of dislocating the party from the wider electorate,\" Mr Wardle said in his letter announcing that he would not contest the next election despite being renominated in January. \"I have always loved working in the constituency but life has become very drab in the House of Commons and this awful Labour government treats parliament with contempt. In contrast to this, the business challenge at Harrods is interesting and stimulating.\" Mr Wardle made the decision to stand down after Mr Fayed told him that he could increase his workload at Harrods if he abandoned the \"low life and half men in Westminster\". The former minister, who turned down Mr Fayed's application for British citizenship in 1993, also threatened to sue the Daily Telegraph after it lampooned his decision to accept a \u00a3120,000 non-executive Harrods directorship. Mr Wardle believes he was libelled on Wednesday when the newspaper printed a cartoon of him diving into a giant brown Harrods envelope stuffed with \u00a350 notes. Mr Fayed is understood to have assured Mr Wardle that he will underwrite his legal expenses if the case goes to court. Mr Wardle's appointment to the Harrods board, which was cleared with the Tory whips and with the parliamentary standards commissioner, horrified many Tories. Mr Wardle, who disclosed his new two days a week appointment in last Tuesday's Guardian, insisted that Mr Fayed's business interests were all above board.",

More depressingly, he showed that we're all complicit in the charade of believing we can do... something. A year on, the food had gone, the bedding was sold. The children were still rocking quietly to themselves in corners. Before the men left, a Moldovian woman asked: what about my children?

Epicurus boiled it down to three points: (1) friends; (2) an analysed life; (3) self-sufficiency. To illustrate the inverse correlation between money and happiness, De Botton adopted the style of Vision On's mad professor, standing in a field with a graph. \"Imagine this side are levels of happiness, and this side, levels of money.

      "trailText": "<p>Gary Mitchell is that rare thing in Northern Ireland: a loyalist playwright. He talks to  Fiachra Gibbons about the struggle, and his latest work</p>",
      "byline": "Fiachra Gibbons",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Gary Mitchell can handle the knocks on his door from men with notches on their guns wanting a \"quiet word\" about his plays. The threats in the street from the less subtle local heavies is also something \"you have to expect\". </p> <p>What keeps Mitchell awake at night is not the fear of losing a kneecap, but of some sniper in the dark saying he's written a bad play. \"It's reviews that scare me,\" he says. \"Someone leaving the theatre saying it's not very good, that I haven't been completely truthful.\" </p> <p>Mitchell is a rare beast. He is a playwright from Rathcoole, a sprawling loyalist estate in north Belfast. What is more, he chose to stay put and live among the eejit hoods, unhappy wives and thwarted idealists he writes about. Not for him comfortable anonymity in a middle-class suburb. Not an inch. </p> <p>His family didn't know what to make of him. \"Protestants don't write plays, you see. You must be a Catholic or a Catholic sympathiser, or a homosexual to do that. No one in our community does that because playwriting is a silly pretend thing.\" </p> <p>Into this culture of silence and distrust, Mitchell has been lobbing grenade after grenade for 10 years, and with each one his aim has become more sure. In a Little World of Our Own was a raw howl of righteous anger at the \"hard men\" who warp the values of everyone around them. \"People just sat there afterwards in silence, not leaving the theatre,\" Mitchell recalls. One after-show discussion lasted longer than the play itself. Trust went further, setting loyalties to lovers, tribe and children against one another. Two years ago came As the Beast Sleeps, with paramilitaries turning on each other in the phoney peace of ceasefire - an augury of the internecine warfare now being waged between the UVF and LVF. </p> <p>Lately, as Mitchell's work has popped up on TV and radio, threats have given way to honking horns and shouts of \"Keep the faith, Gary!\" One night 90 of Rathcoole's finest trooped into Belfast to see In a Little World of Our Own. \"It was great,\" says Mitchell. \"Not having been to a play before, they did all the wrong things - they talked, they rustled their sweets, and they drank. The theatre had to get five extra bar staff in to cope. For the first time they understood what I was at.\" </p> <p>That goodwill will be tested by his new play, The Force of Change. For Mitchell is tackling the greatest taboo - collusion between the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries. Even the good cops in the play are finally corrupted by their own prejudice and their instinct to cover up. \"If they look into their hearts, no one can deny the truth of my play,\" insists Mitchell. </p> <p>Still, this is not what the Unionist people want to hear right now. Collusion is the stick with which nationalists have beaten the police for years, alleging they worked hand in glove with the UVF and the UFF, supplying them with intelligence on republican suspects. For Mitchell to question the RUC at a time when Unionists are fighting plans to change its name and structure will be seen as playing into the enemy's hands. What makes this perceived treachery worse is that Mitchell is a loyalist from a hardline area who flirted with the paramilitaries. He should know the score. </p> <p>\"I grew up completely loyalist, completely Unionist, completely Protestant,\" says Mitchell. \"I believed it all. I was very frightened of this Catholic monster that was raping my community and trying to kill us all. I tried to involve myself in the UDA and find out where the UVF was. I tried to play my part, I wanted to bring the war to them. I did some bad stuff to some people to prove myself but I was racked with guilt. My conscience would never let me go to the levels of criminality you needed to. People put it down to a lack of masculinity. I was full of weakness but those weaknesses I now see as my strengths. I have an inability to break the law. I tried but my conscience kept calling me back, and I question everything.\" </p> <p>The Protestant work ethic was the first shibboleth he found wanting. Mitchell, 34, left school at 16 and was unemployed for eight years. What happens to the work ethic when there's no work? \"I couldn't get respect, I couldn't get anything that offered me dignity. Without a job in Rathcoole you can't get a girlfriend unless you got involved [in paramilitary politics].\" </p> <p>The truth matters a lot to Gary Mitchell. No one has entirely good motives in his plays. Caroline, the lone woman detective in The Force of Change, should be the heroine as a working mother, but she's too busy using her colleagues' sexism and sectarianism to lever herself up the greasy pole. Truth, Mitchell says, was the first victim of the Troubles. \"When things are so obviously fucked up, no one wants to listen to the guy pointing to the sties in everyone's eyes. Everyone wants to keep a lid on things - naturally, they've got to live. But if you're a playwright, that's your job.\" </p> <p>With true dissenter steeliness, Mitchell argues you cannot be a true loyalist unless you are \"loyal to the truth. I have not let the side down by writing this play. If anybody has let the side down, it is the RUC and those criminal elements within paramilitaries.\" After Drumcree, when the RUC \"stood against its own people\" to defend the nationalists of the Garvaghy Road, \"it lost the faith of the people. In loyalist eyes, they were supposed to be our defenders.\" </p> <p>Still, Mitchell says he has sympathy for grassroots RUC officers. We are asking a lot of them. Not so long ago they thought nationalists were out to kill them; now they are supposed to look after them as if nothing ever happened.\" </p> <p>Reforming the police is only the beginning, he says. The whole Unionist identity has to be recast. \"There is a fundamental crisis in Protestant culture. We have been going through an extremely depressing loss of identity, loss of culture, and worst of all, loss of a future. The past has been hijacked by the other side. They seem to have this huge mythic past, while the Protestant community has this little crappy one. We're hugely divided. Umpteen churches, umpteen political parties. When you have an enemy who is succeeding on every level, you need a new strategy. While we've been saying 'Not an inch' we have been losing miles. </p> <p>\"We need a new beginning, a reinvention. We have got to recognise our Irishness without giving up our Britishness. The problem of Northern Ireland over the past 30 years has been that the worst of Britishness has clashed with the worst kind of Irishness. No one in Scotland wants to be British, no one in Wales wants to be British any more, and the English never thought of themselves as British in the first place. So you have got us, who are not even in Britain, saying the most important thing to us is to be British. Us and bloody Al Fayed, of course.\" </p> <p>Knowing that the southern Irish want their nationalist cousins about as much as the British want the Unionists, Mitchell sees hope only in an independent Ulster where \"we will have to get on\". </p> <p>His thinking may be visionary, but Mitchell doesn't look like a prophet about to lead his people to the promised land. He wears a baggy, battered brown leather jacket of a type once briefly fashionable about 15 years ago. There's a softness about him too, a kind of squashed look of someone who has spent his life pushing against an immovable object. His background is straight-down-the-line decent, God-fearing, working-class Prod. His father, Chuck Mitchell, was a country and western singer and semi-professional footballer. Gary, however, is no athlete; as he cheerily admits, his brother, an Elim Pentecostalist preacher, got the lion's share of the handsome showbiz genes. </p> <p>He started writing after finally getting a job as a civil servant filing compensation claims from the victims of violence. \"Bomb damage stuff, personal injury, the usual was mind-bending dull. It nearly broke me. The only good thing was it got me meeting Catholics. One day I decided I was either going to have to shoot myself in the head or do something. I started to improvise life. Which is what plays are, I suppose - improvised life.\" </p> <p>That is what Northern Ireland has to do now, he argues. Be creative, take risks. \"Often you wonder if anyone is listening. The isolation can be terrible. There are so few people writing from the loyalist, Protestant perspective. There is no space for dissenting voices in Northern Ireland. You're with us or you're not.\" It's the loneliness of the long-distance visionary. But Mitchell has more company than he thinks.</p>",

His thinking may be visionary, but Mitchell doesn't look like a prophet about to lead his people to the promised land. He wears a baggy, battered brown leather jacket of a type once briefly fashionable about 15 years ago. There's a softness about him too, a kind of squashed look of someone who has spent his life pushing against an immovable object. His background is straight-down-the-line decent, God-fearing, working-class Prod. His father, Chuck Mitchell, was a country and western singer and semi-professional footballer. Gary, however, is no athlete; as he cheerily admits, his brother, an Elim Pentecostalist preacher, got the lion's share of the handsome showbiz genes. He started writing after finally getting a job as a civil servant filing compensation claims from the victims of violence. \"Bomb damage stuff, personal injury, the usual was mind-bending dull. It nearly broke me. The only good thing was it got me meeting Catholics. One day I decided I was either going to have to shoot myself in the head or do something. I started to improvise life. Which is what plays are, I suppose - improvised life.\" That is what Northern Ireland has to do now, he argues. Be creative, take risks. \"Often you wonder if anyone is listening. The isolation can be terrible. There are so few people writing from the loyalist, Protestant perspective. There is no space for dissenting voices in Northern Ireland. You're with us or you're not.\" It's the loneliness of the long-distance visionary. But Mitchell has more company than he thinks.",

      "bodyText": "Greece was gripped by political drama last night as exit polls put the socialist and conservative main contenders almost equal in the country's general election. \"We look set for an all-night derby, a thriller in all senses of the word,\" political analyst Giorgos Sefertdzis told Greek television. Analysts said that whoever won would do so only by a hair's breadth. A victory for the conservative New Democracy would end eight years of socialist rule under the prime minister, Costas Simitis, who had called the election five months ahead of schedule while riding a wave of popularity. Successive polls had shown his party, Pasok, which was created out of an anti-junta movement, leading by 2.5% and Mr Simitis enjoying a 10-point lead in popularity ratings over his conservative rival, Costas Karamanlis. From initial exit polls, Mr Sefertdzis said the biggest winner appeared to be bi-polar politics, with the two main parties gaining substantial support at the expense of Greece's three small leftwing parties. The prospect of victory for the conservatives, out of office for 16 of the past 19 years, prompted thousands of jubilant, flag-waving supporters to gather outside the party's Athens headquarters. But Mr Karamanlis, who has been credited with imbuing the New Democracy party with renewed self-confidence, refrained from making any statement. Analysts said such a close race indicated that the prime minister, who has won praise for his fiscal reforms, had fallen victim to the painful measures that have been the backbone of his own success. Complacency and allegations of arrogance have marred the socialist campaign. Leading Pasok officials said last night it was \"unbelievable\" that a party with such widespread support for its economic and foreign policies could have been overtaken by New Democracy. \"It was a botched campaign, one that did not reach out to the youth and did not indicate renewal, which is what our policies have been all about,\" said one. \"Whether we win or lose there will be lots of recriminations.\"",

      "body": "<p>As the second world war was drawing to a close in 1944, two great works of political economy were published. One was Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, the driving force behind the free-market revolution in the final quarter of the 20th century. The other was Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation. </p> <p>Hayek's book is much the better known. It is the blockbuster to Polanyi's cult classic, up in the great canon with the Wealth of Nations, Capital, and the General Theory. Its pro-market, anti-state message has embedded itself deep into western societies, so that parties of the left now believe in low taxation, privatisation and rolling back welfare. </p> <p>Polanyi's book, though, is well worth reading. A Christian socialist refugee from fascism, Polanyi's explanation for the political and economic crisis in the West during the 30s was completely different from Hayek's. His argument in The Great Transformation was that the profit-maximising dictates of the self-regulating market were incompatible with social protection, which aimed at \"conservation of man and nature as well as productive capacity.\" </p> <p>Just as Hayek believed the growth of the state was the road to serfdom, Polanyi believed that the triumph of the self-regulating market was the road to social disintegration. He liked all the things Hayek loathed: social protection, trade unions, welfare states, curbs on finance. What makes this more than simply a disagreement between dead Austrians is that as the management of economic life is becoming more Hayekian, we are all becoming more Polanyian. </p> <p>Take the case of Barclays bank, for example. Hayek would have wholeheartedly supported the decision to close 171 branches, arguing that the greater good is served by the maximisation of profit. Moreover, he would have said that its chief executive's remuneration should be a matter for market forces, pure and simple. </p> <p><strong> Socially corrosive</strong></p> <p>Yet out in the real world, this sticks in the craw. Like Polanyi, most of us believe there is something socially corrosive about an economic system in which a highly-profitable bank considers it acceptable to close branches and charge customers for removing their own money from cashpoint machines while its chief executive stands to make up to \u00a330m . </p> <p>Banks enjoy enormous legal privileges - limited liability, the right to create credit, the right to charge compound interest - and society has a right to expect them to give something back in return. In America, there is a Community Regeneration Act, a relic from a different age, to make sure that they do. There is nothing - apart from timidity - to prevent our government doing the same here. </p> <p>Another example. Last week, it was revealed that Britain's climate may grow colder in future years because global warming will divert the Gulf Stream away from the UK. Hayek would say that we have pollution because no one owns the atmosphere, and that the solution is to create a system of property rights whereby polluters are sent a bill by the owners of the air for any damage they cause. Polanyi's solution would be to set up a world environment organisation with the right to impose sanctions on countries that refuse to cut emissions. </p> <p>There is little doubt about who has had the better of this argument in recent years. The 80s were supposed to have been suffused by boardroom greed, yet public disquiet made Burton Group think again about the \u00a36m package offered to Ralph Halpern. Today it is taken for granted that any new chief executive should be able to double his money through bonus payments, provided the company is not actually in the hands of the receiver. </p> <p>We have a World Trade Organisation with teeth because that suits those who believe in self-regulating markets. The idea that the US auto industry or the oil giants would allow Washington to sign up for a world environment organisation is for the birds. </p> <p>It is possible Hayek will be proved right.

      "bodyText": "As the second world war was drawing to a close in 1944, two great works of political economy were published. One was Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, the driving force behind the free-market revolution in the final quarter of the 20th century. The other was Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation. Hayek's book is much the better known. It is the blockbuster to Polanyi's cult classic, up in the great canon with the Wealth of Nations, Capital, and the General Theory. Its pro-market, anti-state message has embedded itself deep into western societies, so that parties of the left now believe in low taxation, privatisation and rolling back welfare. Polanyi's book, though, is well worth reading. A Christian socialist refugee from fascism, Polanyi's explanation for the political and economic crisis in the West during the 30s was completely different from Hayek's. His argument in The Great Transformation was that the profit-maximising dictates of the self-regulating market were incompatible with social protection, which aimed at \"conservation of man and nature as well as productive capacity.\" Just as Hayek believed the growth of the state was the road to serfdom, Polanyi believed that the triumph of the self-regulating market was the road to social disintegration. He liked all the things Hayek loathed: social protection, trade unions, welfare states, curbs on finance. What makes this more than simply a disagreement between dead Austrians is that as the management of economic life is becoming more Hayekian, we are all becoming more Polanyian. Take the case of Barclays bank, for example. Hayek would have wholeheartedly supported the decision to close 171 branches, arguing that the greater good is served by the maximisation of profit. Moreover, he would have said that its chief executive's remuneration should be a matter for market forces, pure and simple. Socially corrosive Yet out in the real world, this sticks in the craw. Like Polanyi, most of us believe there is something socially corrosive about an economic system in which a highly-profitable bank considers it acceptable to close branches and charge customers for removing their own money from cashpoint machines while its chief executive stands to make up to \u00a330m . Banks enjoy enormous legal privileges - limited liability, the right to create credit, the right to charge compound interest - and society has a right to expect them to give something back in return. In America, there is a Community Regeneration Act, a relic from a different age, to make sure that they do. There is nothing - apart from timidity - to prevent our government doing the same here. Another example. Last week, it was revealed that Britain's climate may grow colder in future years because global warming will divert the Gulf Stream away from the UK. Hayek would say that we have pollution because no one owns the atmosphere, and that the solution is to create a system of property rights whereby polluters are sent a bill by the owners of the air for any damage they cause. Polanyi's solution would be to set up a world environment organisation with the right to impose sanctions on countries that refuse to cut emissions. There is little doubt about who has had the better of this argument in recent years. The 80s were supposed to have been suffused by boardroom greed, yet public disquiet made Burton Group think again about the \u00a36m package offered to Ralph Halpern. Today it is taken for granted that any new chief executive should be able to double his money through bonus payments, provided the company is not actually in the hands of the receiver. We have a World Trade Organisation with teeth because that suits those who believe in self-regulating markets. The idea that the US auto industry or the oil giants would allow Washington to sign up for a world environment organisation is for the birds. It is possible Hayek will be proved right. It may be that self-regulating markets will maximise efficiency and, in the end, make us all happier and better off, although none of the relevant economic and social indicators - for growth, productivity, suicide, depression, violent crime - suggest that they have so far. If he were alive today, Hayek would say that this is because too much of the social democratic superstructure erected 50 years ago still survives and that it is stifling progress. In the end, the market may produce more and produce it more efficiently than any other economic system. But at what cost?

      "byline": "Gordon Burn",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Four years ago, for his last major show, at the Gagosian Gallery in New York, Damien Hirst made a piece featuring a giant beach ball bobbling on a column of air. The ball was multi-coloured and the box around the air supply was also brightly painted and carnivalesque. It was a sculpture that suggested playfulness and buoyancy and barmy insouciance and all the things that people already associated with Damien Hirst. He was the recognised ringleader and alpha talent of the most startling artistic development in Britain in what we must now call the last century. </p> <p>Loving in a World of Desire was a refinement of A Celebration At Least, one of Hirst's most innocent and affecting apprentice pieces, in which party balloons, some of them partly deflated, float in front of a bright, striped party backdrop. It is a sculpture out of a time and about a time when all of it was easy and like a party. You had an idea and you grabbed it and - hey! - next day you were in the papers. </p> <p>Now he has produced an uncomfortable new piece which relates to these earlier works the way the fresh-faced young friend from one's youth relates to the stranger with the frail, wintering, chemotherapy look, passed unexpectedly in the street. All the colour has been leached out, and the easy optimism of the 1995 work has been replaced by what seems to be an overt acknowledgement of ominousness and even dread. </p> <p>The beach ball in The History of Pain is white - ectoplasmically white and precarious; the top of the box above which the ball is suspended is pierced by several dozen rasped and hungry Sabatier knives. The briefest choking of the air supply and the ball will be punctured and instantly shredded. The fragility of existence has been Hirst's big theme from the beginning. The action of the world on things. It's why he puts things behind glass, and in formaldehyde in big steel and glass cases: to hold off the inevitable decay and corruption; as part of a futile effort to preserve them. </p> <p>A friend misheard The History of Pain as The History of Fame and went on referring to it by this title. Which gave Hirst the idea of tweaking the original sculpture into a second version. The cloned work will be identical in every detail: same bubble-like inflated ball, same fierce long knives. The only difference is that The History of Fame will have an audience track - rumbles of anticipation when the ball drops close to the knives and appears to be in danger of bursting; groans of disappointment when it floats clear of the daggers and the carvers. </p> <p>The period of neglect for an avant-garde artist has shrunk for each successive generation of artists in the past 100 years. It is no longer possible - or it seems no longer possible - for an important avant-garde artist to go unrecognised. And artists are no fun once they have been discovered. </p> <p>Having soared so high, so fast, and having struggled with what he calls \"a difficulty with art\" for the past four years, Hirst knows he has arrived at a crucial point in his life and his career. He says that if his adventures in the catering trade and his other excursions have taught him anything, it is that if he's not an artist, he's nothing. But he believes he has been hearing the grinding of knives for some time now. \"The art world's very shallow,\" he says. \"The art world lets you down. It's very shallow and very small and it's very easy to get to the top of it. And then you burst through the top of it and you've got no idea where the fuck to go. You know, they've all been waiting for me to die. Now they're all phoning up. I've got so many people on my back trying to get me to make things, pushing in the wrong direction. It's a constant effort telling people to just go away. I mean, everyone's your friend.\" </p> <p>It can be deduced from the Sabatier sculptures, and from a number of the other sculptures that he has made for a major show in New York in autumn, that Hirst's first work of the new millennium has taken a turn towards the nakedly autobiographical. Care will be taken wherever The History of Pain and The History of Fame go on show to make sure that nobody can put a foot on the pipe delivering the air supply. </p> <p> He was drinking a Steelworks. This was a new one. Just soda plus a dash of Angostura bitters and a twist of lime. Non-alcoholic. But fashionable, because Damien Hirst was drinking it. Soon a woman at the next table was ordering a Steelworks, and then a woman at Princess Diana's old table behind the column, away from the window. </p> <p>It was Steelworks all through lunch. Then a hot-towel shave and a haircut. And then Coca-Colas all the way through dinner. Even at the after-hours club around the corner, he stayed stubbornly - and (because he isn't Damien Hirst for nothing) lairily, not quietly - on the wagon. </p> <p>The next morning he was bright and early and in boisterous high spirits, which an unscheduled taxi ride between Reading and his new studio in Gloucestershire - \"You're going to love my new studio\" - could do nothing to dent. For two hours, we got the story of the Ebola virus, complete with detailed descriptions of the vomito negro (\"Black vomit,\" Damien explained helpfully, \"it contains the lining of your lungs as well as blood\") and typical Hirst-like actings-out and grotesque embellishments. He'd read The Hot Zone through all of one night, pacing the bedroom of his house in Devon, heart pounding, his eyes on stalks, horrified and yet electrified by the horror. </p> <p>He's always working on sculptures. Even at his drunkest you can sense him thinking; always looking, looking, looking. It troubles him; he sometimes wishes he could stop looking. He's on the lookout constantly for something that can be used. </p> <p>In addition to a change of clothes, his luggage consisted of a copy of the Fortean Times, a copy of Viz and a heavy leather-bound academic volume on blood. The single word \"Blood\" filled the whole of the spine. Blood is the symbol linking most of the new work he has been making. Blood and smoking. Blood and smoking and violent death. Sometimes, such as in a piece called An Unreasonable Fear of Death and Dying, the blood is graphic, splattered all over the rugs and furniture and glass of the vitrines. In An Unreasonable Fear, a chainsaw saws an armchair in half and sharks play on a tape loop on the television; a can of Charm air-freshener (\"Nature's Way\") stands on the blood-spattered cistern, behind the door with the word \"Die\" finger-painted in blood. </p> <p>In other instances, the blood is merely implied. Adam and Eve (Banished from the Garden) features two corpses on mortuary trolleys, buckets, bones; an unfinished cheese sandwich rests on one of the corpses. Figures in a Landscape is a vitrine divided into nine cells. Each cell contains bulging black binbags deodorised with sachets of Haze concentrated fragrance gel and \"Superfresh Neutradol\". \"Stop me B4 I kill again,\" reads the message written in lipstick on an old wardrobe mirror. </p> <p>We arrived at his studio at a time when Damien is often just falling into bed. And immediately, as if to announce his arrival, the peace of the countryside was shattered by the sound of security alarms going. The alarms started going and then phones started ringing to say the alarms had been triggered. He couldn't find the phones. He couldn't find the switches for the lights. The codes for the digital pads to stop the alarms bleating were written on another piece of paper. </p> <p>There is a new piece called Looking Forward to the Total and Absolute Suppression of Pain, in which four TV monitors simultaneously and at ear-splitting volume play four different commercials for Nurofen, Solpadeine and other headache tablets. The first 10 minutes at Stroud was like being in an opened-out version of it. </p> <p>There was an element of theatre involved, of course. Hirst is a showman artist in the tradition of the Victorian decadents like Johns and Sargent. The 20,000 sq ft of studio in a Cotswold village is his recently acquired Xanadu; a bolthole to withdraw to and \"sit the fuck down and concentrate on working\". \"I love the fact that there's no windows,\" he said. \"It's completely separated and isolated from anywhere else. It's a personal space. It's out of London.\" </p> <p>It is a vast building. In addition to his own work, it houses work by Warhol and Peter Halley, and by Goldsmiths contemporaries like Angus Fairhurst, Sarah Lucas, Rachel Howard and Jane Simpson. There's a conference room and a dining room, a gallery and a kitchen with a walk-in freezer. \"I blame Charles Saatchi,\" Damien said. \"'Cause when I was an art student, I went down to look at his space and I just wanted one. Immediately. I mean, art looks great in there. Art looks great in here. So you make art for it.\" </p> <p>Inside, when the lights did finally come on, the immediate impression was of menace. It felt a dangerous place. In addition to the Sabatier knives jutting skywards, the whole studio had been turned into a labyrinth of steely, reflecting surfaces and lacerating, industrially-cut edges. There were (real) skeletons and blood; (prosthetic) human body parts arranged on shelves and bagged in binliners; surgical instruments and corpses. And towering above it all, the sculpture that Hirst refers to as \"the big guy\" - a 20ft, 10-ton bronze cast of an anatomical children's toy that Charles Saatchi was four days away from buying for \u00a31m to add to his collection. The whole of it the fruits of two years' labour and a million-plus dollars. </p> <p>Over the past 50 years the vocabulary of art has expanded towards the inclusion of everything. Everything seen in a certain way becomes art, is art. Children's plastic toys and cheap domestic detritus are scattered through Hirst's new work. It was seeing his son Connor, who's five, playing with the figure from Humbrol's Young Scientist series that made him decide to cast it in bronze. \"I might even get sued for it. I expect it. Because I copied it so directly. It's fantastic. I just thought it was so brilliant, and it was so accurate, it was like a chemistry set, and I loved it that it was a toy. I wouldn't have done it with a teaching hospital one. This is much happier, friendlier, and more colourful and bright. Like plastic! The paint on it's like skin. It'll decay. I liked it for that reason. Eventually what you'll be left with is the paint hanging off and this big, fucking grand iconic sculpture.\" </p> <p>At home in Devon he has a fish tank with fish in it swimming around in rubbish. One fish is from the village pet shop, the other's from the fair, and they share their tank with a pair of false teeth, a model shark, and an old beer bottle. \"It's like the bottom of a beck [a stream]. All trash in it.\" </p> <p>In his studio near Stroud he had two fish tanks, each room-size and each with a gynaecologist's examination couch in it, which must rank among the best - certainly among the most mysterious - things he has made. Lost Love and Love Lost are two complete gynaecologist's offices underwater. In one, hundreds of jewel-like African river fish swim around the forceps and past the coat-stand and through the stirrups of the couch. The fish in the other are big, black carp that have already started to impose themselves on their surroundings. In time, everything - the adjustable stool, the white examination coat, the advanced technology - will be coated with green algae. </p> <p>These are clearly works that cry out for prolonged critical analysis and deep psychoanalytical investigation. They are haunting (consciously so) and beautiful. Their creator, of course, refuses these kinds of \"higher\" interpretation. \"They're pretty direct,\" he says. \"There's something really simple. If you've got a gynaecologist's office underwater with fish swimming about, then there's something fishy going on. An' fishy fannies come straight after that. I think. In the logic of it. I quite like the idea that the doctor's had to take his watch and his rings off [they are part of the furniture of Love Lost], so that you get the doctor's personality into the hand that's going to finger about with you down there. The woman's got her shoes on the floor, and there's the coat and the handbag. So there's a hugely sexual element to it. An' women smell of kippers.\" </p> <p>\"I find myself becoming more and more yobbish,\" Damien Hirst once said, \"when I expected to become more intellectual.\" This has partly been a defence mechanism. His lack of house-training, a talent relatively recently acquired, has kept him out of polite society and therefore away from contaminating conventional ways of viewing the world. He has always used drugs and drink as a way of isolating himself from banal experience and to bring him to something original or extraordinary in the moment that nobody else can see. </p> <p>He has always drunk and drugged. But he has also always been a ham. \"It's about expectation,\" he says. \"It's theatre. It's about raising expectations and lowering expectations. I've always done that. Regularly, when I used to go to openings, I used to go in looking like a tramp. Then I'd go in in a suit, then I'd go in like a tramp... So people would just be going, Damien's losing it, oh wow, he's really on top of it, omigod, he's losing it, no he's on top of it... And they never know where the fuck they are. </p> <p>\"The way I got involved with the art world... You get people to think one thing, and then you come round from another direction. I mean, you do it in an art work. I think that's what all artists do. They draw you into some sort of belief system and then - bang! - they hit you with something else. The one-two. Bacon does it. With a kind of bareness of paint, or a sensuality... Michelangelo does it. Everybody does it.\" </p> <p>Damien has always been able to charm his way out of things that would get other men done over or put away. The hooligan genius of recent Soho legend seemed, through his innate taste and acute intelligence, to be incapable of putting a foot wrong. Sometime during the making of this current work, though, a subtle shift occurred. He was banned from the Groucho Club after complaints from members. He dropped his trousers in the bar of his hotel in Dublin last month, where he was directing a Beckett play for television, and a female guest is persisting with her threat to sue after he inserted a chicken bone in the end of his penis. More recently, Norman Rosenthal, the exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, arrived at the Colony Room in Soho and found Damien trouserless at the piano. </p> <p>\"So what's new! Will you tell me when I haven't done that?\" he says. And then: \"I think I've spread myself so thin. I was just drinking too much to be concentrating hard. So something's got to give. Blackouts. I used to never get blackouts. I get blackouts now. I got involved in drink and drugs, didn't I? Mixed. So it's a completely different thing. I mean, I always mix my drinks. I don't stick to one drink. And then I started taking cocaine and drink. And I think there's some point when you do that where it becomes a different drug in its own right. When you add two chemicals together, you get a different chemical. There's a balance I was after between a certain amount of this and a certain amount of that. Like a fucking alchemist. </p> <p>\"But then overnight I turned into a babbling wreck. It was completely overnight. I've spoken to Maia [his partner] about it. It happened like that... I started to blow gaskets and pop rivets. I mean, it's been incredibly hard work not doing anything for four years, in terms of the art world. And I haven't done anything for four years because until now I've not felt it was any good. There's a kind of hunger. Well, you just have to starve people. You have to convince yourself that the art world's not going to go away if you go away.\" </p> <p>Since his last major gallery show, he has concentrated his energies in the commercial arena. He went into partnership with Marco Pierre White at Quo Vadis in 1996; then he opened Pharmacy, a restaurant, with Matthew Freud and others at the beginning of 1998. He believes now that maybe the restaurants were more effort than he admitted. \"It just wasn't art at the end of the day. You end up getting involved in fucking aprons, knives and forks, pots and pans, all the shit of life that you don't really want to get involved in. Stocks and shares, ties, boots, Blu-Tack, glue, string... </p> <p>\"Doing Pharmacy made me realise why you're not allowed to touch art - why it says, 'Do not touch' in art galleries. You go in after a week and it's fucked, you know what I mean? It's like all the things that can go wrong in your house if you get shit builders in, combined with letting a herd of elephants rampage through the art gallery.\" </p> <p>Damien Hirst joke. Q: \"What's the biggest thing you've ever killed?\" A: \"My career.\" </p> <p>He says this is the clue to the lipsticked inscription \"Stop me B4 I kill again\" in the brilliant binbag sculpture. \"I thought it was quite funny to have that, as a kind of cry to the public... It comes from The Shining, where he writes 'Redrum' on the mirror. And in The Exorcist when she's possessed and it's inside her, she writes on her chest 'Help me' from the inside.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, for his last major show, at the Gagosian Gallery in New York, Damien Hirst made a piece featuring a giant beach ball bobbling on a column of air. The ball was multi-coloured and the box around the air supply was also brightly painted and carnivalesque. It was a sculpture that suggested playfulness and buoyancy and barmy insouciance and all the things that people already associated with Damien Hirst. He was the recognised ringleader and alpha talent of the most startling artistic development in Britain in what we must now call the last century. Loving in a World of Desire was a refinement of A Celebration At Least, one of Hirst's most innocent and affecting apprentice pieces, in which party balloons, some of them partly deflated, float in front of a bright, striped party backdrop. It is a sculpture out of a time and about a time when all of it was easy and like a party. You had an idea and you grabbed it and - hey! - next day you were in the papers. Now he has produced an uncomfortable new piece which relates to these earlier works the way the fresh-faced young friend from one's youth relates to the stranger with the frail, wintering, chemotherapy look, passed unexpectedly in the street. All the colour has been leached out, and the easy optimism of the 1995 work has been replaced by what seems to be an overt acknowledgement of ominousness and even dread. The beach ball in The History of Pain is white - ectoplasmically white and precarious; the top of the box above which the ball is suspended is pierced by several dozen rasped and hungry Sabatier knives. The briefest choking of the air supply and the ball will be punctured and instantly shredded. The fragility of existence has been Hirst's big theme from the beginning. The action of the world on things. It's why he puts things behind glass, and in formaldehyde in big steel and glass cases: to hold off the inevitable decay and corruption; as part of a futile effort to preserve them. A friend misheard The History of Pain as The History of Fame and went on referring to it by this title. Which gave Hirst the idea of tweaking the original sculpture into a second version. The cloned work will be identical in every detail: same bubble-like inflated ball, same fierce long knives. The only difference is that The History of Fame will have an audience track - rumbles of anticipation when the ball drops close to the knives and appears to be in danger of bursting; groans of disappointment when it floats clear of the daggers and the carvers. The period of neglect for an avant-garde artist has shrunk for each successive generation of artists in the past 100 years. It is no longer possible - or it seems no longer possible - for an important avant-garde artist to go unrecognised. And artists are no fun once they have been discovered. Having soared so high, so fast, and having struggled with what he calls \"a difficulty with art\" for the past four years, Hirst knows he has arrived at a crucial point in his life and his career. He says that if his adventures in the catering trade and his other excursions have taught him anything, it is that if he's not an artist, he's nothing. But he believes he has been hearing the grinding of knives for some time now. \"The art world's very shallow,\" he says. \"The art world lets you down. It's very shallow and very small and it's very easy to get to the top of it. And then you burst through the top of it and you've got no idea where the fuck to go. You know, they've all been waiting for me to die. Now they're all phoning up. I've got so many people on my back trying to get me to make things, pushing in the wrong direction. It's a constant effort telling people to just go away. I mean, everyone's your friend.\" It can be deduced from the Sabatier sculptures, and from a number of the other sculptures that he has made for a major show in New York in autumn, that Hirst's first work of the new millennium has taken a turn towards the nakedly autobiographical. Care will be taken wherever The History of Pain and The History of Fame go on show to make sure that nobody can put a foot on the pipe delivering the air supply. He was drinking a Steelworks. This was a new one. Just soda plus a dash of Angostura bitters and a twist of lime. Non-alcoholic. But fashionable, because Damien Hirst was drinking it. Soon a woman at the next table was ordering a Steelworks, and then a woman at Princess Diana's old table behind the column, away from the window. It was Steelworks all through lunch. Then a hot-towel shave and a haircut. And then Coca-Colas all the way through dinner. Even at the after-hours club around the corner, he stayed stubbornly - and (because he isn't Damien Hirst for nothing) lairily, not quietly - on the wagon. The next morning he was bright and early and in boisterous high spirits, which an unscheduled taxi ride between Reading and his new studio in Gloucestershire - \"You're going to love my new studio\" - could do nothing to dent. For two hours, we got the story of the Ebola virus, complete with detailed descriptions of the vomito negro (\"Black vomit,\" Damien explained helpfully, \"it contains the lining of your lungs as well as blood\") and typical Hirst-like actings-out and grotesque embellishments. He'd read The Hot Zone through all of one night, pacing the bedroom of his house in Devon, heart pounding, his eyes on stalks, horrified and yet electrified by the horror. He's always working on sculptures. Even at his drunkest you can sense him thinking; always looking, looking, looking. It troubles him; he sometimes wishes he could stop looking. He's on the lookout constantly for something that can be used. In addition to a change of clothes, his luggage consisted of a copy of the Fortean Times, a copy of Viz and a heavy leather-bound academic volume on blood. The single word \"Blood\" filled the whole of the spine. Blood is the symbol linking most of the new work he has been making. Blood and smoking. Blood and smoking and violent death. Sometimes, such as in a piece called An Unreasonable Fear of Death and Dying, the blood is graphic, splattered all over the rugs and furniture and glass of the vitrines. In An Unreasonable Fear, a chainsaw saws an armchair in half and sharks play on a tape loop on the television; a can of Charm air-freshener (\"Nature's Way\") stands on the blood-spattered cistern, behind the door with the word \"Die\" finger-painted in blood. In other instances, the blood is merely implied. Adam and Eve (Banished from the Garden) features two corpses on mortuary trolleys, buckets, bones; an unfinished cheese sandwich rests on one of the corpses. Figures in a Landscape is a vitrine divided into nine cells. Each cell contains bulging black binbags deodorised with sachets of Haze concentrated fragrance gel and \"Superfresh Neutradol\". \"Stop me B4 I kill again,\" reads the message written in lipstick on an old wardrobe mirror. We arrived at his studio at a time when Damien is often just falling into bed. And immediately, as if to announce his arrival, the peace of the countryside was shattered by the sound of security alarms going. The alarms started going and then phones started ringing to say the alarms had been triggered. He couldn't find the phones. He couldn't find the switches for the lights. The codes for the digital pads to stop the alarms bleating were written on another piece of paper. There is a new piece called Looking Forward to the Total and Absolute Suppression of Pain, in which four TV monitors simultaneously and at ear-splitting volume play four different commercials for Nurofen, Solpadeine and other headache tablets. The first 10 minutes at Stroud was like being in an opened-out version of it. There was an element of theatre involved, of course. Hirst is a showman artist in the tradition of the Victorian decadents like Johns and Sargent. The 20,000 sq ft of studio in a Cotswold village is his recently acquired Xanadu; a bolthole to withdraw to and \"sit the fuck down and concentrate on working\". \"I love the fact that there's no windows,\" he said. \"It's completely separated and isolated from anywhere else. It's a personal space. It's out of London.\" It is a vast building. In addition to his own work, it houses work by Warhol and Peter Halley, and by Goldsmiths contemporaries like Angus Fairhurst, Sarah Lucas, Rachel Howard and Jane Simpson. There's a conference room and a dining room, a gallery and a kitchen with a walk-in freezer. \"I blame Charles Saatchi,\" Damien said. \"'Cause when I was an art student, I went down to look at his space and I just wanted one. Immediately. I mean, art looks great in there. Art looks great in here. So you make art for it.\" Inside, when the lights did finally come on, the immediate impression was of menace. It felt a dangerous place. In addition to the Sabatier knives jutting skywards, the whole studio had been turned into a labyrinth of steely, reflecting surfaces and lacerating, industrially-cut edges. There were (real) skeletons and blood; (prosthetic) human body parts arranged on shelves and bagged in binliners; surgical instruments and corpses. And towering above it all, the sculpture that Hirst refers to as \"the big guy\" - a 20ft, 10-ton bronze cast of an anatomical children's toy that Charles Saatchi was four days away from buying for \u00a31m to add to his collection. The whole of it the fruits of two years' labour and a million-plus dollars. Over the past 50 years the vocabulary of art has expanded towards the inclusion of everything. Everything seen in a certain way becomes art, is art. Children's plastic toys and cheap domestic detritus are scattered through Hirst's new work. It was seeing his son Connor, who's five, playing with the figure from Humbrol's Young Scientist series that made him decide to cast it in bronze. \"I might even get sued for it. I expect it. Because I copied it so directly. It's fantastic. I just thought it was so brilliant, and it was so accurate, it was like a chemistry set, and I loved it that it was a toy. I wouldn't have done it with a teaching hospital one. This is much happier, friendlier, and more colourful and bright. Like plastic! The paint on it's like skin. It'll decay. I liked it for that reason. Eventually what you'll be left with is the paint hanging off and this big, fucking grand iconic sculpture.\" At home in Devon he has a fish tank with fish in it swimming around in rubbish. One fish is from the village pet shop, the other's from the fair, and they share their tank with a pair of false teeth, a model shark, and an old beer bottle. \"It's like the bottom of a beck [a stream]. All trash in it.\" In his studio near Stroud he had two fish tanks, each room-size and each with a gynaecologist's examination couch in it, which must rank among the best - certainly among the most mysterious - things he has made. Lost Love and Love Lost are two complete gynaecologist's offices underwater. In one, hundreds of jewel-like African river fish swim around the forceps and past the coat-stand and through the stirrups of the couch. The fish in the other are big, black carp that have already started to impose themselves on their surroundings. In time, everything - the adjustable stool, the white examination coat, the advanced technology - will be coated with green algae. These are clearly works that cry out for prolonged critical analysis and deep psychoanalytical investigation. They are haunting (consciously so) and beautiful. Their creator, of course, refuses these kinds of \"higher\" interpretation. \"They're pretty direct,\" he says. \"There's something really simple. If you've got a gynaecologist's office underwater with fish swimming about, then there's something fishy going on. An' fishy fannies come straight after that. I think. In the logic of it. I quite like the idea that the doctor's had to take his watch and his rings off [they are part of the furniture of Love Lost], so that you get the doctor's personality into the hand that's going to finger about with you down there. The woman's got her shoes on the floor, and there's the coat and the handbag. So there's a hugely sexual element to it. An' women smell of kippers.\" \"I find myself becoming more and more yobbish,\" Damien Hirst once said, \"when I expected to become more intellectual.\" This has partly been a defence mechanism. His lack of house-training, a talent relatively recently acquired, has kept him out of polite society and therefore away from contaminating conventional ways of viewing the world. He has always used drugs and drink as a way of isolating himself from banal experience and to bring him to something original or extraordinary in the moment that nobody else can see. He has always drunk and drugged. But he has also always been a ham. \"It's about expectation,\" he says. \"It's theatre. It's about raising expectations and lowering expectations. I've always done that. Regularly, when I used to go to openings, I used to go in looking like a tramp. Then I'd go in in a suit, then I'd go in like a tramp... So people would just be going, Damien's losing it, oh wow, he's really on top of it, omigod, he's losing it, no he's on top of it... And they never know where the fuck they are. \"The way I got involved with the art world... You get people to think one thing, and then you come round from another direction. I mean, you do it in an art work. I think that's what all artists do. They draw you into some sort of belief system and then - bang! - they hit you with something else. The one-two. Bacon does it. With a kind of bareness of paint, or a sensuality... Michelangelo does it. Everybody does it.\" Damien has always been able to charm his way out of things that would get other men done over or put away. The hooligan genius of recent Soho legend seemed, through his innate taste and acute intelligence, to be incapable of putting a foot wrong. Sometime during the making of this current work, though, a subtle shift occurred. He was banned from the Groucho Club after complaints from members. He dropped his trousers in the bar of his hotel in Dublin last month, where he was directing a Beckett play for television, and a female guest is persisting with her threat to sue after he inserted a chicken bone in the end of his penis. More recently, Norman Rosenthal, the exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, arrived at the Colony Room in Soho and found Damien trouserless at the piano. \"So what's new! Will you tell me when I haven't done that?\" he says. And then: \"I think I've spread myself so thin. I was just drinking too much to be concentrating hard. So something's got to give. Blackouts. I used to never get blackouts. I get blackouts now. I got involved in drink and drugs, didn't I? Mixed. So it's a completely different thing. I mean, I always mix my drinks. I don't stick to one drink. And then I started taking cocaine and drink. And I think there's some point when you do that where it becomes a different drug in its own right. When you add two chemicals together, you get a different chemical. There's a balance I was after between a certain amount of this and a certain amount of that. Like a fucking alchemist. \"But then overnight I turned into a babbling wreck. It was completely overnight. I've spoken to Maia [his partner] about it. It happened like that... I started to blow gaskets and pop rivets. I mean, it's been incredibly hard work not doing anything for four years, in terms of the art world. And I haven't done anything for four years because until now I've not felt it was any good. There's a kind of hunger. Well, you just have to starve people. You have to convince yourself that the art world's not going to go away if you go away.\" Since his last major gallery show, he has concentrated his energies in the commercial arena. He went into partnership with Marco Pierre White at Quo Vadis in 1996; then he opened Pharmacy, a restaurant, with Matthew Freud and others at the beginning of 1998. He believes now that maybe the restaurants were more effort than he admitted. \"It just wasn't art at the end of the day. You end up getting involved in fucking aprons, knives and forks, pots and pans, all the shit of life that you don't really want to get involved in. Stocks and shares, ties, boots, Blu-Tack, glue, string... \"Doing Pharmacy made me realise why you're not allowed to touch art - why it says, 'Do not touch' in art galleries. You go in after a week and it's fucked, you know what I mean? It's like all the things that can go wrong in your house if you get shit builders in, combined with letting a herd of elephants rampage through the art gallery.\" Damien Hirst joke. Q: \"What's the biggest thing you've ever killed?\" A: \"My career.\" He says this is the clue to the lipsticked inscription \"Stop me B4 I kill again\" in the brilliant binbag sculpture. \"I thought it was quite funny to have that, as a kind of cry to the public... It comes from The Shining, where he writes 'Redrum' on the mirror. And in The Exorcist when she's possessed and it's inside her, she writes on her chest 'Help me' from the inside. Like trying to get out of your predicament. I said the other day to Maia that I feel a bit like I don't want to be Damien Hirst, and it's too late to do anything about it. I don't like being 'Damien Hirst', I've decided. But you can't avoid it. So I think on the next mirror I'll write, 'Help me.'\" Pause. Switch to camp delivery. \"I'm just trying to make the best of a bad job, really.\" Prolonged laughter.
