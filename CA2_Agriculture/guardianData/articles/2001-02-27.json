      "body": "<p>South Wales Police are seeking urgent talks with the game's authorities to prevent May's FA Cup final and the Nationwide play-offs being blighted by the same traffic gridlock in central Cardiff that caused thousands of supporters, mainly Birmingham fans, to miss the start of Sunday's Worthington Cup final even though the kick-off was put back by 10 minutes. </p> <p>The police match commander, Chief Supt Gerry Toms, said: \"We had 65,000 or so people inside the Millennium stadium, waiting for the game to start. How long do you wait to get everyone in, that's the problem. We have to sit down with the clubs and get better information so we can make preparations here in Cardiff.\" </p> <p>Paul Sheldon, secretary of the Redditch Birmingham supporters' club, said he was appalled by the chaos and demanded the authorities \"get their act together\". </p> <p>\"We had eight coaches and they all got there on time,\" he said. \"But we had trouble getting into the car park even though we had the right passes. We were shipped off to side streets instead. </p> <p>\"I know of some supporters' coaches that left at 10am and didn't get there until half an hour after kick-off. We also had problems leaving Cardiff with the roads congested and didn't get back until midnight.\" </p> <p>Chief Supt Toms said the problems stemmed from too many of the 73,500 crowd coming by road rather than rail. \"More [than expected] came by car so the car parks that had been prepared were over-loaded. That caused the queues. Cardiff railway station normally deals with 25,000 people on event day. Yesterday there were less than 10,000. </p> <p>\"Too many cars, too many coaches, all descending on Cardiff too quickly. The police are left at the sharp end.

      "bodyText": "South Wales Police are seeking urgent talks with the game's authorities to prevent May's FA Cup final and the Nationwide play-offs being blighted by the same traffic gridlock in central Cardiff that caused thousands of supporters, mainly Birmingham fans, to miss the start of Sunday's Worthington Cup final even though the kick-off was put back by 10 minutes. The police match commander, Chief Supt Gerry Toms, said: \"We had 65,000 or so people inside the Millennium stadium, waiting for the game to start. How long do you wait to get everyone in, that's the problem. We have to sit down with the clubs and get better information so we can make preparations here in Cardiff.\" Paul Sheldon, secretary of the Redditch Birmingham supporters' club, said he was appalled by the chaos and demanded the authorities \"get their act together\". \"We had eight coaches and they all got there on time,\" he said. \"But we had trouble getting into the car park even though we had the right passes. We were shipped off to side streets instead. \"I know of some supporters' coaches that left at 10am and didn't get there until half an hour after kick-off. We also had problems leaving Cardiff with the roads congested and didn't get back until midnight.\" Chief Supt Toms said the problems stemmed from too many of the 73,500 crowd coming by road rather than rail. \"More [than expected] came by car so the car parks that had been prepared were over-loaded. That caused the queues. Cardiff railway station normally deals with 25,000 people on event day. Yesterday there were less than 10,000. \"Too many cars, too many coaches, all descending on Cardiff too quickly. The police are left at the sharp end. It was like a quart in a pint pot.\" The Football Association and the Football League have struck a three-year deal for the Millennium stadium to host showcase events while Wembley is being rebuilt. Football's lawmakers will decide whether to make an international rule of the 10-yard punishment option, which has been on trial this season in the English and Scottish professional game, when the International Football Association Board meets in Edinburgh on March 10. The rule gives referees the power to move a free-kick a further 10 yards forward in the event of unsporting behaviour. \u0095 The Leeds midfielder Gareth Evans has become the fourth United player to face charges of assault and affray this year and will appear in court tomorrow.

      "body": "<p> Taking a gap year to travel abroad is the ideal way to break out of the cycle of study and work for many students in Britain. Prince William's recent, much-publicised stint in Chile has even given globe-trotting for a year between school and university a royal seal of approval. </p> <p> Prince William was one of among an estimated 23,000 students who deferred their entry this academic year to begin their course the coming September. What's more, an increasing number of students from all dis ciplines are spending a term or a year abroad at a foreign university as part of their course. </p> <p> Officials at the Erasmus exchange programme, the British branch of which is based at Kent University, say that at least 10,000 UK students are abroad in Europe in any given year as part of their studies. And throughout Europe there are more than 100,000 students mobile over the course of any academic year from the 2,000 European universities that participate in the Erasmus programme. </p> <p> But for a lot of students, whether backpacking or studying, a year abroad can be an uncertain and even nightmarish experience. A lack of familiarity with local customs and an ignorance of legal rights and working practices have caused many an upset for those who had set off with dreams of broadening their horizons. </p> <p> Alan Lansdowne, a graduate from Sheffield University, was almost beaten to death in a small town in Russia. As part of a year abroad for his degree in Russian and German, he was living in the town of Voronezh, situated about a nine-hour drive south from Moscow. Although Lansdowne, now 24, and his British friends were told not to walk alone at night, they began to flout the rules as they became more familiar with the town. </p> <p> One January night, Lansdowne was drinking with some friends and decided to walk home alone in the early hours of the morning. \"I got to a crossroads, and these guys were standing there, asking me to come towards them,\" he says. The gang surrounded him within minutes and started punching and kicking him. He managed to stagger home, the 10-minute journey taking him more than an hour. When inside the flat, he collapsed, waking his Russian landlady. He was taken to the local hospital where doctors found that as well as having extensive internal bleeding, he had also ruptured his spleen. </p> <p> Lansdowne later found out that his beating may have been part of a local ritual that none of the foreign students had been warned of. He was told by a Russian friend that the night he was beaten marked the beginning of the new year for Russian Orthodox Christians, a coincidence which may have been the reason for the events of that evening. \"The experience has made me wiser. I say to myself, if I can go through that, then I can do anything,\" he says now. </p> <p> As well as the thousands of students taking a gap year before starting their degree studies, there are many who do the same after graduation. Almost all of those who take a gap year before committing themselves to full-time employment say they need to see the world and experience different things before settling down. </p> <p> Burhan Uddin Ahmed, 25, from east London, was one of those students who wanted to see more of life after his studies. Having completed his MA in journalism studies at London's Goldsmith's College, Ahmed bought a round-the-world air ticket. He flew to Thailand and then on to Australia, but it was while in Brazil that he was confronted by a gunman. </p> <p> Ahmed, who recently returned to London, knew coach hijackings were frequent, but nevertheless decided to take a 14-hour coach journey from the north-eastern city of Puerto Seguro to Salvador at night. At three in the morning, passengers were awoken by a lone gunman who demanded money and valuables from everyone on board. </p> <p> Ahmed says he felt extremely nervous, as he was sitting near the front, very close to where the gunman was standing. \"I knew if the gunman started firing I would have been one of the first to get shot,\" he says. The gunman eventually fled after taking valuables and cash from all the passengers. </p> <p> Although he reached Salvador, he flew back to England shortly afterwards. Like Lansdowne, he now puts this traumatic event down to experience. </p> <p> Although violent cases like these are rare, other problems abound. Many British students abroad become victims \"of low pay, sexual harassment and downright exploitation,\" according to a recent survey by the BBC Essentials website. </p> <p> One in 20 of those surveyed said they had been victims of sexual harassment while abroad. \"Almost double the amount of boys to girls had been sexually harassed,\" explains Zillah Myers, the producer of the website. She adds that women were more likely to be paid a poor salary than men. </p> <p> The most popular jobs among gap-year students who earn as they travel were bar work and waiting on tables. But of the 509 people interviewed in the BBC survey, one-third complained of working very long hours, and a substantial number told how they were badly treated by their native work colleagues. </p> <p> Leighanne Springate, 25, was one of the participants in the survey. After graduating from Leeds University with a degree in maths and management in 1998, she travelled for a year before settling down to a full-time job as a finance manager. Part of her year out was spent in the US working in a children's summer camp. She was paid $800 for two months' work. </p> <p> \"The camp job was a nightmare,\" she says. On average, she claims, she worked for 13-14 hours a day, getting up at 7.30 in the morning, and finishing at around 10 in the evening. She now wishes she had found out more about the working conditions at the camp before setting off. </p> <p> Despite the potential pitfalls, experts believe that gap years are set to become even more popular in the future. Michael Snoughton, an official at the Gap Activity Project, believes that the reason behind this increased enthusiasm may be that students are more hard-up than ever before, and so want to improve their CVs - and maximise their earnings - by boasting of this sort of experience. </p> <p> Gap years, he says, have become steadily more popular in the past four or five years, as a university education becomes steadily more expensive. UCAS figures support this view. In 1994, they show that 14,530 students took a gap year, compared with 22,522 in 1999. Figures for this year are expected to be higher still. </p> <p> Snoughton, whose organisation offers a package travel deal combined with voluntary work, believes that gap years abroad are immensely beneficial to students, giving them different perspectives in the world of politics and culture as well as skills. \"Every 18-year-old should consider it,\" he says. But - even if the idea is to escape study for a while - they would be well advised to do their homework first. </p> <p> Survival guide </p> <p> When planning a gap year or a study period abroad, research your chosen region before setting off. If on a study exchange programme, find out all you can about the host university and its location from your own department. If on a gap year, get advice from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office about the possible dangers of visiting some countries (see its website). When abroad, note the telephone number and address of the nearest British Embassy, which can provide invaluable help in a crisis situation. Get vaccinated against illnesses like TB and malaria before you go. Take out good medical and possession insurance. Find out about work permits and other documents if you want to work in some areas. Illegal workers can do nothing if employers refuse to pay them. Don't carry much cash with you. Traveller's cheques are safer and ATM machines are in almost all countries. Don't go out alone at night in areas you don't know. Stick with a group of people you trust. In some countries, especially South American, avoid long journeys by night on a coach or by road. Highway robbery is frequent. </p> <p> <strong>Useful websites</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/essentials/\">BBC Essentials</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.erasmus.ac.uk/\">Erasmus</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/\">Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gap.org.uk/\">Gap Activity Project</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Taking a gap year to travel abroad is the ideal way to break out of the cycle of study and work for many students in Britain. Prince William's recent, much-publicised stint in Chile has even given globe-trotting for a year between school and university a royal seal of approval. Prince William was one of among an estimated 23,000 students who deferred their entry this academic year to begin their course the coming September. What's more, an increasing number of students from all dis ciplines are spending a term or a year abroad at a foreign university as part of their course. Officials at the Erasmus exchange programme, the British branch of which is based at Kent University, say that at least 10,000 UK students are abroad in Europe in any given year as part of their studies. And throughout Europe there are more than 100,000 students mobile over the course of any academic year from the 2,000 European universities that participate in the Erasmus programme. But for a lot of students, whether backpacking or studying, a year abroad can be an uncertain and even nightmarish experience. A lack of familiarity with local customs and an ignorance of legal rights and working practices have caused many an upset for those who had set off with dreams of broadening their horizons. Alan Lansdowne, a graduate from Sheffield University, was almost beaten to death in a small town in Russia. As part of a year abroad for his degree in Russian and German, he was living in the town of Voronezh, situated about a nine-hour drive south from Moscow. Although Lansdowne, now 24, and his British friends were told not to walk alone at night, they began to flout the rules as they became more familiar with the town. One January night, Lansdowne was drinking with some friends and decided to walk home alone in the early hours of the morning. \"I got to a crossroads, and these guys were standing there, asking me to come towards them,\" he says. The gang surrounded him within minutes and started punching and kicking him. He managed to stagger home, the 10-minute journey taking him more than an hour. When inside the flat, he collapsed, waking his Russian landlady. He was taken to the local hospital where doctors found that as well as having extensive internal bleeding, he had also ruptured his spleen. Lansdowne later found out that his beating may have been part of a local ritual that none of the foreign students had been warned of. He was told by a Russian friend that the night he was beaten marked the beginning of the new year for Russian Orthodox Christians, a coincidence which may have been the reason for the events of that evening. \"The experience has made me wiser. I say to myself, if I can go through that, then I can do anything,\" he says now. As well as the thousands of students taking a gap year before starting their degree studies, there are many who do the same after graduation. Almost all of those who take a gap year before committing themselves to full-time employment say they need to see the world and experience different things before settling down. Burhan Uddin Ahmed, 25, from east London, was one of those students who wanted to see more of life after his studies. Having completed his MA in journalism studies at London's Goldsmith's College, Ahmed bought a round-the-world air ticket. He flew to Thailand and then on to Australia, but it was while in Brazil that he was confronted by a gunman. Ahmed, who recently returned to London, knew coach hijackings were frequent, but nevertheless decided to take a 14-hour coach journey from the north-eastern city of Puerto Seguro to Salvador at night. At three in the morning, passengers were awoken by a lone gunman who demanded money and valuables from everyone on board. Ahmed says he felt extremely nervous, as he was sitting near the front, very close to where the gunman was standing. \"I knew if the gunman started firing I would have been one of the first to get shot,\" he says. The gunman eventually fled after taking valuables and cash from all the passengers. Although he reached Salvador, he flew back to England shortly afterwards. Like Lansdowne, he now puts this traumatic event down to experience. Although violent cases like these are rare, other problems abound. Many British students abroad become victims \"of low pay, sexual harassment and downright exploitation,\" according to a recent survey by the BBC Essentials website. One in 20 of those surveyed said they had been victims of sexual harassment while abroad. \"Almost double the amount of boys to girls had been sexually harassed,\" explains Zillah Myers, the producer of the website. She adds that women were more likely to be paid a poor salary than men. The most popular jobs among gap-year students who earn as they travel were bar work and waiting on tables. But of the 509 people interviewed in the BBC survey, one-third complained of working very long hours, and a substantial number told how they were badly treated by their native work colleagues. Leighanne Springate, 25, was one of the participants in the survey. After graduating from Leeds University with a degree in maths and management in 1998, she travelled for a year before settling down to a full-time job as a finance manager. Part of her year out was spent in the US working in a children's summer camp. She was paid $800 for two months' work. \"The camp job was a nightmare,\" she says. On average, she claims, she worked for 13-14 hours a day, getting up at 7.30 in the morning, and finishing at around 10 in the evening. She now wishes she had found out more about the working conditions at the camp before setting off. Despite the potential pitfalls, experts believe that gap years are set to become even more popular in the future. Michael Snoughton, an official at the Gap Activity Project, believes that the reason behind this increased enthusiasm may be that students are more hard-up than ever before, and so want to improve their CVs - and maximise their earnings - by boasting of this sort of experience. Gap years, he says, have become steadily more popular in the past four or five years, as a university education becomes steadily more expensive. UCAS figures support this view. In 1994, they show that 14,530 students took a gap year, compared with 22,522 in 1999. Figures for this year are expected to be higher still. Snoughton, whose organisation offers a package travel deal combined with voluntary work, believes that gap years abroad are immensely beneficial to students, giving them different perspectives in the world of politics and culture as well as skills. \"Every 18-year-old should consider it,\" he says. But - even if the idea is to escape study for a while - they would be well advised to do their homework first. Survival guide When planning a gap year or a study period abroad, research your chosen region before setting off. If on a study exchange programme, find out all you can about the host university and its location from your own department. If on a gap year, get advice from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office about the possible dangers of visiting some countries (see its website). When abroad, note the telephone number and address of the nearest British Embassy, which can provide invaluable help in a crisis situation. Get vaccinated against illnesses like TB and malaria before you go. Take out good medical and possession insurance. Find out about work permits and other documents if you want to work in some areas. Illegal workers can do nothing if employers refuse to pay them. Don't carry much cash with you. Traveller's cheques are safer and ATM machines are in almost all countries. Don't go out alone at night in areas you don't know. Stick with a group of people you trust. In some countries, especially South American, avoid long journeys by night on a coach or by road. Highway robbery is frequent. Useful websites BBC Essentials Erasmus Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Gap Activity Project",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, today called an emergency ministerial meeting in an effort to take control of the foot and mouth crisis as five more cases of the disease were confirmed. The new cases - including the first to hit Wales - take to 17 the number of confirmed outbreaks. Following today's meeting, Mr Blair extended a ban on animal movement to March 16. The current ban was due to end on Friday. The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, reported new outbreaks in Anglesey in north Wales, in Lancashire, County Durham, and Northamptonshire. A further case at an abattoir in Witton-le-Wear, County Durham was confirmed later in the afternoon. The news came as the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, indicated a possible easing of the ban on livestock movements to allow some animals to be transported directly to abattoirs under \"strictly controlled\" conditions. But Mr Brown also said that the government will allow local authorities to block access to public footpaths and rights of way. Statuatory powers came into effect at 2pm today to let local authorities seal off certain areas to prevent spread of the disease. As the crisis worsened, the Jockey Club announced that all horse racing in Britain is to be suspended for one week starting tomorrow. A rugby international meeting between Wales and Ireland - scheduled to take place on Saturday - has been postponed. Of today's outbreaks, the case in Anglesey is at an abattoir that has been under investigation for some time. The animal involved was transported from Yorkshire. The other cases were in Wolsingham, County Durham, involving a sheep bought at Darlington market; at Withnell in Lancashire, with an animal traced back to Hexham market; and a case in Wootton, Northamptonshire, traced to a farm in Devon. No cases have yet been found outside Britain, but other European nations are worried the highly infectious virus will cross the English Channel and are already taking precautionary measures. The French agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, has ordered the destruction of 20,000 sheep imported from Britain since 1 February. Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have also ordered animals imported from Britain to be destroyed.

Analysts have voiced mounting concern about United's exposure to the US technology market, with the sector providing a third of the group's profits. United today said that \"the outlook for the US high-tech market remains uncertain,\" although it believes that \u00a33.2bn it raised from disposals last year will see it through any difficulties. The company transformed itself last year into a business information group, dumping its old name of United News &amp; Media and its three ITV licences and the Express newspaper group. However, its reliance on business-to-business publishing has exposed it to the crumbling US technology market, which is reeling from a series of profit warnings sparked by a cutback in IT spending and a downturn in the US economy. But United is bullish about the future, after reporting pre-tax profits of \u00a3342m for last year, up 11% from \u00a3307m in 1999. \"We have transformed the group, selling our ITV, publishing and non-core B2B assets at premium prices totalling \u00a33.2bn and delivered our strategy to create a leading international business information group with a strong financial base for expansion,\" said Lord Hollick, chief executive of United. United's core businesses are its CMP magazine business, its PR Newswire operation and its United Information market research group. But United has yet to entirely turn its back on consumer businesses - it still owns 35% of Channel 5 and 20% of the ITN news service. Speculation is mounting that the company is on the verge of selling its Channel 5 stake to majority shareholder RTL, but the companies have very different opinions on the value of the holding.",

      "body": "<p>Hi Sam, I'm writing to tell you about my time in <strong>Malawi</strong> as I had a fantastic four months there.</p> <p> Firstly, Bilharzia: my thoughts are, if you worry about it you'll get it! One of the worst areas is meant to be Cape Maclear... we swam there and showered, although the guide books generally state that if you go near the water there you will get Bilharzia. At first we were cautious, but we met people who had lived in supposedly risky areas their whole lives and never caught it. There's lots of government research going on and it's all still a bit unknown. However, just in case, we decided to get the drugs in Malawi which combat the disease, they were only \u00a32 but would be about \u00a3100 in UK. I think the best advice is to swim but then go to a local doctor and get the drugs in case you get any symptoms. </p> <p> The places we visited at weekends: * Cape Maclear, a bit of a pain to get to, very beautiful but spoilt by the fact that the local beach bums are constantly hassling you to buy from them. We went here early on in our stay and thought we'd be back but found places that were twice as nice. Stayed at Steven's Lodge, and Fat Monkeys is also recommended. * Zomba Plateau, had drinks on the terrace of the Ku Chawe Inn, amazing view, didn't do any walking but friends walked down the \"Potato Path\" which takes you back into Zomba town and is very steep. * Played golf in Zomba... browns rather than greens! very friendly caddies! * Nanchengua Lodge, on Mangochi to Monkey Bay Road, amazing place, private beach and cool bar, family run while we were there but they were moving to Mozambique so may be in different hands now. * Travelled up to a school near Dedza and visited the famous pottery walking from Dedza itself, very nice. * Climbed Mount Mulanje, absolutely amazing and worth the pain in my legs for the next week! We were lucky enough to know a bloke from a mountain club through Africa Venture and he took us up although it was strongly advised against during the rainy season. We walked up on Saturday and stayed in a hut at the top, them back down on the Sunday. * Often stayed at Doogles in Blantyre which is a backpackers lodge (in Lonely Planet); it's brill (hot showers), however it had just been taken over the last time we stayed there and so don't know what it will be like now. They throw amazing parties though and even got me dancing on the bar one night!!! Oh dear! For the last three weeks of our time in Africa we were allowed to travel around freely before we had to meet in Harare for our organised safari. Watched a football match at the Mususu stadium in Blantyre which was definitely an experience!! We then travelled on the Shire bus from Blantyre to Nkarta Bay, this journey took 12 hours. Stayed for a week in Nkarta Bay at Backpackers Connection which was excellent. Some people went on the steamer up the lake and said it was spectacular although first class tickets must be booked in advance. The Ilala did also stop running while we were in Nkarta bay which messed up people's arrangements. Others stayed at Africa Bay which was huts on the beach. Nkarta Bay was fantastic: lots to do, boys did a scuba diving course at Aqua Africa which comes highly recommended. Loads of nice places to eat and cool bars. However leaving Nkarta Bay was extremely hard, bus didn't turn up for two nights and was full on the third night, so if you do go make sure you start to try and leave a few days before you actually have to be anywhere!!! (Our visas were about to expire!) Travelled back down to Blantyre then got on the Shire bus which goes from Blantyre to Harare but we got off in Tete in Mozambique where we had decided we wanted to visit the Cahora Bassa Dam (in Lonely Planet), very spectacular. Tete suspension bridge was amazing as well, very hot though. Got back on the Shire bus after a few days and travelled down to Harare. Safari around Zim was also brilliant!! I hope this info has been of help, just let me know if there is anything else you want to know. I'm off travelling again at the end of April. Fly to Cairns then six weeks travelling to Sydney, four weeks in New Zealand, two weeks in Rarotonga then a week in LA before flying home. I can't wait!! Take care, Charlotte</p>",

      "body": "<p>Foot and mouth is an ancient disease which thrives on modernity. It loves the black holes into which farm animals are crammed, and the debilitated condition in which they stagger through their miserable lives. But even more than that, it loves the long-distance economy which now governs the distribution of nearly all our food.</p> <p>By the time we knew there was a problem, half the lambs in Northumberland were in Devon, and half the lambs in Devon were in Northumberland, and the disease was emerging everywhere. Why should this be? Were there not enough sheep in Devon already? Do people in Northumberland refuse to eat local lamb? Do farmers take their animals on holiday?</p> <p>The long-distance food economy is a disaster for farmers, a disaster for the environment, a disaster for consumers and a disaster for animal welfare. But it's a bonanza for big business.</p> <p>Just as the big biotech firms have tried to capture food production through genetic engineering and patenting, so the big superstores and haulage companies have sought to capture food distribution, and the government, as always, has been only too willing to assist.</p> <p>Small slaughterhouses have been closed down in droves not because Europe says so (in France, despite the same regulations, hundreds persist and thrive), but because the Ministry of Agriculture has been pursuing a deliberate programme to wipe them out.</p> <p>As the superstores buy directly from the biggest and cheapest farmers, local livestock markets close, forcing those producers who don't sell to the big chains to drive their animals to markets ever further away.</p> <p>The superstores want to sell \"Scotch beef\", so they send cattle to pasture in Scotland for a fortnight, after which they can be legally described as such.

      "bodyText": "Foot and mouth is an ancient disease which thrives on modernity. It loves the black holes into which farm animals are crammed, and the debilitated condition in which they stagger through their miserable lives. But even more than that, it loves the long-distance economy which now governs the distribution of nearly all our food. By the time we knew there was a problem, half the lambs in Northumberland were in Devon, and half the lambs in Devon were in Northumberland, and the disease was emerging everywhere. Why should this be? Were there not enough sheep in Devon already? Do people in Northumberland refuse to eat local lamb? Do farmers take their animals on holiday? The long-distance food economy is a disaster for farmers, a disaster for the environment, a disaster for consumers and a disaster for animal welfare. But it's a bonanza for big business. Just as the big biotech firms have tried to capture food production through genetic engineering and patenting, so the big superstores and haulage companies have sought to capture food distribution, and the government, as always, has been only too willing to assist. Small slaughterhouses have been closed down in droves not because Europe says so (in France, despite the same regulations, hundreds persist and thrive), but because the Ministry of Agriculture has been pursuing a deliberate programme to wipe them out. As the superstores buy directly from the biggest and cheapest farmers, local livestock markets close, forcing those producers who don't sell to the big chains to drive their animals to markets ever further away. The superstores want to sell \"Scotch beef\", so they send cattle to pasture in Scotland for a fortnight, after which they can be legally described as such. They want Welsh lamb, so they send English and Scotch lambs to Wales before killing them. These practices, we are told, permit us all to enjoy cheap food. In truth, they merely force us to pay by other means, such as disease eradication programmes. The thousands of animals being burnt today are being sacrificed on the altar of supermarket profits.

      "bodyText": "The London mayor Ken Livingstone and his transport commissioner Bob Kiley are lined up against the government over the future of the city's underground system. Mark Oliver explains the issues. Has there been any progress on this saga? Not really, no. Tony Blair has closed ranks with John Prescott and Gordon Brown in their determination to force Mr Livingstone and Mr Kiley to \"knuckle down\" and work within the government's \u00a315bn blueprint for modernising London's Underground system. The government's public-private partnership (PPP) plan has been savaged by the pair. PPP should have started almost a year ago and with both sides so entrenched and talks barely sputtering along, you can expect more delays before a deal is agreed upon. What is PPP? It is the Treasury's concoction of a public-private partnership that would split the tube into four sections. Three of these would be run by the private sector on 30-year leases. Just one of the sections - the actual running of the trains and signals - would stay in the public sphere. The private sector would raise the funds and be reimbursed by the users of the lines, London Underground and the government. What are the objections to PPP? Mr Kiley, an American who has had success in rejuvenating similar underground networks in New York and Boston, has said that the proposed split-responsibility is unsafe and that a \"unified management\" is crucial.

He claims that what the Treasury envisions is essentially privatisation. What is needed, he says, is simple government funding of the necessary investment in infrastructure, which he estimates at \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m a year. \"The 'fatal flaw' is simply that the public will own the system but not control it\", Mr Kiley says of PPP. What is the government's position? It is complicated by their being two camps - the Treasury which wants to push through PPP and the Prescott camp, which is more open minded about alternatives and has some of Mr Blair's sympathies. Mr Kiley has painted a picture of Mr Brown, as \"the Wizard of Oz\", pulling the levers behind the scenes to control Mr Prescott, who is officially leading the talks. The cost of sorting the tube out could amount to \u00a313bn over the next 15 years and the Treasury appears adamant that this should be kept out of public accounts, which an unmodified PPP plan does very neatly. They don't want the taxpayer being ultimately responsible for the risk as they would be under Mr Kiley's vision. The Treasury's argument is that although the work would inevitably cost much more if done by profit-making, private firms, this would be recouped be heightened efficiency of private managers. Ministers are concerned that public sector management is irreparably inefficient. They point to the Jubilee line extension which doubled in cost to \u00a33.5bn and was completed 18 months late. The government are also concerned that if PPP were not adopted, it would also leave Aslef, the train driver's union, in a powerful position, as it showed earlier this month by just about closing the entire network for a day. How are talks going? On February 2 it was agreed that Transport for London and London Underground would have \"unified management of the Underground\" and that the commissioner would \"take the lead\" in making this happen, Mr Kiley said. However, he said that on February 14 senior government representatives requested a special meeting with him at which he was told the private sector must control the three new private companies being set up to provide and maintain infrastructure for the tube and that this was \"non-negotiable\". Mr Kiley now believes further talks under the February 2 agreement would be \"fruitless\". What do the private firms think? Frustration is the dominant emotion from the four consortiums left in the running. The companies complain that the delay - PPP should have been online by April last year - is costing them, and that they have had to shed scores of planners. There are noises of some degree of flexibility coming from the firms about tweaking PPP but not anywhere near the scale of change wanted by Mr Kiley. They definitely don't want to pour millions into a business if it is controlled by someone else. There are also complaints that any major deviation from the original plan would cause crippling delays as firms would have to tender their bids again. However, no one is going to walk away just yet, as doing so would mean losing the potential \u00a330m in compensation each bidder is entitled to if PPP does not go ahead. Why is it time for change? London's underground network has its roots in the 1800s: the world's first underground railway - between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street - was opened by the Metropolitan Railway on January 10 1863, with trains hauled by steam engines. Although the existing infrastructure is not quite that old, much of it does date back to the 1920s and it is just not able to cope with today's daily commuters, which number in the hundreds of thousands. The government reckons several billion pounds are needed to update the network to one that can handle that volume of traffic. Tony Travers, director of the London School of Economics Greater London Group, says: \"For decades the tube was subjected to pitiful levels of investment. Old wires were not replaced, tunnels were not strengthened, track has not been renewed.\" There was an increase in investment in the early 90's in the wake of the Kings Cross fire but the levels then fell again. Among transport experts there is a belief that chronic under-investment has compromised safety, which would leave the government ill-equipped to defend any disaster which claimed human lives. What happens next? There needs to be some light at the end of the tunnel and many believe this is only possible of the prime minister intervenes and introduces a better framework for either working out a deal between Mr Kiley or just pushing through with PPP regardless.

This information has allowed the government to formulate predictions about the extent of transmission and to justify drastic measures to prevent the disease's spread.</p> <p>But the crisis in agriculture is now preventing the continuation of that very research.</p> <p>A better understanding of how foot and mouth disease was transmitted dates from the last major outbreak. Glasgow University's head of microbiology and public health, Professor Oswald Jarrett said, \"In two of the worst areas, it was noticed that the disease had spread with the prevailing wind over a wide area.\"</p> <p>As a result of that realisation, researchers from universities' laboratories around the country explored how far particular strains of the disease can spread. This information proved very accurate when combined with advanced computer modelling. For example, in 1981 foot and mouth disease spread to the Isle of Wight from France, and the Ministry of Agriculture was able to correctly predict that the distance between the island and the mainland was great enough to prevent the disease from spreading.</p> <p>Key to proving that the 1981 outbreak came from France was research over the 20 years before that allowed much more reliable typing of diseases. Once the government could show that the type of foot and mouth in the Isle of Wight was the same as that across the Channel, it was hard to argue about its source.</p> <p>Specialists from university veterinary departments worked collaboratively over decades on this research, but it was the Institute of Animal Health that made the greatest breakthroughs. Because they have very secure containment facilities, they could most directly study infected pigs without posing a risk to the countryside.</p> <p>Twenty years of research revolutionised the understanding foot and mouth disease. But, that does not make the current outbreak less damaging. Professor Bob Ward, Liverpool's senior lecturer in farm medicine said: \"There is now a lot more we can do with vast amounts of information about this disease. But, we can't say that we'll cope better now than in the 60s. The ground rules have changed: the structure of farming has changed. But I'm sure that both these advances have been helpful.\"</p> <p>However, Britain's agricultural research centres are as paralysed in the countryside as everyone else is. Professor Donald Bloom, a Cambridge University professor of animal welfare believes that at the moment research is not affected, but that if the ban on non-essential travel to the countryside continues, veterinary discovery could suffer.</p> <p>Professor Bloom said, \"There is the potential that if researchers can't go out to herds, then serious damage could be done to their work. We do have research areas that will be affected.\"</p> <p>His colleagues agree. Professor Ward said, \"I've got a colleague who works with diseases in dairy cattle and it'll delay things. She can work on other things at the moment, but it depends how long the crisis lasts.\"</p> <p>Professor Jarrett said, \"It must have all sorts of ramifications for research, it's a real nightmare.\"</p>",

Key to proving that the 1981 outbreak came from France was research over the 20 years before that allowed much more reliable typing of diseases. Once the government could show that the type of foot and mouth in the Isle of Wight was the same as that across the Channel, it was hard to argue about its source. Specialists from university veterinary departments worked collaboratively over decades on this research, but it was the Institute of Animal Health that made the greatest breakthroughs. Because they have very secure containment facilities, they could most directly study infected pigs without posing a risk to the countryside. Twenty years of research revolutionised the understanding foot and mouth disease. But, that does not make the current outbreak less damaging. Professor Bob Ward, Liverpool's senior lecturer in farm medicine said: \"There is now a lot more we can do with vast amounts of information about this disease. But, we can't say that we'll cope better now than in the 60s. The ground rules have changed: the structure of farming has changed. But I'm sure that both these advances have been helpful.\" However, Britain's agricultural research centres are as paralysed in the countryside as everyone else is. Professor Donald Bloom, a Cambridge University professor of animal welfare believes that at the moment research is not affected, but that if the ban on non-essential travel to the countryside continues, veterinary discovery could suffer. Professor Bloom said, \"There is the potential that if researchers can't go out to herds, then serious damage could be done to their work. We do have research areas that will be affected.\" His colleagues agree. Professor Ward said, \"I've got a colleague who works with diseases in dairy cattle and it'll delay things. She can work on other things at the moment, but it depends how long the crisis lasts.\" Professor Jarrett said, \"It must have all sorts of ramifications for research, it's a real nightmare.\"",

Much of this would, however, come from publicly funded income-contingent loans. </p> <p>There would be less of a barrier to participation because there would be no up-front fees and money could be steered to institutions opening up access. This option could also provide an incentive to employers to pay the graduate contribution as a form of \"golden hello\", especially in fields where competition for graduates is strongest. </p> <p> AGAINST - this option would require additional public funds to replace the current private contributions to fees. This would put institutions at greater risk of further reductions in the level of funding per student. It is more likely that over time that public funding will be reduced as funds flow from an endowment fund and this source of funds will cease to be truly additional. </p> <p><strong> Institutional endowment</strong> </p> <p> FOR - this is one of the few schemes that could give universities increased autonomy and independence of action if the right terms are agreed.

      "body": "<p>The three most important letters for any American teenager who wants to go to college are SAT. It stands for Scholastic Aptitude Test, a multiple-choice general examination that often sets the path for your future. It has been a rite of passage for generations.</p> <p>But now the biggest \"consumer\" of SAT scores in the country, the University of California, is questioning their usefulness. The university's president, Richard Atkinson has recommended that the basic aptitude test, known as SAT I, be dropped from the entrance requirements, arguing that they put black and Hispanic students at a disadvantage.</p> <p>In its place, he said, his university would take a more \"holistic\" approach to assessing applicants, one that more closely reflects overall achievement in school.</p> <p>His announcement, delivered at the American Council on Education, has been a front-page bombshell around the country. It is hard to exaggerate the centrality of the SAT to middle-class American life. School life is increasingly oriented around the test, with teachers (who are judged on SAT results as well) taking more and more time instructing students on how to \"beat\" the test.</p> <p>Nervous parents pour money into extra-curricular coaching. Last year for example, 150,000 students spent more than $100m on SAT preparation courses. When Mr Atkinson visited a class of 12-year-olds at an expensive private school last year, he learned that they spent hours every month doing drills like studying long lists of analogies.</p> <p>\"The goal was not developing the students' reading and writing abilities but rather improving their test-taking skills,\" he said. After further investigation he concluded: \"America's overemphasis on the SAT is compromising our educational system.\"</p> <p>Mr Atkinson's proposals have yet to be considered by the university's governing board, but the fact that such a giant figure on the educational stage should question this shibboleth is significant enough. His remarks also have political ramifications, at a time when a newly-elected president is extolling the virtues of standardised testing and calling for more of it.</p> <p>It also dips into US racial politics. The policy of affirmative action (a system of preferences for ethnic minorities) was scrapped in California in 1996, and since then black and Hispanic enrolment has dropped. The SAT tests are a major factor here, as blacks on average score 198 points left than whites. For similar reasons, about 300 small private colleges have abandoned SAT I as an indicator of aptitude.</p> <p>Mr Atkinson has dived into turbulent waters. Many in the educational establishment believe that the right way to address low test scores in poor, black schools is to address their academic problems, not simply lower the bar.</p> <p>In any case, they argue, \"holistic\" testing (which are supposed to provide a broader test of achievement through school grades, interviews and focused single-subject tests) are just as open to systemic cultural prejudice.</p> <p>Private school pupils are more likely to have the confidence to shine in the limelight. In the absence of a unifying standardised test, universities and colleges could more easily be challenged on their acceptance criteria.</p> <p>It is a debate that goes to the heart of US education, which is lagging badly behind the school systems in mainland Europe and Japan. As part of the nationwide rethink nothing, it seems, is sacred.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4110260,00.html\">28.12.00: Degrees of separation<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4117185,00.html\">15.01.01: Small classes 'aid college entrance'</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28julian+borger%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=julian+borger&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Julian Borger</a></p>",

School life is increasingly oriented around the test, with teachers (who are judged on SAT results as well) taking more and more time instructing students on how to \"beat\" the test. Nervous parents pour money into extra-curricular coaching. Last year for example, 150,000 students spent more than $100m on SAT preparation courses. When Mr Atkinson visited a class of 12-year-olds at an expensive private school last year, he learned that they spent hours every month doing drills like studying long lists of analogies. \"The goal was not developing the students' reading and writing abilities but rather improving their test-taking skills,\" he said. After further investigation he concluded: \"America's overemphasis on the SAT is compromising our educational system.\" Mr Atkinson's proposals have yet to be considered by the university's governing board, but the fact that such a giant figure on the educational stage should question this shibboleth is significant enough. His remarks also have political ramifications, at a time when a newly-elected president is extolling the virtues of standardised testing and calling for more of it. It also dips into US racial politics. The policy of affirmative action (a system of preferences for ethnic minorities) was scrapped in California in 1996, and since then black and Hispanic enrolment has dropped. The SAT tests are a major factor here, as blacks on average score 198 points left than whites. For similar reasons, about 300 small private colleges have abandoned SAT I as an indicator of aptitude. Mr Atkinson has dived into turbulent waters. Many in the educational establishment believe that the right way to address low test scores in poor, black schools is to address their academic problems, not simply lower the bar. In any case, they argue, \"holistic\" testing (which are supposed to provide a broader test of achievement through school grades, interviews and focused single-subject tests) are just as open to systemic cultural prejudice. Private school pupils are more likely to have the confidence to shine in the limelight. In the absence of a unifying standardised test, universities and colleges could more easily be challenged on their acceptance criteria. It is a debate that goes to the heart of US education, which is lagging badly behind the school systems in mainland Europe and Japan. As part of the nationwide rethink nothing, it seems, is sacred.

Prince William's recent, much-publicised stint in Chile has even given globe-trotting for a year between school and university a royal seal of approval. </p> <p>Prince William was one of among an estimated 23,000 students who deferred their entry this academic year to begin their course the coming September. What's more, an increasing number of students from all dis ciplines are spending a term or a year abroad at a foreign university as part of their course. </p> <p>Officials at the Erasmus exchange programme, the British branch of which is based at Kent University, say that at least 10,000 UK students are abroad in Europe in any given year as part of their studies. And throughout Europe there are more than 100,000 students mobile over the course of any academic year from the 2,000 European universities that participate in the Erasmus programme. </p> <p>But for a lot of students, whether backpacking or studying, a year abroad can be an uncertain and even nightmarish experience. A lack of familiarity with local customs and an ignorance of legal rights and working practices have caused many an upset for those who had set off with dreams of broadening their horizons. </p> <p>Alan Lansdowne, a graduate from Sheffield University, was almost beaten to death in a small town in Russia. As part of a year abroad for his degree in Russian and German, he was living in the town of Voronezh, situated about a nine-hour drive south from Moscow. Although Lansdowne, now 24, and his British friends were told not to walk alone at night, they began to flout the rules as they became more familiar with the town. </p> <p>One January night, Lansdowne was drinking with some friends and decided to walk home alone in the early hours of the morning. \"I got to a crossroads, and these guys were standing there, asking me to come towards them,\" he says. The gang surrounded him within minutes and started punching and kicking him. He managed to stagger home, the 10-minute journey taking him more than an hour. When inside the flat, he collapsed, waking his Russian landlady. He was taken to the local hospital where doctors found that as well as having extensive internal bleeding, he had also ruptured his spleen. </p> <p>Lansdowne later found out that his beating may have been part of a local ritual that none of the foreign students had been warned of. He was told by a Russian friend that the night he was beaten marked the beginning of the new year for Russian Orthodox Christians, a coincidence which may have been the reason for the events of that evening. \"The experience has made me wiser. I say to myself, if I can go through that, then I can do anything,\" he says now. </p> <p>As well as the thousands of students taking a gap year before starting their degree studies, there are many who do the same after graduation. Almost all of those who take a gap year before committing themselves to full-time employment say they need to see the world and experience different things before settling down. </p> <p>Burhan Uddin Ahmed, 25, from east London, was one of those students who wanted to see more of life after his studies. Having completed his MA in journalism studies at London's Goldsmith's College, Ahmed bought a round-the-world air ticket. He flew to Thailand and then on to Australia, but it was while in Brazil that he was confronted by a gunman. </p> <p>Ahmed, who recently returned to London, knew coach hijackings were frequent, but nevertheless decided to take a 14-hour coach journey from the north-eastern city of Puerto Seguro to Salvador at night. At three in the morning, passengers were awoken by a lone gunman who demanded money and valuables from everyone on board. </p> <p>Ahmed says he felt extremely nervous, as he was sitting near the front, very close to where the gunman was standing. \"I knew if the gunman started firing I would have been one of the first to get shot,\" he says. The gunman eventually fled after taking valuables and cash from all the passengers. </p> <p>Although he reached Salvador, he flew back to England shortly afterwards. Like Lansdowne, he now puts this traumatic event down to experience. </p> <p>Although violent cases like these are rare, other problems abound. Many British students abroad become victims \"of low pay, sexual harassment and downright exploitation,\" according to a recent survey by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/essentials\">BBC Essentials website</a>. </p> <p>One in 20 of those surveyed said they had been victims of sexual harassment while abroad. \"Almost double the amount of boys to girls had been sexually harassed,\" explains Zillah Myers, the producer of the website. She adds that women were more likely to be paid a poor salary than men. </p> <p> The most popular jobs among gap-year students who earn as they travel were bar work and waiting on tables. But of the 509 people interviewed in the BBC survey, one-third complained of working very long hours, and a substantial number told how they were badly treated by their native work colleagues. </p> <p>Leighanne Springate, 25, was one of the participants in the survey. After graduating from Leeds University with a degree in maths and management in 1998, she travelled for a year before settling down to a full-time job as a finance manager. Part of her year out was spent in the US working in a children's summer camp. She was paid $800 for two months' work. </p> <p>\"The camp job was a nightmare,\" she says. On average, she claims, she worked for 13-14 hours a day, getting up at 7.30 in the morning, and finishing at around 10 in the evening. She now wishes she had found out more about the working conditions at the camp before setting off. </p> <p>Despite the potential pitfalls, experts believe that gap years are set to become even more popular in the future. Michael Snoughton, an official at the Gap Activity Project, believes that the reason behind this increased enthusiasm may be that students are more hard-up than ever before, and so want to improve their CVs - and maximise their earnings - by boasting of this sort of experience. </p> <p>Gap years, he says, have become steadily more popular in the past four or five years, as a university education becomes steadily more expensive. UCAS figures support this view. In 1994, they show that 14,530 students took a gap year, compared with 22,522 in 1999. Figures for this year are expected to be higher still. </p> <p>Snoughton, whose organisation offers a package travel deal combined with voluntary work, believes that gap years abroad are immensely beneficial to students, giving them different perspectives in the world of politics and culture as well as skills. \"Every 18-year-old should consider it,\" he says.

Survival guide When planning a gap year or a study period abroad, research your chosen region before setting off. If on a study exchange programme, find out all you can about the host university and its location from your own department. If on a gap year, get advice from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office about the possible dangers of visiting some countries (see its website). When abroad, note the telephone number and address of the nearest British Embassy, which can provide invaluable help in a crisis situation. Get vaccinated against illnesses like TB and malaria before you go. Take out good medical and possession insurance. Find out about work permits and other documents if you want to work in some areas. Illegal workers can do nothing if employers refuse to pay them. Don't carry much cash with you. Traveller's cheques are safer and ATM machines are in almost all countries. Don't go out alone at night in areas you don't know. Stick with a group of people you trust. In some countries, especially South American, avoid long journeys by night on a coach or by road.

As it is, more than 60 are likely to end up in east London in the coming months. </p> <p>The two headteachers spent their half-term break in South Africa to recruit for all of Newham's 14 state secondary schools and numerous primaries. This week they are moving on to Johannesburg for more interviews. A team from a second London borough, Tower Hamlets, is currently hiring in Cape Town and Durban. </p> <p>The two boroughs could easily scoop up a couple of hundred of South Africa's best teachers, much to the chagrin of the country's education minister, Kadar Asmal, who has accused British schools of \"raiding\" his own of staff they can ill afford to lose. </p> <p>The Newham team try to dress up their hunt for teachers to South Africa's best advantage. \"It's a reciprocal arrangement,\" says Lucas. \"We need teachers. It will fulfil their need for career development. If you're losing 10% of your teachers but 90% come back with their experience enhanced, I think that's actually to the benefit of South Africa. </p> <p>\"The situation in my school at the moment is that we have three South Africans and an Australian covering long-term vacancies. People go sick and I'm faced with this situation because there are no supply teachers.\" </p> <p>More than 1,000 teachers applied for interview in Port Elizabeth. They came from across the Eastern Cape, from privileged white private schools as well as from rural primaries in the once nominally independent homeland of Transkei. </p> <p>Recruitment is organised by TimePlan, the UK's largest teacher-supply agency. It flew the Newham and Tower Hamlets delegations out, and whittled the applicants down to those chosen for final interview. Lucas was struck by the high standard of applicants and the poor conditions they claimed to work in. </p> <p>\"The horror stories we hear: class sizes, lack of resources and lack of opportunity for professional development. I think these teachers have a very difficult time of it,\" he says. \"We're not going to take rubbish. These are good teachers who can't find decent jobs.\" </p> <p>Mark Conely was an easy choice. For a start, he teaches maths and physics. He is eloquent and, with a fiancee and young son remaining behind, committed to returning to South Africa, which defuses the politics somewhat. </p> <p>\"I would like to teach in a class of 25 pupils where I can enrich myself in terms of my skills,\" he says. \"I thought it would be a great experience to go to a highly developed country like England to gain knowledge in my subject area and compare the two systems. I see myself as the type of person who can go and stand in any classroom in the world.\" </p> <p>Conely is 35 and \"coloured\", or mixed-race. For nine years he has taught at Bertram secondary school in the \"coloured\" township on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth. The school has a good reputation with close to a 90% pass rate in the matric exams, nearly double the national average and far above most township schools. But the average class size is 45 pupils and there is a serious short age of text books and science equipment. The good students are despatched one day a week to a nearby university to use its resources. </p> <p>Conely's extra-curricular activities - he is a founder of the schools life skills programme - went down well. To the teachers from London, that demonstrated a dedication beyond the immediate demands of the classroom - another prerequisite for teaching in Newham. </p> <p>\"Mark seems to be a very committed, hard-working teacher,\" says Tooley. \"Look at the success of Mark's school. You don't get that unless the teachers are very committed.\" </p> <p>But it is precisely that commitment that Asmal, the education minister, fears losing. Conely is in the category of teachers - experienced in maths and science - that the country most needs. South Africa produced only 100 new maths teachers and 20 new science teachers last year. </p> <p>\"There is a disturbing trend for recruitment campaigns to be run in South Africa to recruit professionals due to the excellent higher education provided at our universities and technikons. However, those doing and supporting such campaigns often have little concern for the development needs of South Africa and the costs and effort that have been put into producing good-quality graduates,\" says Asmal. </p> <p>TimePlan recruits from a number of European and Commonwealth countries but its literature says South African teachers are particularly welcome in the UK. The agency argues that it is not plundering the country's teaching stock because there are more teachers than jobs available in South Africa, and those who go to the UK frequently return with additional skills. But it concedes that a major attraction for applicants is the high rate of pay in Britain compared with South Africa. Most teachers earn about four times as much in the UK and, although living costs are higher, taxes are considerably lower. </p> <p>Conely is torn. \"I agree to a certain extent with our minister. He's right to be concerned. There are doctors and other professionals leaving the country permanently. But we are a free market system. You must balance the right of the individual to move with the needs of the country,\" he says. </p> <p>Dawn Mbalekwa, 25, is more typical of the recruits heading for Newham. She trained as a primary school teacher but has no full-time experience. The young Xhosa woman says she wants to improve her skills and return to South Africa, but she freely admits that her primary reason for taking a job in Newham is to travel. </p> <p>\"Everybody in my class at Rhodes university got jobs [as teachers]. I didn't apply for a job here. I want to travel. I'll go to England and then maybe after that to Australia or America,\" she says. </p> <p>Until she sat down in front of the headteachers from Newham, Mbalekwa had little idea what kind of school she might find herself in. \"From what I've been gathering, I won't be going to one of the posh schools. I'm just lowering my expectations,\" she says. </p> <p>Then there are those teachers who have no intention of returning, if only they can get out of South Africa in the first place. \"Two of the teachers we didn't take were whites who were very discontented and we didn't feel they would be right for Newham,\" explains Tooley. \"We didn't think they'd fit in. There are 74 languages spoken in my secondary school.\" </p> <p>That is part of the attraction of recruiting South African teachers. Mbalekwa is black. She speaks English, Afrikaans and three African languages. She knows about multiracial environments. She has also been briefed on British racism, which may not be as overt as the kind she is used to but can be just as insidious. </p> <p>But even sensitivity to such issues raises its own problems. Many South Africans continue to call themselves \"coloured\" even though it is an apartheid term; some believe it marks out their community as having a distinct identity. Others just want to distinguish themselves from the black population. </p> <p>But Tooley is offended by the word \"coloured\" and insists on calling Mark Conely \"mixed-race\". He doesn't want to be called that either. </p> <p>\"That suggests that I don't have a race. I think you should just call me South African,\" he says, to general agreement.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Deep in the minds of most parents these days, there lurks an unspoken fear of what you might call \"the iron law of schooling\". The \"law\" is this: getting your child into a good school equals academic success, fulfilment and a long, happy life. Pick a bad school and the result is academic failure, lowered horizons and a lifetime stacking shelves. </p> <p>It was with these comforting thoughts that I sat with my partner outside the headteacher's study at a local primary school early one Tuesday evening last June. We, like an increasing number of parents, had decided to appeal against the school's decision not to give our son a place in its reception class. </p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of our case, it didn't occur to us that the appeal - which, after all, forms the cornerstone of the government's policy of \"parental choice\" - would be anything but impartial, fair and civil. The last thing we expected was an intimidating, ill-tempered slanging match in which the school's representative acted as judge and jury, chairing the meeting, directing the mute appeals panel and deciding what was admissible evidence. </p> <p>Perhaps on reflection we shouldn't have been surprised. As many parents of children currently receiving rejection letters from their preferred schools will testify, \"parental choice\" can be little more than a soundbite, given a selection process that is often arbitrary, opaque and unfair from start to finish. </p> <p>The attempt to inform parental choice through Sats results and league tables has left some schools oversubscribed by a factor of 10 or more. Without the certainty of a place, parents have to apply to several schools. The result is an educational lottery in which some children end up with multiple offers, while others receive none at all. </p> <p>This hands power to the oversubscribed schools, which are faced with the need to choose between a large number of children - all of whom meet their selection criteria. You don't have to be especially paranoid to imagine that this encourages a certain \"subjectivity\" in the way some select their intake. </p> <p>It is the resulting parental bewilderment at the lack of transparency that makes the right to appeal so important. It was certainly a sense of frustration at not being levelled with that moved us to appeal. </p> <p>The school in question is a good local primary. Not brilliant, but it is the place where all our son's friends from the neighbourhood go. Despite the fact that it had 200 applicants for 30 places, it was the school that we wanted for our son. </p> <p>We knew that we scored poorly on the school's three admission criteria as laid out in the prospectus. We don't live especially close - it's about a 10- minute walk. Our son has no siblings at the school and no special needs. </p> <p>But through our local network we learnt that the entire nursery class was being promoted to the reception class. Nothing wrong with that, except that the school's prospectus stated quite clearly that this would not be the case. What's more, we knew that many children in the nursery class fitted the admissions criteria even less well than our son - and we could name individuals. </p> <p>Unfortunately, despite its protestations of belief in parental choice, the government gives only very limited grounds for appeal. You have to prove that either the individual refusal was \"unreasonable\" - whatever that means - or that the child would have been offered a place if the admissions arrangements had been properly implemented. We decided to appeal on the grounds that, as the school's admissions practice was so obviously at odds with its stated policy, our son's application could not have been given a fair hearing. </p> <p>When we arrived for the meeting, we were at first daunted by the queue of hopeful parents who had also decided to take their applications to the wire. It looked like a long wait ahead. </p> <p>To our surprise the appeals committee was dispatching these supplicants at speed. No sooner had one set of parents shuffled in than they shuffled out again. </p> <p>When it was our turn we found out why. Appeals committees are supposed to be not only independent of the school, but seen to be independent. But there was the school's representative chatting with the three-member panel, in a clear breach of DfEE guidelines. It felt like walking into court only to find the prosecuting counsel enjoying a joke with the judge before the case. </p> <p>The school's representative - the \"presenting officer\" in DfEE parlance - then proceeded to effect introductions, outline the role of the appeals committee, and define (inaccurately) the basis on which appeals could be admitted. In other words he chaired the meeting. It was as if the prosecuting counsel, having had his joke, had then declared himself judge as well. </p> <p>Next he invited us to make our case. Given the complexity of the issues we had written out our argument. To ensure that we didn't miss anything, we read it verbatim. </p> <p>The presenting officer then went into overdrive, asserting that our argument was inadmissible and refusing point-blank to answer questions about the admissions policy. He claimed that the school had already consulted lawyers about its policy and therefore it couldn't be anything but completely watertight. By implication we were wasting our time. </p> <p>In the run-up to the appeal, the committee had asked us in writing to identify specific cases in which the school had not followed its own rules. At the meeting, however, the presenting officer refused to discuss individual cases (wrongly, as we later found out). He even refused to discuss our key point - that the entire nursery class had been promoted to reception - which would have given the lie to his claims that the admissions policy had been fairly implemented. </p> <p>We rebutted his points with mounting irritation. The panel said nothing throughout and as the meeting drew on we dropped the pretence of addressing the chair and ended up engaged in what was little more than a stand-up row. </p> <p>Had my partner not been a teacher in the same borough who fully understood the ins and outs of admissions procedures, and had we not spent hours poring over DfEE guidelines, we would have been swatted away like the other parents who had gone in before us. We kept hammering away at our case until it was clear that everybody was repeating themselves for the fourth time and the hearing ended. </p> <p>A few days later the appeals committee wrote to us with the news that that they hadn't actually come to a decision on our case. Instead they asked the school to reconsider our application. It came as no surprise when the school wrote back to us with the news that yes, they had reconsidered our case and no, they weren't going to give us a place. </p> <p>We felt we had only one course of action left open to us: we called in the local government ombudsman. Strictly speaking, his remit is simply the administration of the appeal. But the investigating officer hardly bothered with that, simply noting our \"serious complaints\" and that \"the school had not furnished any evidence to show that the admissions arrangements were properly applied.\" </p> <p> Instead the officer went into detailed criticism of the school's admission criteria. \"They were not easy to understand,\" he wrote, \"and there was no clear provision for a tie-breaker to deal with the situation that there may be too many children qualifying under those criteria.\" </p> <p>He also demanded that the commonly used catch-all \"special needs\", be more closely defined: \"Does it mean statemented educational needs or social or medical requirements, none, or all of these things?\" </p> <p>And he suggested that a section in the prospectus which states that the admission policy is based on \"the need to maintain an ethnic, gender and social balance\" is probably illegal. </p> <p>This was a pleasing vindication of our case. Even more satisfying is that the local education authority involved is now incorporating the ombudsman's ruling in its guidelines on schools admissions. The world will be a marginally fairer place as a result of our action. </p> <p>The headteacher subsequently left the school and the new head seems to have obeyed every one of the ombudsman's suggestions to the letter. \"We have amended the prospectus where necessary and in the future we will adhere tightly to what it says,\" he says. Oh, that all schools would play with such a straight bat. </p> <p>You could say the system works, because in the end we were treated fairly. But many parents would not have had the time, the confidence, the determination or the inside knowledge to ensure that their voices were heard. </p> <p>We decided to decline the ombudsman's offer of a new appeal and sent our son to another school. But we remain convinced that the policy of so-called \"parental choice\" has given too much power to schools. Headteachers often see parental rights - particularly the right to accurate information about why a child has been refused a place - as an irritation. As a result the admissions process is rarely, as DfEE guidelines state it must be, \"clear, fair and objective\". </p> <p>So those parents now contemplating rejection letters should not assume that justice will be done because of the self-evident fairness of your case. It won't. </p> <p>You need to be tenacious, clued-up and prepared to challenge people who appear to speak with incontrovertible authority. And the sad truth is that even the most bolshy among us aren't like that most of the time. </p> <p><strong>How to tackle an appeal</strong></p> <p>According to the DfEE, 53,400 appeals were heard in 1998, up 4% on the previous year. The good news is that 38% of them were successful.</p> <p>With your rejection letter the school should provide the address of the clerk to the appeals committee to whom all correspondence should be addressed (ie not to the school).</p> <p>You should write to the clerk stating that you wish to appeal. The DfEE says this should be done within 14 days although schools \"should not unreasonably\" reject later appeals.</p> <p>The admissions authority should then reply, setting the date for your appeal but giving you at least 10 days' notice.</p> <p>The DfEE Code of Practice on Appeals provides very limited and technical grounds for appeal. Any appeal outside criteria is likely to be a waste of time. So forget emotional arguments and study the guidelines carefully to make sure your case is admissible and robust.</p> <p>Prepare your case. Remember the school is obliged to answer all rea sonable questions. It is also worth mugging up on DfEE guidelines for the administration of the appeal to ensure you are dealt with properly.</p> <p>You are allowed to take someone with you for support at the hearing and they can make your case for you if you wish. You are likely to be feeling nervous and/or emotional so it may be best to read out your statement.</p> <p>If you feel the appeal wasn't fair, check with DfEE guidelines and then complain to your Local Government Ombudsman. It's an easy process. Re member they can order a new appeal but they can't overrule the school.</p> <p><strong>Contacts</strong></p> <p> To obtain the DfEE's Code of Practice on \"Schools Admissions Appeals\" and or its \"Schools Admissions\", call 0845 602 2260.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">Their website</a> contains a wealth of supporting material such as template letters.</p> <p>The Advisory Centre For Education has a booklet on appeals and a telephone helpline: 020-7354 8321.</p>",

Nothing wrong with that, except that the school's prospectus stated quite clearly that this would not be the case. What's more, we knew that many children in the nursery class fitted the admissions criteria even less well than our son - and we could name individuals. Unfortunately, despite its protestations of belief in parental choice, the government gives only very limited grounds for appeal. You have to prove that either the individual refusal was \"unreasonable\" - whatever that means - or that the child would have been offered a place if the admissions arrangements had been properly implemented. We decided to appeal on the grounds that, as the school's admissions practice was so obviously at odds with its stated policy, our son's application could not have been given a fair hearing. When we arrived for the meeting, we were at first daunted by the queue of hopeful parents who had also decided to take their applications to the wire. It looked like a long wait ahead. To our surprise the appeals committee was dispatching these supplicants at speed. No sooner had one set of parents shuffled in than they shuffled out again. When it was our turn we found out why. Appeals committees are supposed to be not only independent of the school, but seen to be independent. But there was the school's representative chatting with the three-member panel, in a clear breach of DfEE guidelines. It felt like walking into court only to find the prosecuting counsel enjoying a joke with the judge before the case. The school's representative - the \"presenting officer\" in DfEE parlance - then proceeded to effect introductions, outline the role of the appeals committee, and define (inaccurately) the basis on which appeals could be admitted. In other words he chaired the meeting. It was as if the prosecuting counsel, having had his joke, had then declared himself judge as well. Next he invited us to make our case. Given the complexity of the issues we had written out our argument. To ensure that we didn't miss anything, we read it verbatim. The presenting officer then went into overdrive, asserting that our argument was inadmissible and refusing point-blank to answer questions about the admissions policy. He claimed that the school had already consulted lawyers about its policy and therefore it couldn't be anything but completely watertight. By implication we were wasting our time. In the run-up to the appeal, the committee had asked us in writing to identify specific cases in which the school had not followed its own rules. At the meeting, however, the presenting officer refused to discuss individual cases (wrongly, as we later found out). He even refused to discuss our key point - that the entire nursery class had been promoted to reception - which would have given the lie to his claims that the admissions policy had been fairly implemented. We rebutted his points with mounting irritation. The panel said nothing throughout and as the meeting drew on we dropped the pretence of addressing the chair and ended up engaged in what was little more than a stand-up row. Had my partner not been a teacher in the same borough who fully understood the ins and outs of admissions procedures, and had we not spent hours poring over DfEE guidelines, we would have been swatted away like the other parents who had gone in before us. We kept hammering away at our case until it was clear that everybody was repeating themselves for the fourth time and the hearing ended. A few days later the appeals committee wrote to us with the news that that they hadn't actually come to a decision on our case. Instead they asked the school to reconsider our application. It came as no surprise when the school wrote back to us with the news that yes, they had reconsidered our case and no, they weren't going to give us a place. We felt we had only one course of action left open to us: we called in the local government ombudsman. Strictly speaking, his remit is simply the administration of the appeal. But the investigating officer hardly bothered with that, simply noting our \"serious complaints\" and that \"the school had not furnished any evidence to show that the admissions arrangements were properly applied.\" Instead the officer went into detailed criticism of the school's admission criteria. \"They were not easy to understand,\" he wrote, \"and there was no clear provision for a tie-breaker to deal with the situation that there may be too many children qualifying under those criteria.\" He also demanded that the commonly used catch-all \"special needs\", be more closely defined: \"Does it mean statemented educational needs or social or medical requirements, none, or all of these things?\" And he suggested that a section in the prospectus which states that the admission policy is based on \"the need to maintain an ethnic, gender and social balance\" is probably illegal. This was a pleasing vindication of our case. Even more satisfying is that the local education authority involved is now incorporating the ombudsman's ruling in its guidelines on schools admissions. The world will be a marginally fairer place as a result of our action. The headteacher subsequently left the school and the new head seems to have obeyed every one of the ombudsman's suggestions to the letter. \"We have amended the prospectus where necessary and in the future we will adhere tightly to what it says,\" he says. Oh, that all schools would play with such a straight bat. You could say the system works, because in the end we were treated fairly. But many parents would not have had the time, the confidence, the determination or the inside knowledge to ensure that their voices were heard. We decided to decline the ombudsman's offer of a new appeal and sent our son to another school. But we remain convinced that the policy of so-called \"parental choice\" has given too much power to schools. Headteachers often see parental rights - particularly the right to accurate information about why a child has been refused a place - as an irritation. As a result the admissions process is rarely, as DfEE guidelines state it must be, \"clear, fair and objective\". So those parents now contemplating rejection letters should not assume that justice will be done because of the self-evident fairness of your case. It won't. You need to be tenacious, clued-up and prepared to challenge people who appear to speak with incontrovertible authority. And the sad truth is that even the most bolshy among us aren't like that most of the time. How to tackle an appeal According to the DfEE, 53,400 appeals were heard in 1998, up 4% on the previous year. The good news is that 38% of them were successful. With your rejection letter the school should provide the address of the clerk to the appeals committee to whom all correspondence should be addressed (ie not to the school). You should write to the clerk stating that you wish to appeal. The DfEE says this should be done within 14 days although schools \"should not unreasonably\" reject later appeals. The admissions authority should then reply, setting the date for your appeal but giving you at least 10 days' notice. The DfEE Code of Practice on Appeals provides very limited and technical grounds for appeal. Any appeal outside criteria is likely to be a waste of time. So forget emotional arguments and study the guidelines carefully to make sure your case is admissible and robust. Prepare your case. Remember the school is obliged to answer all rea sonable questions. It is also worth mugging up on DfEE guidelines for the administration of the appeal to ensure you are dealt with properly. You are allowed to take someone with you for support at the hearing and they can make your case for you if you wish. You are likely to be feeling nervous and/or emotional so it may be best to read out your statement. If you feel the appeal wasn't fair, check with DfEE guidelines and then complain to your Local Government Ombudsman. It's an easy process. Re member they can order a new appeal but they can't overrule the school.

I hold two diplomas in art and design; a diploma in social work; a diploma in higher education; a BA in philosophy; a Master's in art history and another in gallery studies (exhibition organising).

Two points have been well established: first, that new industries arise around good research universities (eg Heriot-Watt, Cambridge etc), not at a distance; second, that intellectual property does not travel as easily as he thinks. This is because knowledge is of two kinds, organised in print and elsewhere (which does travel) and tacit (ie in people's heads, which doesn't). The Japanese were able to base much of their industry on our basic work because of the tacit knowledge they had of how to do things. In order to benefit from published knowledge a nation needs a pool of people trained in a similar way to those who made the discovery. Japan had this; India, China, etc, did not. </p> <p>I entirely agree with the waste of academic time spent on the Research Assessment Exercise and Quality Assurance Agency assessments. This arises because \"trust\" has been lost; the government does not trust universities to do their jobs properly and even vice-chancellors do not now trust their heads of departments, so control has been centralised both in universities and nationally.<br><strong> Emeritus Professor JF Lamb, Cupar, Fife</strong> </p> <p> Letters on education are welcome and should be sent to Guardian Education, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, faxed to 020-7239 9933, or emailed to: education.letters@theguardian.com.</p>",

And in anticipation of all those letters telling me that the Koran is very women-friendly; I have read it, and it isn't. But like the Bible, men will offer to interpret it for me in a different way, so I will see the light. Joe Phillips, Bingham, Notts Teachers not required I am due to celebrate my 50th birthday at the end of February and had been persuaded that the teaching profession was in need of qualified and experienced people like myself. I hold two diplomas in art and design; a diploma in social work; a diploma in higher education; a BA in philosophy; a Master's in art history and another in gallery studies (exhibition organising). I have spent some years practising design, further time working on exhibitions and some years as a social worker. I received a letter from Fast Track Teaching saying that I \"need to demonstrate a strong academic record as well as evidence of other skills and attributes\". Short of attaining a PhD, I am not too certain how I would demonstrate any further academic ability, nor exactly what skills teaching is looking for. Unless there is a coded message there about the actual age required? Perhaps people of experience are not required for teaching, after all. Martin Bradley, Clacton, Essex Research doesn't travel Christopher Ball is greatly mistaken when he states that \"Good research benefits everyone, not just the nation of origin\" (Higher, Feb 20). Two points have been well established: first, that new industries arise around good research universities (eg Heriot-Watt, Cambridge etc), not at a distance; second, that intellectual property does not travel as easily as he thinks. This is because knowledge is of two kinds, organised in print and elsewhere (which does travel) and tacit (ie in people's heads, which doesn't). The Japanese were able to base much of their industry on our basic work because of the tacit knowledge they had of how to do things. In order to benefit from published knowledge a nation needs a pool of people trained in a similar way to those who made the discovery. Japan had this; India, China, etc, did not. I entirely agree with the waste of academic time spent on the Research Assessment Exercise and Quality Assurance Agency assessments. This arises because \"trust\" has been lost; the government does not trust universities to do their jobs properly and even vice-chancellors do not now trust their heads of departments, so control has been centralised both in universities and nationally.

Find out from their teachers what will be covered in the terms your children will miss, and aim to at least cover the main topics while you're abroad. </p> <p>Another thing I'd suggest is that you seek out opportunities for your children to sample life in school in any of the countries you visit. It may be that this isn't possible, and of course it won't be possible everywhere, but if you're staying with another family for more than a week or two, and they've got children of similar ages to your own, why not ask whether your children could go to school as well for a few days?

      "body": "<p>The lecturer shortage crisis in colleges is set to get even worse as teaching staff desert the sector to find jobs in schools. Secondary schools, themselves desperate to plug the holes in their recruitment, are hiring further education staff via a loophole in DfEE regulations, which allows unqualified staff to work as instructors at the discretion of heads. </p> <p>There are many routes by which lecturers are leaching out of further education, but the lure of secondary schools, where they can be employed at higher rates of pay, even as instructors rather than as qualified teachers, is increasingly significant. </p> <p>Working through agencies rather than directly to a local authority, pay can be higher for instructors. An instructor earning a base-rate of \u00a312,000 per annum if employed by a local authority can earn up to \u00a316,500 for a 195-day year through an agency. In schools skills in art, design and computing are increasingly needed as the curriculum becomes more vocational. </p> <p>Sue Dutton, deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said she was aware of the drift, which she hoped would be stopped by new further education initiatives. </p> <p>\"The pay in schools is attracting full- and part-timers out of further education, though that is not the only way staff are leaving. The biggest drift out is to private sector employers. Any teacher who has a transferable skill in further education is open to a better offer.\" </p> <p>Natfhe spokeswoman, Sue Berriman said: \"People will be looking to other options.

      "bodyText": "The lecturer shortage crisis in colleges is set to get even worse as teaching staff desert the sector to find jobs in schools. Secondary schools, themselves desperate to plug the holes in their recruitment, are hiring further education staff via a loophole in DfEE regulations, which allows unqualified staff to work as instructors at the discretion of heads. There are many routes by which lecturers are leaching out of further education, but the lure of secondary schools, where they can be employed at higher rates of pay, even as instructors rather than as qualified teachers, is increasingly significant. Working through agencies rather than directly to a local authority, pay can be higher for instructors. An instructor earning a base-rate of \u00a312,000 per annum if employed by a local authority can earn up to \u00a316,500 for a 195-day year through an agency. In schools skills in art, design and computing are increasingly needed as the curriculum becomes more vocational. Sue Dutton, deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said she was aware of the drift, which she hoped would be stopped by new further education initiatives. \"The pay in schools is attracting full- and part-timers out of further education, though that is not the only way staff are leaving. The biggest drift out is to private sector employers. Any teacher who has a transferable skill in further education is open to a better offer.\" Natfhe spokeswoman, Sue Berriman said: \"People will be looking to other options. It is a sorry state of affairs. There are also quite a distinct number of part-time lecturers who do not want full-time work.\" Keith Sorrel is a graphic designer and lecturer in desktop publishing who is amazed to find himself enjoying working as a supply teacher in secondary schools. He also works two days a week for the graphics firm which first steered him into part-time further education vocational lecturing, work he thoroughly enjoyed. \"In recent years, though, the paperwork has increased ten-fold.

On December 13 came an abstruse document, \"Technical paper on school sixth-form funding - views invited\", accompanied by a pledge from Wicks that no sixth form would suffer financially so long as it maintained its numbers.

It urged that a new system of income-contingent loans, together with high-quality advice and guidance services, should be available for adult learners pursuing recognised qualifications.</p> <p>The report on student finance was compiled by Derek Wanless, group chief executive of NatWest bank, at the request of education secretary David Blunkett after the task force's first report. No one outside the DfEE has officially read it, but it is assumed to consider the case for student loans in further education.</p> <p>In 1988 the Tories introduced their own loan system for the sector. So-called Career Development Loans (CDLs) still exist - although according to Mick Fletcher, LSDA development adviser, the take-up has hardly been high. In total only 105,000loans - whose average value has risen from \u00a32,500 to \u00a33,500 - have been taken out. Yet for people who who did finance themselves this way, the loans played a key role in their decision to study. More than 80% said they would not otherwise have done the training the loans supported.</p> <p>Many CDLs, Fletcher notes, financed courses which were not available at subsidised rates in the public sector, such as flying lessons or HGV driver training.</p> <p>Recent research has established that over a quarter of further education students are in debt, while more than half have experienced financial hardship. Fletcher asked two groups - the first aged 16 to 24, the second aged 25 to 54, both including employed and unemployed people - whether they would be prepared to borrow money to finance further education and training. Generally they said that if learning costs were less than \u00a31,000 they would try to avoid formal loans. Above that, they said, they would need a loan or a grant.</p> <p>What emerged quite clearly, however, was that people did not like straight repayment loans such as the CDL. \"There was a very clear preference for the features of the higher education loan, and the critical factor was income contingency,\" says Fletcher.</p> <p>Unlike the higher education sector, where students show an antipathy to student loans, in further education this was not the case. This may be because, unlike in higher education, where loans were introduced just as maintenance grants were being scrapped, there has been no comparable prior support in the FE sector.</p> <p>Fletcher points out that less than a third of further education students actually pay for tuition.</p> <p>Fees at further education colleges are generally not high, and are usually considerably cheaper than private training courses - most students who pay are liable for less than \u00a3100. Those who don't have to pay fees are exempt because they are between 16 and 19, because they get unemployment benefit or income support, or because they satisfy individual colleges' exemption policies.</p> <p>A significant factor in a student's willingness to take out a loan would be the financial returns of the qualification gained. Recent research has shown that lower-level national vocational qualifications, for instance, do not yield significant economic return, but that the returns to qualifications at level 3 and over are significant.</p>",

A significant minority of students aged 19 and over would consider borrowing if they felt confident that a course would benefit them financially, and that repayments would be suspended if they became ill or lost their job, according to a report by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA). Despite the apparent link between dips in university recruitment this year and higher education student loans, the government is thought to be considering a loan scheme. Last summer the third report of the National Skills Task Force explicitly recommended that loans should be available to help adults cover learning costs. It urged that a new system of income-contingent loans, together with high-quality advice and guidance services, should be available for adult learners pursuing recognised qualifications. The report on student finance was compiled by Derek Wanless, group chief executive of NatWest bank, at the request of education secretary David Blunkett after the task force's first report. No one outside the DfEE has officially read it, but it is assumed to consider the case for student loans in further education. In 1988 the Tories introduced their own loan system for the sector. So-called Career Development Loans (CDLs) still exist - although according to Mick Fletcher, LSDA development adviser, the take-up has hardly been high. In total only 105,000loans - whose average value has risen from \u00a32,500 to \u00a33,500 - have been taken out. Yet for people who who did finance themselves this way, the loans played a key role in their decision to study. More than 80% said they would not otherwise have done the training the loans supported. Many CDLs, Fletcher notes, financed courses which were not available at subsidised rates in the public sector, such as flying lessons or HGV driver training. Recent research has established that over a quarter of further education students are in debt, while more than half have experienced financial hardship. Fletcher asked two groups - the first aged 16 to 24, the second aged 25 to 54, both including employed and unemployed people - whether they would be prepared to borrow money to finance further education and training. Generally they said that if learning costs were less than \u00a31,000 they would try to avoid formal loans. Above that, they said, they would need a loan or a grant. What emerged quite clearly, however, was that people did not like straight repayment loans such as the CDL. \"There was a very clear preference for the features of the higher education loan, and the critical factor was income contingency,\" says Fletcher. Unlike the higher education sector, where students show an antipathy to student loans, in further education this was not the case. This may be because, unlike in higher education, where loans were introduced just as maintenance grants were being scrapped, there has been no comparable prior support in the FE sector. Fletcher points out that less than a third of further education students actually pay for tuition. Fees at further education colleges are generally not high, and are usually considerably cheaper than private training courses - most students who pay are liable for less than \u00a3100. Those who don't have to pay fees are exempt because they are between 16 and 19, because they get unemployment benefit or income support, or because they satisfy individual colleges' exemption policies. A significant factor in a student's willingness to take out a loan would be the financial returns of the qualification gained. Recent research has shown that lower-level national vocational qualifications, for instance, do not yield significant economic return, but that the returns to qualifications at level 3 and over are significant.",

A judge ruled that the Home Office's National Asylum Support Service (NASS) applied only to refugees whose need for support and accommodation arose \"solely\" from their destitution, and not to those who were also in need because of sickness, disablement or old age. The ruling will dismay councils across the country, but will hit hardest those in the south-east, such as Kent and the London borough of Hillingdon, that cover major ports of entry and so bear the brunt of rising levels of asylum seekers. The decision, based on a strict interpretation of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act which introduced NASS, was a defeat for Westminster city council in its bid to recover the cost of supporting asylum seekers with such special needs. It is understood from the ruling that NASS will continue to pay basic allowances for areas such as accommodation, but anything extra will now have to be paid for by councils. Kent leader Sandy Bruce-Lockhart hit out at the ruling, and called for assurances from the government that ministers would meet the additional costs. \"It seems an extraordinary judgement,\" he commented. Mr Justice Stanley Burnton granted Westminster permission to launch an urgent appeal after being told that the authority faced the prospect of having to support \"possibly several thousand people\" at a cost for which it was unprepared. Westminster had described as \"absurd\" the government's claim - upheld by the judge - that local government must shoulder the burden of supporting those very asylum seekers whose needs were the greatest and most costly to provide for. The judge agreed that the result was \"curious\" and left \"a number of incongruities\", but he was driven to that conclusion by the wording of the Act, in particular the use of the word \"solely\". The council had challenged the refusal of NASS to accept responsibility for Sabiha Mirza Y-Ahmad, 49, an Iraqi Kurd asylum seeker fleeing from Saddam's regime, and her 13-year-old daughter. Mrs Y-Ahmad is not only destitute, but is confined to a wheelchair by spinal myeloma, for which she is being treated at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. The judge said Mrs Y-Ahmad therefore required, in addition to her essential living needs, accommodation with wheelchair access within reach of St Mary's and with enough space for her daughter and carers. At present, she was staying at a west London hotel at a cost of \u00a3176 per day.",

The party's alternative budget, published yesterday and forming the basis of its manifesto, reaffirms the Lib Dems' best-known policy - an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax to fund an increase of \u00a33bn a year for education. The party will also stand apart from Labour and the Tories in pledging a new top tax band, introducing a 50p rate for those earning over \u00a3100,000. The extra income created by this and changes to capital gains tax would go towards new investment in the health service, including an average extra \u00a31,000 a year for nurses, an extra 11,000 hospital beds and guaranteed access to NHS dentists. The proposals leave the Lib Dems as the sole defenders of increased taxation. The Tories are proposing \u00a38bn tax cuts, and the chancellor Gordon Brown - though not expected to cut income tax in next week's budget - will not increase rates amid revelations of a \u00a316bn budget surplus. However, the Lib Dems will go into the general election in sisting that, while they may be raising income taxes they will forego \"stealth taxes\" imposed by the chancellor. The Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, yesterday said his party's proposals offered transparency: \"Labour may be taxing more but they are not spending more.\" The party proposes sending every taxpayer an annual \"citizen's tax contract\", spelling out exactly how much tax is being raised. The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, said the proposals amounted to an \"honest, fully costed\" package of investment in health, education and pensions. Labour said the plans did not add up and suggested that the Lib Dem policy of a penny on income tax for education, which dates back to before the 1997 general election, would not raise enough money to match Labour's education spending. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith, called the plans \"a menu without prices... uncosted promises funded over and over again by the same tax increases. \"In their 1997 election manifesto, the Lib Dems pledged \u00a33.5bn extra for the NHS over five years but with Labour, between 2000 and 2004, NHS investment is set to grow by a third in real terms,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "A further split has ocurred in the United Kingdom Independence party after an executive member and five-time candidate endorsed the rightwing historian David Irving's denial of the Holocaust. Alistair McConnachie caused resignations from the party when he wrote to the Scottish press saying the Pope had been duped over the Holocaust and attacked the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Mark Lester, the party's London candidate for the Euro elections, has resigned after the executive (which includes two MEPs) rescinded a decision to expel Mr McConnachie for five years, saying he had a private right to \"freedom of speech\". Documents passed to the Guardian show Mr McConnachie took a far stronger line in emails to party members. He wrote to one critic, executive member Christopher Skeate, saying: \" I don't accept that gas chambers were used to execute Jews for the simple fact there is no direct physical evidence to show that such gas chambers ever existed... there are no photographs or film of execution gas chambers... Alleged eyewitness accounts are revealed as false or highly exaggerated.\" Mr McConnachie has publicly said the Pope had been misled about numbers of Jews killed at Auschwitz, and has accused the board of deputies of \"seeking to establish a monopoly in the marketplace of ideas\" because it complained to the BBC about the handling of Mr Irving's views. Mr Lester initially complained about the letters. Minutes of a party disciplinary hearing show it expelled Mr McConnachie for five years for bringing the party into disrepute, though it defended his right to free speech. This month the executive commuted the penalty to a year's suspension from the executive. Mr McConnachie remains listed as Scottish organiser on UKIP's website, and no publicity has been given to the action taken. Yesterday he defended his \"private right to free speech within the law\" and stood by every word in his emails. \"The executive did rule I had the right to free speech about an historical situation,\" he said. Mr Lester yesterday expressed his \"anger and disgust\". He wrote to the party secretary, Michael Harvey, saying: \"I wish I could say I wish you and the party success in the future - I don't.\" He had been put in a totally unacceptable position \"as the guarantor to the Jewish community and the media that [the party's] leadership would not countenance individuals with anti-semitic or similarly disturbing viewpoints - the executive is happy to have a supporter of David Irving as a member and activist, so long as he is not on the executive for one year.\" Mr Harvey said yesterday Mr McConnachie had brought the party into disrepute, and he had yet to apply to be a candidate at the general election.",

The Rapp Collins network will create a marketing campaign to build direct contact with potential users of the drug across Europe. The agency won the pan-European, multimillion-pound account after a competitive pitch. The campaign is likely to work in conjunction with Viagra's brand advertising to offer men advice on impotence. UK and European regulations prohibit the promotion of prescription drugs directly to the consumer. But health education and corporate advertising are permitted to promote drugs as long as the promotions do not amount to disguised brand advertising. McCann-Erickson handles Viagra's \u00a314m pan-European advertising. The agency picked up the account last year after a pitch against Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Publicis. Pfizer consolidated its \u00a3482m US media planning and buying account into Carat New York earlier this month, sparking a similar media pitch in the UK. The media consolidation was sparked by Pfizer's \u00a362bn acquisition of rival Warner-Lambert last year. Related story Feb 9: Pfizer smartens up with 'functional foods'",

      "bodyText": "There is a standard advertising industry procedure for dealing with recession. First, deny there is one. This can go on for a year or more - until those denying start losing their own jobs. Then, when the impact is clear (ie revenue has collapsed), frantically attack your cost base. Start with banning Post-It notes, and then taxis, but move quickly on to people, often the more senior because they save you the most money. Immediately scrap trainees and training. Next, spend two years listening to clients telling you they are not satisfied with your pared-down agency's performance. They use this as an excuse to reduce your income, and eventually move their account. This you will replace by sacrificing margin to steal business on price from another pared-down agency.

      "bodyText": "Channel 5 bosses last night defended their proposal to abandon news in peaktime and move the evening bulletin to a slot that will compete with Neighbours on BBC1. The station has already moved the bulletin three times but it is struggling to get audiences at 6pm. Bosses at the station last night defended the latest plan to move the news to an even earlier slot of 5.30pm. They claimed the time might not be peaktime in London but it would be peaktime in the north. The station is in talks with regulators about a new slot that will position the news against the formidable competition of Neighbours on BBC1 and Wheel of Fortune on ITV. Channel 5 marketing director Jim Hytner said moving the news would ensure a bigger audience for the news broadcast because it would no longer compete with BBC1's bulletin. \"We're discussing the move with the Independent Television Commission at the moment,\" he said. \"Our licence requires us to broadcast news in peaktime, which, at the moment, is defined as 6pm to 10.30pm. \"But for many people outside London, peaktime begins earlier. In Leeds and Liverpool, people tend to be at home by 5.30pm and they have no problem with switching the TV on to watch the news at that time,\" he said at last night's Mediatel Media Question Time at the BBC's Radio Theatre. Channel 5's licence states it must broadcast at least 15 minutes of news in peaktime for the first five years of its existence. The channel originally proposed to broadcast the news at 8.30pm but changed the time to 8pm before it launched. Fronted by Kirsty Young perching on a newsdesk, its maverick style broke new ground and won the hearts and minds of younger viewers. At one stage it was being watched by as many as 900,000 viewers and even managed on at least one occasion to beat Channel 4 news in the ratings. It then brought the news forward to 7pm and again to 6pm, where it has been for the past two years. The ITC is now looking at Channel 5's request and is expected to look favourably on the proposal.",

Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England battled treacherous conditions overnight and forecasters have warned that the weather is edging south. Motorists stranded by snowdrifts were forced to spend the night in their vehicles, while all Virgin trains to and from Scotland were cancelled amid reports of snow on the rails \"as high as the platforms\". Seventy passengers were stranded just north of Lockerbie on an overnight train from London when it got stuck behind a broken-down train. The conditions meant the train, which left London 14 hours earlier, could not be towed north. A ScotRail spokesman said that the passengers would have to be taken south to Carlisle and put up in a hotel. Elsewhere on the railways, 120 people were stranded on the 6.32am train from Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, to Glasgow, after it became stuck in snow. A snowplough was used in an attempt to reach the stranded train 10 miles north of Kilmarnock to free the passengers and get refreshments to them. \"The snow is causing major problems and the high winds have made things even more difficult because of the drifting,\" the spokesman said. No sleepers will be run from London tonight. Flights to and from Scotland have also been cancelled, while police closed roads and warned drivers against trying to make any journeys unless they were absolutely essential. Strathclyde Police said major road routes including the M74 and M77 motorways were blocked in parts. More than 100,000 homes in Scotland were left without power as electricity company workers fought to reach cables knocked down or damaged by winds gusting up to 70 mph. Scottish Power said the worst affected areas were from central eastern Scotland, including Fife and East Lothian, down to the Scottish Borders. Hundreds of schools are expected to remain closed. In Northern Ireland, up to 70,000 homes were left without power as heavy snow and fierce winds caused widespread damage to the electricity network. Air, sea and rail services were seriously disrupted by winds of 70 mph and scores of schools were closed. Northern Ireland Electricity warned it could be tomorrow before all supplies were restored. County Antrim and County Down were the worst affected areas. In Northumberland, the A1 was closed between Alnwick and Scotland due to heavy snow and fallen power cables, while police advised drivers against using the A68, A696 and the A697.

It's hard to exaggerate just what a drizzlingly depressing fellow the agriculture minister is. If a stunned mullet could talk, it would sound like him. He is glum, depressive, dank and dreary. He is the Leonard Cohen of British politics.

He is glum, depressive, dank and dreary. He is the Leonard Cohen of British politics.

      "body": "<p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, yesterday accused the Tories of undermining government attempts to wipe out foot and mouth disease after the Tories tabled a lengthy House of Commons debate on the issue for tomorrow.</p> <p>To uproar on the Tory benches, Mr Brown said: \"It will divert resources, both ministerial resources and scarce veterinary resources, from the frontline which is bearing down on this disease.\"</p> <p>Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture minister, infuriated Mr Brown when he announced that the Tories would devote half of tomorrow's opposition day debate to the foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>Mr Brown, who will have to take part in the debate, accused the Tories of hypocrisy for announcing the debate while pledging to help the government. \"If their idea of helping is to divert resources from dealing with the disease outbreak to dealing with a parliamentary debate, including ministerial time, I'm glad they're not setting out to disrupt us,\" he said.</p> <p>The spat between Mr Brown and Mr Yeo came as some surprise because both sides attempted to mend fences after they clashed last week on the government's initial response to the crisis.</p> <p>Mr Yeo opened by offering his support for the measures. He said: \"We on this side of the house, in the opposition, will give our full backing to all the measures that are needed to contain the spread of foot and mouth disease, to assist livestock farmers through the crisis, to maintain food supplies and to restore export markets.\"</p> <p>But Mr Brown snapped when Mr Yeo criticised the government for not setting aside time for a Commons debate on the crisis. Announcing that the Tories would hold the debate in their own time, Mr Yeo asked: \"Do you recognise that the heartbreaking prospect for many farmers today is not just the loss of their livelihood, but the destruction of their lives work?

      "bodyText": "Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, yesterday accused the Tories of undermining government attempts to wipe out foot and mouth disease after the Tories tabled a lengthy House of Commons debate on the issue for tomorrow. To uproar on the Tory benches, Mr Brown said: \"It will divert resources, both ministerial resources and scarce veterinary resources, from the frontline which is bearing down on this disease.\" Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture minister, infuriated Mr Brown when he announced that the Tories would devote half of tomorrow's opposition day debate to the foot and mouth crisis. Mr Brown, who will have to take part in the debate, accused the Tories of hypocrisy for announcing the debate while pledging to help the government. \"If their idea of helping is to divert resources from dealing with the disease outbreak to dealing with a parliamentary debate, including ministerial time, I'm glad they're not setting out to disrupt us,\" he said. The spat between Mr Brown and Mr Yeo came as some surprise because both sides attempted to mend fences after they clashed last week on the government's initial response to the crisis. Mr Yeo opened by offering his support for the measures. He said: \"We on this side of the house, in the opposition, will give our full backing to all the measures that are needed to contain the spread of foot and mouth disease, to assist livestock farmers through the crisis, to maintain food supplies and to restore export markets.\" But Mr Brown snapped when Mr Yeo criticised the government for not setting aside time for a Commons debate on the crisis. Announcing that the Tories would hold the debate in their own time, Mr Yeo asked: \"Do you recognise that the heartbreaking prospect for many farmers today is not just the loss of their livelihood, but the destruction of their lives work? The risk of human tragedies under these circumstances is very real.\" Eric Pickles, Tory MP for Brentwood and Ongar where the outbreak was first identified, praised the \"sharp-eyed\" veterinary official who had spotted the disease and prevented an even worse disaster. But Mr Pickles criticised the government for failing to update its website on the crisis on a regular basis. Angela Smith, Labour MP for Basildon, rounded on \"irresponsible\" journalists who have walked across farms within exclusion zones. \"The best story for a farmer is that there are no new outbreaks and that all reporters should act with the utmost responsibility,\" she said. Mr Brown said that camera crews were buzzing over infected land in helicopters, possibly spreading the disease. Gordon Prentice, Labour MP for Pendle, said he could not understand how farmers could claim that they were not aware of the signs of the disease. He said that when he visited the government website to find out what a pig with the disease looked like he found that its snout became \"very, very strange indeed\". What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Scotland's largest media company SMG has reported a boost in profits on the back of its acquisition of Chris Evans's Ginger radio empire. The owner of the Grampian and Scottish ITV franchises has been busy in the radio sector over the past year. It is now in the middle of a takeover battle for national rival Scottish Radio Holdings. SMG said pre-tax profits for 2000 had risen 18% to \u00a359m, with turnover climbing 25% to \u00a3300.5m. \"We continued to expand, emerging as a significant player in UK media, touching the lives of millions of viewers, listeners and readers,\" said SMG chairman Don Cruickshank. Although television remains SMG's biggest earner, its also owns the Pearl &amp; Dean cinema advertising firm and the Herald and Sunday Herald newspapers. The Virgin Radio station it acquired through the Ginger deal contributed \u00a333m to the group's turnover. Mr Cruickshank added that there was no evidence of a downturn in the advertising market. However, he said that the slowdown in the US economy and the imminent general election were making advertisers cautious. \"Overall, our businesses are performing well in uncertain market conditions and the group is in good shape. \"If economic uncertainty abates and advertising prospects are confirmed then we will make good progress in the year ahead,\" added Mr Cruickshank. SMG said little about its courtship of Scottish Radio Holdings. But it pointed out that its 24% stake in the company put it in a prime position to take advantage of consolidation in the UK radio market.

To me especially, and I'm sure to the rest of the team, the penalty we conceded in the last minute of normal time felt like being stabbed. </p> <p>\"I made the tackle, and I think the referee was probably right in his decision. I was about four or five yards away from the Birmingham player when I went for the second ball in our 18-yard box. I thought he was going to shoot and I tried to block his attempt, but I got there too late and he went over. When the referee pointed to the spot I couldn't believe it because we were so close to winning the game. This just wasn't happening! </p> <p>\"Naturally I was hoping Darren Purse would miss, but deep down I knew that was unlikely and that we'd have to start our work all over again. I just had to forget what had gone before and try to concentrate on the next 30 minutes, which I knew were going to be very tough and in fact, Birmingham made it a real struggle for us.

I am very proud to have taken part in the win today that has shown our opponents that Liverpool are back, firing on all cylinders again! Let's hope it's not the last! \"We certainly are in a mood to party tonight. Along with my former Bayern Munchen teammates at Liverpool, I think we can show the Liverpool born lads how to have a good time. Germans may be considered boring and humourless but it is going to be an entertaining time tonight. \"We get good practise at the Munich beer festival (Oktoberfest) and tonight will be \"Rockfest!\" But although we deserve to have fun tonight, tomorrow we will be back training for our continued assault on the Premier League. We will make The Worthington Cup really Worth(ington) while!\" For more on Markus's Worthington Cup joy, click here. Stephane Henchoz: conceding a penalty 'felt like being stabbed' \"I still find it hard to describe exactly how I feel at having won the first medal of my career. To me especially, and I'm sure to the rest of the team, the penalty we conceded in the last minute of normal time felt like being stabbed. \"I made the tackle, and I think the referee was probably right in his decision. I was about four or five yards away from the Birmingham player when I went for the second ball in our 18-yard box. I thought he was going to shoot and I tried to block his attempt, but I got there too late and he went over. When the referee pointed to the spot I couldn't believe it because we were so close to winning the game. This just wasn't happening! \"Naturally I was hoping Darren Purse would miss, but deep down I knew that was unlikely and that we'd have to start our work all over again. I just had to forget what had gone before and try to concentrate on the next 30 minutes, which I knew were going to be very tough and in fact, Birmingham made it a real struggle for us. God, it was hard out there! However, it was a pleasure to play in the Millennium Stadium yesterday, which must be one of the finest venues around. And to win there made it even more special.\" Read more at Stephane Henchoz's homepage: click here.

The Bentegodi is Hellas Verona's stadium. The Brigate Gialloblu , our hardline fans, are in trouble again. The club has been fined 70m lire (\u00a322,800) for a prolonged chorus of racist monkey grunts. </p> <p>Here's a curious thing then: while American or German tourists explore the piazzas and palazzi of Verona in a daze of admiration, imagining themselves at the very heart of renaissance elegance and humanist civilisation, the rest of the country is dismissing the town as bigoted, workaholic and, above all, irretrievably racist. What's more, the Veronese always vote to the right and this is an election year. The knives are out. </p> <p>Back in October, Verona played their first home game of the season against Udinese, who were fielding their big Ghanaian defender, Gargo. Interviewed the day before the game, this immensely talented player, black as coal, shiny as granite, newly arrived in the bel paese , claimed that he was going to make the Italians love him; he was going to eliminate racism from Italian stadiums, he said, quite simply because people would admire and love him so much for the generous and gentlemanly and humble and dedicated way he played. Needless to say, a fair dose of narcissism is to be expected from the successful sportsman. Needless to say, at Verona's Bentegodi, Gargo was mercilessly barracked every time he touched the ball. \"Ooh-ooh-ooh,\" grunted the curva . The club was fined. </p> <p>Now it has happened again with Parma's French international Thuram. Verona crashed two-nil. The curva grunted ooh-ooh. Another big fine. After the game, the club's owner, Giambattista Pastorello, made an unhappy remark suggesting that it would be difficult for him to buy a black player because of the fans. For the whole week, talk shows nationwide could do nothing but condemn racism in Verona. Yet the odd thing is that Verona has one of the highest levels of black immigration and black employment in Italy and cases of violence toward immigrants are extremely rare and getting rarer. Only a stone's throw from the stadium, the city's circular road is thickly patrolled by black prostitutes and their pimps. They are not harassed. This isn't even London in the 70s, never mind Alabama. </p> <p>\"If I can shout vaffanculo at a Juventino, and terrone di merda at a Neapolitan,\" writes a fan on the club's internet chat line, \"why can't I shout ooh-ooh at Thuram? I only want to put him off.\" </p> <p>It's fascinating that there are people who really cannot see the difference between these insults. Another contributor writes: \"How the hell can they call me racist, Dio povero , I work next to a guy from Vicenza and even get on with him! Forget politics, let's play, fuck, eat and Forza magica Verona! \" </p> <p>But this is no time for joking. The Federcalcio has decided new rules for the second half of the season. As of February 11 racist chants will not just be fined; the stadium will be banned. </p> <p>\"The truth is,\" someone else writes into cyberspace, \"they don't want us to stop the monkey grunts. They love calling Verona racist. They want to close the Bentegodi. We lose home advantage and crash into Serie B.\" </p> <p>No one is more ready than the Italian to imagine a conspiracy. I've lived here long enough to share this guy's suspicions. We're being auditioned for scapegoat. </p> <p>The make or break game is against Bari. Last week we lost away at Perugia. That's three defeats in a row. We are in deep trouble, third from bottom. Four clubs go down. And now there's the threat of a stadium ban too. As we file up to be frisked inside the turnstiles, someone hands us a leaflet: \"CIVILISED VERONA SHOUTS: 'FORZA HELLAS', NO TO RACISM, NO TO THE DEMONISATION OF OUR TOWN.\" </p> <p>More nervous than ever, my son and I find a couple of seats. Once, when he was very young, I had to forbid him from joining in racist chants. Now he is their fiercest opponent. My own feeling about the chants, though, is that in a curious way they have served a purpose. They doubtless gave voice to a certain intolerance to immigration that many people felt. At the same time, precisely by expressing it, they made most people realise that such behaviour wasn't on, that it is unacceptable to taunt a man because he is black. If an immigrant is attacked at night in a side street, there is little public shame and real damage. But when intolerance is amplified in the huge theatre of the stadium, everyone is involved, even if no one is physically hurt. We know there's a problem; we feel it's our business. </p> <p>So what's going to happen today? Bari are bottom of the table. They are even more desperate than we are. And they're fielding two black players. Out they come on to the pitch. Both teams are wearing yellow tops that say: Blood has no colour. Red rag to a bull for the hooligans, I fear. The ritual photos are taken. The curva puts on its usual fantastic display of white confetti, blue and yellow smoke bombs. The politically correct tops come off. The whistle blows. The singing swells, \"Gialloblu la mia unica fede\" , yellow-blue my only faith. And then the Nigerian Enynnaya touches the ball. </p> <p>But here we have to stop a moment and look at that new regulation again. For the distinguishing feature of all Italian regulations is that they are complicated. They are complicated in order to be lenient, to provide endless scope for defence and discussion. If the racist chants are uncontested, the regulation says, then the club will be responsible, the stadium banned. But if the chants are contested and covered by \"normal\" fans, then there is no penalty. How interesting! </p> <p>Enynnaya carries the ball a few yards. The diehards begin their ooh-ooh's. More than racism, one suspects a delirium of transgression. Immediately, the rest of the curva begins to whistle. The ooh's are covered. </p> <p>As soon as the fans have discovered this new game, it happens every time the Nigerian touches the ball. Ooh-ooh, whistle whistle. Deafening. Since all the noise comes from the heart of the curva , not the rest of the stadium, one begins to suspect a jolly complicity between the two groups, a massive irony at the expense of good society: they are having their cake and eating it. It's theatre. Then the referee gives Bari a penalty. Our goalkeeper has pulled down Osmanovski. The keeper is sent off. The Russian scores from the spot. Verona go into the dressing room one-nil down. All the people around me, friends of old now, are disgusted. There is only one hope: bring on lo zingaro . </p> <p> Lo zingaro , the Gypsy, is Mutu, the Romanian star who gave Neville hell in the European championships. He often seems lazy and capricious, but the guy can occasionally make the difference. Just 10 minutes into the second half he fights off a storm of shoves and kicks then sends the keeper the wrong way to boot. Rete! Goal! </p> <p>And at that moment the curva discovers that to yell Mutu, Moo-too, sounds almost exactly like yelling ooh-ooh. It doesn't even need to be covered by whistles. They are still going at it in a triumph of mockery when, five minutes later, the Romanian disturbs Bari's keeper to set up Mauro Camoranesi (Argentinian, Italian passport) to tap in the second. What a mixed up world it is! </p> <p>Enynnaya is substituted in an absolute gale of whistles. Mutu is celebrated again as he miraculously sneaks in Verona's third. Moo-too! And in the dying moments the Egyptian Said gets one back for Bari and becomes the first Arab ever to score in Italy's Serie A. What a day for racial tolerance!

Those arrested are all members of Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), or the Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet, a feared extremist group which has been responsible for the murders of hundreds of Shia Muslims. Most of Pakistan's 140m people are Sunni Muslims, but Shias make up a significant 20% minority. Violent sectarian clashes between extremists from the two groups have become more frequent in recent months. Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, an SSP member, was convicted of murdering Sadiq Sanji, the director of the Iranian cultural centre, in Lahore in December 1990. Jhangvi, who is being held in a jail in Mianwali, in Punjab province, lost his final appeal earlier this year and is sentenced to hang at dawn on Wednesday. Police are now patrolling around the jail in armoured personnel carriers and the local government has banned any demonstrations or large gatherings. Leaders of the extremist group have gone into hiding but have warned they will protest against the execution. \"We will agitate if the execution is not stopped,\" said Maulana Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Inqalabi, a spokesman for SSP. \"These detentions are an attempt to sabotage peace and create anarchy.\" The group has strong connections with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, who, like SSP members, studied in religious schools in Pakistan. In 1998, at the time of another police crackdown, SSP leaders fled to Kabul for protection. Many SSP militants have trained at camps in Khost, in southern Afghanistan, run by the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden. The camps were targeted by a US missile strike in 1998 in response to the bombings of two US embassies in East Africa in which 224 people were killed. Bin Laden has been charged with masterminding the bombings. Police have said the arrests followed several sectarian killings in recent weeks but the interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, is clearly trying to clean up Pakistan's reputation for violence. Earlier this month he banned fund raising by militant groups fighting against the Indian army in Kashmir. He has also promised to tackle sectarian violence. \"Over the years many people have been killed in the name of sects and we cannot allow this to continue,\" Gen Haider said this week. In a rare visit to Afghanistan this month, Gen Haider presented a list of names of at least 60 Pakistanis wanted for sectarian attacks who were believed to be hiding in Afghanistan.

The BBC1 show drew 5.2m viewers and a 21% audience share, while ITV opposition Coronation Street pulled in a whopping 14.1m, according to unofficial overnights. But BBC1 schedulers will have been pleased the first instalment of Kenyon Confronts, in which journalist Paul Kenyon investigated the illegal trade in bogus marriages to evade immigration laws, was the best performing show in the 7.30pm slot against ITV's flagship soap so far this year. In seven previous outings at that time, Watchdog Healthcheck has averaged 4.6m viewers and an 18% audience share. Elsewhere last night new BBC2 sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, scripted by newcomer Susan Nickson, opened promisingly in the channel's new Monday Comedy Night line-up from 9.30pm. Two Pints took 2.8m and an 11% share against Channel 4 documentary Nazi Women, which attracted 2.2m. In the closely fought Monday night 8.30pm slot, ITV's New You've Been Framed got the better of The Weakest Link on BBC1. New You've Been Framed had 8.5m and a 33% share, compared with 7.8m for Anne Robinson-hosted quiz show. The Weakest Link had won the slot on the previous two Mondays. From 9.10pm on BBC1 cop drama In Deep, starring Nick Berry and Stephen Tompkinson as undercover police officers, slipped back against Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? compared with its debut last week. The first instalment of another In Deep two-parter had 6.8m, after the series opened with 7.4m last Monday. From 10.35pm BBC1's 90-minute film Bafta highlights - the awards ceremony was broadcast live on Sky One on Sunday night - had 2.9m and a 25% share.",

      "standfirst": "Sir Neville Cardus, \"Cricketer\" on the Manchester Guardian from the 1920s, wrote these reflections on Bradman's career in the early 1960s. Sir Neville remained the Guardian's chief music critic, and an occasional contributor on cricket, until his death in 1975.",
      "trailText": "<p>At Adelaide, at close of play on a hot day on which Donald Bradman amassed 212, I asked Bill Voce, the Nottinghamshire and England fast left-handed bowler: \"What's the best ball to bowl at 'the Don'?\" Out of his heart, Bill replied: \"There's no ruddy best ball to bowl at him.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>At Adelaide, at close of play on a hot day on which Donald Bradman amassed 212, I asked Bill Voce, the Nottinghamshire and England fast left-handed bowler: \"What's the best ball to bowl at 'the Don'?\" Out of his heart, Bill replied: \"There's no ruddy best ball to bowl at him.\" </p> <p>Bradman scored a century on his first appearance in first-class cricket. One of the opposing bowlers, a famous Australian captain, was asked after his baptism of Bradman: \"What's this new young cove like?\" \"He belts hell out of everything he can reach,\" was the reply, which, I think, can be taken as the most eloquent of all ways of describing Bradman's batting. He was a killer of all kind of bowling, given a good pitch to play on. </p> <p>A splendid South African bowler told me that, at Adelaide, Bradman hit him for three fours in one of his first overs, the ball still new. His captain thereupon asked: \"What's the matter?\" The bowler answered: \"Well, if you really want to know, he's just hit for hellfire fours three of the best balls I've ever bowled in my life.\" </p> <p>It is a familiar and banal criticism of Bradman that he was mechanical, an adding machine. True, he was not a conventional stylist, all curves and ornamental. But it was exciting to watch, exacting to nerves and imagination to see him gather his energy at the last second and square up to a rising fast ball, then hook it to the boundary with a crack, dispersing the pigeons. </p> <p>Against the terrifically fast leg-side attack of Larwood, in the Australian rubber of 1932-33, he hit fours to the offside, where the field was more or less uncovered. Larwood had six men at least on the on-side, so Bradman leapt to that side, and actually drove or cut to the off. Larwood expressed his admiration of this daring counter-attack. \"Marvellous. He played tennis strokes at me.\" </p> <p>Like all great batsmen, Bradman made his strokes very late. He didn't move at all, after he had taken his stance, until the ball was on him. Then, by sudden and superbly concentrated dynamics, the brilliant technique shot forth its devastation. He made strokes which you would swear were entirely his own, not copybook strokes, not strokes out of cricket's gospel, but governed by his instinctive logic. </p> <p>Few batsmen have equalled Bradman's ability to hit from the bat's middle. If the bat seemed to come to the line of the ball not straight, it was so timed and guided that, at the moment of contact, the willow's strong centre was the propelling point. Even if he edged a ball, as at the beginning of an innings he might (once in a blue moon), he would use the edge's centre. </p> <p>He wasted no energy. After he had demolished Larwood, Geary, Tate and Richard Tyldesley at Headingley in 1930 (304 not out in a day), he came from the field cool and neat, as though fresh from the bathroom. I asked Dick Tyldesley that evening to give me his opinion of Bradman. His answer was honest and final: \"'E's no ruddy use to me.\" </p> <p>In the 1930 England v Australia rubber, Bradman's first tour of England, he scored 8, 131, 254, 1, 334, 14 and 232. In 1934, again at Headingley, he scored 304. The Australian innings on this occasion began badly, 39 for three at close of play on the first day. That evening, Bradman went to bed early, saying that tomorrow he'd need to get 200 at least. I reminded him that, in his last Test innings at Leeds, he had scored 334. \"The law of averages,\" I said, \"is against your pulling off another vast score tomorrow.\" \"I don't believe in any law of averages,\" he gently retorted. </p> <p> It is argued that Bradman seldom mastered a sticky wicket. But Hedley Verity, a great left-handed spinner on a sticky wicket, assured me that, \"if he had tried\", the Don could have coped in any circumstances.

      "bodyText": "At Adelaide, at close of play on a hot day on which Donald Bradman amassed 212, I asked Bill Voce, the Nottinghamshire and England fast left-handed bowler: \"What's the best ball to bowl at 'the Don'?\" Out of his heart, Bill replied: \"There's no ruddy best ball to bowl at him.\" Bradman scored a century on his first appearance in first-class cricket. One of the opposing bowlers, a famous Australian captain, was asked after his baptism of Bradman: \"What's this new young cove like?\" \"He belts hell out of everything he can reach,\" was the reply, which, I think, can be taken as the most eloquent of all ways of describing Bradman's batting. He was a killer of all kind of bowling, given a good pitch to play on. A splendid South African bowler told me that, at Adelaide, Bradman hit him for three fours in one of his first overs, the ball still new. His captain thereupon asked: \"What's the matter?\" The bowler answered: \"Well, if you really want to know, he's just hit for hellfire fours three of the best balls I've ever bowled in my life.\" It is a familiar and banal criticism of Bradman that he was mechanical, an adding machine. True, he was not a conventional stylist, all curves and ornamental. But it was exciting to watch, exacting to nerves and imagination to see him gather his energy at the last second and square up to a rising fast ball, then hook it to the boundary with a crack, dispersing the pigeons. Against the terrifically fast leg-side attack of Larwood, in the Australian rubber of 1932-33, he hit fours to the offside, where the field was more or less uncovered. Larwood had six men at least on the on-side, so Bradman leapt to that side, and actually drove or cut to the off. Larwood expressed his admiration of this daring counter-attack. \"Marvellous. He played tennis strokes at me.\" Like all great batsmen, Bradman made his strokes very late. He didn't move at all, after he had taken his stance, until the ball was on him. Then, by sudden and superbly concentrated dynamics, the brilliant technique shot forth its devastation. He made strokes which you would swear were entirely his own, not copybook strokes, not strokes out of cricket's gospel, but governed by his instinctive logic. Few batsmen have equalled Bradman's ability to hit from the bat's middle. If the bat seemed to come to the line of the ball not straight, it was so timed and guided that, at the moment of contact, the willow's strong centre was the propelling point. Even if he edged a ball, as at the beginning of an innings he might (once in a blue moon), he would use the edge's centre. He wasted no energy. After he had demolished Larwood, Geary, Tate and Richard Tyldesley at Headingley in 1930 (304 not out in a day), he came from the field cool and neat, as though fresh from the bathroom. I asked Dick Tyldesley that evening to give me his opinion of Bradman. His answer was honest and final: \"'E's no ruddy use to me.\" In the 1930 England v Australia rubber, Bradman's first tour of England, he scored 8, 131, 254, 1, 334, 14 and 232. In 1934, again at Headingley, he scored 304. The Australian innings on this occasion began badly, 39 for three at close of play on the first day. That evening, Bradman went to bed early, saying that tomorrow he'd need to get 200 at least. I reminded him that, in his last Test innings at Leeds, he had scored 334. \"The law of averages,\" I said, \"is against your pulling off another vast score tomorrow.\" \"I don't believe in any law of averages,\" he gently retorted. It is argued that Bradman seldom mastered a sticky wicket. But Hedley Verity, a great left-handed spinner on a sticky wicket, assured me that, \"if he had tried\", the Don could have coped in any circumstances. True, at Lord's in 1934 he made no obvious effort to play Verity with any patience on a turning pitch. Bradman held obtuse views about sticky wickets, arguing that they reduced science and skill to nonsense. Certainly the wickets in Australia in Bradman's time would change from billiard tables to rearing and spinning terrors, after rain and sun. It wasn't fair for a team to be trapped this way, having bowled the day before on a smooth, fast, grassless, batsmen's paradise.

      "body": "<p>With its penchant for remakes, franchises and bankrupt, perfunctory sequels (did someone say Hannibal?), Hollywood has never been big on surprises. So it will come as no surprise to learn that - in the wake of last year's smash hit X-Men - there are plans to make at least three more movies devoted to comic- book superheroes. </p> <p>This time, however, things may turn out rather smarter than usual, thanks to the nature of those charged with undertaking the projects. Each is a maverick talent, and each has been drawn to tales of genetically modified derring-do. Sam Raimi, one-time poster-boy of cult-horror fans, is already preparing a version of Spider-Man, due for release next year. The Hulk, shorn of his \"Incredible\" prefix but still deeply crabby, looks likely to be brought to the screen by Ang Lee, the master craftsman behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And the moribund Batman series is set to be revived by Brooklyn wunderkind Darren Aronofsky, director of the harrowing Requiem For a Dream. </p> <p>Implausible? Nostalgia is partly to blame. Raimi, Lee and Aronofsky were all marked by the last great comic-adaptation boom (1978 to 1983) which saw the definitive Superman and its two sequels; the spin-off Supergirl, and a rash of tributes to, among others, Captain America and the still-Incredible Hulk. </p> <p>Back then, however, the directors behind comic-book movies were quite different, with the hipsters of the day (Martin Scorsese, John Cassavetes, Michael Cimino) playing no part.

      "bodyText": "With its penchant for remakes, franchises and bankrupt, perfunctory sequels (did someone say Hannibal?), Hollywood has never been big on surprises. So it will come as no surprise to learn that - in the wake of last year's smash hit X-Men - there are plans to make at least three more movies devoted to comic- book superheroes. This time, however, things may turn out rather smarter than usual, thanks to the nature of those charged with undertaking the projects. Each is a maverick talent, and each has been drawn to tales of genetically modified derring-do. Sam Raimi, one-time poster-boy of cult-horror fans, is already preparing a version of Spider-Man, due for release next year. The Hulk, shorn of his \"Incredible\" prefix but still deeply crabby, looks likely to be brought to the screen by Ang Lee, the master craftsman behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And the moribund Batman series is set to be revived by Brooklyn wunderkind Darren Aronofsky, director of the harrowing Requiem For a Dream. Implausible? Nostalgia is partly to blame.

      "body": "<p>The impossibly tangled web which Ministry of Agriculture staff began to unravel last week now extends across three animal species, five countries and many British counties as foot and mouth disease carried by British sheep threatens to spread though Europe and even further afield.</p> <p>But as mainland Europe continued yesterday to try to identify and quarantine or kill those animals which they suspect may have come into contact with infected British sheep, it was becoming clear that the continental meat trade is so complex that a sheep born in Aberdeenshire could be trucked 1,600 miles before being slaughtered as far away as Beirut.</p> <p>The detective story starts, for the moment, when 40 sheep were sent from Ian Williamson's Prestwick Hall farm at Ponteland near Newcastle airport to Hexham market on February 13. It is known that more than 3,500 animals were sold that day and all the buyers and sellers have to be traced and their animals monitored. The ministry hopes to complete tracing them in the next 24 hours.</p> <p>More than a week later, foot and mouth disease was confirmed among cattle at Prestwick Hall farm shortly after Burnside farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall - barely four miles away - was pinpointed by the Ministry of Agriculture as the likely source of the national outbreak. Vets believe the virus was carried from infected pigs by wind to Prestwick Hall farm, and then to a neighbouring farm at Westerhope, near Newcastle - confirmed yesterday as the 10th outbreak.</p> <p>They believe that the 40 sheep from Prestwick were sold to Willy Cleave, a Devon dealer who has 11 farms in the west country where he keeps sheep before sending them on to British abattoirs or for export. The 40 were then shipped on February 15 to Longtown market, Carlisle, which is one of the largest sheep markets in Europe and also acts as a holding centre. However the ministry still does not know for certain whether these sheep were the infected ones.</p> <p>What is known is that the Longtown 40 were collected shortly afterwards and taken to Mr Cleave's Highampton farm in Devon. Cattle there developed foot and mouth but it was not known at the time they had caught it from sheep.</p> <p>On February 21, some sheep from Highampton were trucked to Bromham slaughterhouse in Wiltshire, where they developed foot and mouth. The next day sheep from the same farm were sent to Northampton and sold at the local auction. Normally, about 85% of the 1,500 sheep sold that day would go for export but because the export route had been closed on February 17, these sheep would have been held by dealers. All are now being traced.</p> <p>Separately Mr Cleave had, on February 12, trucked 348 sheep from Devon to Germany via Dover on the Cap Afrique, Britain's only dedicated livestock export ferry. Since then according to the ministry, he had sold other batches of sheep to British dealers intended for export. All these are also being searched for.</p> <p>The last sheep exports from Britain to the continent were at 2am on February 17. The Cap Afrique left Dover loaded with hundreds of animals bound for Dunkirk. Farmer's Ferry, the company which owns it, said it had exported about 30,000 sheepin the two weeks before the ban. The ministry is having to trace all sheep exported on the Cap Afrique in the past three weeks.</p> <p>Yesterday, the German authorities traced the 348 sheep sent directly by Mr Cleave to Germany on February 12 and killed them as a precautionary measure.</p> <p>The Cap Afrique suspended all operations within hours of the first confirmed outbreak, but the European authorities say it may have been too late to prevent the disease spreading through Europe.</p> <p>After long journeys from as far away as Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the west country, animals are known to be highly susceptible to disease. If any of those exported in the past few weeks had already been infected, they could easily have passed it on.</p> <p>Most live sheep exported from Britain are taken first to any one of more than 60 EU registered \"holding stations\" where they are kept, often with many thousands of other animals, for up to several days. British exporters favour a handful of large stations in Belgium and Holland.</p> <p>However, according to Gilles Frojet of the major French holding station La Gatevini\u00e8re at Argenton L'Eglise, there are many unofficial holding stations in mainland Europe which could also have received infected animals and could possibly duck the authorities' investigations.</p> <p>Tracing livestock movements in Europe is difficult, said Mike Gooding of Farmers First, a British sheep exporter. British animals have full documentation, but many animals in continental holding centres are resold in job lots to buyers who quite legally alter their papers of origin.</p> <p>\"They are all mixed up which adds to the potential for disease and many are bought and sold,\" said Mr Gooding.</p> <p>From these staging posts and markets, sheep go all over the continent and many are re-exported with Dutch, French or Belgian papers 1,000 miles or more to abattoirs in Italy, Greece and Spain.

      "bodyText": "The impossibly tangled web which Ministry of Agriculture staff began to unravel last week now extends across three animal species, five countries and many British counties as foot and mouth disease carried by British sheep threatens to spread though Europe and even further afield. But as mainland Europe continued yesterday to try to identify and quarantine or kill those animals which they suspect may have come into contact with infected British sheep, it was becoming clear that the continental meat trade is so complex that a sheep born in Aberdeenshire could be trucked 1,600 miles before being slaughtered as far away as Beirut. The detective story starts, for the moment, when 40 sheep were sent from Ian Williamson's Prestwick Hall farm at Ponteland near Newcastle airport to Hexham market on February 13. It is known that more than 3,500 animals were sold that day and all the buyers and sellers have to be traced and their animals monitored. The ministry hopes to complete tracing them in the next 24 hours. More than a week later, foot and mouth disease was confirmed among cattle at Prestwick Hall farm shortly after Burnside farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall - barely four miles away - was pinpointed by the Ministry of Agriculture as the likely source of the national outbreak. Vets believe the virus was carried from infected pigs by wind to Prestwick Hall farm, and then to a neighbouring farm at Westerhope, near Newcastle - confirmed yesterday as the 10th outbreak. They believe that the 40 sheep from Prestwick were sold to Willy Cleave, a Devon dealer who has 11 farms in the west country where he keeps sheep before sending them on to British abattoirs or for export. The 40 were then shipped on February 15 to Longtown market, Carlisle, which is one of the largest sheep markets in Europe and also acts as a holding centre. However the ministry still does not know for certain whether these sheep were the infected ones. What is known is that the Longtown 40 were collected shortly afterwards and taken to Mr Cleave's Highampton farm in Devon. Cattle there developed foot and mouth but it was not known at the time they had caught it from sheep. On February 21, some sheep from Highampton were trucked to Bromham slaughterhouse in Wiltshire, where they developed foot and mouth. The next day sheep from the same farm were sent to Northampton and sold at the local auction. Normally, about 85% of the 1,500 sheep sold that day would go for export but because the export route had been closed on February 17, these sheep would have been held by dealers. All are now being traced. Separately Mr Cleave had, on February 12, trucked 348 sheep from Devon to Germany via Dover on the Cap Afrique, Britain's only dedicated livestock export ferry. Since then according to the ministry, he had sold other batches of sheep to British dealers intended for export. All these are also being searched for. The last sheep exports from Britain to the continent were at 2am on February 17. The Cap Afrique left Dover loaded with hundreds of animals bound for Dunkirk. Farmer's Ferry, the company which owns it, said it had exported about 30,000 sheepin the two weeks before the ban. The ministry is having to trace all sheep exported on the Cap Afrique in the past three weeks. Yesterday, the German authorities traced the 348 sheep sent directly by Mr Cleave to Germany on February 12 and killed them as a precautionary measure. The Cap Afrique suspended all operations within hours of the first confirmed outbreak, but the European authorities say it may have been too late to prevent the disease spreading through Europe. After long journeys from as far away as Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the west country, animals are known to be highly susceptible to disease. If any of those exported in the past few weeks had already been infected, they could easily have passed it on. Most live sheep exported from Britain are taken first to any one of more than 60 EU registered \"holding stations\" where they are kept, often with many thousands of other animals, for up to several days. British exporters favour a handful of large stations in Belgium and Holland. However, according to Gilles Frojet of the major French holding station La Gatevini\u00e8re at Argenton L'Eglise, there are many unofficial holding stations in mainland Europe which could also have received infected animals and could possibly duck the authorities' investigations. Tracing livestock movements in Europe is difficult, said Mike Gooding of Farmers First, a British sheep exporter. British animals have full documentation, but many animals in continental holding centres are resold in job lots to buyers who quite legally alter their papers of origin. \"They are all mixed up which adds to the potential for disease and many are bought and sold,\" said Mr Gooding. From these staging posts and markets, sheep go all over the continent and many are re-exported with Dutch, French or Belgian papers 1,000 miles or more to abattoirs in Italy, Greece and Spain. Hundreds of thousands of animals are then re-exported outside Europe, especially to the Middle East and North Africa via Italian ports. Yesterday, the Dutch slaughtered 4,300 animals on 11 farms. The French farm ministry said that up to 47,000 sheep recently imported from Britain had been identified but it had not decided whether to kill them. German officials announced a programme of slaughter for thousands of livestock.

I drove a top-of-the-range Initiale, fitted with interesting off-white leather which may have found favour with Peter Stringfellow and/or the Milky Bar Kid. It had a terrifyingly swift V6 engine and, luckily, some very crisp brakes. It was also passionately, but kindly, concerned about my driving.

      "bodyText": "Compared with the Grammy Awards, which proved that rock warhorses were still alive by handing Steely Dan a best album statuette at last week's ceremony, the Brits should have been a relative oasis of coolness. An overhaul of voting procedures in the early 90s meant that the days when Phil Collins and Annie Lennox won everything in sight are gone, and hipper and younger artists now reign. Even so, the 1,000-strong music industry voting panel appears to have forgotten the lesson of the Collins era, which is that rewarding the same acts every year while overlooking newer talent makes the acts complacent and the industry seem out of touch. Robbie Williams, who took home three trophies last night, already has a mantelpiece groaning with the things - his total of 12 makes him the most prolific winner in Brits history - and clearly does not need any more, especially for the workaday song which won it, Rock DJ. We can only ascribe Fatboy Slim's latest triumph with the underwhelming Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars album to the fact that, a white male in his late 30s with a taste for loud shirts, he resembles the typical Brits panellist. Where were the industry bigwigs when 19-year-old Craig David (right) became the most acclaimed British singer of last year, selling 1.5m copies of his debut album and teaching even over-30s to associate the word \"garage\" with dance music rather than cars? He lost to Williams in three categories, to Fatboy Slim for dance act, young fogeys Coldplay for album - at least it was not the inexplicably-nominated 70s revivalists Toploader - and, most shamefully of all, the boy band A1 for newcomer. That gong was voted for by Radio 1 listeners, who plumped for the vapid A1 despite the station not playlisting their two number-one singles. In view of this conservatism, it seems odd to see Eminem as the best international male, but perhaps it is acceptable to go for the controversial choice as long as he lives in Detroit and will not be a fixture on Saturday morning TV.

Other performers providing the soundtrack to the event included Westlife, who won best pop act; and Sonique, who took the award for best British female solo artist.

      "bodyText": "The direct marketing industry trade body has held merger talks with a new mobile marketing organisation in a bid to stop text messaging becoming a nuisance. As \"brand in your hand\" marketing on mobile phones begins to take off, the Direct Marketing Association has held extensive negotiations with the newly established Wireless Marketing Association over a proposition to merge the two groups. The move cements the view that wireless marketing is a becoming a serious contender for advertisers' direct marketing budgets. The DMA already has an observer's seat on the WMA board. But it is believed the new organisation would prefer to go it alone rather than merge with the existing body, at least for the time being. However, some formal link between the two bodies is likely. The WMA wants to establish an up-to-the-minute database of consumers, who want to opt in or out of mobile marketing initiatives. This database could be shared with the DMA. The WMA was formed in October by mobile marketing services companies. It is an attempt to form self-regulatory rules to govern the use, and potential abuse, of mobile-phone marketing. The body last week published a wireless marketing code of conduct in agreement with three of the country's four network operators - Orange, Vodafone and BT Cellnet. Even the Labour party contacted the WMA last week to check its new text messaging campaign abided by the rules. The WMA has also appointed Edinburgh agency Summerstreet to create a \"kitemark\"-style stamp of approval logo for the body. Members of the organisation will be able to use the logo in their own communications. The agency is also working on a new website for the WMA.

      "body": "<p>One of the government's main weapons for tackling child poverty is backfiring against many of Britain's most needy working parents, according to an analysis of casework by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. </p> <p>It found workers were being sacked by firms trying to avoid the trouble of administering the working families tax credit, a government scheme to top up the incomes of low-paid parents. </p> <p>In other cases parents felt \"cheated and misled\" when they found the extra income from the tax credit disqualified them from free school meals and help with rent and council tax. </p> <p>The tax credit was introduced in October 1999 \"to give working families with children a better deal\".

      "bodyText": "One of the government's main weapons for tackling child poverty is backfiring against many of Britain's most needy working parents, according to an analysis of casework by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It found workers were being sacked by firms trying to avoid the trouble of administering the working families tax credit, a government scheme to top up the incomes of low-paid parents. In other cases parents felt \"cheated and misled\" when they found the extra income from the tax credit disqualified them from free school meals and help with rent and council tax. The tax credit was introduced in October 1999 \"to give working families with children a better deal\". Together with the national minimum wage, it was designed to ensure that a two-parent family gets an income of more than \u00a3200 a week if one parent is working for at least 30 hours. David Harker, NACAB chief executive, said the credit gave \"a real boost to the incomes of many low-paid parents\". He added: \"But it makes no sense that a scheme that sets out to make work pay is making it more difficult for some people to stay in their jobs, and leaving some families worse instead of better off.\" A survey of 700 case reports from advice bureaux throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed employers pressuring staff to reduce their hours so they do not qualify for the tax credit. \"Some employers consider the administrative burden too great for them to manage. In a small number of cases, people have been sacked just for claiming tax credits,\" NACAB said. It said a lone mother with three children was dismissed from her part-time job because her employer \"could not cope\" when the scheme changed from direct payments to delivery of the credit through the pay packet. Other lone mothers had to give up work because \"excessively rigid rules\" made it difficult to take advantage of help with childcare costs. Advice bureaux reported women reconsidering their decision to work and returning to life on benefits when they found their extra earnings were cancelled out by loss of help with rent, council tax and school meals. Mr Harker said: \"Our evidence shows overwhelmingly that people want to work and support their families even when they are no better off in work than on benefit.

There she was, hoping to hand in her notice as leader of the House of Lords and minister for women and tiptoe out of the back door with as little fuss as possible - and then those nasty busybodies at the Equal Opportunities Commission complete a survey trumpeting the failure of her women's unit. To be fair, the findings, published today, are as much an indictment of New Labour as they are of the unit it created to look after women's interests: in terms of equal pay and equal opportunities, Britain is the most sexist place to work in Europe. </p> <p>Red faces all around. The party that had raised such hopes and manufactured such hype about its pro-women agenda - remember all the boasts about more female MPs than ever before? The ground-breaking, breastfeeding Blair babes? - will now enter the general election with a set of statistics that will further alienate female voters, a million of whom say they've gone off the government. </p> <p>The picture is bleak indeed. If you care about how your wage packet compares with the man who does the same job as you, you're better off in France, Germany or even Portugal. The wage gap in these countries is less than in Britain - where a woman working full time earns just 82% of her male colleague's salary. (For a part-time female worker that sinks to 60%.) If you care about paid maternity leave, you'd better up sticks and move to Italy (where a mother gets five months' paid leave) or Finland (nine months, as well as 42 days for paternity leave); in Britain, you get a paltry 18 weeks. Add to this poor childcare provision and, in predominantly female professions such as nursing, an average pay of 6% less than overall average male earnings in the UK, and you can see why the European Council of Ministers told the UK to get down to work on closing the pay gap. </p> <p>They have their work cut out for them. Thirty years since the Equal Pay Act was passed, women find the workplace as inimical as the factory caricatured in Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. Talk to staff at the EOC, and they can name endless cases of women who have had to take their employers to court to receive fair treatment. Take Dr Lorna Chessum, a female lecturer at Leicester's De Montfort University, who discovered she had been appointed on a lower salary - \u00a36,000 less - than a similarly qualified male colleague. She received \u00a310,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement in September 2000. </p> <p>Then there's Doreen McManus, who worked as a payroll administrator for Rentokil. She claimed that over three years she did the same work as a male colleague, whom she trained, and who was paid \u00a33,000 more than her. She took the matter up with her employer, who agreed to review her pay. Her salary was increased - but she was still earning less than her colleague. She lodged an equal pay claim and Rentokil settled the case, paying her \u00a310,500 compensation. </p> <p>Two small victories in a war we thought was won long ago. A war in which we cannot count on either government or employer as an ally. Jill Rubery, as the coordinator of the European Commission's expert group on gender and equality, was present when the commission, having seen the UK's National Action Plan for Employment last year, publicly reprimanded the country for its appalling employment figures. \"Immediately, our civil servants started to rubbish the data as insufficient and emphasise the high employment rate we have for women - which is well above the 60% target by 2010 set in Lisbon in 1999.\" The spin machine is likely to go into overdrive after the EOC survey, too, despite its impressive credentials: the research was carried out by the NOP group in the summer last year. It involved a telephone survey of senior human resource managers in 301 organisations with at least 200 employees; telephone interviews with national trade union officials; and in-depth case-study research in 21 selected organisations. </p> <p>While government apologists may spin against the EOC survey for painting too gloomy a picture of the working woman's lot, critics of the government suspect that the survey in fact lets the government off lightly. Mary Davis, who heads the Centre for Trade Union Studies at the University of North London, argues: \"Industry by industry, the gender pay gap has actually widened since 1997. I see no evidence, apart from the introduction of the national minimum wage, to support the view that we are wit nessing a narrowing of the gap. Among working-class women, certainly, things have got worse. If you're living in a textile town, for instance, with the industry bottoming out beneath your feet, you are far poorer than before.\" </p> <p>Rubery, who with Damian Grimshaw carried out the research for the EOC, feels that even some of the state's poverty-busting initiatives have had a negative impact on women's wages. The working families tax credit, for example, \"contradicted the equal-pay ethos by trapping the second income-earner in a low- paying job\". Moreover, as both Davis and Rubery point out, a government that believes that any regulation hinders the market, and has abdicated all responsibility for pay structure, cannot intervene in the one area that most affects the gender pay gap. </p> <p>The market, indeed, has become a fig leaf behind which employers can hide discrimination: you can get away with paying Jane less than Joe by signing them up to individualised contracts.

Equally, there are many ways of explaining away why promotion keeps eluding her. </p> <p>The trade unions, once the battering rams for victims of unfair treatment at work, have lost their bite. Collective bargaining has declined in recent years; today, less than one in three workplaces is covered by it. Meanwhile, employer accountability has grown ever more nebulous. In an increasing number of situations, there is no single, clear-cut employer - as is the case when work is subcontracted, or joint ventures or partnerships operate. This makes it difficult to uphold legislationbased on \"comparable work for the same employer\". The fragmentation of the public sector, through the contracting out of services to the private sector, also contributes to the difficulty in monitoring the wage differential.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair last night closed ranks with John Prescott and Gordon Brown in their determination to force the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and his transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, to \"knuckle down\" and work within the government's \u00a315bn blueprint for modernising the Underground system. </p> <p>In a high-stakes battle it raised the prospect that Mr Kiley might make good his veiled threat to resign his \u00a3250,000-a-year post - a move that Labour MPs fear may cost London marginals. </p> <p>With both sides talking tough over who will run the Underground, Mr Blair called in his two chief lieutenants for what was billed as a \"knocking-heads-together session\". </p> <p>Board members of Transport for London (TfL) reported Mr Kiley as \"white hot with anger\" at government obduracy. One member warned: \"I am concerned that he may do something stupid, like resigning. That would be a major blow. The people of London would certainly react against the government if he were forced out. The Treasury has to loosen its grip, or there will be all sorts of problems.\" </p> <p>On Sunday Mr Kiley, veteran of similar battles in New York and Boston, used an interview with BBC1's Breakfast with Frost to hint that the chancellor, Mr Brown, was the \"Wizard of Oz\" behind the scenes - stopping Mr Prescott from giving Mr Kiley \"unified management control\". </p> <p>In a 17-page document seen by Mr Blair yesterday, Mr Kiley used the same phrase, to the annoyance of ministers who complained that 16 pages attacked their plan and only one provided \"10 bullet points\" as an alternative. Both Downing Street and the Treasury were dismissive last night, though Mr Prescott's office was more cautious.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night closed ranks with John Prescott and Gordon Brown in their determination to force the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and his transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, to \"knuckle down\" and work within the government's \u00a315bn blueprint for modernising the Underground system. In a high-stakes battle it raised the prospect that Mr Kiley might make good his veiled threat to resign his \u00a3250,000-a-year post - a move that Labour MPs fear may cost London marginals. With both sides talking tough over who will run the Underground, Mr Blair called in his two chief lieutenants for what was billed as a \"knocking-heads-together session\". Board members of Transport for London (TfL) reported Mr Kiley as \"white hot with anger\" at government obduracy. One member warned: \"I am concerned that he may do something stupid, like resigning. That would be a major blow. The people of London would certainly react against the government if he were forced out. The Treasury has to loosen its grip, or there will be all sorts of problems.\" On Sunday Mr Kiley, veteran of similar battles in New York and Boston, used an interview with BBC1's Breakfast with Frost to hint that the chancellor, Mr Brown, was the \"Wizard of Oz\" behind the scenes - stopping Mr Prescott from giving Mr Kiley \"unified management control\". In a 17-page document seen by Mr Blair yesterday, Mr Kiley used the same phrase, to the annoyance of ministers who complained that 16 pages attacked their plan and only one provided \"10 bullet points\" as an alternative. Both Downing Street and the Treasury were dismissive last night, though Mr Prescott's office was more cautious. The mayor is calling a TfL board meeting for Thursday to draw up that alternative if talks remain deadlocked. \"We have gone a long way to offer [Mr Kiley] a real measure of control,\" said one high-level government source. \"There is actually a way through, but he needs to knuckle down and engage - the 10 points he put out were really nothing.\" Hopes that the pragmatic Mr Blair would break the deadlock in Mr Kiley's favour look increasingly unlikely - despite the damaging risk of judicial review or of resignation. After the three ministers met with officials it was made abundantly clear the prime minister was not about to overrule the Brown-backed public/private partnership (PPP) model which Mr Kiley calls \"Balkanisation\" of the tube at an annual shortfall of \u00a3500m a year to be paid by the taxpayer. It gives virtual ownership to three partnership companies (known as \"infra-cos\") that would be required to rebuild the network over 30 years - and take the risk. Mr Livingstone and Mr Kiley want to run the tube, and say the shambles of rail privatisation proves their point. Mr Blair points to the huge time and cost overruns when the public sector built the Jubilee line extenstion to the dome in the mid-1990s - barely one-fifth of the scale of the PPP scheme. Ministers are angry that TfL has, they claim, been briefing against the PPP blueprint without providing a plausible alternative. They accuse Mr Kiley of demanding 51% control, then changing his mind. But he is proving a formidable adversary. Earlier this month an agreement seemed in view because it appeared to cede control to Mr Kiley. Since then, the talks have gone into reverse with the government denying any such concession. Downing Street said last night the talks were continuing within the framework of the PPP, an indication it was prepared to make only modest concessions. \"The PPP offers him an extra \u00a37bn of private finance on top of big public money, up front, with a real say on the nature of the contracts, and protection against cost overruns,\" said one government official. According to Mr Kiley, under the government's proposal the public would own the system but not control it.",

Operators also face resistance from local councils over the installation of new transmission stations after residents complained about potential health risks. The terms of their 3G licences dictate that operators must offer the service to 80% of the British public by 2007. Sharing sites that already have planning permission could prevent further delays. Vodafone and Orange, the number one and number three UK operators respectively, said they would consider cooperation where it was sensible. \"It has always been our policy to use existing buildings and share sites wherever possible,\" said a spokeswoman for Orange. \"We will be able to use about 70% of our existing sites for our [3G] roll-outs.\"",

The two may not always be at odds. Some impressions are correct. Crime has doubled over the last 20 years, for example. That is a fact. Politicians' belief that the public wants only heavier sentencing is another truth that's not entirely fanciful. But the raw material Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are handling when they promote this as an election issue is not fact but propaganda, otherwise known as spin. </p> <p>Consider the opening bids made yesterday. Mr Straw, introducing Labour's 10-year plan, said that his record on crime was \"the best of any incoming government for 50 years\". Sounds impressive. Ms Widdecombe countered that the Tory record from 1993-97 was the best four-year performance any outgoing government could show. Also, relatively, true. But what voter can begin to absorb, let alone believe, either statement, when every party is busy culling statistics to show that things have never been better, or, alternatively, worse in an area of policy where, depending when you start and what you cover and how you exclude and where you shade the figures, both claims are defensible? </p> <p>Is crime going up? It depends what you're talking about. My colleagues Polly Toynbee and David Walker, in their valuable audit of the government, Did Things Get Better? (Penguin \u00a36.99) take a shot at it. Burglary? Down 21% in 2000. Car thefts? Down 15%, along with a 16% fall in thefts from cars. Crimes of violence fell by 4%. But street robbery? Up 14%. Clear-up rates? \"Haven't improved since 1997\", according to a worried memo from Straw's political adviser leaked this weekend. Ah, but what about convictions? \"Up by 13%,\" according to Straw on the Today programme yesterday. </p> <p>Such statistics will fly about in the coming weeks. For the Tories are determined to make crime one of the biggest issues. It's one of the few they've got, perhaps the only one where the glass of governance will always reliably be seen as half empty not half full. For every stat, there may be an explanation that qualifies its meaning, as the Home Office's own research department often shows. What, why, when, where, how? You could write a book on each question applied to every crime, and people do. But in the politics of law and order, sophistication, however true, will always be outgunned by simplicity, however false. </p> <p>This is made easier by public ignorance. In 1998 the British Crime Survey reported that the public thought judges' sentencing was too lenient. Four out of five people believed they were out of touch with what \"ordinary people think\". Questioned further, these ordinary people proved startlingly uninformed. Over half underestimated by at least 30% the sentences that were actually handed out. They believed half of male rapists were sent to prison, whereas the actual figure was 97%. House burglars and muggers were similarly thought to be let off, when well over half in each category went to jail. Such are the sometimes grotesque misperceptions on which the reputation of the judiciary as a soft touch is based. Yet that's the image brainlessly cultivated by the tabloid press, which then finds its inescapable way into the critique and policies of ministers. </p> <p>These policies are not always foolish. Serious experts are always trying to get to grips with the aberrations of social and human behaviour. The Thatcher-Major government passed a criminal justice act every year for so long that the later statutes began to undo what the earlier ones had done. The Blair government has a mixed record with its own creative initiatives. Both curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders, much brooded on and ostensibly reasonable, have failed to convince the people in the courts and on the ground, and have come to almost nothing. </p> <p>The latest proposed reforms also have something to be said for them. Explicitly permitting judges to take account of previous convictions when settling a sentence is a rational idea. It addresses the prime problem thrown up by the latest fashionable analysis, the familiar theme that much crime is committed by no more than 100,000 people. The package looks like serious action. It's intended to be so. It should spin well, though the Tories will, as easily and bewilderingly, spin against it. </p> <p>But through the murk and counter-murk three conclusions stare out, which confront ministers and their opponents with challenges that spinning doesn't adequately address. First, the best things the government wants to try will cost money. Yesterday's package is priced at \u00a3700m. Can this be enough to create the new custodial and semi-custodial regimes ministers talk of, pay courts to work twice as hard to accelerate hearings, and seriously increase police manpower all over the country? </p> <p>Of all remedies for deterrence and detection, common across all these confusing stats and counter-stats, a bigger police force is by far the most persuasive. Quite why Straw has so conspicuously failed to keep promises about police recruitment is a complicated mystery. It may not be entirely about money. But money will help. Is the Treasury committed to providing it for this vastly ambitious programme? Or are we watching mere propaganda sufficient unto May 3? </p> <p>Second, though Straw, to show his all-round vision, stressed the causes of crime as much as crime itself, and commended the government's education and employment programmes, there's a hole at the heart of the picture. While offering drugs as an explanation for such crime problems as he will admit to, he won't address the drug laws as a focus for reform, despite pressure and expert argument from those who are just as concerned and responsible as politicians. Decriminalising cannabis would wipe out a certain amount of crime at a stroke, freeing up police and courts for other priorities. The spinners dare not look at it. </p> <p>Third, they dictate that prisons must go on blithely multiplying. Two of the less disputable current statistics are a) that Britain has the highest proportion of its population in prison of any country in Europe, and b) that, in a league table of crime as experienced by victims, England and Wales, with 58 crimes per 100 inhabitants, came out joint first in the industrialised world. No accountable politician is willing to make a connection between these profoundly interesting trends. The lord chief justice, the inspector of prisons, and the director of the prison service have all recently delivered clinical and passionate critiques of prison. The electoral auctioneers dare not change the terms of the debate. </p> <p>One reason for this is that spinners can only deal with the lowest denominator of opinion, however ignorant.

Beside it is a bucket filled with a pungent pink liquid in which feet can be dipped before crossing this boundary.</p> <p>Such precautions have been adopted across the country. But for Cleave Farm, it is not a precautionary measure. It is too late. Cleave Farm has been infected by the same ravenous disease that consumed Burdon Farm in High Hampton less than two miles away. Now, it too is an exclusion zone.</p> <p>As farmers in the area rose early yesterday to check their livestock for blisters in their mouths and feet - the first signs of the disease - they learned that another farm had been affected. One said he would be speaking for all when he said that their \"stomachs came up into their mouth\".</p> <p>The local NFU group secretary, Simon Whattler, said a \"thinly suppressed panic\" was moving across the area.</p> <p>The outbreak was discovered on a plot rented by William Cleave, a livestock dealer now at the centre of Ministry of Agriculture investigations.</p> <p>Mr Cleave, 44, is one of the busiest sheep traders in the country and moves hundreds of animals to and from his 13 farms in Devon and Cornwall from all over the country.</p> <p>Ministry vets have ordered the slaughter of the thousands of sheep and cattle on the 11 farms he runs in Devon. The two he farms in Cornwall are thought to have escaped the cull.</p> <p>For the farmers in west Devon the reality of this outbreak began to hit home just about the same time as the fear.</p> <p>Signs at the gates of farms indicate all there is to know; \"no entry\" and \"keep out\" markers have been knocked up hastily from old wood, the wording painted in red. Farmers are barricading themselves in, afraid of any contact with the wider public.</p> <p>Mr Whattler said: \"It is very near boiling point. People are very very worried. It's such an intensive livestock area. There are no arable farms in this area, every bit is covered with sheep and cattle.\"</p> <p>Mr Whattler and other farmers are also worried about the psychological impact of the disease, which isolates farmers from their fellow farmers. The Samaritans have been briefed.</p> <p>\"We have to be very concerned about people's state of mind. The last thing we want is for anybody to do anything dreadful,\" Mr Whattler said. \"Everybody shuts down when something like his happens. People will not be gathering at pubs or going to markets.\"</p> <p>Driving along the Devon lanes, with their newly opened snowdrops, this isolation is evident. There are thick lines of straw at the gates of all farms as well as buckets and canisters of disinfectant, but there are few people and almost all the animals are kept inside.</p> <p>At West Devon Meat Ltd, the abattoir in Hatherleigh, director Peter Bowyear had just finished the slaughter of 600 sheep and 40 cattle. There will be no more culls because the place has had to close down.</p> <p>As they finished off the last animals, the workers knew it would be the end of paid work for a while. There is no insurance cover and they must go home and wait without pay.</p> <p>Mr Bowyear said: \"This time, unlike with BSE, there really isn't anyone to blame. We now have depression among the workforce.\"</p> <p>The abattoir turns over \u00a335,000 a week, killing 600 cattle and 400 sheep, mostly for export.</p> <p>Just down the hill, Hatherleigh market is also closed. The sign there says \"No implement sale on Saturday. No car boot sale on Sunday.\"</p> <p>Like everyone else, dairy farmer James McInnes has been forced to hunker down and pick up most of his information over the telephone.</p> <p>\"Farmers are all distraught, They can't believe that after all that we've been through, that this would happen. We are scared stiff because this disease is all so unknown. There is very little we can do to avoid it. When I heard that we had a second case here, I thought this isn't just a one-off.

      "bodyText": "A thick line of disinfectant-soaked straw lies at the foot of the locked gates to Cleave Farm in west Devon. Beside it is a bucket filled with a pungent pink liquid in which feet can be dipped before crossing this boundary. Such precautions have been adopted across the country. But for Cleave Farm, it is not a precautionary measure. It is too late. Cleave Farm has been infected by the same ravenous disease that consumed Burdon Farm in High Hampton less than two miles away. Now, it too is an exclusion zone. As farmers in the area rose early yesterday to check their livestock for blisters in their mouths and feet - the first signs of the disease - they learned that another farm had been affected. One said he would be speaking for all when he said that their \"stomachs came up into their mouth\". The local NFU group secretary, Simon Whattler, said a \"thinly suppressed panic\" was moving across the area. The outbreak was discovered on a plot rented by William Cleave, a livestock dealer now at the centre of Ministry of Agriculture investigations. Mr Cleave, 44, is one of the busiest sheep traders in the country and moves hundreds of animals to and from his 13 farms in Devon and Cornwall from all over the country. Ministry vets have ordered the slaughter of the thousands of sheep and cattle on the 11 farms he runs in Devon. The two he farms in Cornwall are thought to have escaped the cull. For the farmers in west Devon the reality of this outbreak began to hit home just about the same time as the fear. Signs at the gates of farms indicate all there is to know; \"no entry\" and \"keep out\" markers have been knocked up hastily from old wood, the wording painted in red. Farmers are barricading themselves in, afraid of any contact with the wider public. Mr Whattler said: \"It is very near boiling point. People are very very worried. It's such an intensive livestock area. There are no arable farms in this area, every bit is covered with sheep and cattle.\" Mr Whattler and other farmers are also worried about the psychological impact of the disease, which isolates farmers from their fellow farmers. The Samaritans have been briefed. \"We have to be very concerned about people's state of mind. The last thing we want is for anybody to do anything dreadful,\" Mr Whattler said. \"Everybody shuts down when something like his happens. People will not be gathering at pubs or going to markets.\" Driving along the Devon lanes, with their newly opened snowdrops, this isolation is evident. There are thick lines of straw at the gates of all farms as well as buckets and canisters of disinfectant, but there are few people and almost all the animals are kept inside. At West Devon Meat Ltd, the abattoir in Hatherleigh, director Peter Bowyear had just finished the slaughter of 600 sheep and 40 cattle. There will be no more culls because the place has had to close down. As they finished off the last animals, the workers knew it would be the end of paid work for a while. There is no insurance cover and they must go home and wait without pay. Mr Bowyear said: \"This time, unlike with BSE, there really isn't anyone to blame. We now have depression among the workforce.\" The abattoir turns over \u00a335,000 a week, killing 600 cattle and 400 sheep, mostly for export. Just down the hill, Hatherleigh market is also closed. The sign there says \"No implement sale on Saturday. No car boot sale on Sunday.\" Like everyone else, dairy farmer James McInnes has been forced to hunker down and pick up most of his information over the telephone. \"Farmers are all distraught, They can't believe that after all that we've been through, that this would happen. We are scared stiff because this disease is all so unknown. There is very little we can do to avoid it. When I heard that we had a second case here, I thought this isn't just a one-off. We are just at the beginning of a proper outbreak.\" Mr McInnes said the restrictions would take their toll on farmers. He worried for the sanity of one or two. \"Especially when they feel they are locked at home. The market probably won't open for a month at least, so they have nowhere to go .\" Farmer's diary 27.02.2001: A living on the edge Related articles 27.02.2001: Panic felt across the west country 27.02.2001: Call for debate angers minister 27.02.2001: Rural alliance calls off march on London 27.02.2001: Vets battle to keep track of outbreak 27.02.2001: Simon Hoggart's diary 26.02.2001: Farmers\u00d5 hopes go up in flames 26.02.2001: Dirty farm row grows 'We\u00d5ll be destroyed by this\u00d5 23.02.2001: Global disease on the rise 23.02.2001: The countryside waits... and hopes 22.02.2001, leader: Down on the farm Talk about it What do you think?

      "bodyText": "Cable giant NTL has launched a \u00a35m campaign to educate viewers about the merits of one of the most inscrutible terms in the consumer lexicon - broadband communications. The company is embarking on a new campaign to convince consumers of the benefits of broadband, which will focus on benefits such as \"always on\" internet access and high-speed connections. The marketing push follows a survey conducted by NTL which found 69% of respondents had not heard the term \"broadband\" and 31% thought it applied to radio. Cable and broadband providers have been frustrated by BT's slowness in converting local telephone exchanges to enable them to receive broadband. Despite being ordered by Oftel to speed up the process, BT has argued that it is hampered by technical difficulties. \"Cable covers 50% of UK homes. If one in two homes can get broadband, that is a huge market and we have to educate consumers,\" said a spokesman for the company. J Walter Thompson has been hired to handle NTL's above-the-line campaign, which will include press advertising.

It hedges its bets by stressing the importance of Nato while simultaneously referring to the EU's \"autonomous\" decision-making powers. If it serves to underline one thing it is that no one has yet agreed just how Nato and the EU will work together. Phrases such as \"the progressive framing of a common defence policy\" sit cheek by jowl with provisos such as provided \"it shall respect the obligations of certain member states which see their common defence realised in Nato\". The text then muddies the waters further by stressing that the EU's political and security committee should, where appropriate, have the power to exercise political and strategic leadership in peacekeeping operations. In a phrase that will be seized on by opponents of an EU army it says the bloc should have \"an autonomous capacity to take decisions and actions in the security and defence field\". Littered with ifs and buts and apparent contradictions, the text does little to clarify the EU's new defence role. That is clearly an issue that will ultimately be decided by member states. But where Nato does not want or need to get involved the treaty makes it clear that EU-led operations to cope with international crises, peacekeeping and humanitarian disasters, will be perfectly feasible. But whether individual member states get involved or not will be up to them. The text of the Nice treaty will now need to be ratified by the EU's 15 national parliaments and the European parliament before it becomes legally binding - probably 2002 at the earliest. But come 2004 it will be reviewed again and the wording on defence policy is unlikely to remain so hazy.",

In a high-stakes battle it raised the prospect that Mr Kiley might make good his veiled threat to resign his \u00a3250,000-a-year post - a move that Labour MPs fear may cost London marginals. With both sides talking tough over who will run the Underground, Mr Blair called in his two chief lieutenants for what was billed as a \"knocking-heads-together session\". Board members of Transport for London (TfL) reported Mr Kiley as \"white hot with anger\" at government obduracy. One member warned: \"I am concerned that he may do something stupid, like resigning.

After the three ministers met with officials it was made abundantly clear the prime minister was not about to overrule the Brown-backed public/private partnership (PPP) model which Mr Kiley calls \"Balkanisation\" of the tube at an annual shortfall of \u00a3500m a year to be paid by the taxpayer. It gives virtual ownership to three partnership companies (known as \"infra-cos\") that would be required to rebuild the network over 30 years - and take the risk.

      "byline": "Gareth McLean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the world of <strong> Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps </strong> (BBC2), Will Mellor was never in Hollyoaks. Had he been, Johnny and Louise might have mentioned how much their friend Gaz looked exactly like Will when they were discussing how he was at home \"jerking his gherkin\" along to the soap with most blondes per head of population. Similarly, Liz McDonald was evidently never in Coronation Street in this other world, otherwise Donna would have mentioned how her mum bore a striking resemblance to the barmaid/slapper/woman with unravelled rope instead of hair. </p> <p>Now, before you start marvelling at what a wonderful world that must be and how you really wished you lived in it - no Beverly Callard doing aerobics videos, no Will Mellor releasing cover versions of Leo Sayer songs - consider that the Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps world is also one inhabited by flimsy stereotypes cut out from How To Build Your Own Lad And Ladettes Funbook, who spout pseudo-smart one liners and for whom smoking a fag qualifies as a defining characteristic. </p> <p>Sometimes, it's better not to try and be all smart and postmodern, especially if the rest of your script is chronically unsophisticated. The higher you raise your audience's expectations, the harder it is for them to forgive you when they hurtle downwards like a tea trolley on a mountainside. </p> <p>Not that Two Pints Of Lager doesn't have any potential. It has some funny moments and there is the faintest twinkling of interesting, rounded characters. But the writing simply isn't refined enough. With another couple of years of development, Two Pints Of Lager could have been very good. As it is, it is all a bit amateur. The humour is too clumsy, the dialogue cloddish and, with the exception of Ralf Little and Beverly Callard, no one has really got the hang of comic timing. That proves to be a bit of a problem, what with this being a sitcom and all. </p> <p>If Two Pints Of Lager was made to attract younger viewers to BBC2, whoever commissioned it should have just shot themselves in the foot (or in the kneecaps, for suffering commensurate to that of the casual viewer). More trigger-happy with the remote control than their older counterparts, it is hard to imagine any of \"da kids\" sitting through this turgid, immature show. </p> <p>Of course, all of this would be fine on BBC Choice. Alas, being a central plank of BBC2's Comedy Night, Two Pints Of Lager makes the phrase Comedy Night difficult to justify. </p> <p>Despite its title - which is irritatingly obtuse while at the same time worryingly reminiscent of Kenyon Confronts -<strong> Langan Behind The Lines</strong> (BBC2) was very watchable. Once you get over Sean Langan's strange resemblance to a Tweenie (only not fluorescent, obviously), his exploits in Afghanistan are genuinely intriguing. </p> <p>Prompted by a desire to see if the anti-Muslim propaganda that we are fed in the West has any justification, this was the first leg of Langan's tour of Islamic countries. It started off well too. The Taliban he met were very friendly. They shared jokes, gave him cups of tea and even taught him to play The Afghan Egg Game. (It's a bit like conkers, apparently.) Such was their chumminess, we could even forgive them for having banned music. And probably Hollyoaks too. </p> <p>When Langan got to Kabul, he visited the Ministry of Information. But instead of asking them what becomes of the broken hearted or why cheese, chocolate and butter taste better when they're melting (questions that you would expect a Ministry of Information to know the answer to), he had a bit of tense meeting. Afterwards, it was off to the Office for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue. There, an official explained how Islam wasn't an extreme religion, how it was positively moderate and how \"we're not mad\". Then he detailed how adulterers are stoned to death and homosexuals are given the choice of a) being buried alive or b) having a wall toppled on them. I know what you are thinking - how not-at-all-extreme that is. If you're a Nazi. </p> <p>The eeriest moment of all came when Langan visited the football ground in which the punishments were carried out, unsure of whether he'd see a football game or a public execution. Clearly he was unaware that at Old Trafford, you get to see both at once. But only if Arsenal are playing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the world of Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps (BBC2), Will Mellor was never in Hollyoaks. Had he been, Johnny and Louise might have mentioned how much their friend Gaz looked exactly like Will when they were discussing how he was at home \"jerking his gherkin\" along to the soap with most blondes per head of population. Similarly, Liz McDonald was evidently never in Coronation Street in this other world, otherwise Donna would have mentioned how her mum bore a striking resemblance to the barmaid/slapper/woman with unravelled rope instead of hair. Now, before you start marvelling at what a wonderful world that must be and how you really wished you lived in it - no Beverly Callard doing aerobics videos, no Will Mellor releasing cover versions of Leo Sayer songs - consider that the Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps world is also one inhabited by flimsy stereotypes cut out from How To Build Your Own Lad And Ladettes Funbook, who spout pseudo-smart one liners and for whom smoking a fag qualifies as a defining characteristic. Sometimes, it's better not to try and be all smart and postmodern, especially if the rest of your script is chronically unsophisticated. The higher you raise your audience's expectations, the harder it is for them to forgive you when they hurtle downwards like a tea trolley on a mountainside. Not that Two Pints Of Lager doesn't have any potential. It has some funny moments and there is the faintest twinkling of interesting, rounded characters. But the writing simply isn't refined enough. With another couple of years of development, Two Pints Of Lager could have been very good. As it is, it is all a bit amateur. The humour is too clumsy, the dialogue cloddish and, with the exception of Ralf Little and Beverly Callard, no one has really got the hang of comic timing. That proves to be a bit of a problem, what with this being a sitcom and all. If Two Pints Of Lager was made to attract younger viewers to BBC2, whoever commissioned it should have just shot themselves in the foot (or in the kneecaps, for suffering commensurate to that of the casual viewer). More trigger-happy with the remote control than their older counterparts, it is hard to imagine any of \"da kids\" sitting through this turgid, immature show. Of course, all of this would be fine on BBC Choice. Alas, being a central plank of BBC2's Comedy Night, Two Pints Of Lager makes the phrase Comedy Night difficult to justify. Despite its title - which is irritatingly obtuse while at the same time worryingly reminiscent of Kenyon Confronts - Langan Behind The Lines (BBC2) was very watchable. Once you get over Sean Langan's strange resemblance to a Tweenie (only not fluorescent, obviously), his exploits in Afghanistan are genuinely intriguing. Prompted by a desire to see if the anti-Muslim propaganda that we are fed in the West has any justification, this was the first leg of Langan's tour of Islamic countries. It started off well too. The Taliban he met were very friendly. They shared jokes, gave him cups of tea and even taught him to play The Afghan Egg Game. (It's a bit like conkers, apparently.) Such was their chumminess, we could even forgive them for having banned music. And probably Hollyoaks too. When Langan got to Kabul, he visited the Ministry of Information. But instead of asking them what becomes of the broken hearted or why cheese, chocolate and butter taste better when they're melting (questions that you would expect a Ministry of Information to know the answer to), he had a bit of tense meeting. Afterwards, it was off to the Office for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue. There, an official explained how Islam wasn't an extreme religion, how it was positively moderate and how \"we're not mad\". Then he detailed how adulterers are stoned to death and homosexuals are given the choice of a) being buried alive or b) having a wall toppled on them. I know what you are thinking - how not-at-all-extreme that is. If you're a Nazi. The eeriest moment of all came when Langan visited the football ground in which the punishments were carried out, unsure of whether he'd see a football game or a public execution. Clearly he was unaware that at Old Trafford, you get to see both at once. But only if Arsenal are playing.",

MPs, those veterans of the free lunch, the free trip and the free drink are uncharacteristically turning down \"one of the perks\" of the job in droves. Official figures show that there are 652 free foreign trips going begging for 658 MPs - and there are only four weeks of the parliamentary session left in which to take them. Details of the new puritanism have been revealed by the Privy Council office, which keeps tabs on MPs' free trips. They show in the last session of parliament only 91 MPs out of the 658 took advantage of all-expenses-paid trips to Europe. This session - which began in November - only six MPs have taken up a free trip. Every MP is allowed to take one trip a year to an EU institution - either Brussels, Strasbourg or Luxembourg - paid by the taxpayer as part of his or her education. Over the last year the scheme has been extended to cover a visit to any of the capital cities - from Athens to Stockholm - of the existing 15 EU states and the 11 countries that are applying to join the EU as well. But despite being offered the delights of a spell in Prague or Budapest, MPs are not taking up their entitlement. All this is a great disappoint ment to Denis MacShane, the Europhile Labour MP for Rotherham and parliamentary private secretary to the Foreign Office minister, Keith Vaz, who has been arguing for MPs to take up the scheme. He even wanted to double the number of European taxpayer funded trips available every year - so MPs could go both to an EU centre and to a European capital of their choice. But this was turned down by Margaret Beckett, the leader of the house, who is known to take a stern view of MPs indulging themselves in any fripperies - or at least anything that Joe Public might perceive as one. Mr MacShane, a former journalist and president of the National Union of Journalists, believes that MPs are, sadly, no longer so keen on a wet weekend in Tallin, Riga or Berlin. \"Perhaps they are more interested in exotic watering holes in the Caribbean,\" he commented on the dearth of interest in the scheme.",

Dario Kordic, once vice president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat state, was found guilty of persecuting, killing and detaining Muslims in central Bosnia from late 1991 to 1994. Reuters the Hague Kursk 'sunk by its own torpedo' A note left by a sailor said the Kursk nuclear submarine was sunk by the explosion of a practice torpedo, the Izvestia newspaper reported yesterday. Russian officials found the note on a crew member during operations to retrieve the bodies of the 118 crewmen in the autumn. Izvestia quoted naval officers as saying it had been written by Lieutenant Rashid Aryapov, who said the explosion that sent the submarine crashing onto the seabed was caused by the misfiring of a practice torpedo. AP Moscow Body identified as Kuchma critic Ukrainian prosecutors ruled that a decapitated body found near Kiev in November was that of missing journalist Heorhiy Gongadze, whose disappearance led to opposition protests, reports said yesterday. Opponents of President Leonid Kuchma accuse him of involvement in the disappearance of Gongadze, a critic of high-level corruption. Mr Kuchma denies involvement. AP Kiev Shooting spree at Guam clinic A former clinic employee shot six people at the medical facility in Hagatna, Guam, before being fatally wounded by police yesterday, authorities said. Two women were killed. The gunman later died at Guam Memorial Hospital while undergoing surgery, officials said. AP Hagatna German joke offends Japan The German ambassador was summoned by Japan's foreign ministry yesterday after the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung published a picture of Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito with a joking caption questioning his fertility. The picture of the prince and his wife with the words Tote Hose - literally \"dead trousers\" - printed over the prince's groin related to a story about the couple's lack of an imperial heir.

And if I can't stand up for him, who else is going to?\"</p> <p>It is two and a half years since Barker's son James died. He was 12, a skinny, tallish, very dyslexic boy with green eyes and a love of sport. James was supposed to be caddying for his father on the day he was killed; it was his elder sister who was meant to be going on the day trip to Omagh. But she wasn't feeling well, and James begged to be allowed to go along.</p> <p>James Barker died in the bloodiest terrorist massacre ever to take place on British or Irish soil. Thirty one people were killed when the Real IRA bombed Omagh in August 1998, including a pair of unborn twins, and 400 people were injured. Most of the dead were women and children. James had been caught by the full force of the blast and died of multiple internal injuries.</p> <p>Victor Barker is not consumed, he says, but his anger and frustration are palpable. \"It's not a question of closure, but I can't just leave that little guy as an image on the front of the Sunday papers and say, well, that's what those people did, let's just leave it. I'm doing this for James. If I could walk away from this I would.\"</p> <p>After exhaustive investigations north and south of the border, the RUC and Irish police believe they know some of the men responsible for the bombing, but no one has been prosecuted for the murders, and only one man, Colm Murphy, has been charged - in the republic - with conspiracy to cause explosions. His case comes up in October.</p> <p>A BBC Panorama documentary last October examined the evidence against four men from Dundalk, a small town just south of the Northern Ireland border. The police say that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone.</p> <p>The families have decided to take matters into their own hands. \"It looks to us as victims that there will be no justice for us in the short term,\" says Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Adrian also died in the blast. \"So we were forced to look at other alternatives.\" The Omagh families are now preparing to launch a civil suit for damages against four, or possibly six, people they believe to have been involved.</p> <p>\"We saw the OJ Simpson case and that came to a conclusion where the family got some measure of justice,\" says Gallagher. \"You don't put people behind bars but you make sure that they can never escape it. Whoever was responsible shouldn't be allowed to get away with it just because they were clever in covering their tracks.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, Peter Mandelson, the former Northern Ireland secretary of state, gave \u00a310,000 to the families' campaign to raise funds for a civil suit - the proceeds, he said, of articles written explaining his case in the Hinduja affair which saw him toppled from his position. The move was greeted with a measure of cynicism in the British press, but the families say Mandelson is the only person in such a position to have shown them consistent, genuine support.</p> <p>The money will certainly be useful, but the families have a long way to go. Their solicitor, Jason McCue, a specialist in terrorism and human rights cases from the London-based law firm H&lt;+&gt;2 <!--+-->O, estimates they will need to raise \u00a31m by August. Officially, the money is to be held in case the families lose the case and have to meet the other sides' costs. But privately, Gallagher and Barker admit that they have no expectation of getting any cash out of the men they are likely to sue. Win or lose, the case is likely to be an enormous financial burden. \"I think those families have been through enough to risk losing their homes,\" says McCue. \"But they are a determined crew. They feel that if they don't follow this up it will be other people next.\"</p> <p>No one has ever won a case for damages against anyone accused of terrorism in this country, and McCue believes the case, if successful, would break international ground as well. There have been successful civil suits against unconvicted people believed or later proved to have been killers, however. In 1991 a High Court judge ruled that Michael Brookes had killed Lynn Siddons, a 16-year-old stabbed 40 times in 1978, awarding \u00a310,641 damages. The original police case was found to have been bungled, and Brookes was later convicted in a fresh criminal investigation of the murder.</p> <p>In 1998, similarly, a judge named Tony Diedrick as the killer of Joan Francisco, a doctor who had been strangled by a vacuum cleaner wire four years before. He awarded her family \u00a350,000, despite acknowledging that there was \"no direct evidence\" against him. He was also later convicted and sentenced to life.</p> <p>The option of civil action appealed, says McCue, because of the lower standard of proof required. While criminal convictions require the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, civil cases are typically decided on the balance of probabilities. It is not clear, however, under UK law at least, whether this would, in effect, be the case in a terrorist murder trial.</p> <p>In the Siddons case, Mr Justice Rougier decided to make his ruling on the criminal standard of proof because the charge was so serious. Mr Justice Alliott, however, presiding over the Francisco case, accepted the civil standard, with the caveat that the allegation could be substantiated only by \"truly cogent evidence\".</p> <p>At present McCue is reluctant to reveal the explicit grounds on which the families are likely to seek redress, beyond suggesting that \"there would be personal injury elements to it, and other torts like trespass against the person. We looked at a combination of approaches, personal injury and human rights, and we have grafted a lot of those together.\" Nor will he reveal whether proceedings will be issued north or south of the border, or both, or against whom. \"We don't want the potential defendants to have a head start.\"</p> <p>McCue is far from bullish about the chances of a successful case against the men, but Gallagher bubbles with alternatives if this avenue should be a dead end. A Catholic, he understands the suspicion many in the nationalist community retain towards the RUC, and is even prepared to discuss the murderers of his son on their own terms, as soldiers. But this does not let them off the hook, he says.</p> <p>\"We have always seen what happened in Omagh as a war crime. It was an unprovoked attack on an innocent civilian population, and we believe that these people should be tried on the same basis as the people mortar-bombing women queueing for bread in Sarajevo.\" He talks of a UN or European police force, of trials in the Hague. \"There are responsibilities for people who are engaged in armed combat. There are rules laid down by the Geneva convention that you shouldn't target civilians. So we have many options.\"</p> <p>Barker, however, is more cynical. He believes there are political reasons why the investigation has not progressed as far as it might have done. Neither is he hopeful of any financial redress, not that that is the point. But as a lawyer he appreciates the particular benefit of a civil trial.</p> <p>\"I just want them to stand in front of me and answer some questions.

Thirty years after the Equal Pay Act, women in full-time work are still earning only four-fifths of what men do.</p> <p>The equal opportunities commission's equal pay task force will press ministers to compel employers to conduct pay audits to address the gender gap. Its report, Just Pay, will highlight Britain's place at the bottom of the EU league on equal pay. While women working full-time earn on average 82% of male full-time hourly earnings - up from 69% in 1971, part-time female workers receive only 61% of male full-time hourly wages, compared with a European average of 73%.</p> <p>The proposal is designed to produce greater pay transparency in businesses, which can be expected to resist the measure on grounds of cost and bureaucracy.</p> <p>The commission will also call on the government to lead the way in reviewing pay differences, on the basis that many low paid occupations dominated by women - including nursing, caring and cleaning jobs - are in the public sector.</p> <p>The report will also find that occupations traditionally regarded as women's work are still undervalued in the UK, with women working full-time as nurses earning 6% less than average male hourly earnings. Other European countries also offer women better maternity rights and significantly better childcare provision.</p> <p>The study, compiled by a task force including business leaders, trade unionists, civil servants and academics, highlights a problem which the government's women's unit has exposed but which ministers have done little to reverse.</p> <p>A year ago, the unit published research exposing the \"female forfeit\", and concluding that women earn less than men over a lifetime not because they may take time off to bring up children but because of pay discrimination and their concentration in lower paid occupations.</p> <p>At the time, women's ministers Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell stopped short of moves to compel employers to examine pay structures, focusing instead on encouraging girls to opt for better paid careers and urging women to ask male colleagues what they earned.</p> <p>Today's study will confirm both that little has happened since to change the pay gap, and that business will strongly resist any requirement to conduct audits - a key element in the resistance to the move by some in government.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the CBI said yesterday: \"We don't believe that the pay gap is actually the result of deliberate discrimination by employers. We think pay is a far more complex issue than that.\" Women had the choice of entering better paid occupations, she said.</p> <p>The commission's report, however, argues that the pay gap cannot be explained by women's educational and career choices, since often as more women enter a sector the relative pay falls.</p>",

Thirty years after the Equal Pay Act, women in full-time work are still earning only four-fifths of what men do. The equal opportunities commission's equal pay task force will press ministers to compel employers to conduct pay audits to address the gender gap. Its report, Just Pay, will highlight Britain's place at the bottom of the EU league on equal pay. While women working full-time earn on average 82% of male full-time hourly earnings - up from 69% in 1971, part-time female workers receive only 61% of male full-time hourly wages, compared with a European average of 73%. The proposal is designed to produce greater pay transparency in businesses, which can be expected to resist the measure on grounds of cost and bureaucracy. The commission will also call on the government to lead the way in reviewing pay differences, on the basis that many low paid occupations dominated by women - including nursing, caring and cleaning jobs - are in the public sector. The report will also find that occupations traditionally regarded as women's work are still undervalued in the UK, with women working full-time as nurses earning 6% less than average male hourly earnings. Other European countries also offer women better maternity rights and significantly better childcare provision. The study, compiled by a task force including business leaders, trade unionists, civil servants and academics, highlights a problem which the government's women's unit has exposed but which ministers have done little to reverse. A year ago, the unit published research exposing the \"female forfeit\", and concluding that women earn less than men over a lifetime not because they may take time off to bring up children but because of pay discrimination and their concentration in lower paid occupations. At the time, women's ministers Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell stopped short of moves to compel employers to examine pay structures, focusing instead on encouraging girls to opt for better paid careers and urging women to ask male colleagues what they earned. Today's study will confirm both that little has happened since to change the pay gap, and that business will strongly resist any requirement to conduct audits - a key element in the resistance to the move by some in government. A spokeswoman for the CBI said yesterday: \"We don't believe that the pay gap is actually the result of deliberate discrimination by employers. We think pay is a far more complex issue than that.\" Women had the choice of entering better paid occupations, she said. The commission's report, however, argues that the pay gap cannot be explained by women's educational and career choices, since often as more women enter a sector the relative pay falls.",

      "body": "<p>Adrian Noble bounces into a Covent Garden restaurant looking as if he hasn't a care in the world. This is a man who loves his job as artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He has been doing it for a decade now and sees no reason that he shouldn't be doing it for a long time to come. </p> <p>Noble is preparing for the opening of his production of The Secret Garden, the RSC's first West End musical since Les Mis\u00e9rables, a show whose success has effectively cushioned the RSC from financial disaster for the past 15 years. Noble may have wiped out the \u00a33.5m deficit he inherited when he took over the company in March 1991, but a Les Mis-style success for The Secret Garden would be very welcome. Very much a new-style artistic supremo, Noble talks not of plays but of \"product\" and of the strength of the RSC brand. His latest wheeze is to sign the company up with Andrew Wylie, the man with the reputation of being the world's sharkiest literary agent. \"Andrew is simply the best,\" says Noble. \"He's brilliant. He likes the work of the company and we like him. People know about the RSC in every country in the world. We are a global brand and we create product that is of interest to a lot of people, and we are seeking a way by which we can find outlets for that work. It may be workshops, study aids or DVDs, but Andrew will negotiate the best commercial deals.\" </p> <p>No doubt the RSC's massive This England cycle of history plays - which reaches its climax in April, when London audiences will be able to see the entire cycle performed chronologically from Richard II through to Richard III - will soon be available on DVD, all 1,413 minutes of it. If there is any project that symbolises Noble's reign at the RSC, it is this. Noble has been its architect and midwife, although curiously he has opted to direct The Secret Garden rather than any of the Shakespeare plays in the cycle. Noble doesn't find it odd. He thinks it is just part and parcel of what it means to be a Shakespearean company in the 21st century, a question he has been thinking about a lot. So what does it mean exactly? \"It's a company that draws its inspiration from the Renaissance and provides us with epic, mythic stories but at the same time gives us a compassionate insight into the human condition.\" </p> <p>In short, a company that is as likely to embrace a 10-year-old Broadway musical such as The Secret Garden as it is to offer Hamlet or Richard II or a little-known Jacobean revenge tragedy. As far as Noble is concerned, The Secret Garden and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which he also directed for the company, are quite as interesting as any of Shakespeare's plays. In fact, he enthuses about the similarities: \"Both draw heavily from Shakespeare. The Secret Garden closely resembles As You Like It - the story of a girl who is banished, enters a forest and through growing self-realisation brings an end to chaos. It is the story of all Shakespeare's plays from Henry V to Twelfth Night.\" </p> <p>Certainly Noble sees both The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Secret Garden, which opened in Stratford-upon-Avon before Christmas, as an attempt to change the audience profile of the company, particularly in that town. The RSC's presence sometimes seems a burdensome irrelevance to local people, who may welcome the influx of visitors it brings to the town, but who never step inside any of the three theatres themselves. \"I noticed that The Secret Garden encouraged a change of attitude in the people of the West Midlands. While it was on, they regarded the theatre as theirs in a way that they often don't when we are doing Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>Only one subject dents Noble's good mood, and that's this year's Olivier awards, in which the RSC received only one nomination while the much- maligned National Theatre had a clutch of nominations and won several prizes. \"It is outrageous and unjust and in no way reflects the artistic achievements of the RSC in the year 2000. I've no more to say on the subject except that it's a disgrace, a real disgrace.\" </p> <p>But apart from this cloud, Noble reckons that he is a pretty contented man. After a long period when it sometimes seemed that the RSC was controlling him, he believes he is now firmly controlling the RSC: \"Change always brings opposition. But in the last couple of years, it has become a fantastic place to work. There are some very talented people in the company, and I now feel we are firing on all cylinders. When I think of some of the work we have done, I feel like a very proud dad. Over the next two months, we will be bringing an amazing body of work to London including This England and Tantalus, as well as a festival of new plays. It is only possible because we've been aggressively entrepreneurial. I am not going to apologise for that.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Secret Garden opens tonight at the Aldwych Theatre (0870 400 0805), London WC2.</p>",

Matrix was particularly incensed by Nick Cohen's passionate piece in the Observer the Sunday before last. To counter it, Matrix asked a number of respected human rights QCs in other chambers to put their names to a letter to the Observer, defending Blake. I gather that some of those approached declined, and no letter appeared in the newspaper.</p> <p>But I've also found a backlash of sympathy for Blake, whose previous record as a human rights barrister is impeccable, with many of his cases done free, not least appeals by prisoners facing execution in the Caribbean. Blake, under the rules of the Bar, can't defend himself until the Fijian case is over, which may be this week. The odd thing, though, is that it has seemed in the past couple of weeks that Matrix itself has been on trial, and convicted.</p> <p>\u0095 This is Lord Irvine's future: in 2003 he will retire gracefully from the office of lord chancellor. I know this because I've discussed it with many lawyers and politicians over several weeks, and this is the consensus. The argument is that he will want to go out on a high, and by then he will have achieved his aim of being regarded as one of the great reforming lord chancellors of modern times. He's already put away the Human Rights Act and the radical reorganisation of access to justice. In a couple of years, House of Lords reform will be well under way. That's when Irvine leaves, the plaudits of a grateful nation ringing in his ears, his peccadilloes forgotten.</p> <p>Who takes over? That's easy. There's a general assumption that the current attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, already the most popular and praised figure in the Lords, will become its leader after the election. But it's not really a job with substance, and he'll be bored with it in two years, thus making the timing perfect for him to take over as lord chancellor. There's only one thing wrong with this astute scenario. What would Lord Irvine do? At 63 he'd be too young to go into that half-retirement that awaits other top legal persons - the occasional government commission or inquiry, a few prestige chairmanships of high-profile societies or charities, a worthy book. I don't think he is suited to be a European commissioner; nor the head of an Oxford or Cambridge college, which involves a lot of fund-raising, though usually for more than \u00a3200 a nosh. The trouble is, I can't think of any real jobs he could do that would befit his status.</p> <p>\u0095 This I have not come across before - a professional organisation objecting to its own members being offered good salaries. But this is what the Law Society appears to be doing. The other day adverts appeared seeking lawyers to join the new state-salaried criminal defence service and become public defenders. A solicitor with three years experience would get \u00a330,000 a year. Unfair, moaned the Law Society - too much. That's more than similar solicitors make in private practice; it's all a government plot.</p> <p>If you think I'm exaggerating, here are the actual words used by a Law Society spokesman, after pointing out that salaries were \"much greater\" than private firms could pay: \"It confirms what we have thought all along, that it is an underhand way to destroy us.\" So what's the government to do? Offer really rubbish salaries so that only rubbish people apply? Precisely. Then, the Law Society could say: \"We told you so.

(Boyfriend Ken, I remind you, has no genitals, though Barbie could, of course, be having a secret affair with an anatomically correct doll.) Forsythe claimed his rights of artistic expression and free speech: he used Barbies to critique the materialistic and gender oppressive values the doll embodies.

In the western woods the first flowers of butterbur, primrose, and the evil-smelling and poisonous dog's mercury have also opened, while tucked away between the exposed roots of a tall oak, a group of early dog violets continue to protect their bright blue petals inside tightly closed buds. A plant that has been in flower since late January, as it is each year, is the small shrub spurge laurel or Daphne laureola, which grows in the northern woods at what is its only site in Cheshire. Positioned in a high rocky outcrop overlooking the river, its ridged stems support a crown of fresh green foliage, while the flowers themselves are green and fragrant, each protected by a tubular waxy coat, and they produce a black berry in autumn which the early herbalists sometimes recommended for certain stomach ailments - \"taken in warm water they soon stir the innards\" - being poisonous they certainly would!",

The fit, breezy-looking guy with the most tanks and the most K-rations? A flying jacket is a tricky piece of kit for a middle-aged bloke to wear at the weekend - but Dubya pulled it off, didn't he?</p> <p>He's a Texan. You only have to see him in his cowboy boots and you just know he can ride rodeo and rope steers. You only have to look at him waving goodbye to Tony and Cherie and you just know he could fly their goddamn helicopter back to JFK. It's a controversial wardrobe call, a flying jacket, but it added a certain manly something to their World Leaders Walk Through The Woods photo-op: Dubya striding through the snow in winter-weight boots and his flying jacket; Tony trotting beside him like a history teacher in an Oxford Street jumper and blue suede shoes. Honestly.</p> <p>It was so sweet of George to get one specially logo-ed up for Tony to take home. \"TONY BLAIR\" it said. \"CAMP DAVID.\" A very acceptable souvenir. Obviously, Tony's wasn't as nice as Dubya's own - it wasn't leather; it didn't have a presidential seal on it; and it didn't have that sexy world war two-type beaver-fur collar. (Give it to Euan, Tony! He can wear it with a proper po-faced teen irony: \"My Dad went to Camp David and all I got was a Star Wars deal, a qualified endorsement on the European de fence initiative, and this lousy flying jacket.\")</p> <p>Tony obviously liked his gift because he put it on straight away for the Pre-Helicopter-Takeoff photo-op. So the world's press got Dubya looking like General MacArthur, Tony looking like the man who cleans the top gun's latrine, and Cherie looking like a woman walking through Brent Cross shopping centre carpark in a hurricane in a 10ft woolly scarf. I thought it was a turban for a minute there.</p> <p>Obviously, Tony had to put the jacket on for the chopper-ride - he hadn't got anything else to wear. I just don't know what Tony's people think they're doing when they're packing his bag. We'll get to his toothpaste choices in a minute - but doesn't Downing Street watch the world weather reports before they jet him off to foreign parts? Where were his Timberlands? Where was his guernsey? Where was his Barbour?</p> <p>It's such a pity they've had to cancel the countryside march because of foot and mouth: Tony could have learned something from non-Londoners about dressing for walkabouts in sneaky spring weather. (People down my way have been oiling their boots and fluffing up their Damarts for weeks now.) Where did Downing Street think they were packing for - Portobello Road? The whole idea of a foreign photo-op, with a spring electoral shoo-in round the corner, is to get plenty of footage. You want your man standing next to the leader of the free world looking as well-prepared, well-turned-out and statesmanlike as possible, not shivering through the snow in a telly-presenter's weekend jumper and blue suede shoes. The whole Downing Street crew looked as though they'd left London in a daze - Jonathan Powell even had to borrow an overcoat, he got so chilly.</p> <p>As to the toothpaste: it was two-nil to the White House. When Bush answered the \"So what have you guys got in common?\" question with \"We both use Colgate toothpaste,\" I thought Tony was going to choke. Talk about leftfield - it was like watching the Women's Institute. Colgate? Colgate? What dentifricial hell is this? You could see he didn't know Colgate from KY Jelly.</p> <p>In America, the mostly Democrat-leaning media, who take very little notice of major summit meetings with grinning Brit politicians, just thought the Colgate throwaway was a meaningless Bushism. A subliminable foot-in-mouth - fuhgeddaboudit. The British Embassy in Washington (who take so much notice of major summit meetings that they've been running around for weeks talking up the special relationship) thought it was a savage put-down.</p> <p>There was a sharp intake of breath and everybody started swaying.</p> <p>They're still talking about what on earth Bush can have meant - was he just guessing? Is there some blue-collar Texan innuendo about blokes using the same toothpaste? Or was Dubya just proving how well-prepared he was? Maybe the White House butler checks inside the spongebag. Maybe he pre-pastes the visiting VIP toothbrush and leaves it ready-to-brush. We'll never know. We'll never know why he came up with his after-dinner movie idea, either. Meet the Parents? A De Niro vehicle, it is the kind of bland Hollywood comedy you don't even bother to watch on the flight out to Canada. (It actually was the in-flight movie on the Blairs' flight out to Canada.) Dubya isn't an after-dinner movie kind of sophisticate, anyway - he likes to dine at six, retire at ten and rise at five like other rancheros.</p> <p>So Tony's people are still fretting about this Bushism as well. Was Meet the Parents a diplomatic triumph for Downing Street in that their man managed to keep the president up long past his bedtime? Or was the choice of movie an outright triumph for the White House? (\"What have we got that's kind of middle-of-the-road and unspecial? Meet the Parents? Heh-heh, good call.\")</p> <p>I reckon it was a win for the White House, and God knows what Downing Street will have to come up with on the return visit. It'll have to be theatre for Americans, won't it? Art? Lulu? Henry IV? No, no - too highbrow. Buddy? Blood Brothers? No, God, no - think of the headlines.

Unisys, Microsoft and Dell are working on an electronic system that would employ a smart card. Some claim that internet voting will be in use by 2004 but others say it will be decades before fears recede that hackers could interfere. \"I haven't seen us move fast on any of these things,\" said Jim Cannavino, chief executive of CyberSafe, a computer security firm. \"I don't want to have a president elected by the guys who spray-paint buses.\" How to vote: Punch or pull Paper ballots: voters put an X by name of candidate (introduced 1789) and used in areas with 1% of voters. Lever machines: devices where votes are cast by pulling a lever beside candidate's name. Introduced 1892: 18%. Punch cards: voters use stylus to make hole indicating choices then read by computer (1964): 36%. Optical scanners: voters fill in ballots which are then scanned by computers. Introduced early 1980s: used by 27%. Electronic: choices indicated by pushing a button or by touching a screen (introduced late 1980s): 9%.

      "body": "<p>Things must look bad to the outside world this morning because Michael, our very reliable postman, asked if we wanted our mail left somewhere else or even delivered to my mother-in-law, who lives eight miles away, rather than him driving up the one-mile road to our farm. The milkman also left our delivery of fresh pints and eggs at the end of the road.</p> <p>My husband, Peter, and I run an upland livestock farm in Northumberland. We have two teenage children, James and Victoria. Our 1,163-acre grassland farm lies around 13 miles from Hexham, just on the boundary of Infected Area Two, as pronounced by the Ministry of Agriculture on Saturday. This is a mapped-out area where special precautions against foot and mouth should be taken by everyone, especially those living on farms.</p> <p>Our business up here is breeding and fattening beef cattle and sheep. We grow no arable crops - the land is much too rough, and once ploughed the ground is very stony, with boulders to pick up and move. We are in what is known as a \"less favoured area\" because our land is all between 620ft (190m) and 750ft (230m) above sea level. The growing season is short, from April to September, and the winds very strong; there are not many trees, except a few small conifer plantations kept for shelter for the livestock. We have almost 40 miles of stone walls dividing up our many fields.</p> <p>We have a lot of livestock, and this is the great worry for us just now. We have 1,063 ewes, due to start lambing at the end of March. (The lambing season will then last about six weeks.) We worry that being pregnant may make them more vulnerable to infections of all kinds. Just over 600 of these are mule ewes in lamb to our Suffolk rams; the remainder are hill sheep - Scottish Blackface - in lamb to our Cheviot rams. On the farm there are also 200 ewe hoggs, the young sheep that come into the ewe flock in the autumn to replace the old ones. We also have 25 rams, one Limousin bull, 52 An gus cross cows with Limousin cross calves and 65 Limousin cross store cattle (last year's calves, which are being fattened for slaughter).</p> <p>We have one full-time employee, Graham Dick, and he works as a shepherd-cum-stockman, helping Peter daily to tend to and feed the livestock. He lives on the farm in a bungalow with his wife, Sue, and their two grown-up children. Graham has several very well-trained collie dogs that he uses every day and we just have two pet dogs: a black Labrador and a Capheaton terrier (a Northumbrian speciality: a small, smooth-haired, ginger-coloured terrier that adores children).</p> <p>As I write this on Monday afternoon, Peter is outside feeding the cattle, which are housed in the shed, on silage. He and Graham work very hard feeding the cattle in the sheds and in the fields twice a day. The sheep are fed once a day at the trough with a compound feed specially prepared for pregnant ewes, and they get hay as well - on the ground and in a covered hay rack - which lasts them overnight.</p> <p>As we have a good covering of snow on the ground today they are getting extra hay, and it gives us all a chance to look at them a little more closely. During the afternoon feedings each day the cattle are bedded down with clean straw, which we often refer to as \"clean sheets\". This barley straw was bought in from a supplier in the autumn as we grow no crops of our own except for hay and silage.</p> <p>Because of the atrocious autumn weather that we've had, there is a great shortage of straw within the livestock industry, and these new movement restrictions may cause some farmers extra difficulties over feed and forage. Peter remains confident just now that we will have enough, though we are desperate, like everyone else in our region, for more disinfectant.</p> <p>Local supplies ran out on Friday and fresh stocks are urgently needed. I've just rung our local agricultural merchants and they say it will come tomorrow. They have just been let down and had to change their suppliers, so here's hoping. We used the very last of our disinfectant stocks to construct a straw and chemical barrier at the end of the road. This B road and a good part of our land runs alongside the Infected Area Two boundary, but two of our neighbours who find themselves caught in this 10-mile zone also run some of their animals on our side of the main road, in fields next to ours.</p> <p>News bulletins, phone calls and vital updates via the internet have become a way of life in the past five days. Last Tuesday we sold a few hoggs and old cull ewes at Hexham Auction Mart and we had planned to sell the last of last year's lamb crop on Friday, in preparation for the arrival of this year's crop. But the mart cancelled the sale owing to suspicions about a farm at Heddon-on-the Wall - suspicions that were soon confirmed, as the whole country now knows.</p> <p>I just saw Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, give his statement - live on TV - to the House of Commons. My heart gave such a lurch when he announced that the farmer in Devon must have all the stock on all his Devon holdings destroyed. If we were unlucky enough to be infected by this outbreak, it is unlikely that we would want to continue with farming at all because our children, like so many other farm children in the 21st century, are not remotely interested in this way of life. But to be forced to retire by the destruction of all your animals and life's work . . . it hardly bears thinking about.</p> <p>And so the wait goes on. We check our livestock over and over again; we talk to our neighbours in an attempt to keep each other's spirits up; and we hope - and some of us even pray - that in the morning all will be well, or at least not worse. <br><br><b>Talk about it</b><br> <br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">Special report: what's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Special report: countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><br><b>Related articles</b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443089,00.html\">26.02.2001: Farmers' hopes go up in flames</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443066,00.html\">26.02.2001: Dirty farm row grows</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443057,00.html\">'We'll be destroyed by this'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,441785,00.html\">23.02.2001: Global disease on the rise</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,441783,00.html\">23.02.2001: The countryside waits... and hopes</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,441177,00.html\">22.02.2001, leader: Down on the farm</a></p> <p><b>Background</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/0,6514,180991,00.html\">21.02.2001, the issue explained: Foot-and-mouth disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">21.02.2001, NetNotes: Pigs</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers Union</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot-and-mouth disease</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Things must look bad to the outside world this morning because Michael, our very reliable postman, asked if we wanted our mail left somewhere else or even delivered to my mother-in-law, who lives eight miles away, rather than him driving up the one-mile road to our farm. The milkman also left our delivery of fresh pints and eggs at the end of the road. My husband, Peter, and I run an upland livestock farm in Northumberland. We have two teenage children, James and Victoria. Our 1,163-acre grassland farm lies around 13 miles from Hexham, just on the boundary of Infected Area Two, as pronounced by the Ministry of Agriculture on Saturday. This is a mapped-out area where special precautions against foot and mouth should be taken by everyone, especially those living on farms. Our business up here is breeding and fattening beef cattle and sheep. We grow no arable crops - the land is much too rough, and once ploughed the ground is very stony, with boulders to pick up and move. We are in what is known as a \"less favoured area\" because our land is all between 620ft (190m) and 750ft (230m) above sea level. The growing season is short, from April to September, and the winds very strong; there are not many trees, except a few small conifer plantations kept for shelter for the livestock. We have almost 40 miles of stone walls dividing up our many fields. We have a lot of livestock, and this is the great worry for us just now. We have 1,063 ewes, due to start lambing at the end of March. (The lambing season will then last about six weeks.) We worry that being pregnant may make them more vulnerable to infections of all kinds. Just over 600 of these are mule ewes in lamb to our Suffolk rams; the remainder are hill sheep - Scottish Blackface - in lamb to our Cheviot rams. On the farm there are also 200 ewe hoggs, the young sheep that come into the ewe flock in the autumn to replace the old ones. We also have 25 rams, one Limousin bull, 52 An gus cross cows with Limousin cross calves and 65 Limousin cross store cattle (last year's calves, which are being fattened for slaughter). We have one full-time employee, Graham Dick, and he works as a shepherd-cum-stockman, helping Peter daily to tend to and feed the livestock. He lives on the farm in a bungalow with his wife, Sue, and their two grown-up children.

Meanwhile, an Iraqi delegation began two days of talks in New York with the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, aimed at resolving the impasse over weapons inspections and lifting sanctions. Mr Powell has been urging Arab leaders to keep pressure on Baghdad to prevent it amassing weapons of mass destruction. He has also been sounding out Arab opinion on replacing the blanket embargo against Iraq with \"smart\" sanctions designed to target the Saddam Hussein regime specifically. During a three-hour stop in Saudi Arabia, Mr Powell met King Fahd and the foreign minister, Prince Saud.

The exports could be legitimised and included in the UN's Oil for Food programme at the request of Iraq or Syria, but so far neither has asked for this.

Describing the two Ukip MEPs, the text said they sometimes came over \"like Caldicott and Charters, the old buffers who kept talking about the Test score while travelling Europe in Strangers on a Train\". The two films where Charters and Caldicott worry on trains about catching up with the Test results are Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938) and Night Train to Munich (1940). Geographical confusion: Bangui was sited in the Philippines rather than its native Central African Republic in a panel on page 9 yesterday. The text, meanwhile, shifted the Republic of Congo towns of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire to the adjacent Democratic Republic of Congo. MPs voted by a majority of 244 against keeping the status quo on fox hunting, rather than 224 as stated in an article on page 12, February 22, about whether a commitment to ban such hunts would would be dropped from Labour's manifesto. \"I want to know everything,\" said the king, asking to be kept informed in 1934 when cricket's great Donald Bradman was seriously ill. The speaker was George V, not VI, as yesterday's panel said on page 6, Sport. Our Bafta report, page 3, was mistaken in saying yesterday that the film Some Voices was a \"massive sleeper hit\" in US cinemas. \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

Presumably for the same reason that, when we were deceived into buying and eating infected beef, it was we who had to pay the compensation.</p> <p>If the industry had to carry the full cost of such outbreaks, would it still follow such practices as shipping pigs from one end of the country to the other to be slaughtered? <br><b> John Riseley </b><br>Farnborough, Hampshire<br><a href=\"mailto:johnriseley@hotmail.com\">johnriseley@hotmail.com</a></p> <p>The British farmer is double crossed by consumers who, led by well funded animal rights organisations, make greater and greater demands upon the farmers, but then fail to put their money where their very strident mouths are.

The British farmer complies with these welfare standards at enormous cost in terms of buildings, feed, safety regulations, bureaucratic-heavy assurance schemes - all imposed, but not adhered to, by farmers in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>If the infection is traced back to a rogue import of cheap beef, the blame can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of British consumers who, having demanded a high quality product, refuse to pay for it. Instead they fuel a market for cheap food produced under conditions that would make them weep, and which results in the undermining and collapse of an entire industry. <br><b>Carole Mann</b><br>Lechlade, Gloucestershire<br><a href=\"mailto:chipps@epinet.co.uk\">chipps@epinet.co.uk</a></p> <p>Is the wind which carries the foot and mouth virus five, 10 or 150 miles the same wind which carries pollen from GM crops a careful 300m? <br><b>Tony Winters</b><br>Kinver, West Midlands</p> <p>The plans by the pharmaceutical industry to genetically modify pigs with human genes so that the heart can be used in organ transplant operations raises a number of interesting questions.

The draconian measures put in place to contain it are for the protection of the farming industry. Why, then, is the compensation for this to be funded by the taxpayer rather than by the farming industry? Presumably for the same reason that, when we were deceived into buying and eating infected beef, it was we who had to pay the compensation. If the industry had to carry the full cost of such outbreaks, would it still follow such practices as shipping pigs from one end of the country to the other to be slaughtered? John Riseley Farnborough, Hampshire johnriseley@hotmail.com The British farmer is double crossed by consumers who, led by well funded animal rights organisations, make greater and greater demands upon the farmers, but then fail to put their money where their very strident mouths are. This country produces the safest food in the world, reared from cradle to table under the strictest welfare conditions in the world. The British farmer complies with these welfare standards at enormous cost in terms of buildings, feed, safety regulations, bureaucratic-heavy assurance schemes - all imposed, but not adhered to, by farmers in Europe and beyond. If the infection is traced back to a rogue import of cheap beef, the blame can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of British consumers who, having demanded a high quality product, refuse to pay for it. Instead they fuel a market for cheap food produced under conditions that would make them weep, and which results in the undermining and collapse of an entire industry. Carole Mann Lechlade, Gloucestershire chipps@epinet.co.uk Is the wind which carries the foot and mouth virus five, 10 or 150 miles the same wind which carries pollen from GM crops a careful 300m? Tony Winters Kinver, West Midlands The plans by the pharmaceutical industry to genetically modify pigs with human genes so that the heart can be used in organ transplant operations raises a number of interesting questions. In theory would it be possible for a transplant patient to contract foot and mouth disease? Would the foot and mouth mutate in that human host and spread? Perhaps Nick Brown, our esteemed agriculture minister, could volunteer for an operation just to prove its safety, but failing that I am sure that John Gummer could provide one of his relative to go under the knife in order to allay public concern.

There is a similar unequivocal message in yesterday's plan: a \"justice gap\" which must be closed by catching and committing more hard core criminals.

Deutsche Bank says the company has put in an \"excellent performance\" with like-for-like sales up 8% during a time in which the carpet market remains, at best, flat. Its new division, Harris carpets at home, which sells quality carpets off the back of a lorry at consumers' front doors had a \"slower than expected response\" but is still predicted to break through into profit by next year. Deutsche Bank's profit-before-tax forecast for the year to April 2001 on the firm remains unchanged at \u00a345.5m. It says that despite the recently strong share price, which last night stood at 650p, the rating was only just catching up with the growth in earnings.",

      "bodyText": "Vets were struggling to keep track of possible sources of foot and mouth infection after five new cases - the largest daily total so far - were confirmed yesterday. European countries reacted to the crisis by closing markets, tracking down all live sheep and pigs exported from Britain and killing thousands of animals as a precaution. With a new outbreak confirmed at an abattoir at Bromham, in Wiltshire, for the first time in sheep, an incredibly complex web of auctions and trading began to be revealed. Checks involving many thousands of animals from dozens of farms - all of which could have been in contact with infection - threw up three new confirmed outbreaks within a few hours. There are now three each in Devon, Northumberland and Essex, two in Wiltshire and one in Herefordshire. The outbreaks in the west are all connected to the Devon sheep dealer Willy Cleave, who had a confirmed case of foot and mouth in cattle at his home at Burdon Farm, Highampton on Sunday. All 1,100 sheep on the 10 farms Mr Cleave owns in Devonare to be slaughtered as a precaution. A further confirmed outbreak yesterday, bringing the total to 12, was in Northumberland, at a pig farm close to the oldest known outbreak at Heddon-on-the-Wall and thought to be an infection carried on the wind. In a statement to MPs, Nick Brown, the agriculture minister said he still hoped that the total ban on the movement of farm and zoo animals, combined with the tracking of all suspected herds and animals by officials would be enough to contain the outbreak, but investigations were continuing at \"a number of premises where there is reason to believe there may be disease.\" He said that in addition to the 100% compensation farmers will get for the value of the stock that is destroyed, the government was considering applying to the EU for an extra \u00a3200m to compensate farmers for loss of markets.

Farmers are at their wits' end but we are asking them to stay put.\" Farmers and Mr Brown are asking the public to stay away from farms. Mr Brown told MPs that officials were making plans temporarily to close footpaths and rights of way. The agricultural crisis is also beginning to influence the government's calculations over the date of the election. There was speculation at Westminster yesterday that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease may kill off any chances of the poll being held on April 5, making May 3 a more likely date. Parliament would have to be prorogued by March 12 to allow for an election on April 5, something that is unlikely if movement is still restricted in many areas of the country. Ben Gill, president of the NFU, last night warned the government that it could not hold the election until the disease has been eradicated. Speaking on Channel 4 News after meeting the prime minister, Mr Gill said: \"To have a campaign in the countryside would not in my mind be possible. In fact it would be counterproductive against the control of the disease until such time as we have this disease under control.\" The impact of the crisis on the timing of the election was raised in the commons by the veteran Labour backbencher Tam Dalyell. Mr Brown said he would pass the matter \"to those who can take more interest in it than I can\". The number of animals af fected across Britain is rising quickly. There are now thousands of sheep to be killed and disposed of in addition to more than 3,000 cattle and pigs already killed and incinerated.

All these animals had to be traced too. \"We can only hope that these sheep at Ponteland were incubating the disease and were not spreading infection as they travelled down to Wiltshire. They may not have been infectious all the while but we have to check to make sure,\" he said. As tracing infections became more complex, vets were being brought in from the EU, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States to help. Talk about it What do you think?

Echoing ABB, Mr Wood observes: \"You have to do it to be there.\" </p> <p>He argues that some of the benefits will come through in the form of better services to customers. E-commerce will not mean cutting a swath through the ranks of the company's sales engineers, for example. </p> <p>\"We are not going to see them all being fired.

What is happening is that it frees the sales engineer to add value, rather than spending time having to check what is happening to the customer's order.\" </p> <p>Back-office areas, however, are likely to be affected as areas such as travel arrangement and expenses are dealt with using central online systems </p> <p>As business seeks to change in order to take advantage of the benefits of e-commerce, Mr Wood has a warning for those who are hoping that the process of that change is finite. The introduction of third-generation mobile phones \"is going to bring true internet on the move. It is going to change the way we do business even more.\"</p>",

What is happening is that it frees the sales engineer to add value, rather than spending time having to check what is happening to the customer's order.\" Back-office areas, however, are likely to be affected as areas such as travel arrangement and expenses are dealt with using central online systems As business seeks to change in order to take advantage of the benefits of e-commerce, Mr Wood has a warning for those who are hoping that the process of that change is finite. The introduction of third-generation mobile phones \"is going to bring true internet on the move. It is going to change the way we do business even more.\"",

At the end of a one-day conference in London on combating child poverty, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the international development secretary, Clare Short, announced that Britain would increase development assistance and urged other wealthy nations to do the same. Meanwhile, in Brussels, the world's 48 poorest countries yesterday won the right to export almost any product they make to the EU in unlimited quantity and, for the first time, free of all import duty. The British government had planned to boost aid to 0.33% of GNP by 2003-04, but Mr Brown has agreed to go further after pressure from Ms Short. Mr Mandela, former president of South Africa, had said the purpose of the conference was to \"get specific commitments...and get specific results.\" The chancellor said the closing declaration said the meeting had encouraged the various bodies to \"work together to commit to a clear set of specific actions for which we all be individually accountable\". He added that the pledges were vital if the international community was to make up lost ground in achieving the targets for 2015 set by the UN six years ago of halving global poverty, cutting infant mortality by two-thirds and providing universal primary education. \"We aim, through achieving these targets, to offer this generation of poor children the opportunities denied to their parents,\" Mr Brown said. Government sources said the real achievement of the conference had been to secure specific commitments from the UN agencies Unicef and UNDP, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, developed and developing countries. Britain is to launch a fund to help provide primary education in the Commonwealth and is working with Italy for a $1bn fund to provide cheap drugs for poor countries - with half coming from donations of $500,000 each from the world's 1000 biggest corporations and the rest from developed governments. James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, attacked developed countries for cutting back on aid budgets and \"turning their backs on Africa and its children\" at a time of unprecedented prosperity. \"It is a time for a concerted appeal to the heads of governments of major aid donors to make it clear once and for all that development assistance is not charity, but a vital investment in global peace and security.\" Yesterday's decision by EU foreign ministers in Brussels to back the \"Everything but Arms\" initiative, in the face of French opposition, is designed to alleviate poverty in the developing world and will pile pressure on the US and Japan to grant similar trade concessions.

Intelligence gathering $290m will be spent on reconnaissance aeroplanes and intelligence-gathering aimed at narcotics installations deep in the Amazon jungle. Alternative development $68.5m will fund development schemes to help small farmers switch from drug crops to alternatives such as rubber, tropical fruit and cattle-ranching. Human rights $51m will go to projects to improve Colombia's atrocious human rights record. Attention to war refugees $22.5m is earmarked to help Colombia's internal war refugees.

So they had to be verified on the spot. The visit began on February 18. I heard dozens of harrowing accounts from people who had been exposed to torture and maltreatment by Russian troops: stories so horrific that one's hand refused to jot them down.</p> <p>And then I experienced at first hand events in which I myself was the victim.</p> <p>It is as if pictures had come to life to confirm the accounts I had heard. Now the person to whom they shouted: \"Stop! Get a move on!\" was myself. And an official of the FSB - the successor to the KGB - a first lieutenant of tender age, whispered dirty insults in my ear: \"You are one of them... You should be shot...\"</p> <p>One of the first accounts of torture was given to me by Rozita, from the village of Tovzeni. She can barely move her lips, her eyes have a vacuous expression, and she still walks with difficulty. Her feet and kidneys ache.</p> <p>A month ago Rozita was brought to what she called a filtration camp for \"sheltering militants\". It was a real concentration camp, run on a commercial basis, on the outskirts of the village of Khottuni, in the Vedeno district, where the Russian 45th Airborne Regiment and 119th Paratroop Regiment are stationed.</p> <p>Rozita is no longer young. She has many children and several grandchildren. The youngest of them is three and previously spoke no Russian, but having seen how her grandmother was detained, now constantly shouts: \"Lie down on the floor.\"</p> <p>Rozita was arrested in her home at dawn when everybody was asleep. They took her completely by surprise and they did not let her to pack her things properly. She was thrown into a pit in the grounds of the camp outside Khottuni.</p> <p>\"Did they push you? Did they kick you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, that's the usual thing.\"</p> <p>Rozita spent 12 days in the pit. The soldier who guarded it took pity on her one night and threw her a piece of rug.</p> <p>\"I curled up on it. The soldier is a human being after all,\" she said.</p> <p>The pit was shallow - 1.20 metres (4ft) - and arranged so that the occupant seemed to be in cold mountain air in winter, with no roof overhead, but was unable to stand up because of massive logs across the top which could not be dislodged with the head. So she spent 12 days squatting or sitting on the piece of rug.</p> <p>Rozita never learned whom she had \"sheltered\". No charges were ever brought against her, although she was interrogated three times.</p> <p>Officers young enough to be her sons introduced themselves as FSB people. They put \"children's mittens\" on her. That means that she had one end of a live wire attached to the fingers of one hand and the other end to the fingers of the other hand. And the wires were slung across the back of her neck.</p> <p><b> Torture</b><br></p> <p>\"Yes, I screamed something terrible,\" she said. \"It hurt a lot when they turned on the current. But I didn't scream otherwise. I was afraid to provoke them. The FSB people said: 'You aren't dancing well enough. Let's add some more voltage.' And so they did.\" And Rozita screamed louder and louder.</p> <p>\"Why did they torture you? Did you know?\" \"No. They didn't ask any specific questions\".</p> <p>Meanwhile the officers told Rozita's relatives through go-betweens that they had better raise money for a ransom. They were told to hurry up because Rozita was not enduring her stay in the pit very well and she might not last too long. After a while the money was brought and Rozita, filthy and unkempt, shuffled toward the regimental checkpoint and her freedom.</p> <p>So, who is granny Rozita from Tovzeni? A militant? If not, why was she detained? If so, why was she released?</p> <p>The commander of the 45th Regiment is an attractive-looking, strong-willed man. A colonel who has seen action in Afghanistan and Chechnya. He curses the war, thinks aloud about his children, who are growing up without a father and, if he had his way, would like to end the Chechen war at once. He has had enough.</p> <p>He is taking me on a guided tour of the grounds of the regiment's garrison in Khottuni, where Rozita was held. Eventually we come to the most essential place. He shows me the pits into which Chechens are thrown after the mopping up operations. He is considerate and he holds my elbow lest I fall into a six-metre hole in the ground.</p> <p>The pit looks exactly as it was described by the numerous people who have been in it. It measures three by three metres. There is a stench coming from the pit, despite the winter frost. The Chechens are meant to urinate and defecate in the pit. And they spend day and night standing. They have a choice of sitting down.</p> <p>The commander appears to be very uneasy about what is happening, and he tells me some surprising things. One day a general flew in to inspect the regiment. He saw the detained Chechens standing in the field and ordered them to be kept in the pits, originally dug for dumping rubbish in. The colonel sounds sincere when he says: \"But we put only the rebels there. Not ordinary people.\"</p> <p>Then there is the account of Isa, who lives in Selmentauzen, also in the Vedeno area of southern Chechnya. He was brought to the camp in early February. They stubbed out cigarettes on his body, they pulled out his nails, and beat him over the kidneys with Pepsi Cola bottles filled with water. Then they threw him down into a pit called the \"bathtub\". It was filled with water. After throwing in the Chechens, they threw in smoke sticks. Isa survived. Not all did.</p> <p>Isa shared the pit with five other men. The junior officers who interrogated them told them that they had nice butts, and raped them. And they added as an excuse: \"Your women wouldn't let us fuck them.\"</p> <p>These Chechens now say they will spend the rest of their lives taking revenge for \"nice butts\".</p> <p>Isa never quite recovered from the shock. Like Rozita, he was later released for a ransom raised by his whole village.</p> <p>Experiences like those of Isa and Rozita show that the Chechen war has reversed the roles of victims and tormentors. The declared target of the \"counter-terrorist operation\" - rampant hostage-taking, slavery and ransoms - is now the business engaged in by the military.</p> <p>Two minutes after I said goodbye to the commander, I was detained. First they made me stand in the middle of a rutted field for more than an hour. Then an armoured vehicle with armed fighters led by a first lieutenant arrived. Their identities were unknown. They seized me, pushed me with their rifle butts, and took me away.</p> <p>\"Your papers are false, you are one of them [the Chechen rebels],\" I was told. Then followed interrogations for hours on end. Young officers reminded me pointedly that they were from the FSB and that they took their orders only from President Putin himself. They made it clear to me that freedom was over.</p> <p>I omit the most disgusting details of the interrogations, because they are utterly obscene. But it is these details - and my tormentors couldn't have imagined it - that provided the key proof that everything the Chechens had earlier told me about tortures and man-handling was true.</p> <p>From time to time the zealous young officers were joined by a senior officer, a lieutenant-colonel with a swarthy face and dark, stupid, bulging eyes. Every now and then he sent the youngsters out of the tent, switched on what he thought to be romantic music and hinted that if I behaved right I could count on a \"favourable outcome\".</p> <p><b> Screeching</b><br></p> <p>In the intervals between his appearances, the \"youngsters\" did a competent job touching upon the most sensitive spots: looking at the pictures of my children they did not forget to tell me what they would do to them. It lasted more than three hours.</p> <p>Eventually the lieutenant-colonel, who tried to arouse my sympathy by saying that he was spilling his blood for nothing, looked at his watch and said: \"Let's go, I'll shoot you.\" He took me out of the tent. It was pitch dark.</p> <p>We walked a short distance and then the colonel said: \"Ready or not, here I come.\" Suddenly there was a terrible racket, screeching and flames. The lieutenant-colonel seemed to be gratified that I had bent down from horror. It turned out that he had brought me right up to the Grad mortar at the time it was fired.</p> <p>\"Come on.\" Before long, we came to another flight of steps. \"This is a bathhouse. Take off your clothes.\" When he realised I was not going to oblige, he grew very angry. He kept saying: \"A lieutenant-colonel wants you with all his heart and you, wretched bitch.\"</p> <p>And he added: \"Remember? Ready or not, here I come.\"</p> <p>Another officer, who said he was from the FSB, barged into the bathhouse. The lieutenant-colonel drew the line: \"She doesn't want to take a bath\".</p> <p>The FSB man put the bottles on the table and said: \"Then I'll take her.\" We circled for a long time through the darkness. Finally he again ordered me to climb down the stairs.

      "bodyText": "It all began when 90 families living in several villages in the Vedeno district of southern Chechnya brought their collective complaint to our editorial office. The text was unprecedented: several hundred people were asking to be helped to to move out of Chechnya to any place in Russia, as soon as possible. The reasons: constant hunger, unbearable cold, total isolation from the outside world, lack of medical care - and a special complaint about brutal punitive raids on their villages by the federal forces stationed on the outskirts of the village of Khottuni. The facts were as fantastic as they were glaring. So they had to be verified on the spot. The visit began on February 18. I heard dozens of harrowing accounts from people who had been exposed to torture and maltreatment by Russian troops: stories so horrific that one's hand refused to jot them down. And then I experienced at first hand events in which I myself was the victim. It is as if pictures had come to life to confirm the accounts I had heard. Now the person to whom they shouted: \"Stop! Get a move on!\" was myself. And an official of the FSB - the successor to the KGB - a first lieutenant of tender age, whispered dirty insults in my ear: \"You are one of them...

      "bodyText": "Jazz FM, favoured by 40-something funksters, claims its growing credibility with a younger, more-hip crowd has helped bring a pre-tax profit for the first time in its 10-year history. Hed Kandi, a wholly owned record label producing CDs for what it dubs \"the post-clubbing generation\", has grown faster than expected and was a main contributor to a \u00a360,000 pre-tax profit in the six months to December 31. \"The growth of Hed Kandi has been phenomenal,\" said Jazz FM chief executive Richard Wheatly, pictured right. \"It's aimed at 18 to 30-year-olds who don't go to clubs so much any more but still like bars with DJs. Its popularity has far exceeded our expectations.\" Turnover from the niche label is expected to exceed \u00a33m in 2001. Jazz FM group turnover was \u00a33.9m, up from \u00a32m on the previous period. Listening hours increased by 37%. Guardian Media Group, publisher of The Guardian, is a 19% shareholder in Jazz FM. In common with other commercial radio stations, Jazz FM has been bidding for digital licences in anticipation of listeners eventually upgrading their analogue radios ones. \"We don't envisage seeing any real revenues from them for two or three years but we see them as an important way of increasing our national reach,\" Mr Wheatly said. Shares closed unchanged at 172.5p.",

Since I know Jane to be honest and your diary to be dishonest, I'm pretty sure I know who is telling the truth. I look forward to more lies and distortion from you next week.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Concern mounts for boulevardier Andrew Neil, whose media diary persecution complex deepens by the day. Yesterday's rant in our Media section, in response to the previous week's suggestion that he has blown \u00a3120m of the Barclays' money, was memorable for his whine about \"the most unflattering picture\" of him being chosen (isn't that typical though? Kate, Linda, Jaquetta, Andrew ... perfectionists, the lot of them, and they guard their images like demons). Would you believe an even longer version of this rant appeared in the Scotsman (we'll come to that tomorrow). For now, let's consider Andrew's email to the Telegraph media diary on the crucial question of whether it was then editor Jane Procter's dog Kenzo or Diary pundit Steptoe who used to go to Tatler. \"I have checked with Jane: she assures me it was Rebecca's dog (Steptoe) which came into the office on a regular basis, which the Telegraph wrote about. Since I know Jane to be honest and your diary to be dishonest, I'm pretty sure I know who is telling the truth. I look forward to more lies and distortion from you next week. You're a credit to our profession,\" writes Andrew, concluding with a waspish: \"Who the hell are you, anyway?\" Mayday, Mayday, Andrew Neil to anger management, Andrew Neil to anger ... \u0095 We also share with the Telegraph an interest in Alan Duncan's dealings with the Clinton-pardoned crook Marc Rich. Yesterday my so-called rival carried Little Alan's denial of ever having spoken to Mr Rich, in whose employ he made millions, and so be it.

Mr Barak resigned the post last week, starting what he called a timeout from politics.</p> <p>Mr Sharon's alternative to unity was a rightwing government that would find it harder to revive peace talks. He must form a government by the end of March or face a general election.</p> <p>The outgoing foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, told Labour's central committee meeting he was \"nauseated\" by the spectacle of the party \"slithering on its belly\" to join up with Sharon.</p> <p>\"You are hastening the clinical death of this party,\" he said, addressing supporters of a unity administration.

      "bodyText": "Israel's divided Labour party agreed yesterday to join the country's prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, in the unity government that he hopes will check a Palestinian uprising and chart a new course for Middle East peacemaking. After a stormy session of the 1,600-member central committee, 67% of delegates voted in favour of the move, while 32% voted against, said Labour's secretary general, Raanan Cohen. \"The country has a chance for peace and the party has a chance for renewal,\" Shimon Peres, one-time Labour prime minister, said after the vote. In one of his most fiery speeches in years, Mr Peres tried to rally the centre-left party behind his vision of a political partnership with Mr Sharon, who he said would make \"painful concessions\" for peace. \"The time has come to listen to the people,\" Mr Peres, 77, urged the gathering, raising his voice above the din of hecklers and gesturing from the podium. \"For once and for all, listen to the people.\" Mr Sharon crushed Labour's Ehud Barak in the February 6 prime ministerial election in an indication of deep public dissatisfaction over what many Israelis viewed as over-generous peace proposals offered by the outgoing leader. Mr Sharon is insisting that Palestinians must halt the uprising - which erupted in late September after he visited a hotly contested Jerusalem holy site - before any peace efforts can resume. Mr Peres told his audience in Tel Aviv that the uprising and what he said were future dangers such as Iraq possibly developing a nuclear option, meant that the Labour party could not turn its back on the challenges facing the Jewish state. \"We won't be part of this struggle? Isn't this our country? Do we have another country? We'll sit and wait for what? To make a few more speeches in opposition?\" he asked the audience. Fresh violence in the West Bank yesterday underlined the challenges facing Mr Sharon and the unity government. Israeli troops shot dead a 15-year-old Palestinian during stone-throwing clashes near the city of Ramallah, local hospital sources said. Since the uprising began, 333 Palestinians, 61 Israelis and 13 Israeli Arabs have been killed. Mr Peres said Mr Sharon had offered Labour the key posts of foreign minister and defence chief and agreed to coalition guidelines that enshrined the principle of territorial compromise and honoured past peace accords. \"I am not giving up on Oslo,\" said Mr Peres, who was awarded a Nobel peace prize along with Yasser Arafat and then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin a year after the 1993 interim peace deal was signed. \"I believe they offered us [these cabinet posts] in order to find a common denominator, to extract the country from trouble, to open up a source of light and hope for the future,\" said Mr Peres, who received a standing ovation from the central committee. Mr Peres has said he would like to serve as foreign minister and told the assembly he would be prepared to answer a future call to become Labour's chairman again. Mr Barak resigned the post last week, starting what he called a timeout from politics. Mr Sharon's alternative to unity was a rightwing government that would find it harder to revive peace talks. He must form a government by the end of March or face a general election. The outgoing foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, told Labour's central committee meeting he was \"nauseated\" by the spectacle of the party \"slithering on its belly\" to join up with Sharon. \"You are hastening the clinical death of this party,\" he said, addressing supporters of a unity administration.

When he announced the proposals, the prime minister renewed his pledge to tackle crime and its causes while breaking the \"cycle of reoffending\" which makes the 100,000 most persistent of fenders responsible for about half of all crime. In parliament, the home secretary, Jack Straw, gave the details of the package, which is designed to end the long term decline in detection and conviction rates: they have halved in the past 20 years. A key proposal is the introduction of a \"custody plus\" sentence to replace sentences of 12 months or less passed on 46,000 people each year. Those released would be subjected to intensive supervision, treatment and training, under threat of returning to prison if they failed to comply or offended again.

Liberty called the limited disclosure of previous convictions to juries \"a serious erosion of a key principle of the criminal justice system\". But penal reform groups, such as the Howard League, welcomed the package, describing it as \"the most constructive of this, or the last century\".

      "body": "<p>Crown courts can be intimidating places even for adults. But for the increasing numbers of child defendants, the formality and adversarial nature of the proceedings often make appearing in court an overwhelmingly stressful and frightening experience.</p> <p>Now, leading child law experts, social workers and others working in the criminal justice system say that it is time for a radical overhaul of the way child defendants are dealt with in England and Wales. Some practitioners are also calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised.</p> <p>The call for reforms comes in the wake of the case of a 12-year-old autistic boy accused of killing his brother.</p> <p>The boy, who had been exposed to years of abuse, appeared at Bristol crown court accused of murder although his plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted.</p> <p>Both the judge who heard the case and Lady Helena Kennedy QC, who defended him, have raised doubts over the suitability of the crown court as a means of trying such young defendants.</p> <p>\"There has to be some better way of dealing with children in the criminal justice system,\" says Helena Kennedy. \"There should be a public debate and possibly a commission in the wake of the Bulger case and cases like this one to look at the procedures that we have for dealing with children.</p> <p>\"One possibility would be a High Court judge sitting possibly with a panel. In Scotland they have the children's panels and we could look to other countries to see if they handle these cases more effectively.\"</p> <p>The Bristol case was one of the first involving a child defendant of such a young age on a murder charge since the James Bulger case. As a result of the criticism of the way in which the Bulger case was handled, efforts were made in Bristol to minimise the formality of the courtroom.</p> <p>Lawyers dispensed with their wigs, the public was excluded and the press presence was kept to a minimum. A small part of the court was cordoned off to hear the case and the windows were taped with brown paper to ensure privacy. The boy sat in the main body of the courtroom with his social worker and solicitor rather than the dock, and he was allowed frequent breaks.</p> <p>But even with these attempts to make the courtroom a less intimidating place, Justice Toulson expressed grave doubts over the present system.</p> <p>\"It is certainly a matter for legitimate public discussion how well our present system of criminal justice is attuned to handling cases of this kind.\"</p> <p>Allan Levy QC, a leading child law expert who has campaigned for changes for many years, agrees that the way children are dealt with in criminal cases is unacceptable.</p> <p>\"We are treating them as adults and expecting them to cope with the adult language and adult procedures of the legal system. I would take children out of the crown court and they would not appear there at all. For cases of murder and manslaughter particularly there should be special courts for children with specially trained judges. It is quite wrong to have children appearing in the crown court,'' he says.</p> <p>''The most radical suggestion that I advocate is that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to 14. At 10, we are way out of line with the rest of Europe. We are taking away the protection that childhood should bring.\"</p> <p>Kate Akester, criminal justice director of the human rights organisation, Justice, also agrees that the system is seriously flawed and requires radical re-working.</p> <p>\"Other countries take a more child centred approach.

      "bodyText": "Crown courts can be intimidating places even for adults. But for the increasing numbers of child defendants, the formality and adversarial nature of the proceedings often make appearing in court an overwhelmingly stressful and frightening experience. Now, leading child law experts, social workers and others working in the criminal justice system say that it is time for a radical overhaul of the way child defendants are dealt with in England and Wales. Some practitioners are also calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised. The call for reforms comes in the wake of the case of a 12-year-old autistic boy accused of killing his brother. The boy, who had been exposed to years of abuse, appeared at Bristol crown court accused of murder although his plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted. Both the judge who heard the case and Lady Helena Kennedy QC, who defended him, have raised doubts over the suitability of the crown court as a means of trying such young defendants. \"There has to be some better way of dealing with children in the criminal justice system,\" says Helena Kennedy. \"There should be a public debate and possibly a commission in the wake of the Bulger case and cases like this one to look at the procedures that we have for dealing with children. \"One possibility would be a High Court judge sitting possibly with a panel. In Scotland they have the children's panels and we could look to other countries to see if they handle these cases more effectively.\" The Bristol case was one of the first involving a child defendant of such a young age on a murder charge since the James Bulger case. As a result of the criticism of the way in which the Bulger case was handled, efforts were made in Bristol to minimise the formality of the courtroom. Lawyers dispensed with their wigs, the public was excluded and the press presence was kept to a minimum. A small part of the court was cordoned off to hear the case and the windows were taped with brown paper to ensure privacy. The boy sat in the main body of the courtroom with his social worker and solicitor rather than the dock, and he was allowed frequent breaks. But even with these attempts to make the courtroom a less intimidating place, Justice Toulson expressed grave doubts over the present system. \"It is certainly a matter for legitimate public discussion how well our present system of criminal justice is attuned to handling cases of this kind.\" Allan Levy QC, a leading child law expert who has campaigned for changes for many years, agrees that the way children are dealt with in criminal cases is unacceptable. \"We are treating them as adults and expecting them to cope with the adult language and adult procedures of the legal system. I would take children out of the crown court and they would not appear there at all. For cases of murder and manslaughter particularly there should be special courts for children with specially trained judges. It is quite wrong to have children appearing in the crown court,'' he says. ''The most radical suggestion that I advocate is that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to 14. At 10, we are way out of line with the rest of Europe. We are taking away the protection that childhood should bring.\" Kate Akester, criminal justice director of the human rights organisation, Justice, also agrees that the system is seriously flawed and requires radical re-working. \"Other countries take a more child centred approach. Scotland for instance through the children's hearing system is an example of the way in which young offenders can be diverted out of the criminal process. Children are seen by a panel of three lay people who meet the child in an informal atmosphere, although serious cases like murder, manslaughter, rape and serious assault are dealt with in the adult courts,'' she says. \"There are concerns that the lack of legal advice for children who come before the hearings in Scotland - who are not legally represented in the majority of cases - can leave their human rights infringed. But countries like Scotland, New Zealand, Austria and New South Wales in Australia have an approach which places the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration and such a guiding principle is absent from the system in England and Wales.\" Hilary Cross, spokeswoman for the NSPCC, stresses that the priority in any system is making sure that the child understands what is going on. \"We stress that if young people, whether they are defendants or witnesses, are to receive justice in the courts, they need to understand and follow the legal process that is taking place, they should be given every opportunity to have their story heard, and their specific needs as children should be taken into account,\" she says.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Donald Bradman, who has died aged 92, was the greatest cricketer of the 20th century and the greatest batsman who ever lived. He was also arguably the most famous of all Australians - and among the most influential. Sport played a major role in giving the young nation of Australia global standing, self-belief and a sense of identity. The tragic boxer Les Darcy and the racehorse Phar Lap played a part in this process, but nothing could match the phenomenon of Bradman.</p> <p>His batting statistics are indelible and incredible, incomparably ahead of everyone else who has played the game. Seventy-two other players - including some indifferent ones - have scored more runs in first-class cricket; his totals of Test runs and centuries have been surpassed. But, in Bradman's time, a first-class match in Australia, let alone a Test match, was an event, and then the war intervened.</p> <p>He thus went to the crease in major cricket only 338 times, but in 117 of those innings returned with a century - a strike-rate above one in three, better than twice the ratios achieved by such greats as Jack Hobbs, Len Hutton, Walter Hammond or Denis Compton. His first-class average was 95.14; his nearest rival is on 71.</p> <p>Most famously of all, he went out at the Oval in his last Test innings needing only four to finish with an average of 100, and was bowled second ball by Eric Hollies, of Warwickshire, for a duck. It was as though the gods of cricket had reclaimed the invulnerability they had loaned him - though his final average, 99.94, remains so resonant that the Australian Broadcasting Commission uses it as its post-office box number.</p> <p>In life, as in cricket, he came closer to immortality, outliving his contemporaries, rivals and enemies; there were always plenty of those - despite the near-perfection of his cricket, he was a complex, often troubled, man. Though he achieved everyone else's fantasies, he never seemed to find true fulfilment.</p> <p>Yet he embodied the Australian dream. He was a country boy, born in Cootamundra, in rural New South Wales; his father was a farmer and carpenter - not rich, not poor. None of his schoolfriends lived near him, so, in solitary moments, he invented a game which involved throwing a golf ball at the base of the family water tank; he then had to whack it with a cricket stump. Though the ball fizzed off the tank at high speed and unpredictable angles, by the time he was 10, Bradman could whack it with the stump more often than not.</p> <p>When he was 12, he made a 100 for Bowral high school against Mittagong. For a while, he played more tennis than cricket and seemed to be settling for a career in estate agency. However, when he was 17, Bradman played for Bowral against Wingello, who had the ace leg-spin bowler Bill O'Reilly. Bradman was dropped twice early on off O'Reilly, who got him out first ball when the game resumed the following week. In between, he scored 234.</p> <p>Next match, he scored 300. In October 1926, he was invited to Sydney to practise for the state squad; a year later, aged 19, he was in the New South Wales team, scoring a century on debut. The following year, he scored 1,690 runs, a new Australian record. By November 1928, he was in the Test team, and seared by a match which England won by 678 runs. Bradman made 18 and one, and was dropped from the next game to be replaced by one Dr OE Nothling. He was soon back; no one ever thought of dropping him again.</p> <p>England, at this stage, were in one of their rare intervals of superiority over Australia, and had the world's leading batsman in Walter Hammond. Bradman scored two centuries in the series, one in defeat, one in a consolation victory. No one had the faintest idea that England would not win the Ashes again by fair means for another 24 years, and that one man would be primarily responsible for this.</p> <p>They got an inkling in the first week of 1930, when Bradman scored 452 not out for New South Wales against Queensland. But he was still rated behind another youngster, the more stylish Archie Jackson. Bradman's unclassical backlift would, it was thought, find him out on soft English wickets. In the event, Jackson failed in England (he died of TB three years later) and Bradman's tour was a triumphal procession.</p> <p>It might be easy to imagine Bradman from this distance as a dull and mechanical batsman, something of a Geoffrey Boycott. In fact, he scored his runs at a phenomenal rate; the 452 came in 415 minutes, barely imaginable today. When he got to England, the style became more firmly established. It was almost metronomic, starting with the push for one first ball.</p> <p>He was the master of timing; his eye was so extraordinary that he could make up his mind what shot to play a micro-second later than anyone else; and his judgment was so impeccable that the decision was almost always right. He eliminated the risk that comes from lofting the ball, and hardly ever hit a six in consequence.</p> <p>His batting was both intuitive and intellectual; as Neville Cardus said, he was that rare and devastating combination, \"a genius with an eye for business\". A Bradman innings was not as beautiful as one by Trumper or Woolley or Jackson, but it was awesome, and he drew unprecedented crowds from people just anxious to say they saw one.</p> <p>In England in 1930, he became a colossus. He began by inaugurating his tradition of an opening double-century at Worcester, and hit 1,000 runs before the end of May. In the five-match Ashes series, he scored 974, 69 more than the record set by Hammond 18 months earlier: 254 at Lord's, 338 at Leeds, 232 at the Oval. At Leeds, he made 309 in a day; a modern Test batsman does well to score a century in that time. Cardus insisted that essentially this was a triumph for cricketing orthodoxy: \"He is a purist in a hurry: he administers the orthodox in loud and apostolic knocks.\"</p> <p>Hammond was displaced completely as the world's batting champion, and there are those who argue that he never recovered as a cricketer or as a man. There have been moments when other cricketers - Denis Compton in 1947, Brian Lara in 1995 - have been almost as dominating, and perhaps even more exciting. But for Bradman, this was just the beginning.</p> <p>He returned to Australia a hero, and progressed east from Fremantle by train to be greeted rapturously at every railway halt along the Nullarbor Plain. His team-mates, meanwhile, were making the transcontinental journey by sea, and growing ever more jealous. Though Bradman was assiduous at giving credit where it was due, the classic cricket team dichotomy between the individual hero and the collective was now in place. Inevitably also, skirmishing began with the Australian cricketing authorities, who fined him \u00a350 for writing a book about the tour.</p> <p>These battle lines remained in place throughout the 1930s, and, in 1931, he came close to accepting an offer to play Lancashire League cricket for Accrington. There was insufficient money in cricket to provide the income his celebrity demanded, and a hasty sponsorship deal had to be cobbled together. The wicket was made slightly higher and wider in 1930-31; still Bradman scored prodigiously with further double centuries against the West Indies and South Africa. Some in England thought they had spotted a weakness in him against top-class wrist-spin. But as England came to Australia in 1932-33, their new captain, Douglas Jardine, had other plans.</p> <p>Thus began the most notorious Test series of all time, in which England regained the Ashes by unleashing their fast bowlers to bowl bouncers at the Australians, with a field (now illegal) concentrated behind the stumps on the leg-side; this meant the batsmen had no alternative but to fend the ball to the fieldsmen, or get hurt. Imperialist arrogance, and poor reporting of the tour, ensured that the English establishment and public were slow to realise the sheer degeneracy of this strategy. The initial reaction was that the Australians were whingeing, and that a way had been found to beat them again and blunt Bradman at last. Even in these circumstances, he averaged nearly 57.</p> <p>When bodyline was repudiated, and normality restored, Bradman resumed his un troubled progress. He was a fraction less domineering in the remaining three Ashes series of the decade, but only a fraction. In 1934, he scored another triple-century in the Leeds Test; in 1936-37, he led Australia back from 2-0 down with triumphant performances in the last three matches; in 1938, as captain, he again scored 1,000 runs in May, and averaged more than 100 throughout.</p> <p>It should have been the happiest, as well as the most triumphant, decade any sports- man has ever had. It was never quite like that. After the 1934 tour, Bradman was taken ill with acute appendicitis and peritonitis; he missed the 1934-35 season while recuperating. He moved from New South Wales to South Australia to accept an offer from a cricket-loving stockbroker (later jailed for fraud), which left some ill-feeling. Even the travelling got to him; he was seasick and later airsick.</p> <p>And the tensions within the Australian team worsened. Bradman, a pernickety, near-teetotal Protestant (religion mattered in 1930s Australia) with a Calvinist work ethic, was not a natural soulmate of the witty, happy-go-lucky, left-leaning Roman Catholics like O'Reilly and Fingleton, both of them later journalists with a waspish turn of phrase, often used against Bradman. \"Fingleton,\" Bradman complained later, \"conducted a vendetta against me all his life.\"</p> <p>Moreover, though his marriage to Jessie was a triumph - and was to remain so for 65 years until her death in 1997 - the Bradmans' eldest son was to live for only a few hours; their daughter, Shirley, developed cerebral palsy; and their surviving son, John, had polio as a child. He pulled through, but was often estranged from his father later. Son and daughter survive their father.</p> <p>The whispering increased after 1939, when cricket became less relevant. While other Australians had daredevil wars, Bradman - bizarrely enough - was declared to have defective eyesight, and spent the time in Adelaide. He was apparently often unwell, and there was some doubt that he would ever return to play for Australia in the hastily-arranged series of 1946-47.</p> <p>He did appear, though, and carried on where he left off, striding to 187 in the first postwar Test, more than England made in either innings, but only after refusing to walk for what England were certain was a perfectly fair slip catch by Jack Ikin when he had 28. In the next game, he scored 234. And so on. In 1948, pushing 40, he came back to England for his farewell tour.</p> <p>By now, he seemed a mellower figure, willing to return the adulation of the crowds. His enemies in the dressing room had retired; the newer generation were less inclined to question his deification; and, when cricketing mortality finally seized him at the Oval, it was possible to see it in very human terms.</p> <p>John Arlott was commentating. \"I wonder if you see a ball very clearly on your last Test in England, on a ground where you've played out some of the biggest cricket of your life, and when the opposing team has just stood round you and given you three cheers, and the crowd had clapped you all the wicket . . . I wonder if you really see the ball at all.\" But, came the cynical riposte: if Bradman had a tear in his eye, it was for the first time.</p> <p>He was knighted in 1949, then slipped easily into the role of cricketing elder statesman. He gave up stockbroking and became a selector and administrator, dealing firmly with the throwing crisis that convulsed the game at the end of the 1950s. He played golf, off scratch (of course), remaining rooted all the time to his marriage and suburban home in Adelaide.</p> <p>With elaborate courtesy, Bradman replied personally to all his correspondents into his 90s. But the answer was nearly always \"No\", if it was a request for an interview. He spoke about bodyline in 1983, the 50th anniversary. After that came near-total silence. Eventually, he stopped going to the Adelaide Oval, and became reclusive, indeed a bit of a curmudgeon, boycotting the celebrations laid on for his own 90th birthday.</p> <p>However, when a Wisden panel in 2000 voted him the cricketer of the century, with 100 votes out of 100, he issued a statement of delight. His reputation as a cricketer has never been questioned; as a man, he remains enigmatic. Though his fame extended only to the cricketing countries, within its limits it far exceeded the transient public obsessiveness with a Gascoigne or a Beckham and, in his own buttoned-up way, Bradman found it desperately hard to cope.</p> <p>\"You can't tell youngsters today of the attraction of the fellow,\" said one of his opponents, the England bowler Bill Bowes in 1983. \"I mean, business used to stop in the town when Bradman was playing and likely to go in - all the offices closed, the shops closed; everybody went up to see him play.\" Our Don Bradman was a song of the 1930s. But he was always his Don Bradman.</p> <p>Donald George Bradman, cricketer, born August 27 1908; died February 25 2001</p>",

John Arlott was commentating. \"I wonder if you see a ball very clearly on your last Test in England, on a ground where you've played out some of the biggest cricket of your life, and when the opposing team has just stood round you and given you three cheers, and the crowd had clapped you all the wicket . . . I wonder if you really see the ball at all.\" But, came the cynical riposte: if Bradman had a tear in his eye, it was for the first time. He was knighted in 1949, then slipped easily into the role of cricketing elder statesman. He gave up stockbroking and became a selector and administrator, dealing firmly with the throwing crisis that convulsed the game at the end of the 1950s. He played golf, off scratch (of course), remaining rooted all the time to his marriage and suburban home in Adelaide. With elaborate courtesy, Bradman replied personally to all his correspondents into his 90s. But the answer was nearly always \"No\", if it was a request for an interview. He spoke about bodyline in 1983, the 50th anniversary. After that came near-total silence. Eventually, he stopped going to the Adelaide Oval, and became reclusive, indeed a bit of a curmudgeon, boycotting the celebrations laid on for his own 90th birthday. However, when a Wisden panel in 2000 voted him the cricketer of the century, with 100 votes out of 100, he issued a statement of delight. His reputation as a cricketer has never been questioned; as a man, he remains enigmatic. Though his fame extended only to the cricketing countries, within its limits it far exceeded the transient public obsessiveness with a Gascoigne or a Beckham and, in his own buttoned-up way, Bradman found it desperately hard to cope. \"You can't tell youngsters today of the attraction of the fellow,\" said one of his opponents, the England bowler Bill Bowes in 1983. \"I mean, business used to stop in the town when Bradman was playing and likely to go in - all the offices closed, the shops closed; everybody went up to see him play.\" Our Don Bradman was a song of the 1930s. But he was always his Don Bradman. Donald George Bradman, cricketer, born August 27 1908; died February 25 2001",

There she was, hoping to hand in her notice as leader of the House of Lords and minister for women and tiptoe out of the back door with as little fuss as possible - and then those nasty busybodies at the Equal Opportunities Commission complete a survey trumpeting the failure of her women's unit. To be fair, the findings, published today, are as much an indictment of New Labour as they are of the unit it created to look after women's interests: in terms of equal pay and equal opportunities, Britain is the most sexist place to work in Europe. </p> <p>Red faces all around. The party that had raised such hopes and manufactured such hype about its pro-women agenda - remember all the boasts about more female MPs than ever before? The ground-breaking, breastfeeding Blair babes? - will now enter the general election with a set of statistics that will further alienate female voters, a million of whom say they've gone off the government. </p> <p>The picture is bleak indeed. If you care about how your wage packet compares with the man who does the same job as you, you're better off in France, Germany or even Portugal. The wage gap in these countries is less than in Britain - where a woman working full time earns just 82% of her male colleague's salary. (For a part-time female worker that sinks to 60%.) If you care about paid maternity leave, you'd better up sticks and move to Italy (where a mother gets five months' paid leave) or Finland (nine months, as well as 42 days for paternity leave); in Britain, you get a paltry 18 weeks. Add to this poor childcare provision and, in predominantly female professions such as nursing, an average pay of 6% less than overall average male earnings in the UK, and you can see why the European Council of Ministers told the UK to get down to work on closing the pay gap. </p> <p>They have their work cut out for them. Thirty years since the Equal Pay Act was passed, women find the workplace as inimical as the factory caricatured in Charlie Chaplin's Mod ern Times. Talk to staff at the EOC, and they can name endless cases of women who have had to take their employers to court to receive fair treatment. Take Dr Lorna Chessum, a female lecturer at Leicester's De Montfort University, who discovered she had been appointed on a lower salary - \u00a36,000 less - than a similarly qualified male colleague. She received \u00a310,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement in September 2000. </p> <p>Then there's Doreen McManus, who worked as a payroll administrator for Rentokil. She claimed that over three years she did the same work as a male colleague, whom she trained, and who was paid \u00a33,000 more than her. She took the matter up with her employer, who agreed to review her pay. Her salary was increased - but she was still earning less than her colleague. She lodged an equal pay claim and Rentokil settled the case, paying her \u00a310,500 compensation. </p> <p>Two small victories in a war we thought was won long ago. A war in which we cannot count on either government or employer as an ally. Jill Rubery, as the co ordinator of the European Commission's expert group on gender and equality, was present when the commission, having seen the UK's National Action Plan for Employment last year, publicly reprimanded the country for its appalling employment figures. \"Immediately, our civil servants started to rubbish the data as insufficient and emphasise the high employment rate we have for women - which is well above the 60% target by 2010 set in Lisbon in 1999.\" The spin machine is likely to go into overdrive after the EOC survey, too, despite its impressive credentials: the research was carried out by the NOP group in the summer last year. It involved a telephone survey of senior human resource managers in 301 organisations with at least 200 employees; telephone interviews with national trade union officials; and in-depth case-study research in 21 selected organisations. </p> <p>While government apologists may spin against the EOC survey for painting too gloomy a picture of the working woman's lot, critics of the government suspect that the survey in fact lets the government off lightly. Mary Davis, who heads the Centre for Trade Union Studies at the University of North London, argues: \"Industry by industry, the gender pay gap has actually widened since 1997. I see no evidence, apart from the introduction of the national minimum wage, to support the view that we are wit nessing a narrowing of the gap. Among working-class women, certainly, things have got worse. If you're living in a textile town, for instance, with the industry bottoming out beneath your feet, you are far poorer than before.\" </p> <p>Rubery, who with Damian Grimshaw carried out the research for the EOC, feels that even some of the state's poverty-busting initiatives have had a negative impact on women's wages. The working families tax credit, for example, \"contradicted the equal-pay ethos by trapping the second income-earner in a low- paying job\". Moreover, as both Davis and Rubery point out, a government that believes that any regulation hinders the market, and has abdicated all responsibility for pay structure, cannot intervene in the one area that most affects the gender pay gap. </p> <p>The market, indeed, has become a fig leaf behind which employers can hide discrimination: you can get away with paying Jane less than Joe by signing them up to individualised contracts. There are a million weasel words that allow you to claim that what she is doing is not exactly the same as what he does. Equally, there are many ways of explaining away why promotion keeps eluding her. </p> <p>The trade unions, once the battering rams for victims of unfair treatment at work, have lost their bite. Collective bargaining has declined in recent years; today, less than one in three workplaces is covered by it. Meanwhile, employer accountability has grown ever more nebulous. In an increasing number of situations, there is no single, clear-cut employer - as is the case when work is subcontracted, or joint ventures or partnerships operate. This makes it difficult to uphold legislationbased on \"comparable work for the same employer\". The fragmentation of the public sector, through the contracting out of services to the private sector, also contributes to the difficulty in monitoring the wage differential. Not surprisingly, this state of affairs gets the thumbs up from employers - 93% of those who took part in the EOC survey cheerfully believed their pay systems were fair. </p> <p>Those of us who feel that if Jane and Joe carry out the same work they should bring home the same pay packet will simply have to provide fodder for the EOC's case studies.

Because work, you must understand, is war. Think about it: the death-ravaged trenches of the Somme; your office. See? Consider Patton on Leadership (Prentice Hall), a big, manly, hard-backed, thick-skinned beast of a book in which workplace expert Alan Axelrod decodes the sayings of the great WW2 general. To the uninitiated, Patton's utterances - \"Hold the enemy by the nose and kick him in the pants!\" or \"I am the best damn ass-kicker in the US Army!\" - might seem like the rantings of a power-drunk lunatic. But no: the former is really a helpful \"deploy your resources so you control the situation\". As for ass-kicking: \"Subsitute a milder noun - perhaps 'motivator',\" writes Axelrod, \"and you have a goal to which any manager might aspire.\" </p> <p>Debunker thumbed breathlessly through the pages for a few of Patton's other managerial practices. But where was his famously sensitive handling of staff sickness (slapping a shell-shocked soldier in hospital to motivate him)? Or his clever way with nepotism and human resource management (sacrificing lives in order to free his son-in-law from a PoW camp)? Or his inability to prevent himself unleashing tirades of profanities on his underlings? Inexplicably, they have all gone Awol. </p> <p>Email Work at <a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Puts up another table: two crates, a piece of wood and a stretch of fake grass. 8:35: Cauliflowers, more beans, sprouts, broccoli. 8:42: Another table for courgettes, strawberry punnets and spring onions. 8:44: Arranges 11 bunches of bananas. 8:46: Man in checked trousers buys a pear. \"That your breakfast, eh?\" 8:47: Hangs up six bunches of bananas on hooks above till. 8:52: Cuts cucumber in half. Sorts onions. \"Every day we have to do this.\" 9:00: Woman in blue puffa jacket buys bunch of bananas. \"One ten.\" 9:02: Man in cord jacket buys broccoli and banana. He pauses, then decides to buy 1lb of rhubarb, some onions, and fennel. And 1lb of broad beans. Man says he cannot believe they have broad beans. 9:20: Drinks cup of Oxo. 9:23: Burglar alarm goes off across the road at William Hill. 9:53: Woman buys strawberries. 10:00: Marcus's wife Lorraine arrives to help. They met at the stall. \"She was going to the pie and mash shop and I just started talking to her.\" 11.23: \"People don't come out now til about 12 o'clock. You can see how many shops are closed down there.\" 11:53: Man comes to buy grapes. \"One thirty. D'you want a bag for it?\" 12:15: Butcher arrives for some eggs. \"'Ello, butcher.\" 12:18: \"I'm still working on pounds. I had to buy scales to say kilos. The old people don't understand kilos.\" 12:30: Lunch. \"You just work and if you're hungry you eat.\" 1:20: Waits for customers. \"There's odd passing trade, but mainly regulars. Some come from Croydon to get their pie and mash.\" 2:16: \"That's the thing with stalls now, everyone likes to help themselves. It's come from abroad, they've brought it with them. We used to have signs saying \"Do Not Touch'. If someone touched an apple they'd chop your hand off. But that's a thing of the past.\" 2:24: Waves to a friend. 3:33: Man with moustache buys tomatoes. \"Thank you very much.\" 4:07: \"There aren't seasons now. The runner beans are from Zimbabwe, the broad beans are from Italy.\" 5:00: Starts to pack up. \"I used to peg it up here after school, on my bike, to help my dad clear up. It's a dying trade now, really. My son won't take it over. He's 18 and a landscape gardener. Maybe my daughter will.\" 5:30 Goes home. Lorraine cooks dinner - \"hopefully a roast\".

And, let's face it, they probably are. But ooh, wouldn't it be thrilling for the jetlagged executive in question if he could at least pretend that they were top-secret documents that must be protected from enemy eyes at all costs? That, surely, must be the ego-boosting motivation behind a sudden new spate of gadgets designed to combat the \"problem\" of corporate espionage on business flights - such as 3M's new privacy filter, which renders your screen invisible to nosy neighbours. There's no sign as yet of any product designed to block signals from the chip that they planted in your brain to broadcast your thoughts to the CIA. But it's surely only a matter of time. Debunker: General manager There's something about a soldier, it seems, that catapults management gurus further than usual into the realms of higher meaninglessness. Because work, you must understand, is war. Think about it: the death-ravaged trenches of the Somme; your office. See? Consider Patton on Leadership (Prentice Hall), a big, manly, hard-backed, thick-skinned beast of a book in which workplace expert Alan Axelrod decodes the sayings of the great WW2 general. To the uninitiated, Patton's utterances - \"Hold the enemy by the nose and kick him in the pants!\" or \"I am the best damn ass-kicker in the US Army!\" - might seem like the rantings of a power-drunk lunatic. But no: the former is really a helpful \"deploy your resources so you control the situation\". As for ass-kicking: \"Subsitute a milder noun - perhaps 'motivator',\" writes Axelrod, \"and you have a goal to which any manager might aspire.\" Debunker thumbed breathlessly through the pages for a few of Patton's other managerial practices. But where was his famously sensitive handling of staff sickness (slapping a shell-shocked soldier in hospital to motivate him)? Or his clever way with nepotism and human resource management (sacrificing lives in order to free his son-in-law from a PoW camp)? Or his inability to prevent himself unleashing tirades of profanities on his underlings? Inexplicably, they have all gone Awol. Email Work at work@theguardian.com",

A quotation from Emily Dickinson (\"Done with the compass/ Done with the chart\") provides the title of the first movement, and the music opens with an epic stillness. Hardenberger creates primeval melodies from the inchoate musical space that surrounds him. This sense of timelessness is focused in a long solo for cow-horn, an ancestor of the present-day trumpet. It's as if Gruber is composing the creation myth of an instrument and a repertoire. </p> <p>The second movement, Gone Dancing, dispels the serenity of the first, with music of vibrantly eclectic energy. Gruber makes references to 1940s show-tunes and raucous folk melodies, but he creates a scintillating synthesis of these with his own style. The piece ends with a sound, and an image, that returns the trumpet soloist to the cosmic calm of the opening. Hardenberger walks to the piano and plays a single note that resonates, creating a shimmering aura of sound. His performance is even more impressive than it was at the work's premiere, and he projects the extraordinary technical challenges of Gruber's music with conviction. </p> <p>Shostakovich's 15th was his last symphony, and it's an appropriately ambiguous work to cap one of the most disturbing series of symphonies ever written. The music is a bizarre mix of references, allusions and images. Quotations from Rossini (the William Tell Overture) and from Wagner (a motive from the Ring cycle) protrude from the first and last movements, while the slow movement juxtaposes everything from a long cello solo to funereal brass chords and an eerie vibraphone melody. Is this nihilistic deconstruction, or a benign \"toy-shop at night\", as Shostakovich himself described it? </p> <p>Slatkin's performance avoids the issue. He and the BBCSO play the piece as an attractive succession of individual moments to be knitted together in the audience's imagination. But hearing the work simply as a musical structure is a hollow experience: from the glitter of the opening movement to the emptiness of the final chord, there seems to be only surface and superficiality. </p> <p>Beside the dazzling complexities of Shostakovich and Gruber, Slatkin's earlier performance of Haydn's Symphony No 99 is superfluous.

The precise nature of the problem at HSBC was unclear last night. </p> <p>One customer was told that the bank's back-up systems, which usually run between 1am and 2am, had inadvertently begun operating mid-morning. According to this source, when the back-up system was switched off, it appeared to re-start automatically and could not be stopped. HSBC was unable to confirm this sequence of events last night, or when bank accounts had become inoperable, or when customer information would be available again. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"HSBC Bank identified a data management problem today which meant that customers were unable to access account information. All customers are still able to withdraw cash from ATMs (cash machines) and branches\". </p> <p>He insisted that no customer information had been lost. \"We apologise for the inconvenience and are working as hard a possible to solve the problem,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 8m customers of HSBC were denied information about their accounts yesterday as the high street bank suffered a computer failure on the day it announced record profits of \u00a37bn. The embarrassing glitch, which had still not been rectified last night, meant that people calling the bank's customer hotline were either unable to get through or told that they could not receive information about their account. Customers were unable to check whether payments, such as salaries, had gone into the accounts or whether withdrawals had gone out. Callers to First Direct, HSBC's telephone bank, were also told that they could not receive in formation about their accounts because of \"a computer breakdown\". Customers trying to access such information online, through HSBC's internet service, said they encountered similar difficulties accessing account details. Industry experts said that for a computer difficulty to be so prolonged and to be nationwide was \"very rare\". The precise nature of the problem at HSBC was unclear last night. One customer was told that the bank's back-up systems, which usually run between 1am and 2am, had inadvertently begun operating mid-morning. According to this source, when the back-up system was switched off, it appeared to re-start automatically and could not be stopped. HSBC was unable to confirm this sequence of events last night, or when bank accounts had become inoperable, or when customer information would be available again. A spokesman said: \"HSBC Bank identified a data management problem today which meant that customers were unable to access account information. All customers are still able to withdraw cash from ATMs (cash machines) and branches\". He insisted that no customer information had been lost. \"We apologise for the inconvenience and are working as hard a possible to solve the problem,\" he said.",

Anyone brave enough to utter a word as the purveyors of dark waltzes do their melancholic thing is met with a steely stare and a request to be quiet. Very, very quiet. </p> <p>That admiration has always been there for the Nottingham band. Critics have fawned, and it was obligatory for any indie fan in the 1990s to name-check Tindersticks among their favourites. Limited-edition singles on a variety of small labels added to the must-have cool. </p> <p>Tindersticks exist to create beauty out of heartbreak, verbalising emotions and tapping into half-remembered memories. They are the sound of late-night reflections, their shuffling drums and mournful vocals conjuring up images of seaside towns in winter. It's end-of-the-pier music for star-crossed lovers with nicotine-stained fingers. But reality creeps in sometimes. Frontman Stuart Staples sits forward on his stool, acoustic guitar in hand, and it all goes a bit wrong. \"I've fucking fucked up the words already,\" he says, staring at his guitar forlornly before sharply beginning again. </p> <p>Immaculate in denim jacket and patterned shirt - with the top three buttons undone, revealing a hint of white vest underneath - Staples combines an Elvis sheen with a Nick Cave intensity. He is hypnotic, caressing the microphone, his vocals, full of smoke and regret, resonating against a mellow backing. The poetic lyrics are obscured by his mumbling delivery and he draws us in largely by mood. His eyes closed, Staples is far away, his body jolting and twisting to Blood, like Ian Curtis on tranquillisers. </p> <p>Each song has an innate sadness, but this isn't music to drown in. Dickon Hinchliffe's violin provides an uplifting juxtaposition to Staples's sighing phrases. The gentle rhythm of Nectar allows us space to think before Can Our Love adds some soul to the sadness, summoning up the warmth and tenderness of the classic I'd Rather Go Blind before we're back in bedsit- blues territory with a guitar squelch. It's this ability to enjoy one-song relationships with many genres that keeps Tindersticks out of the indie ghetto - they refuse to be defined. </p> <p>Marbles is a country-and- western soundtrack made by Duane Eddy, the rock and guitar adding drama to the fast, nagging drums. And throughout the set the songs build in tension. Staples's vocals grow more determined and passionate, and the band ups the tempo and crescendos before the emotion drains away. Obscurity can be picturesque after all.</p>",

Holl seemed to be having an off night. During the first half of the concert he repeatedly cleared his throat as if suffering from a cold. There is little doubt as to the quality of his voice, a huge, dark sound with a wide-ranging palette of tonal colouring, but there were moments of unwieldiness and suspect intonation. Only after the interval did he seem to settle down. Most of the time, Holl sings with his eyes shut or downcast, as if lost in a world of meditation, and you can't help feeling you're being kept at arm's length. </p> <p>His programme consisted of Schumann at his most depressive, culminating in the famous Eichendorff Liederkreis, with its images of exile and existential isolation. It was here that Holl finally struck form, generating a palpable sense of unease. The opening song, In der Fremde, was plangently introverted. The weird confrontation between the narrator and the seductive, destructive Lorelei opened up an abyss of sexual terror. With pianist Roger Vignoles at his superlative best, Auf einer Burg created an eerie resonance that seemed to echo through vast spaces. The closing song, Fr\u00fchlingsnacht, far from implying emotional release from nightmare, hinted at mania. </p> <p>Holl's variability in the first half of the concert was disquieting, however, particularly since he opted for two little-known sequences of songs, one of which is a masterpiece that deserves to be heard more often. This is the Lenau-Lieder, written in 1850 as Schumann's response to the news of the death of the poet Nikolaus Lenau. The sequence opens in a mood of deceptive optimism, with the depiction of a blacksmith cheerily forging a horseshoe. The mood gradually darkens until images of human mortality become omnipresent, before a sudden shift in gear leads to Schumann's contemplation of Lenau's soul being wafted heavenward. Though it ranks with other Lenau-inspired works by Liszt and Strauss, its impact here was intermittent. </p> <p>Much the same can be said of Holl's performance of the Harfenspieler-Lieder, based on sections of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister. Moments of terror and tragic intensity were offset by stretches in which Holl's vocal unease was more than once apparent.</p>",
