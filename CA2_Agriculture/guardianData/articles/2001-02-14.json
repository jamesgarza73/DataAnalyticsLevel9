He volleyed home from six yards in the 72nd minute after Brian McBride had flicked on Gary Parkinson's corner. The club record \u00a31.5m Preston's manager Dave Moyes invested in Healy looked like sound business as the Ulsterman's effort nudged his side closer to the play-off zone. It extended Preston's recent winning run to three matches and their bleak mid-winter run of five consecutive defeats must have seemed a distant memory. Stockport, though, continue to hover dangerously above the relegation zone despite having lost only three times 18 games - including cup matches. Moyes's decision to field three strikers in their previous two matches had seen North End collect the full six points and the Scotsman decided to keep faith with same line-up.

But a mistake by Flynn presented Healy with a chance in the 21st minute. He failed to intercept a through pass from the United States international McBride and Healy raced clear only to be denied by Stockport's goalkeeper Lee Jones who advanced rapidly to claim the ball.

Cleared by Valencia, allowing Stam to have a crack from distance. Not surprisingly he misses.<br> <strong>68</strong> Lots of pressure from Valencia.

Still lots of movement from both teams but no clear threats on goal for several minutes.<br> <strong>82</strong> United corner after Sheringham falls foul of the wet conditions on the by-line and is challenged when trying to cross. Giggs takes, comes to nothing. <br> <strong>84</strong> Cole claims a penalty under pressure from Ayala in the Valencia area.<br> <strong>85 Substitution</strong> Solskjaer on for Cole.<br> <strong>86</strong> Sheringham plays it over the top to Solskjaer on-side. Solskjaer cuts inside and passes to Keane but Carboni makes a crucial challenge just outside the six-yard box to keep Valencia in the game.<br> <strong>89 Booking</strong> Ayala.<br> <strong>90</strong> Four extra minutes to play. Both teams chasing things down as if their lives depended on it. No time on the ball for anyone in the closing stages. Full-time. <strong>Valencia 0 - 0 Man Utd</strong>. Great game with United owing their point in large part to Stam and Brown at the back. If United can beat Valencia next week at Old Trafford then they are through to the quarter-finals.</p>",

United eventually get it clear. 33 Scholes unlucky to see his rocket of a half-volley from 25 yards fly wide. 37 Never one to turn down an invitation to shoot, Scholes has another crack from distance - well wide. 41 United free-kick from 30 yards out. Beckham takes and sends it into the crowd. 43 Silvestre drifts the ball in towards Cole in the Valancia area, but the United striker is muscled off the ball by Pellegrino. 44 Stam gives away to Carew; he delivers a great cross but no one is there to meet it for Valencia. Booking Pellegrino for a foul on Sheringham. 45 United finish the half on the attack. Pellegrino slices at a Beckham cross from the right before the ref blows for half-time. 46 Important challenge by Baraca stops Sheringham getting away 30 yards out . Beckham takes the free-kick - goes for a corner. Everyone misses it; United throw before Valencia finally clear. 49 United doing a good job of pinning Valencia back, with Brown the man making many of the telling challenges to stop Valencia coming forward. 54 Booking Silvestre for upending Carew wide on the right. Mendieta's free-kick manages to miss everyone in the United area. 55 Cole breaks down the left and plays in Giggs who then tries to pull the ball back for the return... shame Cole didn't read it. 57 Barthez, having beaten former team-mate Angloma with his left foot some 10 minutes earlier, now shows Kily what he can do with his right by lifting the ball over him and into safety. 59 Aimar and Mendieta link up well on the edge of the United area to play in Kily, who is unlucky to be called offside. 62 Concerted pressure from Valencia results in a corner after Kily shoots from 25 yards. Mendieta takes but comes to nothing. 63 Ayala fouls Giggs on the left of the Valencia area. Giggs takes as the ref narrowly avoids being struck by a missile. Cleared by Valencia, allowing Stam to have a crack from distance. Not surprisingly he misses. 68 Lots of pressure from Valencia. Barthez on top of it mostly, but needs Stam to help him out with the lively Carew. 70 Great save by Barthez from Kily in the six-yard box but no one there for the rebound. 71 Booking Stam for a foul on Aimar. 72 Valencia keep on coming - corner, cleared by a United side now pushed well back into their own half. 73 Mendieta shoots with his right from just outside the area - fortunately for United it's straight at Barthez. 75 Substitutions Alonso on for Carew. Butt on for Beckham. 80 Baraca makes a crucial intervention to prevent Sheringham shooting from a Silvestre cut-back in the Valencia area. Still lots of movement from both teams but no clear threats on goal for several minutes. 82 United corner after Sheringham falls foul of the wet conditions on the by-line and is challenged when trying to cross. Giggs takes, comes to nothing. 84 Cole claims a penalty under pressure from Ayala in the Valencia area. 85 Substitution Solskjaer on for Cole. 86 Sheringham plays it over the top to Solskjaer on-side. Solskjaer cuts inside and passes to Keane but Carboni makes a crucial challenge just outside the six-yard box to keep Valencia in the game. 89 Booking Ayala. 90 Four extra minutes to play. Both teams chasing things down as if their lives depended on it. No time on the ball for anyone in the closing stages. Full-time. Valencia 0 - 0 Man Utd. Great game with United owing their point in large part to Stam and Brown at the back. If United can beat Valencia next week at Old Trafford then they are through to the quarter-finals.",

      "bodyText": "Matthew Bannister has said his new dance music talent venture will aim to get involved in radio and TV programming. Mr Bannister, who is joining Trust the DJ as chief executive and chairman, said the firm \"could either work with existing broadcasters or in the future run our own radio and TV operation\". \"There will be opportunities for syndicating radio output both in the UK and overseas,\" he added. But Mr Bannister said his first priority at Trust the DJ will be to establish its core business of talent management, running websites for DJ clients and launching a record label specialising in dance music. \"We're looking to develop a new internet offering,\" added Mr Bannister. \"I don't think there's anywhere at the moment where you can visit 60 DJs' personal websites and buy exclusive mixes of their music.\" \"Each DJ will have their top 20 recommendations that you will be able to buy through us, on vinyl or CD.\" He added that the outfit would initially operate the \"traditional internet model - you order a record online and we'll send it to you\". But in the future, once the current copyright issues surrounding Napster and online music distribution, Trust the DJ would also look to \"move to the download model\", he said. Mr Bannister added that the company would also use the internet to expand its business outside the UK, with the US the number one priority. \"Dance music maybe peaking here in the UK, but there's a major opportunity in the US, which may be 10 years behind us,\" he said. \"Through the internet you can connect with fans and build from the ground up, without imposing a big corporate model.\" Mr Bannister added that for some clients Trust the DJ would be agent, website producer and record label. But in other cases the outfit may just produce a DJs website. Lynn Cosgrove, who co-founded Trust the DJ with Tammy Smulders before approaching Mr Bannister, said: \"We went for Matthew because we knew he was somebody with a great track record in management and a great reputation for working with talent.\" Mr Bannister added: \"When I left the BBC I said I wanted to get out of the world corporate broadcasting and get back to a creative business.\" Relevant story Feb 14: Bannister returns",

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary watchdog should be on permanent standby to investigate breaches of the ministerial code of conduct, according to an influential House of Commons select committee. The recommendation to set up an independent investigator comes in the wake of the Hinduja passport scandal which saw Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson resign over a disputed telephone call. Now the select committee on public administration has called for the parliamentary ombudsman - who currently investigates complaints against MPs - to scrutinize alleged breaches of the ministerial code. At the moment any complaint is looked into by the cabinet secretary or other senior civil servants. The aim of the recommendation, which will be sent to the prime minister, is to ensure fairness to ministers under strong political pressure to resign after allegations of wrongdoing - either from the press or political opponents. But the scheme has run into immediate opposition from Lord Neill, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, who claimed the plan would turn into a \"political football.\" He said \"Some complaints will be good, some bona fide, some politically motivated, and the cry will go up to refer this to the standing investigator. \"I think it will turn the thing into a political football.\" The ministerial code of conduct is an informal collection of guidelines that have evolved over more than 50 years, covering general standards for ministerial conduct. The proposal, which is unlikely to garner much support from Downing Street, would also see the prime minister face an annual question time session from the chairmen of the various Commons select committees. The recommendations will give fresh succour to backbench MP Peter Mandelson, who is trying to clear his name after resigning in what friends describe as a \"kangaroo court\" as pressure from the media mounted over discrepencies in his account of his handling of the Hinduja passport affair. The former Northern Ireland secretary resigned on January 24th after a tense meeting with the prime minister, his press secretary Alastair Campbell and Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary.",

Following an earlier announcement that its redundant employees were being targetted to fill 4,000 new jobs created by telecoms company EXi Telecoms, Corus has now decided to go ahead with the statutory 90-day consultation process before it makes any cuts. The company will meet union officials again in a month's time after looking in detail at a plan presented by unions at a meeting in London. Michael Leahy, general secretary of the iron and steel trades confederation, said he was hopeful that progress could be achieved.

The company is aiming to recruit other manufacturing workers across the country over the next two years under a huge programme to upgrade infrastructure for the booming sector.

Teesside steelworker Matthew Lodge, his wife Dorothy and children Lucy and Matthew were handing over the petition to Corus executives at the company's London head office. Union leaders will arrive at the same offices later today for last-ditch talks with Corus after spending the last two weeks drawing up a detailed rescue package. \"The more we look at the Corus plans the more faults we find,\" said ISTC general secretary Michael Leahy.

Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers has urged Corus to \"think again\" before pressing ahead with the redundancies. \"We think there is a better way forward and we hope that even at this late stage Corus will reconsider the position they have adopted.\" Corus chairman Sir Brian Moffat is due to be questioned by the trade and industry select committee today.

The Home Office has admitted to the Guardian that the government's pledge on donors will be unenforceable at the next general election - expected in May - and a host of loopholes could scupper bans in the future.</p> <p>Legislation which had been designed to stop all foreigners donating to parties comes into force on Friday. But foreign money can still be received by individual party candidates until July 1.</p> <p>This will leave an anomaly allowing anyone standing for parliament to receive personal donations from any foreign donor contributing to their campaign, providing it does not exceed their spending limits. It will also allow them to receive large donations before the campaign starts.</p> <p>Last night some Tory candidates were furious at the confusion.

      "bodyText": "Government plans to ban foreign donors from giving cash to political parties appeared in disarray last night. The Home Office has admitted to the Guardian that the government's pledge on donors will be unenforceable at the next general election - expected in May - and a host of loopholes could scupper bans in the future. Legislation which had been designed to stop all foreigners donating to parties comes into force on Friday. But foreign money can still be received by individual party candidates until July 1. This will leave an anomaly allowing anyone standing for parliament to receive personal donations from any foreign donor contributing to their campaign, providing it does not exceed their spending limits. It will also allow them to receive large donations before the campaign starts. Last night some Tory candidates were furious at the confusion. One candidate, David Shaw, who is fighting the Liberal Democrat marginal of Kingston and Surbiton, said: \"I have just turned down a personal donation from an American supporter on the grounds that it would be banned from Friday. \"Now I am told I could accept it - or perhaps even accept a larger donation - which I could then hand on as my personal donation to party funds. This is a ridiculous situation. This new law is riddled with anomalies.\" Details of the anomaly in the new law were disclosed during a briefing for the Guardian by Home Office officials and attended by Mike O'Brien, the minister responsible for implementing the new act. The anomaly, which will only apply for any general election held before July 1, is also compounded by other loopholes which could remain for much longer, until the new electoral commission has brought a series of test cases. The aim of the new law was to limit donations to UK voters and ban donations from everybody else. Ministers have already had to give a four-year exemption to Northern Ireland, allowing foreign donations to all parties putting up candidates for parliament. Special rules have had to be introduced to prevent the cash being transferred from Northern Ireland. Ministers then had to agree to a further relaxation allowing all European Union and Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK, who are entitled to vote, to give donations. This will now also apply to citizens from Mozambique after it joined the Commonwealth. The Home Office said only EU and Commonwealth citizens whose main residence was in the UK would be allowed to give donations. Resident Russian, Hong Kong, Chinese, Arab and East European citizens will be banned from donating - but wealthy resident donors could apply for an economic passport, available over the internet from St Kitts, Nevis and Belize, for around \u00a310,000 and become a Commonwealth citizen. They could then join the electoral register. Foreigners could also give donations through a British company or organisation trading in the UK.

The recognition that secondary class sizes should be reduced is a key concession by the government, which until now has focused on primary school ages. There was no mention of the proposals in Monday's green paper on schools, despite the acknowledgement that standards for pupils aged 11 to 14 are not high enough. Blair is also in urgent discussions with Ofsted, the government inspectorate, to see how the administrative burden of regular inspections could be lifted. He is also to provide \u00a380m to give small schools administrative support in handling an inspection. Without withdrawing from the commitment to rigorous external inspection, Mr Blair is aware that red tape is reducing the time teachers spend in the classroom. Red tape is the single biggest complaint levelled against the government by the teaching unions. The proposal to cut class sizes is likely to start with only 10 or so secondary schools, often in areas where English is not the pupils' first language. In some cases the class size will be cut to as low as 10 to 15. The scheme will be extended if it is seen to improve the performance of failing schools. At the same time Mr Blair told the Guardian he was not interested in setting up a two-tier secondary education system based on selection. He said in time he wanted all secondary schools to develop some form of distinctive ethos. The prime minister has been hammered by supporters of the comprehensive system for proposing in the green paper that by 2005 nearly half of all secondary schools would be specialist schools. Critics fear the remaining half of schools will be \"bog standard comprehensives\", the description given by Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's press secretary. Mr Blair said he wanted several kinds of secondary schools: foundation, city academies, church and specialist. \"I will not be deflected by criticism,\" he said. \"I still consider our proposals are the best way for the first time to give every child, and not just a privileged few, the chance of a decent education. \"The aim is that every school becomes a distinctive school.\" He added that the evidence was overwhelming that specialist schools had produced superior results, praising the sports specialist school in his Sedgefield constituency. Defending his drive to cut red tape in schools, Mr Blair said the number of documents sent out by the government to schools would be reduced by a third. He added that the government and Ofsted were looking into ways to make \"inspections less bureaucratic\". Discussions between Ofsted and Whitehall have located unnecessary investigations. Ministers have already promised that successful schools will not be subject to full-scale investigations, but instead subject to \"light touch\" inspections. The plan to reduce infant class sizes was one of Labour's five key election pledges in 1997. That commitment that five- to seven-year-olds would be in a class of less than 30 will be met ahead of schedule in September 2001, largely through extra investment of some \u00a3620m. At primary level, Labour has also taken steps to improve pupil-teacher ratios, and is investing further cash this year to ensure that eight- to 11-year-olds who had been in smaller classes in the earlier age group would continue to benefit. But teachers leaders' calls to extend targets to secondary schools have until now fallen on deaf ears. Ministers have insisted that it is down to the discretion of individual heads to use government cash to reduce class sizes by employing extra teachers.",

It has plans to charge users to download music, thereby supplying the record companies with payment for copyrighted material.</p> <p>But aside from Napster itself, the internet offers a great number of filesharing alternatives, some of which charge for the material downloaded, and some of which do not. </p> <p><a href=\"http://gnutella.wego.com/\">Gnutella</a> is a large, diversified service with no central server, which makes it difficult - if not impossible - to shut down. It's not as obviously user-friendly as Napster, and America Online, fearing legal fallout, will have nothing to do with it. But it has a large community of users that share everything from music to software to recipes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scour.com\">Scour.com</a>, formerly a place to swap music files for free, was shut down and has now been bought by CenterSpan Communications. The company plans to put the Scour Exchange back online as soon as it has found a way to make it legal, which the CenterSpan defines as any method of exchange that avoids $250bn lawsuits.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cutemx.com/\">CuteMX</a> is very much in the mould of Napster, allowing users swap music and video files for free. It includes an address for record companies and artists to write in if they feel their copyright has been infringed by CuteMX users.</p> <p>European newcomer <a href=\"http://www.zden.com/\">Zden</a> charges for its services as a marketplace for digital files, where people can buy, sell and store their own original content. The company describes itself as \"halfway between eBay and Napster\" and it controls the legality and copyright of centrally stored files. The site is far more business-focused than the other alternatives. </p> <p>In any filesharing service, the critical element is the number of users it attracts, so aside from the copyright issues, any service lives or dies by its membership. It is precisely the unprecedented membership numbers that may keep Napster alive and well ahead of its competition. </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,437979,00.html\">14.02.2001: EU passes internet copyright law</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,437682,00.html\">14.02.2001: Leader: The big players dig in</a></p>",

When I saw the bodies they were absolutely neat and tidy and placed perfectly respectfully on the floor.\" </p> <p>The BBC also reports that a mortuary assistant has said there were two available spaces in the main mortuary at the time when the bodies were placed in the chapel. </p> <p>The trust has launched its own internal investigation in an attempt to discover how the newspaper gained access to the chapel, which is a \"secure\" area of the mortuary, not normally accessible to the public.</p> <p>It is clear that many at the trust believe the scandal was deliberately engineered by disgruntled staff. Industrial relations at the trust have been poor in recent months.</p> <p>Dr Richard Rawlins, a consultant at Bedford hospital trust and a British Medical Association consultant's committee member, said the inquiry had not got to the core of the scandal but had merely attempted to retrospectively justify the removal of Mr Williams.</p> <p>He said Mr Williams should have at the very least been given leave until the inquiry had reported, rather than asking him to resign just hours after the official investigation was announced.</p> <p>Bedford hospital trust said today that Mr Williams had \"stood down\" rather than \"resigned\". This distinction enables him to continue to be paid until a severance agreement is agreed with the trust. If he had resigned, he would have forfeited his salary immediately.</p>",

The call follows a BBC investigation which claims that the official Bedford hospital NHS trust inquiry report refused to publish key evidence surrounding the incident last January. The affair broke after national newspapers carried pictures of seven wrapped corpses stored in the \"chapel\" area of Bedford hospital mortuary because a temporary mortuary was inaccessible. The inquiry report said most staff \"refused to believe that the photographs could have been obtained except by tampering with the bodies and their coverings beforehand\". But it did not include evidence from a hospital consultant which suggests that the bodies may well have been \"styled\" to provide maximum impact for the cameras. According to the BBC, Jane Hurst, a consultant anaesthetist looked in on the chapel of rest earlier in the evening in question - and she said the bodies were undisturbed. \"All the bodies were wrapped up and labelled and tidy. When I saw the bodies they were absolutely neat and tidy and placed perfectly respectfully on the floor.\" The BBC also reports that a mortuary assistant has said there were two available spaces in the main mortuary at the time when the bodies were placed in the chapel. The trust has launched its own internal investigation in an attempt to discover how the newspaper gained access to the chapel, which is a \"secure\" area of the mortuary, not normally accessible to the public. It is clear that many at the trust believe the scandal was deliberately engineered by disgruntled staff. Industrial relations at the trust have been poor in recent months. Dr Richard Rawlins, a consultant at Bedford hospital trust and a British Medical Association consultant's committee member, said the inquiry had not got to the core of the scandal but had merely attempted to retrospectively justify the removal of Mr Williams. He said Mr Williams should have at the very least been given leave until the inquiry had reported, rather than asking him to resign just hours after the official investigation was announced. Bedford hospital trust said today that Mr Williams had \"stood down\" rather than \"resigned\". This distinction enables him to continue to be paid until a severance agreement is agreed with the trust. If he had resigned, he would have forfeited his salary immediately.",

      "body": "<p><strong>What makes Albion so special?</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, Albion were always the midlands' top Football Academy. The Villa might win more trophies, the Wolves might have their moments with their trademark long ball approach, but you could rely on the Albion for playing cultured football, scoring goals, and winning the Cup now and then.</p> <p>As a small town club - don't believe this West-Bromwich-is-in-Birmingham nonsense - Albion have always punched above their weight since they were founder members of the Football League, but the last fifteen years have been the worst in the club's long history. In 1979 Albion, with Ron Atkinson in charge, of Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendan Batson, were the leaders of the \"Black Revolution\" in English football, and one of the most attractive sides in Europe. By 1986 they were barely the best team in West Bromwich as they sank, a laughing stock, into the Second Division, dropping into the Third Division for the first time five years later.</p> <p>Now we're famous for the highest turnover of managers in the whole League - one a year for the past eleven seasons or so, including a record three last season! But things are changing.</p> <p><strong>The high point</strong></p> <p>Although only one midlands club has won the FA Cup since Albion last won it in 1968 - and that's Coventry City, who don't count - that's more than a lifetime away for many Albion fans. Instead, they recall with pleasure the one real great occasion of the last thirty years - our Second Division play-off victory against Port Vale at Wembley in 1993. (Although most real fans with say that the home leg of the semi-final against Swansea had more passion.)</p> <p><strong>The low point</strong></p> <p>Far too many recently, but the two which struck at the heart of all of us came in the same 1990-91 season. If losing 4-2 at home to Woking in the third round of the FA Cup was not humiliating enough, relegation to the old Third Division for the first time at Twerton Park on the last day of the season really put a cap on it. Had we won that last game, Leicester City would have gone down instead - wonder what's happened to them since?</p> <p><strong>Our last game</strong></p> <p>Stockport did not quite roll over and die the way they were supposed to at The Hawthorns last Saturday. In fact, they should have been three goals ahead by the time Albion scored through Jason Roberts, right on the half-time whistle.</p> <p>Albion controlled the second half without really impressing, but conceded an equaliser - a fabulous shot from Cooper - to lose two valuable points. How much does it matter? Well, none of the top six clubs managed a win either, so in the short term, not a lot.</p> <p><strong>Our next game</strong></p> <p>Next Saturday, Albion travel to St Andrews for one of the biggest games of the season, as they take on Trevor Francis's Birmingham City side, just two weeks before they meet Liverpool in the League Cup Final. </p> <p>Blues have been a problem recently, but they will surely have more on their mind than a west midlands derby, so Albion should buck the trend and come away with at least a point.</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>For so many years, Birmingham City were the butt of Albion fans' humour. They never won anything (well, there was a League Cup in the Sixties, it's rumoured), they never did anything, and they never beat us.</p> <p>Now they've been taken over by a porn millionaire, things have changed. We haven't beaten them for years, they get to the play-offs every season, and now they've reached the League Cup Final. We can't believe it: it's a distortion of the very bedrock of football in the Midlands, and the sooner it gets back to normal, the better. Especially as we could be meeting them in the play-offs come May.</p> <p><strong>The chairman</strong></p> <p>After years of second-raters in the top job, Albion have struck lucky with Barnsley-based businessman Paul Thompson. Traditionally, Albion directors have been local small (and small minded) businessmen and Thompson, recruited through an advert in The Times and with no local links, was initially distrusted by fans.</p> <p>However, since leaving the club to return in a blaze of glory in December 1999, he has delivered on all of the promises that were continually broken by his predecessors. Not only has he found the money for the manager to build up the best Albion side in fifteen years, he has completed the rebuilding of the ground and purchased the much-needed training ground that the previous regime had been banging on about for over five years.</p> <p>The club now has a professional approach - on and off the pitch - that was never there before, and although, inevitably, there are still a few things we would like to see improve, Albion fans have nothing but praise for the chairman.</p> <p><strong>Local rivals</strong></p> <p>For the first eighty years of the club's existence, at least, the only rivals were Aston Villa - the only other local team capable of winning anything. No other neighbouring clubs can claim to have met one another in three separate FA Cup finals, and the fixture regularly used to attract 60,000-plus gates.</p> <p>But it's difficult to hate a team you never play, and apart from the occasional Cup drubbing, the teams have been in different divisions for years. Now, a whole new hate-culture has developed, centred on our Black Country neighbours, Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p> <p>I suppose it's our own fault. Selling them four key players - including their cult hero and record goalscorer Steve Bull back in 1986 - saved the Wolves from going out of business, long before their \"Golden Tit\" Jack Hayward came on the scene to pour in the cash. </p> <p>Now the rivalry has reached a unsavoury level unseen anywhere outside Glasgow: a Black Country derby is a true throwback to the bad old days of the Seventies, on and off the pitch - but Albion have only lost a couple in the last seven years. With our neighbours' recent slump, the only thing they've got to look forward to this season is trying to take three points from our promotion run-in when we visit Molineux in March.</p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>Albion supporters are, thankfully, very conservative on this subject. We're the only club in the League to play in navy blue stripes, the kit's been that way since 1889, and it's going to stay that way. The thickness of the stripes change, and they faff around with the trimmings, but the only real variation we've had in recent years is a bizarre, but very popular, \"barcode stripes\" design introduced in 1992.</p> <p>Consequently, great attention is paid to the away strip, which is currently a poor Arsenal yellow and blue copy, but will soon be returning to everybody's favourite - the yellow and green stripes made famous by Atkinson's great side in the late Seventies. And about time too.</p> <p><strong>Merchandising</strong></p> <p>It's hard to knock Albion's merchandising: it's so low-key and understated, it's hard to see any. Apart from the ubiquitous replica shirts, the club shop is a waste land of missed opportunity and lack of direction. Better that the Man United overkill, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>Mascot</strong></p> <p>There is an Albion mascot, called Baggie Bird. Although the fans' usual nickname for the club is The Baggies - derived from the baggy moleskin trousers of the club's traditional iron-working supporters in the 1890s (honest!) - the club's logo of a thrush also gave them the title of The Throstles. (But call them that in a pub in West Brom and you'd better watch out!) </p> <p>Baggie Bird is OK if you like the Disneyfication of the game, but is now rarely seen at away games after a little contretemps with the infamous Wolves mascot a couple of years ago.</p> <p><strong>Players we love</strong></p> <p>Current player, no question - it's Black Country lad and life-time Albion supporter Lee Hughes, top scorer here for the past four seasons.

      "bodyText": "What makes Albion so special? Traditionally, Albion were always the midlands' top Football Academy. The Villa might win more trophies, the Wolves might have their moments with their trademark long ball approach, but you could rely on the Albion for playing cultured football, scoring goals, and winning the Cup now and then. As a small town club - don't believe this West-Bromwich-is-in-Birmingham nonsense - Albion have always punched above their weight since they were founder members of the Football League, but the last fifteen years have been the worst in the club's long history. In 1979 Albion, with Ron Atkinson in charge, of Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendan Batson, were the leaders of the \"Black Revolution\" in English football, and one of the most attractive sides in Europe. By 1986 they were barely the best team in West Bromwich as they sank, a laughing stock, into the Second Division, dropping into the Third Division for the first time five years later. Now we're famous for the highest turnover of managers in the whole League - one a year for the past eleven seasons or so, including a record three last season! But things are changing. The high point Although only one midlands club has won the FA Cup since Albion last won it in 1968 - and that's Coventry City, who don't count - that's more than a lifetime away for many Albion fans. Instead, they recall with pleasure the one real great occasion of the last thirty years - our Second Division play-off victory against Port Vale at Wembley in 1993. (Although most real fans with say that the home leg of the semi-final against Swansea had more passion.) The low point Far too many recently, but the two which struck at the heart of all of us came in the same 1990-91 season. If losing 4-2 at home to Woking in the third round of the FA Cup was not humiliating enough, relegation to the old Third Division for the first time at Twerton Park on the last day of the season really put a cap on it. Had we won that last game, Leicester City would have gone down instead - wonder what's happened to them since? Our last game Stockport did not quite roll over and die the way they were supposed to at The Hawthorns last Saturday. In fact, they should have been three goals ahead by the time Albion scored through Jason Roberts, right on the half-time whistle. Albion controlled the second half without really impressing, but conceded an equaliser - a fabulous shot from Cooper - to lose two valuable points. How much does it matter? Well, none of the top six clubs managed a win either, so in the short term, not a lot. Our next game Next Saturday, Albion travel to St Andrews for one of the biggest games of the season, as they take on Trevor Francis's Birmingham City side, just two weeks before they meet Liverpool in the League Cup Final. Blues have been a problem recently, but they will surely have more on their mind than a west midlands derby, so Albion should buck the trend and come away with at least a point. Sore point For so many years, Birmingham City were the butt of Albion fans' humour. They never won anything (well, there was a League Cup in the Sixties, it's rumoured), they never did anything, and they never beat us. Now they've been taken over by a porn millionaire, things have changed. We haven't beaten them for years, they get to the play-offs every season, and now they've reached the League Cup Final. We can't believe it: it's a distortion of the very bedrock of football in the Midlands, and the sooner it gets back to normal, the better. Especially as we could be meeting them in the play-offs come May. The chairman After years of second-raters in the top job, Albion have struck lucky with Barnsley-based businessman Paul Thompson. Traditionally, Albion directors have been local small (and small minded) businessmen and Thompson, recruited through an advert in The Times and with no local links, was initially distrusted by fans. However, since leaving the club to return in a blaze of glory in December 1999, he has delivered on all of the promises that were continually broken by his predecessors. Not only has he found the money for the manager to build up the best Albion side in fifteen years, he has completed the rebuilding of the ground and purchased the much-needed training ground that the previous regime had been banging on about for over five years. The club now has a professional approach - on and off the pitch - that was never there before, and although, inevitably, there are still a few things we would like to see improve, Albion fans have nothing but praise for the chairman. Local rivals For the first eighty years of the club's existence, at least, the only rivals were Aston Villa - the only other local team capable of winning anything. No other neighbouring clubs can claim to have met one another in three separate FA Cup finals, and the fixture regularly used to attract 60,000-plus gates. But it's difficult to hate a team you never play, and apart from the occasional Cup drubbing, the teams have been in different divisions for years. Now, a whole new hate-culture has developed, centred on our Black Country neighbours, Wolverhampton Wanderers. I suppose it's our own fault. Selling them four key players - including their cult hero and record goalscorer Steve Bull back in 1986 - saved the Wolves from going out of business, long before their \"Golden Tit\" Jack Hayward came on the scene to pour in the cash. Now the rivalry has reached a unsavoury level unseen anywhere outside Glasgow: a Black Country derby is a true throwback to the bad old days of the Seventies, on and off the pitch - but Albion have only lost a couple in the last seven years. With our neighbours' recent slump, the only thing they've got to look forward to this season is trying to take three points from our promotion run-in when we visit Molineux in March. Kit Albion supporters are, thankfully, very conservative on this subject. We're the only club in the League to play in navy blue stripes, the kit's been that way since 1889, and it's going to stay that way. The thickness of the stripes change, and they faff around with the trimmings, but the only real variation we've had in recent years is a bizarre, but very popular, \"barcode stripes\" design introduced in 1992. Consequently, great attention is paid to the away strip, which is currently a poor Arsenal yellow and blue copy, but will soon be returning to everybody's favourite - the yellow and green stripes made famous by Atkinson's great side in the late Seventies. And about time too. Merchandising It's hard to knock Albion's merchandising: it's so low-key and understated, it's hard to see any. Apart from the ubiquitous replica shirts, the club shop is a waste land of missed opportunity and lack of direction. Better that the Man United overkill, I suppose. Mascot There is an Albion mascot, called Baggie Bird. Although the fans' usual nickname for the club is The Baggies - derived from the baggy moleskin trousers of the club's traditional iron-working supporters in the 1890s (honest!) - the club's logo of a thrush also gave them the title of The Throstles. (But call them that in a pub in West Brom and you'd better watch out!) Baggie Bird is OK if you like the Disneyfication of the game, but is now rarely seen at away games after a little contretemps with the infamous Wolves mascot a couple of years ago. Players we love Current player, no question - it's Black Country lad and life-time Albion supporter Lee Hughes, top scorer here for the past four seasons. Before that it was Super Bob Taylor, who returned, Messiah-like, last March, to score the goals which kept us up on the last day of last season. Add to that The Beast, our huge Danish keeper Brian Jensen, and you've pretty much covered the fans' favourites, although wily old veteran Ruel Fox is fast becoming one. Of blessed memory: The King, or Jeff Astle, once of Frank Skinner's Fantasy Football programme, but better remembered as one of the best goalscorers of the Sixties; winger Willie Johnston; and Tony Brown, the holder of every club record around, who's still to be seen at every game. The most accepted player from another team? Strangely enough, it has to be former Wolves defender Keith Curle, now with Sheffield United, who was greeted this season with \"Keith's an Albion fan\" after gracing recent local derbies with a glorious winning own goal, a missed penalty and stretchering off one of his own men. To his credit, Curle took it all very well. Players we hate When you're doing as well as we are at the moment, there are few club villains around - especially as Gary Megson off-loaded most of the deadwood in the summer. Even the inconsistent Matt Carbon, transfer-listed last week, has his fans. Possibly James Quinn, who has scored more goals for Northern Ireland - one - than he has done League goals for the club in the past two years. In the past though, there have been so many hate figures - players and managers. Least popular player was probably Stockport reject (and another Northern Ireland international, God help us) Paul Williams. But the hatred felt for him was as nothing compared to that of the man who threw \u00a3250,000 away on him, manager Bobby Gould. Albion fans carried a coffin around the streets of Shrewsbury in 1992 in a bid to get him sacked - it worked! The most hated player from any other side, now that Steve Bull has retired from Wolves, is undoubtedly former Baggie, Paul \"Mr Mercenary\" Peschisolido, who only last month maintained his incredible scoring record against us with a goal on his loan debut for Sheffield United. The fact that he is also married to the chairman of Birmingham City, Karen Brady, does not add to his popularity round here. The ground The Hawthorns was the first football ground to be built in the 20th century, in 1900 - but with recent stand-building, there's nothing whatsoever left of the original. Also, geographically speaking, the highest ground in the entire League, but don't expect hills and dales - this is the centre of the Black Country. As we write, a new stand is going up, the old Rainbow Stand having been pulled down a month ago. When it's finished, an already attractive and characterful stadium will have a 27,000 capacity, and will be ready for that Premiership place. The crowd Strangely enough, pulling down the Rainbow Stand was the best thing that could have happened for the atmosphere at the ground. Sure, it's eerie the way the sound just floats away out of the ground now, but the resulting sardine-like packing in of what are now guaranteed capacity gates into the other three sides means that the match-day atmosphere is electric - for the first time since Ossie Ardiles was manager in the early Nineties. Local knowledge Over the years, the immediate vicinity of The Hawthorns has become a pub-free zone, for away supporters at least. Locals make use of the photocard scheme at The Hawthorns Hotel, or the secret \"Freemasons' Knock\" which gains entry to the famous Woodman pub, abutting the ground, but away fans are not welcome anywhere nearby. However, just a mile towards the town centre, near the M5 junction, is The Vine, peaceful but incredibly popular because of its great value Baltis and other Indian food. Otherwise, it's another mile towards the town centre, or five miles the other way to Birmingham. Catering inside the ground is a disgrace, in terms of cost, choice and quality. Links Being situated midway between Birmingham, Walsall and Wolverhampton, West Bromwich has always had some of the best press coverage in the country, and there is no shortage of opinions on the local sides.

But so many people have signed up - 220 by last night - that its director, Peter Jenkinson, is considering making it a monthly event.</p> <p>\"Clubs have them, supermarkets have them - why shouldn't we - as a truly romantic venue, with a great throbbing love story at the heart of the collection - have a singles night too? The response has been amazing,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Jenkinson, who is newly single, will be present himself - \"purely in a professional capacity\".</p> <p>Tonight's frolics will include readings from passionate love letters sent by the sculptor Jacob Epstein to Kathleen Garman. He was already a famous - though perpetually cash-strapped - sculptor, married, and 20 years older than she.</p> <p>The gallery's collection includes a bronze portrait bust, which Epstein is said to have started the morning after they first went to bed together.</p> <p>They met in the 1920s in a Bohemian cafe called the Harlequin in Chelsea, west London, when she was 21.</p> <p>\"He spotted her, came over and said she just had to model for him, but she refused,\" the curator, Oliver Buckley, said. \"They were obviously really struck, however, because they both went back the next night in the hope of meeting again, and that was it.\"</p> <p>They eventually married, and Garman's art collection, including dozens of Epsteins, and works by Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh, was left to Walsall on her death. It was kept for decades, mostly in store in the old library, until the award-winning \u00a321m lottery-backed gallery, designed by Caruso St John, opened last year.</p> <p>The archive that came with the pictures includes boxes of papers which are only now being unpacked and transcribed. There are more than 100 letters from Epstein to Garman, many of them ardent love letters.</p> <p>One ends, \"Be there Saturday Sweetheart.\" The words were spelled out in blue neon, replicating Epstein's handwriting, in a piece created for the gallery by the contemporary artist Fiona Banner.</p> <p>It was installed for a time on the roof of a nearby building, causing considerable local puzzlement.</p> <p>Given the background of the collection, the director has decided not to worry about whether his guests are all bona fide singles. They can choose between looking at the pictures, dancing in the foyer, or having a romantic meal in the rooftop restaurant with its views across the West Midlands. The gallery closes at 10pm, but the bar next door, also owned by the gallery, is open till 2am.</p> <p>Staff have been devising artistic chat up lines, to be supplied on cribsheets to tongue-tied guests. Samples include, \"Do I Turner you on?\", and \"Hello, you look lonely; would you like me to help you through your Blue Period?\"</p> <p>Mr Jenkinson said: \"This proves it beyond any doubt that Walsall is simply the most romantic town in Britain.\"</p>",

But so many people have signed up - 220 by last night - that its director, Peter Jenkinson, is considering making it a monthly event. \"Clubs have them, supermarkets have them - why shouldn't we - as a truly romantic venue, with a great throbbing love story at the heart of the collection - have a singles night too? The response has been amazing,\" he said. Mr Jenkinson, who is newly single, will be present himself - \"purely in a professional capacity\". Tonight's frolics will include readings from passionate love letters sent by the sculptor Jacob Epstein to Kathleen Garman. He was already a famous - though perpetually cash-strapped - sculptor, married, and 20 years older than she. The gallery's collection includes a bronze portrait bust, which Epstein is said to have started the morning after they first went to bed together. They met in the 1920s in a Bohemian cafe called the Harlequin in Chelsea, west London, when she was 21. \"He spotted her, came over and said she just had to model for him, but she refused,\" the curator, Oliver Buckley, said. \"They were obviously really struck, however, because they both went back the next night in the hope of meeting again, and that was it.\" They eventually married, and Garman's art collection, including dozens of Epsteins, and works by Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh, was left to Walsall on her death. It was kept for decades, mostly in store in the old library, until the award-winning \u00a321m lottery-backed gallery, designed by Caruso St John, opened last year. The archive that came with the pictures includes boxes of papers which are only now being unpacked and transcribed. There are more than 100 letters from Epstein to Garman, many of them ardent love letters. One ends, \"Be there Saturday Sweetheart.\" The words were spelled out in blue neon, replicating Epstein's handwriting, in a piece created for the gallery by the contemporary artist Fiona Banner. It was installed for a time on the roof of a nearby building, causing considerable local puzzlement. Given the background of the collection, the director has decided not to worry about whether his guests are all bona fide singles. They can choose between looking at the pictures, dancing in the foyer, or having a romantic meal in the rooftop restaurant with its views across the West Midlands. The gallery closes at 10pm, but the bar next door, also owned by the gallery, is open till 2am. Staff have been devising artistic chat up lines, to be supplied on cribsheets to tongue-tied guests. Samples include, \"Do I Turner you on?\", and \"Hello, you look lonely; would you like me to help you through your Blue Period?\" Mr Jenkinson said: \"This proves it beyond any doubt that Walsall is simply the most romantic town in Britain.\"",

      "body": "<p>It was his ghostly pallor and refusal to eat supper that gave him away. Adam thought he was sick and suggested he lie down while the others ate. Later, after clearing up, Adam went up to his room - two flights, to the top of the house - to see if he was OK. Forgetting to knock, Adam opened the door to find Joe on his bed, joint alight. </p> <p>A few days short of his 16th birthday, we were having to deal with our son's cannabis use. It came as a surprise, despite the fact that we know the statistics on teenagers and drugs. There had been no telltale signs: no mood swings, no secretive behaviour, no cash shortages, no enlarged pupils - not even a whiff of smoke. Of course, we had talked about our attitude towards drugs and how we might deal with the issue when it arose. We just hadn't expected it to arise yet. A few weeks earlier, I had confidently, smugly told a colleague that my son was sailing through a trouble-free adolescence. </p> <p>Of course, we were not alone. Surveys in the 1990s showed that between a quarter and a third of 14- and 15-year-olds had tried drugs; and the number rose steeply after 16. Jack Straw's teenage son was caught offering it for sale. When Ann Widdecombe proposed a crackdown on users, seven shadow cabinet members said they had tried it. Last week, the government announced that police cautions for possession would no longer be part of a criminal record - a sign of changing attitudes to cannabis use. </p> <p>Adam called me as I was driving home. \"There's something you should know,\" he announced - words guaranteed to sink the heart at the end of a long day at work. Briefly, he told me what had happened. \"I've had a mellow chat to him already,\" Adam joked, making me giggle down the mobile, \"but I said we'd talk to him properly together when you get home.\" We agreed to discuss it alone first to establish a united front. </p> <p>I had half an hour in the car to work out my response. Adam and I had both smoked dope in the past, and had tried different drugs. But it was mostly in pre-parenthood days. Since that cloak of responsibility had settled on us, we had shared a joint at a party on less than a handful of occasions. We support decriminalisation of cannabis, and we both believe it is less harmful than tobacco or alcohol. We know that almost every teenager will try it, and we don't buy the argument that it leads inevitably to harder, more dangerous drugs. </p> <p>But this was our son, our baby. Surely that was different? Whenever I had ventured a liberal line on teenagers and dope with family or friends, I had been warned that I would feel a lot less liberal when it came to my own children. In that half-hour in the car, I first waited for an instinctive gut reaction to the news. When none came, I tried out various responses on myself. It felt like testing for pain, prodding and poking at myself, waiting for a sharp jolt that I could label. </p> <p>Was I shocked? Not really. I knew too much about the prevalence of cannabis smoking among teenagers. Was I angry? Not really. I remembered too much of my own teenage years for that. Alarmed? Sad? Trust betrayed? Not really. Curiously, I felt almost nothing. </p> <p>When I arrived home, I found Joe lying on the sofa, looking sheepish, with anxious eyes that betrayed his expectation of trouble. Adam was in the kitchen, sitting at the table with five - five! - joints in front of him. On being caught with a lit joint and an open bedroom window, Joe had quickly confessed: he had been smoking for about four months; he bought dope from a friend's older brother; he never smoked anywhere near school. The five spliffs were inside a cassette case lying on a chair next to his bed. Adam spotted them straight away and had brought the evidence to show me. </p> <p>We looked at the joints, then looked at each other. \"He rolls quite a good joint for a 15-year-old,\" said Adam wryly. \"What are we going to say?\" Within minutes, we established common ground. Neither of us thought this was a heinous crime, yet we didn't feel that we could give Joe our blessing. As Adam split open one of the joints to see how much dope was inside, I felt - at last - a proper parental response. It was, of course, mostly tobacco - the substance to which Joe had been consistently opposed throughout his adolescence, and one which I felt was far more dangerous and addictive than cannabis. We agreed a number of points to put to Joe, and called him in. </p> <p>It's a strange thing, being a parent. You remember your own teenage years all too clearly - the injustices, the humiliations, the rows, the bollockings, the slammed doors, the fury - and yet, inevitably, you find yourself 25 years down the line adopting the role of prosecutor, judge, executioner. You ask the same questions - \"What time will you be home? Where are you going? Who with?\" - that your parents asked you. And you hear your own teenage voice reply - \"Don't know. Why do you need to know? Leave me alone.\" As Joe came in the room, my mind went straight back to similar painful sessions with my own parents, when the last thing you want to do is \"talk it through\", but you know that is the minimum price you must pay for your transgression. </p> <p>So the three of us sat round the spliffs and talked it through. Actually, Adam and I did most of the talking. First, it's illegal, we said. You may not agree with that, and we may not either, but that's a fact: if you get caught, you'll be in trouble with the law. Second, if you smoke at school, or have it with you, and get caught, you will be expelled. Third, if you are buying dope from someone, sooner or later that person will offer you something different to try - and that's the point where we might be less tolerant. Fourth, you are more likely to come to harm from the tobacco in the joints than from the dope. Fifth, it's expensive and you have to decide what you want to spend your money on. Sixth, if you ever offer it to your little sister, we will break your legs. And so on. </p> <p>Joe said little, apart from telling us that \"everybody\" at his leafy-suburb school smoked dope. Really everybody? He qualified the figure to 90% of his friends and contemporaries. </p> <p>After 20 minutes of trying to ram home the dangers of harder drugs and tobacco, we asked Joe to go away and think long and hard about what we had said. We stared at each other, and at the spliffs on the table. Had we handled it right? Impossible to say. </p> <p>After about three minutes, the door opened and Joe's face poked round. \"Are you going to give me my dope back?\" he asked, tilting his head at the joints. We handed them over. </p> <p>Did we do the right thing? What is \"the right thing\", anyway? It's hard to navigate your way through parenthood, to know how much space to give; how protective or how tough to be. For something that so many people do, and so many have done down the years, parenthood has no definitive rules. The compass-points that guided my parents' generation are not necessarily relevant today, but neither does the experience of one's peer group always accurately reflect one's own rational views on a particular issue. So we muddle through, try not to be hypocritical, and hope for the best. </p> <p>Two weeks after our discovery, Joe doesn't seem any different from the loving, happy, intelligent, well-balanced teenager he was before. That said, when he burst through the door at the weekend, enveloped me then Adam in giant bear hugs, ate two bananas in quick succession, and launched into a long and rambling account of his plans to travel the world in a camper van, Adam caught my eye behind Joe's back. </p> <p>\"He's stoned,\" he mouthed. </p> <p>\u0095 All names have been changed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was his ghostly pallor and refusal to eat supper that gave him away. Adam thought he was sick and suggested he lie down while the others ate. Later, after clearing up, Adam went up to his room - two flights, to the top of the house - to see if he was OK. Forgetting to knock, Adam opened the door to find Joe on his bed, joint alight. A few days short of his 16th birthday, we were having to deal with our son's cannabis use. It came as a surprise, despite the fact that we know the statistics on teenagers and drugs. There had been no telltale signs: no mood swings, no secretive behaviour, no cash shortages, no enlarged pupils - not even a whiff of smoke. Of course, we had talked about our attitude towards drugs and how we might deal with the issue when it arose. We just hadn't expected it to arise yet. A few weeks earlier, I had confidently, smugly told a colleague that my son was sailing through a trouble-free adolescence. Of course, we were not alone. Surveys in the 1990s showed that between a quarter and a third of 14- and 15-year-olds had tried drugs; and the number rose steeply after 16. Jack Straw's teenage son was caught offering it for sale. When Ann Widdecombe proposed a crackdown on users, seven shadow cabinet members said they had tried it. Last week, the government announced that police cautions for possession would no longer be part of a criminal record - a sign of changing attitudes to cannabis use. Adam called me as I was driving home. \"There's something you should know,\" he announced - words guaranteed to sink the heart at the end of a long day at work. Briefly, he told me what had happened. \"I've had a mellow chat to him already,\" Adam joked, making me giggle down the mobile, \"but I said we'd talk to him properly together when you get home.\" We agreed to discuss it alone first to establish a united front. I had half an hour in the car to work out my response. Adam and I had both smoked dope in the past, and had tried different drugs. But it was mostly in pre-parenthood days. Since that cloak of responsibility had settled on us, we had shared a joint at a party on less than a handful of occasions. We support decriminalisation of cannabis, and we both believe it is less harmful than tobacco or alcohol. We know that almost every teenager will try it, and we don't buy the argument that it leads inevitably to harder, more dangerous drugs. But this was our son, our baby. Surely that was different? Whenever I had ventured a liberal line on teenagers and dope with family or friends, I had been warned that I would feel a lot less liberal when it came to my own children. In that half-hour in the car, I first waited for an instinctive gut reaction to the news. When none came, I tried out various responses on myself. It felt like testing for pain, prodding and poking at myself, waiting for a sharp jolt that I could label. Was I shocked? Not really. I knew too much about the prevalence of cannabis smoking among teenagers. Was I angry? Not really. I remembered too much of my own teenage years for that. Alarmed? Sad? Trust betrayed? Not really. Curiously, I felt almost nothing. When I arrived home, I found Joe lying on the sofa, looking sheepish, with anxious eyes that betrayed his expectation of trouble. Adam was in the kitchen, sitting at the table with five - five! - joints in front of him. On being caught with a lit joint and an open bedroom window, Joe had quickly confessed: he had been smoking for about four months; he bought dope from a friend's older brother; he never smoked anywhere near school. The five spliffs were inside a cassette case lying on a chair next to his bed. Adam spotted them straight away and had brought the evidence to show me. We looked at the joints, then looked at each other. \"He rolls quite a good joint for a 15-year-old,\" said Adam wryly. \"What are we going to say?\" Within minutes, we established common ground. Neither of us thought this was a heinous crime, yet we didn't feel that we could give Joe our blessing. As Adam split open one of the joints to see how much dope was inside, I felt - at last - a proper parental response. It was, of course, mostly tobacco - the substance to which Joe had been consistently opposed throughout his adolescence, and one which I felt was far more dangerous and addictive than cannabis. We agreed a number of points to put to Joe, and called him in. It's a strange thing, being a parent. You remember your own teenage years all too clearly - the injustices, the humiliations, the rows, the bollockings, the slammed doors, the fury - and yet, inevitably, you find yourself 25 years down the line adopting the role of prosecutor, judge, executioner. You ask the same questions - \"What time will you be home? Where are you going? Who with?\" - that your parents asked you. And you hear your own teenage voice reply - \"Don't know. Why do you need to know? Leave me alone.\" As Joe came in the room, my mind went straight back to similar painful sessions with my own parents, when the last thing you want to do is \"talk it through\", but you know that is the minimum price you must pay for your transgression. So the three of us sat round the spliffs and talked it through. Actually, Adam and I did most of the talking. First, it's illegal, we said. You may not agree with that, and we may not either, but that's a fact: if you get caught, you'll be in trouble with the law. Second, if you smoke at school, or have it with you, and get caught, you will be expelled. Third, if you are buying dope from someone, sooner or later that person will offer you something different to try - and that's the point where we might be less tolerant. Fourth, you are more likely to come to harm from the tobacco in the joints than from the dope. Fifth, it's expensive and you have to decide what you want to spend your money on. Sixth, if you ever offer it to your little sister, we will break your legs. And so on. Joe said little, apart from telling us that \"everybody\" at his leafy-suburb school smoked dope. Really everybody? He qualified the figure to 90% of his friends and contemporaries. After 20 minutes of trying to ram home the dangers of harder drugs and tobacco, we asked Joe to go away and think long and hard about what we had said. We stared at each other, and at the spliffs on the table. Had we handled it right? Impossible to say. After about three minutes, the door opened and Joe's face poked round. \"Are you going to give me my dope back?\" he asked, tilting his head at the joints. We handed them over. Did we do the right thing? What is \"the right thing\", anyway? It's hard to navigate your way through parenthood, to know how much space to give; how protective or how tough to be. For something that so many people do, and so many have done down the years, parenthood has no definitive rules. The compass-points that guided my parents' generation are not necessarily relevant today, but neither does the experience of one's peer group always accurately reflect one's own rational views on a particular issue. So we muddle through, try not to be hypocritical, and hope for the best. Two weeks after our discovery, Joe doesn't seem any different from the loving, happy, intelligent, well-balanced teenager he was before. That said, when he burst through the door at the weekend, enveloped me then Adam in giant bear hugs, ate two bananas in quick succession, and launched into a long and rambling account of his plans to travel the world in a camper van, Adam caught my eye behind Joe's back. \"He's stoned,\" he mouthed. \u0095 All names have been changed.",

      "bodyText": "Under pressure to meet Tony Blair's rattled promise to Sir David Frost on his Sunday morning TV show that the UK would match European average spending on health care within five years, the chancellor rained resources down on the delighted new health secretary Alan Milburn. In one of the shortest budget addresses of recent time (51minutes), and certainly the quickest words-per-minute delivery of all time, the iron chancellor managed nine references to his beloved \"prudence\" and only a couple to the spectre of \"Tory boom and bust\" \u0096 perhaps a realisation that Mr Brown's fourth budget could no longer blame all ills on the previous administration. With a bulging warchest from the sale of mobile phone bandwave licences, the chancellor doled out the biggest increase in NHS spending in its 52-year history: \u00a32bn immediately and a 35% real increase in funds by 2004. Part of this would pay for a huge recruitment drive aimed at bringing in 10,000 extra nurses. There was also \u00a31bn for education, enabling education secretary David Blunkett to offer secondary school heads a one-off pyment of \u00a350,000 and primary schools \u00a39,000, and \u00a34bn for transport. Mr Brown also cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny and offered a range of tax incentives to hi-tech internet companies. The budget was seen as the bursting of the public spending dam after two years of sticking to Tory spending plans by those on the left, but slammed by Conservative leader William Hague as \"a panic \u0096 chucking money at the Labour heartlands.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also accused the chancellor of bribing voters so that Labour could win the next election. However, it was more for what the budget did not do that it may be remember by history, as Labour's decision to maintain the fuel tax escalator and give pensioners a 75p a week increase in pensions came back to haunt them in the autumn. Income tax The chancellor made good his promise of the year before to cut the basic rate of income tax from 23p in the pound to 22p. The threshold at which the 40% tax rate starts remained the same at \u00a328,400. Mortgage tax relief was abolished as was the married couple's allowance, making the average couple \u00a33 a week worse off. Duty Smokers were hit with another whopping rise in the cost of packet of fags \u0096 up by 25p despite the booming trade in bootleg cigarettes from the continent.

Madonna tried much the same tack with her show at Brixton Academy and she got away with half an hour of waffle, merely because her audience were delighted to be there. U2 eschewed irony and cleverness. Ever aware of a chance to grandstand, they showcased their superlative new album All That You Can't Leave Behind. Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of epitomised all that remains right about them: a beautiful song and a languid, elegiac singalong. By contrast, Beautiful Day was an upbeat shoutalong - even John Hurt at the front of the circle clapped along - and the rumbling New York, all heroic backlighting, was evidence that they can stimulate mind as well as body. Some of the hits were there too: the opening Until The End Of The World, a swashbuckling Mysterious Ways and even 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and I Will Follow, songs older than many of the fans in the audience. Bono, part Elvis Presley, part Joe Strummer, part Dublin urchin, still has charisma. He is over-familiar by default, but close-up, when he steps into the crowd, giving all appearances of walking on water, he is mesmerising, interspersing snatches of the Pogues' A Rainy Night In Soho, Craig David's Walking Away, the Monkees' Stepping Stone and a hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck a cappella Unchained Melody. When he is sincere, there are none better. Behind him, guitarist The Edge resembled the Village People's construction worker and sang high on Beautiful Day. Bassist Adam Clayton seemed faintly amused and Larry Mullen hit his drum kit, the largest since Keith Moon's, as if possessed. U2 have been parodied, sneered at, mocked and misunderstood. However, when they are on this form, they are unstoppable. As good as they ought to have been.",

As it was, the baby was two weeks late, and we duly made an appointment for Jennifer to be induced. Leaving home at 7am sharp with our bags, and not a contraction in sight, it felt more like we were going on holiday - an impression reinforced when our 7.30 appointment turned into a four-hour wait. </p> <p>After weeks of antenatal classes, learning breathing exercises and probing acupressure points, I soon learned the husband's most crucial role in childbirth: tracking down midwives. None was around to monitor Jennifer after she eventually received her dose of Prostin to bring on labour. By the time we got someone to examine her more than six hours later, she was 5cm dilated and the baby was within two hours of arrival. Then came the other vital part of the husband's role: carrying all those bags (though thankfully not the birthing ball, left in the car boot) up and down the corridor as we searched for a vacant room in the delivery suite. </p> <p>Of course, those acupressure points and breathing exercises came in useful too. When Jennifer finally got hooked up to the gas and air, she liked it so much that she only wanted to breathe in, and I had to keep yelling \"Out! Out!\" like a deranged shop steward. </p> <p>I was immeasurably helped in all this - and more importantly, so was Jennifer - by the presence of her sister. If there is one piece of advice I will be boring prospective fathers with till my dying day, it is this: if you know anyone who is half-decent at massage and does not respond to stressful situations by talking too much, take them along with you. It meant one of us could help Jennifer through her contractions while the other went off on the inevitable midwife hunt. After the event, it also means there is someone else to help you piece together what happened. Jennifer - too wrapped up in pushing - was thankfully unaware of the last-minute panics. With the baby's cord around his neck, and his heart rate plummeting with every contraction, the midwife sent for a doctor with a view to using forceps. But luckily the built-in NHS delay paid off: the baby arrived before the doctor did. </p> <p>I watched the whole thing from my vantage point by Jennifer's head. This was the optimum position for me: at one remove from the blood and guts, I was perfectly placed to keep chanting my \"In . . . Out . . .\" mantra into Jennifer's ear (as much for my benefit as for hers, I suspect) and, more surprisingly, to be snogged by her between contractions. Our National Childbirth Trust teacher had warned us husbands about the point in labour when our wives would reject us and abuse us horribly. But Jennifer, as it happened, was completely loved up on Entonox (gas and air); she said later that the whole thing reminded her of a rave, the baby's amplified heart on the monitor supplying an erratic techno beat. </p> <p>At the time, it all seemed strangely matter of fact: here is his head; there goes his heart rate; is that the resuscitation unit they are wheeling out because it is on the blink? But at 5am the next day I woke up in a cold sweat as everything I had blithely sailed through over the last 12 hours hit me all at once. The baby could have died. Jennifer had a second-degree tear, the very idea of which made me want to cross my legs. Our building had been burgled while I was at the hospital - what if it had been our flat? Had anyone called the police? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I think this is when I realised that I had become a parent, and was condemned to a life of perpetual worry. </p> <p>In the ensuing week, thankfully, other things besides worry have jostled for prominence in my mind. Joy. A redoubled love for Jennifer, combined with a new sense of awe at her. Exhaustion, as much from the stream of visitors as from sleep deprivation. And wonder, at this little thing in my arms: his head, so heavy it feels like it could drop off in my hand; the ferocity of his appetite for milk (are we all born addicts?); the sensual charge of holding this hot little bundle. Watching his face as new expressions flit across from moment to moment, I wonder if I'll ever get tired of looking at him.</p> <p>\u0095 This is the first of a monthly column on becoming a parent, to be written alternately by Mike Torrance and his wife, Jennifer.

One is slotted more firmly than ever into a particular socioeconomic group, every sartorial nuance a living cliche. Yes, this new-found materialism is a precise art. It lies somewhere between a Bill Amberg sling and best-for-baby; between miniature cashmere and little bow ties with waistcoats. It means the best of Hennes and the cheapest of Boden. Subliminal advertising meets genuine need and gets muddled somewhere along the way. There is something delicious and covetable about Pampers baby wipes in their pleasant green packaging. Feeding equipment has to be Avent; otherwise, a sense of disappointment and doubt prevails. Strangely, this rabidly mundane form of desire leaves me feeling far from a drudgy saddo. It helps me feel like a domestic goddess. It's sick, I know. And I am going to read No Logo. As soon as I can afford the time.",

      "body": "<p>It was his ghostly pallor and refusal to eat supper that gave him away. Adam thought he was sick and suggested he lie down while the others ate. Later, after clearing up, Adam went up to his room - two flights, to the top of the house - to see if he was OK. Forgetting to knock, Adam opened the door to find Joe on his bed, joint alight. </p> <p>A few days short of his 16th birthday, we were having to deal with our son's cannabis use. It came as a surprise, despite the fact that we know the statistics on teenagers and drugs. There had been no telltale signs: no mood swings, no secretive behaviour, no cash shortages, no enlarged pupils - not even a whiff of smoke. Of course, we had talked about our attitude towards drugs and how we might deal with the issue when it arose. We just hadn't expected it to arise yet. A few weeks earlier, I had confidently, smugly told a colleague that my son was sailing through a trouble-free adolescence. </p> <p>Of course, we were not alone. Surveys in the 1990s showed that between a quarter and a third of 14- and 15-year-olds had tried drugs; and the number rose steeply after 16. Jack Straw's teenage son was caught offering it for sale. When Ann Widdecombe proposed a crackdown on users, seven shadow cabinet members said they had tried it. Last week, the government announced that police cautions for possession would no longer be part of a criminal record - a sign of changing attitudes to cannabis use. </p> <p>Adam called me as I was driving home. \"There's something you should know,\" he announced - words guaranteed to sink the heart at the end of a long day at work. Briefly, he told me what had happened. \"I've had a mellow chat to him already,\" Adam joked, making me giggle down the mobile, \"but I said we'd talk to him properly together when you get home.\" We agreed to discuss it alone first to establish a united front. </p> <p>I had half an hour in the car to work out my response. Adam and I had both smoked dope in the past, and had tried different drugs. But it was mostly in pre-parenthood days. Since that cloak of responsibility had settled on us, we had shared a joint at a party on less than a handful of occasions. We support decriminalisation of cannabis, and we both believe it is less harmful than tobacco or alcohol. We know that almost every teenager will try it, and we don't buy the argument that it leads inevitably to harder, more dangerous drugs. </p> <p>But this was our son, our baby. Surely that was different? Whenever I had ventured a liberal line on teenagers and dope with family or friends, I had been warned that I would feel a lot less liberal when it came to my own children. In that half-hour in the car, I first waited for an instinctive gut reaction to the news. When none came, I tried out various responses on myself. It felt like testing for pain, prodding and poking at myself, waiting for a sharp jolt that I could label. </p> <p>Was I shocked? Not really. I knew too much about the prevalence of cannabis smoking among teenagers. Was I angry? Not really. I remembered too much of my own teenage years for that. Alarmed? Sad? Trust betrayed? Not really. Curiously, I felt almost nothing. </p> <p>When I arrived home, I found Joe lying on the sofa, looking sheepish, with anxious eyes that betrayed his expectation of trouble. Adam was in the kitchen, sitting at the table with five - five! - joints in front of him. On being caught with a lit joint and an open bedroom window, Joe had quickly confessed: he had been smoking for about four months; he bought dope from a friend's older brother; he never smoked anywhere near school. The five spliffs were inside a cassette case lying on a chair next to his bed. Adam spotted them straight away and had brought the evidence to show me. </p> <p>We looked at the joints, then looked at each other. \"He rolls quite a good joint for a 15-year-old,\" said Adam wryly. \"What are we going to say?\" Within minutes, we established common ground. Neither of us thought this was a heinous crime, yet we didn't feel that we could give Joe our blessing. As Adam split open one of the joints to see how much dope was inside, I felt - at last - a proper parental response. It was, of course, mostly tobacco - the substance to which Joe had been consistently opposed throughout his adolescence, and one which I felt was far more dangerous and addictive than cannabis. We agreed a number of points to put to Joe, and called him in. </p> <p>It's a strange thing, being a parent. You remember your own teenage years all too clearly - the injustices, the humiliations, the rows, the bollockings, the slammed doors, the fury - and yet, inevitably, you find yourself 25 years down the line adopting the role of prosecutor, judge, executioner. You ask the same questions - \"What time will you be home? Where are you going? Who with?\" - that your parents asked you. And you hear your own teenage voice reply - \"Don't know. Why do you need to know? Leave me alone.\" As Joe came in the room, my mind went straight back to similar painful sessions with my own parents, when the last thing you want to do is \"talk it through\", but you know that is the minimum price you must pay for your transgression. </p> <p>So the three of us sat round the spliffs and talked it through. Actually, Adam and I did most of the talking. First, it's illegal, we said. You may not agree with that, and we may not either, but that's a fact: if you get caught, you'll be in trouble with the law. Second, if you smoke at school, or have it with you, and get caught, you will be expelled. Third, if you are buying dope from someone, sooner or later that person will offer you something different to try - and that's the point where we might be less tolerant. Fourth, you are more likely to come to harm from the tobacco in the joints than from the dope. Fifth, it's expensive and you have to decide what you want to spend your money on. Sixth, if you ever offer it to your little sister, we will break your legs. And so on. </p> <p>Joe said little, apart from telling us that \"everybody\" at his leafy-suburb school smoked dope. Really everybody? He qualified the figure to 90% of his friends and contemporaries. </p> <p>After 20 minutes of trying to ram home the dangers of harder drugs and tobacco, we asked Joe to go away and think long and hard about what we had said. We stared at each other, and at the spliffs on the table. Had we handled it right? Impossible to say. </p> <p>After about three minutes, the door opened and Joe's face poked round. \"Are you going to give me my dope back?\" he asked, tilting his head at the joints. We handed them over. </p> <p>Did we do the right thing? What is \"the right thing\", anyway? It's hard to navigate your way through parenthood, to know how much space to give; how protective or how tough to be. For something that so many people do, and so many have done down the years, parenthood has no definitive rules. The compass-points that guided my parents' generation are not necessarily relevant today, but neither does the experience of one's peer group always accurately reflect one's own rational views on a particular issue. So we muddle through, try not to be hypocritical, and hope for the best. </p> <p>Two weeks after our discovery, Joe doesn't seem any different from the loving, happy, intelligent, well-balanced teenager he was before. That said, when he burst through the door at the weekend, enveloped me then Adam in giant bear hugs, ate two bananas in quick succession, and launched into a long and rambling account of his plans to travel the world in a camper van, Adam caught my eye behind Joe's back. </p> <p>\"He's stoned,\" he mouthed. </p> <p>\u0095 All names have been changed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Have you been largin' it? Too many of us have, it appears. According to figures just released by the National Audit Office, obesity is costing Britain \u00a31.7bn a year. One in five adult women, and one in seven men, is now classed as obese. If that were not disturbing enough, it seems that weight problems begin early in life: research published in the British Medical Journal last week confirms that the number of preschool children medically classed as overweight or obese has almost doubled in the past decade. </p> <p>An analysis by Dr Peter Bundred at Liverpool University of health visitors' records for more than 60,000 children found that the proportion of overweight under-fours had risen from 14.7% to 23.6%, while in the same age group obesity had climbed from 5.4% to 9.2%. The findings hold little surprise for Margaret Lawson, head of nutrition at Great Ormond Street children's hospital. </p> <p>\"I've seen the most enormous toddlers put on diets,\" she says, \"although it's important to remember here that it's entirely natural for babies to be fat up until around a year old. After that, it's never too early to catch a child obesity problem. The longer a child remains obese, the harder it becomes to reverse, and the more likely they are to develop into obese adults.\" </p> <p>While the new tendency adds an unfortunate new meaning to the phrase \"Teletubby generation\", the phenomenon is not restricted to toddlers. Measured by body mass index, the rates of overweight and obese primary school children and teenagers are also rising. Child obesity is becoming a daunting problem. What, if any, is the answer? </p> <p>In the summer of 1999 Paul Gately, a senior lecturer at the school of leisure and sport stud ies at Leeds Metropolitan University, opened the Carnegie International Weight Loss Camp. Irreverently dubbed \"Fat Camp\" by the media, it remains the only one of its kind in the UK. </p> <p>Gately argues that the reason why kids are fatter today than 20 years ago has far more to do with declining physical activity than changes in diet. He points to statistics which prove that, over the past 50 years, we have greatly reduced our regular intake of calories and food, yet the national physique continues to swell. </p> <p>According to Gately, society - and particularly the powerful slimming industry - is to blame for fuelling the popular misconception that eating per se is the central cause of being overweight. \"The kids that come to our camp aren't addicted to food,\" he insists. \"What they're addicted to is inactivity - but that's the message you never hear.\" </p> <p>Working parents, who have less free time to spend enjoying exercise with their children, have quickly been blamed for the decline of physical activity among today's kids - and the complementary rise in the amount of time they spend, stationary, in front of TV and computer screens. But the truth is not so simple. </p> <p>Whether it is justified or not, parents' perception that it is no longer safe for children to play alone outside has undoubtedly played a role. So has the fact that physical education and sport have been slowly squeezed out of the national curriculum. </p> <p>\"Children no longer learn to run, throw, jump or catch at primary school,\" says Gately. \"Instead, they're learning football and basketball. Without good core skills, kids are bound to fail at specialist sport later, by which stage they'll conclude, 'I'm no good at this,' which is nonsense. It's not the kids who are failing, but the system.\" </p> <p>At the Carnegie summer camp, children - sometimes weighing in excess of 30st (190kg) - are placed on a portion- and calorie-controlled diet and a daily regime of six hours' exercise. Unlike the equivalent establishments in America, however, the priority at Carnegie is not to get children to lose huge amounts of weight. Gately's objective is to kickstart kids into managing their weight effectively by persuading them to make long-term changes to their lifestyle. With this in mind, participants are offered a spectacular variety of activities from which they can constantly choose, in the hope that when the children leave they will want to integrate exercise permanently into their home routine. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Marc Cullen, who has cut his weight from 18st to 14st (114kg to 89kg), will be returning to the camp for a third time this summer. \"I genuinely enjoyed the camp - if I didn't I wouldn't go back,\" he says. \"The staff give you the right attitude to exercise because they make it feel like fun. I still eat McDonald's; I eat the same stuff as I did before - but now I run or play rugby three times a week.\" </p> <p>A year after attending Carnegie, 15-year-old Gary Hipperson weighs 22st (140kg). He was 25st (159kg). Gary found that being among a sympathetic peer group helped: \"The confidence boost is dramatic and comes from the tutors, but also from spending a lot of time talking with other people in the same situation. I've stayed in touch with friends I made at the camp and met my girlfriend there.\" </p> <p>The issue of funding vexes Gately. He knows that the camp, at \u00a32,000 for six weeks, is beyond the budgets of many. In Belgium, where child obesity levels are lower than our own, the state runs a residential, year-round centre to treat severely overweight children. But, such is the lack of popular sympathy towards child obesity here, neither government nor private sponsors have been willing to support Carnegie. </p> <p>Many argue that it is primarily parents' responsibility to prevent their children getting so out of shape in the first place. Yet advice to parents faced with the reality of helping obese children can frequently seem confusing. They are told that children's food intake must be controlled, but that it is also vital to allow them autonomy - otherwise they will rebel. Subtle changes, such as keeping the fruit bowl full and the snack drawer empty, are supposedly the key to modifying an overweight child's environment without being too forceful. But it is easier said than done. </p> <p>Our children now live in an \"obese-genic\" environment which subliminally and continually prevents them from being more active. The omnipotent impact of technology and transport has effectively made life so easy that it is beginning to harm their health. </p> <p>At 15st (95kg), 14-year-old Rochelle McGuire is the only overweight member of her family. Until Carnegie opened, her mother, Linda, spent years taking her to see a series of medical professionals, but got nowhere as Rochelle's weight continued to escalate. </p> <p>\"If a child has anorexia or bulimia, there are specialists queueing up to help,\" says Linda, \"but we refuse to take child obesity in this country seriously. To send Rochelle back to camp this year, it's expensive and I'll have to take on two jobs to fund it. </p> <p>\"Ignoring this problem now will cost the government in 20 years' time, when all these children become obese 35-year-olds with severe health-related problems. It's so shortsighted.\"</p>",

Seventeen-year-old Marc Cullen, who has cut his weight from 18st to 14st (114kg to 89kg), will be returning to the camp for a third time this summer. \"I genuinely enjoyed the camp - if I didn't I wouldn't go back,\" he says. \"The staff give you the right attitude to exercise because they make it feel like fun. I still eat McDonald's; I eat the same stuff as I did before - but now I run or play rugby three times a week.\" A year after attending Carnegie, 15-year-old Gary Hipperson weighs 22st (140kg). He was 25st (159kg). Gary found that being among a sympathetic peer group helped: \"The confidence boost is dramatic and comes from the tutors, but also from spending a lot of time talking with other people in the same situation. I've stayed in touch with friends I made at the camp and met my girlfriend there.\" The issue of funding vexes Gately. He knows that the camp, at \u00a32,000 for six weeks, is beyond the budgets of many. In Belgium, where child obesity levels are lower than our own, the state runs a residential, year-round centre to treat severely overweight children. But, such is the lack of popular sympathy towards child obesity here, neither government nor private sponsors have been willing to support Carnegie. Many argue that it is primarily parents' responsibility to prevent their children getting so out of shape in the first place. Yet advice to parents faced with the reality of helping obese children can frequently seem confusing. They are told that children's food intake must be controlled, but that it is also vital to allow them autonomy - otherwise they will rebel. Subtle changes, such as keeping the fruit bowl full and the snack drawer empty, are supposedly the key to modifying an overweight child's environment without being too forceful. But it is easier said than done. Our children now live in an \"obese-genic\" environment which subliminally and continually prevents them from being more active. The omnipotent impact of technology and transport has effectively made life so easy that it is beginning to harm their health. At 15st (95kg), 14-year-old Rochelle McGuire is the only overweight member of her family. Until Carnegie opened, her mother, Linda, spent years taking her to see a series of medical professionals, but got nowhere as Rochelle's weight continued to escalate. \"If a child has anorexia or bulimia, there are specialists queueing up to help,\" says Linda, \"but we refuse to take child obesity in this country seriously. To send Rochelle back to camp this year, it's expensive and I'll have to take on two jobs to fund it. \"Ignoring this problem now will cost the government in 20 years' time, when all these children become obese 35-year-olds with severe health-related problems. It's so shortsighted.\"",

      "bodyText": "A small US agency was today given the task of advertising the Mini Cooper, icon of \"swinging 60s\" London, to the American public for the first time in 30 years. Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky will be paid around \u00a320m by Mini owner BMW to promote the revamped car as the ultimate accessory for the urban hipster. It is hoped the compact roadster will win over the hearts of US motorists more used to giant, gas-guzzling Pontiacs and Chevrolets. Mini's US marketing and communications manager Kerri Martin said she had chosen the Miami-based agency because she wanted the Mini to be marketed as a lifestyle choice, rather than a mass-market car. \"The Mini brand has a unique DNA to it. \"We were looking for a partner that also had that,\" said Ms Martin. It has not yet been decided whether the Mini's fashionable London heritage will be the mainstay of the US campaign. Unlike the innovative original, famously driven by the Beatles, the new Mini Cooper is a four-seat hatchback with a 1.6 litre engine. BMW, which bought the Mini brand from Rover, aims to build 100,000 of the cars a year. They will go on sale in the UK and Europe in the autumn. The car will not be introduced into the US until March 2002. However, Crispin Porter will develop a \u00a33m teaser campaign to break in the US late this year. BMW is using London agency WCRS to launch the Mini in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Billionaire US cosmetics mogul Ronald Lauder has won the first round of his legal fight with former Czech TV business partner Vladimir Zelezny. The dispute will shortly be coming to a UK court. Mr Zelezny has been ordered to repay \u00a318m to Mr Lauder's company, Central European Media Enterprises, by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court. But the stakes will be far higher next month. In March, Mr Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics dynasty, will begin his attempt to win \u00a3350m in damages from the Czech government for its role in the dispute with Mr Zelezny. The arbitration hearing will be held in London on March 5. Yesterday, the ICC heard Mr Zelezny had set up a Czech TV station in partnership with CME and was given a stake worth \u00a318m in the company, TV Nova. He then provided CME with a broadcast licence through his CET 21 firm. Mr Zelezny later sold his stake in TV Nova, took away the broadcast licence and began operating a rival service with it in the summer of 1999. Mr Lauder claims the Czech government did nothing to prevent Mr Zelezny's actions and violated a 1991 treaty between the US and the then Czechoslovak Federal Republic. He wants the Czech authorities to repay the money CME lost on the stock market once it was thrown out of TV Nova - around \u00a3350m. CME said it will pursue the \u00a318m payment from Mr Zelezny, despite the Czech businessman's claims he has sold his assets to prevent creditors from reaching them. Investors were so rattled by CME's reversal of fortune in the Czech Republic it was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US. Sources close to the dispute said it is vital Mr Lauder's claims are upheld, otherwise foreign investors will shy away from investing in the Czech media sector. \"This whole case is putting off potential investors looking at the Czech Republic,\" said one source. \"They are wondering where the protection is for companies like CME.\"",

When Peter Mandelson ran into trouble over the Hindujas' passport application, Mr Blair summoned the cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson to preside over the \"kangaroo court\" which removed the former Northern Ireland secretary from office. Dr Wright today made a powerful case for allowing MPs on his committee, which is one of the most influential in the Commons, to carry out such investigations in future. \"We do have a situation now where, in a sense, the verdict is pronounced before the investigation takes place,\" he said. \"If [ministers] are charged with something under the code of conduct they should have the chance to have an independent investigation because you have got the media howling for their blood, you have got a great furore inside parliament.\" His proposals are unlikely ever to come to fruition because Downing Street will be terrified of opening up the system to greater scrutiny. MPs, for example, would probably take a dim view of the way in which the ministerial code has been stretched by Downing Street in favour of the Europe minister Keith Vaz. Mr Vaz had a lucky escape. He was allowed to hold talks in his ministerial suite with an insurance company, on behalf of a friend, because the meeting was classified as \"constituency business\". Although Mr Vaz's friend does not live anywhere near his Leicester East parliamentary seat, he was classified as a constituent because the Foreign Office said that the Europe minister has a \"wider constituency\" among Britain's Asian community. They also admitted that the authors of the ministerial code never had such a definition in mind when they drew up the code. Allowing MPs, from all parties, to police the ministerial code would guarantee an end to such a wide interpretation of the rules. Such a reform may also have saved Mr Mandelson's career.

      "bodyText": "BBC1 won the head-to-head 10pm news battle with ITV for the first time last night. BBC1's Ten O'Clock News victory came on the back of a rare BBC1 peaktime ratings triumph, achieved by a drama line-up of EastEnders, Holby City and Silent Witness. BBC1's 10pm bulletin had 5.4m viewers and 27% of the audience, against News at Ten's 5m and 25%, according to unofficial overnights. The Tuesday-night ratings coup for BBC1 began from 7.30pm, as EastEnders captured 13.3m viewers and more than half of the available audience. From 8pm, Holby City got the better of The Bill on ITV. The BBC1 medical drama notched up 7.8 viewers and a 33% share, while The Bill had 7.4m viewers. Next up, at 9pm, Silent Witness retained Holby City's 33%t audience share and brought in 8.1m viewers for the BBC. At the same time on ITV, Peak Practice slipped to 6.8m - down 1.1m viewers on last Tuesday - and a 28% share. The strong BBC1 drama performances helped the channel to secure 34.4% of peaktime viewing between 7pm and 10.30pm, compared with ITV's 29.7%. But this morale-boosting ratings victory cannot hide the fact BBC1's peaktime schedule has been slow out of the blocks this year. It is now struggling to make up ground lost to ITV. ITV had a 38.9% share of peaktime viewing in the first six weeks of 2001, more than a percentage point up on the same period last year. By contrast, BBC1 is lagging three percentage points behind last year's 26% peaktime viewing figure for the same period. Elsewhere last night, Channel 5's movie the Long Kiss Goodnight proved popular from 9pm. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis teamed up to pull in 2.5m viewers and a 12% audience share.",

      "body": "<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is spiralling out of control in an orgy of blind hatred. Events of the past 36 hours offer a grisly contrast between the terror methods preferred by each side.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Israeli helicopter gunships 'took out' Masoud Ayyad, an officer in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 bodyguard, and a suspected Islamic militant.</p> <p>This morning, a Palestinian bus driver apparently went beserk, ramming his vehicle into a queue of passengers. At least eight were killed and a dozen more were injured, some seriously.</p> <p>Another new incident is being reported from the West Bank: a Palestinian man shot and seriously wounded, allegedly by an Israeli military hit squad.</p> <p>At first sight, there is no comparison between these horrible events. On the one hand, crazed fanaticism; on the other, calculated military ruthlessness. However, the contrast doesn't bear examination.</p> <p>There was nothing cold or calculated about the Israeli mob that gathered at the site of this morning's bus massacre, baying for Arab blood. Nor is there much restraint about a military policy that includes casual assassination.</p> <p>And, according to the skewed thinking of Palestinians today, there was nothing irrational in the behaviour of Halil Abu Olba, the bus driver who slammed into the Israeli bus queue near Holon, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. He will be hailed today as a hero, who did his bit for the cause in the best way he could.</p> <p>Olba is 35 years old and has five children, who he will not see again for a very long time. He was shot and wounded in the police pursuit of his bus, which ended when the vehicle crashed into a truck 10 miles south of Holon, and is now in hospital under police guard.</p> <p>It is not yet known whether Olba's grotesque action was premeditated or spontaneous. Either way, it has a surreal context that is central to the current bitter relationship between Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>Olba's home is in the Sheikh Radwan district of the Gaza Strip. Since the eruption of the al-Aqsa intifada at the end of last September, the territory has been mostly sealed off from Israel, partly for security reasons and partly as collective punishment.</p> <p>The 'closure' of the Gaza Strip, and of the West Bank, has caused untold hardship to two million Palestinians. Around 200,000 of them depend on wages earned in Israel, where employers are only too happy to exploit their cheap labour.</p> <p>In recent weeks the blockade has been eased slightly, to allow some 14,000 daily labourers to cross into Israel. They are supposed to have security clearance and their passage is tightly supervised at military checkpoints. In reality, as everyone in the region knows, thousands of Palestinians from the territories routinely work illegally in Israel.</p> <p>Olba, amazingly, appears to have been one of those. For five years he was employed by the Israeli bus company, Egged, to transport Palestinian workers from Gaza into Tel Aviv. Company officials have told local reporters that Olba's security clearance was withdrawn two weeks ago.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he was still at the wheel of an Egged bus this morning. If that seems bizarre, it pales by comparison with a military machine that now routinely assassinates those it suspects of being enemies, with the warm approval of the public and elected politicians.</p> <p>Col Masoud Ayyad, dispatched by a volley of missiles from a pair of Apache assault helicopters on Tuesday, was the 13th Palestinian to have been summarily executed during the intifada. (The Palestinians say at least 20 men have died in air strikes, or at the hands of Israeli hit squads).</p> <p>This morning brought news of a fresh shooting: Palestinians said that Iyaad Abu Harb, aged 24, was shot while travelling between Tulkarm and Nablus. They claim Harb, believed to be an activist in Arafat's Fatah organisation, was targeted by Israeli undercover forces in a failed assassination attempt. He is now in a critical condition in hospital.</p> <p>Last night, Palestinian gunmen rained bullets on the Jewish suburb of Gilo, in occupied east Jerusalem. Today, in the wake of the bus massacre, Israel reimposed its blockade of Gaza and the West Bank. There is, apparently, no end to the mutual madness.</p> <p><b>email</b><br><a href=\"mailto:dbrown445@aol.com\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian national authority</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian ministry of information</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is spiralling out of control in an orgy of blind hatred. Events of the past 36 hours offer a grisly contrast between the terror methods preferred by each side. On Tuesday, Israeli helicopter gunships 'took out' Masoud Ayyad, an officer in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 bodyguard, and a suspected Islamic militant. This morning, a Palestinian bus driver apparently went beserk, ramming his vehicle into a queue of passengers. At least eight were killed and a dozen more were injured, some seriously. Another new incident is being reported from the West Bank: a Palestinian man shot and seriously wounded, allegedly by an Israeli military hit squad. At first sight, there is no comparison between these horrible events. On the one hand, crazed fanaticism; on the other, calculated military ruthlessness. However, the contrast doesn't bear examination. There was nothing cold or calculated about the Israeli mob that gathered at the site of this morning's bus massacre, baying for Arab blood. Nor is there much restraint about a military policy that includes casual assassination. And, according to the skewed thinking of Palestinians today, there was nothing irrational in the behaviour of Halil Abu Olba, the bus driver who slammed into the Israeli bus queue near Holon, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. He will be hailed today as a hero, who did his bit for the cause in the best way he could. Olba is 35 years old and has five children, who he will not see again for a very long time. He was shot and wounded in the police pursuit of his bus, which ended when the vehicle crashed into a truck 10 miles south of Holon, and is now in hospital under police guard. It is not yet known whether Olba's grotesque action was premeditated or spontaneous. Either way, it has a surreal context that is central to the current bitter relationship between Israelis and Palestinians. Olba's home is in the Sheikh Radwan district of the Gaza Strip. Since the eruption of the al-Aqsa intifada at the end of last September, the territory has been mostly sealed off from Israel, partly for security reasons and partly as collective punishment. The 'closure' of the Gaza Strip, and of the West Bank, has caused untold hardship to two million Palestinians. Around 200,000 of them depend on wages earned in Israel, where employers are only too happy to exploit their cheap labour. In recent weeks the blockade has been eased slightly, to allow some 14,000 daily labourers to cross into Israel. They are supposed to have security clearance and their passage is tightly supervised at military checkpoints. In reality, as everyone in the region knows, thousands of Palestinians from the territories routinely work illegally in Israel. Olba, amazingly, appears to have been one of those. For five years he was employed by the Israeli bus company, Egged, to transport Palestinian workers from Gaza into Tel Aviv. Company officials have told local reporters that Olba's security clearance was withdrawn two weeks ago. Nevertheless, he was still at the wheel of an Egged bus this morning. If that seems bizarre, it pales by comparison with a military machine that now routinely assassinates those it suspects of being enemies, with the warm approval of the public and elected politicians. Col Masoud Ayyad, dispatched by a volley of missiles from a pair of Apache assault helicopters on Tuesday, was the 13th Palestinian to have been summarily executed during the intifada. (The Palestinians say at least 20 men have died in air strikes, or at the hands of Israeli hit squads). This morning brought news of a fresh shooting: Palestinians said that Iyaad Abu Harb, aged 24, was shot while travelling between Tulkarm and Nablus. They claim Harb, believed to be an activist in Arafat's Fatah organisation, was targeted by Israeli undercover forces in a failed assassination attempt. He is now in a critical condition in hospital. Last night, Palestinian gunmen rained bullets on the Jewish suburb of Gilo, in occupied east Jerusalem. Today, in the wake of the bus massacre, Israel reimposed its blockade of Gaza and the West Bank. There is, apparently, no end to the mutual madness. email dbrown445@aol.com Useful links Government of Israel Jerusalem Post Ha'aretz Jerusalem Report Palestinian national authority Palestinian ministry of information",

      "body": "<p>One of the pleasures of last year's presidential election was the number of jokes and stories that floated around the internet about the two main candidates. Every day, a fresh batch would arrive.</p> <p>Some were a bit juvenile and eventually most people tired of the examination of Bush's mangled syntax - although not enough to stop the publication of two recent books on the subject. Some, however, were sharp and funny and responded to all the twists and turns of the election.</p> <p>Now, alas, all is quiet. The Bush team is installed so - as the satirist Tom Lehrer said on a different occasion - who needs satire?</p> <p>What is needed now is for some sociology professor to trace the origin of these stories in the same way that some of our great urban myths have been located. How many of the jokes were original and how many adapted from past political jokes?</p> <p>I am particularly curious about one that has floated round again and seems to have a long-lasting currency independent of the last presidential round. Apologies to those who have read - or written - it before, but this is how it goes:</p> <p>A little boy asks his father what politics is. His father tries to explain. \"Well, son,\" he says, \"I go out into the world every day and make money - so imagine me as Capitalism. Your mother handles the budget for the house - so you could regard her as the Government. Your nanny, who looks after you and your baby brother, works very hard - so we will call her the Working Class. You are in the midst of all this - so consider yourself as the People. And your baby brother? Look on him as the Future.\"</p> <p>That night the boy goes to bed pondering his father's words. In the middle of the night he is woken by his baby brother crying, clearly wanting to have his nappy changed. He goes into his parents' bedroom and sees his mother fast asleep. He is unable to rouse her. He goes to the nanny's room and finds his father and the nanny making love. He tiptoes quietly out without being observed and goes back to bed.</p> <p>At breakfast in the morning, the boy says to his father: \"I was thinking about what you told me and I think I understand about politics now, dad.\" His gratified father looks up from his toast and asks, \"Oh yes, how is that?\" \"Well,\" replies the boy, \"Capitalism is screwing the Working Class.

      "bodyText": "One of the pleasures of last year's presidential election was the number of jokes and stories that floated around the internet about the two main candidates. Every day, a fresh batch would arrive. Some were a bit juvenile and eventually most people tired of the examination of Bush's mangled syntax - although not enough to stop the publication of two recent books on the subject. Some, however, were sharp and funny and responded to all the twists and turns of the election. Now, alas, all is quiet. The Bush team is installed so - as the satirist Tom Lehrer said on a different occasion - who needs satire? What is needed now is for some sociology professor to trace the origin of these stories in the same way that some of our great urban myths have been located. How many of the jokes were original and how many adapted from past political jokes? I am particularly curious about one that has floated round again and seems to have a long-lasting currency independent of the last presidential round. Apologies to those who have read - or written - it before, but this is how it goes: A little boy asks his father what politics is. His father tries to explain. \"Well, son,\" he says, \"I go out into the world every day and make money - so imagine me as Capitalism. Your mother handles the budget for the house - so you could regard her as the Government. Your nanny, who looks after you and your baby brother, works very hard - so we will call her the Working Class. You are in the midst of all this - so consider yourself as the People. And your baby brother? Look on him as the Future.\" That night the boy goes to bed pondering his father's words. In the middle of the night he is woken by his baby brother crying, clearly wanting to have his nappy changed. He goes into his parents' bedroom and sees his mother fast asleep. He is unable to rouse her. He goes to the nanny's room and finds his father and the nanny making love. He tiptoes quietly out without being observed and goes back to bed. At breakfast in the morning, the boy says to his father: \"I was thinking about what you told me and I think I understand about politics now, dad.\" His gratified father looks up from his toast and asks, \"Oh yes, how is that?\" \"Well,\" replies the boy, \"Capitalism is screwing the Working Class. The Government is asleep. The People are being lied to and the Future is in deep shit.\" If anyone could provide the origins of this story, which I have now seen in various forms, I am sure they will respond.

      "bodyText": "Michael Stone, whose convictions for the murders of mother and daughter Lin and Megan Russell were overturned last week, will face a second jury on the same charges in September, the court of appeal ruled today. Three judges rejected submissions on Mr Stone's behalf that he could not have a fair retrial because of \"prejudicial\" publicity about him following his original trial at Maidstone crown court in 1998. Mr Stone, 40, of Gillingham, Kent, was not present at the London courtroom as the court of appeal judges gave their reasons for ordering a retrial after quashing his 1998 convictions. Lord Justice Kennedy, reading from a 15-page written judgment, said that the central question in a new trial - expected to start on September 3 in Birmingham - would not be Mr Stone's character, but whether the evidence of the key prosecution witness could be believed. He said that, \"in justice to the Russell family and the wider community\", there should be a retrial to answer that question. The judge said: \"The retrial will not start until nearly three years after the October 1998 publicity, which is the principal target of complaint and people do forget. \"Even if they do not forget entirely the passage of time makes it easier for them to set aside that which they are told to disregard.\" Mr Stone was given three life sentences after being convicted of the two murders, and the attempted murder of Megan's sister, Josie, near their home at Chillenden, Kent, in 1996. The judges ruled last week that Mr Stone's appeal \"must succeed\" on the basis of the unreliability of key prosecution witness Barry Thompson, who gave evidence at Mr Stone's trial alleging he had confessed to the killings in prison. Lord Justice Kennedy said today that as a result of developments since the trial Thompson's evidence had been shown to be \"hopelessly unreliable\". Mr Stone's counsel, William Clegg QC, had argued that he could not have a fair trial because of \"prejudicial\" material in the media following the original trial. But Nigel Sweeney QC, for the crown, submitted that a fair trial was possible, saying: \"We in the criminal courts invest juries with good sense, good judgment and an ability within the trial to put out of their minds anything they might have heard before.\" Related articles 13.02.01: Justice in the spotlight 11.02.01:Rigging the scales of justice 07.02.01:Stone wins appeal as case collapses",

Patrick Morgan remembers that Arsenal drew 6-6 at Leicester five days before the 1930 FA Cup Final. \"David Halliday scored four for the Gunners: some might say it was odd then that he was dropped for the game at Wembley,\" he says. Meanwhile, Pete Watt points out that in October 1960, Brian Clough scored a hat-trick during Middlesbrough's 6-6 draw at Charlton.</p> <p>Finally, Paul McDonnell claims that in 1995 he saw an exhibition match between an all-German team and a Rest of the World XI that finished 9-9. \"Kevin Keegan, Bobby Charlton, Platini and a very over-sized Eusebio were in the World XI,\" he says. \"And Rummenigge, Gerd Muller and the Kaiser played for Germany. </p> <p>\"If you've ever seen your Dad play football, then you'll have a good idea what this game was like,\" he continues. \"It finished 9-9 with Keegan very close to being sent off. From what I remember, Jean-Marie Pfaff (who had been in goal for the World XI) had to go home, so Charlton went in goals for penalties. I think Germany won.\"</p> <p><strong>FASTEST HAT-TRICK EVER</strong></p> <p>In a previous Knowledge - <a href=\"\" \"http: football.theguardian.com news_story 0,1563,413983,00.html\"> click here </a> - we talked about the fastest ever hat-tricks in English football. Mark Redding, however, goes one better.</p> <p>\"I take it you know James O'Connor of Shelbourne FC, Dublin holds worlds fastest hat-trick record,\" he says. \"He scored three goals in two minutes and 14 seconds during a league game between Bohemians and Shelbourne in 1967 - and what's more, his feat is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records.\"</p> <p><strong>THE (NEARLY) 92 CLUB</strong></p> <p><strong>Having gone from First to Fourth Divisions in consecutive seasons, just how many of the League's 92 football grounds would a supporter of Wolves and Bristol City have visited if they had travelled to every away game (plus a game at home, of course) during that time? Which grounds would they have missed due to other teams being relegated or promoted at the same time?</strong> asks Kevin Chenoweth.</p> <p>The following assumes that all the poor bastards supporting Bristol City and Wolves stuck around for the Fourth Division campaign, and hadn't previously thrown themselves off a high building.</p> <p>City fans would have missed games at Leicester, Sunderland, Birmingham, Charlton, Rotherham, Barnsley, Sheffield United, Bradford, Wigan and Bournemouth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wolves supporters would also have visited 81 away grounds out of 91. They missed trips to Chelsea, Sheffield Wednesday, Newcastle, Bradford, Millwall, Hull, Swindon, Chester, Mansfield and Port Vale.</p> <p><strong>FIRST OFF</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Who was the first footballer to be sent off for a professional foul?\"</strong> asks Stuart Baxter.</p> <p>We've had two claims for this dubious honour. Chris West reckons Lawrie Sanchez, scorer of the winning goal in the 1988 FA Cup Final between Wimbledon and Liverpool, was the first to march for blatant cheating. \"Playing for Reading in the early 80s, he was sent off for a deliberate handball,\" he explains.</p> <p>But John Murray isn't so sure. \"I seem to remember at the beginning of the 80's John Lacy of Spurs being sent off at Goodison Park for tripping an Everton player on his way to goal,\" he writes. \"I saw the incident on TV and recall that there was a lot of fuss made about this particular sending-off. Could this be the one?\"</p> <p>John also points out that the decision to award red cards for such fouls \"came about largely because of the infamous Willie Young/Paul Allen incident during West Ham's victorious 1980 FA Cup Final appearance, when Young callously tripped Allen after he'd gone past him and was bearing down on the Arsenal goal.\"</p> <p><strong>CHANGING CAPTAINS</strong></p> <p>\"After watching the recent Sunderland versus Manchester United game at the Stadium of Light where Sunderland used three different captains (one sent off and the second injured), I was wondering if this was a record or does it happen often? asks Gavin Munro.</p> <p>Ben Homer says that during the 1986 World Cup game against Morocco, England had three captains in the same game. \"Bryan Robson went off injured, Ray Wilkins took over but was sent off, so Peter Shilton took over,\" he says.</p> <p>But as John Hudson points out, Sunderland actually used FOUR captains in the recent match against United. \"The initial captain, Gray. was replaced by Schwarz after he was sent off (47m),\" he says. \"Schwarz himself gave way to Thome as part of a reshuffle following Rae's red card (52m). And Thome was then replaced as captain by Makin after quickly picking up an injury (58m).\"</p> <p><strong>CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p> <p>\"Why, if their nickname is The Hornets, do Watford have a moose on their club badge?\" asks Martyn Amos.</p> <p>\"At the moment in Italy Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona.

Although they didn't win the Cup that year, they also won both ties staged at Roker, beating Notts County 3-0 and Stoke 4-0. And you say Manchester United call Old Trafford a fortress? NOT-SO-BORING DRAWS \"What was the highest ever drawn game in terms of goals scored?\" asked Gary Ross. Last week we dared you to advance on the two 5-5 draws we mentioned - click here - and you did not let us down. Dave Perrett and Paul Smith both remember Tranmere's titanic 6-6 tussle with Newcastle in the Zenith Data Systems Cup, perhaps the Mickey Mouse of all Mickey Mouse Cup tournaments. The game saw 12 goals, two hat-tricks (from Micky Quinn and John Aldridge), an amazing extra-time recovery from Newcastle (then managed by one Osvaldo Ardiles) as they came from 5-3 down to 6-5 up, as well as two penalties in the final minute of extra-time (the first to put Newcastle ahead, the next to put Tranmere level) before Tranmere finally won 3-2 in the penalty shoot-out.

Patrick Morgan remembers that Arsenal drew 6-6 at Leicester five days before the 1930 FA Cup Final. \"David Halliday scored four for the Gunners: some might say it was odd then that he was dropped for the game at Wembley,\" he says. Meanwhile, Pete Watt points out that in October 1960, Brian Clough scored a hat-trick during Middlesbrough's 6-6 draw at Charlton. Finally, Paul McDonnell claims that in 1995 he saw an exhibition match between an all-German team and a Rest of the World XI that finished 9-9. \"Kevin Keegan, Bobby Charlton, Platini and a very over-sized Eusebio were in the World XI,\" he says. \"And Rummenigge, Gerd Muller and the Kaiser played for Germany. \"If you've ever seen your Dad play football, then you'll have a good idea what this game was like,\" he continues. \"It finished 9-9 with Keegan very close to being sent off. From what I remember, Jean-Marie Pfaff (who had been in goal for the World XI) had to go home, so Charlton went in goals for penalties. I think Germany won.\" FASTEST HAT-TRICK EVER In a previous Knowledge - click here - we talked about the fastest ever hat-tricks in English football. Mark Redding, however, goes one better. \"I take it you know James O'Connor of Shelbourne FC, Dublin holds worlds fastest hat-trick record,\" he says. \"He scored three goals in two minutes and 14 seconds during a league game between Bohemians and Shelbourne in 1967 - and what's more, his feat is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records.\" THE (NEARLY) 92 CLUB Having gone from First to Fourth Divisions in consecutive seasons, just how many of the League's 92 football grounds would a supporter of Wolves and Bristol City have visited if they had travelled to every away game (plus a game at home, of course) during that time? Which grounds would they have missed due to other teams being relegated or promoted at the same time? asks Kevin Chenoweth. The following assumes that all the poor bastards supporting Bristol City and Wolves stuck around for the Fourth Division campaign, and hadn't previously thrown themselves off a high building. City fans would have missed games at Leicester, Sunderland, Birmingham, Charlton, Rotherham, Barnsley, Sheffield United, Bradford, Wigan and Bournemouth. Meanwhile, Wolves supporters would also have visited 81 away grounds out of 91. They missed trips to Chelsea, Sheffield Wednesday, Newcastle, Bradford, Millwall, Hull, Swindon, Chester, Mansfield and Port Vale. FIRST OFF \"Who was the first footballer to be sent off for a professional foul?\" asks Stuart Baxter. We've had two claims for this dubious honour. Chris West reckons Lawrie Sanchez, scorer of the winning goal in the 1988 FA Cup Final between Wimbledon and Liverpool, was the first to march for blatant cheating. \"Playing for Reading in the early 80s, he was sent off for a deliberate handball,\" he explains. But John Murray isn't so sure. \"I seem to remember at the beginning of the 80's John Lacy of Spurs being sent off at Goodison Park for tripping an Everton player on his way to goal,\" he writes. \"I saw the incident on TV and recall that there was a lot of fuss made about this particular sending-off. Could this be the one?\" John also points out that the decision to award red cards for such fouls \"came about largely because of the infamous Willie Young/Paul Allen incident during West Ham's victorious 1980 FA Cup Final appearance, when Young callously tripped Allen after he'd gone past him and was bearing down on the Arsenal goal.\" CHANGING CAPTAINS \"After watching the recent Sunderland versus Manchester United game at the Stadium of Light where Sunderland used three different captains (one sent off and the second injured), I was wondering if this was a record or does it happen often? asks Gavin Munro. Ben Homer says that during the 1986 World Cup game against Morocco, England had three captains in the same game. \"Bryan Robson went off injured, Ray Wilkins took over but was sent off, so Peter Shilton took over,\" he says. But as John Hudson points out, Sunderland actually used FOUR captains in the recent match against United. \"The initial captain, Gray. was replaced by Schwarz after he was sent off (47m),\" he says. \"Schwarz himself gave way to Thome as part of a reshuffle following Rae's red card (52m). And Thome was then replaced as captain by Makin after quickly picking up an injury (58m).\" CAN YOU HELP? \"Why, if their nickname is The Hornets, do Watford have a moose on their club badge?\" asks Martyn Amos. \"At the moment in Italy Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona. Are there any other younger brothers of big name players attempting to do likewise?\" asks Martin Casey. \"Which team has provided the most England international players?\" asks James McDonald. \"I am told it is Aston Villa.\" Send your answers to the.boss@theguardian.com.",

      "body": "<p>Antonio Salvador Polizzi was a 60-year-old pen salesman with a heart problem. Three years ago, when he woke up in the early hours of the morning with chest pains, his family rushed him to the Pedro Mallo naval hospital, a huge blue edifice studded with portholes in the Buenos Aires suburbs which was supposed to be one of the city's finest.</p> <p>Mr Polizzi never left the hospital. Five days later, on January 9 1998, he was dead. The family's distress was made all the more agonising by the fact that the hospital managed to lose his wedding ring, his watch and his clothes.</p> <p>To the rest of the world rushing through the hospital's corridors it was just another hard-luck story of a man whose time had come. But it was much more than that. The nature of Mr Polizzi's death and the deaths of other heart patients at the naval hospital are at the centre of a scandal which has shocked the Argentinian medical community and raised ethical questions over the explosive growth of the pharmaceutical industry's role in Latin America and the rest of the developing world.</p> <p>Six months after Mr Polizzi died, his widow, Aida, got a call from a state prosecutor, summoning her to his office. She thought it must be about the ring, but when the prosecutor told her what it was really about, she fainted. He said that her husband had been enrolled in a clinical trial for a new heart drug called cariporide. The family say this was without his knowledge. They have testified that the signature on the consent form was not his, and later tests have proved this according to the prosecutor who is still conducting his investigation.</p> <p><b> Forged</b><br></p> <p>\"It was not even close. The handwriting was completely different,\" Andrea Polizzi, the dead man's 26-year-old daughter said.</p> <p>At the date and time Mr Polizzi - the Argentinian representative for Cross pens - was supposed to have signed, he had been unconscious. He appeared to have had two separate clinical histories: one real, one forged, complete with bogus electrocardiograms which appear to have been taken from other patients' files.</p> <p>The Corgiolu family have a similar story to tell. Luis Antonio Corgiolu, a 66-year-old technical college instructor, had gone to the hospital with chest pains, and died the next day. The doctors said he had had a hole in his aorta, and there was nothing they could do. Six months later, the Corgiolus got a call from the prosecutor's office and were shown a consent form for the cariporide trial with Luis's name on it.</p> <p>\"But it wasn't his,\" Martin, his eldest son said. \"He always signed with his nickname, Lucho. This was his full name.\"</p> <p>When prosecutors looked at the consent forms for all 137 patients at the hospital who had been part of the trial, they found evidence that 80% of them had been forged. The files were also filled with duplicated electrocardiograms. The hospital says it will press charges against the accused doctors.</p> <p>Doctors had been offered $2,700 (\u00a31,900) for each person they recruited for the trial by cariporide's German-based manufacturers, Hoechst Marion Roussel. The family's claim that in pursuit of the cash, criteria set by the manufacturers for who should be included in the trial were ignored.</p> <p>At least 13 people included in the trials between 1997 and 1998 died. The chief prosecutor, Lucio Herrera, believes he has sufficient evidence to prove that three of the deaths were caused by the drug or the way it was administered. The evidence is likely to be hotly contested if and when the case finally comes to trial.</p> <p>No formal charges have yet been made, and there is no suggestion that Hoechst (now part of French-based Aventis Pharma), nor the US contractor it hired to carry out its Argentinian trials, Quintiles Transnational, were in any way responsible. Both Hoechst and Quintiles spotted irregularities in the spring of 1998 and alerted the hospital and the Argentinian authorities.</p> <p>But the case nevertheless demonstrates the dangers involved in the rapid expansion of clinical trials in Latin America, Africa and Asia. As increasing numbers of experimental drugs are emerging from the laboratories of Europe and the US, amid increasing pressure to deliver instant cures, the pharmaceutical companies are running out of suitable patients to act as guinea pigs in their home countries. The developing world is virgin territory, with millions of potential subjects. And in most cases they are being used to test medicines aimed not at them, but at the lucrative markets of the first world.</p> <p>In its May 2000 edition, CenterWatch, a newsletter for the burgeoning clinical trials business, published an exuberant article under the title Latin American Fever in which it said the continent \"may offer a unique opportunity to reach much larger numbers of study subjects.\"</p> <p>The pattern is replicated across the developing world. One of the world's top five drug companies, Eli Lilly, tested 590 patients in 1994 across Africa, the middle east and central and eastern Europe. This year the company expects to run tests in those regions on 7,309 patients.</p> <p>There are fears that this mushrooming of third world trials is leading to a loosening of the tight regulations that exist in the west. Recent US-government funded studies in Africa designed to show the effectiveness of the anti-Aids drug, AZT, in preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy, included a placebo group - a practice that would have been unacceptable in the US or Europe. AZT has been proven to save lives and so the denial of the drug to trial participants would not have been considered ethical.</p> <p>Concerned doctors attempted to persuade the US National Bioethics Advisory Board last November to establish rules so that US government-funded medical research would have to be overseen by a US review board, but the attempt failed, leaving international controls on the drug trial business patchy.</p> <p><b> Clinical trials</b><br></p> <p>In Buenos Aires, Luis Zieher, head of the medical ethics committee, said that eight years ago, his panel used to appraise three to four proposed drug trials a month. Now it examines up to 20 a month.</p> <p>There were about 200 clinical trials in Argentina last year, each one with up to two dozen different test sites (the naval hospital was only one of 26 Argentinian sites in the cariporide trials). Across Latin America there were more than 1,000 trials, according to Daniel Campos, an Argentinian oncologist whose company, Salud Uno, puts drug companies in touch with doctors interested in conducting trials. He said that number would increase tenfold in the next two years.</p> <p>\"This is reasonable,\" Dr Campos said. \"We have a huge population, in big cities, so it could be done. But we are also developing countries so we have big inefficiencies, so accidents can occur.\"</p> <p>The appearance before Christmas of a report on the scandal in the Washington Post caused outrage in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Norberto Pallavicini, a senior official at Anmat (the National Administration of Medicine, Food and Medical Technology) which oversees clinical trials, pointed out: \"Our medical facilities are recognised as the most important in Latin America. The trials are coming here because Argentina has credibility and the highest level of medical knowledge.\"</p> <p>Anmat has 30 full-time medical inspectors who have the reputation of being the best on the continent, but even he con cedes that his organisation is facing an \"explosion\" in the number of trials: \"We are not going to be able to supervise all the trials on a permanent basis.\"</p> <p>The doctor supervising the cariporide trials, Luis Garre, has been sacked by the hospital, but claims that he is innocent. In an interview with the Guardian at his flat, he said: \"I've been morally and professionally devastated.I've been left without work, and I've had to take the blows.\"</p> <p>Dr Garre denies cariporide was responsible for any deaths. It had been intended to limit damage to the heart after episodes of angina or bypass surgery, but the worldwide tests, involving more than 11,500 patients in 23 countries, showed little benefit.</p> <p>They also showed it to be safe when administered to patients with the targeted conditions.</p> <p>An Aventis spokeswoman, Lori Kraut, said that although the trials were called off, \"there were no safety issues in the discontinuation of the drug\". It is currently being tested for other possible medical uses.</p> <p>She insisted that doctors in the developing world were no more likely to break the rules than their counterparts anywhere else.</p> <p>Tomorrow: How drug companies bestow their favours on British doctors - the last in the series.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://guardian-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,437724,00.html\">Volunteers or victims?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,437723,00.html\">Crusading Indian firm takes on might of Glaxo SmithKline</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/bush/story/0,7369,437338,00.html\">13.02.2001: Industry that stalks the US corridors of power</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,437340,00.html\">13.02.2001: The biggest players</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4134705,00.html\">12.02.2001, John Le Carr\u00e9: A lot of very greedy people</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,436838,00.html\">12.02.2001, Madeleine Bunting: The profits that kill</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,436639,00.html\">12.02.2001, Larry Elliott: Profits triumph in a sick society</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,436832,00.html\">12.02.2001: At the mercy of drug giants</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,405579,00.html\">The issue explained: Aids crisis</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,421922,00.html\">14.01.2001: Drugs giants sue to cut HIV lifeline</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,421923,00.html\">14.01.2001: South Africa fights Aids drug apartheid</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,420645,00.html\">11.01.2001: Nkosi's last stand</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids\">Aids</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/bush\">George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pfizer.com/main.html\" target=\"_new\">Pfizer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/\" target=\"_new\">Glaxo SmithKline</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.astrazeneca.com/\" target=\"_new\">AstraZeneca</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.aventis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Aventis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.corp.aventispharma.com\" target=\"_new\">Aventis Pharma</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.novartis.com\" target=\"_&quot;NEW&quot;\">Novartis</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.quintiles.com\" target=\"_new\">Quintiles Transnational</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.centerwatch.com\" target=\"_new\">CenterWatch</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.elililly.com/about/community\" target=\"_new\">Eli Lilly community pages</a> <br><a href=\"http://corp.gsk.com/community/hivmother.htm\" target=\"_new\">Glaxo information on AZT trials</a> <br><a href=\"http://bioethics.gov/intl-research.pdf\" target=\"_new\">US national bioethics advisory board - ethics in international trials (pdf file)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.nih.gov\" target=\"_new\">US national institutes of health</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bettermedicare.org/who\" target=\"_new\">Citizens for better medicare</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.commoncause.org\" target=\"_new\">Common Cause</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Antonio Salvador Polizzi was a 60-year-old pen salesman with a heart problem. Three years ago, when he woke up in the early hours of the morning with chest pains, his family rushed him to the Pedro Mallo naval hospital, a huge blue edifice studded with portholes in the Buenos Aires suburbs which was supposed to be one of the city's finest. Mr Polizzi never left the hospital. Five days later, on January 9 1998, he was dead. The family's distress was made all the more agonising by the fact that the hospital managed to lose his wedding ring, his watch and his clothes. To the rest of the world rushing through the hospital's corridors it was just another hard-luck story of a man whose time had come. But it was much more than that. The nature of Mr Polizzi's death and the deaths of other heart patients at the naval hospital are at the centre of a scandal which has shocked the Argentinian medical community and raised ethical questions over the explosive growth of the pharmaceutical industry's role in Latin America and the rest of the developing world. Six months after Mr Polizzi died, his widow, Aida, got a call from a state prosecutor, summoning her to his office. She thought it must be about the ring, but when the prosecutor told her what it was really about, she fainted. He said that her husband had been enrolled in a clinical trial for a new heart drug called cariporide. The family say this was without his knowledge. They have testified that the signature on the consent form was not his, and later tests have proved this according to the prosecutor who is still conducting his investigation. Forged \"It was not even close. The handwriting was completely different,\" Andrea Polizzi, the dead man's 26-year-old daughter said. At the date and time Mr Polizzi - the Argentinian representative for Cross pens - was supposed to have signed, he had been unconscious. He appeared to have had two separate clinical histories: one real, one forged, complete with bogus electrocardiograms which appear to have been taken from other patients' files. The Corgiolu family have a similar story to tell. Luis Antonio Corgiolu, a 66-year-old technical college instructor, had gone to the hospital with chest pains, and died the next day. The doctors said he had had a hole in his aorta, and there was nothing they could do. Six months later, the Corgiolus got a call from the prosecutor's office and were shown a consent form for the cariporide trial with Luis's name on it. \"But it wasn't his,\" Martin, his eldest son said. \"He always signed with his nickname, Lucho. This was his full name.\" When prosecutors looked at the consent forms for all 137 patients at the hospital who had been part of the trial, they found evidence that 80% of them had been forged. The files were also filled with duplicated electrocardiograms. The hospital says it will press charges against the accused doctors. Doctors had been offered $2,700 (\u00a31,900) for each person they recruited for the trial by cariporide's German-based manufacturers, Hoechst Marion Roussel. The family's claim that in pursuit of the cash, criteria set by the manufacturers for who should be included in the trial were ignored. At least 13 people included in the trials between 1997 and 1998 died. The chief prosecutor, Lucio Herrera, believes he has sufficient evidence to prove that three of the deaths were caused by the drug or the way it was administered. The evidence is likely to be hotly contested if and when the case finally comes to trial. No formal charges have yet been made, and there is no suggestion that Hoechst (now part of French-based Aventis Pharma), nor the US contractor it hired to carry out its Argentinian trials, Quintiles Transnational, were in any way responsible. Both Hoechst and Quintiles spotted irregularities in the spring of 1998 and alerted the hospital and the Argentinian authorities. But the case nevertheless demonstrates the dangers involved in the rapid expansion of clinical trials in Latin America, Africa and Asia. As increasing numbers of experimental drugs are emerging from the laboratories of Europe and the US, amid increasing pressure to deliver instant cures, the pharmaceutical companies are running out of suitable patients to act as guinea pigs in their home countries. The developing world is virgin territory, with millions of potential subjects. And in most cases they are being used to test medicines aimed not at them, but at the lucrative markets of the first world. In its May 2000 edition, CenterWatch, a newsletter for the burgeoning clinical trials business, published an exuberant article under the title Latin American Fever in which it said the continent \"may offer a unique opportunity to reach much larger numbers of study subjects.\" The pattern is replicated across the developing world. One of the world's top five drug companies, Eli Lilly, tested 590 patients in 1994 across Africa, the middle east and central and eastern Europe. This year the company expects to run tests in those regions on 7,309 patients. There are fears that this mushrooming of third world trials is leading to a loosening of the tight regulations that exist in the west. Recent US-government funded studies in Africa designed to show the effectiveness of the anti-Aids drug, AZT, in preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy, included a placebo group - a practice that would have been unacceptable in the US or Europe. AZT has been proven to save lives and so the denial of the drug to trial participants would not have been considered ethical. Concerned doctors attempted to persuade the US National Bioethics Advisory Board last November to establish rules so that US government-funded medical research would have to be overseen by a US review board, but the attempt failed, leaving international controls on the drug trial business patchy. Clinical trials In Buenos Aires, Luis Zieher, head of the medical ethics committee, said that eight years ago, his panel used to appraise three to four proposed drug trials a month. Now it examines up to 20 a month. There were about 200 clinical trials in Argentina last year, each one with up to two dozen different test sites (the naval hospital was only one of 26 Argentinian sites in the cariporide trials). Across Latin America there were more than 1,000 trials, according to Daniel Campos, an Argentinian oncologist whose company, Salud Uno, puts drug companies in touch with doctors interested in conducting trials. He said that number would increase tenfold in the next two years. \"This is reasonable,\" Dr Campos said. \"We have a huge population, in big cities, so it could be done. But we are also developing countries so we have big inefficiencies, so accidents can occur.\" The appearance before Christmas of a report on the scandal in the Washington Post caused outrage in Buenos Aires. Norberto Pallavicini, a senior official at Anmat (the National Administration of Medicine, Food and Medical Technology) which oversees clinical trials, pointed out: \"Our medical facilities are recognised as the most important in Latin America. The trials are coming here because Argentina has credibility and the highest level of medical knowledge.\" Anmat has 30 full-time medical inspectors who have the reputation of being the best on the continent, but even he con cedes that his organisation is facing an \"explosion\" in the number of trials: \"We are not going to be able to supervise all the trials on a permanent basis.\" The doctor supervising the cariporide trials, Luis Garre, has been sacked by the hospital, but claims that he is innocent. In an interview with the Guardian at his flat, he said: \"I've been morally and professionally devastated.I've been left without work, and I've had to take the blows.\" Dr Garre denies cariporide was responsible for any deaths. It had been intended to limit damage to the heart after episodes of angina or bypass surgery, but the worldwide tests, involving more than 11,500 patients in 23 countries, showed little benefit. They also showed it to be safe when administered to patients with the targeted conditions. An Aventis spokeswoman, Lori Kraut, said that although the trials were called off, \"there were no safety issues in the discontinuation of the drug\". It is currently being tested for other possible medical uses. She insisted that doctors in the developing world were no more likely to break the rules than their counterparts anywhere else.

      "bodyText": "Many people in Dubai were shocked this week by news that the Gulf emirate's head of customs had been arrested on corruption charges, along with two of his most senior aides. The shock is not that the three men are accused of systematically creaming off tens of millions of dollars in bribes but that the crown prince, after a two-year investigation, has cracked down on such prominent officials. Dr Obaid Saqr bin-Busit, the customs chief, is not only a well-known figure in Dubai, but also a man of some standing internationally: last July he was elected chairman of the Brussels-based World Customs Organisation for a three-year term. In the Middle East, people are accustomed to a certain flexibility when it comes to customs duties and almost any other kind of government-imposed restrictions. People who belong to important families often regard themselves as above the rules, while others with less influence but sufficient money can have the rules bent by paying officials. Occasionally, however, something disrupts this cosy little system. Last summer, for instance, customs officials in Bahrain searched the cargo of a plane that was about to leave for Saudi Arabia. It belonged to a Saudi prince and, by the rules of Gulf etiquette, the officials had no business prying. Apologies followed and the plane took off, somewhat later than scheduled. But what the customs officials had found was interesting: 200 cases of whisky that, in the puritanical kingdom, could be sold under the counter for around $300,000 (\u00a3206,033). In most countries, customs officials would probably not insist on kings, presidents, popes and prime ministers opening up their bags for inspection, but in Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf, the number of VIPs who expect special treatment is enormous. There are, for a start, about 5,000 Saudi princes. It is difficult to see why they should all be entitled to royal privileges and why anyone should be spared the indignity of a search simply because they are in the entourage of someone who happens to be 4,723rd in line to the throne. The justification for these privileges is closely linked to the concept of honour - an essential part of Arab culture. To check a VIP at an airport for concealed weapons or contraband is to call into question his honour, even though there is ample evidence that such privileges are sometimes abused. The hijacking of a Saudi plane to Baghdad last October may be a case in point. Although the details are still unclear, it appears that the hijackers took advantage of the double standards applied in security checks to get their weapons on board. A further window into this murky world of privilege and bribery has been opened up by the arrest in Saudi Arabia of some 15 foreigners who are variously accused of alcohol offences, terrorism and murder. Three men - a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian were recently paraded on Saudi television confessing to two car bombings last November that killed one Briton and injured several others. Five Britons and four Americans (including one with intelligence connections) are among the others detained for alleged alcohol offences. With the possible exception of three Americans, all appear to know each other and to have been involved, one way or another, in a series of illicit drinking dens in the capital, Riyadh. The Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, has been at pains to point out that no Saudis are involved. The basic outline of the case (according to the Saudis) is that here were a group of foreigners engaged in illegal alcohol activities who got into some dubious business transactions - buying and selling stakes in their drinking dens - then fell out and started attacking each other. The televised confessions were certainly odd enough to cast doubt on their veracity but, either way, there is plainly a lot more to the story than has so far been disclosed. Prohibition of alcohol - as the US found in the early years of the 20th century - is extremely difficult to enforce, even in a puritanical country such as Saudi Arabia. The country's economy depends on foreign workers - labourers from poor countries in Asia and Africa, but also skilled westerners. Many of the westerners are happy to go there, attracted by generous tax-free salaries, or seeking to escape debts or personal problems back home. There are around 25,000 Britons living and working in the kingdom. Discouraged from mixing with the Saudis, they live in compounds with other expatriates and quickly become bored, drinking to pass the time. Possibly the illegality of alcohol in the kingdom adds a certain frisson of excitement that is not to be found by visiting a pub in Britain. The Saudis, meanwhile, recognise that it's necessary, up to a point, to tolerate these western habits. Although the religious police (the mutawwa) take a much tougher line than the ordinary police, the general approach is not to persecute drinkers who keep their activities to themselves and don't attract attention. But this raises the question of how to keep such large numbers of foreigners supplied with illegal alcohol. At one level, there is home brewing and some distilling, but that is basically a cottage industry and not enough to meet the demand. Smuggling of spirits - mainly whisky and gin - has become big business and most of it is said to pass through customs under the protection of royal privilege. Successful smuggling also depends on the existence of a distribution system and retail outlets - all of them technically illegal in the kingdom. What began with private drinks parties in people's homes therefore developed, eventually, into commercial-scale establishments resembling what, in Britain, would be regarded as pubs or clubs. The man credited with turning illicit drinking dens into a business is a Briton called Gary Dixon (also known as Gary Lyons and Gary O'Nions), who has just completed a short jail sentence in Dubai for crossing the border illegally and is now awaiting extradition back to Saudi Arabia. Although his Empire Club in Riyadh was busted three times by the religious police over a period of six years, Mr Dixon appears to have led something of a charmed life in Saudi Arabia. Former members of the club believe this was because his Saudi sponsor and a senior police officer received a share of the profits from the club. During his enforced leisure in Dubai, Mr Dixon wrote a book about his exploits on scraps of paper which have now been smuggled back to Britain, and he is looking for a publisher. This may well cast light on matters reaching far beyond Saudi Arabia's expatriate community. In the meantime, Prince Nayef's claims that the alcohol-and-bombs affair involves only foreigners is beginning to look a little thin. The arrests have certainly opened a can of worms. The question now is whether the prince will proceed to a more far-reaching clean-up, with all the embarrassment that that entails, or whether he will take the easier course and slam the lid back on.

      "body": "<p>For children across America, Christmas 2000 came tied in and branded. Whether Santa delivered a Rugrats \"snuggle blanket\", a 102 Dalmatians-themed salt shaker or a plastic waffle toaster bearing the lurid imprint of The Grinch, something tacky and movie-related would routinely be sitting under the tree. Unless, that is, they expected spin-offs from The Emperor's New Groove, a boisterous animated comedy set in a mythic South American province. Because, in a business where success is measured in merchandise, Disney's latest cartoon romp barely even registered. No snuggle blanket; no waffle toaster. Just a computer game, storybook and soundtrack - the last (in essence) half a new album by Sting. </p> <p>Not, sadly, that anyone wanted them anyway. Despite a release date of December 17 - with the promise of repeat visits by fractious kids during the school holidays - The Emperor's New Groove had, by Christmas day, already bombed. And then it bombed some more. And now, two months later, there is a $20m shortfall on its $100m budget, cementing the film's status as the present the American public didn't bother opening. This has a particular bathos, for the film was in development for six years, during which executives dithered, directors broke down, pop stars fumed, and a work-in-progress lay discarded in the cutting room, leaving observers wondering if Disney had finally lost the plot. </p> <p>Amid the bungling, even the title - that meaningless, off-putting title - was a botch, selected only as the least awful of the alternatives. Disney had already got rid of the original title Kingdom of the Sun, when the film began to resemble less and less its original conception, a loose reworking of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, set among the ancient Incas. </p> <p>But back in early 1995 the movie had looked the very safest of bets, particularly when veteran animator Roger Allers signed up as director. After all, Allers was a man with a name for commercial hits, the man who had recently taken a moribund screenplay called The Lion King and turned it into a massive success story. </p> <p>Which may be why Disney's then chairman Michael Eisner gave Allers such an unusually free rein with both the casting and the storyline. The movie was to be punctuated by eight musical offerings from Sting (hired on condition that his film-maker wife Trudie Styler could document the process), and Twain's story remained central to Allers's vision, its main characters the arrogant young royal Manco (voiced by comic actor David Spade) and humble lookalike Pacha (the fast-rising Owen Wilson). From there, however, the film took some distinctly arcane turns, veering into an involved sub-plot concerning an evil sorceress named Yzma and a self- consciously allegorical plan to steal the sun. Manco, by this stage, had turned into a talking llama. Obviously. </p> <p>The response at test screenings was tepid. Yet the mantra echoing through Disney's Burbank headquarters appeared to be: \"Remember The Lion King\". Busily sealing tie-ins with McDonald's and scheduling a release in the far-off summer of 2000, Disney remained convinced that, given enough time, Allers would turn up trumps once more. </p> <p>Until, inevitably, it changed its mind. It was now 1998. Allers was crawling towards completion; and, most importantly, Disney's follow-ups to The Lion King (the inane Pocahontas and ill-fated Hunchback of Notre Dame) had flopped. The studio had certainly done well in the meantime - but only thanks to its distribution deal with the recently formed Pixar, the company whose debut was the inspired Toy Story. It was decided that Allers's team needed an infusion of the zany. Enter Mark Dindal, a fresh-faced animator with a yen for slapstick. And so, over the next few weeks, the pair worked in tandem - Allers piling on the portent, Dindal churning out sequences as peppy as his colleague's were sober. The relationship couldn't last. </p> <p>The end came late that summer, when an executive strode into producer Randy Fullmer's office, held his thumb and index finger a quarter of an inch apart, and muttered - with the warmth studio executives are famous for - \"Your film is this far away from being shut down\". Shaken, Fullmer called Allers. Equally shaken, Allers demanded a deadline extension. The request was denied, and he quit the project. Upon hearing the news, an apoplectic Eisner gave Fullmer two weeks to prove the movie was viable. </p> <p>In a state of panic, Fullmer and Dindal set to work. They eviscerated Allers's screenplay, keeping in what test audiences had liked and abandoning what they didn't. And, mostly, what they didn't like was the whole thing. A fortnight later, Dindal re-emerged with the outline of a mildly hip buddy movie, in which Pacha was now a slobbish yokel voiced by John Goodman and the sun stayed firmly where it was. Manco, meanwhile, had been renamed Kuzco following Fullmer's horrified discovery of the Japanese slang term omanco (polite translation: vagina). He still turned into a llama. Eisner, with $25m already sunk into the film, swallowed his reservations and gave it the green light. Again. </p> <p>The fun didn't end there. It would take another six months to get the retitled Emperor's New Groove back in production. A deadline extension was now granted to Dindal, with Disney's prehistoric epic Dinosaur yanked forward to summer 2000 to compensate. And then there was the Sting problem - that, with most of the original movie gone, all his songs except one were suddenly surplus to requirements. The call was not one Fullmer was looking forward to. He would surely have looked forward to it even less had he known Trudie Styler would be filming her husband just as the phone rang. The subsequent exchange soon became the centrepiece of Styler's documentary The Sweatbox, about to open in the US and prove for the record which is more tempting to audiences: an \"angry and perturbed\" Sting being dispatched, or a talking llama. </p> <p>And finally the film was ready. The reviews, unexpectedly, were good. Since it was released in direct competition with Disney's own 102 Dalmatians, the box office receipts were not. At the end of its opening week, The Emperor's New Groove banked just over $9m. The Grinch, by comparison, made $55m in its first seven days. It was the studio's worst-performing animation in four years. The last holder of that record, Hercules, had cost $30m less to make. </p> <p>Which only leaves the post-mortems. Within days of the film's opening, the industry was alive with whispers that the wrong Kingdom of the Sun had been given the go-ahead; that both versions were doomed by the incompetence of middle- management; and that the real reason Allers's grandiose vision was ditched had nothing to do with release dates and everything to do with smaller budgets. </p> <p>And, most damagingly, the perfectionist, money-no-object Disney, which revolutionised movie animation with Fantasia and its ilk, was discredited. So, as The Emperor's New Groove arrives in the UK, spare a thought for Roger Allers, for Mark Dindal, and even for Sting. And be sure to listen out for Uncle Walt spinning furiously in his grave. </p> <p>\u0095 The Emperor's New Groove is out on Friday.</p>",

Liberal Democrat dome spokesman Norman Baker said: \"The government is skating on thin ice by dragging out is discussions with the Legacy consortium. Until now, it has been assumed that Pierre-Yves Gerbeau will be there to pick up the pieces if Legacy pulls out of the proposed deal.\" \"In the light of Mr Gerbeau's comments it is now vital that the cabinet sticks to the original timetable for the Legacy deal. Otherwise it faces the prospect of an empty dome come election day.\" Related articles 14.02.2001: Gerbeau ridicules Legacy dome bid 13.02.2001: Snub by duke triggers new dome controversy 11.02.2001: Legacy secures major dome backer 08.02.2001: Deal on dome goes to the wire 01.01.2001: Gerbeau keeps bid alive Useful links Legacy plc",

      "body": "<p>The battle for Oscar glory threw up a straight scrap yesterday between Gladiator and the martial arts high-kicking of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. British director Ridley Scott's sprawling Roman epic - the first since the genre fell from favour in the 60s - in which a leafy corner of suburban Surrey passes for the wild barbarian frontier, took 12 nominations in all, closely followed by Ang Lee's surprise Chinese arthouse hit with 10, the highest ever number for a foreign language film.</p> <p>Scott, whose Hannibal is currently taking the US box office by storm, said: \"Sadly, I lost my mum this week but obviously she is still looking after me. Thanks mum and the academy. Twelve nominations is fantastic. Needless to say, I am absolutely thrilled.\"</p> <p>Stephen Daldry's heart-warming Billy Elliot, about a miner's son who wants be a ballet dancer, always had its work cut out to muscle in on such heavyweight macho company, but the Royal Court man did match his fellow theatre director Sam Mendes's coup by picking up a best director nomination for his first film.</p> <p>There was joy too at the best actress nomination for Julie Walters, who played the boy's dance teacher, and best screenplay nod for Lee Hall, the Newcastle writer best known for Cooking With Elvis and his radio play Spoonface Steinberg.</p> <p>The celebrations were soured, however, by the fact that Jamie Bell, the film's 14-year-old star, missed out. \"It's terribly disappointing for him. We are all sad about it,\" said Walters, who was pipped at the post herself for Educating Rita. \"It's a shame, but he's only 14 - he's got the whole of his life ahead of him. And if you win an Oscar at 14 what have you got to look forward to? Everything's going to be a disappointment.\"</p> <p><b> Superior weepie</b><br></p> <p>Hall also felt for Bell. \"Jamie was so fantastic in the film. I think he's fallen foul of the politics of these things. The fact that we have been nominated is as much a testament to him as it is to ourselves.\"</p> <p>There was better news for the veteran Albert Finney, who was picked out for his supporting role in Erin Brockovich - the fifth time he has been nominated - while Judi Dench confirmed her popularity in Hollywood with another nomination for the superior weepie Chocolat, her third in three years.</p> <p>However, Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones's fairytale few years - motherhood, stardom and marriage to Michael Douglas - did not have the much-hyped happy ending of a nomination for her performance in Traffic.</p> <p>The most intriguing battle, however, could be in the best director category where many see Britain's best chances lying. As well as Daldry, Scott and Ang Lee, Steven Soderbergh has been nominated both for Traffic and Erin Brockovich.</p> <p>But it was the name Javier Bardem which prompted the one unsuppressed cheer of the morning when the nominations were announced to press at 5.30am at a storm-lashed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to catch the east coast breakfast headlines.</p> <p>The Spanish actor, best known for his sex-charged performance in Jamon Jamon, won plaudits for portraying the late Cuban gay writer Reinaldo Arenas in Before Night Falls. He will be competing with two-times winner Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Geoffrey Rush (Quills) and Ed Harris (Pollock).</p> <p>There was no surprise that Julia Roberts should be nominated for Erin Brockovich and her fellow nominees were also those who had been most heavily tipped: Juliette Binoche (Chocolat), Ellen Burstyn (Requiem for a Dream), Joan Allen (The Contender) and Laura Linney (You Can Count on Me). Though not nominated for her remarkable performance in Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, Bjork does feature in the best song category for the song she co-wrote, I've Seen It All.

      "bodyText": "The battle for Oscar glory threw up a straight scrap yesterday between Gladiator and the martial arts high-kicking of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. British director Ridley Scott's sprawling Roman epic - the first since the genre fell from favour in the 60s - in which a leafy corner of suburban Surrey passes for the wild barbarian frontier, took 12 nominations in all, closely followed by Ang Lee's surprise Chinese arthouse hit with 10, the highest ever number for a foreign language film. Scott, whose Hannibal is currently taking the US box office by storm, said: \"Sadly, I lost my mum this week but obviously she is still looking after me. Thanks mum and the academy. Twelve nominations is fantastic. Needless to say, I am absolutely thrilled.\" Stephen Daldry's heart-warming Billy Elliot, about a miner's son who wants be a ballet dancer, always had its work cut out to muscle in on such heavyweight macho company, but the Royal Court man did match his fellow theatre director Sam Mendes's coup by picking up a best director nomination for his first film. There was joy too at the best actress nomination for Julie Walters, who played the boy's dance teacher, and best screenplay nod for Lee Hall, the Newcastle writer best known for Cooking With Elvis and his radio play Spoonface Steinberg. The celebrations were soured, however, by the fact that Jamie Bell, the film's 14-year-old star, missed out. \"It's terribly disappointing for him. We are all sad about it,\" said Walters, who was pipped at the post herself for Educating Rita. \"It's a shame, but he's only 14 - he's got the whole of his life ahead of him. And if you win an Oscar at 14 what have you got to look forward to? Everything's going to be a disappointment.\" Superior weepie Hall also felt for Bell. \"Jamie was so fantastic in the film. I think he's fallen foul of the politics of these things. The fact that we have been nominated is as much a testament to him as it is to ourselves.\" There was better news for the veteran Albert Finney, who was picked out for his supporting role in Erin Brockovich - the fifth time he has been nominated - while Judi Dench confirmed her popularity in Hollywood with another nomination for the superior weepie Chocolat, her third in three years. However, Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones's fairytale few years - motherhood, stardom and marriage to Michael Douglas - did not have the much-hyped happy ending of a nomination for her performance in Traffic. The most intriguing battle, however, could be in the best director category where many see Britain's best chances lying. As well as Daldry, Scott and Ang Lee, Steven Soderbergh has been nominated both for Traffic and Erin Brockovich. But it was the name Javier Bardem which prompted the one unsuppressed cheer of the morning when the nominations were announced to press at 5.30am at a storm-lashed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to catch the east coast breakfast headlines. The Spanish actor, best known for his sex-charged performance in Jamon Jamon, won plaudits for portraying the late Cuban gay writer Reinaldo Arenas in Before Night Falls. He will be competing with two-times winner Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Geoffrey Rush (Quills) and Ed Harris (Pollock). There was no surprise that Julia Roberts should be nominated for Erin Brockovich and her fellow nominees were also those who had been most heavily tipped: Juliette Binoche (Chocolat), Ellen Burstyn (Requiem for a Dream), Joan Allen (The Contender) and Laura Linney (You Can Count on Me). Though not nominated for her remarkable performance in Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, Bjork does feature in the best song category for the song she co-wrote, I've Seen It All. Bob Dylan (Wonder Boys) and Randy New man (Meet the Parents) are also listed. Missing in action was Michael Douglas, who had been tipped for nominations as both best actor and best supporting actor for Wonder Boys and Traffic. He lost out to Ed Harris whose portrayal of painter Jackson Pollock has won critical acclaim. Marcia Gay Harden won a best supporting actress nomination for her role in the same film and will be competing for votes with Julie Walters, Judi Dench, Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand.

George Monbiot writes mainly about Britain in a terse investigative style that I had feared was out of date. Naomi Klein, based in Canada, ranges all over the world and writes infectiously with verve and passion. Again and again their themes converge. Both contemptuously reject the view, which seemed supreme after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and what used to be known (quite wrongly) as communism, that the world is now set fair on a course to libertarian capitalist prosperity. Instead of the torch of freedom, Klein writes, \"it seems that it may be the torch of authoritarianism that is being carried by those determined to go global.\" Both identify the chief menace of the modern world as the multinational corporations and their unelected boardrooms. Both suggest that the power and greed of these corporations is rapidly overtaking what is left of the power and responsibility of elected governments. Both revel in the growing anger against this menace, from the spontaneous protests against antisocial roads and supermarkets to the demonstrations which over the last two years have taken London, Seattle, Prague and Nice by storm and threaten every future international meeting of trade ministers.</p> <p>\"The struggle between people and corporations,\" Monbiot writes, \"will be the defining battle of the 21st century\"; and he sets out to prove his point by telling a series of shocking stories from contemporary Britain: the scandal of the toll bridge over the sea to Skye whose financiers - originally the Bank of America - will pocket \u00a388m in tolls from a bridge which originally cost someone else (mostly the British and European taxpayer) \u00a325m; the profit-based ramp known as PFI which now dominates almost all government construction policy, the most glaring example of which is the building of new hospitals at public expense for private gain (with the resulting loss of thousands of hospital beds); the flouting of planning regulations by house-builders and supermarket chains; the wresting of control of the food and drug industry by the big food and drug companies, especially those making genetically modified foods; the surrender of academic objectivity to corporate greed in the universities, led by the proudest and oldest. He lists eight professorships at Cambridge named after and financed by big corporations: Shell, BP, ICI, Glaxo, Unilever, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Marks and Spencer. He records that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors decided in 1998 to stop taking money for cancer research from the tobacco industry, but notes that before the ban was imposed Cambridge accepted \u00a31.6m from British American Tobacco to establish a Chair of International Relations named after BAT's former chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy. Though he is chiefly concerned with Britain, Monbiot sees what is happening here in a wider context, recognising that international \"trade agreements have become the greatest threats to representative government.\" He describes how groups of businessmen meeting in secret under the auspices of shadowy international organisations such as the European Round Table and the Transatlantic Business Dialogue are setting up their own regulatory system, which makes boycotts of oppressive regimes such as that in Burma, for instance, almost impossible. They enforce this new concept of the rule of law by trade boycotts of their own, which are far more powerful than sanctions imposed by recognised international organisations under the United Nations.</p> <p>Two factors are crucial: confidentiality and the shrivelling power of elected governments. Whereas governments pretend that their decisions are open and subject to debate, and scientists publicly insist that progress depends on sharing and publicising information, corporations seek to protect themselves, their decisions and their funds from public scrutiny. Thus the inhabitants of Skye, confronted with a bill for costs connected with the toll bridge, \"have no means of discovering whether or not the costs are fairly incurred. Indeed, as Miller Civil Engineering won't tell them, they are unable to discover how much nearer they are to paying off the bridge than they were when it opened.\" As for the current obsession with privately built roads, there are two conflicting official stories. The Government's Highways Agency, deeply influenced by the private roads lobby, announced that private roads were 15 per cent cheaper than those funded by the state. Whoops! The National Audit Office conducted a detailed investigation into the first four privately built roads and found that two were more expensive than they would have been had they been publicly funded. Who was right? When the campaigning group Transport 2000 tried to find out, they were told by the Highways Agency that the figures were \"commercially confidential\". As for science, Monbiot writes: \"While openness has long informed the ethics of science, corporations demand confidentiality. Information that the companies find uncomfortable can be withheld, even when it arises from projects half-funded by the government.\" Again and again the sponsors of such projects disguise their costs from the people who are partly, often mostly, funding them. This new craze for commercial confidentiality has not been in the least affected by the government's new Freedom of Information Act which, unlike its counterpart in the US, will prove absolutely useless in busting open the padlocks so firmly clamped on these important statistics.</p> <p>As for the dwindling power of elected governments, Monbiot started his book in May 1997, the month Labour was elected to office with an impregnable majority. He gives no clue as to what he expected from the new ministers, and certainly there is no trace of any ideological commitment that would have set him against them. But what he has written emerges, almost incidentally, as the most sustained indictment of the Blair administration yet published. As the ministers' names fluttered past my eyes, I found myself remembering each of them in their days as radical reformers: Brian Wilson, once abrasive editor of the West Highland Free Press and socialist champion of the Scottish Highlands, now defending the government's policies on the bridge to Skye; Nick Raynsford, whom I recall coming to see me at the Daily Mirror to seek more publicity for the single homeless people in whose interests he was then battling, now as Planning and Construction Minister swanning round the world with executives from the construction industry, including (several times) Balfour Beatty, the potential privatisers of the London tube and the company which holds the record for the biggest fine ever imposed under health and safety legislation, even before the authorities have fully investigated its crucial role in track maintenance at Hatfield; Jack Straw, radical campaigner for public enterprise from Barbara Castle's former seat, who in May 1996 told the Prison Officers Association that privatisation of the prisons was \"morally unacceptable - this is one area where a free market does not exist,\" and promised to take any privatised prisons back into public ownership \"as soon as contractually possible\", now as home secretary negotiating with yet more big corporations for the privatisation of yet more prisons; 'bluff John' Prescott, the authentic voice of proletarian old Labour, who made it \"crystal clear\" to the 1993 Labour party conference that a Labour government would renationalise the railways if the Tories privatised them, and promised, for instance, that the Birmingham relief road would be built \"only over my dead body\", now, as Huff and Puff John, presiding over the privatised railways during their most disastrous period since before nationalisation fifty years ago - as well as giving the go-ahead for the Birmingham relief road. John P's soul may be mouldering in the grave but his body goes marching on.</p> <p>The list of ministers once critical of the corporations but now slavishly supporting them goes on and on throughout the book: Geoffrey Robinson who, as paymaster general, defended the PFI proposals (and the loss of beds) for Walsgrave Hospital in his constituency, and then, when he lost office, rediscovered his opposition to the plan; Alastair Darling, who in opposition denounced the failure to disclose taxpayers' contributions to PFI projects as \"inexcusable\" but who has not objected to the same failure to disclose PFI figures under his stewardship of the Department of Social Security; Stephen Byers, who as former chair of the Council of LEAs again and again denounced the Tories for the privatisation of education but has stood solidly in support of privatisation and deregulation as trade and industry secretary; and last but by no means least, the genetically modified science minister himself, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who has achieved the all-time record for a serving minister donating private money to the party which made him a minister - in his case at least \u00a34m.</p> <p>The Blair government is now almost entirely servile to its masters in big business. Any minister who for a moment threatened the corporations - David Clark on freedom of information, Nigel Griffiths on consumer influence, Mark Fisher on the arts - has been summarily sacked. Meanwhile, corporation tax and capital gains tax have been cut to ribbons, but income tax has stayed the same. The theoretical regulators of corporate power have become its champions.</p> <p>Naomi Klein's book takes off when she reflects on her college obsessions with gender and race discrimination. \"Our criticism, focused on women and minorities, assumed an atmosphere of plenty . . . class fell off the agenda . . . we were too busy analysing pictures on the wall to notice that the wall had been sold.\" This worried her and her worries led her to the places where 'branded' goods are made, especially to the 'industrial slums' of the Philippines, where half a million people, most of them women, are hoarded into free trade zones and obliged to work in conditions which hark back to the darkest years of industrialisation in the US and Britain. At Cavite in the Philippines she found three vital ingredients required by the contractors to the big US clothing and computer corporations: \"tax breaks, lax regulations and the services of a military willing and able to crush labour unrest\". Here was everything a corporate executive dogged by regulations and recognised trade unions at home could wish for: not just luxury housing, golf courses and an ample supply of cheap domestic servants (they could get most of these back home) but rules against talking and smiling in the factories similar to those contested in Lancashire and Cheshire a hundred years ago. The workers in Cavite are shovelled into stinking dormitories, scratch out a living on starvation wages and are warned every day of the terrible sanctions awaiting anyone who talks to a union organiser. These chapters about exploitation lead Klein on to what she calls the \"bad mood rising\", the discontent which first raged in Seattle in November 1999. The corporations, she argues, \"are stunting human development . . . what good is an open and accountable parliament if economic policy is unchanged?\"</p> <p>Shelley wrote that some atrocity on the part of the wealthy set \"the blood boiling in indignation in my veins\". Ever since I first read that, I've subjected any new political analysis to a BBIV (blood boiling in veins) test. Do these two books pass? The unequivocal answer in both cases is 'yes'. The blood boils all right, both at the corporate exploiters and the politicians who dance to their tune. But as the blood boils, so the mind casts around for a solution. Both authors anticipate this yearning, but they deal with it unsatisfactorily. Both have rejected conventional arenas for political dissension - councils, parliaments etc - and both champion the admirable protests of organisations like Reclaim the Streets. But that seems the limit of their advice. Monbiot concludes that \"corporations are powerful only because we allow them to be\" and will cease to be so when \"people reassert their control\" (when did we ever have this control?). He goes on: \"Our strength lies in our citizenship, in our ability to engage in democratic politics.\" This means, he concludes, \"putting the demo back in democracy\". Klein ends her book in much the same way. \"We will find our way out as citizens on our own. Political solutions deserve another shot.\" These optimistic formulae come at the end of analyses which prove in devastating fashion that the corporate power that rules our lives and our parliaments is backed by the most enormous resources of economic wealth. This power can be shaken and even deflected by vigorous mass protest such as took place at Seattle and at Nice. But if it is to be defeated and transformed, there has to be a power on our side big enough to hurt the corporations where they hurt most, in their pockets; and go on hurting them there.</p> <p>At the end of her book Klein describes a discussion about international codes of business conduct among a gang from the Workers Assistance Centre in Rosario in the Philippines. One worker, Zernon Toledo, pounded the table. \"These documents,\" he bellowed, 'are written by the transnational corporations, so that they will only serve the transnational corporations - haven't you read Marx?\" This seemed to me a fair question, if a little patronising. The indignation which these books ignite needs more food for its flames than vague appeals to citizenship.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

The Government's Highways Agency, deeply influenced by the private roads lobby, announced that private roads were 15 per cent cheaper than those funded by the state. Whoops! The National Audit Office conducted a detailed investigation into the first four privately built roads and found that two were more expensive than they would have been had they been publicly funded. Who was right? When the campaigning group Transport 2000 tried to find out, they were told by the Highways Agency that the figures were \"commercially confidential\". As for science, Monbiot writes: \"While openness has long informed the ethics of science, corporations demand confidentiality. Information that the companies find uncomfortable can be withheld, even when it arises from projects half-funded by the government.\" Again and again the sponsors of such projects disguise their costs from the people who are partly, often mostly, funding them. This new craze for commercial confidentiality has not been in the least affected by the government's new Freedom of Information Act which, unlike its counterpart in the US, will prove absolutely useless in busting open the padlocks so firmly clamped on these important statistics. As for the dwindling power of elected governments, Monbiot started his book in May 1997, the month Labour was elected to office with an impregnable majority. He gives no clue as to what he expected from the new ministers, and certainly there is no trace of any ideological commitment that would have set him against them. But what he has written emerges, almost incidentally, as the most sustained indictment of the Blair administration yet published. As the ministers' names fluttered past my eyes, I found myself remembering each of them in their days as radical reformers: Brian Wilson, once abrasive editor of the West Highland Free Press and socialist champion of the Scottish Highlands, now defending the government's policies on the bridge to Skye; Nick Raynsford, whom I recall coming to see me at the Daily Mirror to seek more publicity for the single homeless people in whose interests he was then battling, now as Planning and Construction Minister swanning round the world with executives from the construction industry, including (several times) Balfour Beatty, the potential privatisers of the London tube and the company which holds the record for the biggest fine ever imposed under health and safety legislation, even before the authorities have fully investigated its crucial role in track maintenance at Hatfield; Jack Straw, radical campaigner for public enterprise from Barbara Castle's former seat, who in May 1996 told the Prison Officers Association that privatisation of the prisons was \"morally unacceptable - this is one area where a free market does not exist,\" and promised to take any privatised prisons back into public ownership \"as soon as contractually possible\", now as home secretary negotiating with yet more big corporations for the privatisation of yet more prisons; 'bluff John' Prescott, the authentic voice of proletarian old Labour, who made it \"crystal clear\" to the 1993 Labour party conference that a Labour government would renationalise the railways if the Tories privatised them, and promised, for instance, that the Birmingham relief road would be built \"only over my dead body\", now, as Huff and Puff John, presiding over the privatised railways during their most disastrous period since before nationalisation fifty years ago - as well as giving the go-ahead for the Birmingham relief road. John P's soul may be mouldering in the grave but his body goes marching on. The list of ministers once critical of the corporations but now slavishly supporting them goes on and on throughout the book: Geoffrey Robinson who, as paymaster general, defended the PFI proposals (and the loss of beds) for Walsgrave Hospital in his constituency, and then, when he lost office, rediscovered his opposition to the plan; Alastair Darling, who in opposition denounced the failure to disclose taxpayers' contributions to PFI projects as \"inexcusable\" but who has not objected to the same failure to disclose PFI figures under his stewardship of the Department of Social Security; Stephen Byers, who as former chair of the Council of LEAs again and again denounced the Tories for the privatisation of education but has stood solidly in support of privatisation and deregulation as trade and industry secretary; and last but by no means least, the genetically modified science minister himself, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who has achieved the all-time record for a serving minister donating private money to the party which made him a minister - in his case at least \u00a34m. The Blair government is now almost entirely servile to its masters in big business. Any minister who for a moment threatened the corporations - David Clark on freedom of information, Nigel Griffiths on consumer influence, Mark Fisher on the arts - has been summarily sacked. Meanwhile, corporation tax and capital gains tax have been cut to ribbons, but income tax has stayed the same. The theoretical regulators of corporate power have become its champions. Naomi Klein's book takes off when she reflects on her college obsessions with gender and race discrimination. \"Our criticism, focused on women and minorities, assumed an atmosphere of plenty . . . class fell off the agenda . . . we were too busy analysing pictures on the wall to notice that the wall had been sold.\" This worried her and her worries led her to the places where 'branded' goods are made, especially to the 'industrial slums' of the Philippines, where half a million people, most of them women, are hoarded into free trade zones and obliged to work in conditions which hark back to the darkest years of industrialisation in the US and Britain. At Cavite in the Philippines she found three vital ingredients required by the contractors to the big US clothing and computer corporations: \"tax breaks, lax regulations and the services of a military willing and able to crush labour unrest\". Here was everything a corporate executive dogged by regulations and recognised trade unions at home could wish for: not just luxury housing, golf courses and an ample supply of cheap domestic servants (they could get most of these back home) but rules against talking and smiling in the factories similar to those contested in Lancashire and Cheshire a hundred years ago. The workers in Cavite are shovelled into stinking dormitories, scratch out a living on starvation wages and are warned every day of the terrible sanctions awaiting anyone who talks to a union organiser. These chapters about exploitation lead Klein on to what she calls the \"bad mood rising\", the discontent which first raged in Seattle in November 1999. The corporations, she argues, \"are stunting human development . . . what good is an open and accountable parliament if economic policy is unchanged?\" Shelley wrote that some atrocity on the part of the wealthy set \"the blood boiling in indignation in my veins\". Ever since I first read that, I've subjected any new political analysis to a BBIV (blood boiling in veins) test. Do these two books pass? The unequivocal answer in both cases is 'yes'. The blood boils all right, both at the corporate exploiters and the politicians who dance to their tune. But as the blood boils, so the mind casts around for a solution. Both authors anticipate this yearning, but they deal with it unsatisfactorily. Both have rejected conventional arenas for political dissension - councils, parliaments etc - and both champion the admirable protests of organisations like Reclaim the Streets. But that seems the limit of their advice. Monbiot concludes that \"corporations are powerful only because we allow them to be\" and will cease to be so when \"people reassert their control\" (when did we ever have this control?). He goes on: \"Our strength lies in our citizenship, in our ability to engage in democratic politics.\" This means, he concludes, \"putting the demo back in democracy\". Klein ends her book in much the same way. \"We will find our way out as citizens on our own. Political solutions deserve another shot.\" These optimistic formulae come at the end of analyses which prove in devastating fashion that the corporate power that rules our lives and our parliaments is backed by the most enormous resources of economic wealth. This power can be shaken and even deflected by vigorous mass protest such as took place at Seattle and at Nice. But if it is to be defeated and transformed, there has to be a power on our side big enough to hurt the corporations where they hurt most, in their pockets; and go on hurting them there. At the end of her book Klein describes a discussion about international codes of business conduct among a gang from the Workers Assistance Centre in Rosario in the Philippines. One worker, Zernon Toledo, pounded the table. \"These documents,\" he bellowed, 'are written by the transnational corporations, so that they will only serve the transnational corporations - haven't you read Marx?\" This seemed to me a fair question, if a little patronising. The indignation which these books ignite needs more food for its flames than vague appeals to citizenship. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

The consumer giveaway, called Megadeals, dwarfs recent price-cut announcements by rivals Asda and Tesco, which have respectively announced \u00a352m and \u00a370m limited period price-cutting campaigns. Somerfield said the Megadeals scheme, which replaces its long-running Price Check promotion, will save shoppers \u00a326m in the first two weeks alone. The move is a gamble for Somerfield because it does not enjoy the buying power of the UK's biggest supermarket Tesco, or Adsa, which is backed by US giant Walmart. \"Megadeals offers more high-value discounts than any other supermarket and ones that will make a real difference to people's shopping bills,\" said Richard Smith, associate marketing director at Somerfield. The initiative also sounds the death-knell for Somerfield's Premier Points loyalty card scheme, although customers will still be able to redeem points at Argos stores until at least next February. Asda, the supermarket most famous for its value brand message, has always eschewed loyalty cards in favour of price cuts.

For while the cost of buying a vehicle remains high, the cost of renting one is falling as companies attempt to shunt each other out of the market. We, the unencumbered, can therefore afford a new people carrier for a family get-together, clock up a thousand miles and return it, soiled, to the rental company for them to deal with. No maintenance. No AA premiums or licence renewal fees. </p> <p>But there is a dark side to this carefreedom. Shaun O'Connell, Susan Greenberg and Peter Doherty are united by the fact that each rented a vehicle from Easyjet's new sister company, Easyrentacar; each returned it in what they insist was immaculate condition and each later discovered their accounts had been debited by up to \u00a3150 because of alleged damage. In Greenberg's case, she was charged for a scratched hubcap, even though the damage had been noted by the rental office before she collected the car. O'Connell didn't know what the extra charge was for until he rang the company's premium rate phone line. \"You can email the company, but they don't reply, so you have to phone them on a 25p-a-minute line and they tell you someone will investigate and get back to you, which they don't.\" </p> <p>Easyrentacar also helped themselves, unannounced, to \u00a3100 from Josh Sims' account, claiming \"minor damage\" to his rental vehicle. When he queried it, he was told the \"damage\" was the removal of the company's advertising stickers on the side of the car. But, Sims protested, there hadn't been any stickers. Easy's defence was that he'd checked the vehicle before hiring it and signed a form confirming its condition. \"But the form says nothing about checking for stickers,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> One consolation for this unhappy quartet is that they're not alone. So many complaints about Easyrentacar have reached the Consumers' Association that they have begun an enquiry. \"Most complaints have been about mysterious charges which are either unexplained or for things like unexpected cleaning,\" a spokeswoman for the Consumers' Association says. \"In all the cases we've looked into, Easyrentacar have held up their hands and refunded the money, sometimes without explanation and sometimes only after several premium rate phone calls.\" A call from Consumer secures an automatic, unexplained refund for O'Connell and Sims; Greenberg and Doherty achieve one by their own efforts. \"We are a no-frills operation,\" says chief executive Andrew Fitzmaurice about the charges. \"We run on a tight budget.\" One problem is many companies neglect to advise customers to be present when the car is inspected, so the customer has no way of proving any alleged damage was not caused by them. After a scolding from the Office of Fair Trading about unfair trading practices, Easy says it now asks customers to witness the inspection and/or sign a form confirming their refusal. </strong> </p> <p> Easyrentacar is by no means the only culprit. Dan Peirson of Nottingham appealed to Consumer after Holiday Autos overcharged him by a day. He'd already paid for an extra day in order to return an hour later than specified; he was told the charge was because he'd collected 20 minutes early. </p> <p><strong> Eventually the company admits a mistake was made. \"Our clients have an hour's leeway either side of the agreed rental period, so we'll be refunding the customer,\" a spokeswoman says.</strong> </p> <p>Steve Rose of London made an internet booking with car hire firm Alamo, but when he arrived at the airport, there was no record of his reservation and he was obliged to fork out again. His laments to Alamo elicited no reply. </p> <p><strong> Again, Consumer coaxes out a confession. \"There was a problem with our computer lines on the date Mr Rose made his reservation, so it was never received,\" a spokeswoman says. He has now been refunded the difference between the online hire fee and the airport price, and given a coupon for two days' free car hire.</strong> </p> <p>Bob Fisher of Dewsbury faced a similar predicament when he tried to collect a vehicle, hired through Autos Abroad, at Rimini airport. After five hours of phoning, he had to rent with another company; he received no response to his request for a refund. Autos Abroad is none other than Hire For Lower whose customer service practices filled Consumer postbags last summer. </p> <p><strong>Hire for Lower sound confused but promise to refund the hire fee and expenses. \"What went wrong?\" we ask a spokeswoman. \"Dunno,\" she answers unreassuringly.</strong> </p> <p>As the car rental industry grows, so must the temptation to cut corners. Easyrentacar's problem is that its upfront hire fees are perilously cheap and it compensates with a rigorous policy of penalty charges. \"When customers hand over their bank details, they are giving companies a blank cheque,\" says a Consumers' Association spokeswoman. But there is some hope for the consumer. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) issues an award-winning code of practice to all members who have to pass rigorous quality controls. The BVRLA says it has encouraged Easyrentacar to apply for membership, but that the company has so far refused. </p> <p>\"We are members,\" Andrew Fitzmaurice says, before consulting with his fleet manager, then backtracking. </p> <p>\"This is the difficulty,\" the BVRLA says. \"Some customers think Easyrentacar is a member, so they feel reassured. Our advice is to check for our logo, then you know you've got somewhere to turn if things go wrong.\" </p> <p>Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

So many complaints about Easyrentacar have reached the Consumers' Association that they have begun an enquiry. \"Most complaints have been about mysterious charges which are either unexplained or for things like unexpected cleaning,\" a spokeswoman for the Consumers' Association says. \"In all the cases we've looked into, Easyrentacar have held up their hands and refunded the money, sometimes without explanation and sometimes only after several premium rate phone calls.\" A call from Consumer secures an automatic, unexplained refund for O'Connell and Sims; Greenberg and Doherty achieve one by their own efforts. \"We are a no-frills operation,\" says chief executive Andrew Fitzmaurice about the charges. \"We run on a tight budget.\" One problem is many companies neglect to advise customers to be present when the car is inspected, so the customer has no way of proving any alleged damage was not caused by them. After a scolding from the Office of Fair Trading about unfair trading practices, Easy says it now asks customers to witness the inspection and/or sign a form confirming their refusal. Easyrentacar is by no means the only culprit. Dan Peirson of Nottingham appealed to Consumer after Holiday Autos overcharged him by a day. He'd already paid for an extra day in order to return an hour later than specified; he was told the charge was because he'd collected 20 minutes early. Eventually the company admits a mistake was made. \"Our clients have an hour's leeway either side of the agreed rental period, so we'll be refunding the customer,\" a spokeswoman says. Steve Rose of London made an internet booking with car hire firm Alamo, but when he arrived at the airport, there was no record of his reservation and he was obliged to fork out again. His laments to Alamo elicited no reply. Again, Consumer coaxes out a confession. \"There was a problem with our computer lines on the date Mr Rose made his reservation, so it was never received,\" a spokeswoman says. He has now been refunded the difference between the online hire fee and the airport price, and given a coupon for two days' free car hire. Bob Fisher of Dewsbury faced a similar predicament when he tried to collect a vehicle, hired through Autos Abroad, at Rimini airport. After five hours of phoning, he had to rent with another company; he received no response to his request for a refund. Autos Abroad is none other than Hire For Lower whose customer service practices filled Consumer postbags last summer. Hire for Lower sound confused but promise to refund the hire fee and expenses. \"What went wrong?\" we ask a spokeswoman. \"Dunno,\" she answers unreassuringly. As the car rental industry grows, so must the temptation to cut corners. Easyrentacar's problem is that its upfront hire fees are perilously cheap and it compensates with a rigorous policy of penalty charges. \"When customers hand over their bank details, they are giving companies a blank cheque,\" says a Consumers' Association spokeswoman. But there is some hope for the consumer. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) issues an award-winning code of practice to all members who have to pass rigorous quality controls. The BVRLA says it has encouraged Easyrentacar to apply for membership, but that the company has so far refused. \"We are members,\" Andrew Fitzmaurice says, before consulting with his fleet manager, then backtracking. \"This is the difficulty,\" the BVRLA says. \"Some customers think Easyrentacar is a member, so they feel reassured. Our advice is to check for our logo, then you know you've got somewhere to turn if things go wrong.\" Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com",

The marketing chief will be responsible for developing the gold branding initiative and adapting it to local needs by working with advertising, branding and PR agencies. It is also anticipated that joint marketing initiatives will be signed with other companies. The new head of corporate communications will generate a new corporate image for the WGC, working closely with chief executive Haruko Fukuda and corporate directors to develop the image and positioning of the WGC around the world. Both positions will report to WCG corporate director Kerr Cruikshanks. \"The perception of what we are as an organisation is vague,\" Mr Cruikshanks said. \"Much of the publicity about us in the past focuses on market reports, data and lobbying about the central bank gold reserves. \"But we are a marketing organisation and spend the bulk of our money on marketing gold.\"",

      "bodyText": "Newly merged media giant Vivendi Universal has said it is on course to meet its ambitious growth targets after posting strong full-year revenues for 2000. The group was formed by the \u00a350bn merger between French company Vivendi, owner of pay-TV channel Canal Plus, and Canadian rival Seagram, which controls Universal Music and Universal Studios. Although today's figures only included 23 days' revenues from the Seagram companies, which formally merged with Vivendi in December, total revenues surged from \u00a318bn in 1999 to \u00a325bn in 2000. \"This new company is off to a fast start and we are very confident that we will meet the very aggressive growth targets we have set for ourselves both at the revenues and EBITDA levels,\" said Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi Universal. The world's second largest media company has forecast growth in EBITDA, or consolidated earnings, of 35% between 2000 and 2002. The company also expects a 10% annual rise in revenue over the same period. Analysts point to the potential of Vivendi's Vizzavi mobile internet service and the huge amount of content the company can deliver over pay-TV and wireless platforms, but they want to see progress on knitting the newly merged company together. \"The sales figures are bang in line with expectations, but we want to see what will be going on in terms of synergies between the different parts of the group. The market is very sceptical about the level of synergies that can be achieved,\" said Commerzbank analyst Marc Loneux. These doubts over the efficiency of the newly formed group have hit Vivendi Universal's share price, which has performed sluggishly since they resumed trading after the merger. Today, shares rose 1% to 4859p. Vivendi Universal will announce its first set of full-year results on March 9 and investors will expect news on the sale of Vivendi's stake in UK satellite TV operator BSkyB. The French company was ordered to sell its 22% stake in the Rupert Murdoch-controlled group by EU regulators and could receive up to \u00a34bn for the holding.",

However, a team of 40 young, Roma journalists at Radio C has begun producing a range of features from issues such as mixed marriages to 'breaking out' of the cycle of living on the dole as the only means of survival. Gypsies have been invited to pitch their own ideas, as well as to bring their own music to add to the station's tiny archive. But Gyoergy points to the vicious circle that, all too often, either prevents such ventures from getting off the ground, or causes them to fold. Advertisers have yet to discover Roma as consumers. Bulgarian journalist Rumyan Russinov has battled for years with similar problems in his attempts to set up Romani broadcasts within the mainstream networks in Sofia. A major part of his goal is to increase the acceptance of Romani journalists in the mainstream media in order that a significant change in the public perception of Roma can take place. He is motivated as much by the wish to counterbalance the mass of denigrating articles about Gypsies full of the old stereotypes in the Bulgarian media as he is to create an open space for Roma within the public sphere. \"Roma have been absent from the media of the countries of central and eastern Europe for decades,\" he said. \"Although in some ways they have always been there, but portrayed as the negative epitome of their societies.\" Zoran Dimov is one of a growing number who believe all that is about to change.

About 650 forged copies of \"Tintin in Thailand\" - a lewd tale of Tintin touring sleazy bars in Bangkok - have been confiscated and at least three people arrested, it emerged yesterday. In Belgium, where the comic strip character with the quiff is something akin to a national hero, the episode has attracted considerable attention, and has been condemned as inbeing poor taste as well as illegal. Tintin's Belgian creator, Herg\u00e9, dreamed up 24 separate adventures for the roving foreign correspondent and his white fox terrier Snowy, but none involved a trip to Thailand and all were considered suitable for children. In the unauthorised Tintin in Thailand album, however, Tintin is seen with his friends Captain Haddock and the absent-minded Professor Calculus drinking beer at a lap dancing bar in Bangkok. He has abandoned his schoolboy vocabulary for a more colourful one inappropriate for young children. In another scene that is likely to anger fans of the comic strip, Tintin is pictured in a gay escort bar called \"Sexy Boy\", where he is propositioned by two male Thai hosts. The album also contains graphic scenes of sodomy involving Snowy and Tintin's Chinese friend Chang. A police unit which spe cialises in investigating counterfeiting mounted an elaborate sting operation in which officers posed as potential buyers and chatted with smugglers in the town of Tournai, near the French border, before revealing their true identities. Two men were arrested, and a third from Antwerp, after they confessed to having produced around 1,000 copies of the unauthorised tome in Thailand for resale in Belgium. Ironically, unscrupulous Thai forgers decided to copy the copy and produced thousands of fake albums which investigators claim are of superior quality to the Belgian version. Tintin first appeared in print in 1929 and the stories of his hair-raising adventures have sold more than 175m copies around the world.",

      "body": "<p>Wimbledon's never-say-die spirit won them the remaining place in the last 16 last night and finally burst the bubble that Terry Venables blew at Boro in mid-December. Five minutes into extra-time Jason Euell rounded off a double exchange with Peter Hawkins by blasting in his 16th goal of the season. </p> <p>Ugo Ehiogu, who had flung himself to stop Euell's first attempt, was sent off moments later for laying out Mark Williams in the jostling at a Boro free-kick. By the time Jonathan Hunt scored another the game was up for Boro, and Wycombe's manager Lawrie Sanchez will have the pleasure on Saturday of entertaining the side for whom he scored the Cup final winner in 1988. </p> <p>This was the first time Venables had been back to Selhurst since, as manager of Crystal Palace, he departed in a puff of melodramatic smoke and familiar suspicion. Now he came trailing clouds of glory, unbeaten in a dozen games as Boro's emergency saviour. He also came without a fair number of first-team regulars, most notably Christian Karembeu suffering an eye injury. Alen Boksic, nursing a groin strain, started on the bench. </p> <p>But Venables still had a solid-looking back three and it is the defensive discipline he has drilled into the side that has turned morale and results round. They needed it from the outset as Wimbledon came at them strongly. Gianluca Festa was forced into a sequence of diving headers to clear crosses. </p> <p>Wimbledon had passed their time since earning the goal-less draw at the Riverside last week sharpening their sights with four goals on Saturday that disposed of Sheffield Wednesday, manager and all. They had also disposed of the man, John Hartson, whose penalty knocked Boro out of the Worthington Cup on Halloween.

      "bodyText": "Wimbledon's never-say-die spirit won them the remaining place in the last 16 last night and finally burst the bubble that Terry Venables blew at Boro in mid-December. Five minutes into extra-time Jason Euell rounded off a double exchange with Peter Hawkins by blasting in his 16th goal of the season. Ugo Ehiogu, who had flung himself to stop Euell's first attempt, was sent off moments later for laying out Mark Williams in the jostling at a Boro free-kick. By the time Jonathan Hunt scored another the game was up for Boro, and Wycombe's manager Lawrie Sanchez will have the pleasure on Saturday of entertaining the side for whom he scored the Cup final winner in 1988. This was the first time Venables had been back to Selhurst since, as manager of Crystal Palace, he departed in a puff of melodramatic smoke and familiar suspicion. Now he came trailing clouds of glory, unbeaten in a dozen games as Boro's emergency saviour. He also came without a fair number of first-team regulars, most notably Christian Karembeu suffering an eye injury. Alen Boksic, nursing a groin strain, started on the bench. But Venables still had a solid-looking back three and it is the defensive discipline he has drilled into the side that has turned morale and results round. They needed it from the outset as Wimbledon came at them strongly. Gianluca Festa was forced into a sequence of diving headers to clear crosses. Wimbledon had passed their time since earning the goal-less draw at the Riverside last week sharpening their sights with four goals on Saturday that disposed of Sheffield Wednesday, manager and all. They had also disposed of the man, John Hartson, whose penalty knocked Boro out of the Worthington Cup on Halloween. But that was when Bryan Robson was in charge. Boro had a couple of bright moments at the start, first when Hamilton Ricard turned near the penalty spot only to meet a firm tackle by Williams as he was poised to shoot. Then Brian Deane dummied past Darren Holloway on the left, making room for a run and cross. But there the brightness died. The pitch quickly became poached and neither side found it conducive to constructive play. In fact, both resigned themselves to the hopelessness of playing decently on it. One-touch foot ball ruled - one touch by Wimbledon, one by Boro. Just past the half-hour there was a flurry of excitement after a stunning block by Ehiogu that saw Damien Francis carried off. Before he was replaced, Curtis Fleming centred for Phil Stamp to head firmly at Kelvin Davis, and in the next minute Gareth Ainsworth provided Mark Schwarzer with his first taste of action. The breakthrough owed most to Paul Ince's determination to win a bouncing ball 25 yards out. He slipped it to Ricard, who found the top corner of the net from 20 yards. The goal not only brought a storming response from Wimbledon, who mustered three corners in succession straight after the interval and saw Gianluca Festa again at the heart of the resistance, it also persuaded Boro that the air was not the only way to progress. It was looking as if their new policy might pay off but with 16 minutes to go and Wimbledon throwing men forward, Ehiogu pulled back Euell, Neil Ardley converted the penalty and the game was level again. \u2022 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Capital Radio and the MXR digital radio consortium, which includes Chrysalis, Capital, Jazz, and Guardian Media Group, have signed up to develop personalised services based on the new technology, which is being billed as TiVo for radio. The US firm behind the technology, Command Audio, is also planning to sign deals with manufacturers to ensure its software is pre-installed in all digital radio receivers. The Command Audio software, which could end up being installed in car radios, Walkmans and digital radio boxes, can store eight hours of content. Capital Radio and commercial radio services group UBC Media have set up a joint venture with Command Audio, called Command Audio UK, to set to up a licensing body and produce on-demand interactive programmes using the new technology. \"Command Audio UK will enable digital broadcasters to deliver a truly new media experience that will clearly differentiate their services from conventional FM radio,\" said Don Bogue, co-founder and chief executive of Command Audio. Command Audio has also signed a deal with MXR, which owns the regional digital radio multiplex licences for the north-east and south Wales/Severn estuary and is bidding for other franchises around the country. MXR has committed to carry Command Audio services on all its regional digital multiplexes. After spending four years developing the software in the US, Command Audio is positioning itself as the added value component of a digital radio box in the UK. The company said it was talking to all radio operators and manufacturers and is on target to launch its first programming service by Christmas. In the US, Command Audio has been running an analogue service for the past 10 months, working with publications including the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Fortune, Time, USA Today and TV shows such as Nightline and The NewsHour to produce audio broadcasts. Digital radio promises to reshape the industry, offering new data services combined with better quality reception.

      "bodyText": "Leading children's charities yesterday united to condemn the leniency of sentences handed down to seven members of a global child pornography ring for distributing more than 750,000 images of child sex abuse. The men, all members of an international ring of 180 paedophiles known as the Wonderland Club, were jailed for between 12 and 30 months. They were spared the three-year maximum jail term the law allows because they pleaded guilty to the charges. Only two of the men were placed on the sex offenders register for life. Seven children's charities, including the NSPCC, Barnardo's and the Children's Society, said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the sentences handed down by Judge Kenneth Macrae at Kingston crown court. He told the men that despite \"pandering to the basest interests of man\" they would have to be given credit for pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute indecent images of children. John Carr, internet consultant with NCH, formerly known as National Children's Homes, said child sex abuse was always a serious issue, but yesterday's sentences sent out a \"contrary message\" to child sex offenders who use the internet. \"The leniency displayed today seems to say that this type of child sex abuse will be tolerated by today's society.\" However, detectives involved in the case said they were satisfied the judge had awarded the longest terms he could under the law. Last month the law was changed to increase the penalty for distributing child pornography to a maximum of 10 years, but it cannot be applied retrospectively. The seven men were arrested on September 2 1998 as part of Operation Cathedral, one of the largest international police operations ever carried out, involving raids across three continents. The investigation began after US customs officers arrested internet paedophiles in 1997 and discovered that they were swapping images of child pornography with Ian Baldock, 31, an Oxford University Press computer consultant from St Leonards, East Sussex. When Sussex police seized Baldock's computer they discovered he belonged to an international club named Wonderland, a global 24-hour internet library containing, in the words of the prosecution lawyer, \"some of the worst images of child abuse ever seen\". The club, which police believe had been operating for at least five years, was protected by powerful gatekeeping and encryption devices and had a rule book providing tips on how to avoid detection by police. Members, who police said regarded themselves as the elite of world paedophiles, had to provide 10,000 new images of child pornography as an entry fee. Officers tracked down the internet service providers being used by the men logging on to the site so they could trace their names and addresses. Police discovered that more than 1,263 children featured in the pictures and videos, many of whom suffered appalling injuries and were seen sobbing uncontrollably as they were sexually violated. So far only 17 have been identified - six in the UK, seven in the US, one in Portugal, one in Chile and one in Argentina. The investigation resulted in 50 convictions worldwide while 22 men are still awaiting trial. Baldock, along with David Hines, an unemployed man from Bognor Regis who used the name \"Matt's Nutts\" in the Wonderland Club, were both jailed for 30 months and placed on the sex offenders register for life. Ahmed Ali, 31, a taxi driver from Tulse Hill in south London who called himself \"Caesar\"; Andrew Barlow, 25, from Milton Keynes who was known as \"Mix\", and Gavin Seagers, 29, a computer consultant and sea cadets youth leader nicknamed \"Spank Daddy\" from Dartford, Kent, were sentenced to two years and placed on the sex offenders register for seven years. Antoni Skinner, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who used the pseudonyms \"Uhura\" and \"Satan\", and Frederick Stephens, 46, a taxi driver from Hayes, west London, nicknamed \"Guess Who\" and \"Me Again\", were jailed for 12 months and placed on the register for seven years. As the seven men stood in the dock the judge told them: \"You used your computer skills to commit crimes decent people find unimaginable. Whether directly or indirectly, you exploited the most vulnerable. Not protected by adults, they were degraded and submitted to acts of great depravity. The photographic record is proof of your perversity.\" He ordered that they should serve at least half their sentences and remain on licence for the remainder. Outside court the officers of the National Crime Squad who led the two-year investigation spoke of their relief. DCI Alex Wood said their work had brought changes in the policing of paedophiles around the world, including the UK's harsher sentencing. \"This has been driven to some extent by the Cathedral inquiry. Paedophiles appearing in court today will receive much more severe sentences because of this legislation. \"A number of countries have introduced legislation as a result of this inquiry and our investigation has been on the worldwide stage.\" Detective Superintendent Peter Spindler, who was in overall charge of the operation, said the convictions were a victory. \"We had to take on the operation to highlight the level of appalling behaviour on the internet. It has contributed to change.\"",

      "byline": "Paul Humphries",

      "body": "<p>Big business and local government are spending millions of pounds each year on fly posting. The difference is, companies are pocketing a massive profit from illegal advertising while councils are left to pick up the bill for keeping the streets clean. </p> <p>There is no city or large town that has not seen streets blighted by the sight of peeling wall posters overlaid with the latest news of a record release or a band on tour. For people in the music business, and other companies wanting to hit the young and hip, fly posting reaches a specific market and gives the brand the instant image of street credibility. </p> <p>But if using the streets to get the message across rings the corporate cash tills, there is also the cost to the local authority and its council tax payers. The Tidy Britain Group estimates that \u00a3340m of public money is spent each year on clearing up litter and a good proportion of this is used to combat fly posting. In a survey of city centres, it found fly posting on 12% of the streets it looked at. </p> <p>Now the government is urging local authorities to clamp down and sweep illegal advertising off the streets. With its sights firmly fixed on an \"urban renaissance\", and with millions of pounds being poured into urban regeneration, it wants local government to act against illegal fly posting, which it believes blights an area and is symptomatic of urban decay. </p> <p>One of the problems is that fly posting is a relatively cheap form of advertising. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) estimates that a company is charged \u00a31.50 for each poster used in its campaign. For a large record company, seeing 50,000 of these posters on the streets promoting a band's album is money well spent. With 250,000 posters going up in a good week, it is also a big earner for the handful of fly posting companies that control the distribution business throughout Britain. No one is going to go without a fight. </p> <p>For years, cash-strapped local authorities have been weighed down by the cost of cleaning up fly posting. Camden council, in north London, estimates it spends \u00a3100,000 a year. It has street cleaning teams out removing posters; covers lamp posts with textured paint which cannot be glued to; builds timber strips on hoardings to make them unusable for fly posting; and spends time advising owners of derelict and empty properties how to keep their sites clean. The council attempts to pursue offenders through the courts and has four cases listed at Highbury magistrates court next month, with 30 in the pipeline. </p> <p>Legal action can be taken through the courts in a number of ways. The main route is section 224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and there are also provisions in the Highways Act of 1980. Authorities can prosecute when people are caught fly posting red-handed, but more often action is taken against the beneficiaries - the people and organisations whose products are advertised. </p> <p>Camden council takes these on, rather than individuals who fly post, but the fines are small. When the authority successfully prosecuted Creation Records over fly posting for the Oasis album Stand By Me, the company received a fine of \u00a31,800 and was ordered to pay costs of \u00a32,000. When the authority tried to prosecute Boo.com in November for stickers allegedly placed on lamp posts, the US-owned company refused to give an address where papers could be served and the council was unable to proceed with its action. </p> <p>Taking the opposite approach, Birmingham city council has been granted a court injunction against a persistent fly posterer, who has been prosecuted eight times in the past six years. Richard Smith appeared before Birmingham crown court a fortnight ago and was banned from fly posting in the city. His court appearances have seen him fined a total of \u00a32,110, with costs of \u00a3901. Legal proceedings are currently being considered against him for further incidents that allegedly took place last year. And if he breaches the injunction, he could face prison. </p> <p>Down the years, Birmingham council has brought more than 250 prosecutions against record companies and fly posterers. But it has been successful in only one case in nine. Fines have totalled \u00a375,000, yet it costs the authority at least \u00a325,000 a year just to remove the posters and stickers. The council thinks it is becoming a victim of its own success in marketing Birmingham as a \"night time economy\", making it a particular target for fly posters advertising records, clubs and events. </p> <p>But it is not only the music business that uses fly posting to reach the punters. Political campaigns of right and left have for centuries used the medium to get across their message. And mainstream media - including, in the past, the Guardian - have started to experiment with unauthorised street promotions. Last year, even Britain's most popular \"soap\" jumped on the bandwagon when a street poster campaign was run to promote a particular episode of Coronation Street. Bills publicising the murder trial of Street villain Jez Quigley went up on walls, roadside junction boxes and bus stops in London and Manchester. They were removed only after Manchester city council threatened legal action. </p> <p>Alan Woods, chief executive of the Tidy Britain Group, says: \"We feel that those businesses that use fly posting to advertise are letting the community down badly.\" His views are echoed by Alan Tallentine, of the Association of Town Centre Management, who argues: \"Fly posting can be not only unsightly, but, in conjunction with high levels of litter and lack of street maintenance, it can be viewed by many people to indicate an area that is not safe to be in, fuelling the fear of crime and - in serious cases - the actuality of crime.\" </p> <p>Yet fly posting may be coming in from the cold. A recent DETR report, The Control of Fly Posting: A Good Practice Guide, says a number of local authorities - Bradford, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield are cited - have struck agreements over what it calls \"formalised sites\". These are sites owned by the local authority where, by agreement, a set number of posters can go up on a regular basis and the fly posterers themselves will keep the site clean and monitor it for \"rogue\" posters. </p> <p>Martin Pagel, deputy leader of Manchester council, is enthusiastic about the idea, which first emerged from discussions in the city five years ago. Under Manchester's version, fly posters have been allowed to mount boards on identified council proper ties. The next step, says Pagel, is to bring private property owners on board and extend the scheme throughout the city. The \"official\" fly poster operators would police the city, monitor the sites and clamp down on \"rogues\" continuing to create litter. </p> <p>\"We are trying to find a way of working with responsible fly posterers and we believe we are succeeding,\" says Pagel. \"We are not against posters going up; it's just where they go that matters. These groups are running businesses and want to be seen to be part of the business community. By working together, we can all achieve something that will be for the good of the community.\" </p> <p><strong>Brushing up on the law</strong></p> <p> Britain is out of step with the rest of Europe in its punitive attitude towards fly posting, according to a solicitor who represents several contractors engaged in the placing of unauthorised advertisements. </p> <p>Peter Dovey, of London-based Peter Dovey &amp; Co, says local authorities need to adopt a more \"enlightened\" approach. Amicable and practical agreements between authorities and the fly poster industry are \"clearly in the best interests\" of both sides. </p> <p>In Dublin, Dovey points out, there have been licensed fly posting sites for more than 10 years. These are managed by a committee made up of local authority officers and representatives of companies which distribute posters. </p> <p>Such schemes have started in some British cities, including Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds and Glasgow. Where they are working, Dovey says, the spirit of realism and compromise shown by the local authorities is being reciprocated by responsible fly poster contractors.</p>",

For people in the music business, and other companies wanting to hit the young and hip, fly posting reaches a specific market and gives the brand the instant image of street credibility. But if using the streets to get the message across rings the corporate cash tills, there is also the cost to the local authority and its council tax payers. The Tidy Britain Group estimates that \u00a3340m of public money is spent each year on clearing up litter and a good proportion of this is used to combat fly posting. In a survey of city centres, it found fly posting on 12% of the streets it looked at. Now the government is urging local authorities to clamp down and sweep illegal advertising off the streets. With its sights firmly fixed on an \"urban renaissance\", and with millions of pounds being poured into urban regeneration, it wants local government to act against illegal fly posting, which it believes blights an area and is symptomatic of urban decay. One of the problems is that fly posting is a relatively cheap form of advertising. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) estimates that a company is charged \u00a31.50 for each poster used in its campaign. For a large record company, seeing 50,000 of these posters on the streets promoting a band's album is money well spent. With 250,000 posters going up in a good week, it is also a big earner for the handful of fly posting companies that control the distribution business throughout Britain. No one is going to go without a fight. For years, cash-strapped local authorities have been weighed down by the cost of cleaning up fly posting. Camden council, in north London, estimates it spends \u00a3100,000 a year. It has street cleaning teams out removing posters; covers lamp posts with textured paint which cannot be glued to; builds timber strips on hoardings to make them unusable for fly posting; and spends time advising owners of derelict and empty properties how to keep their sites clean. The council attempts to pursue offenders through the courts and has four cases listed at Highbury magistrates court next month, with 30 in the pipeline. Legal action can be taken through the courts in a number of ways. The main route is section 224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and there are also provisions in the Highways Act of 1980. Authorities can prosecute when people are caught fly posting red-handed, but more often action is taken against the beneficiaries - the people and organisations whose products are advertised. Camden council takes these on, rather than individuals who fly post, but the fines are small. When the authority successfully prosecuted Creation Records over fly posting for the Oasis album Stand By Me, the company received a fine of \u00a31,800 and was ordered to pay costs of \u00a32,000. When the authority tried to prosecute Boo.com in November for stickers allegedly placed on lamp posts, the US-owned company refused to give an address where papers could be served and the council was unable to proceed with its action. Taking the opposite approach, Birmingham city council has been granted a court injunction against a persistent fly posterer, who has been prosecuted eight times in the past six years. Richard Smith appeared before Birmingham crown court a fortnight ago and was banned from fly posting in the city. His court appearances have seen him fined a total of \u00a32,110, with costs of \u00a3901. Legal proceedings are currently being considered against him for further incidents that allegedly took place last year. And if he breaches the injunction, he could face prison. Down the years, Birmingham council has brought more than 250 prosecutions against record companies and fly posterers. But it has been successful in only one case in nine. Fines have totalled \u00a375,000, yet it costs the authority at least \u00a325,000 a year just to remove the posters and stickers. The council thinks it is becoming a victim of its own success in marketing Birmingham as a \"night time economy\", making it a particular target for fly posters advertising records, clubs and events. But it is not only the music business that uses fly posting to reach the punters. Political campaigns of right and left have for centuries used the medium to get across their message. And mainstream media - including, in the past, the Guardian - have started to experiment with unauthorised street promotions. Last year, even Britain's most popular \"soap\" jumped on the bandwagon when a street poster campaign was run to promote a particular episode of Coronation Street. Bills publicising the murder trial of Street villain Jez Quigley went up on walls, roadside junction boxes and bus stops in London and Manchester. They were removed only after Manchester city council threatened legal action. Alan Woods, chief executive of the Tidy Britain Group, says: \"We feel that those businesses that use fly posting to advertise are letting the community down badly.\" His views are echoed by Alan Tallentine, of the Association of Town Centre Management, who argues: \"Fly posting can be not only unsightly, but, in conjunction with high levels of litter and lack of street maintenance, it can be viewed by many people to indicate an area that is not safe to be in, fuelling the fear of crime and - in serious cases - the actuality of crime.\" Yet fly posting may be coming in from the cold. A recent DETR report, The Control of Fly Posting: A Good Practice Guide, says a number of local authorities - Bradford, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield are cited - have struck agreements over what it calls \"formalised sites\". These are sites owned by the local authority where, by agreement, a set number of posters can go up on a regular basis and the fly posterers themselves will keep the site clean and monitor it for \"rogue\" posters. Martin Pagel, deputy leader of Manchester council, is enthusiastic about the idea, which first emerged from discussions in the city five years ago. Under Manchester's version, fly posters have been allowed to mount boards on identified council proper ties. The next step, says Pagel, is to bring private property owners on board and extend the scheme throughout the city. The \"official\" fly poster operators would police the city, monitor the sites and clamp down on \"rogues\" continuing to create litter. \"We are trying to find a way of working with responsible fly posterers and we believe we are succeeding,\" says Pagel. \"We are not against posters going up; it's just where they go that matters. These groups are running businesses and want to be seen to be part of the business community. By working together, we can all achieve something that will be for the good of the community.\" Brushing up on the law Britain is out of step with the rest of Europe in its punitive attitude towards fly posting, according to a solicitor who represents several contractors engaged in the placing of unauthorised advertisements. Peter Dovey, of London-based Peter Dovey &amp; Co, says local authorities need to adopt a more \"enlightened\" approach. Amicable and practical agreements between authorities and the fly poster industry are \"clearly in the best interests\" of both sides. In Dublin, Dovey points out, there have been licensed fly posting sites for more than 10 years. These are managed by a committee made up of local authority officers and representatives of companies which distribute posters. Such schemes have started in some British cities, including Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds and Glasgow. Where they are working, Dovey says, the spirit of realism and compromise shown by the local authorities is being reciprocated by responsible fly poster contractors.",

Research published in the British Medical Journal last month confirmed that prevocational training - from sheltered workshops to confidence- building programmes - rarely leads to employment. Peter Huxley, professor of social work at the Institute of Psychiatry, and colleagues found supported employment schemes, which place service users in work without lengthy preparation, were far more likely to lead to competitive jobs. After 12 months, 34% of people with severe mental health problems in such schemes were in work - compared with 12% of those in prevocational training. Several NHS trusts are employing service users in competitive jobs. south-west London and St George's mental health trust established a supported employment programme in 1995, which to date has helped 43 service users into existing posts within the trust.

The scheme includes a new specialist treatment project at the high security Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, which will develop a range of new therapeutic treatments, and a new unit at Frankland prison, Co. Durham, which will provide 100 assessment and treatment places. A 70-place unit is also being built at the high security Rampton hospital, with opening scheduled next year. A further 70 places are to be made available within the NHS. The announcement represents the second phase of the government's programme to deal with this group. The first pilot schemes, unveiled last September and located at Whitemoor and Rampton, are designed to research a rigorous assessment tool to help identify those to be included. Straw says \u00a3126m is being made available over the next three years.",

      "body": "<p>The most influential books are always those that are not read. So says Michael Young, and he should know. His classic The Rise of the Meritocracy, published in 1958, endowed the language with a word which has been misinterpreted ever since. As he pointed out recently, hardly anyone seems to realise that the book is a satire, and that the society it envisaged is a doomed dystopia.</p> <p>\"I wanted to show how overweening a meritocracy could be,\" Young explained, \"and indeed the people generally who thought they belonged to it, including the author to whom the book was attributed.\" Silly old sausage: didn't he realise that irony and satire will always be taken literally by at least half the people who read it, and by a far higher percentage of those blithering bratwursts who haven't read it at all but base their inferences on the title alone?</p> <p>One such, I suspect, is our own prime minister. But this hasn't inhibited him from holding forth on the subject: \"We are light years from being a true meritocracy\" (July 1995); \"I want a society based on meritocracy\" (April 1997); \"The Britain of the elite is over. The new Britain is a meritocracy\"; (October 1997); \"The old establishment is being replaced by a new, larger, more meritocratic middle class\" (January 1999);\"The meritocracy is built on the potential of the many, not the few\" (October 1999); \"The meritocratic society is the only one that can exploit its economic potential to the full for all its people\" (June 2000).</p> <p>Despite the obvious and comical contradictions - how could something that was \"light years away\" in 1995 have arrived a mere two years later? - Blair is at least consistent in never using the M-word pejoratively. Last week, however, a small caveat appeared for the first time. \"In the past, the idea of meritocracy has been attacked,\" he declared in his Enfield speech. \"But creating a society that is meritocratic is not wrong, it is just insufficient.\" But the qualification seems to be largely rhetorical: even if meritocracy is not enough, according to Blair, it is still \"an indispensable part of building a decent and prosperous society\" by \"breaking down the barriers to success\".</p> <p>To Tony Blair, meritocracy is synonymous with equality of opportunity - and who could object to that? Well, Michael Young, to name but one. \"I thought equality of opportunity, the way it was thought of and the way it is still thought of, was a baneful thing,\" he said a few years ago, in a radio interview marking the 40th anniversary of The Rise of the Meritocracy. \"I saw the meritocracy as becoming less and less concerned with the main body of people, establishing a sort of culture of their own, an elite culture with a good deal of arrogance in it. These things have largely happened . . .\"</p> <p>Or, as he put it in his book, equality of opportunity tends to mean, in practice, equality of opportunity to be unequal. Lo and behold, the prime minister used the phrase again on Monday when presenting his plan to reintroduce a two-tier system of secondary schools. Far from \"breaking down the barriers to success\", meritocracy erects daunting new hurdles. Anyone who doubts this should read The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy, in which Nicholas Lemann reveals how the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was used to select the ruling class of post-war America.</p> <p>In the days of aristocratic dominance, there were at least some in the upper class who felt insecure in their hereditary power, and many in the lower classes who refused to accept the legitimacy of their rule. But when merit alone reigns, and is almost universally accepted as the fairest arbiter, those in the elite entertain no doubts at all: they are there because they bloody well deserve to be. Those who lose out are condemned to helpless despair, stigmatised by their own alleged inadequacy.</p> <p>And the new order soon becomes as stratified as the old. As TS Eliot, who was not exactly a loony lefty, wrote in his Notes Towards the Definition of Culture: \"An elite, if it is a governing elite, so far as the natural impulse to pass on to one's offspring both power and prestige is not artificially checked, will tend to establish itself as a class.\" One obvious way of introducing an \"artificial check\" would be to challenge the influence of the public schools, but this Labour government - like all its predecessors - has no intention of doing so.</p> <p>In Young's book, the British meritocracy eventually provokes an uprising of \"populist\" democrats opposed to a system which evaluates people only according to their intelligence, education, occupation and power, with little account given to qualities such as imagination, courage or generosity.

      "bodyText": "The most influential books are always those that are not read. So says Michael Young, and he should know. His classic The Rise of the Meritocracy, published in 1958, endowed the language with a word which has been misinterpreted ever since. As he pointed out recently, hardly anyone seems to realise that the book is a satire, and that the society it envisaged is a doomed dystopia. \"I wanted to show how overweening a meritocracy could be,\" Young explained, \"and indeed the people generally who thought they belonged to it, including the author to whom the book was attributed.\" Silly old sausage: didn't he realise that irony and satire will always be taken literally by at least half the people who read it, and by a far higher percentage of those blithering bratwursts who haven't read it at all but base their inferences on the title alone? One such, I suspect, is our own prime minister. But this hasn't inhibited him from holding forth on the subject: \"We are light years from being a true meritocracy\" (July 1995); \"I want a society based on meritocracy\" (April 1997); \"The Britain of the elite is over. The new Britain is a meritocracy\"; (October 1997); \"The old establishment is being replaced by a new, larger, more meritocratic middle class\" (January 1999);\"The meritocracy is built on the potential of the many, not the few\" (October 1999); \"The meritocratic society is the only one that can exploit its economic potential to the full for all its people\" (June 2000). Despite the obvious and comical contradictions - how could something that was \"light years away\" in 1995 have arrived a mere two years later? - Blair is at least consistent in never using the M-word pejoratively. Last week, however, a small caveat appeared for the first time. \"In the past, the idea of meritocracy has been attacked,\" he declared in his Enfield speech. \"But creating a society that is meritocratic is not wrong, it is just insufficient.\" But the qualification seems to be largely rhetorical: even if meritocracy is not enough, according to Blair, it is still \"an indispensable part of building a decent and prosperous society\" by \"breaking down the barriers to success\". To Tony Blair, meritocracy is synonymous with equality of opportunity - and who could object to that? Well, Michael Young, to name but one. \"I thought equality of opportunity, the way it was thought of and the way it is still thought of, was a baneful thing,\" he said a few years ago, in a radio interview marking the 40th anniversary of The Rise of the Meritocracy. \"I saw the meritocracy as becoming less and less concerned with the main body of people, establishing a sort of culture of their own, an elite culture with a good deal of arrogance in it. These things have largely happened . . .\" Or, as he put it in his book, equality of opportunity tends to mean, in practice, equality of opportunity to be unequal. Lo and behold, the prime minister used the phrase again on Monday when presenting his plan to reintroduce a two-tier system of secondary schools. Far from \"breaking down the barriers to success\", meritocracy erects daunting new hurdles. Anyone who doubts this should read The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy, in which Nicholas Lemann reveals how the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was used to select the ruling class of post-war America. In the days of aristocratic dominance, there were at least some in the upper class who felt insecure in their hereditary power, and many in the lower classes who refused to accept the legitimacy of their rule. But when merit alone reigns, and is almost universally accepted as the fairest arbiter, those in the elite entertain no doubts at all: they are there because they bloody well deserve to be. Those who lose out are condemned to helpless despair, stigmatised by their own alleged inadequacy. And the new order soon becomes as stratified as the old. As TS Eliot, who was not exactly a loony lefty, wrote in his Notes Towards the Definition of Culture: \"An elite, if it is a governing elite, so far as the natural impulse to pass on to one's offspring both power and prestige is not artificially checked, will tend to establish itself as a class.\" One obvious way of introducing an \"artificial check\" would be to challenge the influence of the public schools, but this Labour government - like all its predecessors - has no intention of doing so. In Young's book, the British meritocracy eventually provokes an uprising of \"populist\" democrats opposed to a system which evaluates people only according to their intelligence, education, occupation and power, with little account given to qualities such as imagination, courage or generosity. Could there be a similar backlash against Blair's New Jerusalem? Certainly not: Young's book was a satirical fantasy, as the author admits. It imagined a meritocratic society of huge and widening inequalities, with a technocratic superclass at the top and a sullen underclass below. It suggested that the new British elite would be not only unrepresentative but also more interested in consolidating its own power than in improving the common weal. It also predicted that by the 21st century the Labour party would have rebranded itself with a more \"modern\" name, and would set about abolishing comprehensive education. (\"To us the failure of comprehensive schools does not seem to require explanation. We can hardly conceive of a society built upon consideration for the individual regardless of his merit, regardless of the needs of society as a whole.\") Even more absurdly, it envisaged a \"progressive\" government which stripped hereditary peers of their parliamentary privileges - only to replace them with life peers chosen from among the most eminent members of the new privileged class. \"Skipping all the intermediate stages of democracy (as some countries have jumped straight from railways to rockets), an instrument of the aristocracy was by one brilliant stroke made an instrument of the meritocracy.\" Pure fiction, thank God. Look who's playing at star wars At his press conference with Tony Blair last week, Jacques Chirac, the president of France, described the national missile defence system (NMD) as an \"incitement to proliferation\". Ever since men began waging war, he said, there has been a race between the sword and the shield.

      "body": "<p>Last Tuesday started out much like any other day as I slotted the odd domestic chore in alongside the ongoing requirements of work. At 10am I loaded the washing machine with a white wash. Since it wasn't quite full, I went upstairs to collect a few more things, made a couple of phone calls and then went back downstairs to switch it on. An hour and a half later I unloaded the machine, wondering as I did so how my daughter's black fleece had managed to end up in there.</p> <p>But it wasn't my daughter's fleece. I realised almost immediately that somehow our beloved six-month-old black cat, Mossy, had crawled into the machine for a bit of warmth and peace. I'd clocked her prowling round the kitchen that morning, but then forgotten to check.</p> <p>I don't think anything has upset me quite so much. It was such a shock to discover this creature, whom I adored and who trusted me so implicitly, lying there in among the wet laundry, a heavy, limp, saturated lump.</p> <p>Unable to delve any further into the washing, I fled upstairs to make a hysterical phone call to my husband, who couldn't believe what I was telling him. Ten minutes later, when Dan came home, I heard him from the upstairs bedroom take Mossy in his arms and sob. Later he dug a hole in the garden ready to bury her that evening.</p> <p>For hours I stayed upstairs, agonising over what to tell the children. They had always seen my habitual vagueness and clumsiness as a health and safety hazard, and I had proved them right.</p> <p>The irony was that Dan and I had been totally opposed to getting this cat and had only succumbed after a year and a half of relentless pestering from our eight-year-old daughter. In the end, we had adored her as much as the children had. Having always been indifferent to cats, I found ours endlessly fascinating, marvelling at how she would rugby-tackle Dan as he walked down the corridor or lie on my knee for hours on end while I tapped away at my keyboard.</p> <p>My first instinct was to lie to the children about what had happened, not to save my own skin, but because the way she had died was just too gruesome. My mother-in-law was all for pretending that Mossy had simply disappeared. But how could we go through with the pretence of putting up posters or watch the children anxiously guarding the catflap in anticipation that she might suddenly dart through?</p> <p>By 2pm, knowing they would soon be home from school, I rang the Child Bereavement Trust in desperation, presuming that the same advice must apply to pets as to people. A soft-voiced counsellor advised me that children need to hear the truth from their parents. \"They would never forgive you if one day they found out from someone else how their cat had died,\" she said.</p> <p>I told everyone who called that day about Mossy - even the woman from BT - because in my incoherence it was all I could think and talk about. I was amazed at how many similar ghastly tales I heard: a friend's brother, who had come down from a ladder and crushed his cat; my cousin, who had rolled over on his hamster; and three other people who had accidentally run over their pets. I even heard of a woman who had unknowingly shut her cat in the washing machine and switched it on. Except she was blind.</p> <p>I left it to my husband to break the news to our three children - Phoebe, 11, Flora, eight, and Reuben, three. Of course, they were utterly distraught; yet after that first evening of shock, disbelief and tears, they seemed to rally. Reuben has barely noticed Mossy's absence; Flora, after 24 hours of acute misery, has taken comfort in the thought of getting another cat, particularly as I have now said that this one can have kittens (as she pointed out, \"you owe us a life\"). Only Phoebe is still sad, her emotions intensified by the fact that she won't tell her friends about the incident. When I asked why, she said: \"Because if they asked how it happened, I couldn't bear to tell them.\"<br><br>Recrimination and blame have, of course, come my way, though in a surprisingly matter-of-fact manner. On that first day, seeing how distraught I was, Phoebe limited herself to one accusation: \"Why are you so careless?\" Since then there has been the occasional \"cat killer\", \"mass murderer\"-type dig. And yesterday, when I apologised for mistakenly turning off the lights in Phoebe's room while she was still in there working, I heard her say through gritted teeth: \"You make too many mistakes.\"</p> <p>Most people I have told have been both horrified and sympathetic. Only one woman came up to me in the playground and said, \"I know it's very sad, but . . .\" and proceeded to burst out laughing. She soon stopped, realising that while the cartoon image of the pet in the washing machine may be hilarious to some - a macabre materialisation of an urban myth - for me it could never be a laughing matter. Had Mossy been human - and she had seemed to be sometimes - I would have been charged with manslaughter. And lately, when it comes to working out the exact events leading up to my criminal act, I seem to be suffering from a kind of accused's amnesia. Sometimes I think Iactually saw Mossy get into the machine.</p> <p>But perhaps, as some people say, pets are here to teach us something. Mossy certainly taught our family about love and death. And, as I went round the house yesterday removing every matchbox in sight to combat my three-year-old's increasing pyromaniac tendencies, I thought that perhaps, after all, there was a purpose to our cat's untimely death.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The over-60s will be able to escape the poverty of old age under anti-discrimination laws which will make it illegal to ban them from working as long as they like. The government will today announce a working group to iron out the details of the law which will ban compulsorary retirement at any age by 2006. Business leaders and campaign groups for the elderly will be consulted. Ministers are determined to eradicate a set retirement age - currently 60 for women and 65 for men - while ensuring the law is workable. \"We want to ensure we get it right,\" a Department of Employment spokesman said. The measure, to be signalled by the junior employment minister, Margaret Hodge, in a Commons committee hearing today, is being brought in to comply with a European Union directive agreed last year. The directive seeks to outlaw discrimination against people at work on the grounds of religion, age, disability or sexual orientation in the next six years. A third of men and women aged 50-65 - 2.8m people - are no longer employed. Last year, a cabinet office report recommended unemployed men over 60 should lose their benefits unless they proved they were looking for jobs. The cost of economic \"inactivity\" among the over-50s is estimated to be at least \u00a326bn. Age Concern, which welcomed the measure, predicted many people would wish to defer their state pensions and continue working. \"Most people are still fairly active into their 70s and we know from anecdoctal evidence that many want to work,\" said spokesman Rhian Beynon. \"For some, it's because they want the recognition and stimulation of working but for some it's because they can't afford to retire on the basic state pension.\" Just 60% of workers have an occupational pension on top of the \u00a367.50 state pension, and of these half gain no more than an extra \u00a355 a week. Patrick Gratton, of Help the Aged, added: \"This is good for employers, the economy and individuals and it does not present a problem for employers as two thirds of men do not work right up until the retirement age anyway.\" The Tories said flexible retirement chimed with the responsible society they wished to create. The Liberal Democrats' social security spokesman, Steve Webb, said: \"There is a real waste of talent when people are forced to retire when they do not want to.

The world's largest telecom equipment maker is on the verge of losing out on contracts worth $1.8bn to build a mobile phone network in China. Newspaper reports in China yesterday said that Qualcomm would win the contract to build the next generation wireless network for China Unicom and Nortel would build a small portion of the network for $32m. Lucent, once the favoured player in the market, won no part of the project. Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service both cut Lucent's credit rating on Monday, bringing its shares down nearly 12% to $13, an 80% fall from its 52-week high. The agencies attributed the rate cut, which puts Lucent \"a notch above junk-bond status\", to the $1bn loss the company reported in the first fiscal quarter of 2001. Lucent has repeatedly missed analysts' earnings projections over the past year, and its accounting practices are the subject of an investigation by the US securities exchange commission.

      "body": "<p>British Biotech, the fallen angel of the drug development industry, has sounded the death knell for marimastat, the onetime cure for cancer that was over-hyped to such a degree that it triggered one of the most acrimonious boardroom rows of the 1990s. </p> <p>After nearly a decade of research, the company yesterday admitted that marimastat was a flop, after failure in its sixth successive clinical trial - this time, on patients with small-cell lung cancer. Chief executive Elliot Goldstein said: \"It hasn't worked. We're moving on.\" </p> <p>Marimastat had already failed to help patients with pancreatic, gastric, ovarian and brain cancer. British Biotech's shares, which touched 300p at the height of enthusiasm about marimastat in 1996, fell 1p yesterday to 26p. </p> <p>To the company's executives, the news was more of a relief than a disappointment. Finance director Tony Weir said he had been keen to leave marimastat behind for months: \"Any negative result is disappointing, but as far as British Biotech's concerned, marimastat has dominated the way people have looked at us, sometimes inappropriately.\" </p> <p>The debacle fulfilled predictions made three years ago by former clinical research chief Andrew Millar, who became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among whistle-blowers when he was sacked by British Biotech for expressing concerns to shareholders. </p> <p>The dissident scientist's disclosures led to the departure of the company's entire board, a parliamentary inquiry, regulatory investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and a plunge in share prices throughout the biotech industry. </p> <p>Marimastat's origins lie in work carried out by scientists in the early days of British Biotech, at a former carpet warehouse on the outskirts of Oxford in the late 1980s. Using computer models, they were designing drugs which would attack cancer in a new way. </p> <p>British Biotech was trying to break out of the mould of cancer care - traditional drugs irradiated fast-dividing tumour cells, preventing the disease's spread but causing unpleasant side effects. The new company, founded by former Searle pharmaceuticals executive Keith McCullagh, wanted to target matrix metalloproteases - enzymes in the body which enable tumour cells to get into the blood and move around. </p> <p>The idea was just the beginning of a dream for Dr McCullagh - he wanted to create a multinational drugs corporation rivalling Glaxo Wellcome. British Biotech's team came up with hundreds of different chemical compounds which would inhibit these metalloproteases. Among the most promising was marimastat, which did well enough in early trials to encourage investors to stump up for a \u00a3151m stockmarket flotation in 1992. </p> <p>As trials progressed, British Biotech's market value soared. Former development director Peter Lewis described the results of phase two studies as \"about the best possible at this stage in development\". </p> <p>By 1996, British Biotech was worth more than \u00a32bn and teetering on the edge of the FTSE-100 index. The firm moved into a sparkling new building. But less than a year later, problems began to emerge. </p> <p>Andrew Millar, then head of clinical research, recalls that he first became concerned when a doctor involved with the most exacting round of trials, phase three studies, phoned him to highlight possible side effects among a few patients. </p> <p>Worried that Dr McCullagh could be over-hyping an unsafe drug, Dr Millar took a controversial decision to \"unblind\" the studies. This involved examining data to compare those on a placebo against those taking marimastat. It was a breach of the usual convention, which is to wait until trials have been completed. </p> <p>He discovered that although side effects were modest, the drug was not working - just as many people were dying on marimastat as on placebo. Neither was another key product, pancreatitis treatment Zacutex. </p> <p>Dr Millar maintains that he was anxious that investors were being misled about the drug's prospects. Having been bawled out by Dr McCullagh for looking at confidential data, he revealed his concerns to an analyst, Jane Henderson of Goldman Sachs, and to a shareholder, Neil Woodford of fund manager Perpetual. </p> <p>He spelled out his fears at a secret lunch in an Oxfordshire pub in early 1998. Along with Mr Woodford, he hatched a plan to oust Dr McCullagh, and instal himself as chief operating officer of British Biotech. </p> <p>This plan came unstuck when the pair tried to recruit the support of the company's broker, Kleinwort Benson. The merchant bank tipped off Dr McCullagh. </p> <p>Dr Millar was suspended by British Biotech. In a dramatic fightback, he revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating allegedly over-optimistic press releases from British Biotech about marimastat, and the stock exchange was looking into large share sales by directors at a time when they were aware that the drug's progress was equivocal. </p> <p>Recruiting the support of the British Medical Association, he won an out-of-court settlement for wrongful dismissal, and the board of British Biotech resigned en masse. </p> <p>Dr Millar still believes marimastat had a chance of working, had the company adjusted trials to concentrate on delivering large doses to patients with small tumours. Opinions are still divided on whether Dr Millar's actions were appropriate in looking early at the data from clinical trials. </p> <p>Even under new management, British Biotech has struggled to rebuild its reputation. The company has six drugs in the early stages of clinical trials, including treatments for leukaemia, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. As of last October, British Biotech had \u00a361m of cash in the bank, and many believe the firm is likely to be swallowed in a merger or takeover. </p> <p>Finance director Tony Weir said: \"We're very open to corporate transactions in any form - whether through partnership, joint ventures, acquisitions or mergers.\" </p> <p>There are few winners from the marimastat story - Dr Millar now runs a start-up firm called Oxford Gene Technology. </p> <p>Dr McCullagh's dream of creating the next Glaxo Wellcome is over, and Kleinwort Benson has lost its place as one of the leading advisers to biotechnology companies.

      "bodyText": "British Biotech, the fallen angel of the drug development industry, has sounded the death knell for marimastat, the onetime cure for cancer that was over-hyped to such a degree that it triggered one of the most acrimonious boardroom rows of the 1990s. After nearly a decade of research, the company yesterday admitted that marimastat was a flop, after failure in its sixth successive clinical trial - this time, on patients with small-cell lung cancer. Chief executive Elliot Goldstein said: \"It hasn't worked. We're moving on.\" Marimastat had already failed to help patients with pancreatic, gastric, ovarian and brain cancer. British Biotech's shares, which touched 300p at the height of enthusiasm about marimastat in 1996, fell 1p yesterday to 26p. To the company's executives, the news was more of a relief than a disappointment. Finance director Tony Weir said he had been keen to leave marimastat behind for months: \"Any negative result is disappointing, but as far as British Biotech's concerned, marimastat has dominated the way people have looked at us, sometimes inappropriately.\" The debacle fulfilled predictions made three years ago by former clinical research chief Andrew Millar, who became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among whistle-blowers when he was sacked by British Biotech for expressing concerns to shareholders. The dissident scientist's disclosures led to the departure of the company's entire board, a parliamentary inquiry, regulatory investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and a plunge in share prices throughout the biotech industry. Marimastat's origins lie in work carried out by scientists in the early days of British Biotech, at a former carpet warehouse on the outskirts of Oxford in the late 1980s. Using computer models, they were designing drugs which would attack cancer in a new way. British Biotech was trying to break out of the mould of cancer care - traditional drugs irradiated fast-dividing tumour cells, preventing the disease's spread but causing unpleasant side effects. The new company, founded by former Searle pharmaceuticals executive Keith McCullagh, wanted to target matrix metalloproteases - enzymes in the body which enable tumour cells to get into the blood and move around. The idea was just the beginning of a dream for Dr McCullagh - he wanted to create a multinational drugs corporation rivalling Glaxo Wellcome. British Biotech's team came up with hundreds of different chemical compounds which would inhibit these metalloproteases. Among the most promising was marimastat, which did well enough in early trials to encourage investors to stump up for a \u00a3151m stockmarket flotation in 1992. As trials progressed, British Biotech's market value soared. Former development director Peter Lewis described the results of phase two studies as \"about the best possible at this stage in development\". By 1996, British Biotech was worth more than \u00a32bn and teetering on the edge of the FTSE-100 index. The firm moved into a sparkling new building. But less than a year later, problems began to emerge. Andrew Millar, then head of clinical research, recalls that he first became concerned when a doctor involved with the most exacting round of trials, phase three studies, phoned him to highlight possible side effects among a few patients. Worried that Dr McCullagh could be over-hyping an unsafe drug, Dr Millar took a controversial decision to \"unblind\" the studies. This involved examining data to compare those on a placebo against those taking marimastat. It was a breach of the usual convention, which is to wait until trials have been completed. He discovered that although side effects were modest, the drug was not working - just as many people were dying on marimastat as on placebo. Neither was another key product, pancreatitis treatment Zacutex. Dr Millar maintains that he was anxious that investors were being misled about the drug's prospects. Having been bawled out by Dr McCullagh for looking at confidential data, he revealed his concerns to an analyst, Jane Henderson of Goldman Sachs, and to a shareholder, Neil Woodford of fund manager Perpetual. He spelled out his fears at a secret lunch in an Oxfordshire pub in early 1998. Along with Mr Woodford, he hatched a plan to oust Dr McCullagh, and instal himself as chief operating officer of British Biotech. This plan came unstuck when the pair tried to recruit the support of the company's broker, Kleinwort Benson. The merchant bank tipped off Dr McCullagh. Dr Millar was suspended by British Biotech. In a dramatic fightback, he revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating allegedly over-optimistic press releases from British Biotech about marimastat, and the stock exchange was looking into large share sales by directors at a time when they were aware that the drug's progress was equivocal. Recruiting the support of the British Medical Association, he won an out-of-court settlement for wrongful dismissal, and the board of British Biotech resigned en masse. Dr Millar still believes marimastat had a chance of working, had the company adjusted trials to concentrate on delivering large doses to patients with small tumours. Opinions are still divided on whether Dr Millar's actions were appropriate in looking early at the data from clinical trials. Even under new management, British Biotech has struggled to rebuild its reputation. The company has six drugs in the early stages of clinical trials, including treatments for leukaemia, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. As of last October, British Biotech had \u00a361m of cash in the bank, and many believe the firm is likely to be swallowed in a merger or takeover. Finance director Tony Weir said: \"We're very open to corporate transactions in any form - whether through partnership, joint ventures, acquisitions or mergers.\" There are few winners from the marimastat story - Dr Millar now runs a start-up firm called Oxford Gene Technology. Dr McCullagh's dream of creating the next Glaxo Wellcome is over, and Kleinwort Benson has lost its place as one of the leading advisers to biotechnology companies. Worst of all, cancer sufferers had their hopes raised, then dashed. British Biotech's current boss, Elliot Goldstein, hates talking about marimastat. However, he conceeds that there are lessons to be learned for all drug development firms - British Biotech's mistake, he says, was to put all its eggs in one basket. 1986 Former Searle drugs executive Keith McCullagh founds British Biotech July, 1992 It is the first biotech company to float in London, valued at \u00a3152m May, 1996 Marimastat achieves \"best possible\" phase two clinical trial results Late 1997 Research chief Andrew Millar examines confidential trial data, amid concerns about side effects April 1998 Millar sacked for \"bitching\" to outsiders May 1998 McCullagh resigns as chief executive February 1999 Marimastat is no better than existing medicines in trials on pancreatic cancer February 2001 Marimastat is abandoned Other disasters \u0095 Scotia Holdings went into administration last month after rejection of its Foscan treatment for head and neck cancer.

Today union leaders will present a rescue package to the company to stop the cuts, which Corus is planning in several areas, including Wales and the north-east. Online cars war hits Brussels Britain's two largest internet car retailers, Virgin Cars and Direct Line's Jamjar.com, took their fight for lower car prices to Brussels yesterday. They told the European commission that the car industry's \"block exemption\" from normal EU competition rules means British consumers pay too much for cars and have less choice. Rules governing car sales are due to expire in September 2002 and the EC is in the process of deciding whether to scrap or modify them. They take no account of online or supermarket sales, and price differentials as high as 65% persist within the EU. Pensioners fight Grid move Power industry pensioners yesterday sought to persuade the House of Lords that an attempt by privatised electricity companies to plunder billions of pounds of pension funds should be ruled illegal. The pensioners believe the companies wrongly used \u00a3350m of pension fund surpluses from the \u00a318bn electricity supply pension scheme to pay off redundant workers at the time of privatisation. They argue that the funds should have been used to boost payments to pensioners and their widows on low incomes. National Grid is urging law lords to overturn a court of appeal ruling that the company acted unlawfully in taking \u00a346.3m in surpluses from the industry pension scheme in 1992. The hearing continues Medical House starts trials Medical House, the surgical products supplier, is to start trials of a new diagnostic device which identifies, by analysing the breath, a bacteria believed to cause stomach ulcers. Sources close to the company said tests on the hyperlyser will take place at Bristol's University of the West of England. Shares in the company, which is listed on the AIM, stood at 30p last night, below its 65p year high.",

      "bodyText": "President George Bush is rapidly putting his own stamp on the US presidency, but his recent lower-level appointments show that the substance of the new team in Washington is overwhelmingly from of the era of his father and Ronald Reagan. The return of the Reaganites is particularly evident in the areas of foreign and defence policy, where Mr Bush has just appointed Richard Armitage deputy secretary of state under Colin Powell. Mr Armitage is a Pentagon veteran of the Reagan and Bush Sr era, during which he played a key role as a Middle East policy expert. His role in the Iran-contra arms smuggling scandal was sufficiently important to force George Bush Sr to withdraw his the nomination as army secretary in 1989. Mr Armitage worked closely with Colonel Oliver North in the secret Reagan White House effort to trade arms to Iran and syphon some of the profits to Nicaraguan contra rebels in defiance of an arms ban. Last week Mr Bush appointed another Reagan era veteran, Paul Wolfowitz, to the number two job in the defence department under Donald Rumsfeld. Mr Wolfowitz was a key policymaker at the state department during the Reagan years and is the administration's most senior Asian policy expert. He is expected to be the arbiter of any attempts to place deploy US missile defences in Japan, South Korea or Taiwan. Other appointments of cold war era officials have included Dov Zakheim as under-secretary of defence, a more senior version of the departmental planning role he played at the Pentagon in the Reagan years. Mr Bush has also brought back Richard Haass as head of policy planning at the state department. Last week he put Grant Green, a Reagan national security council official, in charge of management policy in the state department. The appointments replicate the pattern of continuity that was striking in Mr Bush's cabinet choices for foreign and defence posts. With Mr Powell already at the state department and Mr Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, the new administration's foreign policy is indisputably in the grip of experienced experts who learned their trade in the final years of the cold war. So far there has only been one appointment in the foreign policy field which does not fit the pattern, that of the career diplomat Marc Grossman as head of political affairs at the state department. As the administration takes shape, the key man in both domestic and foreign policy is still clearly the vice-president, Dick Cheney. This week he was reported to be trying to tighten his conservative grip on foreign policymaking by taking charge of the White House's \"principals\" committee, in which cabinet members hammer out policy options to be put to the president. In the past this role has been played by the national security adviser, a post now held by Condoleezza Rice, who tutored Mr Bush on foreign policy during the election campaign. Newsweek magazine alleged this week that Mr Cheney waspressing his claim to chair the committee, and trying to push Ms Rice aside. In addition, he was reported to be hiring his own team of foreign policy staff and to be building \"the nucleus of an alternative national security committee\". To many observers the crucial question in the early weeks of the administration is the extent to which the more liberal Mr Powell will be able to get his way in the event of a policy disagreement with the more conservative Mr Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld. Mr Powell has distanced himself from Mr Bush's decision to cut off US funding to international bodies which provide or support abortion services, and has adopted a more favourable stance than Mr Rumsfeld towards EU for plans for a military rapid response force.",

Beset by some of the worst publicity he has faced since the impeachment crisis of 1998-99, he went to Harlem to announce that he wants to put his post-presidential office there rather than in the much more expensive Manhattan site he had chosen earlier. \"I have decided to locate my office in this building if we can work it out,\" he told a cheering crowd outside 55 West 125th Street. Smiling and waving, Mr Clinton proceeded to offer a reprise of one of the things he does best, a walkabout, during which he shook hundreds of black and white hands in the crowded streets of New York. The latest twist in the story that looks like taking Mr Clinton from the White House to the heart of the most celebrated black district in the United States was executed with the kind of theatre - and with several of the same cast - that has marked the ups and downs of his career. Mr Clinton said he had decided to try to move after consulting his old golfing friend Vernon Jordan, as well as the Harlem congressman Charlie Rangel and the junior senator for the state of New York, his wife Hillary. \"She loved it,\" he said. If he agrees a Harlem tenancy, Mr Clinton will not be paying the $738,700 (\u00a3505,950) annual rent he would have had to pay if he had gone ahead with renting the 56th floor of the Carnegie Hall Tower on West 57th Street, just south of Central Park. Estimates put the top floor of the 14-storey Harlem office building at about $210,000 (\u00a3143,800) for 7,000 sq ft (650 sq metres) He will sacrifice the delights of the Russian Tea Room near the Carnegie building, but gain the Bayou Cajun restaurant and a new branch of a big coffee chain. Mr Clinton had asked the US government to pay the whole of the rent of the suite in the Carnegie building, but protests caused him to scale down his request last week to just over $330,000 a year, the Clinton presidential library fund making up the rest. In Harlem his claim on federal funds will be significantly lower than that made by his immediate White House predecessors. In addition to sparing taxpayers a big rental bill, he clearly hopes that moving to Harlem will win him some desperately needed good publicity, because several of his acts at the very end of his presidency last month are getting him into ever hotter political and legal water. Yesterday might have been good for him in news management terms, but he is in particular trouble for unconditionally pardoning he fugitive financier Marc Rich on January 20, just before handing over to George Bush. A Senate committee is due to open inquiries today into whether this pardon was properly given in accordance with the rules governing presidential powers. The justice department, for instance, says it was kept in the dark because it would have strongly opposed the pardon. The committee chairman, Senator Arlen Specter, created further headlines at the weekend by saying that Mr Clinton could face impeachment charges arising from the pardon, even though he has left office. \"I'm not suggesting it should be done, but President Clinton technically could still be impeached,\" he told Fox News on Sunday. A separate House of Representatives' inquiry into the Rich pardon is also well under way. Yesterday officials of the House committee on government reform issued several subpoenas for further evidence on the issue, including one to the White House secret service for logs of Mr Clinton's visitors in January. The House committee, headed by a frequent Clinton nemesis, Congressman Dan Burton, is expected to offer immunity this week to Mr Rich's former wife Denise, who has given a great deal of money to the Democratic party, in return for her testimony. Last week Mrs Rich invoked her constitutional right not to testify to the committee, a decision which increased the suspicion that she has damaging information about the negotiations that led to the pardon. This week's issue of US News &amp; World Report magazine carried a claim that Mrs Rich had donated at least $10m (\u00a36.8m) to Mr Clinton's presidential library foundation.

      "body": "<p>So renowned is Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798) for his sexual exploits that we now tend to forget the man, the historical character, and talk only of a philandering type, still alive and well more than two centuries later. But the original Casanova - the inspiration for Suspect Culture's new play opening tonight, appropriately - was far more than simply a Venetian Mr Lover-Lover. </p> <p>Soldier, diplomat, writer, adventurer and spy for Louis XV, he also introduced the concept of a lottery to Paris in 1757 before settling down to pen his 28-volume memoir, from which we get our image of him as an insatiable Lothario. Like many men since, he isn't the most reliable narrator of his own sexual history, but we do know he seduced 132 women, had his first sexual experience at 11 and his second, with two sisters, very soon after. His greatest love, Henriette, was a cross-dresser who passed herself off as a castrato. At one point, he seduces and nearly marries the offspring of one of his ex-lovers.

      "bodyText": "So renowned is Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798) for his sexual exploits that we now tend to forget the man, the historical character, and talk only of a philandering type, still alive and well more than two centuries later. But the original Casanova - the inspiration for Suspect Culture's new play opening tonight, appropriately - was far more than simply a Venetian Mr Lover-Lover. Soldier, diplomat, writer, adventurer and spy for Louis XV, he also introduced the concept of a lottery to Paris in 1757 before settling down to pen his 28-volume memoir, from which we get our image of him as an insatiable Lothario. Like many men since, he isn't the most reliable narrator of his own sexual history, but we do know he seduced 132 women, had his first sexual experience at 11 and his second, with two sisters, very soon after. His greatest love, Henriette, was a cross-dresser who passed herself off as a castrato. At one point, he seduces and nearly marries the offspring of one of his ex-lovers. She turns out to be his own daughter. With this kind of track record, scandal and venereal disease were Casanova's constant companions. In later life, after one too many bouts of the pox, imprisonment and exile, he took up the quiet life, working as a librarian in a Bohemian castle and penning his life story.

      "body": "<p>Guten Tag, Dipsy!\" \"Eh-oh! Tinky Winky! Did you know, Tinky Winky, that it is easier for the individual to follow the group than to think for himself?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, that's interesting, Dipsy!\" </p> <p>You probably didn't realise it, but we have a lot to thank German kabarett for, not least because in Berlin a troupe of kabarett artistes has transformed the Teletubbies from gurgling, dippy blobs into fluent reciters of Brecht. The performers, Dresden-based Herkuleskeule, are among the many German troupes caught up in celebrations for the centenary of kabarett or performed satire. </p> <p>The story behind kabarett provides an entertaining insight into recent German history, spanning the Weimar republic, the rise of Nazism, the communist era and the post-reunification period. It is perhaps best known to the outside world through the Liza Minnelli film Cabaret, but aficionados claim there is far more to it than that. </p> <p>Kabarett was born on January 18 1901 with the opening of the first kabarett theatre. Inspired by evenings spent in Paris at Chat Noir, an artists' cafe that promoted socially critical \"cabaret artistique\" where poets and entertainers would do a turn on the stage in return for free beer, Ernst von Wollzogen decided to build his own theatre in Berlin. </p> <p>He intended to produce high-quality artistic entertainment as a counterweight to the trashy music hall fare that dominated the city's stages at the time. But the German model immediately diverged from the French cabaret, as Wollzogen drew satirical magazine writers, composers and out-of-work actors to his stage to perform their often subversive songs. Soon they were developing the sharp individual style that typifies Berlin kabarett to this day. (It wasn't until the 1930s that the social commentator Kurt Tucholsky \"Germanised\" the word cabaret, derived from the French word for a tavern, thus making the distinction between the two forms - the frivolous and erotic versus the serious, intellectual and darkly humorous.) </p> <p>Audiences and potential performers both caught on quickly. In kabarett's first year of life, 40 groups applied for licences to start performing in Berlin. They were diverse in style, some following the French model, while others were more political in content. </p> <p>\"Initially,\" says Peter Sprengel, professor in early German literature at Berlin's Free University, \"there was a utopian idea that people could be educated and taught a sense of taste, but before long those aims were forgotten and commercial interests were dictating the programme.\" </p> <p>Women had an important role from the start. A leading female light was Marya Delvard, who with her husband Marc Henry took kabarett to Vienna in 1906. After the first world war a pair of women, Rosa Valetti and Trude Hesterberg, injected new life into Berlin kabarett with their respective groups, Great Delusion and Wild Stage. Bertolt Brecht performed at the latter in 1922, causing a scandal with his anti-militaristic songs. </p> <p>\"It's one of kabarett's great strengths that it's so flexible,\" says Joanne McNally, a research fellow at the University of London. \"The three elements that make up kabarett - political and social criticism, entertainment, and the artistic aesthetic - can all shift according to the political climate, the ethos of the group or their location,\" she says. </p> <p>She cites the group Die Wespen (\"the wasps\"), for which Brecht and Eric Muhsam wrote, and which at the end of the Weimar period used to play up the erotic elements as a cover for their hard-hitting political criticism. </p> <p>Die Katakombe, another group which had its heyday at the end of the Weimar republic, had to employ very indirect criticism. One of its members, Werner Finc, developed a style where he would deliver taboo words with a deliberate stammer or by immediately retracting what he'd said, suggesting he'd made a mistake. Words such as \"Dachau\" were delivered in an off-hand manner as performers left the stage, to alert audiences to the existence of the concentration camps. \"Fincisms\" were later used to great effect under communism in east Germany. </p> <p>Very little survived the Nazi clampdown in 1935, when many performers, particularly Jews, were forced to flee. Yet in the last place kabarett might have been expected to have any life, it thrived, albeit briefly. In the concentration camps it provided a few hours of light relief. \"The subject matter was less political,\" says McNally. \"It focused on the inmates' daily concerns, such as hoping for a food parcel or a better future.\" </p> <p>Volker K\u00fchn, a cabaret writer who has made a documentary film about kabarett in the con centration camps, says: \"It seems absurd, but so were the times, and the locations were far removed from reality,\" he explains. \"Kabarett became a survival strategy for the performers.\" </p> <p>In some camps kabarett was banned, in others it was tolerated, but in Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands, the camp commander was a huge fan and ordered a performance at least once a week. In Theresienstadt 40,000 would typically attend, and it wasn't unusual for three or four performances to be listed every day. </p> <p>It was not until the 1950s that kabarett became a political force again. But stability has never been a typical feature of the environment in which kabarett has thrived. Soon Berlin was in two halves, separated by a wall. Eastern and western kabarett almost became two different art forms during the 40 years of division. But realising its importance to the people, the communist authorities ordered regular kabarett performances. </p> <p>Die Distel (\"The Thistle\"), still Berlin's most famous kabarett theatre, was the east's first professional kabarett house. The first programme was wryly titled: \"Humour is part of the overall plan.\" But there were strict rules. Solo performers were not allowed and texts were strictly controlled and could not be changed once the stamp of approval had been given. </p> <p>As a result, eastern kabarett had a very rigid structure. \"It was up to the audience to do a lot of reconstruction,\" says McNally. \"Strategic ambiguity was adopted where the audience had to supply the critical content.\" </p> <p>Absolute taboo subjects were GDR leader Erich Honecker and the Stasi, so a subtle form of language was developed to compensate. Thus Honecker was referred to as \"the supreme clown\". But clever intonation, a pause at a key moment, or delivery of a punchline in a mumble was enough to radically change a text from its meaning on the page. </p> <p>After the fall of the Berlin wall, with nothing left to satirise, it was feared that kabarett would not survive. Audiences drifted away, but by 1992 the public was knocking on the door again. \"After the fall of the wall we felt we didn't need satire any more, but then we realised that it was maybe even more necessary,\" says Helge, an easterner, on a night out with her girlfriends at Die Distel, where I found most of the audience to be from the west. Die Distel was privatised in 1991 and it is no mean feat that, in the brutal world of capitalism, all 12 of the former GDR's cabaret groups have survived the transition. There's now increasing evidence of eastern and western audiences mixing, as well as a crossover between writers and performers. </p> <p>So just why is it such a Berlin artform? \"It would be too subtle for the Americans,\" says Sprengel. \"But Berlin has experienced many political variations, and that keeps kabarett on its toes, although how much it changes things is debatable.\" </p> <p>It certainly shows no sign of going out of fashion. McNally uses it for advanced language teaching, the Bundestag has its own posse of kabarett artistes, and it is even used as a way of improving employer-employee relations and production levels in German companies. </p> <p>And you thought the Germans didn't know how to laugh?</p>",

Very little survived the Nazi clampdown in 1935, when many performers, particularly Jews, were forced to flee. Yet in the last place kabarett might have been expected to have any life, it thrived, albeit briefly. In the concentration camps it provided a few hours of light relief. \"The subject matter was less political,\" says McNally. \"It focused on the inmates' daily concerns, such as hoping for a food parcel or a better future.\" Volker K\u00fchn, a cabaret writer who has made a documentary film about kabarett in the con centration camps, says: \"It seems absurd, but so were the times, and the locations were far removed from reality,\" he explains. \"Kabarett became a survival strategy for the performers.\" In some camps kabarett was banned, in others it was tolerated, but in Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands, the camp commander was a huge fan and ordered a performance at least once a week. In Theresienstadt 40,000 would typically attend, and it wasn't unusual for three or four performances to be listed every day. It was not until the 1950s that kabarett became a political force again. But stability has never been a typical feature of the environment in which kabarett has thrived. Soon Berlin was in two halves, separated by a wall. Eastern and western kabarett almost became two different art forms during the 40 years of division. But realising its importance to the people, the communist authorities ordered regular kabarett performances. Die Distel (\"The Thistle\"), still Berlin's most famous kabarett theatre, was the east's first professional kabarett house. The first programme was wryly titled: \"Humour is part of the overall plan.\" But there were strict rules. Solo performers were not allowed and texts were strictly controlled and could not be changed once the stamp of approval had been given. As a result, eastern kabarett had a very rigid structure. \"It was up to the audience to do a lot of reconstruction,\" says McNally. \"Strategic ambiguity was adopted where the audience had to supply the critical content.\" Absolute taboo subjects were GDR leader Erich Honecker and the Stasi, so a subtle form of language was developed to compensate. Thus Honecker was referred to as \"the supreme clown\". But clever intonation, a pause at a key moment, or delivery of a punchline in a mumble was enough to radically change a text from its meaning on the page. After the fall of the Berlin wall, with nothing left to satirise, it was feared that kabarett would not survive. Audiences drifted away, but by 1992 the public was knocking on the door again. \"After the fall of the wall we felt we didn't need satire any more, but then we realised that it was maybe even more necessary,\" says Helge, an easterner, on a night out with her girlfriends at Die Distel, where I found most of the audience to be from the west. Die Distel was privatised in 1991 and it is no mean feat that, in the brutal world of capitalism, all 12 of the former GDR's cabaret groups have survived the transition. There's now increasing evidence of eastern and western audiences mixing, as well as a crossover between writers and performers. So just why is it such a Berlin artform? \"It would be too subtle for the Americans,\" says Sprengel. \"But Berlin has experienced many political variations, and that keeps kabarett on its toes, although how much it changes things is debatable.\" It certainly shows no sign of going out of fashion. McNally uses it for advanced language teaching, the Bundestag has its own posse of kabarett artistes, and it is even used as a way of improving employer-employee relations and production levels in German companies. And you thought the Germans didn't know how to laugh?",

Even if they are still grudgingly prepared to pay it for an album they feel they must own, they know very well that the Americans and many of our European confr\u00e8res are paying about four quid less. But in the same way that a combination of the internet, EU regulations and mounting consumer indignation has belatedly delivered a wounding blow to the price-fixing racket in the UK motor industry, record companies and music retailers have arrived at a watershed.

In fact they're going to do so whether prices fall or not, so the question is how much the industry can slow the process down and limit the damage to its profits. </p> <p>All eyes in the pop biz have been on this week's court of appeal ruling in California to determine the fate of the internet music company Napster, and its potential impact on the future of internet music delivery. Metallica, one of the world's most obscenely wealthy rock acts, are crowing triumphantly about the court's decision that Napster must prevent copyrighted material from being exchanged over its network.

      "bodyText": "In the 1980s, a caller to Steve Wright's Radio 1 show was asked \"who's mad?\" each day. \"Who's mad?\" he replied, \"I'll tell you who's mad. Mr X, he's raving mad, pal. And that ****, she's mad ...\" Anyone in the news, it seemed, was mad. Now Steve Wright and his posse have shuffled off to Radio 2, and we have Alastair Campbell instead. Barely had New Labour won power before Ali resurrected the Soviet tactic of labelling all opponents as insane, ill, or mentally enfeebled. Mandy is the latest in a long line, and today, as a tribute to the subtlety of Ali's technique and the variety of his euphemisms, we relive the highlights. \u0095 In October 1997, \"a Downing Street source\" briefed that David Clark, who'd been rash enough to propose a freedom of information bill with teeth, would be out in the next reshuffle since he \"has totally lost it\" and was the \"despair of his civil servants\". A relentless campaign ensued until he went a year later. \u0095 The neo-Brezhnevite era's first high point came in January 1998, when the Observer was briefed that Gordon Brown was \"psychologically flawed\". Others have been implicated, but who else at Number 10 had the authority to sanction delivery of so explosive a package to a newspaper? \u0095 Meanwhile, transport secretary Gavin Strang was not only \"weak\" and \"not quite up to it, but so lavishly demented as to be quite unaware of the serious kidney disorder that would, hacks were briefed in early 1998, soon enforce his departure. Even though he thought himself \"the fittest member of the cabinet\", he soon went. Well, he had to. He was a bit, you know, up top. \u0095 When Aberdeen scientist Dr Arpad Pusztai revealed that lab rats fed on GM potatoes had developed weak immune systems, hacks were told the doctor was \"a bit of a nutter\". \u0095 By June 1999, Harriet Harman (\"incapable of joined-up thinking\") and Frank Field (\"a complete joke\") had gone, when TUC boss John Monks blamed the euro elections fiasco on disdain for traditional support.

Always in <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC 1) a reason to take to the hills. </p> <p>St Valentine's Day is, of course, less critical than Christmas, which regularly detonates with such brio that debris is still descending in soft flakes in spring. But there are few more ominous sights than a gangster who hasn't had a Valentine's card, and Phil Mitchell is fuming. On the day when traditionally all the little birds begin their courtship, he has not got a bird. Lisa has flown. Admittedly, not far. My own inclination, if I left Phil Mitchell, would be to take up residence in a small submarine somewhere off North Uist, but Lisa is hiding close by. </p> <p>Phil has been flinging himself at assorted doors, growling like a pit bull trying to get in a cat flap. Or imagine Albert Square as a snooker table and Phil as a bald, red ball trying all the pockets. There, that wasn't difficult, was it? </p> <p>Since she took up with Phil, Lisa has looked like a bag of broken biscuits. Once quite a custard cream, the woman's now in crumbs. According to Phil she frowed a moody. \"I've looked after 'er for months. She's moaned and whined, that's all she's done. She's made a right mug out of me.\" And, suiting the action to the word, he flung his mug at the wall. </p> <p>Let us turn, hopefully, to more level heads. Phil's mother, Peggy, and Roy are drowning their sorrows in single malt. He tells her about his impotence and she tells him about her mastectomy. Roy is sympathetic: \"The next time you have a moan, come to me and we'll bore the pants off each other.\" Peggy unwisely interprets this literally and Roy, a shy second-hand car dealer, exits stage right as if pursued by a bear. </p> <p>Henry (Anthony Head) in <strong> Silent Witness</strong> (BBC 1) is the reddest herring ever waved under my incredulous nose. Henry is gentry, but what a bounder, and never more so than when blowing suavely on his snooker cue tip. He has fathered a child with his own daughter (\"In our family, a generation or two back such behaviour was de rigueur\"), and plies the nubile daughters of the peasantry with Mo\u00ebt and Chandon (\"Put a couple more on ice!\") The phrase is particularly unfortunate, as murdered girls keep turning up in snowfields and deep freezers. Scotland Yard lollop along after this fishy distraction with their ears blowing in the wind. Fortunately, the fair Miss Formaldehyde (Amanda Burton) is on the job and spots it is the chauffeur. </p> <p>The ever entertaining <strong> Blood On The Carpet</strong> (BBC 2) did not tell us how Wavy Gravy got his name. Though I felt myself yanked back to Railway Cuttings as if on elastic and heard Tony Hancock saying resentfully that his mother couldn't cook but at least her gravy moved around the plate a bit. Ten to one, Wavy Gravy has forgotten how he got the name. He helped to run the Woodstock rock festival in 1969 and he can't remember a thing about that either. A sure sign of the 60s. Wavy was in charge of security at Woodstock. He gave the matter some serious thought and hired a bear suit and a rubber shovel. \"Should some hippie build a stupid fire, I could leap out of the bushes in my bear suit and wave my shovel at them.\" </p> <p>When the second Woodstock was held in 1999, Wavy was there with bells on and a fish on a leash. </p> <p>Don't worry about it. </p> <p>It began promisingly. Wavy said, \"All the kids would recognise me and get me to sign their head or their girlfriend or they'd pat my fish.\" But eventually the heat, the price of hot dogs and an incendiary band called Limp Bizkit inflamed the crowd. And a supply of free candles inflamed anything else that would burn. Wavy did his hippie best. He stood on the stage wafting sage and reciting a mantra. In view of the crowd's ugly mood, one can only be grateful he was not wearing his bear suit. </p> <p>In the words of Limp Bizkit, \"Motherfucker, it's just one of those days.\" Astonishingly, it took five people to write that number. One more than it took to write, \"Horsey, keep your tail up. Keep the sun out of my eyes.\" On balance I prefer Horsey. </p> <p>\"Can I watch telly?\" The first words of Adam, Mike Baldwin's long lost son, arriving in <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (Granada). All his relations agreed at once that he must be deeply concussed. \"He's still very groggy and confused.\"</p>",

Phil has been flinging himself at assorted doors, growling like a pit bull trying to get in a cat flap. Or imagine Albert Square as a snooker table and Phil as a bald, red ball trying all the pockets. There, that wasn't difficult, was it? Since she took up with Phil, Lisa has looked like a bag of broken biscuits. Once quite a custard cream, the woman's now in crumbs. According to Phil she frowed a moody. \"I've looked after 'er for months. She's moaned and whined, that's all she's done. She's made a right mug out of me.\" And, suiting the action to the word, he flung his mug at the wall. Let us turn, hopefully, to more level heads. Phil's mother, Peggy, and Roy are drowning their sorrows in single malt. He tells her about his impotence and she tells him about her mastectomy. Roy is sympathetic: \"The next time you have a moan, come to me and we'll bore the pants off each other.\" Peggy unwisely interprets this literally and Roy, a shy second-hand car dealer, exits stage right as if pursued by a bear. Henry (Anthony Head) in Silent Witness (BBC 1) is the reddest herring ever waved under my incredulous nose. Henry is gentry, but what a bounder, and never more so than when blowing suavely on his snooker cue tip. He has fathered a child with his own daughter (\"In our family, a generation or two back such behaviour was de rigueur\"), and plies the nubile daughters of the peasantry with Mo\u00ebt and Chandon (\"Put a couple more on ice!\") The phrase is particularly unfortunate, as murdered girls keep turning up in snowfields and deep freezers. Scotland Yard lollop along after this fishy distraction with their ears blowing in the wind. Fortunately, the fair Miss Formaldehyde (Amanda Burton) is on the job and spots it is the chauffeur. The ever entertaining Blood On The Carpet (BBC 2) did not tell us how Wavy Gravy got his name. Though I felt myself yanked back to Railway Cuttings as if on elastic and heard Tony Hancock saying resentfully that his mother couldn't cook but at least her gravy moved around the plate a bit. Ten to one, Wavy Gravy has forgotten how he got the name. He helped to run the Woodstock rock festival in 1969 and he can't remember a thing about that either. A sure sign of the 60s. Wavy was in charge of security at Woodstock. He gave the matter some serious thought and hired a bear suit and a rubber shovel. \"Should some hippie build a stupid fire, I could leap out of the bushes in my bear suit and wave my shovel at them.\" When the second Woodstock was held in 1999, Wavy was there with bells on and a fish on a leash. Don't worry about it. It began promisingly. Wavy said, \"All the kids would recognise me and get me to sign their head or their girlfriend or they'd pat my fish.\" But eventually the heat, the price of hot dogs and an incendiary band called Limp Bizkit inflamed the crowd. And a supply of free candles inflamed anything else that would burn. Wavy did his hippie best. He stood on the stage wafting sage and reciting a mantra. In view of the crowd's ugly mood, one can only be grateful he was not wearing his bear suit. In the words of Limp Bizkit, \"Motherfucker, it's just one of those days.\" Astonishingly, it took five people to write that number. One more than it took to write, \"Horsey, keep your tail up. Keep the sun out of my eyes.\" On balance I prefer Horsey. \"Can I watch telly?\" The first words of Adam, Mike Baldwin's long lost son, arriving in Coronation Street (Granada). All his relations agreed at once that he must be deeply concussed. \"He's still very groggy and confused.\"",

Scientists found three female Lord Howe Island stick insects, which they likened to \"walking sausages\", after scrambling up a cliff in the dark on Balls Pyramid, a volcanic rock 23km (14 miles) from Lord Howe Island. The nocturnal insect, once native to Lord Howe Island, evolved into a 15cm-long wingless giant, with a reddish brown body 1.5cm thick, because it had no predators. For thousands of years, the remote island was home to only one mammal species - a bat - and two species of reptile. But the stick insect, known locally as the \"land lobster\", became extinct after rats colonised the island from a shipwreck in 1918. Rumoured sightings of sausage-shaped carcasses by rock climbers on Balls Pyramid in the 1960s encouraged the latest expedition by Australian scientists, who found the three specimens of Phasmid Dryococelus Australis feasting on tea-tree bushes. \"I was lost for words, except for the odd expletive,\" scientist Nicholas Carlile told the Sydney Morning Herald. \"We couldn't jump for joy for fear of falling off the 60-degree slope.\" The scientists, who also found a number of eggs, believe there could be just 10 adults surviving on the desolate rock.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is under mounting pressure to cut interest rates after the government's key measure of inflation plunged to a 25-year low in January. The drop to 1.8% from 2% in December was mainly driven by lower oil and petrol costs which have since rebounded, but it also reflected sluggish house prices and cheaper household goods and services. Underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, has been below the government's 2.5% prices target for 22 months in a row, and is perilously close to the 1.5% level which triggers a public letter from the bank's governor, Sir Eddie George, to the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998, Sir Eddie would have to explain why inflation has fallen a full percentage point below target and set out a strategy for getting it back on track. Although the Bank cut rates last week by 0.25% to 5.75% to reflate the economy, most City economists believe that further cuts in the cost of bor rowing will be needed to boost the rate of price increases. The Bank will set out its thinking on the outlook for inflation and interest rates when it publishes its quarterly inflation report today. Since the US federal reserve began cutting interest rates aggressively at the beginning of January to boost collapsing business and consumer confidence, other central banks have been expected to follow suit. But economic activity in Europe has remained relatively robust, making both the Bank of England and the European central bank (ECB) wary of overstimulating demand.

Clergy and lay members of the board of the National Faith Centre in Bradford closed the centre's doors after legal advice that they risked insolvency if they carried on trading. The \u00a35m attraction, also known as Life Force and designed to celebrate and explain humankind's history of religious belief, opened with a \u00a32.2m millennium lottery grant last July.

The acting dean of Bradford Cathedral, Derek Jackson, who has managed the project since the resignation of board mem ber Manoj Joshi last month, said the closure had been agreed with \"deep regret\". After advice from insolvency practitioners, the centre's two operating companies, both named after St Peter, have gone into administration - suspending possible claims by creditors. A spokeswoman for the millennium commission, which welcomed a major religious project when the bid was approved, said staff were working with Bradford Cathedral, the main partner in the inter-faith scheme, to find a way forward. \"Obviously, from the commission's point of view, we are very disappointed,\" she said.

A day after Mr Mandelson gave evidence to the inquiry, Norman Baker, the Liberal De mocrat MP for Lewes, whose Commons question precipitated the crisis, warned that the retired QC's report may be too \"narrow\" to get to the bottom of the affair. He said Sir Anthony had interviewed him. \"He said he had not been subject to influence by ministers,\" Mr Baker said in a reference to the \"stitch-up\" theory shared by both the Mandelson camp and by some Labour MPs who are not his supporters. But a Labour loyalist MP said: \"People don't know what is going on, so inevitably it raises suspicions that a bit of an old boys' network is in operation - and will lead to a mutually agreed conclusion.' In the latest twist, it is now being claimed that Mr Mandelson may after all have briefly intervened in a telephone conversation made by Emma Scott, an official in his private office in 1998. It was made to her opposite number working for Mike O'Brien, then immigration minister, when the Hinduja brothers asked about Labour's revised passport policy. It later emerged that they were giving \u00a31m to the Millennium Dome. SP Hinduja got his passport the following year.

Her Betty is an elemental force moving in on unsuspecting writer Jean-Hugues Anglade, and championing his unpublished novel; he is charmed, but soon horrified by her self-destructive intensity. Like Beineix's Diva, this is archetypal Cin\u00e9ma du Look, an exercise in pure, seductive, style.",

      "bodyText": "A civilian guest was at the helm of the US submarine which rammed and sank a Japanese fishing boat off the coast of Hawaii on Friday, from which nine people are still missing, the Pentagon admitted yesterday. A US defence official did not name the civilian involved but said there was no indication that his or her presence caused the accident. The navy spokesman, Commander Greg Smith, said that visiting civilians were often allowed in US submarines. He said it would not be unusual for a visitor to be allowed to sit in one of the vessel's three helm positions, to get an impression of what it was like to command a submarine. It is thought that the civilian was sitting at controls which regulates the submarine's heading and angle, but defence officials stressed that submariners would have been on hand at every moment to keep control of the vessel. \"The civilian is not in control of any actions that were not ordered by the commanding officer,\" the commander said. The submarine, the Greeneville, hit the Japanese ship Ehine Maru as it surfaced at high speed from a depth of 120 metres (400ft) as part of an emergency drill. The Ehine Maru was holed in the stern and sank in minutes. Twenty-six passengers were rescued but nine are still missing, including four 17-year-old fisheries students. There were reportedly 16 civilians on board the submarine. Reports quoting an unnamed official said they were local community and business leaders. Other reports said none were \"major public figures\". The accident investigation is focusing on the use of sonar to ascertain what vessels were in the area when surfacing.

      "body": "<p>S ir Herbert Ashworth, who has died aged 90, was chairman of Britain's third largest building society, the Nationwide, from 1970 to 1982 and made a major contribution to the growth of the building society movement from the late 1930s to the 1980s. During this period, home ownership expanded to more than 60% and building society membership was seen within most families.</p> <p>Ashworth left his local grammar school in Burnley at the age of 15, and joined the Burnley Building Society as a junior clerk, at a salary of \u00a330 a year. He continued his studies by taking an external London University degree in economics and law.</p> <p>After 10 years, he moved to the London-based Portman Building Society, where he became general manager. In 1950, he was appointed general manager of the Co-operative Permanent Building Society (CPBS), then the fourth largest in the country.</p> <p>While not legally a cooperative society, and being a fully independent organisation, the CPBS did hold considerable deposits received from the cooperative societies, which, if withdrawn en bloc, would cause liquidity problems. Ashworth realised this danger and had the vision to widen the society's appeal to the public at large.</p> <p>He set out to greatly expand the branch network. Young men enthusiastically scoured the land to secure inexpensive and temporary premises from which to secure new mortgage and savings business. From these early beginnings, prime high street branches were established, the vast majority of which remain today.</p> <p>With his flair for market-ing and public relations, Ashworth used leading-edge forms of advertising, such as television - then a \"first\" for a financial organisation - and press conferences dealing with the housing market and the economy as well as CPBS progress, which received wide coverage.</p> <p>The result was to enhance Ashworth's reputation and, with strong government support for home ownership, the growth rate of the CPBS greatly accelerated, easily outstripping its rivals. In 1961, by which time the society was the third largest in the country, and he had completed 10 years' service, Ashworth resigned as general manager and became a director and general manager of Hallmark Securities, a property company. At the next annual general meeting of the CPBS, he was elected a non-executive director of the society.</p> <p>The 1960s saw a continuing growth in the building society industry, but the CPBS was not faring so well. Attracting new business was becoming difficult because of an assumed connection of the society with the cooperative movement. At that time, small business people saw the Co-op as a competitor, and those members of the public who did not support socialist principles shied away.</p> <p>In 1969, lack of confidence in a small, obscure co-op in Cumbria led to widespread withdrawal of capital across all cooperative societies, along with the CPBS, much to the alarm of Ashworth and his colleagues. This situation led to a decision in 1970 to change the name - from Co-operative Permanent Building Society to Nationwide - and, soon afterwards, Ashworth was elected chairman.</p> <p>From then on, the society went from strength to strength. Ashworth proved himself a first-class chairman, establishing an excellent board and ensuring both management and staff were able to perform their roles in an enlightened environment.</p> <p>Ashworth was also vice-chairman of the Housing Corporation from 1964, becoming chairman in 1968, a post he held for five years. He was knighted in 1972. An avid reader, he wrote a number of books, including The Building Society Story (1980). He was a great fan of horse racing and could see the grandstand at Epsom racecourse from his house.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their three children.</p> <p>Herbert Ashworth, building society leader, born January 30 1910; died December 29 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "S ir Herbert Ashworth, who has died aged 90, was chairman of Britain's third largest building society, the Nationwide, from 1970 to 1982 and made a major contribution to the growth of the building society movement from the late 1930s to the 1980s. During this period, home ownership expanded to more than 60% and building society membership was seen within most families. Ashworth left his local grammar school in Burnley at the age of 15, and joined the Burnley Building Society as a junior clerk, at a salary of \u00a330 a year. He continued his studies by taking an external London University degree in economics and law. After 10 years, he moved to the London-based Portman Building Society, where he became general manager. In 1950, he was appointed general manager of the Co-operative Permanent Building Society (CPBS), then the fourth largest in the country. While not legally a cooperative society, and being a fully independent organisation, the CPBS did hold considerable deposits received from the cooperative societies, which, if withdrawn en bloc, would cause liquidity problems. Ashworth realised this danger and had the vision to widen the society's appeal to the public at large. He set out to greatly expand the branch network. Young men enthusiastically scoured the land to secure inexpensive and temporary premises from which to secure new mortgage and savings business. From these early beginnings, prime high street branches were established, the vast majority of which remain today. With his flair for market-ing and public relations, Ashworth used leading-edge forms of advertising, such as television - then a \"first\" for a financial organisation - and press conferences dealing with the housing market and the economy as well as CPBS progress, which received wide coverage. The result was to enhance Ashworth's reputation and, with strong government support for home ownership, the growth rate of the CPBS greatly accelerated, easily outstripping its rivals. In 1961, by which time the society was the third largest in the country, and he had completed 10 years' service, Ashworth resigned as general manager and became a director and general manager of Hallmark Securities, a property company. At the next annual general meeting of the CPBS, he was elected a non-executive director of the society. The 1960s saw a continuing growth in the building society industry, but the CPBS was not faring so well. Attracting new business was becoming difficult because of an assumed connection of the society with the cooperative movement. At that time, small business people saw the Co-op as a competitor, and those members of the public who did not support socialist principles shied away. In 1969, lack of confidence in a small, obscure co-op in Cumbria led to widespread withdrawal of capital across all cooperative societies, along with the CPBS, much to the alarm of Ashworth and his colleagues. This situation led to a decision in 1970 to change the name - from Co-operative Permanent Building Society to Nationwide - and, soon afterwards, Ashworth was elected chairman. From then on, the society went from strength to strength. Ashworth proved himself a first-class chairman, establishing an excellent board and ensuring both management and staff were able to perform their roles in an enlightened environment. Ashworth was also vice-chairman of the Housing Corporation from 1964, becoming chairman in 1968, a post he held for five years. He was knighted in 1972. An avid reader, he wrote a number of books, including The Building Society Story (1980). He was a great fan of horse racing and could see the grandstand at Epsom racecourse from his house. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their three children. Herbert Ashworth, building society leader, born January 30 1910; died December 29 2000",

Six homes and one business were searched, though it is understood no weapons or bombs were found. The men were being held last night at a police station in central London under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which gives the police powers to arrest suspects believed to be \"commissioning, instigating, or preparing acts of terrorism\".

It is known that the four suspects are aged 31, 33, 38 and 40. Whitehall sources, however, said the two-month investigation had not been able to identify specific targets. But sources confirmed the men were allegedly planning attacks in Europe rather than Algeria or the Middle East. The four are not connected with Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant extremist based in Afghanistan, or any other known group, including Algeria's Armed Islamic Group suspected of carrying out terrorist attacks in France and Algeria, according to the sources. They allegedly took up jihad - holy war - independently and were not part of any \"structured group\".

I have to take money from my family. But it is hard to do without this,\" he said, clutching in his hand a slip of silver foil holding a small brown bead of heroin.</p> <p>He buys two grams a day from a local peddler, which costs him about 200 rupees (\u00a32.40). Most addicts can get enough to sustain them by begging.</p> <p>\"The big shots, we never see them here. We are suffering but they have made a fortune from us and we have lost everything.\"</p> <p>A distraught mother, her hair covered in a blue shawl, came running under the bridge. \"</p> <p>Where is my son? Where is Salam?\" she screamed at the addicts.</p> <p>\"My son was an addict and then he went to jail. Now he has come out and started again. I want him to be treated but I don't have the money. Just catch him and hand him over to the police, at least he will be free from the drugs.\"</p>",

At the age of 50 this grey-bearded figure is respected locally as a religious Muslim who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca and frequently gives money to the poor. But HJK, as Pakistan's anti-narcotics officers call him, also runs one of Afghanistan's biggest heroin production and smuggling operations. For the past seven years he has shipped heroin through the golden deserts of western Pakistan into Iran and eventually on to the streets of Britain. \"They say he is a man with a simple lifestyle, but in terms of dollars he is a millionaire,\" said Brigadier Abdul Razaq Baloch, who leads the anti-narcotics force in the town of Quetta, near the border with Afghanistan. \"The biggest problem is arresting him.\" His base near the Afghan frontier village of Chotto puts Mr Khan in the heart of Afghanistan's poppy culture and just beyond the reach of the Pakistani authorities. The border province of Helmand provided more than half the estimated 3,300 tonnes of opium derived from Afghanistan's poppy crop last year. Close to his estate are 100 small mud-hut laboratories which refine opium to 70% pure heroin. Drug production is one of the many reasons why international lenders and aid donors have tended to shun the Taliban Taliban militia which governs Afghanistan. Trying to improve its image, the regime has banned poppy farming - officially, at least - and reports indicate that this season some farmers have turned to other crops. But drugs squad officers say the Taliban, who reaps lucrative taxes from the opium crop, have large stocks of drugs which traffickers will continue to smuggle to the west for many years. Mr Khan, like other smugglers, has teams of heavily armed drug runners who can reach the Iranian border or the Arabian Sea on the Pakistani coast within four days. They drive only at night, in new pickups loaded with opium, morphine, heroin and hashish, and equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns and Kalashnikov assault rifles. The drivers rely on night-vision goggles and communicate with the rest of the convoy on secure high-frequency radios. In return for the risk a driver is paid 3,000 rupees (\u00a335) for a night's work and a gunman 1,000 rupees.

Anyone caught carrying more than 1kg of drugs faces an automatic life sentence or death. The smugglers rarely surrender when confronted. But the ANF cannot hope to stop every convoy. Last year the ANF says it seized 3.8 tonnes of heroin and morphine, 4.3 tonnes of raw opium and 18.8 tonnes of hashish in Baluchistan province, which borders Afghanistan. The total figure was a record, but many thousands of tonnes got through, nevertheless. The official figures for drug seizures in similar operations across the border in Iran are slightly lower but are reported to have exacted a far higher cost. More than 3,000 Iranian police officers and soldiers are said to have been killed in drug-related battles in the past 20 years. Five hours' drive up the road in Quetta some of the victims of the trade gather under a canal bridge. Pakistan has a growing population of 4m addicts, known in Urdu slang as jahaz - aeroplanes. Abdul Bari has been smoking heroin for 10 years. \"I have no job. I have to take money from my family. But it is hard to do without this,\" he said, clutching in his hand a slip of silver foil holding a small brown bead of heroin. He buys two grams a day from a local peddler, which costs him about 200 rupees (\u00a32.40). Most addicts can get enough to sustain them by begging. \"The big shots, we never see them here. We are suffering but they have made a fortune from us and we have lost everything.\" A distraught mother, her hair covered in a blue shawl, came running under the bridge. \" Where is my son? Where is Salam?\" she screamed at the addicts. \"My son was an addict and then he went to jail. Now he has come out and started again. I want him to be treated but I don't have the money. Just catch him and hand him over to the police, at least he will be free from the drugs.\"",

Tiberio Mitri, whose world title fight against Jake La Motta was immortalised in the film Raging Bull, was sliced in two after shambling towards a passenger train leaving central Rome. He failed to hear - or ignored - its warning horn and made no effort to get off the tracks. It took the police several hours on Monday to identify him as the Trieste Tiger, whose fairytale life slid into tragedy and poverty. Along with the tributes there were recriminations against senators for sitting on a bill to pay higher pensions to retired sports figures. Mitri's had been cited as an urgent case. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may have confused the 74-year-old into thinking he could board a train for what he imagined would be a triumphant homecoming to Trieste, a friend told La Repubblica. Apart from the local charity Sant'Egidio, which visited him in his tiny flat, he was largely forgotten. Beginning at 13, Mitri became Italy's best postwar boxer, and was European champion in 1949-50. Blond, blue-eyed and babyfaced, he burnished a golden image by marrying Fulvia Franco, voted Miss Italy in 1948. Technique, grit and imagination compensated for his relative lack of power, and he was chosen to fight La Motta in New York's Madison Square Garden on July 12 1950. Distracted by his wife's efforts to become a Hollywood starlet, he did not prepare properly and lost on points to the Bronx Bull after 15 rounds. \"My punches were like caresses, his were blows of mortar. Jake was too strong for me,\" he said. Nevertheless he returned home a hero and reclaimed his European title in 1954 by knocking out the Briton Randolph Turpin. He lost it the same year and retired. By then his private life was spinning out of control. A messy divorce dominated the headlines, and he tried to become a painter and an actor. Bit-parts in films led to nothing, and he turned to alcohol and heroin. Convictions for drink driving and drug possession followed. His 30-year-old son Alex died of a heroin overdose in 1981. His only other child, Fulvia, the daughter of a second marriage, died of Aids in 1986. A broken man, he propped up bars in Rome and lost touch with friends as disease ravaged his mind and body.

A spokeswoman at St James's Palace said: \"The prince will discuss a very wide range of issues, but his programme is still fairly fluid and there is no set agenda.\" Amnesty yesterday urged the prince to raise the matter. \"He is clearly representing the United Kingdom in his dealings with the Saudi authorities,\" a spokesman said. \"We hope he will use his influence and raise with his Saudi hosts issues such as torture and unfair and secretive trials, particularly in the light of the current detention of a British national.\" It is understood that the prince took advice from the Foreign Office before confirming his trip, which had been planned for some time. A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday: \"Through our ambassador Britain is taking every opportunity to raise these cases at the highest level.\" The ambassador, Derek Plumbly, met the Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, last week and consular officials were allowed to visit Mr Mitchell in jail last Sunday - a week after his televised confession.

      "bodyText": "The French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, made a flying five-hour visit to Algiers yesterday as tension between the two countries was increased by allegations that Algerian troops are as guilty of civilian atrocities as the Islamist militants they are supposed to be fighting. Mr V\u00e9drine pointedly refused to discuss the accusation, made by a former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia, in a book published in Paris last week. \"I am here to work, to feed and develop the important links between France and Algeria,\" he said before a meeting with President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The Algerian government is furious at the credence the French media and intellectuals have given to The Dirty War, a detailed and shocking account of almost a decade of alleged Algerian army involvement in the massacre of tens of thousands of innocent civilians. \"I have seen colleagues burn alive a 15-year-old child. I have seen soldiers disguising themselves as terrorists and massacring civilians,\" Mr Souaidia wrote. \"I have seen colonels kill mere suspects in cold blood. I have seen officers torture fundamentalists to death. I have seen too many things.\" A group of prominent French and north African intellectuals has seized on Mr Souaidia's account to denounce France's the kid-glove approach to the Bouteflika regime, calling it \"complicity in crimes against humanity\". \"For too long the French government has supported Algerian policy which, under cover of a fight against terrorism, aims at nothing less than the eradication, both political and physical, of any opposition whatsoever,\" the group wrote in the daily Le Monde. More than 100,000 people, most of them civilians, are estimated to have died violently in Algeria since the government, backed by the armed forces, cancelled a general election in which Muslim fundamentalists had taken a commanding lead in 1992. According to a leaked Algerian army report, 9,200 people were killed last year alone. The deaths continued last weekend, when 27 civilians - including eight women and 13 children aged from six months to 14 years - were slaughtered in Berrouaghia, a shantytown 60 miles south of Algiers. In Algeria, The Dirty War has met with outrage in the government-controlled press, which accused Mr Souaidia of being a \"common thief\" and a \"soldier turned criminal\". The former officer's family in the small eastern town of Tebessa have received threatening visits from army security officers, and his brother's video rental shop has been ransacked by unknown intruders. Mr Souaidia, a volunteer special forces parachute officer, fled Algeria to France last summer after being sentenced to four years in an army prison on theft charges which he says were trumped up. He says he witnessed many killings staged by the Algerian army to look as if they were done by fundamentalists. \"The generals want to stay in power,\" he said yesterday. \"To justify that, the war has to continue, so we can say to the international community, 'Look, these are the terrorists we are fighting against, look what they do.

Should these prove insufficient, staff will be required to clock out for further breaks. </p> <p>The approach represents a compromise, the council having previously considered banning smokers' breaks. \"We always supported the policy which prohibited smoking in the building, because of the risk of passive smoking,\" says Simon Holmes, local branch secretary of Unison, the public services union. \"But when the authority wanted to abolish smokers' breaks outside, it then became a human rights issue and we opposed it.\" </p> <p>As long as the idea is not abused by the management, Holmes says, he is happy with an initiative which is \"sympathetic\" to smokers but also ensures that lost time is made up. \"This was, understandably, the major grievance of non-smokers, who aren't inclined to take as many breaks.\" </p> <p>Smokers currently number 45 in a workforce of 300 at Amber Valley. And according to David Holmes, borough personnel and development officer, the new policy has met no opposition. \"It has set an agenda and strikes a sensible balance,\" he says. \"Consequently, smoking is no longer an issue with the staff. </p> <p>\"On average, most smokers tend to take two or three breaks a day, and the new guidelines will accommodate these. I think this is fair. And some smokers do, of course, work through these breaks. Having a cigarette does not prevent someone, for example, from reading a report.\" </p> <p>Should someone feel the need to excuse themselves five or six times, so upsetting the rhythm of the office, Holmes says he would \"obviously have a word in their ear - just as I would with anyone who made six trips to buy snacks\". </p> <p>However, not everybody is content with the fact that this policy is based, at least in part, on the premise that smokers - intentionally or not - take liberties at work. \"To my knowledge, there is no evidence that the productivity levels of smokers are any lower than those of non-smokers,\" says Juliette Torres, spokeswoman for Forest, the smokers' rights group. \"So even if they do spend less time in the office, it's irrelevant. And just how efficient would smokers be if they weren't allowed to light up?\" </p> <p>The key issues here, argues Torres, are trust and loyalty. \"A responsible and adult workforce shouldn't need to concern itself with someone nipping out for a cigarette,\" she says. \"We all have moments when we stare out of the window and daydream, or take time out for ourselves in the bathroom. It doesn't mean we're not pulling our weight. When we are refreshed, we are more productive. </p> <p>\"Trusting your colleagues in this respect means that the work ethic need not suffer. Otherwise, it could get very silly indeed. Can you imagine having to clock out before visiting the loo? Of course not. Unless smokers are abusing a system, clocking in and out seems a heavy-handed response to their habit.\" </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Amanda Sandford, of anti-smoking group Ash, insists that smoking should not be a factor in any area of modern life. \"It is out of sync with our health awareness and the improved lifestyle that goes with it,\" she says. \"As for the requirement that smokers at work clock out for their breaks, this can only be a good thing. Quite apart from the fact that they spend more time away from their desks, they also, on average, take twice as much time off work than non-smokers.\" </p> <p>That Amber Valley is also offering its staff anti-smoking aids, such as nicotine patches and chewing gum, is only to be applauded, says Sandford. \"It's a further move in the right direction, as their employer acknowledges their addiction and wants to help them to kick it,\" she says. </p> <p>Holmes insists that the authority is not putting any pressure on smokers to give up. \"But if a member of staff is thinking about giving it a go, we can be of assistance,\" he says. \"I really don't think an employer can be fairer than that.\"</p>",

But that is as far as the lesson goes in following educational convention. </p> <p>In more ways than one, this teacher-pupil relationship is topsy-turvy: five young people - aged between 17 and 20 - who have all spent a chunk of their childhood in care are giving a lesson to a group of social workers. </p> <p>Started in April last year, the group of \"teachers\", who have named themselves Yippee (young independent people presenting educational enter tainment), talk to adult professionals about their experience of fostering, custody, residential care and independent living in and around Manchester in order to influence the way they deal with future generations in care. </p> <p>So far, lessons have been given to youth workers; social work students in Cheshire, Salford and at Manchester University; teachers in Bolton and careers officers. Last year, three Yippee members went to parliament to discuss care services with ministers. </p> <p>In response to Christopher's question, one student wants to know why Kate - a 19-year-old member of Yippee who, since the age of 14, has been fostered, lived in shared accommodation and two women's refugees - has been moved so many times. \"I didn't have a close relationship with my social worker,\" she says. \"I felt that he was never there.\" </p> <p>Natalie, a 17-year-old member of the group, has been in and out of care since she was nine. She tells the class that her social worker always spent time asking about her twin when she should have been asking about her. Rosetta, who described in her presentation how she had had several foster parents and been to 21 primary schools, tells a student that she was a quiet child. \"I didn't say boo to nobody. My social worker told me to go upstairs and I listened at the top to her telling my foster parents what had happened to me.\" </p> <p>Yippee's sister group, Cats (citizens as trainers), which is made up of around 10 adults who use health, social and benefit services, shares the founding principle that each member has skills and abilities not only to offer their students, but also to each other. \"The idea is not just about the groups talking to professionals,\" says Annette Rimmer, a lecturer in social work and policy, who initiated both groups. \"Close relationships are built between members and confidence is then raised. Social services always separates people into groups, such as mental health and disability. But the groups have the shared experience of disrespect as service users.\" </p> <p>This is backed up by all members. \"People don't realise how the spoken word can wound,\" says Sue, a member of Cats, who is a health and social service user. Rosetta says she was made to feel \"like a piece of paper\" when she was in care. Brod, a Cats member and father of a disabled child, argues that if social services had to sell their services to users \"no one would buy them\". </p> <p>In the two years since Cats was formed, members have given their services to student nurses, social workers and related conferences in the north-west. Both groups are eager to be called upon from every corner of the country. </p> <p>The seeds of Cats were sown after Rimmer held a public meeting, inviting members of community organisations who were interested in forming a training group. Yippee was later set up in collaboration with Barnardo's Manchester leaving care service. Kim Harwood, of Barnardo's, and Rimmer offer backseat support, allowing members of both groups to lead themselves - a principle of self-directed group work which was developed by academics Audrey Mullender and David Ward, of De Montfort University, Leicester. </p> <p>Funded by Salford University's faculty of community, social and healthcare, Barnardo's and by donations from training sessions, both groups meet weekly to plan sessions and discuss group policy. </p> <p>Chris, a Cats member and mother of two, who uses both social and health services, had been home-bound and felt useless before she joined the group. \"Not because of my disability but because I didn't know how to be useful,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Life experience is our only training. There's a lot of financial strain on services, but improving a service is not always about money. Sometimes it's about a different approach.\" </p> <p>Students leaving the Yippee session agree. One says: \"We work within the care service but we haven't lived it.\" Adds another: \"They can be honest about what happened and we found out that they don't feel listened to.\" \"There are barriers that are not broken down.\" </p> <p>Not all students who have been \"taught\" by Yippee and Cats are so accepting of the role reversal. Despite both groups championing the positive as well as highlighting the negative aspects of the services they receive, some professionals have clearly felt unhappy playing student to people they are used to being in charge of. One teacher became annoyed during Yippee's presentation and told the group that a colleague had suffered a nervous breakdown resulting from the stress of the job. </p> <p>Rimmer says that because of some resistance from professionals, group members never give sessions alone. \"Some people have been teaching or in social work for a long time and they feel uncomfortable having the power relationship turned around,\" she says. \"Students are forced for the first time to confront their own attitudes to people they provide a service to. They're no different from other lecturers but some people do think they know it all.\" </p> <p>\"We don't want the students to go away with any negative reactions,\" Brod says. \"There is good practice out there.\" </p> <p>Aware of how some professionals feel, Natalie says that she avoids saying \"you\" accusatively when she gives a presentation. But she doubts that all her students will take what the group says to heart. She says: \"We edit our lives down because there are some things you just can't tell strangers.\" </p> <p>But she adds that even if it has no impact on some students, it benefits her. \"It's like a form of therapy,\" she says. \"We're having to live in the past. I'm shaking every time I do it. For most of us, it's the first time we've talked about what happened to us.\" </p> <p>More information about Yippee can be found at <a href=\"http://www.Yippee-group.org\">www.Yippee-group.org</a> or contact Kim Harwood on 0161- 226 6722.

But that is as far as the lesson goes in following educational convention. </p> <p>In more ways than one, this teacher-pupil relationship is topsy-turvy: five young people - aged between 17 and 20 - who have all spent a chunk of their childhood in care are giving a lesson to a group of social workers. </p> <p>Started in April last year, the group of \"teachers\", who have named themselves Yippee (young independent people presenting educational enter tainment), talk to adult professionals about their experience of fostering, custody, residential care and independent living in and around Manchester in order to influence the way they deal with future generations in care. </p> <p>So far, lessons have been given to youth workers; social work students in Cheshire, Salford and at Manchester University; teachers in Bolton and careers officers. Last year, three Yippee members went to parliament to discuss care services with ministers. </p> <p>In response to Christopher's question, one student wants to know why Kate - a 19-year-old member of Yippee who, since the age of 14, has been fostered, lived in shared accommodation and two women's refugees - has been moved so many times. \"I didn't have a close relationship with my social worker,\" she says. \"I felt that he was never there.\" </p> <p>Natalie, a 17-year-old member of the group, has been in and out of care since she was nine. She tells the class that her social worker always spent time asking about her twin when she should have been asking about her. Rosetta, who described in her presentation how she had had several foster parents and been to 21 primary schools, tells a student that she was a quiet child. \"I didn't say boo to nobody. My social worker told me to go upstairs and I listened at the top to her telling my foster parents what had happened to me.\" </p> <p>Yippee's sister group, Cats (citizens as trainers), which is made up of around 10 adults who use health, social and benefit services, shares the founding principle that each member has skills and abilities not only to offer their students, but also to each other. \"The idea is not just about the groups talking to professionals,\" says Annette Rimmer, a lecturer in social work and policy, who initiated both groups. \"Close relationships are built between members and confidence is then raised. Social services always separates people into groups, such as mental health and disability. But the groups have the shared experience of disrespect as service users.\" </p> <p>This is backed up by all members. \"People don't realise how the spoken word can wound,\" says Sue, a member of Cats, who is a health and social service user. Rosetta says she was made to feel \"like a piece of paper\" when she was in care. Brod, a Cats member and father of a disabled child, argues that if social services had to sell their services to users \"no one would buy them\". </p> <p>In the two years since Cats was formed, members have given their services to student nurses, social workers and related conferences in the north-west. Both groups are eager to be called upon from every corner of the country. </p> <p>The seeds of Cats were sown after Rimmer held a public meeting, inviting members of community organisations who were interested in forming a training group. Yippee was later set up in collaboration with Barnardo's Manchester leaving care service. Kim Harwood, of Barnardo's, and Rimmer offer backseat support, allowing members of both groups to lead themselves - a principle of self-directed group work which was developed by academics Audrey Mullender and David Ward, of De Montfort University, Leicester. </p> <p>Funded by Salford University's faculty of community, social and healthcare, Barnardo's and by donations from training sessions, both groups meet weekly to plan sessions and discuss group policy. </p> <p>Chris, a Cats member and mother of two, who uses both social and health services, had been home-bound and felt useless before she joined the group. \"Not because of my disability but because I didn't know how to be useful,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Life experience is our only training. There's a lot of financial strain on services, but improving a service is not always about money. Sometimes it's about a different approach.\" </p> <p>Students leaving the Yippee session agree. One says: \"We work within the care service but we haven't lived it.\" Adds another: \"They can be honest about what happened and we found out that they don't feel listened to.\" \"There are barriers that are not broken down.\" </p> <p>Not all students who have been \"taught\" by Yippee and Cats are so accepting of the role reversal. Despite both groups championing the positive as well as highlighting the negative aspects of the services they receive, some professionals have clearly felt unhappy playing student to people they are used to being in charge of. One teacher became annoyed during Yippee's presentation and told the group that a colleague had suffered a nervous breakdown resulting from the stress of the job. </p> <p>Rimmer says that because of some resistance from professionals, group members never give sessions alone. \"Some people have been teaching or in social work for a long time and they feel uncomfortable having the power relationship turned around,\" she says. \"Students are forced for the first time to confront their own attitudes to people they provide a service to.

It is now reliant on the goodwill of a handful of volunteers, including Thompson's wife, Janice, also a former world karate gold medallist. </p> <p>If the government thinks Thompson is such a hero, why has it neither funded his organisation nor consulted him on how to tackle youth crime? Last summer, Tony Blair appointed former BBC director general Lord Birt as his adviser on \"yob culture\" - a post Thompson's journey from the streets to the victor's rostrum would arguably have better equipped him to hold. </p> <p>\"I was a young, insecure black male who was bullied at my school in Hackney for having a Wolverhampton accent,\" he says. \"Stressed teachers, overcrowded classrooms, underachieving pupils, gangs of youths pinning teachers against the wall - none of this is new.

I know about the power of sport to motivate, engage and interest young people, the discipline, self-esteem and confidence it instills.\" </p> <p>Thompson, now 43, talks with a passion usually reserved for the pulpit, and it comes as no surprise to learn that his intensity of purpose comes from a strong spiritual belief. But while it inspires young people from the inner cities who have heard him speak, he fears his approach is met with suspicion by some in authority who view him as a loose cannon. Perhaps that is why he was passed over last year as chair of Sport England, an organisation he first joined in 1988, when it was then called the Sports Council. </p> <p>Winning five gold medals opened doors for Thompson. In 1988, he was part of an influential body of sportsmen, academics, business leaders and politicians which drew up a report arguing that sport could keep teenagers out of trouble.

But the fact that its programme has been adopted in 16 countries, and counts Sydney Olympics 200 metres silver medallist Darren Campbell among its success stories, is testimony that it is doing something right. </p> <p>Thompson has spent three years struggling to raise \u00a34m to open a social centre of excellence for young people in Toxteth, Liverpool.

The findings are driven home by the charity today in a video manifesto, seeking to ensure that the political parties take on board issues concerning older people. </p> <p>The video, entitled Dignity, Security, Opportunity, is one of the first such manifestos produced by a voluntary organisation. It features a seven-year-old schoolgirl, Ann Tivey, from Oxfordshire, who says: \"It's not just the old people who should be thinking about this. I'm worried about what's going to happen to me when I get to be as old as my nana, unless someone does something now to make things better.\" </p> <p>She appears alongside pensioners who share their experiences of ageism and poor public services and set out five priorities for the election. These are: ending pensioner poverty; outlawing discrimination against older people; banning ageism in the NHS and public services; abolishing charges for those who need long-term care; and investing in cheap and reliable public transport to prevent the isolation that many older people suffer. Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England, says: \"As Ann points out in our video, more of us than ever before will live to a ripe old age. What lies in store in later life for our children starts with today's politicians. </p> <p>\"The decisions made at this general election will determine whether today's and tomorrow's older people will live in poverty or independence, in sickness or in health, on the margins of society or at its centre, as a resented burden on the state or as equal members of society.\" </p> <p>The charity's poll was carried out among 2,000 people of all ages in January and earlier this month. It suggests that some 6m people aged over 60 have not decided which political party to vote for. \"For years, older voters have been taken for granted by the parties as having fixed voting intentions,\" says Lishman. \"This is no longer true.\" </p> <p>When compared to the results of an identical poll in January 1997, ahead of the general election that May, the findings also indicate that turnout by voters of all ages may fall by as much as 7%. The new poll predicts that the turnout will be 64 to 67%, compared to 71% four years ago. However, the falling interest is entirely among younger and middle-age groups. The num ber of older people intending to vote remains identical. </p> <p>The charity's manifesto says the most effective way to attack pensioner poverty is by providing a basic pension of at least \u00a390 a week for a single pensioner and \u00a3135 for a couple, plus necessary housing costs, uprated each year. It claims that this would reduce greatly the need for reliance on means-tested benefits that are plagued by low take-up and prevent older people with modest incomes from saving or working in retirement without losing out. </p> <p>Age Concern criticises the government's plan to introduce a pension credit from April 2003. This will add additional complexity, it says, and threatens to leave older people on modest incomes still contemplating a much higher withdrawal of income than that faced by most taxpayers. </p> <p>The video also calls for a health, housing and care system which offers independence and security for all, and new opportunities for older people to work, volunteer, learn and retrain. It is accompanied by a traditional written manifesto and will be shown to audiences in town squares across the country as part of Age Concern's general election roadshow.</p>",

It suggests that some 6m people aged over 60 have not decided which political party to vote for. \"For years, older voters have been taken for granted by the parties as having fixed voting intentions,\" says Lishman. \"This is no longer true.\" When compared to the results of an identical poll in January 1997, ahead of the general election that May, the findings also indicate that turnout by voters of all ages may fall by as much as 7%. The new poll predicts that the turnout will be 64 to 67%, compared to 71% four years ago. However, the falling interest is entirely among younger and middle-age groups. The num ber of older people intending to vote remains identical. The charity's manifesto says the most effective way to attack pensioner poverty is by providing a basic pension of at least \u00a390 a week for a single pensioner and \u00a3135 for a couple, plus necessary housing costs, uprated each year. It claims that this would reduce greatly the need for reliance on means-tested benefits that are plagued by low take-up and prevent older people with modest incomes from saving or working in retirement without losing out. Age Concern criticises the government's plan to introduce a pension credit from April 2003. This will add additional complexity, it says, and threatens to leave older people on modest incomes still contemplating a much higher withdrawal of income than that faced by most taxpayers. The video also calls for a health, housing and care system which offers independence and security for all, and new opportunities for older people to work, volunteer, learn and retrain. It is accompanied by a traditional written manifesto and will be shown to audiences in town squares across the country as part of Age Concern's general election roadshow.",

      "body": "<p>On the morning my four-year-old daughter was discharged from the hospital in Paris, where she had been staying for 10 days with a broken leg, they gave us a wheelchair to test drive. You'll be needing one of these at home, they said. We spent the morning navigating the corridors of the ward, unaware of the scale of problems that lay ahead. </p> <p>I was beginning to get worried, though. By then, I had already spent several days trying to organise a wheelchair in London for Ella's return. We had been told that Ella would have to lie more or less flat for at least six weeks. She was encased in plaster all the way down one leg from her waist, was helpless and was as stiff as a board. </p> <p>First, I had called our GP's surgery, which advised me to call the Red Cross and the nearest NHS wheelchair clinic. My mother was also on the case, but our calls had so far turned up nothing. The Red Cross had nothing suitable for a child and, apparently, there would be no NHS wheelchair clinic at the Parkside clinic - our nearest centre, in Southall, west London - for at least two weeks. They would send us a referral form in the meantime. </p> <p>The GP's surgery then suggested social services. But everywhere we turned it was the same story. Finally, the local occupational therapy department spelled it out. \"Funny thing, wheelchairs - they are in a sort of no man's land,\" we were told. \"We can arrange them for permanent use, but not short-term. Try physiotherapy at the hospital.\" </p> <p>So, we tried physiotherapy at Ealing hospital, as well as the children's disabilities unit, the paediatric ward, the fracture clinic and St John Ambulance. It felt like being stuck in revolving doors. Have you tried the wheelchair clinic? Tried the Red Cross? And sometimes the answers were strange: \"Perhaps you can buy one at the mobility shop.\" Or: \"Have you tried Boots?\" </p> <p>On the day we arrived back in London, we went to see the GP and sat with Ella lying rigid across us in the waiting room. It was obvious that we urgently needed a wheelchair, the doctor said, and Ealing hospital had failed to come up with one because we were not yet registered there. We got a letter for the fracture clinic, requesting a wheelchair and explaining our situation. The GP's secretary would ring the clinic in the morning, find out how to proceed and then call us. </p> <p>Receiving no call, we rang the secretary, who suggested we \"get down to casualty and take it from there\". It seemed a sure way of getting a wheelchair - sitting in A&amp;E with Ella's rigid body lying across the seats.But after she had been registered and her x-rays seen by the consultant, the nurse told us it was not going to happen. \"If the accident had happened here,\" she said, \"the hospital would have sorted it out.\" </p> <p>My husband was going away the next day and I don't drive. I began to panic. Without a car, the only way to carry Ella was in my arms. Surely the hospital could find a wheelchair for an immobile four-year-old. So I declared: \"I am not leaving this hospital without a wheelchair.\" </p> <p>Several nurses tried to help us. \"Have you thought of a pram with a plank across it?\" one suggested. Again, though, we were told that there would be no wheelchair clinic for two weeks.</p> <p> We waited most of the afternoon for the hospital's senior physiotherapist to come out of a meeting. She was unable to help; there were only two wheelchairs in the hospital (which serves a borough of 1m people) for the weekend, but she would call the wheelchair clinic and try to speed up our referral. Finally, we were offered a baby buggy so low and narrow that Ella would have had to lie with her arms clamped to her sides and her cast sticking up in the air. We left empty-handed - except, of course, for Ella. </p> <p>About 10 days later, we received a second copy of the wheelchair clinic's referral form. I rang and was told that our request had been passed to the short-term loan unit in Willesden - the other side of Ealing from Southall. Did I want the number? By this stage, however, I had more or less given up on getting a wheelchair from our local services and we had grown accustomed either to carrying Ella in our arms or improvising with a borrowed buggy that had been made abroad and had an unusually sturdy frame. </p> <p>Rita Moloney, office manager of the Parkside wheelchair clinic in Southall told me later that the clinic always \"moves heaven and earth for children\" and that, had we taken Ella to any of Parkside's other three sites in west London immediately on our return from France, we would have left the same day with a chair. </p> <p>But how were we supposed to know this if our GP, social services, the hospital and even the clinic's own staff were unaware of it? </p> <p>Moloney says we were misinformed. The Red Cross supplies short-term wheelchairs to adults, but rarely has chairs for children. The Parkside wheelchair clinic was set up in part to meet that need. </p> <p>In Ella's case, it did not.</p>",

Eighty would live in sub-standard housing, 70 would be unable to read and 50 would suffer malnutrition. Six would possess 59% of the world's wealth and all of them would be from the US. Only one would own a computer. If you can read this message you are more blessed than the two billion in the world who cannot.\" Very cheering.</p> <p><strong> Battle of Brittan</strong><br> </p> <p>Trade secretary Stephen Byers, who last year underwrote \u00a31.5bn worth of military exports, many to Indonesia, Turkey and other regimes with dubious human rights records, has been invited to a lecture on April 9 by that pillar of economic rectitude, Sir Samuel Brittan. Both the theme and the message may surprise him. Organised by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, the title is Subsidising a Deadly Trade, the economics of government support for arms exports. Brittan, a Financial Times columnist knighted by John Major, takes a tough line on government feather-bedding of the \"defence\" business. He has written that subsidies are lousy value for money because \"arms sales do not represent, even in the narrowest economic terms, the best use of national resources\". Let us hope Byers is listening carefully.</p> <p><strong> Who's afraid of . . .</strong><br> </p> <p> Norway, which has just blotted its environmental record by allowing the resumption of international trade in whale products, is now intent on wiping out half its wolf population. Wolves are said to be killing a tiny number of sheep in one of the richest countries in the world - yet there are only believed to be 40 wolves in the whole of Norway. Killing the wolves will cost \u00a3600,000. Norway would do better compensating the farmers at \u00a31,000 a sheep.</p> <p><strong> Secrett success</strong><br> </p> <p> Tony Juniper, campaigns and policy director of Friends of the Earth, is to succeed executive director Charles Secrett when he quits after 10 years' service in 2003. A measure of Juniper's success is that the Labour government regard him as \"unhelpful\" - that is, he hits them where it hurts.</p>",

Eighty would live in sub-standard housing, 70 would be unable to read and 50 would suffer malnutrition. Six would possess 59% of the world's wealth and all of them would be from the US. Only one would own a computer. If you can read this message you are more blessed than the two billion in the world who cannot.\" Very cheering. Battle of Brittan Trade secretary Stephen Byers, who last year underwrote \u00a31.5bn worth of military exports, many to Indonesia, Turkey and other regimes with dubious human rights records, has been invited to a lecture on April 9 by that pillar of economic rectitude, Sir Samuel Brittan. Both the theme and the message may surprise him. Organised by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, the title is Subsidising a Deadly Trade, the economics of government support for arms exports. Brittan, a Financial Times columnist knighted by John Major, takes a tough line on government feather-bedding of the \"defence\" business. He has written that subsidies are lousy value for money because \"arms sales do not represent, even in the narrowest economic terms, the best use of national resources\". Let us hope Byers is listening carefully. Who's afraid of . . . Norway, which has just blotted its environmental record by allowing the resumption of international trade in whale products, is now intent on wiping out half its wolf population. Wolves are said to be killing a tiny number of sheep in one of the richest countries in the world - yet there are only believed to be 40 wolves in the whole of Norway. Killing the wolves will cost \u00a3600,000. Norway would do better compensating the farmers at \u00a31,000 a sheep. Secrett success Tony Juniper, campaigns and policy director of Friends of the Earth, is to succeed executive director Charles Secrett when he quits after 10 years' service in 2003. A measure of Juniper's success is that the Labour government regard him as \"unhelpful\" - that is, he hits them where it hurts.",

      "body": "<p>Rio Tinto, the world's largest mining company, has been asked to prove its green credentials by abandoning plans to open a new uranium mine on a world heritage site in the Northern Territory of Australia. The company, which for years has been many environmental groups' most reviled company, has spent the last five years trying to improve its image and, at black spots around the world, clean up both its pollution and human rights record. </p> <p>Accidently, so the company claims, by taking over an Australian mining company, it has become enmeshed in one of the fiercest environmental struggles in Australian history. </p> <p>The Jabiluka mine is in the homeland of the Mirrar aboriginal people. The uranium lies under the Kakadu national park and is set to provide fuel for Britain's nuclear reactors. Even before Rio Tinto came along, a number of court cases had already been fought and lost in a bid to protect the Mirrar people's homeland and the park, and there had been hundreds of arrests in demonstrations. </p> <p>Rio Tinto acquired Jabiluka, and a nearby existing uranium mine called Ranger, in July last year when it took over the Australian conglomerate North Mining Ltd. The Ranger mine supplies fuel both for British Nuclear Fuel's Magnox reactors and British Energy's eight advanced gas cooled reactors, but is now nearing exhaustion. Under North's original plans, the Jabiluka mine was expected to start production to fill the gap. </p> <p>But for London-based Rio Tinto, opening Jabiluka would be a public relations disaster. Among the projects that blackened Rio Tinto's name in the 1970s and 80s was the operation of the uranium mine in Namibia - in cooperation with the South African regime- to supply uranium for Britain's nuclear weapons programme. </p> <p>Although the company still operates the Namibian mine on a smaller scale, it claims that uranium is no longer part of its core business. The acquisition of both the Australian mines was a by-product of a much larger takeover of North's iron ore business and, although the takeover was last summer, no decision has yet been reached about the future of the two mines. </p> <p>Last week, Rio Tinto, which has its world headquarters in London, announced profits of $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn), 25% up on the previous year. The chairman, Sir Robert Wilson, said it had been a particularly active year, mentioning the acquisition of extra coal, iron and diamond interests. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth (FOE), which is mounting an international campaign to get Rio Tinto to close both mines in Australia, said a company with so much money could make a one-off gesture by closing the Ranger mine and giving back the Jabiluka land to the Mirrar people. </p> <p>FOE fears that, to avoid the adverse publicity when it opens the mine, Rio Tinto may sell Jabiluka on to the French nuclear giant Cogema. Although there is a world surplus of uranium and, according to Rio Tinto's own annual report, prices have slumped to an all-time low, Cogema could use Jabiluka to safeguard its own uranium supplies for more than 40 French reactors, as well as export the surplus to the UK. </p> <p>The Ranger and Jabiluka mines are both inside the Kakadu national park made famous by the Crocodile Dundee films and declared a world heritage site. It is the home of 2.5m water birds, almost 1,000 different plant species and attracts 250,000 tourists a year. </p> <p>The Mirrar people regard this as their ancestral home and point to the damage done over years by the Ranger mine, which has left 20m tonnes of radioactive tailings in spoil heaps around its operations. According to FOE, there have been 120 breaches of the mine's operational guidelines under North's ownership - most recently in May last year, when there was a leak of 2m gallons of radioactive liquid contaminated with manganese, uranium and radium. Some of this escaped into the Kakadu wetlands. </p> <p>An investigation by the Australian senate criticised the government for not conducting a social impact study of the Jabiluka project to see what effect it would have on the Mirrar people and found the circumstances surrounding the 1982 mining agreement with the local people was deeply unfair and that the mine should not proceed. The Mirrar people now repudiate the 1982 agreement, saying that they were misinformed about their rights, but the government disagreed and said the mine could go ahead. Construction was completed by North Mining before the takeover, but no uranium has yet been mined. </p> <p>Ed Matthew, from FOE in London, says: \"This mine is on land unjustly wrested from the Aboriginal people and inside a World Heritage site. If Rio Tinto proceed with this mine it will be telling us that there is no place on earth the company is not prepared to plunder. They are a hugely rich company, and they could well afford to make a generous gesture which will show the world they care. </p> <p>\"If Rio Tinto sells the mining leases to another mining company they are condemning the Mirrar people to another 30 years of social chaos. This is a key test of Rio Tinto's claims to respect the environment and support sustainable development. The company's reputation will be soiled for ever if this goes ahead.\" </p> <p>Rio Tinto say that the three options were to operate Jabiluka, close it or sell it, but no decision has yet been reached. </p> <p>British Nuclear Fuels said Australia was just one of a number of sources of supply of uranium, and that Jabiluka was not essential. There were also mines in Canada, South Africa and Russia. </p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto's troubled record</strong></p> <p><strong> Madagascar:</strong> Plans for a titanium dioxide mine on the south-east coast of Madagascar generated international condemnation following the death from a heart attack of Andrew Lees, former campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth, while investigating the project in 1995. Despite this Rio Tinto are considering forging ahead which FOE says could destroy up to 76% of a unique forest ecosystem. The project also threatens to pollute the local water supply, to destroy its fishing industry and to endanger over 500 species. Titanium dioxide is a mineral used to manufacture a white pigment that is commonly used in paper, paint and plastics.

      "body": "<p>Geoff Thompson is just the sort of person the government has in mind to act as neighbourhood champions in deprived areas, under its commitment to neighbourhood renewal. The hope is that these champions will provide a link between local people and the array of statutory and voluntary organisations delivering services and pumping in funding to the 88 poorest areas. </p> <p>Thompson, five times world karate champion, and founder of Youth Charter for Sport (YCS) in Moss Side, Manchester, should be pleased that his work is being held up as a model. But he is concerned that the endorsement is little more than lip service from a government he sees as full of fine words and policies, but lacking any real commitment to changing the lives of disadvantaged young people. </p> <p>It's easy to see why he's formed that view. Last week, YCS almost shut up shop after seven years, when the little voluntary sector and corporate funding that it had dried up.

      "bodyText": "Geoff Thompson is just the sort of person the government has in mind to act as neighbourhood champions in deprived areas, under its commitment to neighbourhood renewal. The hope is that these champions will provide a link between local people and the array of statutory and voluntary organisations delivering services and pumping in funding to the 88 poorest areas. Thompson, five times world karate champion, and founder of Youth Charter for Sport (YCS) in Moss Side, Manchester, should be pleased that his work is being held up as a model. But he is concerned that the endorsement is little more than lip service from a government he sees as full of fine words and policies, but lacking any real commitment to changing the lives of disadvantaged young people. It's easy to see why he's formed that view. Last week, YCS almost shut up shop after seven years, when the little voluntary sector and corporate funding that it had dried up. It is now reliant on the goodwill of a handful of volunteers, including Thompson's wife, Janice, also a former world karate gold medallist. If the government thinks Thompson is such a hero, why has it neither funded his organisation nor consulted him on how to tackle youth crime?

      "body": "<p>Great opera houses around the world seek the services of talented director Graham Vick. His name is known from Covent Garden to the Metropolitan, New York, from the Vienna State to Glyndebourne, from La Scala, Milan, to Ladywood. </p> <p>Yes, that's Ladywood, Birmingham. Geographically, it borders Brindleyplace, with its expensive canalside restaurants and sumptuous Symphony Hall. Socially and economically, it might be on a different planet, an inner-city area scarred by all the problems associated with that term. </p> <p>Within this area, the Warehouse stands shabbily in a back street, bordered by low-rise and high-rise social housing. Breeze blocks and wooden boards make up most of the exterior. A peeling sign proclaims this building to be a council depot. </p> <p>Perched somewhere in the scaffolding which runs right round the building's vast interior, a soprano and baritone are letting rip. Down at ground level, Vick listens intently. At 47, he is grey-haired and bespectacled. But an outwardly benign and kindly air masks a passionate belief that opera must appeal to every race and every strata of society, rather than to an overwhelmingly pink-skinned, dinner-jacketed and bejewelled elite. </p> <p>He has been artistic director of the City of Birmingham Touring Opera since 1987, but recently relaunched it as the Birmingham Opera Company, with a commitment to perform in uncompromisingly urban settings. A marked contrast, this, with the ever-growing number of summer-evening picnic operas in the grounds of big country houses. The son of a credit draper from the docklands area of Liverpool, Vick claims he was \"re-politicised\" by his nine years at Glyndebourne and views the country-house trend as an extension of opera as a privileged and exclusive club. </p> <p>The Ladywood warehouse is not just a rehearsal space. It is where Vick plans to stage Alban Berg's 1920s opera, Votzec, in modern dress and in English. Nine professional singers and 21 members of the orchestra will be joined by amateur actors and dancers drawn from such diverse organisations as the Yehlehleh young Asian theatre company, a gay men's performance group and members of Gallery 37 - hitherto unemployed youngsters who are doing apprenticeships in the creative arts. </p> <p>They will also be joined by the audience as the whole show is to be done in promenade. No plush seats here; indeed, no seats at all beyond a few plastic chairs and a park bench, to which Vick repairs at 5.30pm when he declares a brief break from rehearsals. When it is pointed out that this is a rum venue for an opera, he looks pleased. \"Good, good, good,\" he says. \"What I wanted to do was to take the notion of inclusiveness and make it central to the company's work. I wanted to take people by surprise. That's partly to do with where it's set and partly to do with the subject matter. This is a piece that speaks to me of this part of Birmingham.\" </p> <p>But wasn't Berg an Austrian? \"Yes, but the issues are very contemporary - single parenthood, prostitution, teenage pregnancy, the dispossessed and how they survive,\" Vick explains. \"And all this is set in a harsh, uncaring society with no compassion.\" </p> <p>In Vick's view, New Labour has changed little in nearly four years. \"We still have a 1980s society with an ostensibly warm and cuddly government,\" he says. \"They talk about opportunities for everybody, but what they're really saying is that 'you, too, can join the elite'. Covent Garden has the lowest subsidies and the highest ticket prices in the world, which is symptomatic of our society. How can we change that as long as the majority of the population sees opera as a plaything of the rich? </p> <p>\"Surveys have shown that the biggest single thing putting people off is the existing audience. My generation worked hard to change that perception, but all that was thrown away in the mid to late 1980s, when there was a return to glamour in the way opera was sold and marketed. My aim is still to help opera to put down roots in British culture. I'm not saying that everybody should like it, any more than everybody should like football, but I do long for its value to be acknowledged by the people it doesn't reach now.\" </p> <p>And what is that value? \"It's the same for people round here as it is for the rich,\" he says. \"Opera nourishes the spirit and extends human experience. That said, the issue is how do we get people round here to come. The very fact that such an event is happening in Ladywood should attract some local interest, if only curiosity.\" </p> <p>Tickets are \u00a310, with half price for concessions. And if Ladywood does not turn out in great numbers, Vick is hopeful that the nigh-on 200 cast members from communities around Birmingham will attract their parents, sisters, cousins and aunts. \"My hope is that they'll bring an audience with them,\" he says. </p> <p>By now it is 6.30pm and the community groups are arriving for rehearsals.

      "bodyText": "Great opera houses around the world seek the services of talented director Graham Vick. His name is known from Covent Garden to the Metropolitan, New York, from the Vienna State to Glyndebourne, from La Scala, Milan, to Ladywood. Yes, that's Ladywood, Birmingham. Geographically, it borders Brindleyplace, with its expensive canalside restaurants and sumptuous Symphony Hall. Socially and economically, it might be on a different planet, an inner-city area scarred by all the problems associated with that term. Within this area, the Warehouse stands shabbily in a back street, bordered by low-rise and high-rise social housing. Breeze blocks and wooden boards make up most of the exterior. A peeling sign proclaims this building to be a council depot. Perched somewhere in the scaffolding which runs right round the building's vast interior, a soprano and baritone are letting rip. Down at ground level, Vick listens intently. At 47, he is grey-haired and bespectacled. But an outwardly benign and kindly air masks a passionate belief that opera must appeal to every race and every strata of society, rather than to an overwhelmingly pink-skinned, dinner-jacketed and bejewelled elite. He has been artistic director of the City of Birmingham Touring Opera since 1987, but recently relaunched it as the Birmingham Opera Company, with a commitment to perform in uncompromisingly urban settings. A marked contrast, this, with the ever-growing number of summer-evening picnic operas in the grounds of big country houses. The son of a credit draper from the docklands area of Liverpool, Vick claims he was \"re-politicised\" by his nine years at Glyndebourne and views the country-house trend as an extension of opera as a privileged and exclusive club. The Ladywood warehouse is not just a rehearsal space. It is where Vick plans to stage Alban Berg's 1920s opera, Votzec, in modern dress and in English. Nine professional singers and 21 members of the orchestra will be joined by amateur actors and dancers drawn from such diverse organisations as the Yehlehleh young Asian theatre company, a gay men's performance group and members of Gallery 37 - hitherto unemployed youngsters who are doing apprenticeships in the creative arts. They will also be joined by the audience as the whole show is to be done in promenade. No plush seats here; indeed, no seats at all beyond a few plastic chairs and a park bench, to which Vick repairs at 5.30pm when he declares a brief break from rehearsals. When it is pointed out that this is a rum venue for an opera, he looks pleased. \"Good, good, good,\" he says. \"What I wanted to do was to take the notion of inclusiveness and make it central to the company's work. I wanted to take people by surprise. That's partly to do with where it's set and partly to do with the subject matter. This is a piece that speaks to me of this part of Birmingham.\" But wasn't Berg an Austrian? \"Yes, but the issues are very contemporary - single parenthood, prostitution, teenage pregnancy, the dispossessed and how they survive,\" Vick explains. \"And all this is set in a harsh, uncaring society with no compassion.\" In Vick's view, New Labour has changed little in nearly four years. \"We still have a 1980s society with an ostensibly warm and cuddly government,\" he says. \"They talk about opportunities for everybody, but what they're really saying is that 'you, too, can join the elite'. Covent Garden has the lowest subsidies and the highest ticket prices in the world, which is symptomatic of our society. How can we change that as long as the majority of the population sees opera as a plaything of the rich? \"Surveys have shown that the biggest single thing putting people off is the existing audience. My generation worked hard to change that perception, but all that was thrown away in the mid to late 1980s, when there was a return to glamour in the way opera was sold and marketed. My aim is still to help opera to put down roots in British culture. I'm not saying that everybody should like it, any more than everybody should like football, but I do long for its value to be acknowledged by the people it doesn't reach now.\" And what is that value? \"It's the same for people round here as it is for the rich,\" he says. \"Opera nourishes the spirit and extends human experience. That said, the issue is how do we get people round here to come. The very fact that such an event is happening in Ladywood should attract some local interest, if only curiosity.\" Tickets are \u00a310, with half price for concessions. And if Ladywood does not turn out in great numbers, Vick is hopeful that the nigh-on 200 cast members from communities around Birmingham will attract their parents, sisters, cousins and aunts. \"My hope is that they'll bring an audience with them,\" he says. By now it is 6.30pm and the community groups are arriving for rehearsals. Choreographer Ron Howell puts them through a series of warm-up exercises. \"We have to find a way of welcoming more people from ethnic minorities into opera,\" says Vick, looking on and beaming with approval at the number of black and brown faces on the floor. He is less happy that he won't be able to go with this vibrant, multi-racial company to its next venue - in a disused aircraft hangar in his home town of Liverpool. \"I'm going to have to be in Paris,\" he says. And he sounds almost gloomy at the prospect. From hip-hop to arias Judging by the comments of some of the amateur performers from Birmingham who have joined his company for this production, director Graham Vick has some way to go to convince black youngsters about the value of opera. But at least they have open minds. \"We had a trip from college to an opera and I fell asleep,\" admits Ajay Dattani, from Handsworth. \"But I agreed to come and see what this was all about, and it's OK.

Which possibly explains one of the most unlikely relationships in recent NHS history, between current health minister Lord Hunt and former Conservative health secretary Virginia Bottomley. Like all the best romances, their - strictly platonic - meeting of minds in the mid 1990s was illicit, disapproved of by their respective \"families\", conducted by necessity outside of the public gaze and tragically doomed to fail. Lord Hunt of Kings Heath was then plain Mr Hunt: an ambitious, technocratic NHS manager who had married into a respected provincial Labour family - his mother-in-law is Theresa Stewart, former leader of Birmingham city council. Mrs Bottomley, from grander metropolitan stock, was on the \"wet\" wing of the Tory party, an NHS enthusiast who had been sent by John Major to rescue it from the loonier privatisation fantasies of the free-market right. Ordinarily, the pair might have little in common. But at times of extreme social crisis - this was the NHS under the Conservatives, remember - social and political differences were buried under common cause. Mr Hunt's future was uncertain. He was chief executive of Nahat - the national association of health authorities and trusts, which is now the NHS Confederation - and a known Labour supporter at the head of an organisation dominated by aggressively Tory trust chairmen, many of them of a distinctly Thatcherite bent. Mrs Bottomley also had a problem with the trust chairmen, some of whose public policy suggestions, such as floating Guy's hospital trust on the stock market and sending mock \"invoices\" to patients who fail to turn up for appointments, were proving embarrassing to the post-Thatcher government. And so the odd couple got it together. Behind the scenes, he would advise her candidly on which Tory policy initiatives would go down well with the NHS. She could help rein in the trust chairmen, who yearned for a Nahat chief executive who wasn't a card-carrying member of the despised Labour Party. A beautiful relationship bloomed.

By mid-1999 he was health minister, and publicly repudiating the criticisms of Mrs Bottomley and her colleagues. By now she was reduced to a mere hard-working backbencher, and he rose to on-message ministerial status, and ended up orbiting in a far grander political universe. Though their paths may meet in Westminster from time to time, it is clear the spark that was drew them together has now gone. As one source close to the pair told Health Service Journal in 1999: \"He (Philip) did have a great reputation for integrity and independence and there are those who feel he has behaved in a partisan way (as a Labour peer). \"He would never have supported waiting lists, rather than waiting times in the past.

Last year the prime minister said \"no one will be better governed through fine tuning the ministerial code\". Yet closer study of this document might have saved him much grief.</p> <p>The code used to be called Questions Of Procedure For Ministers and was first published by the Major government. Its contents go back to Clem Attlee's time, when ministers were ceasing as a matter of course to be gents who could be expected to know the rules (though Gladstone's share dealings on the back of insider knowledge were active, to put it mildly). Today's document is a compendious mix of high principle and practical advice on avoiding trouble. It is on the Cabinet Office website at <a href=\"http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/ central/1997/mcode/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/ central/1997/mcode/index.htm</a>.</p> <p>Its cardinal rule is giving parliament \"accurate and truthful information\" while - relevant in the Mandelson case - \"correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\". There are sections on gifts, ministers' private interests, lobbyists, constituency dealings: few of the Mandelson and Keith Vaz events, real or alleged, are not covered by it at least in outline. \"Ministers must scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or apparent conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests.\"</p> <p>Gifts worth up to \u00a3140 each may be kept, otherwise they have to be handed over to civil servants and sold off or \"displayed\" in a Whitehall glass case. Ministers must not use knowledge which brings \"benefit (or could arouse reasonable suspicion of this) in relation to their private financial interests\".</p> <p>Tony Wright and fellow members of the public administration committee want the code better known, perhaps aligned with the rules for other public officials and put under the supervision of a codefinder-general. It is a moot point whether ministers are schooled in their ethical obligations with sufficient rigour. Did the permanent secretary at the Trade Department thrust a copy into the hands of for example, Peter Hain on his recent transfer there? There are bound to be energy industry interests wanting to sup with him. The MPs suggest recording all lobbying episodes. If that had happened over the ministers' relationship with the Hinduja brothers there would at least be less room for disagreement about facts.</p> <p>But tinkering with the code would not address a central problem in the way we govern ourselves. The code itself relies on uncodified powers wielded by civil servants and, especially, the prime minister. Labour has promised a civil service act, putting permanent officialdom on a statutory footing for the first time and has enacted new ethical codes for politicians in local government. But much of our governance still relies on aristocracy - the system relies on the state's toffs intrinsically to know right and wrong. As a matter of fact, they do behave rather well. Peculation is remarkably absent from British public life. But recent events show how little faith the public has in such self- regulation.</p> <p>But where do we start writ ing down the ineffable elements of the British constitution? The obvious place is Number 10. The ministerial code belongs to the prime minister and is put into effect by the prime minister. He is judge and jury on breaches, as Peter Mandelson complains. What the prime minister does not know, the cabinet secretary is there to tell him. But the Aitken and Robinson affairs showed how ill-equipped is Whitehall 's head prefect to handle politicians. Besides, quis custodiet? If in principle the prime minister is bound by the same rules as his colleagues, to whom does Sir Richard Wilson report his receipt of hospitality? Paragraph 128 of the code says ministers receiving food, drink (and hotel rooms) from sources that might \"reasonably be thought likely to influence ministerial action\", should make a declaration in the Commons register of interests. Sir Richard's problem is that he is the conscience and alter ego of the system and a similar problem of ultimate unaccountability would beset an independent custodian of public ethics.</p> <p>We need, it seems, to invent mechanisms to call the prime minister better to account for his handling of his immediate colleagues. An obvious one is the Commons, but are we ready for such a radical recalibration of the powers of executive and legislature or what it would mean for political parties?</p> <p>A holding answer seems to be more detailed specification of duties and responsibilities - the substitution of rules for discretion. Sometime soon we are going to have to go back to first principles and set out in black and white just what it is min isters (and their departmental officials) exist to do. Look at the chart: is that variable performance in answering MPs a legitimate sign of ministerial ineptitude? At present there are no objective measures of how well a minister heads a department, delivers policy targets or sustains cabinet government. The code tells ministers to put cabinet business before all else but neglects to say what cabinet government - as opposed to prime ministerial autocracy - is meant to look like. To say a minister is effective in office might be no defence against a charge of corruption but it might put things in proportion.</p>",

Today's document is a compendious mix of high principle and practical advice on avoiding trouble. It is on the Cabinet Office website at www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/ central/1997/mcode/index.htm. Its cardinal rule is giving parliament \"accurate and truthful information\" while - relevant in the Mandelson case - \"correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\". There are sections on gifts, ministers' private interests, lobbyists, constituency dealings: few of the Mandelson and Keith Vaz events, real or alleged, are not covered by it at least in outline. \"Ministers must scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or apparent conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests.\" Gifts worth up to \u00a3140 each may be kept, otherwise they have to be handed over to civil servants and sold off or \"displayed\" in a Whitehall glass case. Ministers must not use knowledge which brings \"benefit (or could arouse reasonable suspicion of this) in relation to their private financial interests\". Tony Wright and fellow members of the public administration committee want the code better known, perhaps aligned with the rules for other public officials and put under the supervision of a codefinder-general. It is a moot point whether ministers are schooled in their ethical obligations with sufficient rigour. Did the permanent secretary at the Trade Department thrust a copy into the hands of for example, Peter Hain on his recent transfer there? There are bound to be energy industry interests wanting to sup with him. The MPs suggest recording all lobbying episodes. If that had happened over the ministers' relationship with the Hinduja brothers there would at least be less room for disagreement about facts. But tinkering with the code would not address a central problem in the way we govern ourselves. The code itself relies on uncodified powers wielded by civil servants and, especially, the prime minister. Labour has promised a civil service act, putting permanent officialdom on a statutory footing for the first time and has enacted new ethical codes for politicians in local government. But much of our governance still relies on aristocracy - the system relies on the state's toffs intrinsically to know right and wrong. As a matter of fact, they do behave rather well. Peculation is remarkably absent from British public life. But recent events show how little faith the public has in such self- regulation. But where do we start writ ing down the ineffable elements of the British constitution? The obvious place is Number 10. The ministerial code belongs to the prime minister and is put into effect by the prime minister. He is judge and jury on breaches, as Peter Mandelson complains. What the prime minister does not know, the cabinet secretary is there to tell him. But the Aitken and Robinson affairs showed how ill-equipped is Whitehall 's head prefect to handle politicians. Besides, quis custodiet? If in principle the prime minister is bound by the same rules as his colleagues, to whom does Sir Richard Wilson report his receipt of hospitality? Paragraph 128 of the code says ministers receiving food, drink (and hotel rooms) from sources that might \"reasonably be thought likely to influence ministerial action\", should make a declaration in the Commons register of interests. Sir Richard's problem is that he is the conscience and alter ego of the system and a similar problem of ultimate unaccountability would beset an independent custodian of public ethics. We need, it seems, to invent mechanisms to call the prime minister better to account for his handling of his immediate colleagues. An obvious one is the Commons, but are we ready for such a radical recalibration of the powers of executive and legislature or what it would mean for political parties? A holding answer seems to be more detailed specification of duties and responsibilities - the substitution of rules for discretion. Sometime soon we are going to have to go back to first principles and set out in black and white just what it is min isters (and their departmental officials) exist to do. Look at the chart: is that variable performance in answering MPs a legitimate sign of ministerial ineptitude? At present there are no objective measures of how well a minister heads a department, delivers policy targets or sustains cabinet government. The code tells ministers to put cabinet business before all else but neglects to say what cabinet government - as opposed to prime ministerial autocracy - is meant to look like. To say a minister is effective in office might be no defence against a charge of corruption but it might put things in proportion.",

      "bodyText": "Barclaycard, Britain's biggest credit card issuer, is to offer the facility to thousands of people it previously turned down under a new initiative that it says will help tackle the problem of financial exclusion. The company said the new card was aimed at those it has declined in the past because of their credit history - some 700,000 people last year alone - and it expects to recruit between 3,000 and 5,000 customers a month. Barclaycard traditionally turns down at least half of the people who apply for a card but will now consider people whose credit records are less than perfect because, for example, they have a minor county court judgment against them from previous years or they have moved home a number of times. The company, which has a 25% share of the British market, is the first of the big traditional issuers to offer cards to people who have been rejected because of credit history. It said it was launching the card - which will have the same name - in response to the \"overwhelming desire\" among the public for reputable lenders to provide products for those who have experienced problems obtaining credit. Until now only a handful of US-based card issuers, such as Capital One, Providian and The Associates, have been prepared to take on people who have had debt problems in the past. The government has made tackling financial exclusion a priority because of concern that those people who fall outside the rigid criteria of credit and loan companies are sometimes driven into the arms of loan sharks charging interest rates of up to 500%. Those people Barclaycard takes on will pay one of two interest rates - either its standard 19.4%APR or a higher rate of 24.9%APR depending on their credit score. This, however, could prompt criticism that the company is creating a two-tier system.",

As a 15-year-old growing up in Harefield, Hertfordshire, it was Lights Out Lane - he was a talented middle-weight boxer who fought for the home counties against the Federal Republic of Germany. Lane raises his left fist, then his right. Both are slightly gnarled. He chirps: \"Gelignite - dynamite. Take your pick, 'cos you're going to sleep!\"</p> <p>When he was a 20-year-old businessman who wore designer clothes and drove a Porsche 911 Targa, Lane went by two other nicknames: Catwalk Kev and Mr Particular. There is no reason to ask why. Lane is handsome. His boyish face and broad shoulders make him seem much younger than 33. His dark-blue shirt appears to have been ironed and his shoes polished. But it is by another name that he has become notorious, and this one wipes the smile from his face: the Executioner.</p> <p>Four years ago, Lane was convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Robert Magill, a 44-year-old businessman who was gunned down near his home in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, as he walked his dog, Oscar, on his way to nearby Chorley Wood Common on October 13, 1994. The jury heard Magill was shot five times, twice in the head, at \"very close range\".</p> <p>The judge in his second trial, Neil Denison, described the attack as \"desperately violent, shocking, horrifying\". With a case that even prosecutors admitted was flimsy, Lane was accused of being a professional hitman who had been paid between pounds 40,000 and pounds 100,000. But that was just the start.</p> <p>Following his conviction, Lane says he was the victim of a sustained smear campaign. In various newspapers, he was dubbed the Executioner, and linked to other unsolved murders. They included the assassinations of Charlie Wilson, the Great Train Robber targeted on the Costa del Sol in 1990, and Karen Reed, a 33-year-old geophysicist, who was shot on the doorstep of her home in Surrey in April 1994 by a man posing as a pizza delivery rider. One report claimed Lane had also worked to order for the Russian mafia.</p> <p>When the TV presenter Jill Dando was shot on the doorstep of her home in Fulham in April 1999, Lane's name cropped up again. At the time, detectives wanted advice from expert hitmen. Newspapers said they turned to Lane to ask whether Dando's murderer was the work of a professional.</p> <p>\"Nobody from the Dando team came to see me,\" he says. \"It was rubbish, like most of the stuff that has been in the papers. Being wrongly convicted of one was bad enough. Then, overnight, I became a multiple murderer.\"</p> <p>Lane says there is another story - his story - and it has only been half told. \"Just hear me out,\" he says. \"Then make up your own mind.\"</p> <p>During the two visits I have paid him, and in several letters he has sent me from jail, Lane has described his life. He does not pretend he has never been in trouble. He has anecdotes that sound like scenes from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But a killer? \"No way.\"</p> <p>A prolific hitman?</p> <p>\"It's just nonsense. I'll pick my hands up for a fight, but that's my limit.\"</p> <p>He points to the evidence against him for the Magill murder. The prosecution relied on a set of coincidences Lane felt too fearful to explain at the time because he and his 52-year-old mother, Barbara, had been warned \"to keep quiet\". Lane is planning an appeal with the help of Vicky King, a lawyer with the London firm Thanki Novy Taube. His campaign is building momentum and has been invigorated recently by two very different sources.</p> <p>The criminal cases review commission, which investigates alleged miscarriages of justice, has launched its own inquiry into the conviction - an unusual, proactive step. Normally, the commission only becomes involved following the rejection of a first appeal. And two criminals, influential figures in north London's underworld, contacted King out of the blue to insist Lane was not the murderer. They are the sort of men who would know.</p> <p>Listening to Lane talk about his life, it is easy to see why his nicknames never included Lucky. The second eldest of eight children, his parents split up when he was a child. His father, Joseph, died \"from drink\" nine years ago, aged 44. His mother went abroad for several years when he was a teenager, leaving him in the care of friends. Ask Lane about his childhood and he recalls Special Patrol Group vans lining up outside pubs on his council estate ready for the rucks that started at closing time.</p> <p>At secondary school in south Ruislip, he fell for a 14-year-old girl called Kim Purcell. This, he says, was the turning point in his life. \"Other kids said to me: 'Kev, you know who she is, don't you?' I hadn't the faintest idea. I quickly discovered the Purcell family included some of the main criminals in the area.\"</p> <p>Kim's uncle, Pat, the head of the family, who is due to be released from Whitemoor prison later this year, treated Lane like a son, and through the Purcells, Lane was introduced to the fringes of the criminal underworld, learning to survive on his wits and with his fists.</p> <p>The family gave him work as a doorman, and then sold him a security firm. With Lane in charge - he was still only 18 - it flourished. At its peak, he was pro viding doormen for 12 pubs and six clubs in west London, earning pounds 800 a week - more than enough to keep Kim and their two sons, Tommy and Aaron.</p> <p>Lane is short for a bouncer - 5ft 11in - but those who worked for him say he was one of the best in the business. \"There are advantages in being my size. When you approach a man who is 6ft 6in and ask him to calm down, he's not likely to feel threatened.</p> <p>\"But if someone wanted a fight, I could take care of myself. I was very quick. If a man came at me with a knife, I'd have a go. If he came at me with a gun, I'd still have a go. To be honest, I've never needed to carry a weapon.\"</p> <p>Lane remembers once being on the door of a pub called the Firefly in Hayes, Middlesex. There had been trouble earlier in the day and the landlord wanted emergency cover. As Lane stood outside, a car slowed down and a man called out: \"Do you want some of this?\"</p> <p>\"He pointed a shotgun at me,\" says Lane. \"He said he was going to kill me. I replied: 'Go on then.' And he bloody shot me! I didn't even know the kid. I ducked and several shotgun pellets shaved the top of my head. I've got still got six in my skull. I've never seen the guy since.\"</p> <p>Some who crossed Lane learned the hard way. He and two others kidnapped a man they suspected of stealing pounds 100,000 worth of electrical equipment. \"We put a car on his legs and threw him in the Grand Union Canal. But we weren't going to kill him! We just roughed him up a bit.\" For that assault, Lane spent 14 months in prison - his only term before the Magill murder.</p> <p>A year after his release, Lane had left door work and was making a good living through a range of business ventures ranging from organising raves to selling vacuum cleaners. But his life was about to change again.</p> <p>He broke up with Kim and, in the spring of 1994, left the UK for Tenerife, where a friend had offered him work. Kim followed him and pleaded with him to return, which he did on September 29 - her birthday. Back at home in Potton, Cambridgeshire, Lane got in touch with his relatives and friends - hardly, he points out, a sensible thing for an assassin to do.</p> <p>By then, Magill, a car trader and known villain, had been warned that there was a contract on his head. But he had made so many enemies, he didn't know where the threat came from. He became a prisoner in his own heavily protected home in Valley Road, Rickmansworth, venturing out once a day to take his dog for a walk. During his stroll at 8.20am on Thursday October 13, two men got out of a battered X-registered BMW as he approached the junction with Berry Lane. One shot him five times with a pump-action weapon, the other kept look-out.</p> <p>The case against Lane, who was arrested three months after the murder, was based on one piece of forensic evidence found in the car, and several coincidences.</p> <p>People who knew Lane were undoubtedly involved in the murder. The weekend before the assassination, Lane borrowed a BMW from a friend - his own car had been stolen - and used it to take Kim and the boys to see his mother, who had moved to Hillingdon. He said he returned it on Sunday evening. Four days later it was used by the killers as their getaway vehicle. When detectives recovered the car, they found Lane's fingerprint on a binliner in the boot. Scientists also found firearms discharge on a piece of plastic piping, and speculated that it had contained a weapon of some sort.</p> <p>Lane never denied driving the car - his sons' fingerprints were all over the dashboard. \"But I didn't have it the day Magill died. I used it once, that's all.\"</p> <p>Lane says he knew something was up because he was called hours after the murder by a criminal contact who warned him that the police might pay a visit. \"He didn't say anything else. He said there was nothing to worry about. I wasn't going to hang around for a knock on the door, so I took Kim and the kids to Newcastle for a short break.\"</p> <p>To detectives, who had launched a huge investigation, his trip to the north-east pointed to his involvement in the murder. Lane's decision not to tell them about the call hardly helped. Nor did he tell them that his mother had also been threatened by a motorcycle rider who appeared at her front door one morning, warning her and Kevin to keep quiet.</p> <p>The police had two other clues. Shortly after the murder, Lane bought a car for pounds 5,400. Detectives speculated the money was part of his payment, though admitted there was no proof. Lane said it was money he had left in a safe before going to Tenerife, and that he had witnesses to back his story. Officers also discovered Lane flew back to the UK using an exit visa with the name Paul Curtis.\"We suspected he'd been recruited when he was in Tenerife and returned to do this specific job,\" says one detective involved in the inquiry. \"As far as we were concerned, the pieces of the jigsaw had fallen into place.\"</p> <p>Lane insists they jumped to the wrong conclusion. He says he couldn't return to the UK using his real passport because he was in trouble with the Spanish police over a brawl in a restaurant called The Steak House. However, again he didn't tell detectives about the fight.</p> <p>After consulting with his then lawyers, Lane decided not to tell the jury about his connections to the underworld, a tactic he now considers a huge misjudgment. Instead, the defence focused on the major flaws in the prosecution. There were, for instance, two eyewitnesses to Magill's shooting, but neither picked out Lane at identity parades. Strangely, all the early police messages - reports from informants about likely suspects - made no mention of Lane. Two other names cropped up time and again.</p> <p>How the police came to look at Lane in the first place has never been fully explained, and is an important avenue for Lane's new solicitor. Their suspicion is that his name was forwarded by the killer to cover himself. Even the police admit they were lucky to convict.</p> <p>The jury failed to reach a verdict on Lane the first time round and his co-defendant Roger Vincent was acquitted. A retrial was ordered. A second jury deliberated for nine hours and three minutes before reaching a majority decision that Lane was guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years, and has been told he will serve at least 25. He has lost Kim, who has re-married, and he hardly sees his sons.</p> <p>\" Kevin Lane has not lived a crime-free life, but is he a contract killer? I am convinced that he is not,\" says King. \"His lifestyle allowed the police to fit a case around him. His fear of those who told him to keep his mouth shut conspired to prevent him from telling the jury about his background. If he had not had any underworld connections, then he would not be where he is now. It would have been impossible to make the case stick.\"</p> <p>Lane has not been charged with any other murders since he was in prison, and detectives now admit there is no concrete evidence to link him to any other shooting.</p> <p>\"If I had killed Magill, I would have got out of the country immediately,\" Lane says, \"I wouldn't have hung around and bought a new car. All the way through the trial, people were saying to me: 'Don't worry, Kev, they've nothing on you, you'll get off.' And I believed them. Now I'm locked up for something I didn't do, and I've been accused of murders all over the place.</p> <p>\"I'm not a grass, but I've been inside far too long. I'm not going to give up. I know I can prove my innocence.\"</p>",

The subject is nicknames, the only matter he is prepared to discuss in something more than a whisper. We are sitting on low chairs around a low table - everything here is bolted to the floor - and we are surrounded by three prison officers. One is within arm's reach.

In releasing its profits figures a week earlier than planned, Abbey is expected to produce statistics which show that it has boosted its 5% share of the current account market. Such figures are expected to be central to any decision made by Mr Byers who faces a decision of whether a combined Lloyds/Abbey current account share of close to 30% poises competition fears. If he decides to recommend the bid to the competition commission it could delay Lloyds TSB's ambitions by six months. Shareholders in Abbey have indicated that they intend to wait for the outcome of any investigation rather than support Abbey's preferred option of a merger with Bank of Scotland. Sources close to Abbey insisted last night that the decision to publish profits early was an attempt to allow the bank time to talk to shareholders ahead of any decision by the government. It was originally intended to publish pre-tax profits in the region of \u00a31.9bn on February 22, the day before Mr Byers' deadline.",
