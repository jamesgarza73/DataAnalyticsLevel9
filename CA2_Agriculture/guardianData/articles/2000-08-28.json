Even if Faur\u00e9's music acknowledges its debt to Wagner with a web of leitmotifs, P\u00e9n\u00e9lope's idiom is recognisably Faur\u00e9's own. </p> <p>What makes the opera so original is the symbiotic relationship between Faur\u00e9's magical scoring and his unique harmonic sense. Although the piece is indebted to lush, late-19th-century chromatic harmony, there's something classical about the ambience of Faur\u00e9's soundworld. Everything is reined-in and contained, yet there are some startling, prophetic moments. When P\u00e9n\u00e9lope uncovers her loom, Faur\u00e9's accompaniment is a simple bed of string and harp sonority. But the voicing of this chord transforms it into something compelling and strange. </p> <p>Even if the pace of the music is languid, Faur\u00e9's concision creates a persuasive dramatic momentum. The story is an unfussy telling of the return of Ulysseto his home, Ithaca, and his plan to kill the suitors who have been tormenting his wife. P\u00e9n\u00e9lope carries everyone else in her lamenting wake. Other characters are reduced to their dramatic function as part of the plot to save her. The suitors, headed by Christopher Maltman's Eurymaque, are priapic villains with no redeeming qualities; Donald Maxwell's Eum\u00e9e is a rustic do-gooder; and there is a bevy of silly serving-girls. </p> <p>Soprano Michelle DeYoung's P\u00e9n\u00e9lope has a towering presence. The fullness of her voice is matched by the fluidity of her phrasing. And on the few occasions when Faur\u00e9 calls for it, she has huge, declamatory power at the very summit of her voice. Tenor Michael Schade is vengefully heroic as Ulysse, and provides enthusiastic energy to contrast with P\u00e9n\u00e9lope's mostly reflective music.

The windfall cash from the sale will be used to reduce indebtedness at Airtours which earlier this month reported a massive downturn in quarterly profits to June 30. </p> <p>It said its annual results would be scarred by the under-performance of its German operation, Frosch Touristik, in which it has a 36% holding, and the general downturn in the US market. </p> <p>Airtours chairman David Crossland said it still had its eye on expansion in the future. </p> <p>\"The proceeds will put us in an even better position to invest in business areas both in Europe and North America, which provide attractive opportunities for strong growth in profits and cashflow.\" </p> <p>Airtours said it was selling its stake because the European cruise market was becoming increasingly competitive and players needed large amounts of investment in new ships to stay ahead. </p> <p>But the company stressed that the decision on Costa Crociere would not affect its own mid-market Sun Cruises operation which provides fly-cruise packages to its in-house tour operators. </p> <p>Costa Crociere has a fleet of seven ships offering cruises through the Mediterranean, northern Europe, South America and the Caribbean.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Holiday group Airtours yesterday announced plans to pull out of the luxury cruise sector by disposing of its 50% stake in Italy's Costa Crociere to one of its own shareholders, Carnival Corp. Airtours, under financial pressure after problems with its German and North American operations, booked itself a handsome profit by selling for \u00a3350m the 50% stake it bought for \u00a32.25m in Costa Crociere only three years ago. Carnival, which already controls the other half of the Italian company and owns 26% of Airtours, will consolidate its position as the world's largest cruise ship operator with 48 vessels. It plans to use its stronger position in Europe to invest in new tonnage and the moves could squeeze other competitors such as P&amp;O, which plans a separate listing for its cruise operation this autumn. The windfall cash from the sale will be used to reduce indebtedness at Airtours which earlier this month reported a massive downturn in quarterly profits to June 30. It said its annual results would be scarred by the under-performance of its German operation, Frosch Touristik, in which it has a 36% holding, and the general downturn in the US market. Airtours chairman David Crossland said it still had its eye on expansion in the future. \"The proceeds will put us in an even better position to invest in business areas both in Europe and North America, which provide attractive opportunities for strong growth in profits and cashflow.\" Airtours said it was selling its stake because the European cruise market was becoming increasingly competitive and players needed large amounts of investment in new ships to stay ahead. But the company stressed that the decision on Costa Crociere would not affect its own mid-market Sun Cruises operation which provides fly-cruise packages to its in-house tour operators. Costa Crociere has a fleet of seven ships offering cruises through the Mediterranean, northern Europe, South America and the Caribbean.",

There were the predictable howls of anger from the usual suspects; as Greg Dyke said in his keynote speech at the Guardian Edinburgh international television festival, propose any change at the BBC and you get accused of dumbing down. But the decision to force the likes of Michael Buerk and Peter Sissons to stay up later every night is not simply a scheduling move: it is the first salvo in a revolutionary transformation of the BBC channels. </p> <p>In a pledge that may come back to haunt him, Dyke confidently predicted that a news bulletin at 10pm would get better ratings than at 9pm. It was, he said, the main reason for shifting the bulletin into the slot abandoned by ITV. As everyone listening to the speech knew, that was a classic BBC smokescreen: the main reason for moving the news to 10pm is to get better ratings for BBC1's peak-time shows. After just a year at the corporation, Dyke is already retreating behind the BBC double-speak that so many had hoped he would banish. Observers simply could not understand why he did not declare unashamedly that BBC1 should maintain its position as a mass-appeal channel chasing high ratings - the key justification of the licence fee. </p> <p>Nevertheless, if he pulls it off, Dyke will earn himself the reputation of the man who saved the BBC from the ravages of the digital age, maintaining the corporation as a universal broadcaster at the centre of cultural life in Britain. The risks of the strategy cannot be underestimated: mess it up and the BBC will be left in ruins. </p> <p>The MacTaggart lecture revealed Dyke to be far more than just a budget-cutting croissant-killer. He has a long-term, detailed and coherent vision for the BBC that is designed to take it into the digital age and preserve the public service broadcasting heritage to which it owes its present strength. </p> <p>The portfolio of seven channels outlined by Dyke on Friday serves a broad constituency of British viewers, from those who wish simply to be entertained, others who want to widen their view of the world, to those who crave intellectual stimulation from the most cerebral of sources. </p> <p>The channel propositions are clear: big-hitting entertainment, drama and factual programmes on BBC1, slightly more serious and innovative stuff on BBC2, music and comedy aimed at a youth audience on BBC3, and an \"unashamedly intellectual\" combination of Radio 3 and Radio 4 on the fourth network. Combined with two children's services, one for pre-school children and another for their older counterparts, plus BBC News 24, the result is a \"suite\" of channels for almost every constituency. </p> <p>Less obvious is the corporation's capacity to deliver the Dyke vision. Scepticism dripped from bar stools all over Edinburgh at the weekend as Dyke's colleagues in the industry mulled over the most important challenges facing the country's national broadcaster since the onset of satellite television more than a decade ago. Dyke, speaking after his delivering his lecture, admitted that his proposition depended upon harnessing talent in a way never before achieved at the BBC. To make BBC1's prime-time schedule work, the corporation will need to fight harder than ever to win the watershed battle. </p> <p>Citing Walking With Dinosaurs as the benchmark of quality for all genres, the director of television, Mark Thompson, says it will mean plenty of good entertainment, documentaries and natural history shows scheduled at the key 9pm \"junction\" - but in reality, it will be the quality of the BBC's drama that makes or breaks this particular fight. \"We are under no illusions. This is the biggest creative challenge the BBC has ever faced,\" Thompson says. </p> <p>Dyke is taking an unenviable gamble, pitching the corporation into a direct conflict with its main commercial competitor on the adult drama battleground that is awash with BBC blood. There is serious money - almost \u00a3500m over three years - to patch up the wounds, but some believe that it will take more than money to win the war. </p> <p>Steve Hewlett, the director of programmes at Carlton, and a former BBC man, applauds the big picture. \"It seems sound, a coherent vision of the BBC's television services for the future. That, I think, is positive. As a programme-making strategy, it is something that you could sign up to.\" But he sounds a warning over the practicalities. \"The devil is in the detail. The BBC's apparent incapacity to come up with long-run, popular, returnable drama series to match ITV has got nothing to do with money. That is not the answer to this problem. There is a creative cultural problem within the BBC that goes deeper than lack of money.\" </p> <p>Another senior ITV executive goes even further. There is a climate, he says, of \"commissioning by fear\". Peter Salmon, BBC1's controller, is so afraid of the consequences of any decision he makes that projects are delayed and risks avoided. </p> <p>Peter Bazalgette, of Bazal Productions, makers of Big Brother, agrees: he did not offer the surprise hit to the BBC because it would have been more trouble than it was worth. </p> <p>Hewlett believes that the cultural malaise at the BBC stems from the decision by Dyke's predecessor, John Birt, to split the broadcasting and production divisions. That meant that heads of creative departments became managers, desperate to sell as many of their products to the channel controllers as they could, with far less regard for quality. </p> <p>Dyke has repaired the split, but, according to Hewlett, has installed a management and commissioning structure that is a political fudge. \"From the outside, the structure is unclear, in terms of who's supposed to do what.\" </p> <p>Even if the new structure works, there is a serious question over whether there is enough creative talent in the British television industry to sustain the populist proposition for BBC1, as well as the new demands for the other new services. </p> <p>Dyke acknowledges the problem. \"The nagging concern at the back of my mind is: is there the talent in this industry to provide the things we need?\" </p> <p>Nick Elliott, controller of drama at the ITV network, says there will be a battle for talented writers in particular. \"It will be tough for the BBC: 8pm, not 9pm, will be its key point.

They will build on that with pre- watershed family shows and they will try to get the writers we at ITV like.\" </p> <p>Clearly, directing the new money in the right direction is going to be a key challenge.

It is thought that, at the current rate, it will not be too long before about half the country is signed up to digital television through subscription services.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, yesterday accused the Conservatives of stirring up \"fear and prejudice\" after the party claimed patient safety was being put at risk by overseas doctors with a poor grasp of English . In a provocative intervention, the shadow health secretary, Liam Fox , pledged to introduce tough English tests to weed out foreign doctors whose language skills, he claimed, were jeopardising the safety of patients. \"Their English language skills are not up to scratch and patients are suffering as a result,\" Dr Fox said. \"Correcting this is an issue of public safety.\" His remarks were swiftly condemned by Mr Prescott. \"The Tories stand for everything the Tories normally do -fear, prejudice and not delivering,\" he told the BBC's The World This Weekend. The Liberal Democrats accused Dr Fox of \"thinly veiled racism\". Nick Harvey, the party's health spokesman, said: \"This is disgraceful and a slap in the face for the many hard-working doctors who have come from abroad and give their all for the NHS. \"First their attack on asylum seekers and now this. The Tory party is getting nastier as it gets more desperate.\" Last night one of the those involved in setting the English test for the British Council said: \"This is absolute rubbish. The process doctors have to go through is very rigorous. It involves an academic understanding of English and an ability to set it in context.\" The standard required was the equivalent of the postgraduate level for university students. Dr Fox, a rightwinger who practised as a GP before his election to parliament in 1992, sparked the row when he said a Tory government would introduce a tough English language test that might apply to overseas doctors already working in Britain. Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat health spokesman, and like Dr Fox a doctor turned politician, said foreign doctors already faced tough English tests. \"A lot of foreign doctors who work in Britain, particularly the Germans and Dutch, speak better English than us,\" he said. \"Doctors from outside the European economic area have to pass the PLAB [professional and linguistic assessments board] test which has a very tough language component.\" The Department of Health said it was up to NHS trusts to ensure doctors had adequate English . A new system of annual appraisals should show up any weaknesses.",

It is a racist orthodoxy that fits hand-in-glove with that other long-established orthodoxy, that black people are stupid. Backing Entine's claim on television will be Professor Philippe Rushton, who believes that black people's brains are smaller than those of other races, leaving them less intelligent but more highly sexed and agressive. Rushton is reported to have paid 150 participants - 50 black, 50 white, 50 Asian - to answer questions on penis size. His conclusion? \"It's a trade-off: more brain or more penis.

For if success is genetic, then why not failure too? \"White men can't jump\" is only a hop and a skip away from \"Black men can't think, read, write or behave\". In this field Entine is not a daring pioneer but the butt-end of a lineage stretching back centuries. In 1884 the Encyclopedia Britannica stated: \"No full-blooded negro has ever been distinguished as a man of science, a poet or an artist, and the fundamental equality claimed for him by ignorant philanthropists is belied by the whole history of the race throughout the historic period.\"</p> <p>Black people are not the sole targets of this broadside.

For there are the equally compelling statistics in the schools, jails and dole queues of the west that tell another story. Black people fall foul not simply of the law of the land but the law of probabilities in everything from employment to the criminal justice system. In the words of Jesse Jackson: \"We do well at sport because the playing field is even and the rules are public. But when blacks are kicking up the field and people start making up the rules... that's when the problems start.\"</p> <p>\"What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?\" asked the late Trinidadian intellectual, CLR James. He, more than anyone, understood that sport is not a purely meritocratic endeavour but an integral part of a nation or region's cultural, political and economic makeup. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Caribbean, where basketball and football are fast overtaking cricket among the young. Two days before the West Indies were humiliated at Headingly, Trinidad and Tobago thrashed Panama at football 6-0. Yesterday's \"natural\" cricketers are today's \"natural\" footballers. The switch is not in their genes but in their society.</p> <p>Moreover, sport is a multi-million pound business for some and a career choice for others. People take the chances that come their way. If discrimination denies them opportunity in one place and offers it to them elsewhere, they will take it. It is not middle-class African-Americans with the chance to become lawyers, doctors and administrators who are rushing to the starting line or the boxing ring but the poor with few other options.</p> <p>Does this deny any connection between the physiology of black athletes and their sporting achievements?

      "body": "<p>Britain's black population is becoming more confident about its culture and also more at ease living in this country, a survey suggests today.</p> <p>Ties to the West Indies and Africa are reflected in musical tastes and in traditions of worship, but some style-conscious young adults are spending large sums on fashion, confirming just how the community is setting trends for Britons of all backgrounds.</p> <p>The survey also indicates that more black people are happy to remain in Britain for their holidays. However, many have strong doubts about the political system. The Black Community Report, published today, suggests too there has been a rise in smoking heavily and in television watching, and a drop in drinking and taking exercise.</p> <p>The authors of the report, the London-based Peoplescience Intelligence Unit, says blacks feel many aspects of their lives are \"strong and well\" but \"there has been a general feeling among black people that the community has a great deal of untapped potential\".</p> <p>The findings are based on street surveys of nearly 600 blacks aged over 16 in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool. They suggest an increasingly diverse picture, where Afro-Caribbean communities are being matched in some areas by rising numbers of those with more direct links to the African continent.</p> <p>This is indicated by the musical likes of those questioned.</p> <p>Reggae still tops the list - with 39% of those questioned naming it as a popular choice, followed by soul (34%), African music (32%), gospel (29%), and hip-hop (24%). Rock music was mentioned by 2%. When it came to choosing an absolute favourite, gospel and African music both attracted 13% of support, followed by reggae at 12%. Rock and jungle languished at well under 1% each.</p> <p>The strength of religious conviction, indicated by the gospel music figures, is confirmed by the fact that 93% of those questioned said they believed in God, and 73% of them followed a Christian belief system. Nearly one in 10 affirmed the Muslim faith, 6% followed forms of African spirituality, and 4% were Rastafarians.</p> <p>The rapid growth in black congregations was explained further by one in three saying they attended religious services once a week, up from 20% four years ago, and vastly more than the 7.5% of the English population as a whole found by a study of attendance for all denominations.</p> <p>There was a huge increase in the number of black people saying they took holidays in Britain - 27%, compared with 10% in 1996.</p> <p>Europe attracted 26% of those questioned and the US 23%. A fifth went to the Caribbean, and a similar proportion went to Africa. A quarter had not been on holiday anywhere.</p> <p>While most black adults do not spend more than \u00a325 a week on fashion, beauty and their hair, a fifth spend up to \u00a350, 8% spent up to \u00a375, and 5% spent more than that. Many of the higher spenders were young men.</p> <p>Drinking appeared to be falling. Four in 10 said they did not drink, an increase on the 31% of 1996. A third of the community said they smoked cigarettes, with one in five admitting to using cannabis, down from 22% four years ago. Only 46% said they played the National Lottery, compared with 60% for the population as a whole.</p> <p>When asked to rate how well black MPs represented the black community, 19% rated them poorly at 0 to 2, while 15% gave ratings of 8 -10. Four in 10 people did not understand what proportional representation meant.</p> <p>Yet nearly half those questioned (45%) thought an independent black political party would serve their communities better, against 14% who did not think there would be a difference and 11% who thought that would make matters worse. Another 28% were unsure. With four black MPs in parliament, mainstream parties will be concerned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's black population is becoming more confident about its culture and also more at ease living in this country, a survey suggests today. Ties to the West Indies and Africa are reflected in musical tastes and in traditions of worship, but some style-conscious young adults are spending large sums on fashion, confirming just how the community is setting trends for Britons of all backgrounds. The survey also indicates that more black people are happy to remain in Britain for their holidays. However, many have strong doubts about the political system. The Black Community Report, published today, suggests too there has been a rise in smoking heavily and in television watching, and a drop in drinking and taking exercise. The authors of the report, the London-based Peoplescience Intelligence Unit, says blacks feel many aspects of their lives are \"strong and well\" but \"there has been a general feeling among black people that the community has a great deal of untapped potential\". The findings are based on street surveys of nearly 600 blacks aged over 16 in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool. They suggest an increasingly diverse picture, where Afro-Caribbean communities are being matched in some areas by rising numbers of those with more direct links to the African continent. This is indicated by the musical likes of those questioned. Reggae still tops the list - with 39% of those questioned naming it as a popular choice, followed by soul (34%), African music (32%), gospel (29%), and hip-hop (24%). Rock music was mentioned by 2%. When it came to choosing an absolute favourite, gospel and African music both attracted 13% of support, followed by reggae at 12%. Rock and jungle languished at well under 1% each. The strength of religious conviction, indicated by the gospel music figures, is confirmed by the fact that 93% of those questioned said they believed in God, and 73% of them followed a Christian belief system. Nearly one in 10 affirmed the Muslim faith, 6% followed forms of African spirituality, and 4% were Rastafarians. The rapid growth in black congregations was explained further by one in three saying they attended religious services once a week, up from 20% four years ago, and vastly more than the 7.5% of the English population as a whole found by a study of attendance for all denominations. There was a huge increase in the number of black people saying they took holidays in Britain - 27%, compared with 10% in 1996. Europe attracted 26% of those questioned and the US 23%. A fifth went to the Caribbean, and a similar proportion went to Africa. A quarter had not been on holiday anywhere. While most black adults do not spend more than \u00a325 a week on fashion, beauty and their hair, a fifth spend up to \u00a350, 8% spent up to \u00a375, and 5% spent more than that. Many of the higher spenders were young men. Drinking appeared to be falling. Four in 10 said they did not drink, an increase on the 31% of 1996. A third of the community said they smoked cigarettes, with one in five admitting to using cannabis, down from 22% four years ago. Only 46% said they played the National Lottery, compared with 60% for the population as a whole. When asked to rate how well black MPs represented the black community, 19% rated them poorly at 0 to 2, while 15% gave ratings of 8 -10. Four in 10 people did not understand what proportional representation meant. Yet nearly half those questioned (45%) thought an independent black political party would serve their communities better, against 14% who did not think there would be a difference and 11% who thought that would make matters worse. Another 28% were unsure. With four black MPs in parliament, mainstream parties will be concerned.",

The tour has grossed $37m in two years, but most critics are still scratching their heads, wondering where the four came from. </p> <p>The film, The Original Kings of Comedy, is likely to change all that. \"I wanted to see this [tour] on film because it had to be documented,\" says Lee. \"Being on film would enable a lot more people to see it. This was a cultural event. The people who came out for this saved their money, bought new outfits and really got worked up. It was the most successful comedy tour ever and mainstream America didn't even really know about it.\" </p> <p>The film took $12m in its opening weekend in the US. It is already being compared to black comedy concert classics such as Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip, Martin Lawrence's You So Crazy and Eddie Murphy's Raw. Variety said The Original Kings of Comedy was \"consistently hilarious\" and Lee \"conveys a palpable sense of the rousing, communal energy of the live performance.\" </p> <p>It was filmed over two nights in February at the Charlotte Coliseum in North Carolina, where the tour had kicked off in 1997. Lee used 12 cameras, two of them weaving among the audience. Each comedian does his set in turn. Host Harvey's speciality is satire, his comedy perhaps smarter than the others: he rants against rap music and tells the story of a black sportsman who fled to Nashville to escape the police, \"like they ain't gonna find your black ass there\". Hughley, with his wry, scathing wit, verbally beats up the audience and attacks bad jobs, bad bosses and grandparents who take Viagra. Cedric is the lovable, mischievous, rotund one who sings, dances, juggles his gags and does hilarious impressions of golf-playing black people trying to make like Tiger Woods. And Mac, with his bug-eyes and raspy voice, is all in your face, raw and hardcore, making jokes about beating the kids. </p> <p>So why have these comedians suddenly made it? The key words are \"relatively unknown\". Harvey, for instance, is not a household name in the US. But his self-titled sitcom is starting its fifth season on the WB network and is one of the most popular TV shows in black households; he also hosts a Showtime at the Apollo TV series. Mac has appeared in numerous movies including Life, Friday, and Spike Lee's Get On the Bus. Cedric the Entertainer hosted Black Entertainment Television's stand-up show, Comic View, in 1994, the year he won the channel's Richard Pryor comic of the year award. Hughley has his own self-titled sitcom, The Hughleys, based on his experience of moving from the 'hood to the 'burbs, and like Cedric the Entertainer has been tearing up the black comedy circuit for years. </p> <p>So although the four were not big mainstream names, they had high profiles among their target audience. The established pattern is to build a following on the circuit, secure a sitcom which increases your profile, then go for the big one - Hollywood maybe - where your hard-won audience will ensure the black dollars come flooding in. It is a tradition of black American comedy, begun by Richard Pryor in the 70s and followed by Eddie Murphy in the 80s, Chris Rock in the 90s, and Martin Lawrence and Chris Tucker now. </p> <p> The volatile chemistry of their very distinctive styles also lies behind the Kings' success. What they all share, in Variety's words, is \"rapid-fire delivery and a take-no-prisoners attitude\". Their material covers being poor, the workplace, dysfunctional families, child-rearing, growing old disgracefully, sex, church and parents, all discussed with foulmouthed glee. </p> <p>It is all a far cry from the schoolteachers and responsible fathers they play in their sitcoms (and the Kings, aged from mid-30s to early 40s, are all family men themselves). Perhaps this is why the show has an old-school flavour; Curtis Mayfield and James Brown are the kind of background grooves they perform to. </p> <p>At 29, the tour's promoter Walter Latham is almost from a different generation. He spent his youth listening to Richard Pryor records, borrowed $4,000 from his mother and promoted his first show, a rap concert, in 1992. In 1997 he formed the Kings. He promoted the tour on black radio stations, eschewing mainstream TV and press attention. His dream is to bring together the Kings with Martin Lawrence, Tucker and Rock. But for now he is content that his company, Latham Entertainment, co-produced the film of the concert with MTV Films and Lee's Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks. The budget for the digital production now seems a snip at $3m. </p> <p>Burt Laurent, a British comedy tour promoter and director of the Black International Comedy Awards, has been following the tour closely. It shows that \"the black pound has a high value and there should be more product geared towards that audience,\" he says. \"It's proof that black comedy is worth a phenomenal amount of money.\" Could it work here? \"Obviously it wouldn't be on the same scale but I believe it could and I'm in the process of putting it together. I'm talking to Felix Dexter, Curtis Walker, Gina Yashere, Roy Diamond and Angie Le Mar about doing something.\" </p> <p>More deals are under way for the performers on the back of Lee's film.

      "body": "<p>It's often said that, at their best, newspapers provide the first rough draft of history. What is too often overlooked is that, at their second-best, which is more normally the case anyway, papers deny the existence of history. </p> <p>There are many reasons, and the prime one is the most obvious: news is, by its very nature, immediate. It is, supposedly, new and different and it would be inappropriate to set every event in its historical context. </p> <p>News is also the main part of a commodity. It must help to sell the paper and would lose its commercial impact if its freshness was undermined by referring to the fact that it has happened before, is not really unique at all and, seen in that light, quite inconsequential. Giving readers a historical perspective takes up space and draws heavily on the time - and, of course, the expertise - of the journalist. It is therefore costly and, given the cult of youth that pervades so many papers nowadays, there are often too few people around editorial floors with a working knowledge of post-war modern history. </p> <p>Perhaps the most pernicious reason for our ahistorical press is its political agenda. When events call into question a policy line avidly pursued by a paper, throwing into doubt the trenchant \"advice\" offered to readers down the years, then it proves convenient to ignore history altogether. </p> <p>A combination of these factors, with the last undoubtedly the most prevalent, occurred in the coverage of loyalist gang warfare in Northern Ireland last week. Rightwing papers suddenly found themselves in a tricky situation because the story did not fit neatly into the previous 30-year pattern of events. </p> <p>In that paradigm, all the troubles in the \"province\" stemmed from malevolent republicans. In recent years, with the IRA ceasefire and Sinn Fein's incorporation into elected office, these papers have opened a second front by pouring scorn on the concept and the practice of the peace process. </p> <p>Yet the vast majority of republicans have remained stubbornly faithful to the ballot box, making it difficult for the hostile Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Times and Sun to continue with their anti-peace process propaganda war. </p> <p>Then along comes Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair and an opportunity of sorts is gratefully accepted. The usual suspects - Ruth Dudley-Edwards, Michael Gove, Bruce Anderson - were wheeled out along with their unnamed leader-writing sympathisers to hammer the government. </p> <p>The outbreak of internecine strife on the Shankill was, according to Anderson in the Mail, due to politicians having created \"a moral vacuum in which such madness can fester\". </p> <p>Gove in the Times blamed John Major and Tony Blair for appeasement. The Telegraph referred to the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, as living in an \"Alice in Wonderland world\" and claimed that Adair \"ruled the roost because of the Belfast agreement\". So far, so bad. Even on this single point, no historical context was allowed to peep through. No mention, for instance, of the people of Ireland having voted overwhelmingly for the agreement, which stated categorically that prisoners would be released. </p> <p>The Times, unlike the Telegraph, did at least praise Mandelson for Adair's arrest. But its columnist Gove led the way in offering a scandalous justification for the Protestant paramilitaries' gangsterism.Their hostility towards the peace process, he dared to claim, is fuelled by the fact that Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness is in government. </p> <p>And there, of course, is the return to the central agenda: it's all the uppity republicans' fault after all. The Daily Mail nodded in agreement, referring to \"the government's endless concessions to republicans\". </p> <p>The Sun, smoothly eliding loyalist gangs with the Provisionals, muddied the waters still further by asserting that \"the IRA runs its protection and drug rackets\". For years, journalists - and the RUC - have tried, and failed, to make this claim stick. Yet, without a shred of evidence, the Sun is happy to repeat the lie because, even with two loyalist gangs killing each other, it is important to remind readers of the main enemy. </p> <p>Similarly, a Telegraph leader informed us that \"some senior policemen... now believe that republican and loyalist paramilitaries could soon become big players... on the mainland drugs scene\". </p> <p>In a somewhat different approach to the problem of damning republicans while excusing the loyalist thugs, Dudley-Edwards' commentary in the Mail was a triumph of illogicality. The gangsters, she said were suffering from \"a feeling of statelessness and injustice\". They come from \"a strong tradition of dissent\" in which \"individualism is a key feature\" which makes \"unionism and loyalism... full of division\". This contrasts with republicans who \"flourish because they speak with the same voice in a way reminiscent of the Soviet Union\". </p> <p>But there was a more objective voice in the Times, pointing to the very real differences between the two traditions and offering a glimpse of the history, albeit partial, which every other writer overlooked. Simon Jenkins recalled the murderous 1973 Protestant uprising and the fact that down the years it is unionist paramilitaries who have been \"more terrifying\" than the IRA. In a wonderfully illuminating anecdote he wrote: \"Republican library books in the Maze were about politics and literature, loyalist ones about bodybuilding.\" </p> <p>In the Daily Express, where we were thankfully spared the Peter Hitchens viewpoint, there was another sensible piece by Cal McCrystal, who is certainly no republican. It was the loyalist ghettos, he wrote, where gangsterism, drug-pushing and prostitution were rife. </p> <p>But the overall picture painted by papers that gave the story space (did the Mirror really think six paragraphs on Adair's jailing served its readers?) was depressingly devoid of a truly historical perspective. The Mad Dogs and King Rats of the Protestant heartlands are not a new phenomenon. Their predecessors attacked the civil rights marchers and burned Catholic families from their homes in Belfast. It was the old IRA's failure to protect nationalists from these tartan gangs which led to the formation of the Provisionals, and the failure of the British troops (well, the British government) to recognise the true villains of the piece that led them into confrontation with the Provos. </p> <p>It was also the loyalist mobs who destroyed the government's 1974 attempt at power-sharing. No wonder British people routinely say of the northern Irish: \"They're all as bad as each other.\" That's what their papers keep telling them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's often said that, at their best, newspapers provide the first rough draft of history. What is too often overlooked is that, at their second-best, which is more normally the case anyway, papers deny the existence of history. There are many reasons, and the prime one is the most obvious: news is, by its very nature, immediate. It is, supposedly, new and different and it would be inappropriate to set every event in its historical context. News is also the main part of a commodity. It must help to sell the paper and would lose its commercial impact if its freshness was undermined by referring to the fact that it has happened before, is not really unique at all and, seen in that light, quite inconsequential. Giving readers a historical perspective takes up space and draws heavily on the time - and, of course, the expertise - of the journalist. It is therefore costly and, given the cult of youth that pervades so many papers nowadays, there are often too few people around editorial floors with a working knowledge of post-war modern history. Perhaps the most pernicious reason for our ahistorical press is its political agenda. When events call into question a policy line avidly pursued by a paper, throwing into doubt the trenchant \"advice\" offered to readers down the years, then it proves convenient to ignore history altogether. A combination of these factors, with the last undoubtedly the most prevalent, occurred in the coverage of loyalist gang warfare in Northern Ireland last week. Rightwing papers suddenly found themselves in a tricky situation because the story did not fit neatly into the previous 30-year pattern of events. In that paradigm, all the troubles in the \"province\" stemmed from malevolent republicans. In recent years, with the IRA ceasefire and Sinn Fein's incorporation into elected office, these papers have opened a second front by pouring scorn on the concept and the practice of the peace process. Yet the vast majority of republicans have remained stubbornly faithful to the ballot box, making it difficult for the hostile Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Times and Sun to continue with their anti-peace process propaganda war. Then along comes Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair and an opportunity of sorts is gratefully accepted. The usual suspects - Ruth Dudley-Edwards, Michael Gove, Bruce Anderson - were wheeled out along with their unnamed leader-writing sympathisers to hammer the government. The outbreak of internecine strife on the Shankill was, according to Anderson in the Mail, due to politicians having created \"a moral vacuum in which such madness can fester\". Gove in the Times blamed John Major and Tony Blair for appeasement. The Telegraph referred to the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, as living in an \"Alice in Wonderland world\" and claimed that Adair \"ruled the roost because of the Belfast agreement\". So far, so bad. Even on this single point, no historical context was allowed to peep through. No mention, for instance, of the people of Ireland having voted overwhelmingly for the agreement, which stated categorically that prisoners would be released. The Times, unlike the Telegraph, did at least praise Mandelson for Adair's arrest. But its columnist Gove led the way in offering a scandalous justification for the Protestant paramilitaries' gangsterism.Their hostility towards the peace process, he dared to claim, is fuelled by the fact that Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness is in government. And there, of course, is the return to the central agenda: it's all the uppity republicans' fault after all. The Daily Mail nodded in agreement, referring to \"the government's endless concessions to republicans\". The Sun, smoothly eliding loyalist gangs with the Provisionals, muddied the waters still further by asserting that \"the IRA runs its protection and drug rackets\". For years, journalists - and the RUC - have tried, and failed, to make this claim stick. Yet, without a shred of evidence, the Sun is happy to repeat the lie because, even with two loyalist gangs killing each other, it is important to remind readers of the main enemy. Similarly, a Telegraph leader informed us that \"some senior policemen... now believe that republican and loyalist paramilitaries could soon become big players... on the mainland drugs scene\". In a somewhat different approach to the problem of damning republicans while excusing the loyalist thugs, Dudley-Edwards' commentary in the Mail was a triumph of illogicality. The gangsters, she said were suffering from \"a feeling of statelessness and injustice\". They come from \"a strong tradition of dissent\" in which \"individualism is a key feature\" which makes \"unionism and loyalism... full of division\". This contrasts with republicans who \"flourish because they speak with the same voice in a way reminiscent of the Soviet Union\". But there was a more objective voice in the Times, pointing to the very real differences between the two traditions and offering a glimpse of the history, albeit partial, which every other writer overlooked. Simon Jenkins recalled the murderous 1973 Protestant uprising and the fact that down the years it is unionist paramilitaries who have been \"more terrifying\" than the IRA. In a wonderfully illuminating anecdote he wrote: \"Republican library books in the Maze were about politics and literature, loyalist ones about bodybuilding.\" In the Daily Express, where we were thankfully spared the Peter Hitchens viewpoint, there was another sensible piece by Cal McCrystal, who is certainly no republican. It was the loyalist ghettos, he wrote, where gangsterism, drug-pushing and prostitution were rife. But the overall picture painted by papers that gave the story space (did the Mirror really think six paragraphs on Adair's jailing served its readers?) was depressingly devoid of a truly historical perspective. The Mad Dogs and King Rats of the Protestant heartlands are not a new phenomenon. Their predecessors attacked the civil rights marchers and burned Catholic families from their homes in Belfast. It was the old IRA's failure to protect nationalists from these tartan gangs which led to the formation of the Provisionals, and the failure of the British troops (well, the British government) to recognise the true villains of the piece that led them into confrontation with the Provos. It was also the loyalist mobs who destroyed the government's 1974 attempt at power-sharing. No wonder British people routinely say of the northern Irish: \"They're all as bad as each other.\" That's what their papers keep telling them.",

      "body": "<p>The current phase of American capitalism began on November 9 1989, with the formal collapse of socialism. Since then, a lot of new technology has arrived to enhance market forces. The internet is one such technology. In a few short years, it has pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism - jobs for life; employee and customer loyalty; all for one and one for all - and replaced them with Lord knows what. </p> <p>Any time line that describes this phase of American capitalism would also have to include April 4 1994 (birth of Netscape), November 10 1994 (birth of Amazon.com), May 5 1996 (birth of eBay) - and August 4 1997. August 4 1997 was the beginning of the end of another socialistic force in American life: the mass market. Forty years from now, when your grandson asks you, \"Grandma, how did 50m Americans ever let themselves be talked into buying the same mouthwash?\" you will say, \"Well, you have to know how things were before August 4 1997.\" </p> <p>This was the day a pair of Silicon Valley engineers named Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay started their own technology company with several million dollars from a pair of venture capital firms. Barton and Ramsay's first idea was to turn the American home into a network, but, after a few months, they went back to their venture capitalists and told them that home networking was a bad idea because they couldn't explain it to anyone but other geeks. They had another idea, though. Instead of transforming the entire American home, they decided to focus on the television. </p> <p>Barton had become obsessed with the television a few years earlier, when working at Silicon Graphics. He helped to build the only interactive television that actually worked, installed in late 1994 by Time Warner in 4,000 homes in Orlando, Florida, and then watched in dismay as his beloved project was overrun by the internet. The internet did a fraction of what the new TVs promised, but at a fraction of the price. </p> <p>Like many smart engineers, Bar ton is a man used to figuring things out. The TV gnawed at him because he didn't have the answer. The box worked. And yet no one cared. There were several lessons in this: </p> <p><strong> No 1 </strong> Brilliant gadgets for a mass market do not go anywhere if the masses cannot afford them. </p> <p><strong> No 2</strong> A big company is not necessarily the best place to create a revolutionary technology. </p> <p><strong> No 3</strong> The whims of the American consumer are the eighth wonder of the world. They can wreak havoc with the most powerful establishments. </p> <p>When Barton and Ramsay returned to the television, they devised another black box, one with a memory. Far simpler to programme than a VCR, it was also considerably more versatile. The viewer could record programming. Or he could simply tell the box to go out and find him the kind of programmes he liked. If he liked indiscreet women, he could record and store every episode of Sex and the City. If he liked intelligent blood and guts, he didn't need to wait until TNT's Clint Eastwood week - he could just instruct his box to fetch Clint Eastwood movies as they played. The viewer's only constraint on choice was that the programme had to be broadcast by someone, sometime. </p> <p>The black box also enabled the viewer to treat all television - even live television - as television he had recorded for his own private use. All he would need to do is start watching a programme a few minutes after it began. Then, by pressing a button, he could skip the credits, the time-outs, the weather and all the other boring stretches of television designed by producers to lull viewers into watching ads. He could also skip the ads. </p> <p>Over time, the viewer would create his own private TV channel, stored on a hard drive in the black box, tailored with great precision to his interests. When someone asked Barton or Ramsay, \"Tell me again what this gadget does?\" they now had a simple answer: \"It lets you watch anything you want to watch when you want to watch it.\" </p> <p>There was one other cool thing the box could do. While the viewer watched the television, the box would watch the viewer. The viewer's every decision would be stored in a kind of private museum of whims. Over time, the box would come to know what the viewer liked - maybe even better than the viewer himself. All by itself, it would record shows it calculated the viewer might like. The box was more than a box, it was a butler, and the more it learned about its master's whims, the more it would be able to fetch what its master wanted. </p> <p>Calling their company TiVo, Ramsay, 50, the chief executive officer, and Barton, 42, the chief technology officer, knew the box was not where the money was - the box was, in fact, a big money loser. To kick-start the market they would need to pay an electronics company to make the boxes and sell them below cost. The trick was to get as many into American homes as possible. TiVo's programming software would arrive in millions of homes either with existing cable boxes or, in the future, embedded in new TV sets, cable boxes or satellite receivers. The long-term goal was to become unnecessary. \"We'll know we've succeeded when the TiVo box vanishes,\" Barton says. </p> <p>The ambition of the enterprise was breathtaking. The company intended to plop itself down between the 102m TV homes and the $50bn TV industry. Once the box was in place, TiVo would be the hub of the TV industry. The company would know the subtle preferences of every viewer. It could then charge a fee to anyone who wanted to locate groups of viewers: networks, cable companies, advertisers. The trick was to get the box into those 102m homes - and that would cost money. Lots of money. Ramsay told the venture capitalists they needed to lose $300-400m before they became profitable. Prior to the internet boom, capitalists were chary about sinking one-tenth of that sum into a small, risky venture; now, says Ramsey,\"instead of saying, 'No,' they said, 'Great.' \" </p> <p>What made this enthusiasm even more astonishing was that a rival company had already sprung up. Anthony Wood, a young computer game entrepreneur, stumbled on the same idea at roughly the same time. Wood had been frustrated by his VCR's failure to record episodes of his favourite show, Star Trek. In early 1998, not long after Barton and Ramsay got their first financing, Wood generously agreed to accept $8m from venture capitalists. He called his new company Replay Networks (later Replay TV). </p> <p>By March 1999, the first TiVo and Replay boxes had already been shipped. By June this year, the companies had sold about 100,000 boxes between them, largely without advertising. Several market analysts estimate that they will have sold 5-7m boxes by the end of 2002 - and that, within a decade, they will be in 90m homes. There's room for them to coexist happily. They're seizing control of a $50bn industry from its creators; there's more than enough booty to go around. Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, who invested his own money in Replay, calls it \"the Trojan horse for the computer industry\", offering it the opportunity \"to gain control of the entertainment industry.\" </p> <p>The new companies threaten to do politely to the TV industry what Napster did to the music industry: help consumers to help themselves to entertainment without \"paying\" the networks and advertisers. Naturally, this disturbs the networks and advertisers. </p> <p>\"The one question our investors did ask us,\" Ramsay says, \"is, 'How long will it take for the TV networks to hate you so much that they shut you down?' \" Talk to people at TiVo and Replay, and in the networks and ad firms, and you realise there is an official story and a true story. The official story, believed by practically no one, is that these boxes won't destroy the TV industry as we know it; they'll merely enable its current rulers to make it an even better place. </p> <p>To persuade the networks of this pleasant notion, TiVo had to play down a lot of what made their box desirable to a consumer. Instead of a button for skipping commercials, for instance, Barton designed a fast-forward button with three speeds, enabling the TiVo user to speed through the ads but not skip them entirely. Replay TV at first viewed the networks' interests as irrelevant: its remote control has a \"QuickSkip\" button, which lets the viewer leap ahead in increments of 30 seconds, the length of a typical TV commercial. </p> <p>But when Kim LeMasters, formerly of CBS, replaced Wood as Replay's CEO, he struck a much more conciliatory note. Though he wasn't able to scrap QuickSkip, he said he would not promote the feature. So both the companies now argue to the networks that a device that steals their power and hands it to consumers is actually good for them. </p> <p>They make two points. The first is that several new accessories that promised a revolution have already appeared - the VCR, the remote control, cable TV - only to be assimilated without greatly disrupting the existing social order. The other point is that the box encourages people to watch even more television. This prospect may cast doubt on the future of intelligent life, but it should, in theory, be good for TV networks. Replay now has data proving that its new customers watch, on average, three hours more television each week. </p> <p>That's the official story. But it becomes less plausible every day, thanks to the information piling up inside TiVo and Replay about how ordinary people use their boxes. They use them to undermine, with ruthless precision, the interests of TV networks and mass-market advertisers. They have two distinctly unsettling new habits. The first is that they don't watch scheduled TV any more. According to Josh Bernoff, a TV industry analyst with Forrester Research, viewers \"get into the habit of not paying attention to when the programmes are on and just watch what they've recorded\". </p> <p>Well. If it doesn't matter when programmes run, then the whole concept of prime time - and its special market value - vanishes. Ditto the idea of pitting one show against another by virtue of its time slot. In the age of black boxes, every show ever broadcast competes against every other show for the viewer's attention; for this reason, whatever advantage a network has in the development of new TV shows disappears. </p> <p>But that isn't the worst news that TiVo and Replay have for the networks. The worst news is that no one watches commercials anymore. Eighty-eight per cent - 88%! - of the ads in the programmes seen by viewers on their black boxes went unwatched. If no one watches commercials, then there is no commercial television. </p> <p>And yet - and here is the punch line - the networks have done nothing but encourage the new technology. By the end of 1999, all three major US television networks, along with most major Hollywood studios, the two biggest Hollywood talent agencies (ICM and CAA) and all the major cable and satellite TV companies, had either made investments in or formed partnerships with both Replay and TiVo. </p> <p>\"A lot of these guys had their bell rung four years ago by the internet,\" says Steve Shannon of Replay, \"and they don't want to be humiliated a second time.\" The internet gave birth to a new corporate religion to replace the one it killed. The religion says: change is inevitable. The question now being posed by the TV establishment - and it emerges from the belly of the beast as a weak burp rather than a loud blast - is no longer \"Will this gadget eventually change how Americans watch TV?\" but \"When this gadget changes how Americans watch television, what else will it change?\" </p> <p>A lot. </p> <p>The black box means the end of commercial television as we know it. It poses two questions that demand a response from the TV industry. The first is: how do you get people to watch ads when, with a button, they can eliminate them? The sad truth about ads is that people really didn't ask to see them; people are just too lazy to avoid them. The box puts an end to that racket. Either the ads will need to become as entertaining as the programmes or the programmes will need to contain the ads, so that they cannot be stripped out. If Jennifer Aniston wants to remain a Friend, she may need to don a T-shirt that says \"Diet Coke\". </p> <p>Television advertising is currently based on data measuring how many households tune in to a programme, not how many watch the ads. But the TiVo and Replay boxes accumulate, in atomic detail, a record of who watched what and when they watched it. Put the box in all 102m homes, and you get a pointillist portrait of the entire US TV audience. And that raises the second and more disturbing question for the TV industry: what do you do when you actually know who is watching and why? </p> <p>Already, TiVo and Replay know what each of their users does every second. And they will know, in great detail, the viewer's interests. An audience of 200,000 people you know intimately might be as valuable as an amorphous mass of 20m. After all, a person with a deep interest in a subject is more likely to watch an ad about that subject. \"You and I may not care to watch a commercial for Preparation H,\" Josh Bernoff says. \"But for someone with haemorrhoids, it might be the thing he is most eager to hear about. And he's the one the makers of Preparation H want to talk to.\" </p> <p>\"This technology will encourage all sorts of niche brands,\" says Barton, \"as well as whole new markets.\" His favourite example is the hockey channel. Everyone interested in it can punch \"hockey\" into their box, and it will find and record any hockey programme. At the moment, there isn't much hockey on the tube; that will change. The maker of the new hockey shows will rent cheap time - at, say, 4am - to broadcast. Hockey enthusiasts will simply record the shows. And, voil\u00e0, a new business is born. \"The business is two guys,\" Barton says. \"One acquires hockey content. The other calls people who make hockey equipment.\" </p> <p>The same slice-'em-and-dice-'em logic applies even to such seemingly mass market events as the Super Bowl. Once the box is ubiquitous, an advertiser need not buy the whole audience; he can buy a piece of the audience. General Motors may still buy time during the Super Bowl, but the company will probably use the time differently. GM might use its 30 seconds to distribute 50 different commercials to 50 different clusters of consumers. Soccer moms will see ads for people movers, middle-aged people will see ads for sports cars, and so on. </p> <p>But even that is a retrograde example. The operative unit in TV ratings will no longer be the programme but the moment. Advertisers and networks will know with weird accuracy who and what within each programme best holds viewers' attention. The box can determine which joke in Letterman's monologue prompted viewers to switch to Leno or which medical emergency inspired viewers to exit ER. (If you thought the pressure on entertainers to be perpetually entertaining couldn't increase, think again.) </p> <p>Many things will change when television is able to whisper finely tuned messages to like-minded consumers rather than hollering crude messages at millions. The hollerers - such as GM and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the two largest buyers of US airtime - are in trouble, for a start. The TV is the mass market. Without the TV, there never would have been Daz or Rice Krispies, but a thousand versions of Daz and Rice Krispies. For the big brands, life without TV is no life at all. </p> <p>Giant corporations whose sole purpose is to mass-market consumer goods exist in their current form because television shaped the mass market. If television ceases to be a mass market, the mass market largely ceases to exist. The question isn't just, \"How does P&amp;G sell soap powder now?\" but \"How does it survive?\" It must transform itself from a maker of mass-market goods into the world's largest boutique. After all, the consumer would obviously prefer that not only the message be precisely tailored but the products as well. In this new market, there will either be hundreds of versions of Daz or no Daz at all. </p> <p>But why stop there? It isn't just the mass market that is crude and inefficient and therefore ripe for re-evaluation; it is Market Man himself. Instead of grouping the consumer by observable traits over which he has little or no control - age, race, gender - the new market will know him by his decisions about how to spend his time, every moment of which is recorded by his box. Getting inside a consumer's mind so as to get inside his wallet, TiVo or Replay will be able to present some mass-market company trying desperately to stay alive with 40,000 consumers classified as People Who Live for Onions. </p> <p>Nick Donatiello of market-research company Odyssey says that the box - along with the internet - makes it likely that ads will be tailored not to outward characteristics but to consumers' more fundamental attitudes. GM will run one commercial, perhaps, for people with a tragic view of life and another for people with a comic view of life. \"In the 50s, you could tell a lot of things about a person if you knew where he lived,\" says Donatiello. \"You can't do that any more. We've become too fragmented and autonomous a society.\" </p> <p>The mass market put a price not on individual states of mind but on the average state of mind of commercially very different people. It did this because it made no economic sense to parse in microscopic detail what every one of us did with our attention and why we did it. And so the market just lumped us together and assumed we all paid more or less the same attention. </p> <p>Now, suddenly, the technology has appeared that can unravel the collective. Maybe the best way to see what is about to happen is to observe what has happened already. To some extent, ads have become more like entertainment, and TV programming has moved in the direction in which it is about to be shoved much, much further. </p> <p>The few events that really benefit from being watched live - sports and awards and sensational unfolding news - have a greater gravitational pull, and a greater market value, than ever. Synthetic events like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Big Brother and Survivor are prescient, for they involve the viewer as a quasi-participant and require the actual participants to deploy many vendable goods, thereby offering sparkling opportunities for product placement. In a \"real\" world, real goods are more naturally introduced than in a purely fictional one. </p> <p>The new black box is really just a fantastically powerful accelerator of the fragmentation of markets caused by non-terrestrial TV and the internet. Already there's some rumbling in the netherworld of advertising and marketing that suggests it is preparing itself for the coming earthquake. Starcom now classifies TV audiences not by demographics but by something it calls \"passion groups\"; P&amp;G's website Reflect.com enables shoppers to create their own beauty products - a harbinger of an age in which every consumer will demand products tailored to him alone.

      "bodyText": "The current phase of American capitalism began on November 9 1989, with the formal collapse of socialism. Since then, a lot of new technology has arrived to enhance market forces. The internet is one such technology. In a few short years, it has pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism - jobs for life; employee and customer loyalty; all for one and one for all - and replaced them with Lord knows what. Any time line that describes this phase of American capitalism would also have to include April 4 1994 (birth of Netscape), November 10 1994 (birth of Amazon.com), May 5 1996 (birth of eBay) - and August 4 1997. August 4 1997 was the beginning of the end of another socialistic force in American life: the mass market. Forty years from now, when your grandson asks you, \"Grandma, how did 50m Americans ever let themselves be talked into buying the same mouthwash?\" you will say, \"Well, you have to know how things were before August 4 1997.\" This was the day a pair of Silicon Valley engineers named Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay started their own technology company with several million dollars from a pair of venture capital firms. Barton and Ramsay's first idea was to turn the American home into a network, but, after a few months, they went back to their venture capitalists and told them that home networking was a bad idea because they couldn't explain it to anyone but other geeks. They had another idea, though. Instead of transforming the entire American home, they decided to focus on the television. Barton had become obsessed with the television a few years earlier, when working at Silicon Graphics. He helped to build the only interactive television that actually worked, installed in late 1994 by Time Warner in 4,000 homes in Orlando, Florida, and then watched in dismay as his beloved project was overrun by the internet. The internet did a fraction of what the new TVs promised, but at a fraction of the price. Like many smart engineers, Bar ton is a man used to figuring things out. The TV gnawed at him because he didn't have the answer. The box worked. And yet no one cared. There were several lessons in this: No 1 Brilliant gadgets for a mass market do not go anywhere if the masses cannot afford them. No 2 A big company is not necessarily the best place to create a revolutionary technology. No 3 The whims of the American consumer are the eighth wonder of the world. They can wreak havoc with the most powerful establishments. When Barton and Ramsay returned to the television, they devised another black box, one with a memory. Far simpler to programme than a VCR, it was also considerably more versatile. The viewer could record programming. Or he could simply tell the box to go out and find him the kind of programmes he liked. If he liked indiscreet women, he could record and store every episode of Sex and the City. If he liked intelligent blood and guts, he didn't need to wait until TNT's Clint Eastwood week - he could just instruct his box to fetch Clint Eastwood movies as they played. The viewer's only constraint on choice was that the programme had to be broadcast by someone, sometime. The black box also enabled the viewer to treat all television - even live television - as television he had recorded for his own private use. All he would need to do is start watching a programme a few minutes after it began. Then, by pressing a button, he could skip the credits, the time-outs, the weather and all the other boring stretches of television designed by producers to lull viewers into watching ads. He could also skip the ads. Over time, the viewer would create his own private TV channel, stored on a hard drive in the black box, tailored with great precision to his interests. When someone asked Barton or Ramsay, \"Tell me again what this gadget does?\" they now had a simple answer: \"It lets you watch anything you want to watch when you want to watch it.\" There was one other cool thing the box could do. While the viewer watched the television, the box would watch the viewer. The viewer's every decision would be stored in a kind of private museum of whims. Over time, the box would come to know what the viewer liked - maybe even better than the viewer himself. All by itself, it would record shows it calculated the viewer might like. The box was more than a box, it was a butler, and the more it learned about its master's whims, the more it would be able to fetch what its master wanted. Calling their company TiVo, Ramsay, 50, the chief executive officer, and Barton, 42, the chief technology officer, knew the box was not where the money was - the box was, in fact, a big money loser. To kick-start the market they would need to pay an electronics company to make the boxes and sell them below cost. The trick was to get as many into American homes as possible. TiVo's programming software would arrive in millions of homes either with existing cable boxes or, in the future, embedded in new TV sets, cable boxes or satellite receivers. The long-term goal was to become unnecessary. \"We'll know we've succeeded when the TiVo box vanishes,\" Barton says. The ambition of the enterprise was breathtaking. The company intended to plop itself down between the 102m TV homes and the $50bn TV industry. Once the box was in place, TiVo would be the hub of the TV industry. The company would know the subtle preferences of every viewer. It could then charge a fee to anyone who wanted to locate groups of viewers: networks, cable companies, advertisers. The trick was to get the box into those 102m homes - and that would cost money. Lots of money. Ramsay told the venture capitalists they needed to lose $300-400m before they became profitable. Prior to the internet boom, capitalists were chary about sinking one-tenth of that sum into a small, risky venture; now, says Ramsey,\"instead of saying, 'No,' they said, 'Great.' \" What made this enthusiasm even more astonishing was that a rival company had already sprung up. Anthony Wood, a young computer game entrepreneur, stumbled on the same idea at roughly the same time. Wood had been frustrated by his VCR's failure to record episodes of his favourite show, Star Trek. In early 1998, not long after Barton and Ramsay got their first financing, Wood generously agreed to accept $8m from venture capitalists. He called his new company Replay Networks (later Replay TV). By March 1999, the first TiVo and Replay boxes had already been shipped. By June this year, the companies had sold about 100,000 boxes between them, largely without advertising. Several market analysts estimate that they will have sold 5-7m boxes by the end of 2002 - and that, within a decade, they will be in 90m homes. There's room for them to coexist happily. They're seizing control of a $50bn industry from its creators; there's more than enough booty to go around. Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, who invested his own money in Replay, calls it \"the Trojan horse for the computer industry\", offering it the opportunity \"to gain control of the entertainment industry.\" The new companies threaten to do politely to the TV industry what Napster did to the music industry: help consumers to help themselves to entertainment without \"paying\" the networks and advertisers. Naturally, this disturbs the networks and advertisers. \"The one question our investors did ask us,\" Ramsay says, \"is, 'How long will it take for the TV networks to hate you so much that they shut you down?' \" Talk to people at TiVo and Replay, and in the networks and ad firms, and you realise there is an official story and a true story. The official story, believed by practically no one, is that these boxes won't destroy the TV industry as we know it; they'll merely enable its current rulers to make it an even better place. To persuade the networks of this pleasant notion, TiVo had to play down a lot of what made their box desirable to a consumer. Instead of a button for skipping commercials, for instance, Barton designed a fast-forward button with three speeds, enabling the TiVo user to speed through the ads but not skip them entirely. Replay TV at first viewed the networks' interests as irrelevant: its remote control has a \"QuickSkip\" button, which lets the viewer leap ahead in increments of 30 seconds, the length of a typical TV commercial. But when Kim LeMasters, formerly of CBS, replaced Wood as Replay's CEO, he struck a much more conciliatory note. Though he wasn't able to scrap QuickSkip, he said he would not promote the feature. So both the companies now argue to the networks that a device that steals their power and hands it to consumers is actually good for them. They make two points. The first is that several new accessories that promised a revolution have already appeared - the VCR, the remote control, cable TV - only to be assimilated without greatly disrupting the existing social order. The other point is that the box encourages people to watch even more television. This prospect may cast doubt on the future of intelligent life, but it should, in theory, be good for TV networks. Replay now has data proving that its new customers watch, on average, three hours more television each week. That's the official story. But it becomes less plausible every day, thanks to the information piling up inside TiVo and Replay about how ordinary people use their boxes. They use them to undermine, with ruthless precision, the interests of TV networks and mass-market advertisers. They have two distinctly unsettling new habits. The first is that they don't watch scheduled TV any more. According to Josh Bernoff, a TV industry analyst with Forrester Research, viewers \"get into the habit of not paying attention to when the programmes are on and just watch what they've recorded\". Well. If it doesn't matter when programmes run, then the whole concept of prime time - and its special market value - vanishes. Ditto the idea of pitting one show against another by virtue of its time slot. In the age of black boxes, every show ever broadcast competes against every other show for the viewer's attention; for this reason, whatever advantage a network has in the development of new TV shows disappears. But that isn't the worst news that TiVo and Replay have for the networks. The worst news is that no one watches commercials anymore. Eighty-eight per cent - 88%! - of the ads in the programmes seen by viewers on their black boxes went unwatched. If no one watches commercials, then there is no commercial television. And yet - and here is the punch line - the networks have done nothing but encourage the new technology. By the end of 1999, all three major US television networks, along with most major Hollywood studios, the two biggest Hollywood talent agencies (ICM and CAA) and all the major cable and satellite TV companies, had either made investments in or formed partnerships with both Replay and TiVo. \"A lot of these guys had their bell rung four years ago by the internet,\" says Steve Shannon of Replay, \"and they don't want to be humiliated a second time.\" The internet gave birth to a new corporate religion to replace the one it killed. The religion says: change is inevitable. The question now being posed by the TV establishment - and it emerges from the belly of the beast as a weak burp rather than a loud blast - is no longer \"Will this gadget eventually change how Americans watch TV?\" but \"When this gadget changes how Americans watch television, what else will it change?\" A lot. The black box means the end of commercial television as we know it. It poses two questions that demand a response from the TV industry. The first is: how do you get people to watch ads when, with a button, they can eliminate them? The sad truth about ads is that people really didn't ask to see them; people are just too lazy to avoid them. The box puts an end to that racket. Either the ads will need to become as entertaining as the programmes or the programmes will need to contain the ads, so that they cannot be stripped out. If Jennifer Aniston wants to remain a Friend, she may need to don a T-shirt that says \"Diet Coke\". Television advertising is currently based on data measuring how many households tune in to a programme, not how many watch the ads. But the TiVo and Replay boxes accumulate, in atomic detail, a record of who watched what and when they watched it. Put the box in all 102m homes, and you get a pointillist portrait of the entire US TV audience. And that raises the second and more disturbing question for the TV industry: what do you do when you actually know who is watching and why? Already, TiVo and Replay know what each of their users does every second. And they will know, in great detail, the viewer's interests. An audience of 200,000 people you know intimately might be as valuable as an amorphous mass of 20m. After all, a person with a deep interest in a subject is more likely to watch an ad about that subject. \"You and I may not care to watch a commercial for Preparation H,\" Josh Bernoff says. \"But for someone with haemorrhoids, it might be the thing he is most eager to hear about. And he's the one the makers of Preparation H want to talk to.\" \"This technology will encourage all sorts of niche brands,\" says Barton, \"as well as whole new markets.\" His favourite example is the hockey channel. Everyone interested in it can punch \"hockey\" into their box, and it will find and record any hockey programme. At the moment, there isn't much hockey on the tube; that will change. The maker of the new hockey shows will rent cheap time - at, say, 4am - to broadcast. Hockey enthusiasts will simply record the shows. And, voil\u00e0, a new business is born. \"The business is two guys,\" Barton says. \"One acquires hockey content. The other calls people who make hockey equipment.\" The same slice-'em-and-dice-'em logic applies even to such seemingly mass market events as the Super Bowl. Once the box is ubiquitous, an advertiser need not buy the whole audience; he can buy a piece of the audience. General Motors may still buy time during the Super Bowl, but the company will probably use the time differently. GM might use its 30 seconds to distribute 50 different commercials to 50 different clusters of consumers. Soccer moms will see ads for people movers, middle-aged people will see ads for sports cars, and so on. But even that is a retrograde example. The operative unit in TV ratings will no longer be the programme but the moment. Advertisers and networks will know with weird accuracy who and what within each programme best holds viewers' attention. The box can determine which joke in Letterman's monologue prompted viewers to switch to Leno or which medical emergency inspired viewers to exit ER. (If you thought the pressure on entertainers to be perpetually entertaining couldn't increase, think again.) Many things will change when television is able to whisper finely tuned messages to like-minded consumers rather than hollering crude messages at millions. The hollerers - such as GM and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the two largest buyers of US airtime - are in trouble, for a start. The TV is the mass market. Without the TV, there never would have been Daz or Rice Krispies, but a thousand versions of Daz and Rice Krispies. For the big brands, life without TV is no life at all. Giant corporations whose sole purpose is to mass-market consumer goods exist in their current form because television shaped the mass market. If television ceases to be a mass market, the mass market largely ceases to exist. The question isn't just, \"How does P&amp;G sell soap powder now?\" but \"How does it survive?\" It must transform itself from a maker of mass-market goods into the world's largest boutique. After all, the consumer would obviously prefer that not only the message be precisely tailored but the products as well. In this new market, there will either be hundreds of versions of Daz or no Daz at all. But why stop there? It isn't just the mass market that is crude and inefficient and therefore ripe for re-evaluation; it is Market Man himself. Instead of grouping the consumer by observable traits over which he has little or no control - age, race, gender - the new market will know him by his decisions about how to spend his time, every moment of which is recorded by his box. Getting inside a consumer's mind so as to get inside his wallet, TiVo or Replay will be able to present some mass-market company trying desperately to stay alive with 40,000 consumers classified as People Who Live for Onions. Nick Donatiello of market-research company Odyssey says that the box - along with the internet - makes it likely that ads will be tailored not to outward characteristics but to consumers' more fundamental attitudes. GM will run one commercial, perhaps, for people with a tragic view of life and another for people with a comic view of life. \"In the 50s, you could tell a lot of things about a person if you knew where he lived,\" says Donatiello. \"You can't do that any more. We've become too fragmented and autonomous a society.\" The mass market put a price not on individual states of mind but on the average state of mind of commercially very different people. It did this because it made no economic sense to parse in microscopic detail what every one of us did with our attention and why we did it. And so the market just lumped us together and assumed we all paid more or less the same attention. Now, suddenly, the technology has appeared that can unravel the collective. Maybe the best way to see what is about to happen is to observe what has happened already. To some extent, ads have become more like entertainment, and TV programming has moved in the direction in which it is about to be shoved much, much further. The few events that really benefit from being watched live - sports and awards and sensational unfolding news - have a greater gravitational pull, and a greater market value, than ever. Synthetic events like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Big Brother and Survivor are prescient, for they involve the viewer as a quasi-participant and require the actual participants to deploy many vendable goods, thereby offering sparkling opportunities for product placement. In a \"real\" world, real goods are more naturally introduced than in a purely fictional one. The new black box is really just a fantastically powerful accelerator of the fragmentation of markets caused by non-terrestrial TV and the internet. Already there's some rumbling in the netherworld of advertising and marketing that suggests it is preparing itself for the coming earthquake. Starcom now classifies TV audiences not by demographics but by something it calls \"passion groups\"; P&amp;G's website Reflect.com enables shoppers to create their own beauty products - a harbinger of an age in which every consumer will demand products tailored to him alone. The theme of all this is that groups are narrower and defined by interests and that the ultimate interest is... Me! The main thing about Me! is that he always gets what he wants, or at any rate what he thinks he wants. Nick Donatiello argues that the box is ideally suited for American life as it is currently configured, when consumer choice has been exalted to a fetish. \"If you had offered Americans this box 30 years ago,\" he says, \"they wouldn't have had the same reaction.

      "body": "<p>Tony Garnett, the godfather of British television drama, has a knack for producing work that taps into the spirit of the times. From the ground-breaking 1960s social realism of Cathy Come Home to This Life, with its cast of mid-1990s twentysomethings more into partying than politics, Garnett has been closely associated with era-defining drama. </p> <p>Now, just as viewers are coming to terms with how traditional TV can be enhanced by the internet, Garnett's company, World Productions, is putting the finishing touches to a new BBC2 drama with a website designed to play an integral part in an interactive viewing experience. Attachments, which is due to debut on BBC 2 next month, is - appropriately enough - set in a fictional dot.com start-up. The accompanying website will carry content that changes and develops to mirror events in the 10-part TV series. </p> <p>The controller of BBC2, Jane Root, says that when she and Garnett began discussing a follow-up to his previous series, The Cops, he had in mind from the outset a TV drama about people working in an internet-related environment, with a significant interactive element. (Garnett maintained his customary reticence and was not available to discuss the new show.) </p> <p>\"To have Tony, one of the major TV drama figures of our generation, working on this is quite a coming-of-age moment,\" Root declares. \"There's something in common with what happened when the first lightweight 16mm cameras came out and location filming became easier. It provides the chance to create a different visual language.\" </p> <p>Attachments centres on the efforts of Mike and his wife Luce to transform his new music website, seethru.co.uk, from a bedroom hobby into a viable internet content business offering news, reviews and gossip. Frazzled dot.com executives will recognise the couple's struggle to secure venture capital funding without having to give away too much control of their fledgling company. </p> <p>Those lower down the new economy food chain will be able to identify with an internet start-up office divided along content writer versus techie versus programmer versus designer social faultlines. They will also recognise the long periods idled away playing computer games and emailing mates, punctuated by short bursts of frenzied, work-through-the-night activity as deadlines loom. </p> <p>Root is keen to emphasise that the programme has a universal focus on people and relationships in the modern workplace and is not an obscure tale about webheads. She quotes recent research suggesting that the office is now the place where most people meet their life partner. There is also a sense of Attachments being the older sibling of This Life, with central characters moving beyond the mad-for-it hedonism of their early 20s and making serious decisions about their lives and careers. </p> <p>Fans of Garnett's recent BBC2 work, such as This Life and The Cops, will spot plenty of familiar touches. The young and largely unknown cast, for starters. Attachments dispenses with the handheld documentary style of The Cops, but is fast-paced and has similarly been shot using a single camera. There is also an attention-grabbing opening scene, with sex and full-frontal male nudity. On a skateboard. </p> <p>However, providing an interactive element is a completely new departure for Garnett. He has brought together an in-house web production team, led by technical advisers Paul Lakin and David McCandless, which is working closely with the Attachments TV programme-makers at World. Root says that the idea is for the website to feel as though it has been created by the fictional characters from the drama. </p> <p>Seethru.co.uk is being built to operate as a stand-alone content website, with all the features anyone who comes across it while surfing the net and has never seen the TV show would expect. But Attachments fans will be able to visit the site and look at articles that feature in the unfolding TV drama, in many cases getting to read something that is only mentioned or seen in passing. They can email characters from the drama and listen to the music of real unsigned artists through seethru.co.uk. </p> <p>The fictional seethru office is also fitted with webcams, allowing viewers to have another look at footage from the show as well as extra material not seen on TV. Net users will be able to check out footage relating to the cliffhanger ending to the first episode, for instance, which takes place in the office toilet. </p> <p>The seethru site will go live when the first episode goes out, with the standards waxing and waning after that according to the fortunes of the fictional web business. So at the outset users will log on to the amateurish site that Mike has been running from his bedroom. The internet offering will get a more professional feel when funding is secured in the drama, but the quality will also deteriorate again at times of crisis during the series. </p> <p>Root stresses that Attachments is intended to work as a stand-alone TV show, with the viewing audience still the primary focus. But it has also been created to appeal to \"v-users\" - people who experience the drama through their PC screens. Anything that provokes rows or controversy in the drama will disappear from the seethru site at the exact same moment as it is fictionally deleted, according to Root. </p> <p>\"There will be lots of people watching and arguing about things - stuff that's on the webcams, that people have written - who can go and see it on the internet after the show,\" she says. \"I hope people who contact the site will be able to have a role on it.\" </p> <p>Attachments was commissioned last year, before the internet start-up boom - and the headline-grabbing trend for making people overnight dot.com millionaires - reached its surreal, get-rich-quick peak and turned into a crash. </p> <p>But Root is still confident that Garnett has not for once missed the boat. She has already commissioned a second 10-part run of Attachments. </p> <p>\"I rather like the fact that it all started to go wrong. It's more dramatic,\" she says. \"If people were still effortlessly becoming internet millionaires, there would be less dramatic potential. There is now more awareness of the pressures and the possibility of failure - that's more potent.\" </p> <p> <strong>Recognise anybody from your new media office?</strong></p> <p><strong> Mike (Justin Pierre):</strong> seethru.co.uk founder.

      "bodyText": "Tony Garnett, the godfather of British television drama, has a knack for producing work that taps into the spirit of the times. From the ground-breaking 1960s social realism of Cathy Come Home to This Life, with its cast of mid-1990s twentysomethings more into partying than politics, Garnett has been closely associated with era-defining drama. Now, just as viewers are coming to terms with how traditional TV can be enhanced by the internet, Garnett's company, World Productions, is putting the finishing touches to a new BBC2 drama with a website designed to play an integral part in an interactive viewing experience. Attachments, which is due to debut on BBC 2 next month, is - appropriately enough - set in a fictional dot.com start-up. The accompanying website will carry content that changes and develops to mirror events in the 10-part TV series. The controller of BBC2, Jane Root, says that when she and Garnett began discussing a follow-up to his previous series, The Cops, he had in mind from the outset a TV drama about people working in an internet-related environment, with a significant interactive element. (Garnett maintained his customary reticence and was not available to discuss the new show.) \"To have Tony, one of the major TV drama figures of our generation, working on this is quite a coming-of-age moment,\" Root declares. \"There's something in common with what happened when the first lightweight 16mm cameras came out and location filming became easier. It provides the chance to create a different visual language.\" Attachments centres on the efforts of Mike and his wife Luce to transform his new music website, seethru.co.uk, from a bedroom hobby into a viable internet content business offering news, reviews and gossip. Frazzled dot.com executives will recognise the couple's struggle to secure venture capital funding without having to give away too much control of their fledgling company. Those lower down the new economy food chain will be able to identify with an internet start-up office divided along content writer versus techie versus programmer versus designer social faultlines. They will also recognise the long periods idled away playing computer games and emailing mates, punctuated by short bursts of frenzied, work-through-the-night activity as deadlines loom. Root is keen to emphasise that the programme has a universal focus on people and relationships in the modern workplace and is not an obscure tale about webheads. She quotes recent research suggesting that the office is now the place where most people meet their life partner. There is also a sense of Attachments being the older sibling of This Life, with central characters moving beyond the mad-for-it hedonism of their early 20s and making serious decisions about their lives and careers. Fans of Garnett's recent BBC2 work, such as This Life and The Cops, will spot plenty of familiar touches. The young and largely unknown cast, for starters. Attachments dispenses with the handheld documentary style of The Cops, but is fast-paced and has similarly been shot using a single camera. There is also an attention-grabbing opening scene, with sex and full-frontal male nudity. On a skateboard. However, providing an interactive element is a completely new departure for Garnett. He has brought together an in-house web production team, led by technical advisers Paul Lakin and David McCandless, which is working closely with the Attachments TV programme-makers at World. Root says that the idea is for the website to feel as though it has been created by the fictional characters from the drama. Seethru.co.uk is being built to operate as a stand-alone content website, with all the features anyone who comes across it while surfing the net and has never seen the TV show would expect. But Attachments fans will be able to visit the site and look at articles that feature in the unfolding TV drama, in many cases getting to read something that is only mentioned or seen in passing. They can email characters from the drama and listen to the music of real unsigned artists through seethru.co.uk. The fictional seethru office is also fitted with webcams, allowing viewers to have another look at footage from the show as well as extra material not seen on TV. Net users will be able to check out footage relating to the cliffhanger ending to the first episode, for instance, which takes place in the office toilet. The seethru site will go live when the first episode goes out, with the standards waxing and waning after that according to the fortunes of the fictional web business. So at the outset users will log on to the amateurish site that Mike has been running from his bedroom. The internet offering will get a more professional feel when funding is secured in the drama, but the quality will also deteriorate again at times of crisis during the series. Root stresses that Attachments is intended to work as a stand-alone TV show, with the viewing audience still the primary focus. But it has also been created to appeal to \"v-users\" - people who experience the drama through their PC screens. Anything that provokes rows or controversy in the drama will disappear from the seethru site at the exact same moment as it is fictionally deleted, according to Root. \"There will be lots of people watching and arguing about things - stuff that's on the webcams, that people have written - who can go and see it on the internet after the show,\" she says. \"I hope people who contact the site will be able to have a role on it.\" Attachments was commissioned last year, before the internet start-up boom - and the headline-grabbing trend for making people overnight dot.com millionaires - reached its surreal, get-rich-quick peak and turned into a crash. But Root is still confident that Garnett has not for once missed the boat. She has already commissioned a second 10-part run of Attachments. \"I rather like the fact that it all started to go wrong. It's more dramatic,\" she says. \"If people were still effortlessly becoming internet millionaires, there would be less dramatic potential. There is now more awareness of the pressures and the possibility of failure - that's more potent.\" Recognise anybody from your new media office? Mike (Justin Pierre): seethru.co.uk founder.

Under the \"new interventionism\", it is industry that pays huge sums to the government rather than vice-versa. Following the \u00a322.5bn raised from selling radio spectrum for the third generation of internet-linked mobile phones, the government is now poised to raise even more cash. </p> <p>It is considering speeding up the introduction of digital television - involving the demise of conventional analogue sets - to 2004 instead of towards the end of the decade, a move that would free high-quality spectrum for auction, thereby raising tens of billions of pounds extra for the Treasury's coffers. Part of this windfall gain would be used to finance the switchover from analogue to digital TV for poorer people, who might not otherwise be able to afford it. </p> <p>This could turn out to be a brilliant policy - as long as it is done for industrial and consumer reasons and not financial ones. The case for pulling the plug on analogue is simple. All future television sets will be digital anyway, because that is the way the world is going, and they offer considerable advances in performance, picture quality and interactivity with phones and the internet. Britain already has a competitive edge because of early adoption by a minority of viewers. If Britain becomes the first mass market for digital TV, then not only will consumers benefit, but our companies will have an advantage selling products, infrastructure and software to the rest of the world. </p> <p>But several vital conditions must be met. First, poorer people should have subsidised or free access to the decoders that will convert their analogue signals into digital ones. This could be paid for out of the small change from auctioning the spectrum. Second, bidders must only be offered a lease on the spectrum - say of 15 to 20 years - and not a freehold for ever. If spectrum were reauctioned every 15 or 20 years, it would span the planning horizons of most companies, while providing a self-refreshing source of revenue for governments at a time when people are becoming resistant to paying more taxes. Third, it must not be done for political reasons: accelerating the switch-off simply to prevent a cash bonanza falling into the hands of a future Conservative government. An early switch to digital is a policy that has huge economic benefits in its own right. It does not need any other cynical explanation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour has discovered an industrial policy that alchemists could only dream about. Under the \"new interventionism\", it is industry that pays huge sums to the government rather than vice-versa. Following the \u00a322.5bn raised from selling radio spectrum for the third generation of internet-linked mobile phones, the government is now poised to raise even more cash. It is considering speeding up the introduction of digital television - involving the demise of conventional analogue sets - to 2004 instead of towards the end of the decade, a move that would free high-quality spectrum for auction, thereby raising tens of billions of pounds extra for the Treasury's coffers. Part of this windfall gain would be used to finance the switchover from analogue to digital TV for poorer people, who might not otherwise be able to afford it. This could turn out to be a brilliant policy - as long as it is done for industrial and consumer reasons and not financial ones. The case for pulling the plug on analogue is simple. All future television sets will be digital anyway, because that is the way the world is going, and they offer considerable advances in performance, picture quality and interactivity with phones and the internet. Britain already has a competitive edge because of early adoption by a minority of viewers. If Britain becomes the first mass market for digital TV, then not only will consumers benefit, but our companies will have an advantage selling products, infrastructure and software to the rest of the world. But several vital conditions must be met. First, poorer people should have subsidised or free access to the decoders that will convert their analogue signals into digital ones. This could be paid for out of the small change from auctioning the spectrum. Second, bidders must only be offered a lease on the spectrum - say of 15 to 20 years - and not a freehold for ever. If spectrum were reauctioned every 15 or 20 years, it would span the planning horizons of most companies, while providing a self-refreshing source of revenue for governments at a time when people are becoming resistant to paying more taxes. Third, it must not be done for political reasons: accelerating the switch-off simply to prevent a cash bonanza falling into the hands of a future Conservative government. An early switch to digital is a policy that has huge economic benefits in its own right. It does not need any other cynical explanation.",

I also want to know, if it is switched to 10, what the BBC can put on between 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock to justify the move.\" He conceded the change was probably inevitable. \"A bulletin at 10pm may turn out to be just as good as at 9pm and just as effective. I just hope so.\" The veteran BBC correspondent Charles Wheeler told the festival that he was concerned about the \"dumbing down\" of news. \"I think television has reached the point where it is going down some curious corridors,\" he said. At the weekend, Mr Dyke denied that his decision to move the news to 10pm would result in fewer viewers for the bulletin and claimed it would allow the BBC to bolster its peaktime schedule on its principal channel. The BBC is to spend an extra \u00a3480m on all its channels in the next three years.",

One of the most talked-about side stories of last week's convention was an LA Times report that a member of Rage Against the Machine, the protest rock group, once worked for a politician. Vote.com was the only site which seemed to break out of this rut with a column by Dick Morris on Bill and Hillary that was widely reported, not least for the writer's own feelings towards the First Lady. </p> <p>There have been some real bonuses from the increased online coverage. Search and access facilities improved and many sites attempted real audience participation. Unfortunately, these services were also subject to glitches. C-SPAN.org's search tool, designed to find specific words in key speeches, crashed during the Republican convention, for example. Online political coverage appears to be at the third innings of a nine-innings baseball game, as they say here. The question is: will the game be over in November? </p> <p>The signs so far suggest not. During this time of peace and prosperity, the only party people are really interested in are those being held by Barbra Streisand or attended by Billy Joel. The excess of supply provided by the raft of new sites is unlikely to be met by demand until people are worried about their own jobs or security.

Vote.com was the only site which seemed to break out of this rut with a column by Dick Morris on Bill and Hillary that was widely reported, not least for the writer's own feelings towards the First Lady. There have been some real bonuses from the increased online coverage. Search and access facilities improved and many sites attempted real audience participation. Unfortunately, these services were also subject to glitches. C-SPAN.org's search tool, designed to find specific words in key speeches, crashed during the Republican convention, for example. Online political coverage appears to be at the third innings of a nine-innings baseball game, as they say here. The question is: will the game be over in November? The signs so far suggest not. During this time of peace and prosperity, the only party people are really interested in are those being held by Barbra Streisand or attended by Billy Joel. The excess of supply provided by the raft of new sites is unlikely to be met by demand until people are worried about their own jobs or security. Rather than those of strangers on a desert island. jane.martinson@theguardian.com",

Apart, possibly, from Gerry Anderson: you could imagine Captain Scarlet swinging around in one of these on his day off. The Insight is deeply retro, as visions of the future tend to be.

The Insight is powered partly by petrol and partly by electricity. It has a petrol engine in the front and an electric motor in the back, working together in petrol-saving harmony. In the future, when we're scraping the barrel for oil, everyone is going to wish they had bought an Insight, or something like it. </p> <p>Hybrid cars are not in themselves new. General Motors made one - the Impact - 10 years ago; more recently, Toyota toyed with something called a Prius. But Honda are the first to make a hybrid car you can drive off a dealer's forecourt. And you can do so safe in the knowledge that, simply by buying an Insight, you are making Japan a poorer place; the company claims it is losing around \u00a34,000 on each model sold.

However you look at it, that's an awful lot of new things. But then the creation of a viable, mass-market electric car poses an awful lot of problems. Obviously the technology has been in place for years to power a car with a battery. The problem was the battery needed to be the size of your sitting room. Then there was the question of the battery running out while you were on a motorway, say, or a hill, or simply a long way from the nearest branch of John Menzies. On top of all that, a general feeling lingered about the electric car that no matter how cunningly you grappled with the logistics, it was always going to look and drive like a drugged-up milk float. </p> <p>Into this design minefield Honda unflinchingly marched, brandishing devious calculations relating to space and weight. The Insight's slimline batteries fit neatly in the boot and you don't have to tow them around in a separate trailer. Nor do you ever need to take the car home and plug it in overnight. When you accelerate, the electric motor lends a helping hand. While you slow down, the motor is busy recharging its batteries. </p> <p>And surprisingly for a vehicle which shares a power source with the Unigate fleet, the Insight is extremely comfortable to sit in - firm and roomy. It's a two-seater but it's a shade more practical than the average sports car. Behind the seats lies what is, in effect, the largest parcel shelf in history. It extends right to the tail of the car and offers a plausible space for a few suitcases, a bag of golf clubs or even a medium-sized dog. These things will entirely block your already awkwardly diminished view from the rear-view mirror. But the chances are you won't be doing much looking at the road, anyway. You'll be concentrating on the petrol consumption figures, handily updating all the time in a display on the toy-like dashboard. </p> <p>There is probably no lighter vehicle on the road that isn't a bicycle. Most of the Insight's body is made out of aluminium and the bits that aren't are made out of nylon composite. Thus the car weighs little more than the airbag on a Grand Jeep Cherokee. This means it whips along, even with its unglamorous 1-litre engine, though there is an unnerving downside. The feel of the doors as you open them put me in mind of something that I couldn't quite place at first, though I got there eventually: Coke cans. Of course, they're stronger than that, but even so, at the wheel of the Insight, I couldn't help feeling more than averagely queasy about the prospect of a collision. </p> <p>Honda insist, though, that \"weight reduction has not been achieved at the cost of collision safety\".

The carnival, which began in 1964 as a celebration of West Indian music and culture, now attracts people from all ethnic backgrounds. Police and carnival organisers have worked closely together to ensure this year's event will be as trouble-free as possible. A police spokeswoman said there were 36 crimes reported in the vicinity of the carnival route yesterday and 25 arrests for offences including drunkenness, public disorder, and two serious assaults - one on an officer. As always, police advise people not to wear expensive jewellery or carry expensive belongings and large sums of money. Although there has been some trouble in previous years, police expect their main problem to be lost children. As well as hundreds of spectacular floats in the procession, the route is lined by a vast array of stalls selling foods from around the world and, in particular, the Caribbean. The Kensal Road area was a hive of activity with people making last-minute preparations, putting the finishing touches to floats to the sound of scores of bands warming up on the back of trailer lorries. Yesterday, young and old turned out in their thousands for annual the children's parade. Steel bands, reggae floats and ever-more flamboyant costumes were just some of the attractions that drew the crowds for the opening day of the bank holiday extravaganza. Members of the West Indies cricket team, in town for the final Test match this week, joined the party with fast-bowler Curtly Ambrose cooking up some sizzling chicken on the barbecue. Even the threat of rain failed to deter the 400,000 revellers, who received their reward when the clouds gave way to blue skies for much of Sunday afternoon. A man was taken to hospital after being stabbed but his injuries were not thought to be serious. Scotland Yard said one officer sustained minor burns after being attacked with hot dog fat. London Ambulance Service dealt with 114 casualties on Sunday, and 17 of those were taken to hospital. They included a mounted policeman who fell off his horse and two men who suffered suspected heart attacks.",

It offers only cold showers for the snorkellers and scuba divers enjoying a day on the pontoon, to discourage what Quicksilver's chief biologist, Douglas Baird, calls \"Hollywood showers\"; lengthy soap-sudded affairs which produce detergent-filled waste water by the bucketload.</p> <p>But the dumping continues, because they use saltwater for much of their supply, and the local area lacks a sewage treatment plant sophisticated enough to deal with it.</p> <p>The council proposes to build one soon, but Quicksilver, with its 300 tourists a day, would probably require a whole plant itself. As planes packed with tourists continue to circle down from above the mountains into fast-growing Cairns, a strategy has been developed for the growth and management of tourism.</p> <p>Both reef and rainforest bodies pride themselves on it. \"We are probably the best-managed marine park in the world,\" claims Morris.</p> <p>The reef is zoned so that some sections are set aside for fishing and others for tourists. Some 80% of tourists are routed into just 5% of the reef and operators are required to pay environmental charges and meet stringent conditions before being granted permits to take visitors onto the reef.</p> <p>But, Morris admits: \"There has been a lot of talk about serious environmental management but not a lot done on the ground.\"</p> <p>The chief executive of wet tropics, Russell Watkinson, also concedes that they haven't married self-regulation with real legislation yet. For instance, they say that the state law introduced in February banning the clearing of rainforest has been, at best, \"flexible\".</p> <p>While McKenzie stresses there isn't a direct relation between the number of visitors and the impact caused, wet tropics knows the tourist business is a numbers game.</p> <p>\"Ultimately there will be a limit,\" admits Watkinson. Wet tropics has set a ceiling at 750,000 visitors a year, almost double the current number, but whether the tourist industry and the government will enforce it is another matter.</p> <p>The fragile ecology of the reef and rainforest may not be able to withstand the relentless influx of tourists. Many like the place so much that they want to buy a plot of land and build a house there.</p> <p>The main road that snakes up the coastline between rainforest and reef offers a typical environmental catch-22. Further north it becomes a dirt track, discouraging day-trippers. But the dust blown up by persistent vehicles settles on roadside vegetation during the dry season, and kills it off. Yet sealing the track with tarmac to stop the dust would simply increase the number of tourists heading further into the \"wilderness\".</p> <p>Morris says that Australia is perceived as a green country: \"But this is only because we are a young country and haven't had the time to bugger it up yet.\" Everyone involved with the reef and rainforest knows there is no shortage of people or opportunities to do so.</p> <p><b>Useful link:</b><br><a href=\"http://www.quicksilver-cruises.com\" target=\"_new\">Quicksilver Cruises</a></p>",

It offers only cold showers for the snorkellers and scuba divers enjoying a day on the pontoon, to discourage what Quicksilver's chief biologist, Douglas Baird, calls \"Hollywood showers\"; lengthy soap-sudded affairs which produce detergent-filled waste water by the bucketload. But the dumping continues, because they use saltwater for much of their supply, and the local area lacks a sewage treatment plant sophisticated enough to deal with it. The council proposes to build one soon, but Quicksilver, with its 300 tourists a day, would probably require a whole plant itself. As planes packed with tourists continue to circle down from above the mountains into fast-growing Cairns, a strategy has been developed for the growth and management of tourism. Both reef and rainforest bodies pride themselves on it. \"We are probably the best-managed marine park in the world,\" claims Morris. The reef is zoned so that some sections are set aside for fishing and others for tourists. Some 80% of tourists are routed into just 5% of the reef and operators are required to pay environmental charges and meet stringent conditions before being granted permits to take visitors onto the reef. But, Morris admits: \"There has been a lot of talk about serious environmental management but not a lot done on the ground.\" The chief executive of wet tropics, Russell Watkinson, also concedes that they haven't married self-regulation with real legislation yet. For instance, they say that the state law introduced in February banning the clearing of rainforest has been, at best, \"flexible\". While McKenzie stresses there isn't a direct relation between the number of visitors and the impact caused, wet tropics knows the tourist business is a numbers game. \"Ultimately there will be a limit,\" admits Watkinson. Wet tropics has set a ceiling at 750,000 visitors a year, almost double the current number, but whether the tourist industry and the government will enforce it is another matter. The fragile ecology of the reef and rainforest may not be able to withstand the relentless influx of tourists. Many like the place so much that they want to buy a plot of land and build a house there. The main road that snakes up the coastline between rainforest and reef offers a typical environmental catch-22. Further north it becomes a dirt track, discouraging day-trippers. But the dust blown up by persistent vehicles settles on roadside vegetation during the dry season, and kills it off. Yet sealing the track with tarmac to stop the dust would simply increase the number of tourists heading further into the \"wilderness\". Morris says that Australia is perceived as a green country: \"But this is only because we are a young country and haven't had the time to bugger it up yet.\" Everyone involved with the reef and rainforest knows there is no shortage of people or opportunities to do so.

      "byline": "Stephen Moss",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A look in the car park at West Ham's training ground in Ilford tells you a good deal about Stuart Pearce. While the Hammers' flamboyant star striker, Paolo Di Canio, slides into his state-of the-art silver Jaguar, Pearce makes do with a bright red Mondeo. (\"It was only delivered yesterday,\" he says proudly.) Di Canio might win all the headlines, but Pearce is assured of the undying affection of Mondeo Men everywhere. </p> <p>Pearce, affectionately known as Psycho, is the People's Player, and it seems appropriate that he should be finishing his playing career - he is now 38, antediluvian by football standards - at West Ham. Even in this shiny, superficial corporate age, the Hammers remain loyal to their roots as a family club, a club that represents a tough pocket of East London. At the training ground a couple of hundred fans have gathered to ogle their idols and collect autographs. Pearce only joined last year, but he is already a folk hero here. </p> <p>Last season, Pearce broke his leg twice, enough you would think to finish the career of most players, let alone one who has played in the Premiership for the best part of two decades. But this season he is back in the first team, on a monthly contract, naturally taking each game as it comes, because at his age that's the way it has to be. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, when the then Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit decided that Pearce was finished as a player and humiliated him by playing youngsters in place of the seasoned international, he was ready to quit. But West Ham manager Harry Redknapp offered him a contract and Pearce, eager to prove Gullit wrong, jumped at it. </p> <p>\"I was a week away from retiring,\" he says. \"If Harry hadn't come in to get me, and if he hadn't been so supportive when I broke my leg twice last season, I wouldn't still be playing. When I broke my leg for the second time, he said 'we'll stick by you, get yourself right, and there'll be a new contract here for you'. There aren't many managers who would do that.\" </p> <p>Pearce, still a dependable left-back in a country strangely short of left-sided players, would probably have gone to this summer's European Championships if he had been fit. And even now he may add to his 78 England caps: some have suggested that Kevin Keegan will pick him to play against Germany in the World Cup qualifier at Wembley in October, in the final match at the stadium before it is bulldozed. It would be a glorious last hurrah for the old campaigner, and wonderfully resonant too. It was Pearce who missed the penalty that undermined England in the World Cup semi-final shoot-out against Germany in Italy in 1990. History demands redress. </p> <p>This week, Pearce will train with the England squad in the run-up to the friendly against France, passing on his experience but also staying in the frame in case the call comes. If it does, he will be there \"like a shot\". Pearce wears his patriotism on his sleeve, and on his face too: the emotions he has displayed in his games for his country - from the agony of 1990 to the ecstasy of Euro 96, when he was successful with a penalty against Spain in the quarter-finals - have endeared him to the public. \"A lot of people who watch football probably see a bit of themselves in me,\" he says. \"I give everything I've got, am reasonably aggressive, and they know they're going to get 100% out of me.\" </p> <p>Pearce has another task this week - launching his autobiography, a typically honest account of a career that has seen him play at the highest level for almost 20 years without winning anything beyond two League Cup medals with Nottingham Forest. In the book, he admits that his wife, Liz, calls him the \"nearly man\"; he both accepts the tag and uses it as a spur to drive himself on. </p> <p>\"I think I am the nearly man. I'm probably four semi-finals away from having a World Cup winners' medal, a European Championship medal, and maybe two FA Cup winners' medals. I've got two League Cup winners' medals to show for 17 years of professional football. But the fact that I haven't achieved as much as a lot of players gives me more motivation to carry on. There is always something there that I'm striving for. There are a lot of journeymen who have picked up as many medals as I have. But I am one of the 10 most-capped players that England have had: that's the thing I've got in my armoury. </p> <p>\"It annoys me that the big medals were always out of my grasp, but that spurred me on. When we came back from the World Cup in 1990, there was a feeling that we'd achieved a lot, but I thought 'hang on a minute, we've come back, we've won nothing'. Plus I'd missed the crucial penalty. That made me work harder. After that, I had the best season I'd ever had for Forest: adversity spurs me on more than people patting me on the back all the time.\" </p> <p>Pearce is supremely motivated, and that's why fans love him. He is talented, but it is what he makes of his talent that people admire. \"Every day you've got something to prove and once you've got that attitude you're halfway there,\" he says. \"When I signed for Newcastle in 1997, I signed with John Barnes and Ian Rush. We all got put into the same category of old players at the end of our careers, but, with no disrespect to them, I felt that my attiitude was different to theirs. They'd come from Liverpool with a sackful of medals; I'd come from Forest with nothing. They're not playing now and I am; people put us in the same category but I didn't because I was still hungry for the game. </p> <p>\"I always have something to motivate me. When I came here last year, it was to prove Ruud Gullit wrong and show that I was still good enough to play in the Premiership. Now it's proving to people that I can come back from two broken legs. I want to prove to the manager that he was right to bring me here. I'm on a monthly contract, but if he offered me a one-year contract and I broke my leg again, I'd rip the contract up. I wouldn't want to take money for nothing; I want to earn it. I've always wanted to give value for money and I believe I've done that at all the clubs I've been at.\" </p> <p>Pearce's work ethic and unflagging motivation are rooted in his background. His father was a waiter who worked 18-hour days to provide for his four children and buy a house in Shepherd's Bush. Once he had paid the mortgage, he sold the house, bought a house outright in Wembley and got a job as a postman, allowing him to see his family occasionally. That discipline and level-headedness rubbed off on Pearce junior, who trained as an electrician while playing non-league football for Wealdstone in his late teens, and made sure his job was kept open for him when he was snapped up by Bobby Gould at Coventry at the late-starting age of 21. </p> <p>\"It wasn't until after a couple of years at Forest that I realised I probably was good enough,\" he says. \"I didn't know whether it was going to work for me or not, but I did have a qualification as an electrician. The fact that I was a late starter and missed my first five years may have been a spur to play on longer.\" </p> <p>Does he regret not having joined one of the super-clubs that now divide up the spoils between them? \"No. Every time I've made a decision about my career, apart from what side to hit the penalty, I think it's been the right decision. I don't look back with regrets. I was always happy at Forest, the fans were magnificent to me, those were the halcyon days of my career, and I think I did the right thing staying put. If I'd gone to a bigger club, I know I'd have a lot more medals now, but I also know it was the right decision to stay.\" </p> <p> He was managed at Forest by the legendary Brian Clough. He talks about him in the way people talk about the Krays - firm but fair, loved him and loathed him, great motivator but ruled by fear. \"I was scared of him when I went there, but I respected him. There were good times and bad times. I can remember turning up for training and hating his guts, then by the end of training loving the man.\" </p> <p>Pearce rates Clough as one of the three best managers he's played under, the others being Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, both of whom, he believes, had more to offer to England. \"England got rid of Hoddle too quickly,\" he says. \"He should be given another chance somewhere down the road, but he probably won't be. We shoot ourselves in the foot too often.\" </p> <p>Pearce himself had a spell of management in the darkest days at Forest, when Clough's successor Frank Clark had been sacked and Pearce was left to pick up the pieces at a club hurtling out of the Premiership. The club was in dire straits financially and when a new board finally took over, there was no place for Pearce, who ended his 12-year love affair with Forest and headed off for his unhappy spell at Newcastle. </p> <p>In many ways, Pearce is a throwback to a more innocent footballing age, when fans felt in touch with players and had a sense of ownership of clubs. \"There've been a lot of changes in football while I've been playing. The plc side of things is quite alien to me. We used to have a big Christmas party at Forest, but that never happened at Newcastle. We had to pay to hire the ground for a players' Christmas party. You could turn up to see the chairman and they didn't know who you were at reception.\" </p> <p>But, regardless of those changes and the bleak end to his time at Forest, Pearce is determined to carve out a new career as a manager when his playing days finally end. He is collecting coaching qualifications - something many top players hoping to make the transition to management have failed to do in the past - and by next summer will be ready to start applying for jobs. It is one of the compensations of the uncertain world of football that the gnarled old player can overnight turn into the fresh-faced young manager. </p> <p>Inevitably, Pearce's autobiography is called Psycho, and he stares out from the cover with a gaze of steely intensity.

      "bodyText": "A look in the car park at West Ham's training ground in Ilford tells you a good deal about Stuart Pearce. While the Hammers' flamboyant star striker, Paolo Di Canio, slides into his state-of the-art silver Jaguar, Pearce makes do with a bright red Mondeo. (\"It was only delivered yesterday,\" he says proudly.) Di Canio might win all the headlines, but Pearce is assured of the undying affection of Mondeo Men everywhere. Pearce, affectionately known as Psycho, is the People's Player, and it seems appropriate that he should be finishing his playing career - he is now 38, antediluvian by football standards - at West Ham. Even in this shiny, superficial corporate age, the Hammers remain loyal to their roots as a family club, a club that represents a tough pocket of East London. At the training ground a couple of hundred fans have gathered to ogle their idols and collect autographs. Pearce only joined last year, but he is already a folk hero here. Last season, Pearce broke his leg twice, enough you would think to finish the career of most players, let alone one who has played in the Premiership for the best part of two decades. But this season he is back in the first team, on a monthly contract, naturally taking each game as it comes, because at his age that's the way it has to be. A couple of years ago, when the then Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit decided that Pearce was finished as a player and humiliated him by playing youngsters in place of the seasoned international, he was ready to quit. But West Ham manager Harry Redknapp offered him a contract and Pearce, eager to prove Gullit wrong, jumped at it. \"I was a week away from retiring,\" he says. \"If Harry hadn't come in to get me, and if he hadn't been so supportive when I broke my leg twice last season, I wouldn't still be playing. When I broke my leg for the second time, he said 'we'll stick by you, get yourself right, and there'll be a new contract here for you'. There aren't many managers who would do that.\" Pearce, still a dependable left-back in a country strangely short of left-sided players, would probably have gone to this summer's European Championships if he had been fit. And even now he may add to his 78 England caps: some have suggested that Kevin Keegan will pick him to play against Germany in the World Cup qualifier at Wembley in October, in the final match at the stadium before it is bulldozed. It would be a glorious last hurrah for the old campaigner, and wonderfully resonant too. It was Pearce who missed the penalty that undermined England in the World Cup semi-final shoot-out against Germany in Italy in 1990. History demands redress. This week, Pearce will train with the England squad in the run-up to the friendly against France, passing on his experience but also staying in the frame in case the call comes. If it does, he will be there \"like a shot\". Pearce wears his patriotism on his sleeve, and on his face too: the emotions he has displayed in his games for his country - from the agony of 1990 to the ecstasy of Euro 96, when he was successful with a penalty against Spain in the quarter-finals - have endeared him to the public. \"A lot of people who watch football probably see a bit of themselves in me,\" he says. \"I give everything I've got, am reasonably aggressive, and they know they're going to get 100% out of me.\" Pearce has another task this week - launching his autobiography, a typically honest account of a career that has seen him play at the highest level for almost 20 years without winning anything beyond two League Cup medals with Nottingham Forest. In the book, he admits that his wife, Liz, calls him the \"nearly man\"; he both accepts the tag and uses it as a spur to drive himself on. \"I think I am the nearly man. I'm probably four semi-finals away from having a World Cup winners' medal, a European Championship medal, and maybe two FA Cup winners' medals. I've got two League Cup winners' medals to show for 17 years of professional football. But the fact that I haven't achieved as much as a lot of players gives me more motivation to carry on. There is always something there that I'm striving for. There are a lot of journeymen who have picked up as many medals as I have. But I am one of the 10 most-capped players that England have had: that's the thing I've got in my armoury. \"It annoys me that the big medals were always out of my grasp, but that spurred me on. When we came back from the World Cup in 1990, there was a feeling that we'd achieved a lot, but I thought 'hang on a minute, we've come back, we've won nothing'. Plus I'd missed the crucial penalty. That made me work harder. After that, I had the best season I'd ever had for Forest: adversity spurs me on more than people patting me on the back all the time.\" Pearce is supremely motivated, and that's why fans love him. He is talented, but it is what he makes of his talent that people admire. \"Every day you've got something to prove and once you've got that attitude you're halfway there,\" he says. \"When I signed for Newcastle in 1997, I signed with John Barnes and Ian Rush. We all got put into the same category of old players at the end of our careers, but, with no disrespect to them, I felt that my attiitude was different to theirs. They'd come from Liverpool with a sackful of medals; I'd come from Forest with nothing. They're not playing now and I am; people put us in the same category but I didn't because I was still hungry for the game. \"I always have something to motivate me. When I came here last year, it was to prove Ruud Gullit wrong and show that I was still good enough to play in the Premiership. Now it's proving to people that I can come back from two broken legs. I want to prove to the manager that he was right to bring me here. I'm on a monthly contract, but if he offered me a one-year contract and I broke my leg again, I'd rip the contract up. I wouldn't want to take money for nothing; I want to earn it. I've always wanted to give value for money and I believe I've done that at all the clubs I've been at.\" Pearce's work ethic and unflagging motivation are rooted in his background. His father was a waiter who worked 18-hour days to provide for his four children and buy a house in Shepherd's Bush. Once he had paid the mortgage, he sold the house, bought a house outright in Wembley and got a job as a postman, allowing him to see his family occasionally. That discipline and level-headedness rubbed off on Pearce junior, who trained as an electrician while playing non-league football for Wealdstone in his late teens, and made sure his job was kept open for him when he was snapped up by Bobby Gould at Coventry at the late-starting age of 21. \"It wasn't until after a couple of years at Forest that I realised I probably was good enough,\" he says. \"I didn't know whether it was going to work for me or not, but I did have a qualification as an electrician. The fact that I was a late starter and missed my first five years may have been a spur to play on longer.\" Does he regret not having joined one of the super-clubs that now divide up the spoils between them? \"No. Every time I've made a decision about my career, apart from what side to hit the penalty, I think it's been the right decision. I don't look back with regrets. I was always happy at Forest, the fans were magnificent to me, those were the halcyon days of my career, and I think I did the right thing staying put. If I'd gone to a bigger club, I know I'd have a lot more medals now, but I also know it was the right decision to stay.\" He was managed at Forest by the legendary Brian Clough. He talks about him in the way people talk about the Krays - firm but fair, loved him and loathed him, great motivator but ruled by fear. \"I was scared of him when I went there, but I respected him. There were good times and bad times. I can remember turning up for training and hating his guts, then by the end of training loving the man.\" Pearce rates Clough as one of the three best managers he's played under, the others being Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, both of whom, he believes, had more to offer to England. \"England got rid of Hoddle too quickly,\" he says. \"He should be given another chance somewhere down the road, but he probably won't be. We shoot ourselves in the foot too often.\" Pearce himself had a spell of management in the darkest days at Forest, when Clough's successor Frank Clark had been sacked and Pearce was left to pick up the pieces at a club hurtling out of the Premiership. The club was in dire straits financially and when a new board finally took over, there was no place for Pearce, who ended his 12-year love affair with Forest and headed off for his unhappy spell at Newcastle. In many ways, Pearce is a throwback to a more innocent footballing age, when fans felt in touch with players and had a sense of ownership of clubs. \"There've been a lot of changes in football while I've been playing. The plc side of things is quite alien to me. We used to have a big Christmas party at Forest, but that never happened at Newcastle. We had to pay to hire the ground for a players' Christmas party. You could turn up to see the chairman and they didn't know who you were at reception.\" But, regardless of those changes and the bleak end to his time at Forest, Pearce is determined to carve out a new career as a manager when his playing days finally end. He is collecting coaching qualifications - something many top players hoping to make the transition to management have failed to do in the past - and by next summer will be ready to start applying for jobs. It is one of the compensations of the uncertain world of football that the gnarled old player can overnight turn into the fresh-faced young manager. Inevitably, Pearce's autobiography is called Psycho, and he stares out from the cover with a gaze of steely intensity. But don't let that fool you. While he plays it hard on the pitch, off it he is polite and easygoing: a private man for whom family life - a farmhouse in Wiltshire, a wife who keeps horses, a two-year-old daughter called Chelsea (why not Forest?) - is very important. He says he still likes a drink and can let his hair down with friends, but he is definitely a lover of old-style football clubs rather than new-style nightclubs. \"The Psycho nickname was just a bit of fun,\" he says. \"In the 80s everyone was called Psycho or Rambo. It doesn't represent what I'm like away from football. You've got to be a bit more cute than that. If you're an idiot and try to live up to your nickname, you won't last very long.

But in 78 games for England I've been booked five times and never been sent off. I've only been sent off three times playing for my club, which in this day and age is quite an achievement.\" So not Psycho. And not the Nearly Man either. \u0095 Psycho: Stuart Pearce's Autobiography is published by Headline , price \u00a317.99",

In a package of changes to the traditional school calendar, a commission set up by the Local Government Association will also call for GCSE and A-level exams to be brought forward to as early as April to allow students to apply to university and other courses after they have their results. In a report to be published on Friday and presented to government, the commission, headed by the former Labour MP, Chris Price, will recommend that the three-term school year be reorganised into six terms of a more even length. The LGA, which represents local education authorities, wants a debate on the implications of a shake-up to the school year, which until now has been strongly resisted by teacher unions. Private polling by the commission is understood to have shown that parents are overwhelmingly in favour of changes because of childcare considerations and the cost of taking holidays at peak times. Graham Lane, LGA education spokesman, commented: \"Teachers are creatures of habit. It is time we moved with the times. \"There must be scope for some more flexibility.\"",
