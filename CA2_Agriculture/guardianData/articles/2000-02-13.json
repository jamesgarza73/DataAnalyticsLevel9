I'm afraid these days that a lot of the bigger name players, who are on so much money, are not prepared to serve an apprenticeship.' </p> <p>Taylor was speaking on the official website of the League Managers' Association, who have begun to recognise the problem of inexperienced, under- qualified managers. 'We believe it's almost impossible to succeed in a first appointment. They haven't got a clue,' says spokesman Olaf Dixon.

Along with the Uefa licences, it is a start. </p> <p>Of course, knowledge and character rather than paper qualifications will always be part of any successful manager's armoury - perhaps his key assets.

      "trailText": "<p>Former managers of Celtic <strong>Liam Brady and Lou Macari </strong> believe trying to make up ground lost by poor club policy in the years gone by makes it difficult for any manager and John Barnes should have been given more time</p>",
      "byline": "Liam Brady",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Liam Brady</strong></p> <p>Celtic, from my experience, never moved with the times. As soon as Rangers decided they were going into the Big League Celtic were caught cold. They were lagging when the Taylor Report came out and are still playing catch-up. Trying to make up ground lost by poor club policy in the years gone by makes it difficult for any manager. </p> <p>When I was there it was a complicated time off the field but in the past few years the club's infrastructure has been turned round. They have good people in charge and sound financial stability as well as a tremendous stadium and support. The root of their problems at the moment is simply down to the quality of their players. </p> <p>Unless they correct that, the manager is always going to have problems. Celtic are not shopping in the same class of supermarket as Rangers, who have top-quality international players from top-quality countries - Germans, Dutch, Italians. Celtic are not buying from that end of the market. It was the same for me when I was there, looking for bargains who could do a good job for us. The statistics tell you those players are very difficult to find. </p> <p>The youth ploicy has to improve in tandem so that in the long-term they don't have to go to the transfer market all the time. Their identity is not a team full of foreign players, and although Scottish players are not in the same abundance as they used to be, they are out there. </p> <p>Those are the targets they need to aim for. But in my experience, and I think John Barnes felt the same pressure, Celtic supporters want it yesterday and not tomorrow. </p> <p>It's a unique club with unique circumstances; a wealth of managerial experience doesn't give you any insight into what that job is all about. You are not only running a football team, you are almost the leader of a community in Scotland. And if the rival community fares much better they make the other suffer tremendously. It's hard for Celtic supporters to stomach what they are going through and the man they look to blame is the manager. </p> <p>We didn't win the league in my first two years, and going into my third it didn't look likely the team were going to challenge Rangers. John has had even more pressure: as well as Rangers being so many points clear they've had the tremendous jolt of this Inverness Caledonian Thistle defeat. I hoped there wouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction - only a month ago John won manager of the month. I empathise with him very much. </p> <p><em>Liam Brady was manager of Celtic from July 1991 to October 1993.</em> </p> <p><strong>Lou Macari</strong><br></p> <p>All managers experience embarrassing results - my own worst one as Celtic manager was a home defeat by Motherwell. They were also in the Premier League, but at the time it was looked upon as a disaster. </p> <p>I also remember playing for Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final, with Kenny Dalglish, and us losing to Partick Thistle. By any standards, though, losing at home to Inverness Caley has to be the worst Celtic result ever. We should not hide from that fact. </p> <p>Even so, my own view about John Barnes is that he should have been given a fair amount of time. Unfortunately for me, I was only Celtic manager for about six months before Fergus McCann came in, got rid of the board who appointed me and obviously wanted rid of me as well. That I could understand. In Barnes's case, the people who are running the club now were the people who appointed him - and with less than a season in the post he should have been given the benefit of the doubt and a chance to see if he could improve Celtic's results. </p> <p>The expectations at a club like Celtic are remarkable, although to be quite honest, I did not feel I was under a great deal of pressure there. The problem I had was that there were one or two players - who shall remain nameless - who were not 100 per cent committed to Celtic Football Club. That caused disruption. </p> <p>I was reminded of that by the reports of what happened in the Celtic dressing-room at half-time on Tuesday (the clashes involving John Barnes and Eric Black with Jonathan Gould and Mark Viduka). It is difficult to avoid the impression that there is trouble in the camp. </p> <p>No disrespect to Inverness Caley, but even on a bad night, and no matter what team Celtic put out, I cannot see how they can lose to a side like that if the players are giving their all and pulling in the right direction. So the finger should be pointed not so much in the direction of John Barnes, but the players. </p> <p>Jock Stein was manager when I was a Celtic player, and because we relied on him for our livelihoods, he was very much in the driving seat. Some players were wary about even talking to him, let alone answering back. It is different now. Players are earning fortunes and have become a law unto themselves. </p> <p>The additional problem for a club like Celtic is the number of foreign players there. How can you expect them to have any real appreciation of the culture of the club? </p> <p>Talk to them about the importance of going out and playing for the green-and-white hooped jersey and - well, in most cases - it just does not register. </p> <p> <em>Lou Macari was manager of Celtic from November 1993 to June 1994. </em> </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,136154,00.html\">Fan power blows away old order</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,4284,136156,00.html\">No nous, no credentials, no credibility</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,3740,136199,00.html\">Dundee 0 - 3 Celtic</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Liam Brady Celtic, from my experience, never moved with the times. As soon as Rangers decided they were going into the Big League Celtic were caught cold. They were lagging when the Taylor Report came out and are still playing catch-up. Trying to make up ground lost by poor club policy in the years gone by makes it difficult for any manager. When I was there it was a complicated time off the field but in the past few years the club's infrastructure has been turned round. They have good people in charge and sound financial stability as well as a tremendous stadium and support. The root of their problems at the moment is simply down to the quality of their players. Unless they correct that, the manager is always going to have problems. Celtic are not shopping in the same class of supermarket as Rangers, who have top-quality international players from top-quality countries - Germans, Dutch, Italians. Celtic are not buying from that end of the market. It was the same for me when I was there, looking for bargains who could do a good job for us. The statistics tell you those players are very difficult to find. The youth ploicy has to improve in tandem so that in the long-term they don't have to go to the transfer market all the time. Their identity is not a team full of foreign players, and although Scottish players are not in the same abundance as they used to be, they are out there. Those are the targets they need to aim for. But in my experience, and I think John Barnes felt the same pressure, Celtic supporters want it yesterday and not tomorrow. It's a unique club with unique circumstances; a wealth of managerial experience doesn't give you any insight into what that job is all about. You are not only running a football team, you are almost the leader of a community in Scotland. And if the rival community fares much better they make the other suffer tremendously. It's hard for Celtic supporters to stomach what they are going through and the man they look to blame is the manager. We didn't win the league in my first two years, and going into my third it didn't look likely the team were going to challenge Rangers. John has had even more pressure: as well as Rangers being so many points clear they've had the tremendous jolt of this Inverness Caledonian Thistle defeat. I hoped there wouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction - only a month ago John won manager of the month. I empathise with him very much. Liam Brady was manager of Celtic from July 1991 to October 1993. Lou Macari All managers experience embarrassing results - my own worst one as Celtic manager was a home defeat by Motherwell. They were also in the Premier League, but at the time it was looked upon as a disaster. I also remember playing for Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final, with Kenny Dalglish, and us losing to Partick Thistle. By any standards, though, losing at home to Inverness Caley has to be the worst Celtic result ever. We should not hide from that fact. Even so, my own view about John Barnes is that he should have been given a fair amount of time. Unfortunately for me, I was only Celtic manager for about six months before Fergus McCann came in, got rid of the board who appointed me and obviously wanted rid of me as well. That I could understand. In Barnes's case, the people who are running the club now were the people who appointed him - and with less than a season in the post he should have been given the benefit of the doubt and a chance to see if he could improve Celtic's results. The expectations at a club like Celtic are remarkable, although to be quite honest, I did not feel I was under a great deal of pressure there. The problem I had was that there were one or two players - who shall remain nameless - who were not 100 per cent committed to Celtic Football Club. That caused disruption. I was reminded of that by the reports of what happened in the Celtic dressing-room at half-time on Tuesday (the clashes involving John Barnes and Eric Black with Jonathan Gould and Mark Viduka). It is difficult to avoid the impression that there is trouble in the camp. No disrespect to Inverness Caley, but even on a bad night, and no matter what team Celtic put out, I cannot see how they can lose to a side like that if the players are giving their all and pulling in the right direction. So the finger should be pointed not so much in the direction of John Barnes, but the players. Jock Stein was manager when I was a Celtic player, and because we relied on him for our livelihoods, he was very much in the driving seat. Some players were wary about even talking to him, let alone answering back. It is different now. Players are earning fortunes and have become a law unto themselves. The additional problem for a club like Celtic is the number of foreign players there. How can you expect them to have any real appreciation of the culture of the club? Talk to them about the importance of going out and playing for the green-and-white hooped jersey and - well, in most cases - it just does not register. Lou Macari was manager of Celtic from November 1993 to June 1994. Related stories Fan power blows away old order No nous, no credentials, no credibility Dundee 0 - 3 Celtic",

Mark Ealham, playing without conviction, was caught behind and at 72 for seven England were down to their limp tail when Craig White chopped Lance Klusener onto his leg stump. </p> <p>England had made a sensational start to the match, taking five wickets for seven runs in the space of 21 deliveries. Hussain had won the toss for the first time in the tourna ment and chosen to bowl in the juicy conditions. </p> <p>It was the bounce as much as the generous seam movement that betrayed South Africa's top order, forcing them to play from the crease. Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick produced an impressive opening burst without hinting at the carnage to come. </p> <p>In his third over Gough found himself on a hat-trick. First he had Herschelle Gibbs caught at slip by Knight, wafting, and with his next ball he hurried one inside the bat of Kallis, trimming the bails. </p> <p>In the next over Caddick bowled Neil McKenzie. Again the bounce surprised the opener, who played the ball onto his stumps with his bat handle and gloves. South Africa had lost three wickets with the score on 14. </p> <p>Caddick burst through twice in his next over. He had Jonty Rhodes caught by the diving Hick at second slip and then extracted enough lift to find the top of Pollock's bat, White taking a fine catch at point. </p> <p>South Africa were 21 for five in the ninth over and a crowd spoiled by the riches of recent years surprised themselves with their almost reverential quietness. </p> <p>Cronje's lack of form had placed him under considerable pressure in recent weeks.

'We are getting far too close to the relegation zone and we have to face the fact. You do get fed up when you're not winning, and your confidence suffers, which is worse. That's definitely what has happened to us, but it hasn't taken too many bad results to get us into this situation and it won't need too many good ones to get out of it. But we need to make a big push to turn things round.'</p> <p>Ince suggests injuries and poor results at the same time have sapped morale, although just about every side in the Premiership have lost key players without managing to lose 4-1 at home to Derby and have fans questioning the manager's competence.</p> <p>'I can understand the frustration,' Ince said. 'The fans are passionate here and if you don't match that passion you can be sure they'll let you know. But I don't think there was any reason to get on Bryan Robson's back. He's brought the club a long way forward. He wants to get into Europe, as we all do, and I honestly think this club could be at that level very soon. We just need to stabilise results and do ourselves justice.</p> <p>'Maybe we won't make Europe now, maybe we haven't got quite got a strong enough squad, but we can still go forward. Last season we finished ninth. If we can better that this season it will be progress. No one at this club thinks we will be relegated, and no one will be satisfied if all we do is manage to stay up.'</p> <p>To crack the Premiership elite, Ince reckons, you need either a run of luck with injuries or a squad large enough to give genuine options. Middlesbrough are not quite in the Chelsea or Manchester United league for strength in depth, and are not as practised as Spurs or Leicester at playing the percentages, so they tend to occupy the Premiership middle ground with teams like Aston Villa, Everton or West Ham, an uncertain band where six points can make the difference between comfort and calamity.</p> <p>Ince's alarm last week, for instance, stemmed from the realisation that Boro had slipped to just one place and two points above Southampton. Yet the same table showed Boro level with Newcastle, generally perceived to be doing well under Bobby Robson, and only six points short of the runaway successes of Villa and Leicester with a game in hand. Three points against Villa tomorrow could make a turning point.</p> <p>'We just need something to hang on to,' Ince said. 'We played really well for a point at Liverpool and thought we had done the same at Manchester United, but when your luck's out it's out.'</p> <p>If Boro can survive their annual slump the necessary team-strengthening could be funded by chairman Steve Gibson selling a percentage of his shares to a media company, and as long as the club remain in the Premiership Ince can see only a rosy future.</p> <p>'We have a great stadium and wonderful training facilities,' said Ince. Fabrizio Ravanelli was famously dismissive of Boro's facilities, but Ince, who has also been around a bit, believes the new Rockcliffe training ground to be the best in England. 'It doesn't quite match the one we had at Inter Milan, which even included a hotel, but this already beats anything I've seen in this country, and the hotel is in the pipeline.'</p> <p>Next, Ince has his sights fixed firmly on Euro 2000, and the brief sequence of England friendlies commencing with Argentina at Wembley on Wednesday week, for which Kevin Keegan announces his squad on Thursday. At 32, he can no longer take call-ups for granted, but trusts Keegan will stick with his stated policy of valuing experience above birth certificates. The horrendous home defeat by Scotland was hardly a glowing advertisement for England's thirtysomethings, but Ince believes that was a one-off. </p> <p>'It's always tricky going into matches when you know you don't need to score, and it was hard for us to hit the same tempo we managed to find in Scotland,' he said. 'But at one point everyone was talking about what a mammoth task we faced, then when we qualified we were told it was easy really and we shouldn't have made such hard work of it.</p> <p>'International football is not as straightforward as it looks, it is a really big step from club level. That's why it would be wrong to pitch young players wholesale into matches, even friendlies. You need to learn from the players around you, you need to be nurtured and allowed to adjust gradually.'</p> <p>This is not necessarily how other countries do it. The bright young thing on the verge of a first cap this time is Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, who according to his Anfield colleague Dietmar Hamann would be a regular for Germany by now. Ince remembers the clever and competitive Gerrard from his own time at Anfield - 'We used to play the reserves and you could see at once he was going to be a player' - and would not argue against his fast-tracking, as long as he can be brought into a reasonably settled side.</p> <p>'I've no doubt that Steven Gerrard's time will soon come and probably Joe Cole's too, but you can't just pitch in all the kids - you lose all your experience, and then nobody gets a fair chance.'</p> <p>Ince believes the old guard will see England right in Holland and Belgium, but then, two caps short of a half century, he would. He is happy playing in the holding position with occasional licence to get forward, despite Sir Alex Ferguson's criticism that he should be more disciplined and positionally aware.</p> <p>'People like David Batty and me are supposed to be holding players, hard men and all that crap, but we both feel we have a little more to offer than that,' he explained. 'I feel there's more depth to my game than just sitting in front of the back four. In Euro 96, for example, I kept getting complimented on getting into the box and making things happen. You just have to pick your moments, and when you do go forward it's important someone sits in for you at the back. That hasn't always happened, but good players know what to do.'</p> <p>England have good players, and Ince shares Glenn Hoddle's belief that they could have gone on to far greater things in France 98 but for the never-to-be-forgotten night in St Etienne against next week's opponents.</p> <p>'When I think of Argentina I still think \"Nightmare\" [Ince missed a penalty too], but more and more I think what an incredible night. You never know what's going to be your biggest game or your best moment, but I know now I would have hated to miss that experience. The result is history, but that was a real World Cup night.</p> <p>'I felt so good about the way I was playing, then I missed the penalty. Mind you, I don't think even that was as bad as celebrating Sol Campbell's \"goal\" and suddenly realising the match was still going on and Argentina had a four-against-three situation against us. What a heartstopper that was.'</p> <p>England under Keegan, Ince claims, are positively relaxed. 'I think for various reasons we have struggled to show it on the pitch, but the England set-up at the moment is really comfortable and laid-back,' he said.

No, England can steal their own thunder quite effectively without any help from the oppo. </p> <p>Today they proved that they could have lost the Johnannesburg Test even if they had won the toss. And Allan Donald hadn't been playing. And the English fielders had caught everything that moved. This was a masterclass in self-destruction. </p> <p>No-one can feel more let down than Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick, who took 7 for 37 between them and still finished on the losing side. But what was Nasser Hussain playing at when he took Gough off after he had bowled five overs and brought South Africa to their knees? When Hansie Cronje out-gambles you, by bowling Shaun Pollock straight through and keeping three slips in, you know you must be playing it safe. </p> <p>The thinking was equally poor when England batted. South Africa had the flimsiest bowling attack they've fielded all winter, with Pollock the only potential matchwinner. Inevitably, he was allowed to win the match. Hussain and Nick Knight, the only bankers in the batting, both went for optimistic swipes when the required run-rate was only three an over. </p> <p>Sure, you have to take the initiative and try to put the bad ball away, but in the circumstances this was brainless cricket. It puts one in mind of the equivalent match in 1998-99, when England threw away a winning position against Australia in the first Carlton &amp; United final. Hussain, if you remember, triggered a collapse when he gave Shane Warne the charge. He has had an excellent tour as a batsman and a passable one as a captain. But in both those finals, he should carry the can for England's failure.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We woz robbed! But not by Jacques Kallis, even if the catch he claimed at slip was a swindle. No, England can steal their own thunder quite effectively without any help from the oppo. Today they proved that they could have lost the Johnannesburg Test even if they had won the toss. And Allan Donald hadn't been playing. And the English fielders had caught everything that moved. This was a masterclass in self-destruction. No-one can feel more let down than Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick, who took 7 for 37 between them and still finished on the losing side. But what was Nasser Hussain playing at when he took Gough off after he had bowled five overs and brought South Africa to their knees? When Hansie Cronje out-gambles you, by bowling Shaun Pollock straight through and keeping three slips in, you know you must be playing it safe. The thinking was equally poor when England batted. South Africa had the flimsiest bowling attack they've fielded all winter, with Pollock the only potential matchwinner. Inevitably, he was allowed to win the match. Hussain and Nick Knight, the only bankers in the batting, both went for optimistic swipes when the required run-rate was only three an over. Sure, you have to take the initiative and try to put the bad ball away, but in the circumstances this was brainless cricket. It puts one in mind of the equivalent match in 1998-99, when England threw away a winning position against Australia in the first Carlton &amp; United final. Hussain, if you remember, triggered a collapse when he gave Shane Warne the charge. He has had an excellent tour as a batsman and a passable one as a captain. But in both those finals, he should carry the can for England's failure.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Graham 'notorious' - Davis</strong> <br> Paul Davis - former Arsenal hero, now youth team coach - has revealed how George Graham banned players from using agents at Highbury during his years in charge - at the same time as taking huge backhanders from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge. </p> <p>Davis, in a strong attack on Graham ahead of today's game with Liverpool, also criticised his former manager for driving out senior players and alienating young Andy Cole. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, though, is commended for being, by way of contrast, 'nice'. </p> <p>'The influence of reputable agents, on the whole, is good for players now,' says Davis. 'But back then Graham would say: \"No I'm not talking to any agents.\" He would allow a parent to sit in on meetings, but they were never the best people to represent the player. It happened a lot. </p> <p>'Arsenal players at the time took things they didn't like passively. Because I was a senior player and not content and voiced my opinion he eased me out. The other seniors were people like Steve Williams, Charlie Nicholas, Graham Rix and Kenny Sansom. George moved them on very quickly and I was the only one who stayed.' </p> <p>The same approach also led to Graham releasing Andy Cole to Bristol City. 'I tried to encourage Andy to stay but he didn't get on with management. He was quiet and single-minded and that lack of communication didn't help the situation. He had a personality clash with Graham and had it been a different manager, like Wenger, he might have stayed.' </p> <p>Davis also says Wenger was not serious when he conceded the title to Manchester United last weekend. 'Wenger is nice and expresses himself in a quiet, articulate way. He was only kidding - he likes playing mind games. </p> <p>'Arsenal are still capable of winning it, especially if we beat Liverpool [today]. Of course, it's up to United to keep dropping points, but it's far, far from over.' </p> <p> <strong>The icon, his wife and the director</strong> Scandal at 1860 Munich. Before the Bundesliga's midwinter break, the German club were on a high: fourth in the league, playing flowing football and beating deadly rivals Bayern for the first time in more than 20 years. But since the restart things have all fallen apart: two humiliating defeats against minnows Wolfsburg (1-2) and Ulm (0-3) have ruined the club's most promising season for years. Sex, inevitably, is to blame. </p> <p>According to the German tabloid Bild , the team fell apart after the wife of icon Thomas Hassler was caught in bed with the club's sporting director. Now the affair, which began between Angela (31) and director Edgar Geenen (46) in January, has hit every aspect of the club's operations. Distraught Hassler has begun playing dreadfully, and the players and fans are threatening revolt unless Geenen is sacked. Geenen, though, is unrepentant. 'Things that go wrong,' he says, 'will have to be fixed.' But how to fix them and restore Hassler's form? Angela, points out Bild, remains Hassler's agent. 'She and Geenan could sort out some details of a big new contract while they are in bed,' suggest the paper. </p> <p> <strong> Palace clean up</strong> <br> Crystal Palace - despite it all - have won something: independent internet site of the year. The Football Unlimited award, judged by Observer, Guardian and When Saturday Comes writers, means a trip for the site's designers to a top Serie A game.

      "bodyText": "Graham 'notorious' - Davis Paul Davis - former Arsenal hero, now youth team coach - has revealed how George Graham banned players from using agents at Highbury during his years in charge - at the same time as taking huge backhanders from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge. Davis, in a strong attack on Graham ahead of today's game with Liverpool, also criticised his former manager for driving out senior players and alienating young Andy Cole. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, though, is commended for being, by way of contrast, 'nice'. 'The influence of reputable agents, on the whole, is good for players now,' says Davis. 'But back then Graham would say: \"No I'm not talking to any agents.\" He would allow a parent to sit in on meetings, but they were never the best people to represent the player. It happened a lot. 'Arsenal players at the time took things they didn't like passively. Because I was a senior player and not content and voiced my opinion he eased me out. The other seniors were people like Steve Williams, Charlie Nicholas, Graham Rix and Kenny Sansom. George moved them on very quickly and I was the only one who stayed.' The same approach also led to Graham releasing Andy Cole to Bristol City. 'I tried to encourage Andy to stay but he didn't get on with management. He was quiet and single-minded and that lack of communication didn't help the situation. He had a personality clash with Graham and had it been a different manager, like Wenger, he might have stayed.' Davis also says Wenger was not serious when he conceded the title to Manchester United last weekend. 'Wenger is nice and expresses himself in a quiet, articulate way. He was only kidding - he likes playing mind games. 'Arsenal are still capable of winning it, especially if we beat Liverpool [today]. Of course, it's up to United to keep dropping points, but it's far, far from over.' The icon, his wife and the director Scandal at 1860 Munich. Before the Bundesliga's midwinter break, the German club were on a high: fourth in the league, playing flowing football and beating deadly rivals Bayern for the first time in more than 20 years. But since the restart things have all fallen apart: two humiliating defeats against minnows Wolfsburg (1-2) and Ulm (0-3) have ruined the club's most promising season for years. Sex, inevitably, is to blame. According to the German tabloid Bild , the team fell apart after the wife of icon Thomas Hassler was caught in bed with the club's sporting director. Now the affair, which began between Angela (31) and director Edgar Geenen (46) in January, has hit every aspect of the club's operations. Distraught Hassler has begun playing dreadfully, and the players and fans are threatening revolt unless Geenen is sacked. Geenen, though, is unrepentant. 'Things that go wrong,' he says, 'will have to be fixed.' But how to fix them and restore Hassler's form? Angela, points out Bild, remains Hassler's agent. 'She and Geenan could sort out some details of a big new contract while they are in bed,' suggest the paper. Palace clean up Crystal Palace - despite it all - have won something: independent internet site of the year. The Football Unlimited award, judged by Observer, Guardian and When Saturday Comes writers, means a trip for the site's designers to a top Serie A game.

      "trailText": "<p>Fulham have signed PR guru Max Clifford. Will Buckley hears what he intends to do for Craven Cottage plus views on Glenn Hoddle, Manchester United and the Beckhams.</p>",
      "byline": "Will Buckley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'I hate public relations.' (Pause) 'I loathe public relations.' (Pause) 'I detest public relations.' In such a way did Matthew Parris introduce a programme entitled Bad Ideas of the Twentieth Century. He had a point. It is hard not to sigh when the phone rings and a public relations executive - and however junior they're always executives - spouts away down the other end. They make a living, in the main, by peddling the blindingly obvious. And you have to pretend to be interested, sometimes fascinated, in what they have to say. It's very tiring. Little wonder Matthew Parris found it so hard to keep his loathing under control. </p> <p>But then there's Max Clifford. He has been called 'a sewer' by the Daily Telegraph's Janet Daley, 'that little turd' by Edwina Currie, 'a sleazeball's sleazeball' by David Mellor who, even by his amazing standards, pompously wrote about Clifford, 'I should recall some sage advice I was given at the Foreign Office - never get into a pissing competition with a skunk.' A PR receiving bad PR - that's more interesting. Except, of course, to be slagged off by a bunch of Tories has for a while been excellent, gold-plated, top-of-the-range publicity. Certainly more than sufficient to outweigh any qualms raised by his association with clients such as OJ Simpson. </p> <p>We meet at his home in Walton-on-Thames. It is on a salubrious estate but is not at all flash or glitzy. All the pictures are of Max with his family. There isn't one of him with a celebrity. For someone in his field this is remarkable. They usually define themselves by their clients and fill their walls with pictures of their shoulders rubbing against those of their celebrated pals. The only famous name and telephone number on Clifford's walls is Mr Blair.... and he's the local plumber. </p> <p>Clifford has recently been appointed by his old mucker Mohamed Al-Fayed - 'We get on so well because we beat them at their own game' - to 'get involved in a media capacity' with Fulham. 'Football has changed so much, and the media impact on the game has become greater. It's common sense to bring in someone who knows the field.' But don't Fulham already have a good image? 'Yes, they're many people's second favourite club. But with success the picture becomes different and Mo is hoping they will be one of the most successful clubs in the country.' </p> <p>Clifford used to support Fulham as a boy. His hero was Johnny Haynes and in more fanciful moments he compares his PR work to Haynes's midfield work - creating something out of nothing, splitting the defence with a pass, and allowing someone else to score a goal. At about the same time, he started his PR career by playing water-polo and then being paid for writing up his own exploits in match-reports for the local paper. He might have become a journalist but, by his own estimation, wasn't cynical enough. </p> <p>Instead it was public relations. In his early career at EMI Clifford represented the Beatles before they were famous and later many others - Antonia de Sancha, Bienvenida Buck et al - who became famous only because of his efforts. His first client was Don Partridge who had one hit with Rosie, presumed to be about his girlfriend but in fact about a transvestite who used to hang around Soho mincing, 'I'm Rosie, chase me.' Don is now on his fifth or sixth marriage, still drops in on the Cliffords out of the blue, and is still touring Scandinavia. </p> <p>Nearly 30 years on, Clifford is making his football debut. He claims never to have represented a footballer or football manager, not even George Graham, but also claims to possess 'a vivid imagination and an ability to lie with conviction.' Why has it taken so long? </p> <p>'I was approached by other clubs, but they didn't interest me because the people involved came from a different century. Football has only just started to wake up to the need for PR. The Royal Family only woke up to the fact two years ago and the Tories still haven't worked it out.' While talking to him it soon becomes apparent that if football had been less dozy and Clifford had been approached by various stars then things might have turned out differently for them. Here is how he would have handled some of the major stories of the last year: </p> <p><strong> Glenn Hoddle:</strong> 'I'd have said \"Glenn, I know what you mean but if you say it this way you will destroy yourself.\" Then I'd have tapped into all the disabled groups that he's worked for and got that across. He shouldn't have had to go - although there used to be an arrogance about the way he played and there's an arrogance about the way he comes across.' </p> <p><strong> United in Rio:</strong> 'Manchester United justified their FA Cup exit and the devaluation of that competition by claiming that it was very important PR for the 2006 World Cup bid. When it turns out to be an abysmal PR exercise they can't complain and say we're here to play football. Although, admittedly, Martin Edwards employed his own particular brand of PR to build relations with the local community. Honestly, for Martin Edwards to go to Brazil and then be surprised when he is caught out is unreal.' </p> <p><strong> United generally:</strong> 'It's increasingly obvious that Manchester United have a very resentful relationship with the media. In particular, Alex Ferguson has a hate-hate relationship with the media. This can only lead to aggravation and problems. The problem is that football clubs only understand football. End of story.' </p> <p><strong> Those Beckhams:</strong> 'David Beckham needs protection and he's not getting it. Footballers are the new pop stars and there should be someone doing for him what we did for the Beatles, protecting him and teaching him the media game. By all accounts he's a nice lad, but he has a manager who doesn't help him handle the media and a wife who's a headline-grabber. The more he turns things over inside his head, particularly if he feels he's being unfairly represented all the time, the more likely he is to behave petulantly on the pitch.' </p> <p><strong> Football generally:</strong> It should not be about take, take, take. Forget PR, footballers should want to have a kick-around and visit kids in hospital. The more they put back the better it is for them, the people, the club. The growing problem in the game today is that people and clubs are starting to lose touch with the ordinary people who are the back bone of the game. They need to get more women and more families involved. The FA could and should be doing a lot more. They don't seem to understand the problems and what you have to do.' </p> <p>This sounds like a pitch for new business but Clifford maintains he doesn't pitch; he waits for clients to come to him. Then it comes down to how much he likes them, whether they will take his advice and whether they trust him. 'The whole art of my business is knowing more about my client than anyone else,' he says. Such an approach is unlikely to attract star footballers. One, because they tend to be distrustful of outsiders. Two, because Clifford, unusually for a PR, doesn't appear to be all that taken with celebrities. He fell out with dour magician David Copperfield because when required to be ceaselessly sycophantic he couldn't resist winding him up. 'The better I got to know him, the less I wanted to.' </p> <p>His business, which was once about promotion, is now more about protection. The footballers who are likely to come to him are those who are trying to avoid the press rather than plug themselves within it. Perhaps a player who was about to be outed as gay? </p> <p>'If the story was definitely coming out I'd say to him you've got no choice, we have to make the best of a bad situation. You know that a footballer will get a very difficult time and it will be up to him with your help to try and win over the public. We all know how difficult that will be. We've all stood on the terraces. The thing to do is to try and endear him to the public.

      "bodyText": "'I hate public relations.' (Pause) 'I loathe public relations.' (Pause) 'I detest public relations.' In such a way did Matthew Parris introduce a programme entitled Bad Ideas of the Twentieth Century. He had a point. It is hard not to sigh when the phone rings and a public relations executive - and however junior they're always executives - spouts away down the other end. They make a living, in the main, by peddling the blindingly obvious. And you have to pretend to be interested, sometimes fascinated, in what they have to say. It's very tiring. Little wonder Matthew Parris found it so hard to keep his loathing under control. But then there's Max Clifford. He has been called 'a sewer' by the Daily Telegraph's Janet Daley, 'that little turd' by Edwina Currie, 'a sleazeball's sleazeball' by David Mellor who, even by his amazing standards, pompously wrote about Clifford, 'I should recall some sage advice I was given at the Foreign Office - never get into a pissing competition with a skunk.' A PR receiving bad PR - that's more interesting. Except, of course, to be slagged off by a bunch of Tories has for a while been excellent, gold-plated, top-of-the-range publicity. Certainly more than sufficient to outweigh any qualms raised by his association with clients such as OJ Simpson. We meet at his home in Walton-on-Thames. It is on a salubrious estate but is not at all flash or glitzy. All the pictures are of Max with his family. There isn't one of him with a celebrity. For someone in his field this is remarkable. They usually define themselves by their clients and fill their walls with pictures of their shoulders rubbing against those of their celebrated pals. The only famous name and telephone number on Clifford's walls is Mr Blair.... and he's the local plumber. Clifford has recently been appointed by his old mucker Mohamed Al-Fayed - 'We get on so well because we beat them at their own game' - to 'get involved in a media capacity' with Fulham. 'Football has changed so much, and the media impact on the game has become greater. It's common sense to bring in someone who knows the field.' But don't Fulham already have a good image? 'Yes, they're many people's second favourite club. But with success the picture becomes different and Mo is hoping they will be one of the most successful clubs in the country.' Clifford used to support Fulham as a boy. His hero was Johnny Haynes and in more fanciful moments he compares his PR work to Haynes's midfield work - creating something out of nothing, splitting the defence with a pass, and allowing someone else to score a goal. At about the same time, he started his PR career by playing water-polo and then being paid for writing up his own exploits in match-reports for the local paper. He might have become a journalist but, by his own estimation, wasn't cynical enough. Instead it was public relations. In his early career at EMI Clifford represented the Beatles before they were famous and later many others - Antonia de Sancha, Bienvenida Buck et al - who became famous only because of his efforts. His first client was Don Partridge who had one hit with Rosie, presumed to be about his girlfriend but in fact about a transvestite who used to hang around Soho mincing, 'I'm Rosie, chase me.' Don is now on his fifth or sixth marriage, still drops in on the Cliffords out of the blue, and is still touring Scandinavia. Nearly 30 years on, Clifford is making his football debut. He claims never to have represented a footballer or football manager, not even George Graham, but also claims to possess 'a vivid imagination and an ability to lie with conviction.' Why has it taken so long? 'I was approached by other clubs, but they didn't interest me because the people involved came from a different century. Football has only just started to wake up to the need for PR. The Royal Family only woke up to the fact two years ago and the Tories still haven't worked it out.' While talking to him it soon becomes apparent that if football had been less dozy and Clifford had been approached by various stars then things might have turned out differently for them. Here is how he would have handled some of the major stories of the last year: Glenn Hoddle: 'I'd have said \"Glenn, I know what you mean but if you say it this way you will destroy yourself.\" Then I'd have tapped into all the disabled groups that he's worked for and got that across. He shouldn't have had to go - although there used to be an arrogance about the way he played and there's an arrogance about the way he comes across.' United in Rio: 'Manchester United justified their FA Cup exit and the devaluation of that competition by claiming that it was very important PR for the 2006 World Cup bid. When it turns out to be an abysmal PR exercise they can't complain and say we're here to play football. Although, admittedly, Martin Edwards employed his own particular brand of PR to build relations with the local community. Honestly, for Martin Edwards to go to Brazil and then be surprised when he is caught out is unreal.' United generally: 'It's increasingly obvious that Manchester United have a very resentful relationship with the media. In particular, Alex Ferguson has a hate-hate relationship with the media. This can only lead to aggravation and problems. The problem is that football clubs only understand football. End of story.' Those Beckhams: 'David Beckham needs protection and he's not getting it. Footballers are the new pop stars and there should be someone doing for him what we did for the Beatles, protecting him and teaching him the media game. By all accounts he's a nice lad, but he has a manager who doesn't help him handle the media and a wife who's a headline-grabber. The more he turns things over inside his head, particularly if he feels he's being unfairly represented all the time, the more likely he is to behave petulantly on the pitch.' Football generally: It should not be about take, take, take. Forget PR, footballers should want to have a kick-around and visit kids in hospital. The more they put back the better it is for them, the people, the club. The growing problem in the game today is that people and clubs are starting to lose touch with the ordinary people who are the back bone of the game. They need to get more women and more families involved. The FA could and should be doing a lot more. They don't seem to understand the problems and what you have to do.' This sounds like a pitch for new business but Clifford maintains he doesn't pitch; he waits for clients to come to him. Then it comes down to how much he likes them, whether they will take his advice and whether they trust him. 'The whole art of my business is knowing more about my client than anyone else,' he says. Such an approach is unlikely to attract star footballers. One, because they tend to be distrustful of outsiders. Two, because Clifford, unusually for a PR, doesn't appear to be all that taken with celebrities. He fell out with dour magician David Copperfield because when required to be ceaselessly sycophantic he couldn't resist winding him up. 'The better I got to know him, the less I wanted to.' His business, which was once about promotion, is now more about protection. The footballers who are likely to come to him are those who are trying to avoid the press rather than plug themselves within it. Perhaps a player who was about to be outed as gay? 'If the story was definitely coming out I'd say to him you've got no choice, we have to make the best of a bad situation. You know that a footballer will get a very difficult time and it will be up to him with your help to try and win over the public. We all know how difficult that will be. We've all stood on the terraces. The thing to do is to try and endear him to the public. Have a sense of humour about it.' This is a quality markedly absent among those that play for and those that run football clubs. A shame, really, instead of reading about Newcastle board members' taste in prostitutes, we might have enjoyed headlines such as 'Freddie Shepherd ate my hamster'.",

      "body": "<p>Somewhere in northern Malaysia there are 12 teenaged footballers living in one large room and hoping to be selected to play for the local team so that someone will notice them and give them a contract. They are not being paid. </p> <p>Somewhere in Holland an illegal immigrant is sleeping on the floor of one of the country's top agents, living on no more than expenses and again hoping for a deal at any club that can pay him a decent wage. </p> <p>And somewhere in Spain there's a footballer who does have a contract, but not the one he thought he was signing, which would have taken him to Real Mallorca. His paperwork ties him for 10 years to a company, not a club, and he has already been moved to two second-division sides he had no interest in playing for. His pay is so poor he has been home to try to coax some money out of the club who sold him. </p> <p>All these players are from Ghana, and there are hundreds more from other African countries dotted around the world. One of them, a 17-year-old international prospect from Togo, has disappeared altogether after signing up for a Swiss agent. His country wanted him for Olympic duty but no one has heard of him for four months. </p> <p>All are victims of what the top man in African football calls 'a hideous slave trade' that plunders the continent. It started slowly in the late Eighties when African teams started to excel at the under-17 and under-20 World Cups, and the players are moving ever younger - many of them 15 and 16. Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), is scathing about agents and the youth academies springing up all over Africa. He backs up his argument by recalling the 1998 Belgian government inquiry into a 'slave trade' scandal in which club directors signed up young players as their personal property from which to make as much profit as possible. </p> <p>Sepp Blatter, president of Fifa, agrees with Hayatou. 'It's time to fight against the exodus of young players to Europe,' he told The Observer. 'We must create an age barrier before which a player cannot be transferred to another continent.' He promises new regulations by the end of June, after which no player under the age of 18 will be allowed to transfer to Europe. But there will be legal problems with such a ban and there is a flaw in the slave-trade argument - because many of the 'slaves' earn more than \u00a320,000 a week and hundreds are on a six-figure salary. </p> <p>Roger Milla, Africa's most famous player, is not so forthright. 'Perhaps it's not normal for players to move to Europe when they're 15 or 16, but if you don't get paid in your own league, or you are paid very little, you'll want to move somewhere where you can get rich,' he says. The two main reasons to move early, explains Milla, are the hopeless state of domestic leagues and national FAs that allow clubs to get away with not paying their players on time, or paying less than agreed; and the families. 'A young player in Europe can send money back to his extended family,' says Milla. 'That's very important. It means far more than most Europeans can imagine.' </p> <p>The point is emphasised outside her home by Gloria Osei Kuffour, the wealthiest grandmother on the Ainet Road in Kumasi, Ghana. Ten years ago she was no better off than any of her neighbours in this busy shopping area; then one of her four children, Samuel, was taken away from her. In 1991 a European agent caused a sensation by selling Samuel and two of his team-mates in Ghana's under-17 team to Torino. There was uproar in Italy because the players were so young. </p> <p>Gloria remembers it well. 'Was I sad when he went. Sad? No, I was happy. Very, very happy.' But wasn't he a slave? She throws back her head and laughs, loudly. Gloria answers these questions while standing next to her BMW, having recently returned from a trip to Germany, where Samuel now plays for Bayern Munich. 'When Samuel was a young boy he was very good at football and I wanted to help him. I sold our television to pay for some boots, and the other children didn't complain because they wanted to help him too. I always pray to God to help my son become a big man. I helped him... now he can help me.' </p> <p>Gloria has discussed this with the mother of Tony Yeboah, once a Leeds striker, who left Ghana for Germany when he was a teenager and plays now for Hamburg. Life was hard for Yeboah, who spoke no German or English, but his mother was 'very, very happy too,' said Gloria, a football lover who supports her local club and watches Samuel play for the national team when she can. </p> <p>Kuffour himself is not sure Fifa are doing the right thing. 'It's every man for himself,' he says. 'I'm very happy with the way things turned out for me. I'm able to look after my family very well, I play for one of the best clubs in the world - I can't complain about anything.' </p> <p>The other two who signed for Torino have also prospered in Europe. Mohammed Gargo, Kuffour's partner in central defence for Ghana, is earning Serie A money at Udinese - who have half a dozen young Africans in their youth team - and Emmanuel Duah has ended up at Leiria in Portugal. 'They've got no complaints,' said Kuffour. </p> <p>He is more than happy with the man who did that controversial deal, Domenico Ricci, who is still his agent nearly 10 years later. Ricci's company, African Football Management, is probably the most active in the market - or at least the respectable part of it - and has been the target of much of Hayatou's invective. Ricci, an Italian who is married to a Zairean, has 60 African players in Europe but sees himself as anything but a 'slave trader'. </p> <p>He laughs off much of the criticism and turns the argument around to blame Fifa and CAF for introducing a 'racist law' themselves - the regulation that requires licensed international player agents to post a bond of 200,000 Swiss francs (about \u00a380,000). His point is a good one when one trawls the official Fifa list of 534 licensed agents. There's one in Egypt, and for the continent of Africa that's it. More than 300 African players in the top division of western Europe's best leagues, many hundreds more at lower levels around the world - and not a single black African agent on their own continent. </p> <p>Not that that stops Africans doing deals. France and the USA have licensed agents from Africa, and there are unofficial 'local managers' doing deals with the Europeans. In eight days in Ghana I was asked three times if I was an agent, and if I wasn't did I want to have a go anyway and sell players in Europe. Telephone numbers were foisted upon me, and one man almost begged me to extend my stay and take up his offer. </p> <p>'Sure, there are good agents and bad agents,' says Ricci, 46. 'Some of the unlicensed locals have no real idea how to operate, and some of the Europeans are unreliable too. But it's no good Hayatou and his executive at CAF just blaming the agents for taking money out of the game. If there's an exodus to Europe they should first of all be asking: Why? CAF is hiding behind reality. The young players are leaving because in Africa there's no money, too little competition. They should be working to make the whole structure of African football more professional. Hayatou says we're taking away, but we're investing. And look at CAF - they're not working for the development of African football, they just want as many years as possible on the Fifa or CAF executive so they can make more money and build a bigger house. </p> <p>'What have they done to help African agents? The bond is too expensive. The Fifa agent law is racist and CAF should have done something about it when it was introduced. They need African agents to work with the African mentality, but CAF are only interested in lining their own pockets.' </p> <p>They are not the only ones. The chairmen of professional leagues in South Africa and Cameroon have ended up in jail, and four of the top five officials at the Ghana FA have recently been found guilty of corruption in transfer deals. A Ghanaian club owner declared a transfer at $250,000 when he received $800,0000 - and this sort of thing is commonplace. </p> <p>One man who knows all about the subject is Prof Pierre Lanfranchi, an expert in the development of football worldwide and a consultant to Fifa. 'National federations cannot even build a middle-term plan for development,' says Lanfranchi, Regius Professor of history at De Montfort University, Leicester. 'There are absolutely no foundations to the professional game in Africa.' Fifa aim to start putting those foundations in place by keeping promising young players at home, at least for another couple of years.The plan is that this will raise standards and attract sponsorship. 'At least it's worth a try,' says Blatter. </p> <p>Ricci, who played for Cagliari and Torino in the Italian second division before coaching in Zaire, says the boys he sold to Torino were all old enough and happy enough to move. </p> <p>'Is a boy going to refuse a move like that?' asks Ricci at his office in Brussels. 'You cannot compare Africans to young players in, say, Russia, Norway or Croatia, who can stay in their own leagues until they're 20 and beyond and still learn a lot. If you stay on as a professional in Africa till you're 22, you'll never get to Europe. The infrastructure is so poor - coaching, pitches, equipment, travelling, administration - that you'll have no chance of developing.' </p> <p>The benefits to Africa of players moving to Europe, says Ricci, are slowly beginning to surface. When a player returns to Africa he can help. 'The leagues have improved in the last 10 years, because the links to Europe are closer,' says Ricci, who believes the best are in South Africa ('which has an infrastructure and is completely unlike the rest of the continent'), Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Ghana. </p> <p>If Nigeria is one of the best, it still has its problems. Of the 17 clubs in the top division only one, Julius Berger FC, paid their players their full wages on time last season. Julius Berger was also the only club to have a home-based player in the squad of 22 for the Nations Cup, which Nigeria hope to win against Cameroon today. Apart from one in Tunisia, all the others earn thousands of pounds a week in Europe. </p> <p>A visit to a boys' game at Nsawom, a run-down town of shacks and rusty corrugated iron near Accra, showed what the boys must overcome to make it to the top. The pitch, hemmed in by school buildings and a community centre, was 90 per cent red dust and 10 per cent grass, and was unmarked. There was a dry stream bed running the length of the sloping, pot-holed pitch. The goals were knocked up from off-cuts and the crossbars sagged markedly. Both goalkeepers were barefoot. When a defender went in for a tackle - and how they flew in to the challenge - he would emerge with the ball from a great cloud of dust. Yet the level of skill was exceptional. </p> <p>They were lucky to have a ball according to Abedi Pele, former African Footballer of the Year and the best player to have come out of Ghana. 'When I was a boy we played on dirt with a bunch of rags for a ball,' he says. The club who sold him, Tamale, have clearly not made enough to plough back into the grass roots; they have no grass. They play all their matches on gravel and have the worst facilities in the Ghanaian league. </p> <p>Abedi and Ricci are agreed with Fifa that investing in youth football is the best way to bring about long-term improvement. And that's what they are doing, along with many other individuals and top European clubs. As with the agents, there are good and bad youth academies opening up all over the continent. Abedi has just opened one near Accra, Ricci's company have four in West Africa, Cameroon's state brewery has set up an academy, there's another nearby run by a Greek club owner, and the big money is coming from Ajax (Ghana and South Africa), and throughout West Africa Feyenoord, Paris St Germain and Monaco. English clubs have yet to catch on, though Manchester United have bought a controlling interest in Fortune FC, the South African second-division side previously bankrolled by Quinton Fortune, and one of Arsenal's international scouts has had a look at how things work in Cameroon. An English-backed academy cannot be far away. One top-class player every five years would cover the running costs. </p> <p>These academies, if well run like the Ajax set-up at Obuasi, will offer boys not only top coaching, but an education. There will be structured schooling, occasional visits to Europe and, whether the Fifa age barrier works or not, the boys will at least be well prepared to move on. </p> <p>'We must leave the players here until they're older,' says Blatter. 'If the young players remain it will be the first step in attracting investment in football here.' </p> <p>Gloria Kuffour, meanwhile, has a message to the mothers of Africa. 'I want all of you to help your boys learn football. Help them. Give them everything you can.'</p>",

It started slowly in the late Eighties when African teams started to excel at the under-17 and under-20 World Cups, and the players are moving ever younger - many of them 15 and 16. Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), is scathing about agents and the youth academies springing up all over Africa. He backs up his argument by recalling the 1998 Belgian government inquiry into a 'slave trade' scandal in which club directors signed up young players as their personal property from which to make as much profit as possible. Sepp Blatter, president of Fifa, agrees with Hayatou. 'It's time to fight against the exodus of young players to Europe,' he told The Observer. 'We must create an age barrier before which a player cannot be transferred to another continent.' He promises new regulations by the end of June, after which no player under the age of 18 will be allowed to transfer to Europe. But there will be legal problems with such a ban and there is a flaw in the slave-trade argument - because many of the 'slaves' earn more than \u00a320,000 a week and hundreds are on a six-figure salary. Roger Milla, Africa's most famous player, is not so forthright. 'Perhaps it's not normal for players to move to Europe when they're 15 or 16, but if you don't get paid in your own league, or you are paid very little, you'll want to move somewhere where you can get rich,' he says. The two main reasons to move early, explains Milla, are the hopeless state of domestic leagues and national FAs that allow clubs to get away with not paying their players on time, or paying less than agreed; and the families. 'A young player in Europe can send money back to his extended family,' says Milla. 'That's very important. It means far more than most Europeans can imagine.' The point is emphasised outside her home by Gloria Osei Kuffour, the wealthiest grandmother on the Ainet Road in Kumasi, Ghana. Ten years ago she was no better off than any of her neighbours in this busy shopping area; then one of her four children, Samuel, was taken away from her. In 1991 a European agent caused a sensation by selling Samuel and two of his team-mates in Ghana's under-17 team to Torino. There was uproar in Italy because the players were so young. Gloria remembers it well. 'Was I sad when he went. Sad? No, I was happy. Very, very happy.' But wasn't he a slave? She throws back her head and laughs, loudly. Gloria answers these questions while standing next to her BMW, having recently returned from a trip to Germany, where Samuel now plays for Bayern Munich. 'When Samuel was a young boy he was very good at football and I wanted to help him. I sold our television to pay for some boots, and the other children didn't complain because they wanted to help him too. I always pray to God to help my son become a big man. I helped him... now he can help me.' Gloria has discussed this with the mother of Tony Yeboah, once a Leeds striker, who left Ghana for Germany when he was a teenager and plays now for Hamburg. Life was hard for Yeboah, who spoke no German or English, but his mother was 'very, very happy too,' said Gloria, a football lover who supports her local club and watches Samuel play for the national team when she can. Kuffour himself is not sure Fifa are doing the right thing. 'It's every man for himself,' he says. 'I'm very happy with the way things turned out for me. I'm able to look after my family very well, I play for one of the best clubs in the world - I can't complain about anything.' The other two who signed for Torino have also prospered in Europe. Mohammed Gargo, Kuffour's partner in central defence for Ghana, is earning Serie A money at Udinese - who have half a dozen young Africans in their youth team - and Emmanuel Duah has ended up at Leiria in Portugal. 'They've got no complaints,' said Kuffour. He is more than happy with the man who did that controversial deal, Domenico Ricci, who is still his agent nearly 10 years later. Ricci's company, African Football Management, is probably the most active in the market - or at least the respectable part of it - and has been the target of much of Hayatou's invective. Ricci, an Italian who is married to a Zairean, has 60 African players in Europe but sees himself as anything but a 'slave trader'. He laughs off much of the criticism and turns the argument around to blame Fifa and CAF for introducing a 'racist law' themselves - the regulation that requires licensed international player agents to post a bond of 200,000 Swiss francs (about \u00a380,000). His point is a good one when one trawls the official Fifa list of 534 licensed agents. There's one in Egypt, and for the continent of Africa that's it. More than 300 African players in the top division of western Europe's best leagues, many hundreds more at lower levels around the world - and not a single black African agent on their own continent. Not that that stops Africans doing deals. France and the USA have licensed agents from Africa, and there are unofficial 'local managers' doing deals with the Europeans. In eight days in Ghana I was asked three times if I was an agent, and if I wasn't did I want to have a go anyway and sell players in Europe. Telephone numbers were foisted upon me, and one man almost begged me to extend my stay and take up his offer. 'Sure, there are good agents and bad agents,' says Ricci, 46. 'Some of the unlicensed locals have no real idea how to operate, and some of the Europeans are unreliable too. But it's no good Hayatou and his executive at CAF just blaming the agents for taking money out of the game. If there's an exodus to Europe they should first of all be asking: Why? CAF is hiding behind reality. The young players are leaving because in Africa there's no money, too little competition. They should be working to make the whole structure of African football more professional. Hayatou says we're taking away, but we're investing. And look at CAF - they're not working for the development of African football, they just want as many years as possible on the Fifa or CAF executive so they can make more money and build a bigger house. 'What have they done to help African agents? The bond is too expensive. The Fifa agent law is racist and CAF should have done something about it when it was introduced. They need African agents to work with the African mentality, but CAF are only interested in lining their own pockets.' They are not the only ones. The chairmen of professional leagues in South Africa and Cameroon have ended up in jail, and four of the top five officials at the Ghana FA have recently been found guilty of corruption in transfer deals. A Ghanaian club owner declared a transfer at $250,000 when he received $800,0000 - and this sort of thing is commonplace. One man who knows all about the subject is Prof Pierre Lanfranchi, an expert in the development of football worldwide and a consultant to Fifa. 'National federations cannot even build a middle-term plan for development,' says Lanfranchi, Regius Professor of history at De Montfort University, Leicester. 'There are absolutely no foundations to the professional game in Africa.' Fifa aim to start putting those foundations in place by keeping promising young players at home, at least for another couple of years.The plan is that this will raise standards and attract sponsorship. 'At least it's worth a try,' says Blatter. Ricci, who played for Cagliari and Torino in the Italian second division before coaching in Zaire, says the boys he sold to Torino were all old enough and happy enough to move. 'Is a boy going to refuse a move like that?' asks Ricci at his office in Brussels. 'You cannot compare Africans to young players in, say, Russia, Norway or Croatia, who can stay in their own leagues until they're 20 and beyond and still learn a lot. If you stay on as a professional in Africa till you're 22, you'll never get to Europe. The infrastructure is so poor - coaching, pitches, equipment, travelling, administration - that you'll have no chance of developing.' The benefits to Africa of players moving to Europe, says Ricci, are slowly beginning to surface. When a player returns to Africa he can help. 'The leagues have improved in the last 10 years, because the links to Europe are closer,' says Ricci, who believes the best are in South Africa ('which has an infrastructure and is completely unlike the rest of the continent'), Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Ghana. If Nigeria is one of the best, it still has its problems. Of the 17 clubs in the top division only one, Julius Berger FC, paid their players their full wages on time last season. Julius Berger was also the only club to have a home-based player in the squad of 22 for the Nations Cup, which Nigeria hope to win against Cameroon today. Apart from one in Tunisia, all the others earn thousands of pounds a week in Europe. A visit to a boys' game at Nsawom, a run-down town of shacks and rusty corrugated iron near Accra, showed what the boys must overcome to make it to the top. The pitch, hemmed in by school buildings and a community centre, was 90 per cent red dust and 10 per cent grass, and was unmarked. There was a dry stream bed running the length of the sloping, pot-holed pitch. The goals were knocked up from off-cuts and the crossbars sagged markedly. Both goalkeepers were barefoot. When a defender went in for a tackle - and how they flew in to the challenge - he would emerge with the ball from a great cloud of dust. Yet the level of skill was exceptional. They were lucky to have a ball according to Abedi Pele, former African Footballer of the Year and the best player to have come out of Ghana. 'When I was a boy we played on dirt with a bunch of rags for a ball,' he says. The club who sold him, Tamale, have clearly not made enough to plough back into the grass roots; they have no grass. They play all their matches on gravel and have the worst facilities in the Ghanaian league. Abedi and Ricci are agreed with Fifa that investing in youth football is the best way to bring about long-term improvement. And that's what they are doing, along with many other individuals and top European clubs. As with the agents, there are good and bad youth academies opening up all over the continent. Abedi has just opened one near Accra, Ricci's company have four in West Africa, Cameroon's state brewery has set up an academy, there's another nearby run by a Greek club owner, and the big money is coming from Ajax (Ghana and South Africa), and throughout West Africa Feyenoord, Paris St Germain and Monaco. English clubs have yet to catch on, though Manchester United have bought a controlling interest in Fortune FC, the South African second-division side previously bankrolled by Quinton Fortune, and one of Arsenal's international scouts has had a look at how things work in Cameroon. An English-backed academy cannot be far away. One top-class player every five years would cover the running costs. These academies, if well run like the Ajax set-up at Obuasi, will offer boys not only top coaching, but an education. There will be structured schooling, occasional visits to Europe and, whether the Fifa age barrier works or not, the boys will at least be well prepared to move on. 'We must leave the players here until they're older,' says Blatter. 'If the young players remain it will be the first step in attracting investment in football here.' Gloria Kuffour, meanwhile, has a message to the mothers of Africa. 'I want all of you to help your boys learn football. Help them. Give them everything you can.'",

That was just a lie, and no one will ever believe the authorities again when they tell us 'don't travel without a ticket because you won't get one'. But that won't stop them telling us. They will probably also tell us that you can only get tickets through an official Euro 2000 package or the England Members Club.

The majority of England fans in France were not in the Members Club and probably wouldn't want to be. The fact is that it is now fairly easy to get tickets from other sources. If you want you can even get tickets for the Germany game in the German end. Ex-Olympic athlete Ainslie Bennett's corporate hospitality company have been openly advertising them, and tickets for England's other games. But as we move closer to the opening of Euro 2000 we can expect all sorts of exaltations from the Government and the FA. Remember those Government adverts on the telly before the World Cup in France when we were told that if your name was not on the ticket then you wouldn't get in? That was just a lie, and no one will ever believe the authorities again when they tell us 'don't travel without a ticket because you won't get one'. But that won't stop them telling us. They will probably also tell us that you can only get tickets through an official Euro 2000 package or the England Members Club. I'll bet that in a few weeks' time Jack 'Boot' Straw will announce a 'hooligan summit' and announce that there will be tough new measures to deal with hooligans. This will be good PR, but just as new measures failed for the World Cup in France they will probably not work for Euro 2000. The Government is simply not serious about doing anything, just keen to be seen to be doing something. Yet with the decision on England's bid for the 2006 World Cup coming so soon after Euro 2000, so much will depend on the fans' behaviour. With all the national newspapers and broadcasters sending out special 'Hoolie Watch' reporters the FA and the Government must be hoping that hostility to the German bid will lead to a 'toning down' of media reports on the inevitable outbreaks of violence.",

Last night he was duly left as sick as a parrot as his side surrendered a lead to an off-colour Chelsea fortunate to claim three points. </p> <p>Olsen's latest signing from his homeland, Andreas Lund, put the Dons ahead on his debut but late goals by Gustavo Poyet, George Weah and the substitute Jody Morris gave the scoreline an unjust look to increase Wimbledon's woes in the bottom half of the table and keep Chelsea's recent momentum going. </p> <p>The Dons had deserved it but Chelsea were stung, quickly responding with two goals in two minutes. First, Emerson Thome slung forward a hopeful ball which Weah headed back to Poyet for a fierce volley home, out of the blue, from 20 yards. Then Gianfranco Zola found Morris with a neat pass and from his cross, Weah rose unmarked at the far post to head home. </p> <p>Finally, the turnaround was complete when Zola teed up Morris to drive home a powerful shot from 22 yards. It was a contest of contrast; one side in form and on the way up having recorded 10 games unbeaten, the other slipping towards the relegation zone after losing three of their last four games. At least, that was the billing. </p> <p>There was a time when Wimbledon would have come here scenting blood and points, Chelsea uncomfortable under their high ball onslaught. This is not quite the same club, however, and also being short of confidence and long on injuries meant that the Dons were content to contain rather than put Chelsea under pressure. Consequently, where Wimbledon might once have supplied such a tall centre-forward as Lund, signed in midweek - apparently for \u00a32.5 million - with a series of crosses, now he had to operate alone ahead of a five-man midfield. </p> <p>Dining off scraps, in the shape of hopeful balls pumped up to him, he still managed to impress fitfully, working manfully in the team's cause. Twice in the first half he pulled away from Frank Leboeuf to get in headers from right-wing crosses but so eager to shine was he that he sent both well wide. </p> <p>That and a scuffed volley by Robbie Earle was more than Chelsea managed in the opening 45 minutes. Constantly trying to put Weah through, the timing of the pass against Wimbledon's offside trap was mostly wayward and Neil Sullivan went largely untroubled in the visitors' goal. </p> <p>After an hour of such dross, the crowd got its wish when Zola was introduced. At first, it looked as if things were not improving, particularly when Wimbledon took the lead. The substitute Neil Ardley robbed Dennis Wise on the left and from his cross, Carl Cort headed down for Lund to volley home emphatically.</p>",

First, Emerson Thome slung forward a hopeful ball which Weah headed back to Poyet for a fierce volley home, out of the blue, from 20 yards. Then Gianfranco Zola found Morris with a neat pass and from his cross, Weah rose unmarked at the far post to head home. Finally, the turnaround was complete when Zola teed up Morris to drive home a powerful shot from 22 yards. It was a contest of contrast; one side in form and on the way up having recorded 10 games unbeaten, the other slipping towards the relegation zone after losing three of their last four games. At least, that was the billing. There was a time when Wimbledon would have come here scenting blood and points, Chelsea uncomfortable under their high ball onslaught. This is not quite the same club, however, and also being short of confidence and long on injuries meant that the Dons were content to contain rather than put Chelsea under pressure. Consequently, where Wimbledon might once have supplied such a tall centre-forward as Lund, signed in midweek - apparently for \u00a32.5 million - with a series of crosses, now he had to operate alone ahead of a five-man midfield. Dining off scraps, in the shape of hopeful balls pumped up to him, he still managed to impress fitfully, working manfully in the team's cause. Twice in the first half he pulled away from Frank Leboeuf to get in headers from right-wing crosses but so eager to shine was he that he sent both well wide. That and a scuffed volley by Robbie Earle was more than Chelsea managed in the opening 45 minutes. Constantly trying to put Weah through, the timing of the pass against Wimbledon's offside trap was mostly wayward and Neil Sullivan went largely untroubled in the visitors' goal. After an hour of such dross, the crowd got its wish when Zola was introduced. At first, it looked as if things were not improving, particularly when Wimbledon took the lead. The substitute Neil Ardley robbed Dennis Wise on the left and from his cross, Carl Cort headed down for Lund to volley home emphatically.",

Just because he has a famous name, that doesn't mean that he understands the game in the same way that his father did. What it does mean is that he probably needs to work harder than anyone else. However, I feel that if he really wants it badly enough, he has the ability to do well.' </p> <p>But Dalglish had his work cut out to shine at Manchester City, of only because of Norwich's negative approach. Still, he did show his determination, with an early tackle which brought him a booking. As for scoring ability, he was was put in the shade - as was everyone else - by City's Mark Kennedy. </p> <p>The left-winger clinched victory for the home team with two goals in the last 10 minutes. </p> <p>As far as the First Division championship race is concerned, those Kennedy goals were rendered particularly important because of Charlton's win over Wolves and Ipswich's 2-1 victory over Huddersfield. Ipswich owed their success to a goal by Marcus Stewart, who was making only his second appearance for them following his move from - Huddersfield. </p> <p>At the other end, Swindon got a goalless draw at Blackburn - albeit with the help of a large slice of luck. </p> <p>In the first half, especially, Blackburn, had as number of chances to put Swindon firmly in their place.

Christophe Cocard almost did the trick in 65 minutes but Goram dived to his left to save the Frenchman's deflected shot. </p> <p>A minute later Motherwell took the lead against the run of play when Spencer drove the ball through a ruck of defenders low into the net. A disputed free-kick 25 yards out led to Motherwell's second goal in 73 minutes, Stephen McMillan's shot taking a deflection and leaving Meldrum with no chance. </p> <p>The result leaves Kilmarnock a point adrift at the bottom of the Premier League.

Despite that, Kilmarnock still looked the side most likely to score and Mitchell came close with a powerful shot from 20 yards that whistled over Goram's bar. At the other end, Lee McCulloch beat Meldrum to Don Goodman's cross but his header was well off target. Then an angled drive by Michael Jeffrey flew just wide of Goram's right-hand post with the keeper struggling to reach the ball. Kilmarnock opened strongly again after the interval with Durrant and Jeffrey both firing shots at Goram. But in a breakaway shortly afterwards McCulloch should have given the visitors the lead. After being sent clear by Spencer he hit his shot against Meldrum's legs with the goal at his mercy. On 53 minutes, Motherwell were then reduced to ten men when Goodman was yellow-carded twice in three minutes for fouls on Durrant and Gus MacPherson. As Motherwell struggled to keep pace, Kilmarnock continued to dominate but still could not find their way through. Christophe Cocard almost did the trick in 65 minutes but Goram dived to his left to save the Frenchman's deflected shot. A minute later Motherwell took the lead against the run of play when Spencer drove the ball through a ruck of defenders low into the net. A disputed free-kick 25 yards out led to Motherwell's second goal in 73 minutes, Stephen McMillan's shot taking a deflection and leaving Meldrum with no chance. The result leaves Kilmarnock a point adrift at the bottom of the Premier League. Now Williamson has a big task in raising his players' morale for Wednesday night's League Cup semi-final against another team with a great deal to prove, Kenny Dalglish's Celtic.",

A first goal of the season by the captain Phil Parkinson and a solo gem three minutes from the end by Nicky Forster, who ran 40 yards before shooting into the bottom corner, produced a well deserved victory in front of the biggest home crowd since the season's opening day Reading fans have not had much to cheer about this season, but they are certainly not lacking a sense of humour. In the midst of a grim winter run of 13 matches without a league win, they staged a 'pants protest' to mark their displeasure at the team's performances.

Quite clearly there was an edge to a fixture which Millwall won 5-0 at the New Den in November on their way into the top four. Reading manager Alan Pardew said before kick-off: 'Most of my family are from the Bermondsey area and it was a horrible occasion for all of us.' In between the bookings, Nicky Forster, who has struck an immediate understanding with Butler, had a clear shooting chance on the edge of the box but he hit it straight at Tony Warner.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bobby Robson paid Manchester United lavish compliments before this game and must have ended up wondering what all the fuss was about. The bookmaker who has been paying out early on title bets will also be feeling a trifle concerned, particularly as Roy Keane now faces suspension after being dismissed for two bookable offences. </p> <p>This was only Newcastle's second victory over Manchester United in a dozen attempts, but it was instant success for Robson in a much more emphatic manner than anyone had anticipated. Two second half goals by Alan Shearer gave the home side the margin they deserved, Manchester United could easily have conceded more. </p> <p>Surprisingly this was a first competitive meeting for two of the most respected managers in English football, Newcastle's 5-1 thrashing at Old Trafford last August having been caretaker Steve Clarke's only match in charge. Few would deny Newcastle have bucked up their ideas since then, though until this result they have never quite been able to stop worrying about their proximity to the relegation positions. </p> <p>No such problems for Manchester United, six points clear and in the title driving seat, as Robson conceded before the game. To continue the motoring theme the leaders began like one of David Beckham's fanciest possessions being taken through its paces by an eager salesman. Every one of the visitors' attacking options had been demonstrated to Newcastle within the first 10 minutes, as Manchester United pressed forward in numbers and threatened to overrun their opponents with the slick precision of their passing. </p> <p>Only five minutes had elapsed when Teddy Sheringham anticipated a clever ball from Paul Scholes to shoot a couple of feet too high, then Warren Barton rescued his bewildered defence with a timely interception when Sheringham had two men spare on his left. With Andy Cole particularly impressive, chasing an England recall as well as his 100th Manchester United goal, Beckham put a chance over the bar in the 20th minute and saw a threatening cross cut out by Nikolaos Dabizas at the last moment with two attackers shaping for a tap in. </p> <p>Newcastle's own attacking efforts looked primitive in comparison, with some steady build-ups from the back wasted by careless final balls, and the alleged Duncan Ferguson-Alan Shearer partnership looking almost ungainly. That was until the 27th minute, when Newcastle took the lead and the game turned on a moment which made nonsense of all that had gone before. The home side played a ball up in the direction of their twin strikers, as they had been doing all afternoon, but in this occasion Shearer beat Mickael Silvestre and found Ferguson with a headed flick. The big man had his back to goal and was on the edge of the penalty box, but one graceful swing of his left boot later Mark Bosnich was beaten high to his left and the ball was coming to rest in the Manchester United net. There was a slight pause before the roar arrived, as if the crowd had difficulty registering immediately what had just happened. </p> <p>The same appeared to be true of Manchester United, who did not quite fall to pieces after going behind, but could not have complained had they trailed by two or three at the interval. The lively Kieron Dyer saw a deflected shot strike a post four minutes later, Kevin Gallacher shot too high, and Gary Speed missed an inviting target from the edge of the area with Bosnich stranded. Most of the ground actually cheered for that one, not realising the ball had flashed the wrong side of an upright. </p> <p>Keane picked up his first yellow card for dissent in the 45th minute, and there was still time for Shearer to give Ferguson another good shooting chance, although this time his aim was less deadly. </p> <p>Ferguson was withdrawn just past the hour - just before Manchester United objections that a Cole flick had crossed the line by the time Steve Harper dropped on it led to them losing their heads completely. </p> <p>Keane was at pains to offer a sporting handshake to Harper after the pair collided at speed two minutes later, but could have no real objections when a late tackle from behind on Rob Lee brought a second booking in the 65th minute, and neither did he raise any. Cole, however, gave a passable impersonation of his captain's previous style in chasing Stephen Lodge all over the pitch, and was lucky to escape with only an additional yellow. </p> <p>The Shearer show started shortly afterwards, at exactly the point the normally reliable Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was introduced to do his lucky charm act. He trotted on just as Shearer was measuring a 25 yard drive which beat Bosnich low to his left, and - against 10 men - the game was effectively up. </p> <p>That did not prevent Shearer and his public enjoying a second, four minutes from time, but credit for this particular piece of icing on the cake belonged to Helder, who brought the ball elegantly out of defence, and to Didier Domi, whose pinpoint cross from the left wing will probably be the last the England captain sees until after next week's Argentina game.</p>",

The bookmaker who has been paying out early on title bets will also be feeling a trifle concerned, particularly as Roy Keane now faces suspension after being dismissed for two bookable offences. This was only Newcastle's second victory over Manchester United in a dozen attempts, but it was instant success for Robson in a much more emphatic manner than anyone had anticipated. Two second half goals by Alan Shearer gave the home side the margin they deserved, Manchester United could easily have conceded more. Surprisingly this was a first competitive meeting for two of the most respected managers in English football, Newcastle's 5-1 thrashing at Old Trafford last August having been caretaker Steve Clarke's only match in charge. Few would deny Newcastle have bucked up their ideas since then, though until this result they have never quite been able to stop worrying about their proximity to the relegation positions. No such problems for Manchester United, six points clear and in the title driving seat, as Robson conceded before the game. To continue the motoring theme the leaders began like one of David Beckham's fanciest possessions being taken through its paces by an eager salesman. Every one of the visitors' attacking options had been demonstrated to Newcastle within the first 10 minutes, as Manchester United pressed forward in numbers and threatened to overrun their opponents with the slick precision of their passing. Only five minutes had elapsed when Teddy Sheringham anticipated a clever ball from Paul Scholes to shoot a couple of feet too high, then Warren Barton rescued his bewildered defence with a timely interception when Sheringham had two men spare on his left. With Andy Cole particularly impressive, chasing an England recall as well as his 100th Manchester United goal, Beckham put a chance over the bar in the 20th minute and saw a threatening cross cut out by Nikolaos Dabizas at the last moment with two attackers shaping for a tap in. Newcastle's own attacking efforts looked primitive in comparison, with some steady build-ups from the back wasted by careless final balls, and the alleged Duncan Ferguson-Alan Shearer partnership looking almost ungainly. That was until the 27th minute, when Newcastle took the lead and the game turned on a moment which made nonsense of all that had gone before. The home side played a ball up in the direction of their twin strikers, as they had been doing all afternoon, but in this occasion Shearer beat Mickael Silvestre and found Ferguson with a headed flick. The big man had his back to goal and was on the edge of the penalty box, but one graceful swing of his left boot later Mark Bosnich was beaten high to his left and the ball was coming to rest in the Manchester United net. There was a slight pause before the roar arrived, as if the crowd had difficulty registering immediately what had just happened. The same appeared to be true of Manchester United, who did not quite fall to pieces after going behind, but could not have complained had they trailed by two or three at the interval. The lively Kieron Dyer saw a deflected shot strike a post four minutes later, Kevin Gallacher shot too high, and Gary Speed missed an inviting target from the edge of the area with Bosnich stranded. Most of the ground actually cheered for that one, not realising the ball had flashed the wrong side of an upright. Keane picked up his first yellow card for dissent in the 45th minute, and there was still time for Shearer to give Ferguson another good shooting chance, although this time his aim was less deadly. Ferguson was withdrawn just past the hour - just before Manchester United objections that a Cole flick had crossed the line by the time Steve Harper dropped on it led to them losing their heads completely. Keane was at pains to offer a sporting handshake to Harper after the pair collided at speed two minutes later, but could have no real objections when a late tackle from behind on Rob Lee brought a second booking in the 65th minute, and neither did he raise any. Cole, however, gave a passable impersonation of his captain's previous style in chasing Stephen Lodge all over the pitch, and was lucky to escape with only an additional yellow. The Shearer show started shortly afterwards, at exactly the point the normally reliable Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was introduced to do his lucky charm act. He trotted on just as Shearer was measuring a 25 yard drive which beat Bosnich low to his left, and - against 10 men - the game was effectively up. That did not prevent Shearer and his public enjoying a second, four minutes from time, but credit for this particular piece of icing on the cake belonged to Helder, who brought the ball elegantly out of defence, and to Didier Domi, whose pinpoint cross from the left wing will probably be the last the England captain sees until after next week's Argentina game.",

      "byline": "Andy McSmith, chief political correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alun Michael is out walking the hills this weekend, contemplating his political future and perhaps privately regretting that he ever accepted Tony Blair's call to make Wales his political home.</p> <p>There is a lot of sympathy for the fallen First Secretary, whose first political love always seemed to be Westminster. Having sacrificed a job as Home Office Minister after Ron Davies's 'moment of madness' on Clapham Common, Michael was seen as representing Westminster in Wales, not vice-versa.</p> <p>By the end, he stood on a ledge of political support so narrow it took only a slight push to send him down. Yet he seemed blind to how precarious his situation was. Almost to the end, he thought he could survive, either by striking a pact with Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mike German to avert the prospect of a 'no confidence' vote, or by whipping Labour assembly members into line so he could face down the assembly if the other three parties combined against him. Three setbacks in his final 36 hours of office finally destroyed him.</p> <p>Strike one came when Labour assembly members came together for their normal monthly meeting on Tuesday morning. Chief whip Andrew Davies said the crisis in the assembly was growing. The situation was that a successful 'no confidence' vote would force Michael to resign, but leave his Cabinet in office for the few days it took Labour to reinstate Michael or choose a replacement.</p> <p>But Davies warned that the opposition parties were planning to use what Rhodri Morgan called 'the Nagasaki after the Hiroshima' by stripping Cabinet of delegated powers. Moreover, assembly chairman Dafyd Elis Thomas was adamant Michael could come back once after a vote of 'no confidence' but if the assembly ousted him again, that would be the end. In effect, Michael was told that, if he clung on, he would provoke a crisis which would put Wales temporarily back under direct Westminster rule.</p> <p>But Michael did not trust his chief whip to give disinterested advice. Davies had openly supported Morgan against him in the contest for the Labour leadership and he suspected Davies of manipulating the crisis to bring in the leader he wanted. A week earlier, Davies had been loudly berated in the assembly building by Michael's political adviser, Julie Crowley, for alleged disloyalty. Michael listened in silence - obviously believing Crowley was right.</p> <p>Strike two came late that night. Michael presumed that his Liberal Democrat opposite number, Mike German, would be amenable to a deal which could avert the vote of 'no confidence' altogether. He was even prepared to offer the Liberal Democrats two seats in Cabinet, after opposing any coalition government.</p> <p>His overtures had the powerful backing of Tony Blair, who rang the Liberal Democrat, Charles Kennedy, several times pleading for Michael's political life. His last call was on Tuesday evening. Kennedy replied that devolution implies that these crises must be sorted out locally, without London interference.</p> <p>Still Michael did not give. For about three hours on Tuesday night, he waited in an upstairs room in the assembly with Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy and Rhodri Morgan, hoping German would drop in to talk. The door was open.

      "bodyText": "Alun Michael is out walking the hills this weekend, contemplating his political future and perhaps privately regretting that he ever accepted Tony Blair's call to make Wales his political home. There is a lot of sympathy for the fallen First Secretary, whose first political love always seemed to be Westminster. Having sacrificed a job as Home Office Minister after Ron Davies's 'moment of madness' on Clapham Common, Michael was seen as representing Westminster in Wales, not vice-versa. By the end, he stood on a ledge of political support so narrow it took only a slight push to send him down. Yet he seemed blind to how precarious his situation was. Almost to the end, he thought he could survive, either by striking a pact with Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mike German to avert the prospect of a 'no confidence' vote, or by whipping Labour assembly members into line so he could face down the assembly if the other three parties combined against him. Three setbacks in his final 36 hours of office finally destroyed him. Strike one came when Labour assembly members came together for their normal monthly meeting on Tuesday morning. Chief whip Andrew Davies said the crisis in the assembly was growing. The situation was that a successful 'no confidence' vote would force Michael to resign, but leave his Cabinet in office for the few days it took Labour to reinstate Michael or choose a replacement. But Davies warned that the opposition parties were planning to use what Rhodri Morgan called 'the Nagasaki after the Hiroshima' by stripping Cabinet of delegated powers. Moreover, assembly chairman Dafyd Elis Thomas was adamant Michael could come back once after a vote of 'no confidence' but if the assembly ousted him again, that would be the end. In effect, Michael was told that, if he clung on, he would provoke a crisis which would put Wales temporarily back under direct Westminster rule. But Michael did not trust his chief whip to give disinterested advice. Davies had openly supported Morgan against him in the contest for the Labour leadership and he suspected Davies of manipulating the crisis to bring in the leader he wanted. A week earlier, Davies had been loudly berated in the assembly building by Michael's political adviser, Julie Crowley, for alleged disloyalty. Michael listened in silence - obviously believing Crowley was right. Strike two came late that night. Michael presumed that his Liberal Democrat opposite number, Mike German, would be amenable to a deal which could avert the vote of 'no confidence' altogether. He was even prepared to offer the Liberal Democrats two seats in Cabinet, after opposing any coalition government. His overtures had the powerful backing of Tony Blair, who rang the Liberal Democrat, Charles Kennedy, several times pleading for Michael's political life. His last call was on Tuesday evening. Kennedy replied that devolution implies that these crises must be sorted out locally, without London interference. Still Michael did not give. For about three hours on Tuesday night, he waited in an upstairs room in the assembly with Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy and Rhodri Morgan, hoping German would drop in to talk. The door was open. There was a bottle of wine ready. But downstairs the six-strong Liberal Democrat group were so hostile to a deal that they refused even to allow German to go upstairs to say goodnight. In an extraordinary snub, they sent German's adviser, Mike Hines, to tell Michael's adviser that there was no prospect of a deal. The embarrassed Hines found himself drawn into the room to meet the three most important politicians in Wales. 'I said, \"the group's not talking - they're saying enough is enough\".

      "body": "<p>Something depressing happens to restaurants on St Valentine's Day. The usual buzz of people having a great time that is such an essential part of going out to dinner is lost to the deathly drone of whispering couples. Prices often go up, and something takes over even the most cold-hearted of chefs, encouraging them to turn out food contrived into heart shapes - particularly when it comes to desserts. Much better, I think, to stay at home and cook a meal for the one you love. </p> <p>I really don't think we have to get carried away with heart-shaped cake tins and pizza moulds at home, either. A candle on the table will do. A white china dish of coeur \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me would be charming, but anything more runs the risk of looking contrived and, frankly, a bit naff. But this doesn't mean the meal need not be romantic. I have always felt that any meal for a St Valentine's night should be sensual and fragrant - voluptuous, even. </p> <p>Special as this date is, and has been so since the 15th century, I don't think it is an excuse for the cook to show off. I get suspicious when people go to too much trouble. It's as if they are trying to hide something. It is, though, a meal for which we should perhaps go to a little more trouble than usual, otherwise it might seem as if we cannot be bothered. (This is one meal in the year that is something of a minefield.) Going so far as to remember your lover's favourite food is probably a good start. Getting their name right might be another.</p> <p>If it's just sex you're after, simply feed them oysters, something (anything) with lots of chillies, and drink Champagne all the way through. You can't go wrong, at least it always seems to work for me. But if there is more to it than that, then I suggest you think about a meal that is quietly pleasing, rather than something that has such blatantly aphrodisiac overtones.</p> <p>OK, so no meat. This is a meal about love, so how can you kill something for it? Anyone who feels they cannot get through an entire meal without some will just have to content themselves with slipping a slice or two of prosciutto into the antipasto. No fish, because this year St Valentine's Day is on a Monday when all good fish shops are traditionally shut, though, in truth, this practice is somewhat outdated. So it is down to vegetables and fruit and some bolstering starch. Something sounds right about this to me. </p> <p>This should, surely, be a fragrant meal. I want to eat something that is heady with spices but not especially hot, which means using the cooler spices such as coriander and cumin, and herbs such as basil and mint. I think there has to be garlic. If both of you eat it, neither will notice its presence later. </p> <p>I have chosen aubergines as the star ingredient in my Valentine's meal. This, you understand, is purely for its deeply sensual texture and nothing to do with the recipe that appears in Norman Douglas's classic Venus in the Kitchen, long out of print, that promises to enlarge the male organ for the period of one moon. The fact is that the spongy flesh of the aubergine soaks up olive oil to the point where it becomes positively silken. There is no other vegetable I know that does this. It also takes spices rather well. Cream, basil and mint take this vegetable, or fruit as it really is, away from its Middle Eastern origins, but add a certain voluptuousness. </p> <p>This year, I shall make a rhubarb tart, and not just for its appropriate colour. The forced, pretty pink stalks around at the moment are as tempting as any tropical fruit, and they quickly cook to a juicy, almost satin-like texture. Their clean sharpness is welcome after the richness of the aubergines and cream. Those for whom rhubarb holds no passion might like to substitute apples or pears, or perhaps make a St Valentine's Day dinner for someone who does. </p> <p><strong>A light antipasto</strong> <br>As the main course is quite rich, I think a plate of salty ham and ripe fruit will be more welcome here than anything else. </p> <p>4 to 6 thin slices of San Daniele or Parma ham <br>1 ripe papaya<br> a ball of buffalo mozzarella <br>a small handful of baby spinach leaves or watercress <br>olive oil and lemon for dressing the leaves</p> <p>You could offer this on two plates, but I am far more tempted to place it all on one and put it in the centre of the table, for both diners to help themselves. The papaya will need halving, peeling and the seeds removing; like melon, its flavour will be improved by the saltiness of the ham. Slice it thickly into fragile wedges. The mozzarella should be sliced and drizzled with a little olive oil and seasoned with black pepper. Anything other than the simplest olive oil and lemon juice dressing would be too much for the baby spinach leaves, so they just need tossing gently in a little of both and seasoning with a grind or two of salt and black pepper. Put a small pile of leaves on to the plate, a cluster of papaya wedges, the slices of seasoned mozzarella and the ham. </p> <p><strong>Baked aubergines with basil, cream and cumin</strong><br> A silken-textured and fragrant dish, rich with cream and olive oil. The quality of the oil is essential, as so much of it is soaked up by the aubergines, and it is visible too in the finished dish. Don't even think of using anything other than olive oil. I used a fruity, but not particularly expensive Greek oil for this. You will need some rice to soak up the juices. Serves 2 with the rice</p> <p>2 large (but not enormous) aubergines <br>olive oil, a good fruity one <br>2 medium-sized onions <br>1 tsp coriander seed <br>1 tsp cumin seed <br>2 large cloves garlic <br>a small bunch of basil - about 25 large leaves <br>a few sprigs of mint - say 30 leaves</p> <p>Wipe each aubergine, then slice them in half lengthways and then again. Cut each piece into thick chunks. Warm some olive oil in a shallow pan - the amount will depend on how much your aubergines soak up, but you can expect to need at least a breakfast cup full - and let the aubergines soften and colour. What you are after are tender lumps of aubergine lightly golden on their cut sides. Lift the aubergines out with a pair of tongs on to kitchen paper to drain. Don't be tempted to miss this step, otherwise the finished dish will be too oily. </p> <p>Peel and chop the onions and garlic and fry them gently in the aubergine pan, adding more oil if they are sticking. In another, smaller shallow pan, toast the whole spices. Added to the pan over a moderate heat, they will be toasted in seconds. They should barely colour. Tip them in to a coffee or spice grinder and whiz them to powder, or crush them in a mortar with a pestle, then stir into the onions. Tear the herbs up a bit and add them to the cream. Toss the onions and aubergines together, season them with pepper and jumble them into a baking dish. </p> <p>Pour over the cream and herbs and bake in a preheated oven at 180C/gas mark 5 until golden and bubbling. It should be ready in about 30 to 40 minutes. </p> <p><strong>Upside-down rhubarb tart</strong><br> Serves 6</p> <p>for the pastry <br>200g plain flour <br>120g butter, cut into small chunks <br>2 tbsps caster sugar <br>1 egg yolk</p> <p>for the filling <br>1kg rhubarb <br>30g butter <br>3 tbsps of sugar (or more to taste) <br>2 tbsps of sugar to finish</p> <p>Put the flour into a large bowl and rub the butter into it with your fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. If you have a food processor, you can blitz the flour and butter for a few seconds instead. I tend to use the hand method simply because I like the feel of the butter and flour between my fingers. Stir in the sugar and the egg yolk with your hand and bring the dough together to form a firm ball. You won't need any water. Set the pastry aside for a while to rest.</p> <p>Chop the rhubarb into thick pieces and rinse it briefly under running water. Put the 30g of butter into a 23-25cm frying pan, scatter over the 3 tablespoons of sugar and pile in the rhubarb. Warm the pan over a moderate heat, letting the butter and sugar melt and the rhubarb give up some of its juices. Now pour off some of the juice, reserving it for later, then roll or press out the pastry to fit the top of the tart tin and gently press it into place, patching up any tears or holes with bits of spare pastry. </p> <p>Bake in a preheated oven at 200C/gas mark 6 for 35 to 40 minutes until the pastry is pale gold and the rhubarb is bubbling. Let it stand for 20 to 30 minutes, before turning out on to a heatproof dish. Dust the rhubarb with sugar and place under a preheated grill until caramelised. Serve with cream and some of the reserved juices. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week, 250 people crammed into London Business School's 'E-posium', a student-run enterprise fair dedicated to e-commerce. The week before, Cranfield Management School became 'the first in Europe', possibly the world, to make setting up a dot-com firm an integral part of students' MBA studies. </p> <p>After hitting big firms and consultancies, enterprise fever is now sweeping business schools and universities faster than a dose of Hong Kong flu. In the past year, LBS has spawned 10 businesses, some of them Internet-based, from its entrepreneurship courses and related start-up incubator. </p> <p>LBS, where entrepreneurship has just achieved parity with finance and strategy as a discipline in its own right, operates its own investment fund, Sussex Place Investment Management, which can share in the upside of the ventures created. </p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge are likewise in on the act. Oxford is planning its second Venturefest, an enterprise and innovation fair sponsored by heavyweights such as McKinsey and HSBC. Isis Innovation has produced a number of biotech start-ups, and the Said Business School has made new business development a major part of its MBA. </p> <p>Cambridge, New Labour's favourite enterprise model, is basking in applause for having landed an 'international enterprise partnership' with the US's Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set up with government backing of \u00a368 million. </p> <p>No one denies that the pace of development has been dramatically accelerated by Internet frenzy. 'Conventional approaches to research and teaching are too slow for Internet space,' says Gerard Burke, who developed the Cranfield project. 'We needed a new way to derive and disseminate knowledge quickly, and at the same time forge a leadership position.' </p> <p>To get its e-fledglings airborne Cranfield has set up an incubator which will provide access to third-party seed capital as well as other support for MBA entrepreneurs. In return it will take a small stake in their start-ups. </p> <p>Just a fad? The schools accept that today's sky-high Internet valuations may be due an adjustment and that many of their Internet shooting stars will crash to earth - indeed, learning from failure, a small element in traditional courses, is an essential and salutary part of the experience. 'The first thing we impress on students is that an idea isn't the same as an opportunity,' says John Bates, who runs the LBS Foundation for Entrepreneurial Management. </p> <p>But the business schools are unanimous that, under the e-froth, something fundamental is changing. On the demand side, careers offices report that students no longer want to spend their careers working their way up through big corporations. </p> <p>And on the supply side, in business schools as in the economy as a whole, 'there's no question but that the time for entrepreneurship has come,' says Michael Hay, who set up the foundation. </p> <p>Historically, he says, entrepreneurship was the Cinderella of business studies, wrongly confused with the management of small businesses. But as Internet opportunities expand, it is coming into its own. The emphasis can only grow in the future as even large companies are forced to reinvent themselves along more entrepreneurial, Internet-enabled lines. 'Think of it as an underground river that has always been there,' says Hay. 'Now that it's had the strength to burst through to the surface, it won't go underground again.' </p> <p>For business schools, whose courses and products are running into increasing competition from internal company 'universities' and (ironically) the Internet, entrepreneurship is a godsend: it's slippery, it's difficult for companies to research and teach themselves - and it's something that everyone really, really wants. </p> <p>At Warwick Business School's centre for small and medium enterprises, Professor David Storey says that compared with North America, UK entrepreneurship initiatives, although growing, hardly register.

      "bodyText": "Last week, 250 people crammed into London Business School's 'E-posium', a student-run enterprise fair dedicated to e-commerce. The week before, Cranfield Management School became 'the first in Europe', possibly the world, to make setting up a dot-com firm an integral part of students' MBA studies. After hitting big firms and consultancies, enterprise fever is now sweeping business schools and universities faster than a dose of Hong Kong flu. In the past year, LBS has spawned 10 businesses, some of them Internet-based, from its entrepreneurship courses and related start-up incubator. LBS, where entrepreneurship has just achieved parity with finance and strategy as a discipline in its own right, operates its own investment fund, Sussex Place Investment Management, which can share in the upside of the ventures created. Oxford and Cambridge are likewise in on the act. Oxford is planning its second Venturefest, an enterprise and innovation fair sponsored by heavyweights such as McKinsey and HSBC. Isis Innovation has produced a number of biotech start-ups, and the Said Business School has made new business development a major part of its MBA. Cambridge, New Labour's favourite enterprise model, is basking in applause for having landed an 'international enterprise partnership' with the US's Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set up with government backing of \u00a368 million. No one denies that the pace of development has been dramatically accelerated by Internet frenzy. 'Conventional approaches to research and teaching are too slow for Internet space,' says Gerard Burke, who developed the Cranfield project. 'We needed a new way to derive and disseminate knowledge quickly, and at the same time forge a leadership position.' To get its e-fledglings airborne Cranfield has set up an incubator which will provide access to third-party seed capital as well as other support for MBA entrepreneurs. In return it will take a small stake in their start-ups. Just a fad? The schools accept that today's sky-high Internet valuations may be due an adjustment and that many of their Internet shooting stars will crash to earth - indeed, learning from failure, a small element in traditional courses, is an essential and salutary part of the experience. 'The first thing we impress on students is that an idea isn't the same as an opportunity,' says John Bates, who runs the LBS Foundation for Entrepreneurial Management. But the business schools are unanimous that, under the e-froth, something fundamental is changing. On the demand side, careers offices report that students no longer want to spend their careers working their way up through big corporations. And on the supply side, in business schools as in the economy as a whole, 'there's no question but that the time for entrepreneurship has come,' says Michael Hay, who set up the foundation. Historically, he says, entrepreneurship was the Cinderella of business studies, wrongly confused with the management of small businesses. But as Internet opportunities expand, it is coming into its own. The emphasis can only grow in the future as even large companies are forced to reinvent themselves along more entrepreneurial, Internet-enabled lines. 'Think of it as an underground river that has always been there,' says Hay. 'Now that it's had the strength to burst through to the surface, it won't go underground again.' For business schools, whose courses and products are running into increasing competition from internal company 'universities' and (ironically) the Internet, entrepreneurship is a godsend: it's slippery, it's difficult for companies to research and teach themselves - and it's something that everyone really, really wants. At Warwick Business School's centre for small and medium enterprises, Professor David Storey says that compared with North America, UK entrepreneurship initiatives, although growing, hardly register. Almost every developed country in the world is beating a path to the US to see how it's done. But it is still a 'hugely significant thing'. Storey argues - and aggregate figures don't contradict him - that past attempts to improve British management performance by formally training people already in business hasn't worked. 'The evidence that training reduces failure is very weak indeed,' he says. On the other hand, trying to influence people while they are in the education system seems a more promising route. 'It's not a question of trying to convince everyone to set up their own firm - that's bizarre,' he says. 'But everyone should be aware of the entrepreneurial option.' Storey's prognosis is supported by LBS research which suggests that until now UK managers have been slow to spot opportunities. Remedying the entrepreneurship deficit would have a knock-on effect for the whole economy. 'Part of our problem in the past has been that bankers and advisers knew nothing about the entrepreneurial, small-business mindset,' notes Storey. 'But it's fundamentally different from that of large firms. A small firm is no more a big one in miniature than a caterpillar is a scaled-down butterfly.'

      "body": "<p>Over the next few weeks people will eagerly tell you American Beauty has the Best Picture Oscar in the bag. After all, it's hard to think of a film that has ever come out to such a rapturous reception from critics and public alike. It's the screamingly obvious choice. But here's some advice: put your money on The Talented Mr Ripley. </p> <p>You see, Ripley has history on its side. In the Nineties only one film with a wholly contemporary setting won the Best Picture award: that was The Silence Of The Lambs in 1992. But that film broke all the Academy Award conventions so thoroughly - going for terror rather than tears - that it remains the exception that proves the rule. </p> <p>Otherwise the likely Best Picture contenders this year represent a voyage through time that starts with Forrest Gump 's dash through recent US history and goes all the way back to Braveheart, rewinding through World War Two ( The English Patient, Schindler's List ), the Edwardian era ( Titanic ), the West ( Unforgiven, Dances With Wolves ) and Elizabethan England ( Shakespeare In Love ). </p> <p>Last year there wasn't one nominee set in the present: Shakespeare In Love beat Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Life Is Beautiful and Elizabeth. </p> <p>It is possible there are people who really think all the best films of recent times have been period pieces of some kind - but probably only James Ivory and his closest friends. And there are cruel critics who point out that for many members of the self-selecting Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences, World War Two is a contemporary event and the sinking of the Titanic the recent past. </p> <p>But you get closer to the truth by examining the institutional logic of the Academy. The Oscars function as a third way in cinema. Unlike the critics, the Academy is not keen on Martin Scorsese and doesn't look kindly on subtitled films. Unlike the filmgoing public, the members aren't drawn to big explosions, horror movies, Austin Powers or sexually frustrated teenagers. </p> <p>Instead the Academy is the defender of a middlebrow notion of quality. There's a reassurance about costume dramas, a feeling that they will never become dated. You can feel the sheer craft of the production - costumes, sets - in a way you can't with a realistic contemporary film - one of the reasons The English Patient beat Secrets and Lies and Jerry Maguire. </p> <p>History is a McDonald's-free zone. In movies, more often than not, the past looks exquisite. But this year it looks like the pattern will be broken. (Or so we predict.) The picturesque past is likely to be represented solely by The Talented Mr Ripley. The Hurricane does stretch back to the Forties but largely takes place in an early Eighties setting which looks and feels present-day - no clunky Rubik's cube references here - and its story of an African-American abused by the forces of law and order is fiercely relevant. </p> <p>After that we are talking about the acutely present-day America of The Insider and American Beauty, the bizarre but undoubtedly modern Being John Malkovich and the outside choice of The Sixth Sense. </p> <p>If we are right about the nominees, the Academy will have to try to branch out a little. There is, of course, a chance we are calling it wrong, and either The Green Mile - Frank Darabont's sprawling follow-up to The Shawshank Redemption - or The End Of The Affair may sneak on to the nomination list. Both must have looked like Oscar certs in the making, but the wisdom is that their perceived flaws, and the advantages of the films on our shortlist, are just too apparent. </p> <p>So if we are following history, Ripley should have it: it basks in its gorgeous Italian locations, has a soundtrack full of jazz - and the luxury of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett in supporting roles. Anthony Minghella has the pedigree of having already directed a Best Picture (The English Patient). </p> <p>On the surface it looks perfect. But the feeling is that The Talented Mr Ripley is a little too nasty. Whereas The English Patient had the tear-jerking moments that the Academy loves, Ripley has murders that go unpunished, not to mention a creepy gay (anti) hero. </p> <p>And then there is the way the story relies heavily on a notion that Americans would rather not admit: that they, too, have a vicious, distorting class system. </p> <p>In fact, most of the Oscar contenders have an eye on the drawbacks of the land of the free. American Beauty - accurately dubbed Fight Club for grown-ups - takes apart the everyday lies of the American Dream while The Insider explores its institutional corruption. Even Being John Malkovich - a film too original to be 'about' anything - takes the insanity of celebrity-obsessed culture as one of its starting points. </p> <p>This year it looks like the Academy is going to have to pick a film that says something harsh about America - or choose The Sixth Sense.

      "bodyText": "Over the next few weeks people will eagerly tell you American Beauty has the Best Picture Oscar in the bag. After all, it's hard to think of a film that has ever come out to such a rapturous reception from critics and public alike. It's the screamingly obvious choice. But here's some advice: put your money on The Talented Mr Ripley. You see, Ripley has history on its side. In the Nineties only one film with a wholly contemporary setting won the Best Picture award: that was The Silence Of The Lambs in 1992. But that film broke all the Academy Award conventions so thoroughly - going for terror rather than tears - that it remains the exception that proves the rule. Otherwise the likely Best Picture contenders this year represent a voyage through time that starts with Forrest Gump 's dash through recent US history and goes all the way back to Braveheart, rewinding through World War Two ( The English Patient, Schindler's List ), the Edwardian era ( Titanic ), the West ( Unforgiven, Dances With Wolves ) and Elizabethan England ( Shakespeare In Love ). Last year there wasn't one nominee set in the present: Shakespeare In Love beat Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Life Is Beautiful and Elizabeth. It is possible there are people who really think all the best films of recent times have been period pieces of some kind - but probably only James Ivory and his closest friends. And there are cruel critics who point out that for many members of the self-selecting Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences, World War Two is a contemporary event and the sinking of the Titanic the recent past. But you get closer to the truth by examining the institutional logic of the Academy. The Oscars function as a third way in cinema. Unlike the critics, the Academy is not keen on Martin Scorsese and doesn't look kindly on subtitled films. Unlike the filmgoing public, the members aren't drawn to big explosions, horror movies, Austin Powers or sexually frustrated teenagers. Instead the Academy is the defender of a middlebrow notion of quality. There's a reassurance about costume dramas, a feeling that they will never become dated. You can feel the sheer craft of the production - costumes, sets - in a way you can't with a realistic contemporary film - one of the reasons The English Patient beat Secrets and Lies and Jerry Maguire. History is a McDonald's-free zone. In movies, more often than not, the past looks exquisite. But this year it looks like the pattern will be broken. (Or so we predict.) The picturesque past is likely to be represented solely by The Talented Mr Ripley. The Hurricane does stretch back to the Forties but largely takes place in an early Eighties setting which looks and feels present-day - no clunky Rubik's cube references here - and its story of an African-American abused by the forces of law and order is fiercely relevant. After that we are talking about the acutely present-day America of The Insider and American Beauty, the bizarre but undoubtedly modern Being John Malkovich and the outside choice of The Sixth Sense. If we are right about the nominees, the Academy will have to try to branch out a little. There is, of course, a chance we are calling it wrong, and either The Green Mile - Frank Darabont's sprawling follow-up to The Shawshank Redemption - or The End Of The Affair may sneak on to the nomination list. Both must have looked like Oscar certs in the making, but the wisdom is that their perceived flaws, and the advantages of the films on our shortlist, are just too apparent. So if we are following history, Ripley should have it: it basks in its gorgeous Italian locations, has a soundtrack full of jazz - and the luxury of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett in supporting roles. Anthony Minghella has the pedigree of having already directed a Best Picture (The English Patient). On the surface it looks perfect. But the feeling is that The Talented Mr Ripley is a little too nasty. Whereas The English Patient had the tear-jerking moments that the Academy loves, Ripley has murders that go unpunished, not to mention a creepy gay (anti) hero. And then there is the way the story relies heavily on a notion that Americans would rather not admit: that they, too, have a vicious, distorting class system. In fact, most of the Oscar contenders have an eye on the drawbacks of the land of the free. American Beauty - accurately dubbed Fight Club for grown-ups - takes apart the everyday lies of the American Dream while The Insider explores its institutional corruption. Even Being John Malkovich - a film too original to be 'about' anything - takes the insanity of celebrity-obsessed culture as one of its starting points. This year it looks like the Academy is going to have to pick a film that says something harsh about America - or choose The Sixth Sense. And even that film - in the scenes set in the dreary, faded flat that Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette live in - has a mood that harks back to the social realism of the era when Kramer Vs Kramer (1979) and Ordinary People (1980) won Best Picture in successive years. If the Academy can't have distant Scottish warriors or Shakespeare, how about The Hurricane, the story of the struggle to free boxer Rubin Carter from wrongful imprisonment? At least it has a swelling climax, plenty of moments where even cynical audiences will shed tears, and a feelgood ending: all ideal Oscar ingredients. The problem with The Hurricane is that it has been charged with taking just a little too much poetic license. No one is claiming that Carter was guilty all along, but an argument is raging about who was responsible for freeing him, and just how it happened. The Insider, too, has all the drawbacks of a recent true story - too many credible witnesses springing up, claiming the real story was very different. So if we rule out Being John Malkovich as too daring and The Sixth Sense as too crowd pleasing - that brings us back to American Beauty after all. American Beauty is clever, bleak, funny and very much of the moment. All in all, the kind of film that never wins the Best Picture Oscar. This time it just might. But don't write off Ripley: for the Academy, living in the past is a hard habit to break.",

      "body": "<p>When FTSE International meets on 8 March to decide who is in and out, up and down, in the stock market, construction company BICC's lowly \u00a3330 million market capitalisation means it could be demoted to the small-cap index - of the smallest companies in the market. But Baltimore Technologies, a supplier of secure systems for the Internet and now worth \u00a33.4 billion, could be elevated to the FTSE 100 index - of the largest ones. </p> <p>Yet eight years ago, BICC sat squarely in the FTSE 100. Last year its sales totalled more than \u00a33bn, and its profits are likely to have been more than \u00a350m. </p> <p>Baltimore is better known as a city on the east coast of the United States than as a business. This is hardly surprising given that, until last December, the company was in the FTSE Fledgling index of those too tiny even to count as small. Its total sales last year were probably less than \u00a325m and it lost a similar amount. </p> <p>BICC and Baltimore are just two of the more extreme examples of the split that is emerging in the stock market between new and old economies. Any company associated with the new technologies of the Internet and the mobile phone - such as Vodafone, ARM Holdings, or service companies such as FI Group - are in huge demand. What has been attracting less attention, however, is the knock-on effect of this on the constituents of the old economy. </p> <p>Whole swathes of the stock market, including such sectors as retailing, property, engineering, construction and leisure are being largely ignored by investors desperate to put their money into high technology. Companies as disparate as Invensys and Next, British Land and Bass are seeing their ratings plunge to unprecedented lows. </p> <p>The plunge looks as though it is accelerating. Last week alone, companies such as BICC, Mayflower, and BBA lost more than 10 per cent of their value - yet nothing within them had changed. </p> <p>The falls were blamed on Vodafone. Victory in its bid for Mannesmann means that it will now represent 14 per cent of the FTSE100 index, and many institutions found themselves short of shares. To get their weightings up, they had to sell something, and it was old-economy stocks that suffered. </p> <p>But last week's moves were part of a deeper rebalancing of investors' portfolios. They are looking to the future and concluding that the Internet is changing everything. Inflation is disappearing and the web is adding to that pressure. </p> <p>Companies in the old economy can no longer rely on pushing through price increases to drive their profits up. But few of them can bank on volume rises, either: businesses such as chemicals, retailing and much of the rest of manufacturing industry are seeing low growth, or none at all. The only way to keep profits growing is to keep costs falling - hence the spate of mergers among old-economy companies. </p> <p>Companies in the new economy, by contrast, are growing fast. Baltimore may not be making profits - few of the new technology stocks are - but it is expected to almost double its sales this year. The City is banking on that sales growth eventually translating into healthy profit rises. But the change has taken many investors by surprise. Their portfolios are still heavily weighted to the old economy, and they are struggling to increase their exposure to the fashionable sectors. </p> <p>Dresdner Kleinwort Benson calculates that, at the end of September (the latest figures available) British institutions were 10 per cent under weight in both telecommunications services and software and its services. </p> <p>By contrast, they were at least 30 per cent overweight in old-economy sectors such as construction, packaging and cars. Funds without a sufficient weighting in new economy sectors - and that includes almost every institution - are underperforming, and rushing to buy. The greater the rush, the more prices rise and the more stock the institutions need to get their weightings right. </p> <p>David Rough, group director of investments at Legal &amp; General, says it has become irrelevant whether technology stocks will perform well enough to justify their share prices. 'Given how funds have performed over the past two years, you cannot justify not holding these stocks. If your job, your bonus and your performance are measured on how well you are performing, you can't go on saying the emperor has no clothes forever.' </p> <p>And he points out that the performance of some of the engineers had been poor, while many were simply too small to attract much attention. To reverse the declines, they had to do something: such as buy in their shares or merge with rivals. If they survive long enough, that is: recent French bids for Marley and Blue Circle underline how vulnerable the old-economy companies have become. A growing number of commentators think the rise in technology stocks looks like a bubble, and warn that it will burst. That may be bad news for investors who have paid inflated prices to get their hands on technology shares, but it probably means shares in the old economy 'will not fall as fast', said Rough. </p> <p>'Sure there is a bubble,' said Andrew Lapthorne of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 'But it still makes more sense to be invested in the bubble companies than it does in the old-economy stocks.' </p> <p>That may be true for the fund managers: if they continue to avoid technology stocks, they may be out of a job when the bubble bursts. The rest of us, whose pensions and savings are funding the institutions' dash for growth, may be less lucky. We could find ourselves holding the booby prize.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When FTSE International meets on 8 March to decide who is in and out, up and down, in the stock market, construction company BICC's lowly \u00a3330 million market capitalisation means it could be demoted to the small-cap index - of the smallest companies in the market. But Baltimore Technologies, a supplier of secure systems for the Internet and now worth \u00a33.4 billion, could be elevated to the FTSE 100 index - of the largest ones. Yet eight years ago, BICC sat squarely in the FTSE 100. Last year its sales totalled more than \u00a33bn, and its profits are likely to have been more than \u00a350m. Baltimore is better known as a city on the east coast of the United States than as a business. This is hardly surprising given that, until last December, the company was in the FTSE Fledgling index of those too tiny even to count as small. Its total sales last year were probably less than \u00a325m and it lost a similar amount. BICC and Baltimore are just two of the more extreme examples of the split that is emerging in the stock market between new and old economies. Any company associated with the new technologies of the Internet and the mobile phone - such as Vodafone, ARM Holdings, or service companies such as FI Group - are in huge demand. What has been attracting less attention, however, is the knock-on effect of this on the constituents of the old economy. Whole swathes of the stock market, including such sectors as retailing, property, engineering, construction and leisure are being largely ignored by investors desperate to put their money into high technology. Companies as disparate as Invensys and Next, British Land and Bass are seeing their ratings plunge to unprecedented lows. The plunge looks as though it is accelerating. Last week alone, companies such as BICC, Mayflower, and BBA lost more than 10 per cent of their value - yet nothing within them had changed. The falls were blamed on Vodafone. Victory in its bid for Mannesmann means that it will now represent 14 per cent of the FTSE100 index, and many institutions found themselves short of shares. To get their weightings up, they had to sell something, and it was old-economy stocks that suffered. But last week's moves were part of a deeper rebalancing of investors' portfolios. They are looking to the future and concluding that the Internet is changing everything. Inflation is disappearing and the web is adding to that pressure. Companies in the old economy can no longer rely on pushing through price increases to drive their profits up. But few of them can bank on volume rises, either: businesses such as chemicals, retailing and much of the rest of manufacturing industry are seeing low growth, or none at all. The only way to keep profits growing is to keep costs falling - hence the spate of mergers among old-economy companies. Companies in the new economy, by contrast, are growing fast. Baltimore may not be making profits - few of the new technology stocks are - but it is expected to almost double its sales this year. The City is banking on that sales growth eventually translating into healthy profit rises. But the change has taken many investors by surprise. Their portfolios are still heavily weighted to the old economy, and they are struggling to increase their exposure to the fashionable sectors. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson calculates that, at the end of September (the latest figures available) British institutions were 10 per cent under weight in both telecommunications services and software and its services. By contrast, they were at least 30 per cent overweight in old-economy sectors such as construction, packaging and cars. Funds without a sufficient weighting in new economy sectors - and that includes almost every institution - are underperforming, and rushing to buy. The greater the rush, the more prices rise and the more stock the institutions need to get their weightings right. David Rough, group director of investments at Legal &amp; General, says it has become irrelevant whether technology stocks will perform well enough to justify their share prices. 'Given how funds have performed over the past two years, you cannot justify not holding these stocks. If your job, your bonus and your performance are measured on how well you are performing, you can't go on saying the emperor has no clothes forever.' And he points out that the performance of some of the engineers had been poor, while many were simply too small to attract much attention. To reverse the declines, they had to do something: such as buy in their shares or merge with rivals. If they survive long enough, that is: recent French bids for Marley and Blue Circle underline how vulnerable the old-economy companies have become. A growing number of commentators think the rise in technology stocks looks like a bubble, and warn that it will burst. That may be bad news for investors who have paid inflated prices to get their hands on technology shares, but it probably means shares in the old economy 'will not fall as fast', said Rough. 'Sure there is a bubble,' said Andrew Lapthorne of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 'But it still makes more sense to be invested in the bubble companies than it does in the old-economy stocks.' That may be true for the fund managers: if they continue to avoid technology stocks, they may be out of a job when the bubble bursts. The rest of us, whose pensions and savings are funding the institutions' dash for growth, may be less lucky. We could find ourselves holding the booby prize.",

It was in fact written in 1937 for the short-lived magazine Night and Day by my favourite movie critic, Graham Greene, about a British film he admired called Brief Ecstasy, directed by a Frenchman, Edmond Gr\u00e9ville. </p> <p>'The story of the struggle between tenderness and sexual desire,' this melodrama concerned the adulterous affair between a handsome adventurer and the beautiful wife of a kindly, well-off older man who was incapable of satisfying her. </p> <p> Brief Ecstasy anticipates the now much publicised postwar affair that Greene had with Catherine Walston, the young wife of a rich left-wing landowner, which provided Greene with the plot of The End of the Affair, the 1951 novel published long before the affair was over. </p> <p>It is wrong, however, to read the book as autobiographical, though the character of its narrator, the novelist Maurice Bendrix, began a series of painful self-portraits that continued with the journalist Fowler in The Quiet American and the architect Querry in A Burnt-Out Case. </p> <p> The End of the Affair is a curious, very literary novel, cruel, bitterly comic, self-lacerating, a Catholic book written, so Greene's friend Evelyn Waugh claimed, to beguile Protestants by its paradoxes. It was also the first time Greene used a first-person narrator and told his story in a complicated series of flashbacks. Both conventions are observed in the adaptation by his fellow Catholic novelist Neil Jordan, who is consistently true to the book's spirit while making several crucial changes. </p> <p> The End of the Affair begins in 1939 when the critically esteemed, commercially unsuccessful writer Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) meets Sarah (Julianne Moore), the attractive young wife of the mild-mannered senior civil servant Henry Miles (Stephen Rea), whom Bendrix is studying as the subject for a novel. </p> <p>They immediately embark on a passionate love affair, the entirely carnal nature of which Jordan captures in their furtive, unlyrical couplings. The affair ends abruptly in 1944 during an air raid when a flying bomb explodes on Clapham Common in south-west London and Sarah, thinking Bendrix is dead, makes a pact with God to forgo her lover if He will spare his life. </p> <p>Two years later, the embittered, rejected, jealous Bendrix, supposedly acting on the complaisant husband's behalf, and not understanding why he was rejected, hires a private detective to investigate the identity of his rival, only to discover - from a purloined diary - that he is in fact God. </p> <p>Jordan, with his designers and cinematographer, skilfully re-creates that austere corner of Greeneland that is wartime London to which the passports are ration books and Catholic missals. But the Second World War merely serves to frame the action. </p> <p>Although they're both excited by the possibility of imminent death in the form of a German bomb ending their love, Bendrix the agnostic novelist and Sarah his Catholic lover are wholly indifferent to this vast, global conflict in their pursuit of sex and salvation. </p> <p>Jordan (unwisely in my view) turns the childhood accident that makes Bendrix unfit for military service into something more heroic, a wound suffered in the Spanish Civil War, but otherwise The End of the Affair is Casablanca or any other morally-inclined war picture turned on its head. </p> <p>Duty and patriotism don't figure at all in the lovers' thoughts, and only dimly for the decent Henry, whose chief motivation is the progress in his public career from OBE to CBE to KBE, those political baubles Greene despised. </p> <p> The End of the Affair is about the novelist as God, and God as a novelist who gives his characters free will.

      "body": "<p>Last summer's most exclusive wedding? Not Edward and Sophie's; nor Posh and Becks's; and you can forget Zo\u00eb Ball and Norman Cook's shindig at Babington House. The coolest invitation of all - so cool that the tabloids didn't even know about it, let alone gate-crash it - was to celebrate the union of Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze: Hollywood's two newest, sharpest directors. The party was held at her family estate in the Napa Valley; her father, Francis Ford Coppola, served wine from 1971, the year of her birth. 'This is the last of my very best wine,' he announced. 'It's called Sofia.' </p> <p>The guests were as hip as could be: Anna Sui, Marc Jacobs, Kirsty Hume, Donovan Leitch, Tom Waits, Zoe Cassavetes... After the party, the couple left for a honeymoon in Bora Bora, having completed their films, Sofia's The Virgin Suicides and Spike's Being John Malkovich, to critical acclaim. </p> <p>Still, it hasn't always been easy being Sofia Coppola. Ten years ago Sofia was the object of almost universal derision after her father cast her as Al Pacino's daughter in The Godfather Part III. After that public humiliation, she buried herself in her studies, emerged briefly as a model, then kept her head below the parapet for several years with Milk Fed, her own fashion label, a tiny clothes shop in LA and a sideline in photography. </p> <p>But Sofia Coppola was drawn back into the family business when she fell in love with Jeffrey Eugenides's novel, The Virgin Suicides . She turned it into a screenplay and then found herself directing it, with Kathleen Turner and James Woods in starring roles. The film's premiere in Cannes last year received exceptional reviews and, when we met the day after the its screening at the London Film Festival, the response was equally positive. 'People told me they liked it,' she says, so quietly that I have to lean forward to hear her. 'But they were surprised they liked it. I suppose that's inevitable - some people find it hard to separate my history from who I am.' </p> <p>Today she appears to be an extraordinarily ordinary girl: young, skinny, dark, shy, like a sixth-former who's been let off school for the afternoon. I'm beginning to wonder if she really is Sofia Coppola (her husband has an alarming habit of turning up in weird disguises or staging fights in front of journalists). After a while, she seems so effortlessly cool, you can't keep your eyes off her: battered jeans, white Aertex top, tiny diamond stud earrings and sneakers. </p> <p>Like its director, The Virgin Suicides is mysterious, in a gentle sort of way. That, perhaps, is what makes it so beguiling. It doesn't shriek, nor does it offer a pat plot and a conventional finale. 'I like the fact that the story doesn't answer everything,' says Coppola. 'There are things in life that you can't understand.' </p> <p> The Virgin Suicides tells the tale of the Lisbon sisters, five suburban golden girls who kill themselves, observed by a chorus of unnamed neighbourhood boys who, despite their best efforts, remain unable to comprehend the reasons for these deaths. 'I never had a sister,' says Sofia, 'but like anyone who has experienced that kind of loss, that there's no reason for...' Her voice trails away into silence, before she adds: 'You can't spend the rest of your life looking for a reason.' </p> <p>Sofia Coppola's 22-year-old brother, brother, Gian Carlo, died in a boating accident in 1986. His girlfriend was pregnant at the time and their daughter, Sofia's niece, is now 13. Clearly, it's an age that Sofia remembers vividly. 'I found it really frustrating,' she says. 'You look like a little kid, yet in your head you're a grown-up.' </p> <p>Later, Sofia says that she doesn't want people to assume that she only made the film because of the death of her brother. But clearly, Eugenides's novel, with its landscape of inexplicable tragedy and teenage grief that blasts adult lives apart, had a profound effect on her. 'I read it maybe five years ago, just after it came out. It wasn't like I was looking for a movie to make, but I loved the book,' she says, with uncharacteristic emphasis. 'It was like someone understands you, has written it just for you. A year or so later, I heard that somebody else was trying to make a film out of it - a guy who was adding sex and violence - and I thought, \"Oh no, that doesn't sound right,\" so I decided I'd sit down and write a screenplay myself.' </p> <p>She had no experience and no training, other than a lifetime of listening to her father talk about the art of filmmaking. 'I thought about going to film school, but then I realised I learnt more from my dad,' she says. 'It's so contagious, his enthusiasm.' </p> <p>Sofia's screenplay was sufficiently impressive to persuade the producers to hand the project over to her. Interestingly, she has turned what might have been a work of desolation into something more hopeful. 'The Lisbon sisters taught the boys about love - and that's uplifting,' she remarks. 'I didn't want the film to be gruesome, and I didn't want people to leave the cinema feeling sad.' </p> <p>It is tempting to speculate what her father might have felt about the story, having lost his own child in a savage stroke of fate. 'I didn't tell him about it at first,' she says, cautiously. 'I wrote it in secret. And then I gave it to my dad to read, and he was really moved by it.' </p> <p>You can see why appearing in her father's film would have been such a torment; and also why she needs to frame emotions elsewhere, through her own lens. </p> <p>'It is really comforting to see someone expressing something you can relate to,' she says. 'That way, you feel less alone...' </p> <p>We say goodbye, but bump into each other again the following evening at a party. She's there without Spike, looking smaller than ever. Slowly, a group of people gathers around her: glamorous models, famous photographers, film stars. She is at the centre, looking out, watchful, quiet, compelling. No husband at her side; certainly no need for her father's directions... Suddenly, Sofia Coppola looks very powerful indeed. </p> <p>\u0095 Justine Picardie@Vogue/ The Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications Ltd.

A year or so later, I heard that somebody else was trying to make a film out of it - a guy who was adding sex and violence - and I thought, \"Oh no, that doesn't sound right,\" so I decided I'd sit down and write a screenplay myself.' She had no experience and no training, other than a lifetime of listening to her father talk about the art of filmmaking. 'I thought about going to film school, but then I realised I learnt more from my dad,' she says. 'It's so contagious, his enthusiasm.' Sofia's screenplay was sufficiently impressive to persuade the producers to hand the project over to her. Interestingly, she has turned what might have been a work of desolation into something more hopeful. 'The Lisbon sisters taught the boys about love - and that's uplifting,' she remarks. 'I didn't want the film to be gruesome, and I didn't want people to leave the cinema feeling sad.' It is tempting to speculate what her father might have felt about the story, having lost his own child in a savage stroke of fate. 'I didn't tell him about it at first,' she says, cautiously. 'I wrote it in secret. And then I gave it to my dad to read, and he was really moved by it.' You can see why appearing in her father's film would have been such a torment; and also why she needs to frame emotions elsewhere, through her own lens. 'It is really comforting to see someone expressing something you can relate to,' she says. 'That way, you feel less alone...' We say goodbye, but bump into each other again the following evening at a party. She's there without Spike, looking smaller than ever. Slowly, a group of people gathers around her: glamorous models, famous photographers, film stars. She is at the centre, looking out, watchful, quiet, compelling. No husband at her side; certainly no need for her father's directions... Suddenly, Sofia Coppola looks very powerful indeed. \u0095 Justine Picardie@Vogue/ The Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications Ltd.

      "body": "<p>Just after I graduated from university, I was commissioned to write a small play for a local theatre company. The opportunity came on the back of a fledgling excursion into writing when, as a student, I had sufficient hubris to present a musical, which I also directed, acted and sang in. I cringe at the thought of it. </p> <p>Nevertheless, playwright Alan Plater, then chairman of the theatre company, saw enough in my crude efforts to give me the chance to work with professional actors. I duly wrote the play and directed it. My chief memory of the experience was at an early performance on tour in Grimsby, where our audience comprised mainly elderly coach parties. </p> <p>The play began with a bleak monologue in the dark. I thought it extremely dramatic. After a few minutes, the audience felt moved to complain noisily of what they assumed was an electrical failure. Then they proceeded to head for the exit. Alan's programme notes described the play as being in the spirit of Patricia Highsmith. I had never heard of Highsmith, but thought I should find some of her work. The book I stumbled across concerned the exploits of a young American living in Europe called Tom Ripley. </p> <p>Almost 20 years later, Sydney Pollack, another mentor, asked me to adapt The Talented Mr Ripley for his company. At that time, I was marooned in my attempts to make The English Patient and felt - on the basis of my one, specious, and not entirely auspicious connection to the author - that it might be something to consider. </p> <p>In the Ripley novels, of which The Talented Mr Ripley is the first, a person can live or die, sometimes literally, on the strength of their choice of cocktail. Taste is everything. Highsmith rarely describes the physical geography, eschews adjectives, sketches out a moment in impatient and irritable prose. There seems little distance between her own baleful view of the world and that of her protagonist's, who travels through a handful of novels, behaving badly, never caught. </p> <p>You enter into an airless, claustrophobic world with Tom Ripley. Almost no other character is fully alive, and his cool, dislocated perspective lures the reader in, convincing us that what objectively might be heinous makes perfect sense inside Ripley's head. The world, experienced through this skinless sensibility, is an alarming place - Ripley feels so intensely, can be giddy with excitement or despair. He is always an outsider, straining for companionship but destined to be alone. </p> <p>His actions are an extreme response to emotions all of us recognise: the sense that there is a better life being lived by somebody else, somewhere else, someone not trapped inside the hollow existence in which we find ourselves. It's one of the things which makes us human. We've all been Tom Ripley, just as we've all known a Dickie Greenleaf, the man who has everything, whose attention makes us feel special. We've all basked in the sunshine of that attention and felt the chill of losing it. </p> <p>It was this unsettling connection to Ripley and the anxiety that what happens to him is familiar, at least in nightmares, that prompted me to make this film. Not the empathy for a hero, but the queasy recognition that this plausible misfit is not so far from one version of ourselves; not approval but an acknowledgment that this is where we might end up without the reassuringly tight belt of morality around our waists. </p> <p>In adapting the novel to film lay the challenge of exciting the audience to commit to the material as I did as a reader, to inhabit each step of Ripley's journey. Adaptation for film is, by definition, a process of editorialising. The dramatist is obliged to make innumerable decisions - what is the book about? How will it fit into the prescribed length of a movie? How to dramatise the secret thoughts the novelist can describe but the film can only suggest; where to begin; how to end; how to collect the tone of the prose. </p> <p>The answer to these questions must inevitably speak as loudly about the preoccupations of the film-maker as they do about the contingent issues of phrasing the material and organising the story for a film audience. Part of the business of reading is to create an inner cinema on which the events play out. And we can be sure that for each reader the film is different. Adaptation is, finally, sharing one's inner cinema with an audience - this is how it felt to me; this is what I thought I was reading. The dramatist becomes an enthusiastic messenger, bringing news from somewhere else, remembering the best bits, exaggerating the beauty, relishing the mystery, probing the moral imperative, watching for gasps or tears, orchestrating them and, ideally, prompting the captive cinema audience to make the pilgrimage back to the book, which remains blessedly itself. </p> <p>But as Italo Calvino said of storytelling, the tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it. The demands of film are also a release, enabling the writer to emphasise and mute by turns. The screenplay is both an argument with the source material and a commentary on it. The uninflected brilliance of Highsmith's novel, its disavowal of moral consequence, Ripley's solipsism, the author's acerbic judgment of everybody other than Ripley, the book's heavy employment of devices - letters, coincidences - do not sit easily within the context of film. </p> <p>But if the intimate gestures of a novel, its private conversation between writer and reader, are not available to the film-maker, they are exchanged for other, equally powerful, tools. Film grammar, with its unique ability to manipulate images, flexing from the intense close-up to the broadest vistas, is perfectly placed to situate personal behaviour in a public landscape. It can contextualise action, remind us that we are as individuals in thrall quite literally to the bigger picture. </p> <p> 'This was the clean slate he had thought about on the boat crossing over from America. This was the real annihilation of his past and himself, Tom Ripley, who was made up of that past, and his rebirth as a completely new person.' </p> <p> My reading of Ripley's isolation at the end of the novel, however much he fantasises about the freedom his lies and improvisations have earned him, is that it contains an implicit cautionary tale. What the reader knows is that Ripley's clean slate is an illusion. The rebirth is a temporary disguise and, worse, one that condemns the impostor to a constant fear of exposure. </p> <p>To be uncovered as a sham is the very thing which prompts Ripley to sham in the first place. And so the film came to hinge on a central premise - Ripley's credo that it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. It becomes a story about class. The novel is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. And so the film is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. But it departs in one crucial sense by concluding that eluding public accountability is not the same thing as eluding justice. </p> <p>The film has a moral imperative: you can get away with murder, but you don't really get away with anything. Ripley, always looking for love, has to kill his opportunity for love. He ends the movie alone, free, in a hell of his own making. Just as in Dante, where purgatory is some karmic reflection of life - flatterers pitched in manure, adulterers chasing for ever - so in annihilating self, assuming someone's identity, Ripley is condemned never to be free to be truly himself. This tragic dimension provided an architecture for the screenplay. Its ambitions were to maintain the narrative ambivalence of the novel - not telling an audience what to think, not opting for an announced moral closure, but intensifying the consequence of Ripley's actions on the soul. </p> <p>Without the reassuring appearance of a judge, the audience is asked to be a jury. A number of choices stem directly from this strategy. A signal adjustment to the novel is that Ripley does not plan to kill Dickie; quite the reverse. The death scene begins with Ripley revealing the depth of his feelings for Dickie, horribly miscalculated, cruelly rejected. Dickie dies in an eruption of rage and it is his own capacity for violence which exacerbates a reflexive swing of an oar into a do-or-die struggle. It's an accident which provides Ripley with a defining opportunity. </p> <p>And, as so often in this story, it's an opportunity he seizes as much in shame as in calculation. His journey to purgatory begins with the borrowing of a jacket, because he doesn't possess a decent one of his own. It continues, for what he feels are the same reasons, with the borrowing of an identity. </p> <p>Peter Smith-Kingsley, mentioned only in passing in the novel, becomes a fully-fledged character in the film. His acceptance of Ripley suggested itself as a required irony, a way of dramatising what Highsmith called the annihilation of Ripley's past and himself; in killing Peter he murders his own chance of happiness. Peter, the most centred character in the film, also serves as a reminder that Ripley's pathology is not explained by his sexuality. Similarly, Herbert Greenleaf's relationship with Dickie developed into a crucial strand. The film's mechanism of lies and escape depends on a father's lack of faith in his son, a prejudgment that makes him incapable of seeing Ripley's hand in what has happened. In this way, Ripley can appear to be the better version of Dickie, the son Herbert wishes he had. </p> <p>No one in this story sees truth in front of them because of the distortions of their own prejudices and preconceptions. Only Marge Sherwood, in a more substantive role than the novel allows, has a sufficiently uncluttered spirit to both welcome Ripley and then suspect him. But the collusion of men, such a feature of this story and of the times, undermines her. They are too busy covering up, preferring to interpret Marge's unerring radar for the truth as the misguided forensics of heartbreak. </p> <p>Meredith Logue, a new character for the film, gives Ripley the chance to create his own version of Marge, just as he creates his own version of Dickie. Her presence also accentuates that this is principally a story about young people, each of whom has run away from something, making themselves up in the context of a foreign country, partners as Meredith observes giddily, in disguise . The foreign country is Italy. </p> <p>For two generations before Ripley, Americans had been coming to Europe to explore issues of identity and sexuality. It's no accident that Highsmith had settled in Europe in the Fifties and would have been a contemporary of Marge and Meredith. Nor is it an accident that her book is loosely based on The Ambassadors. </p> <p>The idea of the Grand Tour, of exploring the Old Country, of soaking in the culture of Europe, continues to exert an irresistible tug on American travellers long after Europe's culture has been conquered and transformed by America. Italy, a substantial character in this film, its landscape largely intact from the Renaissance paintings which celebrate it, its history as the artistic and classical heart of the Continent, has particular appeal. </p> <p>'Was it, in short, ever well to be elsewhere when one might be in Italy?' wrote Edith Wharton. By locating the movie a year or two later than the novel, there was an opportunity to explore a significant moment in Italian history, where a thin veneer of the modern had glossed but could not hide the primitive mores of the country. </p> <p>Italy is a place I love above all other places, but it's always possible to detect a darker note under its breezy melodies. And this dissonance seemed to speak of the film itself, apparently sybaritic, but lounging on a volcano. Mongibello, the name Highsmith gave to the fictional village on the Amalfi coast where Dickie and Marge are living, is a local name for Vesuvius. </p> <p>Finally, a film called The Talented Mr Ripley had to address Ripley's talents. If Ripley is blessed and cursed by one thing, it is his ability to turn on a sixpence, to reel off the most elaborate and plausible riffs of fantasy. In identifying this, the importance of music grew in my mind, replacing the more literary motif of painting in the novel. Music for period, music for place, music for argument. And so the screenplay also became a kind of libretto, working out relationships in musical terms, pitting Dickie's identification with jazz, its mantra of freedom and existentialism, against Ripley's classicism and asserting that, just as in music, where truly great extemporising begins with Bach and Mozart, so it is Ripley who proves to be the more genuine improviser. </p> <p>When I adapted The English Patient, I was accompanied on an adventure that involved wholesale reimagining of Michael Ondaatje's novel. Patricia Highsmith died as I began writing the first draft of Ripley and before I could meet her. If I were to have pleased anybody with this adaptation, I would have liked it to have been her and I worked with her own pungent words about fiction as a touchstone. She imagined Ripley sitting at the typewriter with her as she wrote her novel. I imagined her sitting with me as I wrote my screenplay. </p> <p> 'If a suspense writer is going to write about murderers and victims, about people in the vortex of this awful whirl of events, he must do more than describe brutality and gore. He should be interested in justice or the absence of it in the world, good and bad, and in human cowardice or courage - but not merely as forces to move his plot in one direction. In a word, his invented people must seem real.' </p> <p>\u0095Taken from The Talented Mr Ripley by Anthony Minghella to be published by Methuen Publishing Limited on 17 February, price \u00a37.99.</p>",

How to dramatise the secret thoughts the novelist can describe but the film can only suggest; where to begin; how to end; how to collect the tone of the prose. The answer to these questions must inevitably speak as loudly about the preoccupations of the film-maker as they do about the contingent issues of phrasing the material and organising the story for a film audience. Part of the business of reading is to create an inner cinema on which the events play out. And we can be sure that for each reader the film is different. Adaptation is, finally, sharing one's inner cinema with an audience - this is how it felt to me; this is what I thought I was reading. The dramatist becomes an enthusiastic messenger, bringing news from somewhere else, remembering the best bits, exaggerating the beauty, relishing the mystery, probing the moral imperative, watching for gasps or tears, orchestrating them and, ideally, prompting the captive cinema audience to make the pilgrimage back to the book, which remains blessedly itself. But as Italo Calvino said of storytelling, the tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it. The demands of film are also a release, enabling the writer to emphasise and mute by turns. The screenplay is both an argument with the source material and a commentary on it. The uninflected brilliance of Highsmith's novel, its disavowal of moral consequence, Ripley's solipsism, the author's acerbic judgment of everybody other than Ripley, the book's heavy employment of devices - letters, coincidences - do not sit easily within the context of film. But if the intimate gestures of a novel, its private conversation between writer and reader, are not available to the film-maker, they are exchanged for other, equally powerful, tools. Film grammar, with its unique ability to manipulate images, flexing from the intense close-up to the broadest vistas, is perfectly placed to situate personal behaviour in a public landscape. It can contextualise action, remind us that we are as individuals in thrall quite literally to the bigger picture. 'This was the clean slate he had thought about on the boat crossing over from America. This was the real annihilation of his past and himself, Tom Ripley, who was made up of that past, and his rebirth as a completely new person.' My reading of Ripley's isolation at the end of the novel, however much he fantasises about the freedom his lies and improvisations have earned him, is that it contains an implicit cautionary tale. What the reader knows is that Ripley's clean slate is an illusion. The rebirth is a temporary disguise and, worse, one that condemns the impostor to a constant fear of exposure. To be uncovered as a sham is the very thing which prompts Ripley to sham in the first place. And so the film came to hinge on a central premise - Ripley's credo that it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. It becomes a story about class. The novel is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. And so the film is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. But it departs in one crucial sense by concluding that eluding public accountability is not the same thing as eluding justice. The film has a moral imperative: you can get away with murder, but you don't really get away with anything. Ripley, always looking for love, has to kill his opportunity for love. He ends the movie alone, free, in a hell of his own making. Just as in Dante, where purgatory is some karmic reflection of life - flatterers pitched in manure, adulterers chasing for ever - so in annihilating self, assuming someone's identity, Ripley is condemned never to be free to be truly himself. This tragic dimension provided an architecture for the screenplay. Its ambitions were to maintain the narrative ambivalence of the novel - not telling an audience what to think, not opting for an announced moral closure, but intensifying the consequence of Ripley's actions on the soul. Without the reassuring appearance of a judge, the audience is asked to be a jury. A number of choices stem directly from this strategy. A signal adjustment to the novel is that Ripley does not plan to kill Dickie; quite the reverse. The death scene begins with Ripley revealing the depth of his feelings for Dickie, horribly miscalculated, cruelly rejected. Dickie dies in an eruption of rage and it is his own capacity for violence which exacerbates a reflexive swing of an oar into a do-or-die struggle. It's an accident which provides Ripley with a defining opportunity. And, as so often in this story, it's an opportunity he seizes as much in shame as in calculation. His journey to purgatory begins with the borrowing of a jacket, because he doesn't possess a decent one of his own. It continues, for what he feels are the same reasons, with the borrowing of an identity. Peter Smith-Kingsley, mentioned only in passing in the novel, becomes a fully-fledged character in the film. His acceptance of Ripley suggested itself as a required irony, a way of dramatising what Highsmith called the annihilation of Ripley's past and himself; in killing Peter he murders his own chance of happiness. Peter, the most centred character in the film, also serves as a reminder that Ripley's pathology is not explained by his sexuality. Similarly, Herbert Greenleaf's relationship with Dickie developed into a crucial strand. The film's mechanism of lies and escape depends on a father's lack of faith in his son, a prejudgment that makes him incapable of seeing Ripley's hand in what has happened. In this way, Ripley can appear to be the better version of Dickie, the son Herbert wishes he had. No one in this story sees truth in front of them because of the distortions of their own prejudices and preconceptions. Only Marge Sherwood, in a more substantive role than the novel allows, has a sufficiently uncluttered spirit to both welcome Ripley and then suspect him. But the collusion of men, such a feature of this story and of the times, undermines her. They are too busy covering up, preferring to interpret Marge's unerring radar for the truth as the misguided forensics of heartbreak. Meredith Logue, a new character for the film, gives Ripley the chance to create his own version of Marge, just as he creates his own version of Dickie. Her presence also accentuates that this is principally a story about young people, each of whom has run away from something, making themselves up in the context of a foreign country, partners as Meredith observes giddily, in disguise . The foreign country is Italy. For two generations before Ripley, Americans had been coming to Europe to explore issues of identity and sexuality. It's no accident that Highsmith had settled in Europe in the Fifties and would have been a contemporary of Marge and Meredith. Nor is it an accident that her book is loosely based on The Ambassadors. The idea of the Grand Tour, of exploring the Old Country, of soaking in the culture of Europe, continues to exert an irresistible tug on American travellers long after Europe's culture has been conquered and transformed by America. Italy, a substantial character in this film, its landscape largely intact from the Renaissance paintings which celebrate it, its history as the artistic and classical heart of the Continent, has particular appeal. 'Was it, in short, ever well to be elsewhere when one might be in Italy?' wrote Edith Wharton. By locating the movie a year or two later than the novel, there was an opportunity to explore a significant moment in Italian history, where a thin veneer of the modern had glossed but could not hide the primitive mores of the country. Italy is a place I love above all other places, but it's always possible to detect a darker note under its breezy melodies. And this dissonance seemed to speak of the film itself, apparently sybaritic, but lounging on a volcano. Mongibello, the name Highsmith gave to the fictional village on the Amalfi coast where Dickie and Marge are living, is a local name for Vesuvius. Finally, a film called The Talented Mr Ripley had to address Ripley's talents. If Ripley is blessed and cursed by one thing, it is his ability to turn on a sixpence, to reel off the most elaborate and plausible riffs of fantasy. In identifying this, the importance of music grew in my mind, replacing the more literary motif of painting in the novel. Music for period, music for place, music for argument. And so the screenplay also became a kind of libretto, working out relationships in musical terms, pitting Dickie's identification with jazz, its mantra of freedom and existentialism, against Ripley's classicism and asserting that, just as in music, where truly great extemporising begins with Bach and Mozart, so it is Ripley who proves to be the more genuine improviser. When I adapted The English Patient, I was accompanied on an adventure that involved wholesale reimagining of Michael Ondaatje's novel. Patricia Highsmith died as I began writing the first draft of Ripley and before I could meet her. If I were to have pleased anybody with this adaptation, I would have liked it to have been her and I worked with her own pungent words about fiction as a touchstone. She imagined Ripley sitting at the typewriter with her as she wrote her novel. I imagined her sitting with me as I wrote my screenplay. 'If a suspense writer is going to write about murderers and victims, about people in the vortex of this awful whirl of events, he must do more than describe brutality and gore. He should be interested in justice or the absence of it in the world, good and bad, and in human cowardice or courage - but not merely as forces to move his plot in one direction. In a word, his invented people must seem real.' \u0095Taken from The Talented Mr Ripley by Anthony Minghella to be published by Methuen Publishing Limited on 17 February, price \u00a37.99.",

She has been doing this for the past eight years as chief executive of Stonewall; and she's winning. </p> <p>It can only be a matter of time now before Section 28 is repealed. And she has just returned from witnessing, in the House, a vote, backed by Michael Portillo, to lower the age of consent for gay sex. The laws are changing, and, more importantly, the mood of the country has changed, apparently irrevocably. We are looking, together, at a Gallup poll in that day's Telegraph which concludes that 'an almost universal tolerance of homosexual relationships now obtains in this country'. It's a conclusion you couldn't have safely forecast when she started at Stonewall, before Beth Jordache's screen kiss, before Queer as Folk . It's a conclusion you couldn't have begun to dream of when she first came out, in 1971. And much of the consciousness-altering has been done by this woman and her colleagues, who have eschewed the more gaudy approach of groups such as OutRage! in favour of quiet, intense political lobbying based on the simple idea of equality. It has, over the past few years, made Stonewall one of the most astoundingly successful lobby groups in Britain in terms of objectives achieved. Which is not bad going for a former anarchist who once stood in the dock of the Old Bailey facing bombing charges. </p> <p>What seems to motivate her most is not anger but remembered sadness, continued worry. It's all to combat the 'fear, and the loneliness' of growing up gay with no one to talk to about it, be it teachers or friends or lovers; feeling always on the outside, ever dislocated, always alone. </p> <p>'I'm of a generation that was completely in the closet,' she says, remembering growing up in the Forties and Fifties in the Isle of Sheppey. 'I thought then, I thought for a long time, that if I was open about - no, if I even acknowledged - my sexuality then that would condemn me to a lonely, miserable, isolated existence.' </p> <p>When did she first realise she was a lesbian? 'I was quite young, actually. I think most people have some sort of dawning sense at least somewhere around puberty and that was certainly the sense for me.' Did she have any relationships? 'No, it was all in my head. I think that was a very typical experience of men and women of my generation.' </p> <p>She couldn't confide in lovers; nor could she confide in friends. 'Absolutely no one. No one at all. Which was terrible, because if I had had someone to go to, it would have been just wonderful. It would have made me happier. It would have made me a better person.' Better in what way? 'Because to have a very important part of yourself just not operating, for a long period of time, does at an important level distort you. You are a less rounded person. I think all lesbians and gay men who come out, particularly those who come out later in life, have to go through what is almost a process of healing.' </p> <p>Confusion continued until she was married, to scriptwriter William Randolph Mason, in 1971. 'Like many lesbian women I'd had boyfriends. And I had one particularly close boyfriend, and I was completely torn at the time about whether, you know, I could make it with him, we could make it together, or whether I ought to be out and open. It all sort of happened very quickly, all happened together.' </p> <p>Around the same time, she was becoming increasingly involved in anarchist and feminist politics at the London School of Economics - accused at one stage, and acquitted, of being part of an Angry Brigade bombing campaign - and she had begun seeing Elizabeth Wilson, active in the Gay Lib movement. The timing was all wrong, but she came out anyway. She and Elizabeth are still together, and live with Angela's daughter by artificial insemination, who is now 15. Her daughter, she adds, gallantly anticipating the faintly crass question I'm about to ask, has a boyfriend. </p> <p>How did her husband take it ? 'It was quite difficult.' Her dark little eyes slide away from mine. 'He was understanding. In a way. Actually, it was his friends who took it badly. They thought you can't do that. You can't be like that. I think they thought I was doing it to be wilful or something. So, it was a hard time, but still coming out was wonderful . Absolutely wonderful.' </p> <p>As, she says, is the mood today. 'The tolerance is a great thing, and I think it's still shifting in the right direction. Particularly among young people, there's been a shift in ethical values: they don't derive their moral values from the establishment any more - the church, or Westminster, or whatever - but have a sense of individual morality. There's also a growing tolerance among the parental generation, because that's getting younger all the time, of course. It's all a big generational issue.' </p> <p>The country may be mainly on her side, then, but did she know who her enemies were? 'My main worry is the linkings with some Christian groups. Baroness Jay's campaign against us last year was actually very well organised, and partly because of the links with these groups. And I do worry that might bring, in the future, increasing fundamentalism, of an American kind. This could happen. You see, it's like with politics today: it's much more difficult for a leader like Hague to lead a \"broad church\" because his congregation is increasingly narrow. And the same process taking place in the actual churches.' </p> <p>What, I wonder, about the enemy within? About Peter Tatchell and other more militant campaigners, and the potential negative publicity, particularly the demand this week that 'since recreational sex is a natural activity and a popular pursuit, all laws which seek to control it should be abolished.' She peers at the newspaper, grimacing quietly. </p> <p>'I think this is not helpful. I am not campaigning for recreational sex. I am campaigning for equality. There needs to be some public sex offence which protects people from nuisance. You need to protect the public.' </p> <p>She has talked, non-stop, for a long time, but she pauses, for a long while, when I ask my last question: how did she think her life would have worked out had she not come out? 'I would have had some kind of nervous breakdown.' She knows, because she gets the calls, still, every day, from some of the thousands of Angela Masons in this country who stayed in.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is no better place to see the scale and immaturity of <a href=\"'http://www.amazon.co.uk'\" target_new>Amazon.co.uk</a> than at its new distribution centre, Marston Gate, a warehouse with a solid, pedestrian design a world away from its voguish website. A 30-minute taxi ride from Milton Keynes train station, it is one of three grey monoliths on a building site just off Junction 13 of the M1. The warehouse is vast - about 250,000 sq ft - and has yet to be filled with items from the old warehouse in Slough. Next door, the JCBs are busy constructing another Amazon.co.uk warehouse twice the size. The current warehouse, however, still lacks a canteen. </p> <p>In many ways Marston Gate reflects the global operation, Amazon.com. Like the company, it is expanding so fast it can't keep up. Behind the sleek website and hype of e-commerce, there is a drab factory floor of a business, that needs to do such dull things as stack and post books, and even turn profits. Here, the seamlessness of the virtual world comes adrift. </p> <p>Last week the knives were out for Amazon, after the company was forced to admit a huge rise in losses and 150 redundancies at its distribution arm in the United States. If a company announces redundancies for 2 per cent of its workers, and has achieved a 543 per cent annual rise in its losses over the last quarter, one can be excused for thinking there's a problem. </p> <p>But Amazon is at the forefront of the school of e-commerce thinking that says that the more you're spending on marketing and developing your company - as opposed to declaring a profit - the better position you are engineering for yourself in the market. Last week it happily announced losses of $323 million; investors cheered and celebrated; the stock rose from $69.44 to as high as $79 in after-hours trading. But when the redundancies were (reluctantly) announced, the stock fell to $60. </p> <p>Few found the Internet madness of the first rise - or the slump that followed the redundancies - surprising. Amazon's history - the soaring stock, the relentless losses - epitomises the story of e-commerce. The redundancies were to many the result of its trebling its stateside staff during the expansion of the past year, and, quite simply, doing a bit of housekeeping - growing up, so to speak. </p> <p>The current Amazon line, delivered with a taciturn confidence, is that the redundancies were part of an 'ongoing process of organisational review', and that we shouldn't draw any conclusions until the review is over. They'd diversified into selling DVDs, pharmaceuticals and DIY, and were now consolidating. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Amazon declared that it had finally broken into profit in book sales, despite the fact that books accounted for less than half of its sales in the last financial quarter. US books revenue has risen by 66 per cent in the past year; and net sales have increased by 169 per cent to $1.64 billion. </p> <p>Nevertheless, ran the rumours, if Amazon is sacking people, it has clearly miscalculated, and is struggling to make a flawed business model work. Such was the scope of Amazon's diversification that its ambition may well have overreached itself. Rob Zegelaar, director of venture capitalist Atlas, is among those who believe Amazon's frantic diversification may have been a little unwise: 'It's not as knowledgeable about the new segments as it is about books. It will face fierce competition in these new areas.' </p> <p>Last week, Amazon chose to raise money by selling debts denominated in euros, giving investors greater security and securing a cash fund for the years ahead - one it will doubtless need. </p> <p>Amazon is already having to tackle the might of Bertelsmann's online bookstore, <a href=\"'http://www.bol.com'\" target_new>bol.com</a>, and the associated m-commerce (mobile-based) competition that its merger with Vodafone will bring. But by undercutting its competitors on price, Amazon has retained an impressive market share. This served to strengthen its brand and made it the Net's first household name. </p> <p>However, it is unlikely that Amazon's prices will remain artificially low: the company has to adjust to a long-term presence in the consumer market. 'Its margins were under pressure from day one,' says Zegelaar. He thinks investors are growing tired of consumer-oriented e-commerce, because it involves too many small transactions and high marketing costs. 'Amazon are suffering from this,' he says. 'The new interest is in business-to-business ventures.' Marketing costs are lower because the service has a smaller client base and a higher yield. </p> <p>So Amazon may have to change its working model. As Zegelaar suggests, it may have to split into several smaller, more focused companies (one for each product type, perhaps).

      "bodyText": "There is no better place to see the scale and immaturity of Amazon.co.uk than at its new distribution centre, Marston Gate, a warehouse with a solid, pedestrian design a world away from its voguish website. A 30-minute taxi ride from Milton Keynes train station, it is one of three grey monoliths on a building site just off Junction 13 of the M1. The warehouse is vast - about 250,000 sq ft - and has yet to be filled with items from the old warehouse in Slough. Next door, the JCBs are busy constructing another Amazon.co.uk warehouse twice the size. The current warehouse, however, still lacks a canteen. In many ways Marston Gate reflects the global operation, Amazon.com. Like the company, it is expanding so fast it can't keep up. Behind the sleek website and hype of e-commerce, there is a drab factory floor of a business, that needs to do such dull things as stack and post books, and even turn profits. Here, the seamlessness of the virtual world comes adrift. Last week the knives were out for Amazon, after the company was forced to admit a huge rise in losses and 150 redundancies at its distribution arm in the United States. If a company announces redundancies for 2 per cent of its workers, and has achieved a 543 per cent annual rise in its losses over the last quarter, one can be excused for thinking there's a problem. But Amazon is at the forefront of the school of e-commerce thinking that says that the more you're spending on marketing and developing your company - as opposed to declaring a profit - the better position you are engineering for yourself in the market. Last week it happily announced losses of $323 million; investors cheered and celebrated; the stock rose from $69.44 to as high as $79 in after-hours trading. But when the redundancies were (reluctantly) announced, the stock fell to $60. Few found the Internet madness of the first rise - or the slump that followed the redundancies - surprising. Amazon's history - the soaring stock, the relentless losses - epitomises the story of e-commerce. The redundancies were to many the result of its trebling its stateside staff during the expansion of the past year, and, quite simply, doing a bit of housekeeping - growing up, so to speak. The current Amazon line, delivered with a taciturn confidence, is that the redundancies were part of an 'ongoing process of organisational review', and that we shouldn't draw any conclusions until the review is over. They'd diversified into selling DVDs, pharmaceuticals and DIY, and were now consolidating. Meanwhile, Amazon declared that it had finally broken into profit in book sales, despite the fact that books accounted for less than half of its sales in the last financial quarter. US books revenue has risen by 66 per cent in the past year; and net sales have increased by 169 per cent to $1.64 billion. Nevertheless, ran the rumours, if Amazon is sacking people, it has clearly miscalculated, and is struggling to make a flawed business model work. Such was the scope of Amazon's diversification that its ambition may well have overreached itself. Rob Zegelaar, director of venture capitalist Atlas, is among those who believe Amazon's frantic diversification may have been a little unwise: 'It's not as knowledgeable about the new segments as it is about books. It will face fierce competition in these new areas.' Last week, Amazon chose to raise money by selling debts denominated in euros, giving investors greater security and securing a cash fund for the years ahead - one it will doubtless need. Amazon is already having to tackle the might of Bertelsmann's online bookstore, bol.com, and the associated m-commerce (mobile-based) competition that its merger with Vodafone will bring. But by undercutting its competitors on price, Amazon has retained an impressive market share. This served to strengthen its brand and made it the Net's first household name. However, it is unlikely that Amazon's prices will remain artificially low: the company has to adjust to a long-term presence in the consumer market. 'Its margins were under pressure from day one,' says Zegelaar. He thinks investors are growing tired of consumer-oriented e-commerce, because it involves too many small transactions and high marketing costs. 'Amazon are suffering from this,' he says. 'The new interest is in business-to-business ventures.' Marketing costs are lower because the service has a smaller client base and a higher yield. So Amazon may have to change its working model. As Zegelaar suggests, it may have to split into several smaller, more focused companies (one for each product type, perhaps). These would be able to devote themselves exclusively to securing their own markets. It is as unlikely that the Amazon we see in two years' time will resemble the obsessively expanding hybrid of today, as it is that the company will be the 'Atari of the Internet age' - a dinosaur soon to be swept away by the next wave of leaner, e-commerce ideas. The brand and its market position are too strong. Dot.com companies repeatedly emphasise that that profits are not a burning issue at this stage because money is constantly reinvested. Nevertheless, Brent Hoberman of lastminute.com does regard Amazon's breaking into profit within book sales, as important: 'It's a vindication of e-commerce. They've done it; they've proved it; they've taken market share from the established players. They are pulverising Barnes and Noble in that field.' It is important for both him and Amazon that e-commerce shows itself capable of turning a profits, if only to silence the growing crowd of sceptics.

      "body": "<p>The first crocuses are appearing in the orchard, breaking ground with their splayed tips of leaf sheathed in a milky tourniquet. But, unlike daffodils or tulips, the leaves hardly mean anything. Other than this first wispy presence, crocuses seem to rise from the ground as nothing but flower. I think that this is what makes them an annual miracle, as opposed to the seasonal ritual of daffodils and snowdrops. </p> <p>We planted our crocuses this autumn (late, as ever), by lifting turves and placing them, like woody marbles, on the ground before covering them back over with the turf. You order a thousand crocuses as an attempt at big-impact gardening - make a statement, bold grouping and all that - and they arrive in a bag about the size of a kilo of sugar. A thousand crocuses are a mere dapple. You can lose a thousand in a corner of a small garden. </p> <p>I think a mass of crocuses in grass in March sunshine is one of the most memorable floral high points of the year. And, like snowdrops and daffodils, crocuses create a direct and meaningful connection between the back garden and the landscape at large, even via a window box or a pot on a windowsill. In fact, crocuses grow very well in pots, and look particularly good planted cheek by jowl in a shallow, terracotta pan. It is worth buying the species crocuses for containers, rather than the much brasher Dutch cultivars, because they are subtle and delicate, and deserve close inspection.</p> <p>Crocus laevigatus is usually the first to appear and will certainly have done so by the time you read this, pushing up lilac or white flowers in any mild period from Christmas onwards. Crocuses are too far from the nose to be thought of as scented - they do enough without that bonus, but these smell lovely. </p> <p>C tommasinianus is likely to come next, the lavender flowers flopping open in the sunshine. This has two great advantages for the ordinary garden: unlike most crocuses, it will grow well in dappled shade (in other words, in the lee of a deciduous tree or shrub, but not under an evergreen hedge) and it also seeds itself everywhere. I can't think of anything nicer than crocuses popping up unbidden all over my garden. You can get cultivars that vary from the streaked lilac of the species, such as C tommasinianus f albus, which is white, as is 'Eric Smith', or a good purple, such as 'Ruby Giant' (not ruby at all, but a reddish purple).</p> <p>C chrysanthus and C biflorus (the two are very closely related) will be hard on their heels, with the many cultivars that have been made by crossing them. Inevitably, these hybrids are vigorous and big, which, given the essential smallness and delicacy of a crocus, need not be a bad thing. C 'EA Bowles' has a good lemon yellow and, having just seen a picture of it, I am tempted to add it to our spring garden for next year. And I like the idea of 'Zwanenburg Bronze', which is described as 'yellow inside and a rich bronze brown outside'. </p> <p>This, of course, is exactly the right kind of time to choose your crocuses for next year. Read about them now, hunt out examples of the ones you like the sound of in a garden (and this is where places such as Wisley or Kew act as invaluable references) and see it in the flesh, and then place an order in early summer. Not the instant hit of garden-centre shopping, but the best way to do it. Snowdrops and aconites are an exception to this rule, and are best bought 'in the green', which is while they are still flowering. But not crocuses.</p> <p>C vernus is the one you are likely to come across in parks and large gardens, bejewelling great swathes of grass. There is a particularly spectacular planting at Kew. C vernus has provided the stock for most of the named varieties of the big, satiny crocuses, looking almost like stunted tulips in some form of purple, white or yellow. Most of these have been bred by the Dutch, who long ago cornered the bulb market. I visited a bulb warehouse outside Amsterdam once and was staggered at the scale of the operation. Dozens of forklift drivers wearing hairnets, shifting pallets of bulbs, which arrived by the lorry-load from local farms.</p> <p>With so much yellow and orange about in spring, the eye craves the balance of some blue. There are a hundred variations on purple and lilac, but no crocus is really blue, especially when put against the blue of scilla or muscari. But C baytopiorum comes close. I have not grown it, but from photographs it appears to be a very pale turquoise, with darker veins which create a bluish effect.</p> <p>C sativus has always had enormous commercial significance as the source of saffron. As most people know, the spice - or in medieval times, the drug - is made from the dried stigmas of the flower, with over 4,000 flowers needed to produce one ounce of saffron. There is a fascinating connection between saffron and the only naturalised crocuses in Britain - the spring-flowering C vernus ('The Nottingham Crocus') and autumn-flowering C nudiflorus ('The Halifax Crocus'). These are to be found growing wild around Nottingham, the north Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and if their sites are plotted on a map, they are shown to be all along the routes and tracks between Benedictine monastries and their outlying farms. The Benedictines came from Cluny in France, where C nudiflorus grows wild. They were keen and sophisticated gardeners, and may well have attempted to grow the crocus as a substitute for its close relative C sativus, in order to try and make saffron from it. </p> <p>Other sites, which seem to have no clear geographical connection, turn out to have belonged to the Knights Hospitallers or the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, who would have brought the corms back with them from the crusades. Presumably, these too, were part of a deliberate attempt to introduce the corms to create a supply of saffron or saffron-substitute. Unlike most other crocuses, it spreads by underground runners, which potentially makes it viable for the enormous harvest needed to give you any chance of creating a supply of saffron. The manner in which these crusader crocuses spread so widely is a perfect example of how to treat crocuses in grass in the garden. The Trent meadows in Nottingham, where the C vernus are spread like a million spatters of paint, are Lammas land. This means that they were used primarily for hay and not allowed to be grazed between the beginning of February and midsummer. In that time, the crocus leaves appeared, the flowers bloom and set seed, and the leaves slowly fed the new corms before dying back, the whole process unchallenged by the tightly nibbling teeth of sheep or the crushing hooves of cattle. The ground was grazed hard over winter so that the spring crocuses grew in short grass, visible and unswamped.</p> <p>So, plant your crocuses by lifting turf, spreading the corms out before covering them over again, give the grass a late-autumn cut and clear the clippings and then don't cut again until midsummer. That way your dapple will become a smother. </p> <p><strong>Your roots: How to make the most of your crocuses</strong></p> <p>As ever with plants, the closer you can make their growing conditions to their original habitat, the happier they will be, and many crocuses comes from Greece and the hot, thin soils of that part of the Mediterranean. They belong to the Iridaceae, or iris, family, which includes, as well as irises and crocuses, gladioli, montbretias and freesias. Give them good drainage and plenty of sunshine and they will not worry too much about the quality of the soil.</p> <p>Crocuses are not bulbs but corms, which is in reality just a short stem stuffed like a hamster cheek with sustenance. Inside the corm, the flower is fully formed and the food supply is principally used to develop the roots and leaves and is completely consumed by the process of flowering.</p> <p>The new leaves then store next year's food in another corm, which develops on top of the old one. This is why, as any fool knows, you never cut back the leaves of any corm or bulb until it is dying back on its own steam. The new corm has roots that contract and pull it down to the depth of the previous, now thoroughly squashed one. It dries out over the summer and starts developing new roots sometime in the autumn. The best time to plant spring bulbs is at the end of summer, to give these new roots maximum time to get established.</p> <p> <strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I keep a garden diary, not for your consumption, but for mine. It is incredibly useful to me. The records are brief and often insufficient, but never inaccurate. So I can go back to 13 February 1998 and read, 'Exquisite morning, big full moon in blue sky, thrush singing. Snowdrops, hellebores and crocus perfect. Planted two 'Doyen du Comice' pears and onion sets of 75 x turbo, 75 centurion F1, 75 Stuttgart giant and 50 'Sturon'. Sarah potted nine regale lilies and did bonfire. Best Feb weather ever. HOT! 17C.' </p> <p>Funnily enough I have no recollection of the day. Without my diary it would have been lost. And why only 50 of 'Sturon' when there were 75 of the others? Then last year, 13 February went like this: 'Grey damp day. Very raw. Twenty-two hazel bundles delivered, eight more to come. Visited Bryansground and Usk Castle. Both v good. Venison for dinner with chard, red cabbage and apple, roast potatoes, damson sauce. V good.' I am beginning to sound like Parson Woodeford. </p> <p>The truth is, I remember a year ago clearly. We had American visitors checking the garden out for a photo shoot and it looked as bleak and unappealing as it possibly could do. Dead.</p> <p>On 13 February 1989, writing about our previous garden, I read that 'the wind has streamed the branches off the trees all day, rattling the glass in the windows like false teeth. I have done nothing all day. I realised in the middle of last night that the paths in the kitchen garden are far too deeply dug out. The earth from the beds will be constantly spilling on to the finished paths. I can't think why I didn't work this out before. Too pleased with myself. Shit.' I was harder on myself in those days. I am more forgiving now. I also typed everything then, clacking away in the dark, hoping not to wake the children.</p> <p>I miss the punchy solidity of my typewriter, but am irretrievably tied to the computer. The garden diary, however, is now always written with a fountain pen. If I write at the end of a day's gardening, I can scarcely hold the pen with my lumpen fingers, let alone shape words clearly. But it does encourage brevity.</p> <p>The point is, that this is all gardening. The garden runs through our lives like a river through a field, like air in our lungs. The garden does not end in space any more than it does in time. Gardening does not stop or start in the garden. The flowers grow as much in our minds as in the soil. There are very few nights when I do not lie in the dark, with everyone sleeping inside this creaking, bony house, and go through the garden, seeing it with the clarity of a dreamer, taking it to pieces and putting it together again, mending everything in my head.</p>",

This means that they were used primarily for hay and not allowed to be grazed between the beginning of February and midsummer. In that time, the crocus leaves appeared, the flowers bloom and set seed, and the leaves slowly fed the new corms before dying back, the whole process unchallenged by the tightly nibbling teeth of sheep or the crushing hooves of cattle. The ground was grazed hard over winter so that the spring crocuses grew in short grass, visible and unswamped. So, plant your crocuses by lifting turf, spreading the corms out before covering them over again, give the grass a late-autumn cut and clear the clippings and then don't cut again until midsummer. That way your dapple will become a smother. Your roots: How to make the most of your crocuses As ever with plants, the closer you can make their growing conditions to their original habitat, the happier they will be, and many crocuses comes from Greece and the hot, thin soils of that part of the Mediterranean. They belong to the Iridaceae, or iris, family, which includes, as well as irises and crocuses, gladioli, montbretias and freesias. Give them good drainage and plenty of sunshine and they will not worry too much about the quality of the soil. Crocuses are not bulbs but corms, which is in reality just a short stem stuffed like a hamster cheek with sustenance. Inside the corm, the flower is fully formed and the food supply is principally used to develop the roots and leaves and is completely consumed by the process of flowering. The new leaves then store next year's food in another corm, which develops on top of the old one. This is why, as any fool knows, you never cut back the leaves of any corm or bulb until it is dying back on its own steam. The new corm has roots that contract and pull it down to the depth of the previous, now thoroughly squashed one. It dries out over the summer and starts developing new roots sometime in the autumn. The best time to plant spring bulbs is at the end of summer, to give these new roots maximum time to get established. My roots: A week in Monty's garden I keep a garden diary, not for your consumption, but for mine. It is incredibly useful to me. The records are brief and often insufficient, but never inaccurate. So I can go back to 13 February 1998 and read, 'Exquisite morning, big full moon in blue sky, thrush singing. Snowdrops, hellebores and crocus perfect. Planted two 'Doyen du Comice' pears and onion sets of 75 x turbo, 75 centurion F1, 75 Stuttgart giant and 50 'Sturon'. Sarah potted nine regale lilies and did bonfire. Best Feb weather ever. HOT! 17C.' Funnily enough I have no recollection of the day. Without my diary it would have been lost. And why only 50 of 'Sturon' when there were 75 of the others? Then last year, 13 February went like this: 'Grey damp day. Very raw. Twenty-two hazel bundles delivered, eight more to come. Visited Bryansground and Usk Castle. Both v good. Venison for dinner with chard, red cabbage and apple, roast potatoes, damson sauce. V good.' I am beginning to sound like Parson Woodeford. The truth is, I remember a year ago clearly. We had American visitors checking the garden out for a photo shoot and it looked as bleak and unappealing as it possibly could do. Dead. On 13 February 1989, writing about our previous garden, I read that 'the wind has streamed the branches off the trees all day, rattling the glass in the windows like false teeth. I have done nothing all day. I realised in the middle of last night that the paths in the kitchen garden are far too deeply dug out. The earth from the beds will be constantly spilling on to the finished paths. I can't think why I didn't work this out before. Too pleased with myself. Shit.' I was harder on myself in those days. I am more forgiving now. I also typed everything then, clacking away in the dark, hoping not to wake the children. I miss the punchy solidity of my typewriter, but am irretrievably tied to the computer. The garden diary, however, is now always written with a fountain pen. If I write at the end of a day's gardening, I can scarcely hold the pen with my lumpen fingers, let alone shape words clearly. But it does encourage brevity. The point is, that this is all gardening. The garden runs through our lives like a river through a field, like air in our lungs. The garden does not end in space any more than it does in time. Gardening does not stop or start in the garden. The flowers grow as much in our minds as in the soil. There are very few nights when I do not lie in the dark, with everyone sleeping inside this creaking, bony house, and go through the garden, seeing it with the clarity of a dreamer, taking it to pieces and putting it together again, mending everything in my head.",

      "body": "<p>Size matters when it comes to winning Oscars. Academy Award voters favour epic cinema above everything else. That's why it's surprising that director Michael Mann, one of this year's front-runners in the Best Picture and Director categories, hasn't been nominated before. </p> <p>Among contemporary American directors, few have his flair for grandeur. Films like The Last of the Mohicans and Heat combined the scale of David Lean with, occasionally, the intimacy of an Ingmar Bergman film. He says: 'That's what gets me going. I like the larger scale. I like to see human drama played out when the stakes are big.' </p> <p>His latest film, The Insider , provides another opportunity to see Mann at work. Beaten by American Beauty at the recent Golden Globe Awards, the film got some of the best reviews of last year and, equally important in the eyes of the Academy's earnest voters, it has a big message. If American Beauty is the early Oscar favourite, The Insider is currently running a close second. Based on a true story, the film tells the intriguing tale of how Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a TV producer on America's foremost current affairs show 60 Minutes , persuaded Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former tobacco company scientist, to reveal the industry's dirty tricks on air in 1995. It was a spectacular coup until network CBS, fearing a huge lawsuit, pulled the incendiary interview. </p> <p>The result is an excellent whistle-blower thriller in the mould of previous Oscar-feted films, All The President's Men and The China Syndrome, a nicely-paced, meticulous expos\u00e9 of the Establishment. But Mann, who first heard about the case from his friend Bergman, was attracted to the project for its more intimate qualities. 'What really struck me was the opportunity to bring audiences into the raw experience of what happens to a protagonist like Jeffrey Wigand. He finds himself in conflict with a large Fortune 500 corporation and realises they're out to ruin his life. That's more powerful than a typical melodrama.' </p> <p>Mann was particularly struck by Wigand's complex character. 'I was also attracted to this piece because here is a guy who has behaved very courageously, but he's not a saint. He's deeply human with mixed motivations, and that allowed me to access him emotionally in a strong way because he was flawed.' </p> <p>Mann speaks in a distinctive, nasal New York accent. As his reputation suggests, the director is a no-nonsense operator. At the start he shakes hands briskly before beating me to the draw with his own dictaphone. He inserts a fresh tape, presses the record button and says quietly: 'The Observer.' </p> <p>Despite the film's subject matter, which requires a fair amount of exposition, and the fact that much of the two-and-a-half hours running time takes place in offices and over phone lines, Mann has created a fascinating visual accompaniment to the talking heads. The news gathering process has never looked so alluring. During one pivotal phone conversation with Bergman, the beleaguered Wigand sits in a soulless Louisville hotel room. The producer is on holiday and attempts to reassure Wigand via mobile phone, while walking knee deep in the sea under an expressionist, bright blue Bahamas sky. </p> <p>'The phone calls are liberating because you can put two people in different places and create juxtapositions which keep you emotionally involved in what's going on,' says Mann. 'I think audiences are dead intelligent, not just cognitively, and they can take in everything in the frame.' </p> <p>But don't call him a great visual stylist. The man who created the vivid Eighties cop show Miami Vice and showed characters' inner tension through interior design in Heat, bristles at the suggestion. 'Style is for commercials,' he insists. </p> <p>But there are Mann trademarks that characterise much of his cinema and television work: modern interiors, imposing cityscapes, stately camera movement and an interest in crime and punishment. Mann disagrees again. 'The only common factor is that the same person is behind the camera. I'm not consciously aware of doing it. Each film is its own adventure.' </p> <p>Surprisingly, the director showed little interest in cinema until near the end of his studies at the University of Wisconsin in the mid-Sixties. Then the literature student planned to do a PhD and become an academic. 'It felt wrong,' he says now. 'Even when I tried to convince myself to do it. It felt too passive. I tried writing and I was terrible.' </p> <p>Instead he wandered into a film history class. 'I thought someone was going to give me three credits for going to the movies. I was there like a shot.' A few months later Mann had discovered his vocation and won a place at the London International Film School. </p> <p>He began his career as a documentary maker, but by the late Seventies, and after a few tips from a screenwriter pal, he was writing episodes of Starsky and Hutch. In 1981 he made his first feature, The Thief, a slick thriller starring James Caan about an expert crook fighting to retain his independence. It was followed in 1983 by the incoherent supernatural thriller, The Keep - the blot on his CV. </p> <p>In this period he also made two well-received TV movies, The Jericho Mile and LA Takeover, which was eventually remade as Heat. LA Takeover took 19 days to film whereas the climactic bank shoot-out in Heat took 12 days on its own. Mann was eager to stop working in television and advance his movie career. When his agent passed him the outline for what would become Miami Vice he nearly turned it down. </p> <p>The show was a revelation when it was first aired in 1984. The cop show boasted sharp camera angles, a hip rock soundtrack and a carefully co-ordinated, predominately pastel colour scheme. It was new style of drama and became an instant hit. Mann is modest about one of the decade's defining series. ' Miami Vice looked so good because the rest of the stuff on air at the time was shows - like The Dukes of Hazzard - which were pretty antique. Its success was more down to the fact that everything else was so far behind contemporary culture and all we were was current.' </p> <p>Mann was single-handedly responsible for the Miami Vice look. He scoured DIY shops to find the right pastel shades and as a staunch rock fan regulated the show's frenetic score. His reputation for meticulous attention to detail continued with Manhunter (1986) and its chilling aesthetic. The film that introduced moviegoers to Hannibal Lecter, then played by Brian Cox, was a disturbing and gripping thriller about the hunt for a serial killer led by a detective blessed with unusual powers of empathy. </p> <p>In the last 10 years Mann has emerged as one of America's leading directors, equally adept at manipulating the camera or actors, despite releasing just two films. He waited six years after Manhunter before producing The Last of the Mohicans, a captivating eighteenth century romantic adventure starring one the decade's best matched screen couples, Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe. </p> <p>It was shot on location in South Carolina and the arduous filming schedule enhanced Mann's reputation as a combative personality, even among directors. He ran his crew like a drill sergeant. 'I expect everyone to be as aggressive and adventurous as me or they should go to work for someone else,' he says bluntly. </p> <p>On The Last of the Mohicans everyone mucked in. 'When we were climbing a mountain I had a camera case on my shoulder and so did Daniel Day-Lewis. We were climbing at twilight to spend half the night on that mountain shooting a scene. So, yeah, I take what I do dead seriously.' </p> <p>The film was shunned unfairly when the Oscar nominations were announced for 1992. Probably a greater injustice occurred in 1996 when his superb, sprawling cops and robbers movie, Heat - bringing together Al Pacino and Robert de Niro for the first time - was also passed over in the major categories. </p> <p>Given his hardly prolific output - only four films in the last 15 years - it may be some time before Mann gets another chance at picking up a gold statuette. Rumours circulate that he is set to adapt Steven Pressfield's novel Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae , about a battle in 480 BC when 300 Spartan warriors held off a 50,000-strong Persian army. But don't think about booking tickets - Mann has yet to make up his mind. </p> <p>He sighs: 'It's frustrating for me that I'm not more prolific. I would like to be in pre-production next month. I love making films. But finding something I want to shoot is a struggle. A project really has to engage me. It's gotta be of a certain quality. It's gotta be ambitious and it's gotta be something I haven't done before. So I'll probably spend another year in agony.' </p> <p>\u0095 The Insider opens 10 March</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain is becoming a more federal country, and hurrah for that. Alun Michael's dramatic resignation last week or the Scottish revolt on Section 28 sweeping south - even if it leads to a defeat liberal Britain deplores - are both signs that the national politics centred on Westminster is breaking down.</p> <p>The stale order built around a state whose formal power centre remains the Westminster-based crown, is crumbling, with consequences no one can predict. But in a country where better-educated, better-off individuals are more keenly aware of their rights than ever and less willing to accept decisions handed down from above, every chance for the system opening up can only be welcomed.</p> <p>New Labour's attitude to all this is profoundly ambiguous, an ambiguity for which there is a growing political price. Tony Blair could only secure his coup in capturing the Labour Party if he paid a proper debt to John Smith's legacy and that meant devolution for Scotland, and because Wales could not be neglected, a measure of devolution for the principality. But Mr Blair did not want to own up to being a constitutional radical; he gave up as little power as he could so that both parliaments remain in thrall to London, and he refused to locate this tremulous move to a more federal political structure within any overarching move to revitalise British democracy.</p> <p>Instead, he portrayed devolution as a cosmetic adjustment and bent party rules to make sure that his own men - Donald Dewar in Scotland, Michael in Wales and Frank Dobson in London - were in place to administer the quarrelsome provinces under ideological control from London; imperial viceroys rather than independent voices.</p> <p>As a result, he could, in true Third-Way style, tell the British Right that there was no threat to the Union because, as he once famously acknowledged, the Scottish Parliament was little more than a glorified local authority while stressing to the Left that, whatever its reservations, Scotland and Wales now had institutions called parliaments with a modicum of political power, and London was about to acquire a mayor. But this looking two ways at once has earned him the sobriquet simultaneously of being a control-freak, a loyalist to constitutional minimalism and menace to the Union, while gaining little political credit for what by any standard is an important constitutional innovation. Third-Way politics has the advantage of being all things to all men, and works well when there is little political flak. In harder political weather, it is exposed as having no ideological anchorage, no firm allies and no principled compass to inform political action.</p> <p>Thus, last week, the steer from Downing Street was that the control freak had learned his lessons. Mr Blair is said to be relaxed at last week's events in Wales, and whatever his former opposition to Rhodri Morgan as Wales's First Minister, he will live with what happened. He thinks that Scottish politics is richer for its parliament. And if he had his time again, the deep briefings continue, he would not try so openly to fix London's Labour vote for Frank Dobson.</p> <p>Indeed, the idea of the electoral college, in which party members' single votes count for only a third of the total vote beside other (fixable) thirds from unions and MPs and MEPs, is for review. One member, one vote is the way Labour's candidates for high office should be selected in future.</p> <p>It's a welcome change of tack, but the political rewards are small, largely because both the party and public believe the conversion has been forced upon New Labour by political exigency. The new political reality is that the party's reputation for central control is so detested that any local intervention is counter-productive. There is a new 'curse of Blair' that has done for Michael, is weakening Dewar and has imperilled Dobson. A tactical retreat is a political imperative.</p> <p>The difficulty is that the urge to control is now hard wired into the quick of New Labour's being; that the party leadership are control-freaks has become part of the accepted wisdom, largely because it is true. The Blairites do not trust the Labour Party; they fear its instincts for social justice, redistribution of income and dislike of capitalism could resurface and imperil the Blairite project. Worse, as they see it, there is an all-powerful media with scant respect for accuracy and which descends on any form of open debate with the blood lust of vultures. The party has to be run tightly with minimal dissent otherwise it will be cracked open by the media as Major's Tories were.</p> <p>Anybody who dares to challenge this view is asked to reflect on last week's political coverage; there were precious few voices congratulating the Welsh political institutions for coming of age and revitalising Welsh democracy. Rather, there was delight that the Blair bandwagon had come off the rails and vicious pleasure in the hazards of trying to open up British democracy.</p> <p>The Blairites may damn the media for its disdain for honest reporting and lack of accountability (accusations that are not wholly wide off the mark) but their current political predicament is largely their own making. They never sold devolution as it should have been. Indeed, the Blair administration must be the world's least convinced constitutional reformers, whose instincts are to recoil from democracy and qualify liberty - even as they launch the most substantive constitutional reform programme since women won the vote .</p> <p>Freedom of information is offered on niggardly terms. The preferred 'new' House of Lords is one that is wholly appointed. And so on. If Blair had dared, he could have argued that Britain's entire political system and language of political debate needed wholesale redemocratisation. He could have presented his individual reforms as part of a principled package in which the consistent thread was the widening of democracy. Having surrendered the power, he could have distanced himself from the choices London, Scotland and Wales made. He could have urged the press to be fairer with a clean pair of hands. And he could now be on the offensive - and more adequately representing the spirit of our more democratic times.</p> <p>But he is not. Reform minimalism is combined with a cynical approach to the presentation of wider policy that it is polluting the integrity of government and compromising what it is doing. This week, the Trade and Industry Select Committee will damn the DTI for its 'regrettable habit' of dressing up old policies as new and systematically misleading the public; the Education Select Committee has said the same about David Blunkett's famous \u00a319 billion spending which is not \u00a319bn at all. The public's expectations are falsely raised; the gap between what is supposedly and actually happening grows wider.</p> <p>What is urgently required is not the appearance of action and the simulation of principle, so allowing retreat from any initiative if it seems to be running into trouble, but the real thing. A government with a reputation for courage and principle could have ridden last week's reverses with ease. Instead, the Government looked weak over events that were comparatively trivial and which, paradoxically, symbolised a political vitality that its own reforms aimed to create. It is not a happy portent for more testing events.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain is becoming a more federal country, and hurrah for that. Alun Michael's dramatic resignation last week or the Scottish revolt on Section 28 sweeping south - even if it leads to a defeat liberal Britain deplores - are both signs that the national politics centred on Westminster is breaking down. The stale order built around a state whose formal power centre remains the Westminster-based crown, is crumbling, with consequences no one can predict. But in a country where better-educated, better-off individuals are more keenly aware of their rights than ever and less willing to accept decisions handed down from above, every chance for the system opening up can only be welcomed. New Labour's attitude to all this is profoundly ambiguous, an ambiguity for which there is a growing political price. Tony Blair could only secure his coup in capturing the Labour Party if he paid a proper debt to John Smith's legacy and that meant devolution for Scotland, and because Wales could not be neglected, a measure of devolution for the principality. But Mr Blair did not want to own up to being a constitutional radical; he gave up as little power as he could so that both parliaments remain in thrall to London, and he refused to locate this tremulous move to a more federal political structure within any overarching move to revitalise British democracy. Instead, he portrayed devolution as a cosmetic adjustment and bent party rules to make sure that his own men - Donald Dewar in Scotland, Michael in Wales and Frank Dobson in London - were in place to administer the quarrelsome provinces under ideological control from London; imperial viceroys rather than independent voices. As a result, he could, in true Third-Way style, tell the British Right that there was no threat to the Union because, as he once famously acknowledged, the Scottish Parliament was little more than a glorified local authority while stressing to the Left that, whatever its reservations, Scotland and Wales now had institutions called parliaments with a modicum of political power, and London was about to acquire a mayor. But this looking two ways at once has earned him the sobriquet simultaneously of being a control-freak, a loyalist to constitutional minimalism and menace to the Union, while gaining little political credit for what by any standard is an important constitutional innovation. Third-Way politics has the advantage of being all things to all men, and works well when there is little political flak. In harder political weather, it is exposed as having no ideological anchorage, no firm allies and no principled compass to inform political action. Thus, last week, the steer from Downing Street was that the control freak had learned his lessons. Mr Blair is said to be relaxed at last week's events in Wales, and whatever his former opposition to Rhodri Morgan as Wales's First Minister, he will live with what happened. He thinks that Scottish politics is richer for its parliament. And if he had his time again, the deep briefings continue, he would not try so openly to fix London's Labour vote for Frank Dobson. Indeed, the idea of the electoral college, in which party members' single votes count for only a third of the total vote beside other (fixable) thirds from unions and MPs and MEPs, is for review. One member, one vote is the way Labour's candidates for high office should be selected in future. It's a welcome change of tack, but the political rewards are small, largely because both the party and public believe the conversion has been forced upon New Labour by political exigency. The new political reality is that the party's reputation for central control is so detested that any local intervention is counter-productive. There is a new 'curse of Blair' that has done for Michael, is weakening Dewar and has imperilled Dobson. A tactical retreat is a political imperative. The difficulty is that the urge to control is now hard wired into the quick of New Labour's being; that the party leadership are control-freaks has become part of the accepted wisdom, largely because it is true. The Blairites do not trust the Labour Party; they fear its instincts for social justice, redistribution of income and dislike of capitalism could resurface and imperil the Blairite project. Worse, as they see it, there is an all-powerful media with scant respect for accuracy and which descends on any form of open debate with the blood lust of vultures. The party has to be run tightly with minimal dissent otherwise it will be cracked open by the media as Major's Tories were. Anybody who dares to challenge this view is asked to reflect on last week's political coverage; there were precious few voices congratulating the Welsh political institutions for coming of age and revitalising Welsh democracy. Rather, there was delight that the Blair bandwagon had come off the rails and vicious pleasure in the hazards of trying to open up British democracy. The Blairites may damn the media for its disdain for honest reporting and lack of accountability (accusations that are not wholly wide off the mark) but their current political predicament is largely their own making. They never sold devolution as it should have been. Indeed, the Blair administration must be the world's least convinced constitutional reformers, whose instincts are to recoil from democracy and qualify liberty - even as they launch the most substantive constitutional reform programme since women won the vote . Freedom of information is offered on niggardly terms. The preferred 'new' House of Lords is one that is wholly appointed. And so on. If Blair had dared, he could have argued that Britain's entire political system and language of political debate needed wholesale redemocratisation. He could have presented his individual reforms as part of a principled package in which the consistent thread was the widening of democracy. Having surrendered the power, he could have distanced himself from the choices London, Scotland and Wales made. He could have urged the press to be fairer with a clean pair of hands. And he could now be on the offensive - and more adequately representing the spirit of our more democratic times. But he is not. Reform minimalism is combined with a cynical approach to the presentation of wider policy that it is polluting the integrity of government and compromising what it is doing. This week, the Trade and Industry Select Committee will damn the DTI for its 'regrettable habit' of dressing up old policies as new and systematically misleading the public; the Education Select Committee has said the same about David Blunkett's famous \u00a319 billion spending which is not \u00a319bn at all. The public's expectations are falsely raised; the gap between what is supposedly and actually happening grows wider. What is urgently required is not the appearance of action and the simulation of principle, so allowing retreat from any initiative if it seems to be running into trouble, but the real thing. A government with a reputation for courage and principle could have ridden last week's reverses with ease. Instead, the Government looked weak over events that were comparatively trivial and which, paradoxically, symbolised a political vitality that its own reforms aimed to create. It is not a happy portent for more testing events.",

      "byline": "Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Dally died on 25 August 1994. He was 35, gay, and had found out that he was HIV positive in 1986. In the summer months before his death, as his life tapered away, his family and friends collected at his bedside in Islington, north London, to administer watermelon and diamorphine. This was a grim, often abrasive reunion, a last gathering of the clan before John's final departure. Now his sister Emma Dally, a novelist and publisher, has written a memoir of John's illness - which indirectly describes the suicide of their eldest brother several years before - called Dying Twice. </p> <p>The death memoir was the cultural and publishing sensation of the past decade. Think of the voices from the brink: Oscar Moore, Jean Dominique-Bauby, Ruth Picardie and John Diamond. Dally's book, like John Bayley's account of the decline of his late wife Iris Murdoch, is a commentary from the sidelines, and perhaps critics - and this genre has plenty of those - will say that as a mere sibling, her experience is somehow less valid than his. Dally does not care. Like her book, she is direct, unapologetic and disconcerting. 'I thought it was essential to write about death in a very down-to-earth way... I get so sick of all the euphemisms.' </p> <p>She turns 46 tomorrow, and has already been to the funerals of two of her brothers. She does not see why she should be delicate about this, why she should apologise for writing about it. 'When I sold the book, I got a bigger advance for it than I had for my novels,' she says, with a brusque satisfaction that is, inevitably, shocking. 'My editor says it's extraordinary how death has become a kind of trendy subject. A few years ago, no one would have touched it, but now everyone's interested.' </p> <p>How does that make her feel? </p> <p>'That I'm on the cutting edge,' she fires back. 'Commercial trends reflect cultural changes, don't they, reflect what people are thinking. I've no problem with that.' </p> <p>At the beginning, there were six Dally children: Simon, Mark, Emma, Jane, John and Adam. Their father, Peter, was a psychiatrist; their mother, Ann, a doctor and medical journalist. The children were raised in London and at the family bolthole, a house in Sussex called Wiblings. Emma was five when John was born. Two years later, Adam came along. 'I still despised dolls because I did not need them,' she writes. 'I had real babies to dress and bathe and play with. I loved to give them their bottles, swing them casually on my hip the way I had seen the housekeeper and my mother do it, and push the pram down the road as though I was a mother myself... Babies dominated the household, and I loved them.' </p> <p>Emma, the little mother, did well at school, went to Oxford and then followed her eldest brother Simon into publishing. John's dyslexia foxed the system, and he left school without A-levels before setting up a courier company with Adam. At 24 he was driving a silver Mercedes, sending back his food at Le Gavroche, and being hailed as the quintessential Eighties entrepreneur in the press. When he told his family he was gay, it was no big deal, but since this was the early Eighties, and the papers were beginning to report on a new disease that afflicted gay men, Emma was relieved when he settled down with the fashion designer Jacques Azagury. </p> <p>Then Simon, their oldest brother, became ill. In 1988, he was diagnosed with manic depression. He stole some antiquarian books from a private collection and was arrested. A few weeks before the court case, he joined the rest of the family at Wiblings where, on Easter Sunday, he lay down on the front lawn and shot himself. His body was found by Emma and her husband, the food writer Richard Ehrlich, when they and their daughters returned from a walk. The date and place were not random, fuddled choices, says Emma. Like her father, she thinks Simon's death, there in the garden, 'was in a way a criticism of the family for not helping him. Family meant so much to him, but he hadn't been helped. That was typical Simon.' </p> <p>After Simon's death, during the grieving, there were arguments over money. John and Adam's courier business was in trouble, and there was a legal wrangle over Simon's estate; it also transpired that they had persuaded their mother to put up Wiblings as collateral. An 'operatic' row was brewing. By the time the news spread about John's HIV status, the siblings were split down the middle, and Mark and Jane were not speaking to their younger brothers. 'Someone asked me whether my family was particularly dysfunctional,' says Emma, 'and I don't think it is in the slightest. It's just very large, full of people who say what they think.' </p> <p>This is not a book about family grief: the Dally parents, now divorced and both based in the country, are in many ways striking in their absence. It's a story about brothers and sisters and a handful of friends behaving well and very badly in awful circumstances (falling out for imperceptible or enormous reasons, and scrabbling to make it up in time) while John, charming, naive and utterly impractical, sinks deeper into the disease.</p> <p>In her book, Emma recounts all of this without bothering to clamber on to the higher ground. If some of the participants, including John, sometimes come across as careless, greedy or insensitive, she comes across as priggish and stubborn. In that way, it's a strangely dispassionate narrative, and more authoritative for it. 'I just knew that if I was going to do it right, I had to be frank about it all. In a sense I had this set view of how people should behave around someone who's dying which was just as bad as anything else. There isn't actually a set plan of how to react. Some people think they grieve more than others - but people grieve in very different ways.' </p> <p>Though John's circle will never be the same after his death, most of his friends have maintained links with the Dallys. The exception is Jacques Azagury. Despite the fact that their relationship had ended by then, Jacques spent the last months with John and the family, but severed links after the funeral and another row concerning finances. While Emma was putting the book together, he rebuffed her attempts to communicate with him. 'I don't think there's any unresolved business,' says Emma briskly. 'No, and I don't feel that he wants to be friends. He didn't feel the warmth for me that I felt for him, that was obvious in the end, and that was very sad. But there's nothing to make up. We couldn't be friends. It was a horrible way for things to end.' </p> <p>So who has Emma written the book for? Partly for people with terminal diseases, especially gay Aids sufferers ('This Section 28 thing drives me bonkers. All these church people talking about homosexuals as though they're a different breed. It's unbelievable') and their families. Partly for herself ('Writ ing helps you work out what you think and feel about things. Until I did it, things were in a great big muddle'). But mostly for John ('Simon had two nice obituaries, and Johnny didn't'). </p> <p>The book was her mother's idea. If the suggestion hadn't been made, Emma is not sure whether she would have thought of it. She's not expecting an easy ride, but she doesn't give the impression of being particularly anxious about the reception, either from critics or family members. Writing about death, she says, one is guaranteed to offend. 'People get very upset about it. Who are they to say whether you can write something or not? But that's the wonderful thing about taboos. They get people worked up, so they lose sight of everything.' </p> <p>She talks combatively, as if looking forward to a scrap. 'There is this funny thing when people die, about who owns the information. And I have to keep reminding myself that I'm entitled to have my perception of this, and to write about it. And even if people get angry and say, \"It wasn't like that\" - well, it wasn't like that for them, but this is my view.\" If you grow up as one of six siblings, even if you end up losing two of them, you learn how to fight your corner.' </p> <p>\u0095 Dying Twice: A Sister's Tale is published by Little, Brown at \u00a316.99</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Dally died on 25 August 1994. He was 35, gay, and had found out that he was HIV positive in 1986. In the summer months before his death, as his life tapered away, his family and friends collected at his bedside in Islington, north London, to administer watermelon and diamorphine. This was a grim, often abrasive reunion, a last gathering of the clan before John's final departure. Now his sister Emma Dally, a novelist and publisher, has written a memoir of John's illness - which indirectly describes the suicide of their eldest brother several years before - called Dying Twice. The death memoir was the cultural and publishing sensation of the past decade. Think of the voices from the brink: Oscar Moore, Jean Dominique-Bauby, Ruth Picardie and John Diamond. Dally's book, like John Bayley's account of the decline of his late wife Iris Murdoch, is a commentary from the sidelines, and perhaps critics - and this genre has plenty of those - will say that as a mere sibling, her experience is somehow less valid than his. Dally does not care. Like her book, she is direct, unapologetic and disconcerting. 'I thought it was essential to write about death in a very down-to-earth way... I get so sick of all the euphemisms.' She turns 46 tomorrow, and has already been to the funerals of two of her brothers. She does not see why she should be delicate about this, why she should apologise for writing about it. 'When I sold the book, I got a bigger advance for it than I had for my novels,' she says, with a brusque satisfaction that is, inevitably, shocking. 'My editor says it's extraordinary how death has become a kind of trendy subject. A few years ago, no one would have touched it, but now everyone's interested.' How does that make her feel? 'That I'm on the cutting edge,' she fires back. 'Commercial trends reflect cultural changes, don't they, reflect what people are thinking. I've no problem with that.' At the beginning, there were six Dally children: Simon, Mark, Emma, Jane, John and Adam. Their father, Peter, was a psychiatrist; their mother, Ann, a doctor and medical journalist. The children were raised in London and at the family bolthole, a house in Sussex called Wiblings. Emma was five when John was born. Two years later, Adam came along. 'I still despised dolls because I did not need them,' she writes. 'I had real babies to dress and bathe and play with. I loved to give them their bottles, swing them casually on my hip the way I had seen the housekeeper and my mother do it, and push the pram down the road as though I was a mother myself... Babies dominated the household, and I loved them.' Emma, the little mother, did well at school, went to Oxford and then followed her eldest brother Simon into publishing. John's dyslexia foxed the system, and he left school without A-levels before setting up a courier company with Adam. At 24 he was driving a silver Mercedes, sending back his food at Le Gavroche, and being hailed as the quintessential Eighties entrepreneur in the press. When he told his family he was gay, it was no big deal, but since this was the early Eighties, and the papers were beginning to report on a new disease that afflicted gay men, Emma was relieved when he settled down with the fashion designer Jacques Azagury. Then Simon, their oldest brother, became ill. In 1988, he was diagnosed with manic depression. He stole some antiquarian books from a private collection and was arrested. A few weeks before the court case, he joined the rest of the family at Wiblings where, on Easter Sunday, he lay down on the front lawn and shot himself. His body was found by Emma and her husband, the food writer Richard Ehrlich, when they and their daughters returned from a walk. The date and place were not random, fuddled choices, says Emma. Like her father, she thinks Simon's death, there in the garden, 'was in a way a criticism of the family for not helping him. Family meant so much to him, but he hadn't been helped. That was typical Simon.' After Simon's death, during the grieving, there were arguments over money. John and Adam's courier business was in trouble, and there was a legal wrangle over Simon's estate; it also transpired that they had persuaded their mother to put up Wiblings as collateral. An 'operatic' row was brewing. By the time the news spread about John's HIV status, the siblings were split down the middle, and Mark and Jane were not speaking to their younger brothers. 'Someone asked me whether my family was particularly dysfunctional,' says Emma, 'and I don't think it is in the slightest. It's just very large, full of people who say what they think.' This is not a book about family grief: the Dally parents, now divorced and both based in the country, are in many ways striking in their absence. It's a story about brothers and sisters and a handful of friends behaving well and very badly in awful circumstances (falling out for imperceptible or enormous reasons, and scrabbling to make it up in time) while John, charming, naive and utterly impractical, sinks deeper into the disease. In her book, Emma recounts all of this without bothering to clamber on to the higher ground. If some of the participants, including John, sometimes come across as careless, greedy or insensitive, she comes across as priggish and stubborn. In that way, it's a strangely dispassionate narrative, and more authoritative for it. 'I just knew that if I was going to do it right, I had to be frank about it all. In a sense I had this set view of how people should behave around someone who's dying which was just as bad as anything else. There isn't actually a set plan of how to react. Some people think they grieve more than others - but people grieve in very different ways.' Though John's circle will never be the same after his death, most of his friends have maintained links with the Dallys. The exception is Jacques Azagury. Despite the fact that their relationship had ended by then, Jacques spent the last months with John and the family, but severed links after the funeral and another row concerning finances. While Emma was putting the book together, he rebuffed her attempts to communicate with him. 'I don't think there's any unresolved business,' says Emma briskly. 'No, and I don't feel that he wants to be friends. He didn't feel the warmth for me that I felt for him, that was obvious in the end, and that was very sad. But there's nothing to make up. We couldn't be friends. It was a horrible way for things to end.' So who has Emma written the book for? Partly for people with terminal diseases, especially gay Aids sufferers ('This Section 28 thing drives me bonkers. All these church people talking about homosexuals as though they're a different breed. It's unbelievable') and their families.

      "body": "<p>I had misgivings about going back. I'd always imagined returning on a summer's day, driving a convertible BMW, roof down, shades on... instead, it's winter, it's wet and I arrive by train. I leave Hackney Downs station and head straight for Downs Park. It's a Sunday afternoon and I'm hoping to find some of my old crew playing football. The local teams are pouring on to the pitches. Then it happens. I'm recognised and surrounded. I experience the panic of the tourist who strays off the beaten path. I feel like I don't belong. </p> <p>They question me frantically. 'Where have you been?' 'What's happened in the last 10 years?' I fire back my own questions, inquiring after so and so. 'Six feet under', 'banged up' and 'cracked out' come the replies. But before I can pursue any of their stories the whistle sounds and the game begins. I'm abandoned without so much as a 'see you later'. Standing on the touchline, the sole spectator, I marvel at all the wasted talent on show. Eventually I slip away unnoticed. </p> <p>Many of these same guys were with me at Hackney Downs comprehensive in the early Eighties. It was a riotous time. Literally. I remember the morning I walked in late, smoking a spliff. It was the first time I'd attended social studies in three weeks. 'What do you think you're doing, Stephen?' said Mr Wilson. 'Put that thing out right now.' </p> <p>'Fuck you, Wilson.' </p> <p>'Right, Stephen, that's it. Would you kindly leave?' </p> <p>'Nah,' I replied. </p> <p>Tension filled the classroom. I sat at my desk, next to Big Man. We gave each other five and chuckled to ourselves. I gave Big Man the spliff and he sucked on it twice and mashed it under his foot. Wilson marched over to my desk: 'Get out!' </p> <p>'Make me,' I said. </p> <p>He grabbed me by the neck and tried to drag me from my chair. It kicked off. Big Man was on him and in a flash we had him on the floor and were pounding him with kicks and punches. He was a strong man but no match for a couple of strapping 13-year-olds. To protect his vitals, he curled himself up like a foetus, but that didn't stop us laying into him. We only came to our senses when we noticed the claret dripping from his smashed nose. </p> <p>I wasn't expelled, merely suspended for the next two terms. In that time, I had to attend all sorts of meetings with Mum, who had to take God knows how many (unpaid) days off work. She was raising a family of four singlehandedly and needed every penny. But her commitment to my education was unflagging. The next couple of years were a complete waste of time. At 15, I left without any qualifications. I couldn't wait to see the back of the place. </p> <p>Now closed, after being dubbed the worst school in Britain, Hackney Downs comp stands as a haunting symbol of squandered opportunity. Nearby is Sandringham Road, the old 'front line', where I spent years dealing. I hardly recognise it. Gone are the derelict shop fronts, the West Indian takeaways, the 'community' centre, the shebeens, the abandoned cars, the people, the noise. My most abiding memory of that time is the sense of camaraderie that existed between the dealers. In those days, the front was a no-go area, and if the police came anywhere near it we'd rain missiles down on them. And if one of our ranks got arrested, the rest of us would march on Stokey Station, demanding his release. </p> <p>Things always seemed to happen on Sandringnham Road. One day, in the mid Eighties, I was hanging with my crew - Manny, Muff, Skinner, Stroller and Big Man. It was a quiet day, no trade to speak of, but a gorgeous midsummer afternoon. A few yards along the pavement, two 10-year-old boys were playing football. Their mothers were inside Lion's takeaway. After a few minutes, a ball rolled into the road. One of the boys ran after it and straight into an oncoming car. The car hit him with such force that he was lifted clean out of his little trainers and dragged beneath the car a full 50 yards before the driver was able to stop. </p> <p>For a few seconds, we all froze. Shock turned to horror and then to anger. The driver of the car held his head in his hands as the mother cradled her son and wailed uncontrollably. </p> <p>Big Man punched the driver in the jaw. He staggered and fell. The rest of us were about to pounce on him when the mother ordered us to leave him alone. So we lashed out at his car. The police soon arrived in full riot gear only to see us comforting a grieving mother. The child lived, but would never again have the use of his arms or legs. Those kind of things happened on Sandringham Road. Back then. </p> <p>Now the 'front' a residential street like any other, complete with sleeping policemen. I sit on the front wall of a newly-built row of maisonettes. A young white couple walk by, wearing trainers. In another time, I'd have propositioned them to buy drugs. They eye me suspiciously and I realise how conspicuous I must look. I hurry away before anyone has a chance to call the police. </p> <p>I head for Jessup's, an illegal gambling house just off Kingsland High Street. Walking into the dingy old basement is like stepping back in time. Hardly anything has changed, least of all the decor. The clientele, mostly immigrants who came over in the Sixties, sit around playing kalouki, a Jewish card game. Weed smoke hangs heavy in the air. This is a subterranean world where time stands still, a sanctuary for the disaffected and the disillusioned. I can see now why I spent so much time hanging out there. </p> <p>Although I'm recognised and acknowledged, there's none of the exuberance I encountered earlier in the park. Mine is just an old face resurfaced, like so many others. Where I've been and what I've been up to is of no interest to these old timers. I spend the next hour warming myself in front of the gas heater. </p> <p>The last time I'd been to Jessup's was a little different. It was at the height of my addiction in the late Eighties. My mate Narrow and I had been free-basing in my flat for five hours non-stop. We hadn't eaten or slept in days. One of us was bound to lose it and it just happened to be me. I'd just smoked my umpteenth rock and Narrow was preparing the pipe for his. My electricity supply had been cut and we were smoking by the light of a solitary candle. Perhaps it was a trick of the gloomy light but Narrow took on a monstrous aspect that terrified me. He appeared to be growing before my very eyes. I screamed and backed into a corner. Narrow moved towards me, his words soothing, his arms outstretched. Paranoid, I knocked him out of the way and ran for my life. </p> <p>I fled like a madman. Eventually, exhausted, I found myself outside Jessup's. It was as though I'd been directed there by divine intervention. Everything I needed just then could be found inside its walls: peace, safety, and the counsel of wise old men. </p> <p>I move on, heading north up Kingsland Road and into Stoke Newington, a real dump when I was growing up but now gentrified. I catch sight of the police station. It's now a gleaming, high-tech building - the stuff of design awards. Very different from the dilapidated hellhole it was in the Eighties. </p> <p>I leave Stokey Station, turn down a side road. Every other house has a sign outside it. I get to Church Street and realise I could just as easily be in Islington. There are even bookshops, unheard of in my day. I'm about to go into one of these when I turn to see a silver Golf GTI pulling up beside me. The driver quickly gets out, rushes up to me and slams me up against the bookshop window. It's only when he speaks that I realise he doesn't intend me any harm, that he is, in fact, Manny, one of my old sparring partners. </p> <p>Manny and I go back to his house to catch up. I go first, and Manny listens attentively, asking questions, getting me to repeat things. He's particularly interested in my rehab stories. I tell him about the urine samples, about the midnight curfew, the therapy sessions, the cold turkey, the anxiety attacks, the panic attacks, the sleepless nights. Manny congratulates me on my 'great escape', then tells me how, for a time after I left, he got into cocaine trafficking. He mentions so many airports, in so many exotic locations, I become enthralled. But that's behind him now, he says. He's been 'legit' these past few years. Using his ill-gotten gains, he now runs a secondhand car dealership, specialising in German cars. 'Need a Beamer, I'm your man.' </p> <p>I ask about the others. 'Muff's doing a nine stretch. Aggravated burglary. If he's lucky he'll hit road in 2006. Skinner's in and out the nuthouse. Drugged up to the eyeballs. Stroller's selling bone from his drum. Bigman's brown bread. Took on some Yardies.' Manny crosses himself and says: 'RIP.' </p> <p>It's gone 10 when I arrive back at Hackney Downs Station. It's only five minutes until the next train but I'm anxious to quit the deserted platform. In the half-light at the far end of the platform, I notice a spectral figure standing with hunched shoulders, protecting himself against the fierce wind. </p> <p>I make the mistake of staring at him too long and groan when I see him approaching. He's dressed in rags. He wreaks of stale alcohol. I'm about to shoo him away when it dawns on me that I know him. His name's Sparkle (because of all the gold he used to wear) and he was a player way back when. Without thinking I shout: 'Sparkle, man! What happened to you?' </p> <p>As though he and I had seen each other every day for the past 10 years, he says: 'Lend us a fiver, Fats.' I look him up and down, waiting for him to say he's only joking. When it's obvious he isn't, I shake my head and delve into my pocket. I've got \u00a33.50. For a moment, I think I'll need it to get back to Notting Hill, but then I remember I'd bought a travelcard. I hand him the money and watch him disappear down the steps and presumably out of the station. Seconds later my train pulls in. </p> <p>As I'm about to get on, I think: if he wasn't waiting for the train, what was Sparkle doing on the platform? </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Thompson's Toy Soldiers is published by Sceptre this week, \u00a310</p>",

My electricity supply had been cut and we were smoking by the light of a solitary candle. Perhaps it was a trick of the gloomy light but Narrow took on a monstrous aspect that terrified me. He appeared to be growing before my very eyes. I screamed and backed into a corner. Narrow moved towards me, his words soothing, his arms outstretched. Paranoid, I knocked him out of the way and ran for my life. I fled like a madman. Eventually, exhausted, I found myself outside Jessup's. It was as though I'd been directed there by divine intervention. Everything I needed just then could be found inside its walls: peace, safety, and the counsel of wise old men. I move on, heading north up Kingsland Road and into Stoke Newington, a real dump when I was growing up but now gentrified. I catch sight of the police station. It's now a gleaming, high-tech building - the stuff of design awards. Very different from the dilapidated hellhole it was in the Eighties. I leave Stokey Station, turn down a side road. Every other house has a sign outside it. I get to Church Street and realise I could just as easily be in Islington. There are even bookshops, unheard of in my day. I'm about to go into one of these when I turn to see a silver Golf GTI pulling up beside me. The driver quickly gets out, rushes up to me and slams me up against the bookshop window. It's only when he speaks that I realise he doesn't intend me any harm, that he is, in fact, Manny, one of my old sparring partners. Manny and I go back to his house to catch up. I go first, and Manny listens attentively, asking questions, getting me to repeat things. He's particularly interested in my rehab stories. I tell him about the urine samples, about the midnight curfew, the therapy sessions, the cold turkey, the anxiety attacks, the panic attacks, the sleepless nights. Manny congratulates me on my 'great escape', then tells me how, for a time after I left, he got into cocaine trafficking. He mentions so many airports, in so many exotic locations, I become enthralled. But that's behind him now, he says. He's been 'legit' these past few years. Using his ill-gotten gains, he now runs a secondhand car dealership, specialising in German cars. 'Need a Beamer, I'm your man.' I ask about the others. 'Muff's doing a nine stretch. Aggravated burglary. If he's lucky he'll hit road in 2006. Skinner's in and out the nuthouse. Drugged up to the eyeballs. Stroller's selling bone from his drum. Bigman's brown bread. Took on some Yardies.' Manny crosses himself and says: 'RIP.' It's gone 10 when I arrive back at Hackney Downs Station. It's only five minutes until the next train but I'm anxious to quit the deserted platform. In the half-light at the far end of the platform, I notice a spectral figure standing with hunched shoulders, protecting himself against the fierce wind. I make the mistake of staring at him too long and groan when I see him approaching. He's dressed in rags. He wreaks of stale alcohol. I'm about to shoo him away when it dawns on me that I know him. His name's Sparkle (because of all the gold he used to wear) and he was a player way back when. Without thinking I shout: 'Sparkle, man! What happened to you?' As though he and I had seen each other every day for the past 10 years, he says: 'Lend us a fiver, Fats.' I look him up and down, waiting for him to say he's only joking. When it's obvious he isn't, I shake my head and delve into my pocket. I've got \u00a33.50. For a moment, I think I'll need it to get back to Notting Hill, but then I remember I'd bought a travelcard. I hand him the money and watch him disappear down the steps and presumably out of the station. Seconds later my train pulls in. As I'm about to get on, I think: if he wasn't waiting for the train, what was Sparkle doing on the platform? \u0095 Stephen Thompson's Toy Soldiers is published by Sceptre this week, \u00a310",

      "body": "<p>Somewhere near the middle of Linn Ullmann's first novel, Before You Sleep, the narrator and her father discuss her sister's troubles. 'What's the point of marriage if he's not making her happy?' she asks. The father replies: 'I don't understand who told you that the point of anything is to be happy.' </p> <p>It seems perfect that this line should have been written by the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. Linn Ullmann smiles when I mention it: 'Yeah. My father said that to me once.' But she is quick to dismiss any easy associations: 'If people want to make connections with my father's work - to detect Bergmanesque themes in it - that's OK,' she says. 'But it's hard for me talk about what is a natural influence. Obviously there's an influence but I don't know in what way or to what degree. Both my parents are great storytellers.' </p> <p>It must be one of the questions she is asked most frequently, and she responds with gracious discretion. 'It's not a dramatic thing that I choose not to speak about my parents,' she explains. 'If they come up in conversation, I'll talk about them. But it's important to make clear that this book is fiction, and it has very little to do with them.' </p> <p>Ullmann herself is so engaging that she quickly makes curiosity about the rest of her family fall away. We meet at her apartment in Oslo, where she lives with her nine-year-old son. It's a large, light place full of books and comfortable corners for reading. She has a firm handshake and a sharp mind - her conversation tumbles out, sparkling and thoughtful, as if she spends a lot of time testing the logic of impossible-seeming things. Her English is impeccably American, learnt at a school for professional children in New York, and perfected over years of postgraduate study at NYU. She has a lovely, pixie-ish face and her mother's lips. </p> <p> Before You Sleep is a wonderful novel, a meandering family narrative, told by a dishonest heroine and peopled with haunting snapshots. It comes across, in the main, as realistic, since Karin, the narrator, is chatty and imaginative and carries the reader along with her. But every now and then a surreal element is introduced - a lover turns into a mackerel, for example; or an image recurs like a muted nightmare - a husband wakes up in the night and sees a rock in the bed between him and his wife; or a perfectly simple event seeps through the rest of the book and becomes a character's whole foundation - Karin remembers her suicidal sister as a child, standing on the balcony of their home, throwing all her belongings down to her classmates, who are eagerly catching them in the snow. Here is a young girl throwing away her life, trying to get rid of the parts of herself that she can separate, and for her friends it's just raining gifts. 'Please,' Karin shouts, 'Please. Can't you please stop? These are Julie's things, not yours.' </p> <p>As a writer, Ullmann has an extraordinary touch, and it's interesting to hear her speak so eloquently in person. Part of this is the way she talks about the act of writing itself - she imagines a book in terms of its 'lighting', its colours. She uses an almost filmic language: 'I had an idea of the structure before I had all the story: I knew that the first part would be carnivalesque, this long party that never ends, intoxicated almost. And I always knew that the ending would be very quiet and very still and very naked, and tender, and black in some ways - black and white in equal measure.' And as a critic of her own work she exhibits some of the nonchalant, freewheeling logic of her narrator (Ullmann is a critic as well as a novelist, and still has a regular column in the Norwegian daily paper Dagbladet). </p> <p>'I don't find the fact of Carl turning into a fish particularly surreal,' she tells me. 'I guess it depends on whether you've experienced that or not. The idea that your lover turns into a fish - I don't even find it that imaginative. It's a literary archetype. But there have been a lot of responses to that scene. One guy came up to me and said, \"I totally identify with that because once I was a mackerel.\" And another time,when I gave a reading in a fishing region in the north of Norway, a burly guy who looked like a fisherman got up and said, \"You know, that scene you wrote about the guy turning into a mackerel - I don't believe it, it's totally unbelievable.\" And I said, OK, I can understand that. \"The thing is,\" he said, \"Karin puts him in a bowl of fresh water - mackerel is a salt water fish. He would never have survived!\" </p> <p>'So,' Ullmann concludes, laughing, 'where you start believing is all a matter of perception.' </p> <p>Ullmann is not exactly Karin ('all of the characters are parts of me,' she says), but some of the pleasure in talking to her is exactly the pleasure in reading her book - just have a cup of coffee with her and you can see that sensibility at work. Listen, for example, to why she has never managed to pass her driving test: 'If it was just me and the car, I think I'd be fine. But the driving instructor kept telling me to make friends with the traffic and I just did not trust it. I mean, you know what it's like if you're a critic, you read every sign as potentially ironic. I was supposed to go right and I'd go left - it was ridiculous. Also, I took driving lessons at a critical point in my life, when things were changing a lot, and I took everything the instructor said to mean something very deep. So he'd say, \"You can't brake and accelerate at the same time\", and I'd nod slowly, thinking, no, you can't, can you? Or he'd say, \"You drive like you just want to get out of here\", and I'd shout, \"Yes, I do! Doesn't everyone want to be anywhere but here?\".' </p> <p>This is Ullmann's slant on life - anything might be funny, or fatal; there is metaphysical potential all around us. She tells me about the films she grew up with, films which mean a lot to her. 'I cherish the movies,' she says. Bergman's eight children, of whom Ullmann is the youngest, still visit him every summer on Faro, the island he has made his home. He has converted a barn into a cinema, and he screens a movie a day, except on Saturdays, when there are two.</p> <p>Ullmann says she has 'a thing about musical comedies - Singing In the Rain - I love the idea that they're doing this just for us to be happy!' Others she defends with more rigour. Fellini's Amarcord, for example. And then there are some films which seem, as our conversation drifts, to explain everything - about the way Ullmann thinks and writes, about the rules she may have lived by: farce as a form of freedom, catastrophe waiting to happen. 'You know,' she says, 'if someone said to me, \"I don't like Chaplin's Modern Times\", I'd think, What do we have to talk about? What is your life?'</p>",

Seal visits India (for cobras), Australia (taipans), Africa (black mambas) and America (rattlesnakes). But in some respects, this isn't a book about snakes at all; they're just the wriggly pegs from which Seal hangs his observations. </p> <p>He's excellent on the unexpected ways in which different cultures reveal themselves; from the invariably barking first colonial settlers (one new Australian's letter home concludes with a poignant, not to say optimistic, request for 'snails' and 'hedgehogs'), to the wily ways of Indian snake charmers who train their cobras not to strike by aiming them at heated saucepans: 'Soon enough they get a jolly hot nose. After that, they don't strike any more.

Applied to mythology's most evil women, this superstition seems quite reasonable, what with Melusine's hissy fits, Lamia 'all slither and venom' and, of course, Eve's new best friend. </p> <p>Husain's demon ladies have their unorthodox moments, such as Sheba extolling the virtues of hairy legs to an unconvinced Solomon, but on the whole they're all tail and no tooth. 'Eve,' Husain tells us, 'always makes me think of a non-conformist living in a smug, conventional suburb. She needs a subversive friend, or a therapist, to encourage her to make the choices.' Nothing like a therapist for taking the sting out of a story. </p> <p><strong> Fruit of the Lemon</strong> </p> <p>Andrea Levy</p> <p>Hodder Headline Review \u00a36.99, pp340<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501838864,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Faith Jackson's parents were born in Jamaica, a place she's never been to and knows little about. She's grown up in grey north London and wants nothing more than to be ordinary, but in Britain in the Eighties Faith cannot seem to live a colourless life. The odd way in which racism manages to inflect the most banal situations gives rise to some wry black comedy, comedy that turns to tragedy when Faith witnesses a violent attack. </p> <p>Seeking comfort, she visits Aunt Coral in Jamaica - 'This me niece, cha!' - where she discovers a family tree of cheerful complexity, and with it a new confidence in her identity as a 'bastard child of Empire'. </p> <p>If Levy's structure is a sometimes a little stilted, her command of voices, whether English or Jamaican, is fine, fresh and funny. </p> <p><strong> The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon</strong> </p> <p>Richard Zimler<br>Arcadia \u00a311.99, pp318<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501042218,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Berekiah Zarco lives in early sixteenth-century Portugal.

      "bodyText": "The Snakebite Survivors' Club Jeremy Seal Picador \u00a36.99, pp377 This is an energetic romp, or rather tiptoe, through every conceivable type of snake terrain. Seal visits India (for cobras), Australia (taipans), Africa (black mambas) and America (rattlesnakes). But in some respects, this isn't a book about snakes at all; they're just the wriggly pegs from which Seal hangs his observations. He's excellent on the unexpected ways in which different cultures reveal themselves; from the invariably barking first colonial settlers (one new Australian's letter home concludes with a poignant, not to say optimistic, request for 'snails' and 'hedgehogs'), to the wily ways of Indian snake charmers who train their cobras not to strike by aiming them at heated saucepans: 'Soon enough they get a jolly hot nose. After that, they don't strike any more. Well, not often, anyway.' Temptresses: the Virago Book of Evil Women Shakrukh Husain Virago \u00a36.99, pp212 Buy it at BOL Jeremy Seal records an African belief that we're reincarnated as snakes (according to status, of course - commoners come back as humble grass snakes). Applied to mythology's most evil women, this superstition seems quite reasonable, what with Melusine's hissy fits, Lamia 'all slither and venom' and, of course, Eve's new best friend. Husain's demon ladies have their unorthodox moments, such as Sheba extolling the virtues of hairy legs to an unconvinced Solomon, but on the whole they're all tail and no tooth. 'Eve,' Husain tells us, 'always makes me think of a non-conformist living in a smug, conventional suburb. She needs a subversive friend, or a therapist, to encourage her to make the choices.' Nothing like a therapist for taking the sting out of a story. Fruit of the Lemon Andrea Levy Hodder Headline Review \u00a36.99, pp340 Buy it at BOL Faith Jackson's parents were born in Jamaica, a place she's never been to and knows little about. She's grown up in grey north London and wants nothing more than to be ordinary, but in Britain in the Eighties Faith cannot seem to live a colourless life. The odd way in which racism manages to inflect the most banal situations gives rise to some wry black comedy, comedy that turns to tragedy when Faith witnesses a violent attack. Seeking comfort, she visits Aunt Coral in Jamaica - 'This me niece, cha!' - where she discovers a family tree of cheerful complexity, and with it a new confidence in her identity as a 'bastard child of Empire'. If Levy's structure is a sometimes a little stilted, her command of voices, whether English or Jamaican, is fine, fresh and funny. The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon Richard Zimler Arcadia \u00a311.99, pp318 Buy it at BOL Berekiah Zarco lives in early sixteenth-century Portugal. He's supposedly a 'New Christian', forced to convert from Judaism after King Manuel's 1497 decree. But in fact he's a Kabbalist Jew, as is his uncle Abraham. Mystic powers are no defence against mystery assassins, however, and Uncle is soon found naked and dead in a sealed room. Berekiah's detective challenge is rather complicated by Lisbon's sudden eruption into gross anti-Jewish violence, and the reader who wishes to join the hero in his hunt for the murderer must wade through pages of graphic bloodletting (whipping with broken glass, anyone?), while keeping a look out for lots of symbolist clues. The Last Kabbalist has many similarities with The Name of the Rose, but Eco's postmodern sophistication is here upstaged by a brasher, uglier focus on sex and violence.

The nautical 'drift', the sea and water, are ever present, most specifically in the context of the boat, the youthful romanticism of the poetic bateau ivre struggling against the harsh truth of social necessity, the effects of time and growing middle-aged. There is something refreshingly honest about the poet's self-analysis. What is mine, what is family inheritance, who does memory belong to? But it's not as easy as that. There are possibilities of negotiating in the grey area between thought and writing, cognition and speech. </p> <p>This is also poetry of class - what constitutes our social environment, or more specifically, a specific English upbringing. The love poems in this tight collection are powerful for the same reason: assessing how memory alters and recreates a relationship. They are not weighed down by sanctimonious regret. </p> <p>These are really poems of self-psychoanalysis. In the elegiac 'Brighton Return', we read: 'to you he was the chosen one, the brother you'd never had'. There is a vague, suppressed sexuality at work here, but it is left aside for the safer ground of recollection. Both this and 'The Short Straw' lament the physical loss of someone once very close and the loss of personal vision. Jenkins recognises that his address to the dead is an address to what's deadened in himself. </p> <p>The book exhibits the tension between the poet maudit and the 'citizen' he has become. It's this ambivalence that drives the craft, the currents moving below the surface that draw up the new, the unpredictable, that will free memory from guilt: </p> <p> Your verse bobs like a little yacht <br>in heavy seas, dismasted, it veers and bobs and weaves <br>as if it were the Galatea at the mercy of great waves <br>as if the helmsman were unfit <br>(From 'Salt') </p> <p> 'Street Life' is almost Conradian in its resignation to the presence of darkness in the human soul - 'I paid her twenty quid and pushed it up her, dry and tight.' This is informed and learned poetry, but always available, familiar, and non-pedantic. </p> <p>What links this collection and Jo Shapcott's work distinctly is the motif of gender and the environment of class. But Shapcott is an altogether different poet, doing no less than rewriting the English poetic canon - challenging sources, verse structure and the primacy of the patriarchal voice. </p> <p>Shapcott has a brilliant sense of how the line can be played against to enhance meaning, to make a point about tone and speed by turning before we expect her to. Like all great satirists, she is both part of the culture she is analysing, and able to step, momentarily, outside it. </p> <p><strong> Her Book</strong> is a 'compendium' of Shapcott's three previously published books. It isn't a large oeuvre but then there is no excess. Shapcott anticipates her critics at every turn.

      "bodyText": "The Drift Alan Jenkins Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a38.99, pp64 Buy it at BOL Her Book Jo Shapcott Faber &amp; Faber \u00a38.99, pp125 Buy it at BOL In his fourth collection of poetry, The Drift, Alan Jenkins utilises well-honed prosodic skills to stabilise memory, to anchor sense in the flow of recollection. The nautical 'drift', the sea and water, are ever present, most specifically in the context of the boat, the youthful romanticism of the poetic bateau ivre struggling against the harsh truth of social necessity, the effects of time and growing middle-aged. There is something refreshingly honest about the poet's self-analysis. What is mine, what is family inheritance, who does memory belong to? But it's not as easy as that. There are possibilities of negotiating in the grey area between thought and writing, cognition and speech. This is also poetry of class - what constitutes our social environment, or more specifically, a specific English upbringing. The love poems in this tight collection are powerful for the same reason: assessing how memory alters and recreates a relationship. They are not weighed down by sanctimonious regret. These are really poems of self-psychoanalysis. In the elegiac 'Brighton Return', we read: 'to you he was the chosen one, the brother you'd never had'. There is a vague, suppressed sexuality at work here, but it is left aside for the safer ground of recollection. Both this and 'The Short Straw' lament the physical loss of someone once very close and the loss of personal vision. Jenkins recognises that his address to the dead is an address to what's deadened in himself. The book exhibits the tension between the poet maudit and the 'citizen' he has become. It's this ambivalence that drives the craft, the currents moving below the surface that draw up the new, the unpredictable, that will free memory from guilt: Your verse bobs like a little yacht in heavy seas, dismasted, it veers and bobs and weaves as if it were the Galatea at the mercy of great waves as if the helmsman were unfit (From 'Salt') 'Street Life' is almost Conradian in its resignation to the presence of darkness in the human soul - 'I paid her twenty quid and pushed it up her, dry and tight.' This is informed and learned poetry, but always available, familiar, and non-pedantic. What links this collection and Jo Shapcott's work distinctly is the motif of gender and the environment of class. But Shapcott is an altogether different poet, doing no less than rewriting the English poetic canon - challenging sources, verse structure and the primacy of the patriarchal voice. Shapcott has a brilliant sense of how the line can be played against to enhance meaning, to make a point about tone and speed by turning before we expect her to. Like all great satirists, she is both part of the culture she is analysing, and able to step, momentarily, outside it. Her Book is a 'compendium' of Shapcott's three previously published books. It isn't a large oeuvre but then there is no excess. Shapcott anticipates her critics at every turn. The conflation of poetry, sexism, language, the media and even economics is brilliantly conveyed in her well-known 'Mad Cow' poems. A small, neat poem that might be read as a mini ars poetica is 'Watching Medusa', bearing in mind Cixous's essay 'The Laugh of the Medusa'. 'Struck dumb', the Medusa-watcher tells us: 'I cannot speak or move/ in case I do wrong to her and/ close the sweet hissing mouths.' In this poem, the muse is 'rescued' - reclaimed from the male poet. The rules have changed, and whose rules were they in the first place? In a Shapcott poem, Tom and Jerry can be acting out a storyline in England - 'swished my axe at Jerry, belted after him/ into the Bloody Tower, my back legs/ circling like windmills in a gale'; nothing is sacred. In an early poem like 'With the Big Tray', Shapcott casually deconstructs the traditional male artist's gaze. The 'nude descending the staircase' motif is inverted, and the play with gender expectation is deft and unrelenting: The sun constructed an avenue to the bedside table and now the housefly played boomerang in and out of the light. Hilary surprised herself by breaking wind. Secretly, her large smell made her feel real and salty as a merchant adventurer.",

The great statesman and diplomat Hubert Languet, who acted as his mentor during the three years of his Grand Tour, remarked after his only visit to England that 'the habits of your court seemed to me somewhat less manly than I could have wished'. </p> <p>Stewart records an even more thought-provoking comment by Sir Francis Walsingham, who got to know Sidney during his momentous year in Paris, a year that reached a climax in the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, that the 19-year-old was 'in danger of a very lewd practice' because of the 'evil practice' of his personal servants. However, Stewart suggests only that Walsingham, wise and well-travelled diplomat though he was, 'instinctively distrusted' Sidney's servants because one of them was a denizened Italian, one a Welshman. </p> <p>Nor is anything made of the mild oddity that in this period in which advantageous marriage was a virtually compulsory career move for any ambitious courtier, neither of Sidney's close courtier friends, Fulke Greville or Edward Dyer, ever took this step. </p> <p>Indeed, like many other aspects of his extraordinary short life, testimony to Sidney's sexuality is scarcely examined, neither Aubrey's claim that he had an incestuous career with his sister, nor ample evidence in Sidney's own writings that his enthusiasm for the Ciceronian virtue of male friendship included an acknowledgement of physical attraction, as when the older of the two young heroes of the Arcadia is attracted to his cousin and best friend when he is dressed up as an Amazon. </p> <p>Another possibility, I hoped, was that Stewart might have investigated the 'double' nature of Sidney's life in the sense of 'duplicity', perhaps giving Sidney and his huge network of political and diplomatic correspondents the sort of John Le Carr\u00e9-wards make-over that Charles Nicholl devised for Christopher Marlowe in The Reckoning (1992). </p> <p>Given Sidney's insistence on including within his circle both English Catholic exiles and continental Catholics, there might have been room for exploring the possibility that, as John Buxton once hinted, Sidney was some sort of spy, who used his charm and linguistic ability to win the trust of such men, in the hope of rewards at home. But this avenue isn't opened either. </p> <p>Stewart's treatment of religious and political issues is disappointingly simplistic. Sidney is flatly described as coming from 'a prominent Protestant family', which hardly takes into account the fact that his parents had been flourishing courtiers during the reign of Mary Tudor, so flourishing, indeed, that baby Philip had Mary's consort Philip of Spain as his godfather. </p> <p>Nor does Stewart face the implications of the undoubted facts that Sidney's father saved the life of the Jesuit Edmund Campion in 1571, hurrying him out of Ireland to avoid arrest; that Philip himself went out of his way to talk to Campion in Prague in 1577; and that his uncle, the Earl of Leicester, actively intervened to improve the conditions of Campion's imprisonment in the Tower in 1582. If the Queen repeatedly showed suspicion of the Sidney circle's true allegiance, either to her own authority or to the reformed religion, perhaps she had good reason. </p> <p>It turns out that, as in the Edwardian music-hall song, 'You can't tell what's inside the pot by the label on the jam'. The concept of a 'double life' seems to have been an afterthought or marketing device.

But if that is meant to support the 'doubleness' of the title, it is not convincing. </p> <p>Much is made of Sidney's activities as a 'networker' - rather than 'soldier' - but virtually nothing of his writing. For instance, his slippery and much-debated poem on monarchy and tyranny is described as 'a fairly simple beast fable'.

There is the childless woman pushing a pram down the street, the boy with a key who owns nothing, the quiet receptionist in a passionate yellow skirt. 'We cannot live without our illusions,' thinks one character, an anonymous, middle-aged citizen in his wife's lace-trimmed nightgown. </p> <p>This is Carol Shields's third collection of short stories. Her reputation as a novelist tends to overshadow the fact that she also writes drama, poetry, short fiction and literary criticism. There are 22 stories here, none of them more than a dozen pages, some much shorter. Many are too short for their own good. </p> <p>'She is no longer just Tamara,' Shields writes of the yellow-dressed receptionist, 'but a woman in a yellow skirt. A passionate woman dressed in yellow. A Passionate, Vibrant Woman About To Begin Her Day, Her Life.' This is vibrant prose, breaking out in italicised and capitalised exclamations. There are times when it becomes so vibrant that you wonder why it doesn't slow down. </p> <p>Her writing has always been finely balanced, accuracy a counterweight for tenderness. In these stories, the precision is often absent and the balance disturbed. She is not a hard writer, but in her best work she has the measure of her characters and her gaze is unswerving. In this collection, it is the opposite, never settling on one thing for more than a moment. The shortest stories often leave a sense of subjects snatched at or avoided. This is fast-food Shields. </p> <p>When the illness of an author is made public, as Shields's cancer has been, it inevitably presents critics with a dilemma: is a review ever for the author? Sense says not, but in the book world this is less than the whole truth. It is difficult to write a bloodlessly honest review of Dressing up for the Carnival because while there is good in it, it is not Shields's best work and a significant part of the problem lies in the absence of darkness.</p> <p>The predominant atmosphere of these stories is a strained positivity, particularly near the beginning of the book. 'Happiness' is a word that crops up with an alarming frequency. Many of the stories are happiness trips, landscapes without shadows. There is something in this for Shields as much as for her readership, and this raises a question that echoes the first: is a story ever for the storyteller? To which the broad answer is no; public prose is for the public. </p> <p>Shields is too good a writer not to recognise these problems herself, and two of the stories - 'A Scarf' and 'Edith-Esther' - examine them directly. Both feature novelist protagonists, though the fictions they create are quite different. Reta Winters has written the feelgood My Thyme Is Up, 'a fresh, bright, springtime piece of fiction', though 'there was, my daughters postulated, maybe too much over-the-top sweetness about the thyme seeds Alicia planted in her window-box.' Alone on tour, Reta discovers that: 'The radio stations avoided novels unless they had a \"topic\" like cancer.' She herself is a giver, with something for everyone - a scarf for her daughter, conversation for a friend - and everything in return. </p> <p>In contrast, the eponymous heroine of the second story is an author whose work is 'Bleak... or when she wants to treat herself more kindly, austere.' Edith-Esther 'had refused to offer her readers the least crumb of comfort' and her comeuppance is a matter of poetic justice. There is a sense in this book that, at the moment, Shields would rather be the first author than the second. Little is gained in the decision for the reader and much lost.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Marcel Proust: Selected Letters Volume IV 1918-1922</strong><br>Edited by Philip Kolb, translated by Joanna Kilmartin<br>HarperCollins \u00a340, pp518<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502349059,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>In The run-up to the new millennium much was written about new dawns and striding confidently towards a pan-European future. Yet even before we had seen out January, the literary world was renewing its homage to Marcel Proust, a novelist celebrated for directing his attention towards the past.</p> <p>January 2000 saw the publication of the final volume of Proust's selected letters in English, coinciding with the release of Chilean director Raoul Ruiz's film Time Regained (based on the closing volume of Proust's monumental novel, In Search of Lost Time), and a major exhibition of Proust manuscripts and memorabilia at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris. Later this year, there will be an English edition of Jean-Yves Tadi\u00e9's new biography.</p> <p>Why the clamour now? In September 1922, two months before his death, Proust wrote to the critic Ren\u00e9 Gillouin reproaching him for asserting in his review of the most recently published volume of In Search of Lost Time that Proust was suffering from a 'severely neuro-pathological condition'. Alas, responded Proust, his illness was all-too real: 'Unfortunately for me, your diagnosis of my condition in your splendid article is incorrect.'</p> <p>Still, Proust, an assiduous carper at reviewers who misrepresented him, was by and large complimentary, congratulating Gillouin on 'the exceptional beauties, the profound insights' of his review. 'We never cease to be surprised,' Gillouin had written, 'at what M. Proust reveals to us about ourselves simply through talking aloud in our presence. On the other hand, his illness introduces a strongly morbid element, tackling certain aspects of reality which, till now, have been the subject of treatises by doctors and psychiatrists, or else obscene books carried under a raincoat. M. Proust's writing is the literary equivalent of Freud's psychoanalysis.'</p> <p>It is, I suggest, just these qualities detected by Gillouin which account for today's resurgence of interest in In Search of Lost Time and for the curious place it occupies in the vanguard of work which commands twenty-first-century critical attention.</p> <p>Proust's long, meandering masterpiece is absorbed with the way we hold in our minds memories of a lifetime of experiences, some trivial, some conventionally memorable. The past is the residual trace of events in the mind - we are each the accumulation of our past, nothing is lost or forgotten, everything that lies behind us in time goes towards the construction of our present self. The responsibility for all lasting memory resides within us.</p> <p>History is past events refracted through our mental lens - Proust likened it to looking backwards through a telescope.

      "bodyText": "Marcel Proust: Selected Letters Volume IV 1918-1922 Edited by Philip Kolb, translated by Joanna Kilmartin HarperCollins \u00a340, pp518 Buy it at BOL In The run-up to the new millennium much was written about new dawns and striding confidently towards a pan-European future. Yet even before we had seen out January, the literary world was renewing its homage to Marcel Proust, a novelist celebrated for directing his attention towards the past. January 2000 saw the publication of the final volume of Proust's selected letters in English, coinciding with the release of Chilean director Raoul Ruiz's film Time Regained (based on the closing volume of Proust's monumental novel, In Search of Lost Time), and a major exhibition of Proust manuscripts and memorabilia at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris. Later this year, there will be an English edition of Jean-Yves Tadi\u00e9's new biography. Why the clamour now? In September 1922, two months before his death, Proust wrote to the critic Ren\u00e9 Gillouin reproaching him for asserting in his review of the most recently published volume of In Search of Lost Time that Proust was suffering from a 'severely neuro-pathological condition'. Alas, responded Proust, his illness was all-too real: 'Unfortunately for me, your diagnosis of my condition in your splendid article is incorrect.' Still, Proust, an assiduous carper at reviewers who misrepresented him, was by and large complimentary, congratulating Gillouin on 'the exceptional beauties, the profound insights' of his review. 'We never cease to be surprised,' Gillouin had written, 'at what M. Proust reveals to us about ourselves simply through talking aloud in our presence. On the other hand, his illness introduces a strongly morbid element, tackling certain aspects of reality which, till now, have been the subject of treatises by doctors and psychiatrists, or else obscene books carried under a raincoat. M. Proust's writing is the literary equivalent of Freud's psychoanalysis.' It is, I suggest, just these qualities detected by Gillouin which account for today's resurgence of interest in In Search of Lost Time and for the curious place it occupies in the vanguard of work which commands twenty-first-century critical attention. Proust's long, meandering masterpiece is absorbed with the way we hold in our minds memories of a lifetime of experiences, some trivial, some conventionally memorable. The past is the residual trace of events in the mind - we are each the accumulation of our past, nothing is lost or forgotten, everything that lies behind us in time goes towards the construction of our present self. The responsibility for all lasting memory resides within us. History is past events refracted through our mental lens - Proust likened it to looking backwards through a telescope. The frivolous figures on the same scale as the fundamental. At the same time, In Search of Lost Time is a kind of Freudian 'talking cure' in which the richness of the narrator's stream of consciousness justifies his present state of lassitude. And the story-telling is a project in its own right - it literally keeps him alive. At the end of the final volume, Marcel compares himself to the narrator in the Thousand and One Nights - as long as he keeps telling his stories, he stands a chance of living to see the next day dawn. For the reader, entering wholeheartedly into the remembered life of Marcel means coming to terms with the dashed hopes and emotional disappointments of an entire generation. Faced with the inevitability of death, Proust's narrator dedicates himself to leaving posterity a record of the memorial history his mind has assembled with a kind of brittle brilliance. Even so, as Proust observes in a footnote to the final segment of Time Regained: 'No doubt my books too, like my flesh and blood, will eventually die. But one must resign oneself to death. One accepts the thought that in 100 years even one's books will not survive.' In Search of Lost Time resonates compellingly for an age which has seen the emergence of a whole new genre of plangently self-scrutinising writing in the form of the testimonies of a generation living in the shadow of HIV - culturally telling writing which includes Edmund White's The Farewell Symphony and Derek Jarman's Modern Nature. Like these, Proust's tale of a man in a fragile state of health for whom Parisian high life and its erotic and intellectual attractions prove fatally irresistible, retrospectively romanticises recklessness. It addresses a prevailing tendency in fiction and non-fiction to rank the historically insignificant, passive onlooker's personalised view above more conventionally grand narratives. These are themes whose general celebration surely sends out profoundly pessimistic messages about ourselves, entirely at odds with the triumphalism of the Millennium Dome. We might link them with the decision of the Whitbread judges and the South Bank Show to award their annual prizes to Seamus Heaney's version of Beowulf, an Anglo-Saxon poem from the first millennium, and obsolete cornerstone of old-fashioned university courses in English literature. Beowulf is a saga of a warrior's struggle against evil. Yet the poem's dominant tone is one of loss and regret. And indeed, since Tolkien's influential essay on the poem in 1936 it has been consistently read as a lament for Beowulf's society and its values, a poetic evocation of a lost world, rather than an emotional rallying point for our future. Heaney has explained that, for him, 'poetry helps us to live our lives in the face of destruction'. But when did we decide, as a critical community, to abandon the optimism and hope with which we greeted 2000? I, for one, continue to hold those cultural and political high hopes, and for all my long-standing attachment to In Search of Lost Time, would prefer to leave it to gather dust on my bookshelves than celebrate it in terms such as these. For the Proust revival belongs to the post-millennial backlash, a fundamental failure of nerve at the beginning of a new era.",

The novel begins with Yasmin, a middle-aged Indian, preparing to return her mother's ashes to the Caribbean island where they both grew up. Yasmin inhabits the suburbs - of Montreal, of the imagination. During the day she works as a television newsreader where she twists her mouth into whatever expression of sadness or wry amusement is appropriate for the video footage being broadcast.

He insisted that dustjackets trivialise the books they cover, but didn't actually read any of the canonical hardbacks with which he lined his study. This belief that books do not need to be decorated mirrored his tendency to muffle emotions, to withhold from his daughter the affectionate display and mad love that all children require. Nor is Yasmin's mother, an anglophiliac snob who eats toast using a knife and fork, any better. </p> <p>In consequence, Yasmin finds it very hard to 'give out', to deal with feeling. Bissoondath has taken a big gamble in centring the novel around such a palpably dislikeable character. Her heart seems to be permafrozen.

These include transmigration, the relationship between memory and history, the extent to which personal identity is a fixed category. It is, in short, a rather typical postcolonial novel. And, as with most typical postcolonial novels, one finishes it feeling slightly better educated, slightly moved, slightly impressed.

      "body": "<p>David Reynolds was 48 when he suffered a major heart attack. Cholesterol build-up in his arteries, lack of exercise, smoking and an inherited susceptibility combined to cause a major disruption to the flow of blood to his heart. The result was cardiac failure. </p> <p>Modern medicine was able to save his life, though Reynolds was left with his heart muscles weakened and his lifestyle constrained. Never the less he has much to be thankful for: a few decades ago he would have been left for dead, such was our knowledge of coronary illness. </p> <p>Yet this dramatic change is nothing compared to the one that will occur in the next 20 years. In the future, the factors that so devastated Reynolds's heart would never have touched his life because they would have been pinpointed years earlier, and action taken to block their effects. </p> <p>This intervention would have come in many forms. His predisposition to high cholesterol build-up would have been spotted by DNA tests and appropriate drugs administered. He would have been warned - starkly and specifically - about his smoking and sedentary ways, and encouraged to take exercise. </p> <p>This is the future of medicine. In the coming decades we will treat illnesses long before their worst effects have had an opportunity to take hold of our bodies. Prevention will be the key factor in saving lives and improving the quality of our existence. </p> <p>It is with this specific aim that the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust are preparing to set up the UK Population Biomedical Collection, a repository of DNA samples, lifestyle data sheets and medical records for half a million middle-aged UK residents. Armed with this information, researchers expect within the next 10 years to be able to tease out the complex, interacting strands of inherited susceptibilities and environmental influences that determine the course of cancers, heart disease and mental illnesses. </p> <p>Scientists have dreamed of unravelling the influences of nature and nurture for centuries. The fact that we are now on the threshold of achieving this goal is due, almost entirely, to the success of researchers who will in the next two years pinpoint every human gene and sequence their structures. </p> <p>Armed with precise details of our genetic make-up, researchers will be able to extract this data from the morass of environmental factors that also influence our wellbeing. We will learn how specific versions of genes are affected by diet, workplace and lifestyle, interactions that are the key to most major illnesses. Do certain foods make some individuals more likely to develop bowel cancer? Is alcohol more likely to trigger liver damage in some people than others? And why does smoking cause lung cancer in some people but not others? </p> <p>It is a dilemma illustrated by the lives of two distinguished Englishmen: Winston Churchill, who drank and smoked to excess but lived beyond 90, and Bobby Moore, a renowned athlete, who succumbed to cancer in his early fifties. One got lucky, one did not - and scientists will soon be able to find out why. </p> <p>More to the point, they will be able to use that knowledge to develop drugs and treatments that will come to the aid of those who have drawn a short straw in the lottery of life. The protein pathways that lead to their susceptibilities will be analysed in detail and chemicals designed to block their effects. In addition, it should be possible to discover why some drugs now in use help some people, but not others. </p> <p>'Consider the example of tamoxifen,' says Medical Research Council chief executive George Radda, one of the masterminds of the DNA collection scheme. 'It can save lives but it is only effective in about 40 per cent of patients. Presumably some women have proteins that break down the drug before it can reach their tumours. If we uncover the identities of those proteins, we should be able to develop drugs that will block their actions and let tomoxifen take effect.' </p> <p>The project has a keen pharmaceutical edge - a point stressed by Professor Tom Meade, chairman of the panel responsible for setting up the DNA collection: 'We are not doing this for idle curiosity. We are setting up this scheme so we can improve the medical treatment of British people. That is our specific aim.' </p> <p>It is undoubtedly a worthy goal. However, some awkward problems have to be dealt with before the scheme can pass its final hurdle of an examination by an NHS committee of ethical inquiry. A principal difficulty concerns access to the data that will flow from studies of the lifestyles and the DNA collected by the project's 500,000 participants - to be stored in mighty mainframe computers at a site that has yet to be selected. </p> <p>This information will be given to pharmaceutical companies and used as the key to the development of future drugs. But the mechanism for passing it on has not yet been worked out. Which companies will be allowed access? Will invaluable data about UK residents be given to foreign drug companies? </p> <p>The Medical Research Council is emphatic that a principal reason for creating the collection is to provide the British drug industry with a powerful advantage over foreign competitors. So health officials will have to pick and choose candidates to whom they will pass on data. </p> <p>And what happens when a drug company uses information from the collection to create a successful drug? How will the profits be divided and passed on? These issues have not yet been worked out. </p> <p>Professor Meade said there was no intention to sell information about British patients to drug companies. 'Never the less, we have got to have some form of financial recompense between ourselves and industry,' he told The Observer . This imprecision makes some observers uneasy. 'We would not be comfortable about information, even anonymous information, about patients being sold to pharmaceutical companies who could turn that data into profits,' said Charlotte Gann of the Consumer Association. </p> <p>Similarly, the question of ensuring that details of medical records, lifestyles and genetic propensities of half a million UK citizens are kept secret also raises concerns. If details of a person's susceptibilities to future illness were passed on to mortgage or insurance companies, or potential employers, the consequences could be very serious. </p> <p>The Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust insist that proper safeguards will be included, but until they are more forthcoming about details pressure groups such as Liberty say they could not back the project. </p> <p>Then there is the issue of ethnic sensitivities. Although human populations differ only slightly in terms of genetic variation, some differences do exist. British people of Asian background tend to suffer heightened risks of heart disease, for example. And if more examples of such sensitivities are uncovered this could be exploited as racist propaganda. 'That is always a possibility,' admits Meade. </p> <p>'However, in discovering such propensities we will have gone a long way to correcting them. In the case of Asian susceptibility to heart disease, if we discover its roots we will be able to tackle the problem with drugs and lifestyle advice. That should reassure ethnic groups.' </p> <p>Of course, it will take at least 10 years before the UK Population Biomedical Collection yields direct results, mainly in the form of new drugs. But in scientific terms, that is a short space of time - and that relative brevity has much to do with the make-up of the collection. </p> <p>Only middle-aged and elderly people will be selected, probably in the 45 to 65 age group. 'These are people who we expect to get ill in the near future,' said Meade. 'That is their real importance.' </p> <p>In other words, there is no point in picking children and young adults for the survey. They will take too long to get sick and die, causing decades-long delays to the development of drugs. </p> <p>For once the older generation has something to offer the future, it seems. </p> <p><strong>So what is a gene?</strong></p> <p><strong> What is a gene?</strong> </p> <p> It is a stretch of DNA inherited from our parents. Genes dictate how our bodies grow and develop. </p> <p> <strong> What does a gene do?</strong> </p> <p> We are made up of thousands of different chemical building blocks called proteins. The manufacture of each protein is controlled by one specific gene. </p> <p> <strong> In what way do genes vary?</strong> </p> <p>Sometimes major mutations occur in a gene so that it no longer manufactures a protein or makes one that does not work properly. The blood condition thalassaemia occurs when a person inherits genes that do not make the protein constituents of haemoglobin. Alternatively a mutation creates a protein that is toxic, as in the case of the fatal brain condition Huntington's chorea. </p> <p> <strong> Is all genetic variation the result of major genetic mutations?</strong> </p> <p> No. Genes have tiny variations from person to person. These are called polymorphisms, and they result in individuals making slightly different versions of the proteins that make up their bodies. </p> <p> <strong> Are these minor variations important?</strong> </p> <p> Yes. One version of a protein may make us more susceptible to heart disease or cancer than another, though they do not cause such diseases. The DNA collection study aims to pinpoint these predisposing proteins and to discover which environmental factors - such as diet - are involvedin mediating their activity. </p> <p> <strong> Can anything be done once a link between a disease and a genetic predisposition has been uncovered?</strong> </p> <p> A person can alter his or her lifestyle. Alternatively, it should be possible to develop drugs that block the protein pathway that leads to the development of that particular disease. This is the ultimate aim of the DNA collection study.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Reynolds was 48 when he suffered a major heart attack. Cholesterol build-up in his arteries, lack of exercise, smoking and an inherited susceptibility combined to cause a major disruption to the flow of blood to his heart. The result was cardiac failure. Modern medicine was able to save his life, though Reynolds was left with his heart muscles weakened and his lifestyle constrained. Never the less he has much to be thankful for: a few decades ago he would have been left for dead, such was our knowledge of coronary illness. Yet this dramatic change is nothing compared to the one that will occur in the next 20 years. In the future, the factors that so devastated Reynolds's heart would never have touched his life because they would have been pinpointed years earlier, and action taken to block their effects. This intervention would have come in many forms. His predisposition to high cholesterol build-up would have been spotted by DNA tests and appropriate drugs administered. He would have been warned - starkly and specifically - about his smoking and sedentary ways, and encouraged to take exercise. This is the future of medicine. In the coming decades we will treat illnesses long before their worst effects have had an opportunity to take hold of our bodies. Prevention will be the key factor in saving lives and improving the quality of our existence. It is with this specific aim that the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust are preparing to set up the UK Population Biomedical Collection, a repository of DNA samples, lifestyle data sheets and medical records for half a million middle-aged UK residents. Armed with this information, researchers expect within the next 10 years to be able to tease out the complex, interacting strands of inherited susceptibilities and environmental influences that determine the course of cancers, heart disease and mental illnesses. Scientists have dreamed of unravelling the influences of nature and nurture for centuries. The fact that we are now on the threshold of achieving this goal is due, almost entirely, to the success of researchers who will in the next two years pinpoint every human gene and sequence their structures. Armed with precise details of our genetic make-up, researchers will be able to extract this data from the morass of environmental factors that also influence our wellbeing. We will learn how specific versions of genes are affected by diet, workplace and lifestyle, interactions that are the key to most major illnesses. Do certain foods make some individuals more likely to develop bowel cancer? Is alcohol more likely to trigger liver damage in some people than others? And why does smoking cause lung cancer in some people but not others? It is a dilemma illustrated by the lives of two distinguished Englishmen: Winston Churchill, who drank and smoked to excess but lived beyond 90, and Bobby Moore, a renowned athlete, who succumbed to cancer in his early fifties. One got lucky, one did not - and scientists will soon be able to find out why. More to the point, they will be able to use that knowledge to develop drugs and treatments that will come to the aid of those who have drawn a short straw in the lottery of life. The protein pathways that lead to their susceptibilities will be analysed in detail and chemicals designed to block their effects. In addition, it should be possible to discover why some drugs now in use help some people, but not others. 'Consider the example of tamoxifen,' says Medical Research Council chief executive George Radda, one of the masterminds of the DNA collection scheme. 'It can save lives but it is only effective in about 40 per cent of patients. Presumably some women have proteins that break down the drug before it can reach their tumours. If we uncover the identities of those proteins, we should be able to develop drugs that will block their actions and let tomoxifen take effect.' The project has a keen pharmaceutical edge - a point stressed by Professor Tom Meade, chairman of the panel responsible for setting up the DNA collection: 'We are not doing this for idle curiosity. We are setting up this scheme so we can improve the medical treatment of British people. That is our specific aim.' It is undoubtedly a worthy goal. However, some awkward problems have to be dealt with before the scheme can pass its final hurdle of an examination by an NHS committee of ethical inquiry. A principal difficulty concerns access to the data that will flow from studies of the lifestyles and the DNA collected by the project's 500,000 participants - to be stored in mighty mainframe computers at a site that has yet to be selected. This information will be given to pharmaceutical companies and used as the key to the development of future drugs. But the mechanism for passing it on has not yet been worked out. Which companies will be allowed access? Will invaluable data about UK residents be given to foreign drug companies? The Medical Research Council is emphatic that a principal reason for creating the collection is to provide the British drug industry with a powerful advantage over foreign competitors. So health officials will have to pick and choose candidates to whom they will pass on data. And what happens when a drug company uses information from the collection to create a successful drug? How will the profits be divided and passed on? These issues have not yet been worked out. Professor Meade said there was no intention to sell information about British patients to drug companies. 'Never the less, we have got to have some form of financial recompense between ourselves and industry,' he told The Observer . This imprecision makes some observers uneasy. 'We would not be comfortable about information, even anonymous information, about patients being sold to pharmaceutical companies who could turn that data into profits,' said Charlotte Gann of the Consumer Association. Similarly, the question of ensuring that details of medical records, lifestyles and genetic propensities of half a million UK citizens are kept secret also raises concerns. If details of a person's susceptibilities to future illness were passed on to mortgage or insurance companies, or potential employers, the consequences could be very serious. The Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust insist that proper safeguards will be included, but until they are more forthcoming about details pressure groups such as Liberty say they could not back the project. Then there is the issue of ethnic sensitivities. Although human populations differ only slightly in terms of genetic variation, some differences do exist. British people of Asian background tend to suffer heightened risks of heart disease, for example. And if more examples of such sensitivities are uncovered this could be exploited as racist propaganda. 'That is always a possibility,' admits Meade. 'However, in discovering such propensities we will have gone a long way to correcting them. In the case of Asian susceptibility to heart disease, if we discover its roots we will be able to tackle the problem with drugs and lifestyle advice. That should reassure ethnic groups.' Of course, it will take at least 10 years before the UK Population Biomedical Collection yields direct results, mainly in the form of new drugs. But in scientific terms, that is a short space of time - and that relative brevity has much to do with the make-up of the collection. Only middle-aged and elderly people will be selected, probably in the 45 to 65 age group. 'These are people who we expect to get ill in the near future,' said Meade. 'That is their real importance.' In other words, there is no point in picking children and young adults for the survey. They will take too long to get sick and die, causing decades-long delays to the development of drugs. For once the older generation has something to offer the future, it seems. So what is a gene? What is a gene? It is a stretch of DNA inherited from our parents. Genes dictate how our bodies grow and develop. What does a gene do? We are made up of thousands of different chemical building blocks called proteins. The manufacture of each protein is controlled by one specific gene. In what way do genes vary? Sometimes major mutations occur in a gene so that it no longer manufactures a protein or makes one that does not work properly. The blood condition thalassaemia occurs when a person inherits genes that do not make the protein constituents of haemoglobin. Alternatively a mutation creates a protein that is toxic, as in the case of the fatal brain condition Huntington's chorea. Is all genetic variation the result of major genetic mutations? No. Genes have tiny variations from person to person. These are called polymorphisms, and they result in individuals making slightly different versions of the proteins that make up their bodies. Are these minor variations important? Yes. One version of a protein may make us more susceptible to heart disease or cancer than another, though they do not cause such diseases. The DNA collection study aims to pinpoint these predisposing proteins and to discover which environmental factors - such as diet - are involvedin mediating their activity. Can anything be done once a link between a disease and a genetic predisposition has been uncovered? A person can alter his or her lifestyle. Alternatively, it should be possible to develop drugs that block the protein pathway that leads to the development of that particular disease. This is the ultimate aim of the DNA collection study.",

They have also expressed satisfaction at a new valuation which suggests that the sale of Richard Rogers' building will net at least \u00a330m - more than twice the original estimate. Gerbeau has already staring hiring new advisers. On Friday the corporate affairs expert Nigel Whittaker was brought in. Whittaker, a regular broadcaster on BBC Radio 4, is a lawyer by training and the former Group Corporate Affairs Director for Kingfisher plc which he co-founded in 1982.",

      "body": "<p>It is an ugly name for an ugly place. Outside Chernokozovo 'filtration camp' relatives wait for news of their menfolk. Inside, according to human rights groups, Russian soldiers are beating, raping and torturing Chechen prisoners.</p> <p>Chernokozovo, with about 700 detainees, is the largest of four camps in which the Russians are 'separating' terrorists from civilians. Many of the men have been summarily arrested on the flimsiest of pretexts.</p> <p>The camp, a former Soviet factory 30 miles north of Grozny, has been thrown together from red brick and barbed wire. The factory's tall water coolers have been converted into watchtowers; high walls make it impossible to see what is happening inside.</p> <p>News from behind the huge sliding doors is scarce. Relatives of those detained wait in the nearby market place for scraps of informa tion brought out by locals employed in the prison.</p> <p>Magomadovo Umarovna was yesterday waiting by the gate holding five garlic heads which she hoped to be able to pass to her detained son, Adlan Basayev. The orderly who serves food to the inmates had managed to smuggle out a note from him, begging her to send some kind of medicine to protect against tuberculosis.</p> <p>In detention since 13 January, her son's only crime was to have the same surname as the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev. 'They checked his papers and decided he must be a relative. Why should he suffer because of his surname? None of us have ever even set eyes on Basayev. The system is very cruel,' she said.</p> <p>'He wrote that there was a TB epidemic inside. I can't get the right tablets to send him. I hope the garlic may help.' His note had given few details of life within the camp. 'They're scared to write much, in case the letter goes astray. But I know things are bad for him there. Someone who was recently freed told me my son's nose was broken when he was beaten in the toilets.'</p> <p>This is the detention centre where Russian war correspondent Andrei Babitsky - arrested for reporting from Grozny without military permission - was allegedly held by the Russian security services, before being handed over to Chechen fighters last week in a prisoner swap. He is thought to have been badly treated during his stay. On Friday a funeral was held in Chernokozovo for another inmate who died after being beaten. 'Sometimes at night people living near the prison say they can hear the noise of people being tortured,' Umarovna said.</p> <p>Last week a letter detailing the brutality of the camp regime, apparently written by a Russian soldier there, was leaked to the media. He described how Chechen inmates were being systematically beaten, raped and killed. He said that Babitsky 'was beaten so badly that his glasses were flung in the air, poor guy'. The soldier expressed his sense of guilt at his participation in the brutality.</p> <p>Human rights organisations have also expressed concern at the conditions within these centres, set up with the aim of filtering out fighters from civilians.

      "bodyText": "It is an ugly name for an ugly place. Outside Chernokozovo 'filtration camp' relatives wait for news of their menfolk. Inside, according to human rights groups, Russian soldiers are beating, raping and torturing Chechen prisoners. Chernokozovo, with about 700 detainees, is the largest of four camps in which the Russians are 'separating' terrorists from civilians. Many of the men have been summarily arrested on the flimsiest of pretexts. The camp, a former Soviet factory 30 miles north of Grozny, has been thrown together from red brick and barbed wire. The factory's tall water coolers have been converted into watchtowers; high walls make it impossible to see what is happening inside. News from behind the huge sliding doors is scarce. Relatives of those detained wait in the nearby market place for scraps of informa tion brought out by locals employed in the prison. Magomadovo Umarovna was yesterday waiting by the gate holding five garlic heads which she hoped to be able to pass to her detained son, Adlan Basayev. The orderly who serves food to the inmates had managed to smuggle out a note from him, begging her to send some kind of medicine to protect against tuberculosis. In detention since 13 January, her son's only crime was to have the same surname as the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev. 'They checked his papers and decided he must be a relative. Why should he suffer because of his surname? None of us have ever even set eyes on Basayev. The system is very cruel,' she said. 'He wrote that there was a TB epidemic inside. I can't get the right tablets to send him. I hope the garlic may help.' His note had given few details of life within the camp. 'They're scared to write much, in case the letter goes astray. But I know things are bad for him there. Someone who was recently freed told me my son's nose was broken when he was beaten in the toilets.' This is the detention centre where Russian war correspondent Andrei Babitsky - arrested for reporting from Grozny without military permission - was allegedly held by the Russian security services, before being handed over to Chechen fighters last week in a prisoner swap. He is thought to have been badly treated during his stay. On Friday a funeral was held in Chernokozovo for another inmate who died after being beaten. 'Sometimes at night people living near the prison say they can hear the noise of people being tortured,' Umarovna said. Last week a letter detailing the brutality of the camp regime, apparently written by a Russian soldier there, was leaked to the media. He described how Chechen inmates were being systematically beaten, raped and killed. He said that Babitsky 'was beaten so badly that his glasses were flung in the air, poor guy'. The soldier expressed his sense of guilt at his participation in the brutality. Human rights organisations have also expressed concern at the conditions within these centres, set up with the aim of filtering out fighters from civilians. There is evidence that large numbers of young Chechen men are being rounded up arbitrarily and detained. Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's representative in the region, said: 'These men are being taken to unknown detention facilities and their families are not being informed of where they are. Some men are never heard of again. Given the massive abuses that took place in these centres during the last war, we are gravely concerned about this developing trend.'

      "body": "<p>The future of the resumed Middle East peace process hung by a thread this weekend after Israel, the regional superpower humiliated in Israeli-occupied south Lebanon by just a few hundred guerrillas, promised 'very painful' reprisals against the whole of Syrian-controlled Lebanon.</p> <p>The possibility of the 30,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon being drawn into the conflict in the absence of a settlement grew after both Israel and the United States accused Syria of failing to restrain the Hizbollah fighters who have killed seven Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon in 18 days.</p> <p>As Hizbollah ordered an alert in the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, in anticipation of an Israeli strike, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Selim Hoss, called on Washington to 'prevent' Israel from attacking civilian targets. His appeal followed a night of air raids last week that targeted power plants in northern, eastern and central Lebanon. The attacks wounded 17 civilians, caused damage estimated at $50 million and plunged much of the country into darkness.</p> <p>Human rights monitors said Israel's reprisals, a tacit admission of its inability to defeat Hizbollah on the battlefield, violated the Geneva Convention's ban on collective penalties.</p> <p>But the Israeli government, struggling to fulfil an election pledge to extricate its army from south Lebanon within five months, accused Hizbollah last week of violating the separate, so-called April Understanding - the American-brokered rules of war agreed to protect civilian life in the wake of an Israeli shelling that killed 105 Lebanese villagers in a United Nations shelter almost four years ago. The Israelis made it clear that they now consider the understanding a dead letter.</p> <p>Emboldened by Washington's refusal to criticise the blitz against Lebanon's national grid, and by its insistence on blaming Hizbollah alone for the growing crisis, Israeli officials said future attacks on their army of occupation would pave the way for new attacks on Lebanon's civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>The Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, said on Friday: 'We shall respond when and how we want with very painful strikes against Lebanese territory.'</p> <p>Barak was speaking after the Israeli delegation had walked out of an emergency meeting of the group monitoring the April Understanding - seen by many as the last hope of containing the violence.</p> <p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy had warned earlier that 'the soil of Lebanon will burn' if Hizbollah fired across the border.</p> <p>Under the understanding, Israel and Hizbollah are permitted to attack each other's forces inside south Lebanon but may not target civilians or fire across the border. Israel claims Hizbollah has violated the agreement by launching attacks from Lebanese villages.</p> <p>Hizbollah insists it is honouring the understanding. It says only Israel is causing civilian casualties; that not a single civilian has been harmed in the attacks in which its own fighters have killed six members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia this year in addition to the seven members of the Israeli forces.</p> <p>Concern about Israel's intentions in Lebanon grew after its delegation failed to join the representatives of the United States, France, Syria and Lebanon meeting in the southern town of Naqoura on Friday to try to save the agreement. Israel claimed it withdrew after Hizbollah killed another soldier just inside Israel's 'security zone'.

      "bodyText": "The future of the resumed Middle East peace process hung by a thread this weekend after Israel, the regional superpower humiliated in Israeli-occupied south Lebanon by just a few hundred guerrillas, promised 'very painful' reprisals against the whole of Syrian-controlled Lebanon. The possibility of the 30,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon being drawn into the conflict in the absence of a settlement grew after both Israel and the United States accused Syria of failing to restrain the Hizbollah fighters who have killed seven Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon in 18 days. As Hizbollah ordered an alert in the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, in anticipation of an Israeli strike, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Selim Hoss, called on Washington to 'prevent' Israel from attacking civilian targets. His appeal followed a night of air raids last week that targeted power plants in northern, eastern and central Lebanon. The attacks wounded 17 civilians, caused damage estimated at $50 million and plunged much of the country into darkness. Human rights monitors said Israel's reprisals, a tacit admission of its inability to defeat Hizbollah on the battlefield, violated the Geneva Convention's ban on collective penalties. But the Israeli government, struggling to fulfil an election pledge to extricate its army from south Lebanon within five months, accused Hizbollah last week of violating the separate, so-called April Understanding - the American-brokered rules of war agreed to protect civilian life in the wake of an Israeli shelling that killed 105 Lebanese villagers in a United Nations shelter almost four years ago. The Israelis made it clear that they now consider the understanding a dead letter. Emboldened by Washington's refusal to criticise the blitz against Lebanon's national grid, and by its insistence on blaming Hizbollah alone for the growing crisis, Israeli officials said future attacks on their army of occupation would pave the way for new attacks on Lebanon's civilian infrastructure. The Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, said on Friday: 'We shall respond when and how we want with very painful strikes against Lebanese territory.' Barak was speaking after the Israeli delegation had walked out of an emergency meeting of the group monitoring the April Understanding - seen by many as the last hope of containing the violence. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy had warned earlier that 'the soil of Lebanon will burn' if Hizbollah fired across the border. Under the understanding, Israel and Hizbollah are permitted to attack each other's forces inside south Lebanon but may not target civilians or fire across the border. Israel claims Hizbollah has violated the agreement by launching attacks from Lebanese villages. Hizbollah insists it is honouring the understanding. It says only Israel is causing civilian casualties; that not a single civilian has been harmed in the attacks in which its own fighters have killed six members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia this year in addition to the seven members of the Israeli forces. Concern about Israel's intentions in Lebanon grew after its delegation failed to join the representatives of the United States, France, Syria and Lebanon meeting in the southern town of Naqoura on Friday to try to save the agreement. Israel claimed it withdrew after Hizbollah killed another soldier just inside Israel's 'security zone'. Other delegates said the boycott was planned all along. Hopes of saving Lebanon from another round of bloodshed far greater than the last now hang on a resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks that began again in December after a four-year hiatus. The talks, in Shepherdstown, Virginia, were suspended on 3 January after a leaked document showed that Israel was planning not a 'withdrawal' from the occupied Golan Heights - Syria's price for peace in south Lebanon - but a 'redeployment' that could leave 17,000 Israelis settled on Syrian soil. Unable to defeat Hizbollah militarily or diplomatically, Barak now seems set on blasting his way out of south Lebanon if he cannot leave by agreement with Syria. As Israeli jets carried out a 'routine' bombing, Sabah Safieddine angrily gestured to her daughter's bed in their home in the port of Tyre, badly damaged by Israeli rockets last Tuesday. Six-year-old Nahla would have been badly wounded had she not been out when the rockets pierced it with thick spears of glass, said her mother. 'Israel shoots at children. Hizbollah only shoots at soldiers. This is our land. Israel will never leave of its own accord. We have to punch them out.'",

But within seconds he abandoned the reading room for the nineteenth hole and grabbed a large G and T to wave at the audience. The universities were to blame for Ministerial contempt, he continued. They were not addressing issues which were 'relevant' to politicians. 'Perverse' researchers 'driven by ideology' failed to take into account the 'reality of many people's lives'. Wary commentators detected the faint, ripe whiff of the banana republic. It is not the business of a politician in a free society to order researchers, or anyone else for that matter, to think what the state wants them to think and deride as 'ideological' those who find uncomfortable facts, just because they can't quite see the splendour of the Third Way. Blunkett was duly condemned in the Times Higher Education Supplement.</p> <p>What was striking was that his audience, who might have been expected to be unsettled by Blunkett's bullying, did not join its defence of intellectual freedom.

Would it have made a difference to civil servants and journalists who consumed its findings if the following declaration had been added? 'We acknowledge that Keith Brandon, Chief Executive Officer of Tesco, is a member of our governing body. Our \"Eating Food and Health Link Management Committee\" has found seats for representatives of Nestl\u00e9, Sainsbury's and Kellogg. Indeed, the food industry has a loud voice in our senior appointments. Lord Sainsbury, the unelected Minister for Science, who is working hard to undermine the public's rejection of GM food, appointed our latest council members.

I was not, I assured her, suggesting that Dr Harvey had altered his findings to suit fat cats. (They are far more critical than the press coverage and the council's journal suggested. He told me he was 'astonished by the positive spin' put on his work.) She assured me in turn that rigorous peer review maintained the highest standards and was shocked when I said Labour MPs had noticed that the council seemed to be remarkably close to the big corporations and were threatening to raise the matter in Parliament. The danger they see was exemplified by her baffled response. It is not that this or that piece of research is biased.

Far from condemning a planning system that allows supermarkets to appeal when an application for an out-of-town store is rejected, but offers no similar rights to local protesters when it is accepted, the management consultants said the rules were too harsh and must be relaxed.

But the aristocracy did not get where it is by being paternalistic, and His Grace promised his land to Safeways and put it in a position to close its town-centre store and knock out small shopkeepers who relied on passing trade. John Prescott, quite rightly, refused to let building go ahead. Safeways sued the council. Last week the tiny local authority's insurers reached a settlement with the conglomerate and the Duke and agreed to hand over \u00a32.6m compensation.

      "body": "<p>As pre-election pledges go, it was crystal clear. Tony Blair, the would-be Prime Minister, promised to stop the Tories' scandalous sale of playing fields. Labour's promise to protect our sporting heritage was unequivocal. 'We will end the policy of selling playing fields,' thundered its manifesto for sport.</p> <p>Three years on, scores of sports fields are still being sold for housing, car parks and supermarkets. Labour stands accused of breaking its promise - and fiddling the figures to cover up its failure.</p> <p>Ministers boast they have 'virtually halted' the sale of playing fields through 'tough measures'. But an Observer investigation shows this is untrue and that the new measures have made little difference. Inquiries revealed that:</p> <p>* Hundreds of playing fields have disappeared during Labour's time in office.</p> <p>* More than 100 school playing fields have gone in the past 15 months alone.</p> <p>* Pupils are being deprived of access to recreational facilities because schools are selling valuable sports sites to build new classrooms.</p> <p>* Two Cabinet Ministers have been given special power to prevent sell-offs - but have saved just four playing fields from developers.</p> <p>* Objections to proposed sales raised by the official watchdog for playing fields are being overruled.</p> <p>* The Government is ignoring a growing clamour from bodies such as the Football Association and Rugby Football Union for sell-offs to be halted immediately.</p> <p>* Ministers are hugely embarrassed by the continuing disappearance of recreational green spaces, but admit the sales raise hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>Criticism of the Government's performance is rising. The Central Council of Physical Recreation, which represents the governing bodies of sports such as football, cricket and tennis, condemns it as 'a disgrace'. 'We were led to believe they would stop the sale of playing fields - after all, that's what they said they would do in their manifesto - and they haven't,' says spokesman Nigel Hook.</p> <p>The National Playing Fields Association is equally blunt. 'The Government's record is pretty abysmal,' claimed director Elsa Davies. 'I'm an ex-teacher, and if I was marking their performance on playing fields, I would give them just two out of ten.'</p> <p>Since May 1997, Labour has introduced a number of measures which it claimed would make selling playing fields difficult. John Prescott, the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions, and David Blunkett, his opposite number at Education and Employment, were handed new powers to veto 'unnecessary' sales.</p> <p>Prescott can stop a sell-off if Sport England, formerly the English Sports Council, which by law has to be consulted about proposed sales in England, has objected to it but the local council has decided to approve it anyway. While 17 such cases have been referred to him since December 1998, he has 'called in' just one - later withdrawn - overruled the sports council's advice on 10 others and is 'still considering' another six.</p> <p>In another change from the Tories' time in power, any school in England wanting to sell a playing field now has to first obtain Blunkett's permission and must satisfy 'tough, rigorous new criteria'. But in the 15 months to the end of 1999, Blunkett rejected just two of 103 proposals.</p> <p>Critics agree Labour's stipulation that money raised from a sale now has to be ploughed back into sport or education is a step forward. But Davies points out that, while schools are no longer forced to dispose of playing fields, schools needing cash to build classrooms find this ring-fencing offers them incentive to do just that. In Croydon, for example, the local council intends to sell playing fields attached to Haling Manor School in order to pay for expanding the school.</p> <p>One local Labour councillor claims that the plan could 'open the floodgates' to the disappearance of other school playing fields.</p> <p>Unpublished figures collected by the sports council show that, in the past four months of 1999 alone, it was consulted about 236 proposed sell-offs.</p> <p>Blunkett has decided to reconsider one of his previous rejections, the proposed construction of 96 houses on Foster's Field, a nine-acre playing field in the middle of the Dorset town of Sherborne.</p> <p>'Dorset County Council propose to spend \u00a31 million of the \u00a34m they'll get from selling Foster's Field into replacement pitches a mile and a half away,' says local campaigner Douglas Hosking.

      "bodyText": "As pre-election pledges go, it was crystal clear. Tony Blair, the would-be Prime Minister, promised to stop the Tories' scandalous sale of playing fields. Labour's promise to protect our sporting heritage was unequivocal. 'We will end the policy of selling playing fields,' thundered its manifesto for sport. Three years on, scores of sports fields are still being sold for housing, car parks and supermarkets. Labour stands accused of breaking its promise - and fiddling the figures to cover up its failure. Ministers boast they have 'virtually halted' the sale of playing fields through 'tough measures'. But an Observer investigation shows this is untrue and that the new measures have made little difference. Inquiries revealed that: * Hundreds of playing fields have disappeared during Labour's time in office. * More than 100 school playing fields have gone in the past 15 months alone. * Pupils are being deprived of access to recreational facilities because schools are selling valuable sports sites to build new classrooms. * Two Cabinet Ministers have been given special power to prevent sell-offs - but have saved just four playing fields from developers. * Objections to proposed sales raised by the official watchdog for playing fields are being overruled. * The Government is ignoring a growing clamour from bodies such as the Football Association and Rugby Football Union for sell-offs to be halted immediately. * Ministers are hugely embarrassed by the continuing disappearance of recreational green spaces, but admit the sales raise hundreds of millions of pounds. Criticism of the Government's performance is rising. The Central Council of Physical Recreation, which represents the governing bodies of sports such as football, cricket and tennis, condemns it as 'a disgrace'. 'We were led to believe they would stop the sale of playing fields - after all, that's what they said they would do in their manifesto - and they haven't,' says spokesman Nigel Hook. The National Playing Fields Association is equally blunt. 'The Government's record is pretty abysmal,' claimed director Elsa Davies. 'I'm an ex-teacher, and if I was marking their performance on playing fields, I would give them just two out of ten.' Since May 1997, Labour has introduced a number of measures which it claimed would make selling playing fields difficult. John Prescott, the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions, and David Blunkett, his opposite number at Education and Employment, were handed new powers to veto 'unnecessary' sales. Prescott can stop a sell-off if Sport England, formerly the English Sports Council, which by law has to be consulted about proposed sales in England, has objected to it but the local council has decided to approve it anyway. While 17 such cases have been referred to him since December 1998, he has 'called in' just one - later withdrawn - overruled the sports council's advice on 10 others and is 'still considering' another six. In another change from the Tories' time in power, any school in England wanting to sell a playing field now has to first obtain Blunkett's permission and must satisfy 'tough, rigorous new criteria'. But in the 15 months to the end of 1999, Blunkett rejected just two of 103 proposals. Critics agree Labour's stipulation that money raised from a sale now has to be ploughed back into sport or education is a step forward. But Davies points out that, while schools are no longer forced to dispose of playing fields, schools needing cash to build classrooms find this ring-fencing offers them incentive to do just that. In Croydon, for example, the local council intends to sell playing fields attached to Haling Manor School in order to pay for expanding the school. One local Labour councillor claims that the plan could 'open the floodgates' to the disappearance of other school playing fields. Unpublished figures collected by the sports council show that, in the past four months of 1999 alone, it was consulted about 236 proposed sell-offs. Blunkett has decided to reconsider one of his previous rejections, the proposed construction of 96 houses on Foster's Field, a nine-acre playing field in the middle of the Dorset town of Sherborne. 'Dorset County Council propose to spend \u00a31 million of the \u00a34m they'll get from selling Foster's Field into replacement pitches a mile and a half away,' says local campaigner Douglas Hosking. 'But why should the last piece of green space in Sherborne be sold to benefit education elsewhere in Dorset? That should be paid for out of central government funds.' An sports council document passed to The Observer predicts that, given pressure on land for house-building, sell-offs will continue. In some areas, it says, 'the needs of current and future generations for playing fields will never be met'. The watchdog is frustrated that, although it can object to developments, it cannot actually thwart them. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

The final call was made less than 24 hours before Michael quit to avoid being publicly sacked.</p> <p>Blair warned him that the whole devolution process - which Labour and the Liberal Democrats supported against Tory opposition - could be undermined if Michael were brought down.</p> <p>But Kennedy, who visited Cardiff yesterday to speak in memory of Lloyd George, retorted that devolution implied that decisions such as the choice of a First Secretary had to be made locally.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the popular Rhodri Morgan will be voted into office to succeed Michael. All three opposition parties have signalled that they will back his appointment, which many politicians see as the start of a new era in Welsh politics. Plaid Cymru Assembly member Phil Williams claimed: 'In the streets of Wales there is a feeling that our man is in now.'</p> <p>He said Morgan's election would be welcomed by nationalists, despite the risk that they will suffer in the polls if Labour is led by a local leader with a popular touch.</p> <p>Morgan is expected to hold talks with other parties about the possibility of informal co-operation around a jointly agreed political programme, but he is unlikely to offer them any Cabinet seats.</p> <p>He needs to build bridges with a minority in the Welsh Labour leadership who stayed loyal to Michael to the bitter end. By the time he was forced from office last Wednesday, Michael could count on the backing of only five of his 27 fellow Labour assembly members. Three have since resigned their positions as party whips, accusing the chief whip Andrew Davies of having plotted against Michael.</p> <p>His defeat is expected to harden opinion in the national Labour Party against using complicated electoral colleges to choose candidates for the leadership of the Scottish and Welsh assemblies or for city mayors.</p> <p>In the original contest between Michael and Morgan for the top Welsh post, Morgan won the higher number of votes, but Michael was elected because he had more support from MPs and union leaders using the block vote.</p> <p>Labour General Secretary Margaret McDonagh has accepted that the use of an electoral college in Wales and in the London mayoralty contest has provoked a backlash.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair pleaded with the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy to save the career of his man in Wales, Alun Michael, it emerged yesterday. The Prime Minister telephoned Kennedy 'several times' hoping to persuade the Liberal Democrats to withdraw their support from the 'no confidence' motion in the Welsh Assembly that forced Michael out of office last week. The final call was made less than 24 hours before Michael quit to avoid being publicly sacked. Blair warned him that the whole devolution process - which Labour and the Liberal Democrats supported against Tory opposition - could be undermined if Michael were brought down. But Kennedy, who visited Cardiff yesterday to speak in memory of Lloyd George, retorted that devolution implied that decisions such as the choice of a First Secretary had to be made locally. On Tuesday, the popular Rhodri Morgan will be voted into office to succeed Michael. All three opposition parties have signalled that they will back his appointment, which many politicians see as the start of a new era in Welsh politics. Plaid Cymru Assembly member Phil Williams claimed: 'In the streets of Wales there is a feeling that our man is in now.' He said Morgan's election would be welcomed by nationalists, despite the risk that they will suffer in the polls if Labour is led by a local leader with a popular touch. Morgan is expected to hold talks with other parties about the possibility of informal co-operation around a jointly agreed political programme, but he is unlikely to offer them any Cabinet seats. He needs to build bridges with a minority in the Welsh Labour leadership who stayed loyal to Michael to the bitter end. By the time he was forced from office last Wednesday, Michael could count on the backing of only five of his 27 fellow Labour assembly members. Three have since resigned their positions as party whips, accusing the chief whip Andrew Davies of having plotted against Michael. His defeat is expected to harden opinion in the national Labour Party against using complicated electoral colleges to choose candidates for the leadership of the Scottish and Welsh assemblies or for city mayors. In the original contest between Michael and Morgan for the top Welsh post, Morgan won the higher number of votes, but Michael was elected because he had more support from MPs and union leaders using the block vote. Labour General Secretary Margaret McDonagh has accepted that the use of an electoral college in Wales and in the London mayoralty contest has provoked a backlash.",

      "bodyText": "Relatives of General Augusto Pinochet were reported to be rushing to his bedside yesterday after claims that his health had seriously deteriorated. But his supporters were accused of fabricating the crisis, said to involve a severe bout of depression, in order to put pressure on the British courts to release the 84-year-old former dictator. They are anxious to get Pinochet freed before 11 March, when the incumbent Christian Democrat President Eduardo Frei will hand over power to his socialist successor, Ricardo Lagos, who was jailed under the former dictator. Monica Werhahn, of the Pinochet Foundation in Santiago, said family members were breaking off their holidays to take the first available flights to Britain after a 'serious and worrisome' deterioration in the former dictator's health. Luis Cortes Villa, head of the foundation - which hands out military scholarships and promotes the General's public image - told Chilean radio yesterday: 'He does not get out of bed, he hardly talks with anyone... and it has left his entire family worried.' But a Home Office spokesman said: 'We have checked these reports out and they appear to be pure speculation.' A spokeswoman for the Chilean Committe for Justice in London suggested the reports were fuelled by the Pinochet camp's disappointment over last week's court ruling which has prolonged his stay in Britain. The latest legal argument thrown up by Spain's request to extradite the former dictator is over whether a medical report drawn up last month should be published. The report prompted Home Secretary Jack Straw's announcment he was 'minded' to allow Pinochet to return to Chile. Last week the courts unexpectedly ruled that the issue could go to a judicial review, which is likely to be taken all the way to the law lords for a final decision.",

      "body": "<p>It looked like the work of teenage vandals. When fire fighters arrived at the disused butcher's shop in Windemere Avenue, Wembley, north west London, they found an armchair ablaze in the old cold storage room.</p> <p>But once the flames were doused the sickening truth was revealed: a person had been tied to the chair before it had been set alight. The body was burned beyond recognition; intense heat had melted parts of the face. It was impossible to tell whether the victim was young or old, male or female, black or white.</p> <p>A post mortem examination revealed it was a young man. He had been severely beaten: two front teeth were kicked out, there were bruises all over his face and apparent restraining marks on his wrists. He had choked to death on his own vomit before being torched.</p> <p>Police managed to take fingerprints from one hand. The victim was identified as 28-year-old William Senyanga, a Ugandan asylum seeker.</p> <p>Senyanga, who arrived in London in March 1991, had told immigration officials that his father, a prominent political activist, had been murdered by an outlawed rebel faction. His only contact with the police had been an arrest for driving while disqualified. He seemed the unlikely recipient of such a brutal end.</p> <p>But detectives found the death threw open a secret world of escort agencies, vicious rivalries, brutal exploitation and enormous sums of money being made. In London, the trade is estimated to be worth \u00a3200 million a year. Next week, after a year-long probe into the seedy world of vice and call girls, the killers will finally be sentenced.</p> <p>The story began in late 1996, when Senyanga moved into a council flat in the plush Pimlico area of central London. Once there, he set up several escort agencies supplying prostitutes to a wide range of clients. All business was conducted on the phone. He recruited girls and sought clients through advertisements in free newspapers. His flat had six telephones. Senyanga would answer each one with a different company name: Ambassadors, 18 &amp; New, Girls-R-Us and so on. He had more than 60 women on his books and they charged clients a minimum \u00a3150 per hour. Senyanga would take a third and the girl the rest. Clients were able to pay with credit cards.

      "bodyText": "It looked like the work of teenage vandals. When fire fighters arrived at the disused butcher's shop in Windemere Avenue, Wembley, north west London, they found an armchair ablaze in the old cold storage room. But once the flames were doused the sickening truth was revealed: a person had been tied to the chair before it had been set alight. The body was burned beyond recognition; intense heat had melted parts of the face. It was impossible to tell whether the victim was young or old, male or female, black or white. A post mortem examination revealed it was a young man. He had been severely beaten: two front teeth were kicked out, there were bruises all over his face and apparent restraining marks on his wrists. He had choked to death on his own vomit before being torched. Police managed to take fingerprints from one hand. The victim was identified as 28-year-old William Senyanga, a Ugandan asylum seeker. Senyanga, who arrived in London in March 1991, had told immigration officials that his father, a prominent political activist, had been murdered by an outlawed rebel faction. His only contact with the police had been an arrest for driving while disqualified. He seemed the unlikely recipient of such a brutal end. But detectives found the death threw open a secret world of escort agencies, vicious rivalries, brutal exploitation and enormous sums of money being made. In London, the trade is estimated to be worth \u00a3200 million a year. Next week, after a year-long probe into the seedy world of vice and call girls, the killers will finally be sentenced. The story began in late 1996, when Senyanga moved into a council flat in the plush Pimlico area of central London. Once there, he set up several escort agencies supplying prostitutes to a wide range of clients. All business was conducted on the phone. He recruited girls and sought clients through advertisements in free newspapers. His flat had six telephones. Senyanga would answer each one with a different company name: Ambassadors, 18 &amp; New, Girls-R-Us and so on. He had more than 60 women on his books and they charged clients a minimum \u00a3150 per hour. Senyanga would take a third and the girl the rest. Clients were able to pay with credit cards. Working 6pm to 6am seven days a week, Senyanga was soon raking in more than \u00a35,000 a week. Detective Inspector Chris Foster, the man leading the investigation, realised that Senyanga's business dealings held the key to his death. A search of the Pimlico house revealed that the agency boss kept meticulous records of all girls working for him and Foster began to contact them. They also found a scrap of paper in his waste basket with 'Room 22, Wembley Hotel' written on it. But the hotel's register showed that room was not used the weekend Senyanga died. As prostitutes began to talk, it seemed Senyanga had been a fairly popular employer, hiring drivers for his girls and insisting they call before and after each visit to confirm they were safe. But he had enemies too. As few of the girls had met him in person, he would often anonymously pose as a client and 'test' them, revealing the truth later. There were doubts about his fairness with their money. One girl, Alison, told detectives she started working for Senyanga in December 1997. The 21-year-old university student had run up massive debts in her final year and, ashamed to ask her well-to-do accountant father for help, turned to prostitution. One night she was sent to a regular client, a well-known art critic who paid her \u00a32,000, by credit card to spend the night with him. When Alison tried to get her money, Senyanga told her the transaction had not gone through. Alison continued working for Senyanga, but felt increasingly bitter towards him. Foster called the last few numbers that had been dialled on the six phones. Most belonged to prostitutes employed by Senyanga. 'One time a man answered and I explained who I was,' he says. 'There was a pause then he told me that his name was Michael and that he couldn't talk at that point because he was in a wine bar with friends.

      "body": "<p>'I refuse to hand over St Patrick to the Roman Catholic Church, or to the embrace of the Pope and the IRA.' The Rev Ian Paisley was in vintage form at Stormont on Monday. The DUP leader was speaking in one of the last debates in the now suspended assembly, supporting a call for St Patrick's Day to be made a public holiday in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The motion was proposed by Kieran McCarthy of the Alliance Party, who believes it is high time for the people of Northern Ireland to share in the celebrations which take place in Dublin and New York and other cities across the world.</p> <p>At the moment, 17 March is a bank holiday in the Province, but the fact that it is not an official public holiday means that the labouring classes 'simply have to plod on'.</p> <p>Not all of Paisley's supporters shared his enthusiasm for celebrating Ireland's patron saint. Sammy Wilson of the DUP argued that 'no self-respecting Protestant would take part in a St Patrick's Day parade'. But the mood of the debate was good-humoured and the assembly voted overwhelmingly for the motion, and for an amendment that the Union Flag should be flown from public buildings on 17 March. It seemed an ecumenical compromise, reconciling the symbols of both traditions and thus thoroughly worthy of the hopes which were vested, for 72 days, in the new assembly.</p> <p>There have been other signals of the unionist community's desire to reclaim St Patrick as a patron saint for both sides. In Derry last week, the Apprentice Boys, closely identified with unionist history, announced a programme of events for St Patrick's Day weekend.</p> <p>Alistair Simpson, the governor of the Apprentice Boys, explained: 'Our aim is to reverse the Protestant community's increasing alienation from the national saint, by providing something which Protestants can feel part of and proud of.'</p> <p>Not all of the celebrations for St Patrick's Day are so harmonious. In Belfast, the city council has refused to fund the carnival which takes place annually in West Belfast, on the ground that it represents only one section of the community.</p> <p>The problems of marking St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland are rooted in the old historic quarrel. Now many people want to leave this behind and have a holiday which both communities can share. At least they are not part of the kind of prejudice which mars the St Patrick's Day parade in New York.</p> <p>For the past 10 years the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organisation, a group based in New York, has been fighting for the right to march, under its own banner. The route takes it up Fifth Avenue, where the marchers stop in front of St Patrick's Cathedral and are blessed by Cardinal O'Connor.</p> <p>The organisers have always refused to allow the Irish gays to march, on the ground that this is a private occasion where they have the right to exclude groups and individuals of whom they do not approve. This has led to ugly confrontations between the New York Police Department (another traditional Irish American stronghold) and members of ILGO.</p> <p>The row has added piquancy this year because Hillary Clinton has been invited to lead the St Patrick's parade. This has been widely seen as a tribute to the Clintons' support for the Northern Ireland peace process.</p> <p>In recent years, the traditional Irish American community in New York has dispersed. But the Irish vote is still important to any Democratic candidate. A refusal by Mrs Clinton to take part in the parade would be interpreted as a snub.</p> <p>There is also the gay vote to be considered. The Democratic candidate for the Senate will not want to offend gay sensibilities.</p> <p>At last week's assembly debate at Stormont, one of the speakers expressed the hope that St Patrick could be a positive influence, allowing Irish people to celebrate their diversity. Maybe, some time in the future. There is a legend that on the Last Day, St Patrick will lead all the souls of Ireland to God's judgment seat.</p> <p>They will include unionist and republican, Catholic and Protestant, gay and straight. The argument over decommissioning will be finally laid to rest, and there will be no flags.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'I refuse to hand over St Patrick to the Roman Catholic Church, or to the embrace of the Pope and the IRA.' The Rev Ian Paisley was in vintage form at Stormont on Monday. The DUP leader was speaking in one of the last debates in the now suspended assembly, supporting a call for St Patrick's Day to be made a public holiday in Northern Ireland. The motion was proposed by Kieran McCarthy of the Alliance Party, who believes it is high time for the people of Northern Ireland to share in the celebrations which take place in Dublin and New York and other cities across the world. At the moment, 17 March is a bank holiday in the Province, but the fact that it is not an official public holiday means that the labouring classes 'simply have to plod on'. Not all of Paisley's supporters shared his enthusiasm for celebrating Ireland's patron saint. Sammy Wilson of the DUP argued that 'no self-respecting Protestant would take part in a St Patrick's Day parade'. But the mood of the debate was good-humoured and the assembly voted overwhelmingly for the motion, and for an amendment that the Union Flag should be flown from public buildings on 17 March. It seemed an ecumenical compromise, reconciling the symbols of both traditions and thus thoroughly worthy of the hopes which were vested, for 72 days, in the new assembly. There have been other signals of the unionist community's desire to reclaim St Patrick as a patron saint for both sides. In Derry last week, the Apprentice Boys, closely identified with unionist history, announced a programme of events for St Patrick's Day weekend. Alistair Simpson, the governor of the Apprentice Boys, explained: 'Our aim is to reverse the Protestant community's increasing alienation from the national saint, by providing something which Protestants can feel part of and proud of.' Not all of the celebrations for St Patrick's Day are so harmonious. In Belfast, the city council has refused to fund the carnival which takes place annually in West Belfast, on the ground that it represents only one section of the community. The problems of marking St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland are rooted in the old historic quarrel. Now many people want to leave this behind and have a holiday which both communities can share. At least they are not part of the kind of prejudice which mars the St Patrick's Day parade in New York. For the past 10 years the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organisation, a group based in New York, has been fighting for the right to march, under its own banner. The route takes it up Fifth Avenue, where the marchers stop in front of St Patrick's Cathedral and are blessed by Cardinal O'Connor. The organisers have always refused to allow the Irish gays to march, on the ground that this is a private occasion where they have the right to exclude groups and individuals of whom they do not approve. This has led to ugly confrontations between the New York Police Department (another traditional Irish American stronghold) and members of ILGO. The row has added piquancy this year because Hillary Clinton has been invited to lead the St Patrick's parade. This has been widely seen as a tribute to the Clintons' support for the Northern Ireland peace process. In recent years, the traditional Irish American community in New York has dispersed. But the Irish vote is still important to any Democratic candidate. A refusal by Mrs Clinton to take part in the parade would be interpreted as a snub. There is also the gay vote to be considered. The Democratic candidate for the Senate will not want to offend gay sensibilities. At last week's assembly debate at Stormont, one of the speakers expressed the hope that St Patrick could be a positive influence, allowing Irish people to celebrate their diversity. Maybe, some time in the future. There is a legend that on the Last Day, St Patrick will lead all the souls of Ireland to God's judgment seat. They will include unionist and republican, Catholic and Protestant, gay and straight. The argument over decommissioning will be finally laid to rest, and there will be no flags.",

      "trailText": "MPs have to work somewhere. But surely even they deserve something better than the refurbished Portcullis House in Westminster.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The best way for Members of Parliament to get to their new offices in Portcullis House, the latest and most conspicuous extension to the Palace of Westminster, is to take the Jubilee Line to its very own Tube station. And not just because it keeps them in touch with their constituents. By train, they can get to their specially designed desks without so much as a glimpse of the exterior of the building. So, instead of being confronted by one of London's most disappointing new architectural experiences, they will surface in the middle of one of its most exceptional public spaces.</p> <p>As they step off the platform, they will find themselves at the foot of a soaring, vaulted interior, very much like a fragment of the atrium of the Lloyds building, sunk 10 floors down into the ground. High above them, sitting on a spider's web of concrete beams, is Portcullis House itself. Banks of escalators, supported on grey steel trusses, and slung between polished concrete columns slide diagonally back and forth across the void. It is one of the most spectacular and generously proportioned Underground stations in the world.</p> <p>But if MPs turn up by car, from across Westminster Bridge, or on foot from Parliament Square, they will get to see more than enough of Portcullis House, the overcooked, confused tip of an otherwise impressive iceberg. An iceberg that has shouldered its way into the middle of London's most beautiful riverside site, between Big Ben and Norman Shaw's original Scotland Yard. Supple, disciplined, and distinguished below ground, Westminster Station is everything that Portcullis House is not.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, both are the product of the same architect - Michael Hopkins. With the south stand at Lord's, the opera house at Glyndebourne and the tax office at Nottingham under his belt, Hopkins is one of Britain's most skilled and successful architects. As a one-time associate of Norman Foster, he has an unassailable pedigree as a designer of deft modern architecture. But more recently he has assumed something of the mantle of the late Hugh Casson, semi-official architect to the establishment, reckoned to be a safe pair of hands when it comes to dealing with sensitive sites and highly charged public commissions.</p> <p>Portcullis House is certainly both of these. It is also one of London's great architectural lost opportunities. It tries to be simultaneously sensitive to context and 'interestingly' contemporary. In so doing, it manages to be neither. The most conspicuous and jarring element for what is, after all, at heart an office block, is the forest of tubular steel chimneys ranged in great black rows on the skyline. Compared to the delicate stone pinnacles of Pugin and Barry's Westminster, which they forlornly hope to evoke, the chimneys are heavy handed and intimidating.

      "bodyText": "The best way for Members of Parliament to get to their new offices in Portcullis House, the latest and most conspicuous extension to the Palace of Westminster, is to take the Jubilee Line to its very own Tube station. And not just because it keeps them in touch with their constituents. By train, they can get to their specially designed desks without so much as a glimpse of the exterior of the building. So, instead of being confronted by one of London's most disappointing new architectural experiences, they will surface in the middle of one of its most exceptional public spaces. As they step off the platform, they will find themselves at the foot of a soaring, vaulted interior, very much like a fragment of the atrium of the Lloyds building, sunk 10 floors down into the ground. High above them, sitting on a spider's web of concrete beams, is Portcullis House itself. Banks of escalators, supported on grey steel trusses, and slung between polished concrete columns slide diagonally back and forth across the void. It is one of the most spectacular and generously proportioned Underground stations in the world. But if MPs turn up by car, from across Westminster Bridge, or on foot from Parliament Square, they will get to see more than enough of Portcullis House, the overcooked, confused tip of an otherwise impressive iceberg. An iceberg that has shouldered its way into the middle of London's most beautiful riverside site, between Big Ben and Norman Shaw's original Scotland Yard. Supple, disciplined, and distinguished below ground, Westminster Station is everything that Portcullis House is not. Extraordinarily, both are the product of the same architect - Michael Hopkins. With the south stand at Lord's, the opera house at Glyndebourne and the tax office at Nottingham under his belt, Hopkins is one of Britain's most skilled and successful architects. As a one-time associate of Norman Foster, he has an unassailable pedigree as a designer of deft modern architecture. But more recently he has assumed something of the mantle of the late Hugh Casson, semi-official architect to the establishment, reckoned to be a safe pair of hands when it comes to dealing with sensitive sites and highly charged public commissions. Portcullis House is certainly both of these. It is also one of London's great architectural lost opportunities. It tries to be simultaneously sensitive to context and 'interestingly' contemporary. In so doing, it manages to be neither. The most conspicuous and jarring element for what is, after all, at heart an office block, is the forest of tubular steel chimneys ranged in great black rows on the skyline. Compared to the delicate stone pinnacles of Pugin and Barry's Westminster, which they forlornly hope to evoke, the chimneys are heavy handed and intimidating. They suggest nothing so much as the soot-streaked smoke stacks of a Victorian engine shed. The effect is heightened by clusters of what look like smoke ducts which slope diagonally toward each chimney. From a distance, these ducts make it look as if the roof is in the grip of a pair of giant, four-fingered hands attempting to prise off the top floor. As architecture, it is blunt, even bloody-minded, and if only Hopkins had left it at that, it might have come off. But he seems to have lost his nerve halfway through and attempted to pretty up the elevations to ingratiate passers-by. Protruding from the attic storey downward are row upon row of dormer windows, each of them topped by a stainless steel flap. They look like nothing so much as the gun ports of a man o' war, ready to unleash a broadside at Big Ben. Both these elements are, one hopes, the product of Hopkins's laudable concern for environmentally responsible architecture. The flaps are presumably there to cut down on solar gain and the chimneys are part of a natural ventilation system, rather than an alibi for an architect who belongs to the generation that believed ornament was crime and who now wants a way to smuggle in a bit of decoration.

      "body": "<p>Just after I graduated from university, I was commissioned to write a small play for a local theatre company. The opportunity came on the back of a fledgling excursion into writing when, as a student, I had sufficient hubris to present a musical, which I also directed, acted and sang in. I cringe at the thought of it.</p> <p>Nevertheless, playwright Alan Plater, then chairman of the theatre company, saw enough in my crude efforts to give me the chance to work with professional actors. I duly wrote the play and directed it. My chief memory of the experience was at an early performance on tour in Grimsby, where our audience comprised mainly elderly coach parties.</p> <p>The play began with a bleak monologue in the dark. I thought it extremely dramatic. After a few minutes, the audience felt moved to complain noisily of what they assumed was an electrical failure. Then they proceeded to head for the exit. Alan's programme notes described the play as being in the spirit of Patricia Highsmith. I had never heard of Highsmith, but thought I should find some of her work. The book I stumbled across concerned the exploits of a young American living in Europe called Tom Ripley.</p> <p>Almost 20 years later, Sydney Pollack, another mentor, asked me to adapt The Talented Mr Ripley for his company. At that time, I was marooned in my attempts to make The English Patient and felt - on the basis of my one, specious, and not entirely auspicious connection to the author - that it might be something to consider.</p> <p>In the Ripley novels, of which The Talented Mr Ripley is the first, a person can live or die, sometimes literally, on the strength of their choice of cocktail. Taste is everything. Highsmith rarely describes the physical geography, eschews adjectives, sketches out a moment in impatient and irritable prose. There seems little distance between her own baleful view of the world and that of her protagonist's, who travels through a handful of novels, behaving badly, never caught.</p> <p>You enter into an airless, claustrophobic world with Tom Ripley. Almost no other character is fully alive, and his cool, dislocated perspective lures the reader in, convincing us that what objectively might be heinous makes perfect sense inside Ripley's head. The world, experienced through this skinless sensibility, is an alarming place - Ripley feels so intensely, can be giddy with excitement or despair. He is always an outsider, straining for companionship but destined to be alone.</p> <p>His actions are an extreme response to emotions all of us recognise: the sense that there is a better life being lived by somebody else, somewhere else, someone not trapped inside the hollow existence in which we find ourselves. It's one of the things which makes us human. We've all been Tom Ripley, just as we've all known a Dickie Greenleaf, the man who has everything, whose attention makes us feel special. We've all basked in the sunshine of that attention and felt the chill of losing it.</p> <p>It was this unsettling connection to Ripley and the anxiety that what happens to him is familiar, at least in nightmares, that prompted me to make this film. Not the empathy for a hero, but the queasy recognition that this plausible misfit is not so far from one version of ourselves; not approval but an acknowledgment that this is where we might end up without the reassuringly tight belt of morality around our waists.</p> <p>In adapting the novel to film lay the challenge of exciting the audience to commit to the material as I did as a reader, to inhabit each step of Ripley's journey. Adaptation for film is, by definition, a process of editorialising. The dramatist is obliged to make innumerable decisions - what is the book about? How will it fit into the prescribed length of a movie? How to dramatise the secret thoughts the novelist can describe but the film can only suggest; where to begin; how to end; how to collect the tone of the prose.</p> <p>The answer to these questions must inevitably speak as loudly about the preoccupations of the film-maker as they do about the contingent issues of phrasing the material and organising the story for a film audience. Part of the business of reading is to create an inner cinema on which the events play out. And we can be sure that for each reader the film is different. Adaptation is, finally, sharing one's inner cinema with an audience - this is how it felt to me; this is what I thought I was reading. The dramatist becomes an enthusiastic messenger, bringing news from somewhere else, remembering the best bits, exaggerating the beauty, relishing the mystery, probing the moral imperative, watching for gasps or tears, orchestrating them and, ideally, prompting the captive cinema audience to make the pilgrimage back to the book, which remains blessedly itself.</p> <p>But as Italo Calvino said of storytelling, the tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it. The demands of film are also a release, enabling the writer to emphasise and mute by turns. The screenplay is both an argument with the source material and a commentary on it. The uninflected brilliance of Highsmith's novel, its disavowal of moral consequence, Ripley's solipsism, the author's acerbic judgment of everybody other than Ripley, the book's heavy employment of devices - letters, coincidences - do not sit easily within the context of film.</p> <p>But if the intimate gestures of a novel, its private conversation between writer and reader, are not available to the film-maker, they are exchanged for other, equally powerful, tools. Film grammar, with its unique ability to manipulate images, flexing from the intense close-up to the broadest vistas, is perfectly placed to situate personal behaviour in a public landscape. It can contextualise action, remind us that we are as individuals in thrall quite literally to the bigger picture.</p> <p>'This was the clean slate he had thought about on the boat crossing over from America. This was the real annihilation of his past and himself, Tom Ripley, who was made up of that past, and his rebirth as a completely new person.'</p> <p>My reading of Ripley's isolation at the end of the novel, however much he fantasises about the freedom his lies and improvisations have earned him, is that it contains an implicit cautionary tale. What the reader knows is that Ripley's clean slate is an illusion. The rebirth is a temporary disguise and, worse, one that condemns the impostor to a constant fear of exposure.</p> <p>To be uncovered as a sham is the very thing which prompts Ripley to sham in the first place. And so the film came to hinge on a central premise - Ripley's credo that it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. It becomes a story about class. The novel is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. And so the film is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. But it departs in one crucial sense by concluding that eluding public accountability is not the same thing as eluding justice.</p> <p>The film has a moral imperative: you can get away with murder, but you don't really get away with anything. Ripley, always looking for love, has to kill his opportunity for love. He ends the movie alone, free, in a hell of his own making. Just as in Dante, where purgatory is some karmic reflection of life - flatterers pitched in manure, adulterers chasing for ever - so in annihilating self, assuming someone's identity, Ripley is condemned never to be free to be truly himself. This tragic dimension provided an architecture for the screenplay. Its ambitions were to maintain the narrative ambivalence of the novel - not telling an audience what to think, not opting for an announced moral closure, but intensifying the consequence of Ripley's actions on the soul.</p> <p>Without the reassuring appearance of a judge, the audience is asked to be a jury. A number of choices stem directly from this strategy. A signal adjustment to the novel is that Ripley does not plan to kill Dickie; quite the reverse. The death scene begins with Ripley revealing the depth of his feelings for Dickie, horribly miscalculated, cruelly rejected. Dickie dies in an eruption of rage and it is his own capacity for violence which exacerbates a reflexive swing of an oar into a do-or-die struggle. It's an accident which provides Ripley with a defining opportunity.</p> <p>And, as so often in this story, it's an opportunity he seizes as much in shame as in calculation. His journey to purgatory begins with the borrowing of a jacket, because he doesn't possess a decent one of his own. It continues, for what he feels are the same reasons, with the borrowing of an identity.</p> <p>Peter Smith-Kingsley, mentioned only in passing in the novel, becomes a fully-fledged character in the film. His acceptance of Ripley suggested itself as a required irony, a way of dramatising what Highsmith called the annihilation of Ripley's past and himself; in killing Peter he murders his own chance of happiness. Peter, the most centred character in the film, also serves as a reminder that Ripley's pathology is not explained by his sexuality. Similarly, Herbert Greenleaf's relationship with Dickie developed into a crucial strand. The film's mechanism of lies and escape depends on a father's lack of faith in his son, a prejudgment that makes him incapable of seeing Ripley's hand in what has happened. In this way, Ripley can appear to be the better version of Dickie, the son Herbert wishes he had.</p> <p>No one in this story sees truth in front of them because of the distortions of their own prejudices and preconceptions. Only Marge Sherwood, in a more substantive role than the novel allows, has a sufficiently uncluttered spirit to both welcome Ripley and then suspect him. But the collusion of men, such a feature of this story and of the times, undermines her. They are too busy covering up, preferring to interpret Marge's unerring radar for the truth as the misguided forensics of heartbreak.</p> <p>Meredith Logue, a new character for the film, gives Ripley the chance to create his own version of Marge, just as he creates his own version of Dickie. Her presence also accentuates that this is principally a story about young people, each of whom has run away from something, making themselves up in the context of a foreign country, partners as Meredith observes giddily, in disguise . The foreign country is Italy.</p> <p>For two generations before Ripley, Americans had been coming to Europe to explore issues of identity and sexuality. It's no accident that Highsmith had settled in Europe in the Fifties and would have been a contemporary of Marge and Meredith. Nor is it an accident that her book is loosely based on The Ambassadors.</p> <p>The idea of the Grand Tour, of exploring the Old Country, of soaking in the culture of Europe, continues to exert an irresistible tug on American travellers long after Europe's culture has been conquered and transformed by America. Italy, a substantial character in this film, its landscape largely intact from the Renaissance paintings which celebrate it, its history as the artistic and classical heart of the Continent, has particular appeal.</p> <p>'Was it, in short, ever well to be elsewhere when one might be in Italy?' wrote Edith Wharton. By locating the movie a year or two later than the novel, there was an opportunity to explore a significant moment in Italian history, where a thin veneer of the modern had glossed but could not hide the primitive mores of the country.</p> <p>Italy is a place I love above all other places, but it's always possible to detect a darker note under its breezy melodies. And this dissonance seemed to speak of the film itself, apparently sybaritic, but lounging on a volcano. Mongibello, the name Highsmith gave to the fictional village on the Amalfi coast where Dickie and Marge are living, is a local name for Vesuvius.</p> <p>Finally, a film called The Talented Mr Ripley had to address Ripley's talents. If Ripley is blessed and cursed by one thing, it is his ability to turn on a sixpence, to reel off the most elaborate and plausible riffs of fantasy. In identifying this, the importance of music grew in my mind, replacing the more literary motif of painting in the novel. Music for period, music for place, music for argument. And so the screenplay also became a kind of libretto, working out relationships in musical terms, pitting Dickie's identification with jazz, its mantra of freedom and existentialism, against Ripley's classicism and asserting that, just as in music, where truly great extemporising begins with Bach and Mozart, so it is Ripley who proves to be the more genuine improviser.</p> <p>When I adapted The English Patient, I was accompanied on an adventure that involved wholesale reimagining of Michael Ondaatje's novel. Patricia Highsmith died as I began writing the first draft of Ripley and before I could meet her. If I were to have pleased anybody with this adaptation, I would have liked it to have been her and I worked with her own pungent words about fiction as a touchstone. She imagined Ripley sitting at the typewriter with her as she wrote her novel. I imagined her sitting with me as I wrote my screenplay.</p> <p>'If a suspense writer is going to write about murderers and victims, about people in the vortex of this awful whirl of events, he must do more than describe brutality and gore. He should be interested in justice or the absence of it in the world, good and bad, and in human cowardice or courage - but not merely as forces to move his plot in one direction. In a word, his invented people must seem real.'</p> <p>\u0095Taken from The Talented Mr Ripley by Anthony Minghella to be published by Methuen Publishing Limited on 17 February, price \u00a37.99.

      "bodyText": "Just after I graduated from university, I was commissioned to write a small play for a local theatre company. The opportunity came on the back of a fledgling excursion into writing when, as a student, I had sufficient hubris to present a musical, which I also directed, acted and sang in. I cringe at the thought of it. Nevertheless, playwright Alan Plater, then chairman of the theatre company, saw enough in my crude efforts to give me the chance to work with professional actors. I duly wrote the play and directed it. My chief memory of the experience was at an early performance on tour in Grimsby, where our audience comprised mainly elderly coach parties. The play began with a bleak monologue in the dark. I thought it extremely dramatic. After a few minutes, the audience felt moved to complain noisily of what they assumed was an electrical failure. Then they proceeded to head for the exit. Alan's programme notes described the play as being in the spirit of Patricia Highsmith. I had never heard of Highsmith, but thought I should find some of her work. The book I stumbled across concerned the exploits of a young American living in Europe called Tom Ripley. Almost 20 years later, Sydney Pollack, another mentor, asked me to adapt The Talented Mr Ripley for his company. At that time, I was marooned in my attempts to make The English Patient and felt - on the basis of my one, specious, and not entirely auspicious connection to the author - that it might be something to consider. In the Ripley novels, of which The Talented Mr Ripley is the first, a person can live or die, sometimes literally, on the strength of their choice of cocktail. Taste is everything. Highsmith rarely describes the physical geography, eschews adjectives, sketches out a moment in impatient and irritable prose. There seems little distance between her own baleful view of the world and that of her protagonist's, who travels through a handful of novels, behaving badly, never caught. You enter into an airless, claustrophobic world with Tom Ripley. Almost no other character is fully alive, and his cool, dislocated perspective lures the reader in, convincing us that what objectively might be heinous makes perfect sense inside Ripley's head. The world, experienced through this skinless sensibility, is an alarming place - Ripley feels so intensely, can be giddy with excitement or despair. He is always an outsider, straining for companionship but destined to be alone. His actions are an extreme response to emotions all of us recognise: the sense that there is a better life being lived by somebody else, somewhere else, someone not trapped inside the hollow existence in which we find ourselves. It's one of the things which makes us human. We've all been Tom Ripley, just as we've all known a Dickie Greenleaf, the man who has everything, whose attention makes us feel special. We've all basked in the sunshine of that attention and felt the chill of losing it. It was this unsettling connection to Ripley and the anxiety that what happens to him is familiar, at least in nightmares, that prompted me to make this film. Not the empathy for a hero, but the queasy recognition that this plausible misfit is not so far from one version of ourselves; not approval but an acknowledgment that this is where we might end up without the reassuringly tight belt of morality around our waists. In adapting the novel to film lay the challenge of exciting the audience to commit to the material as I did as a reader, to inhabit each step of Ripley's journey. Adaptation for film is, by definition, a process of editorialising. The dramatist is obliged to make innumerable decisions - what is the book about? How will it fit into the prescribed length of a movie? How to dramatise the secret thoughts the novelist can describe but the film can only suggest; where to begin; how to end; how to collect the tone of the prose. The answer to these questions must inevitably speak as loudly about the preoccupations of the film-maker as they do about the contingent issues of phrasing the material and organising the story for a film audience. Part of the business of reading is to create an inner cinema on which the events play out. And we can be sure that for each reader the film is different. Adaptation is, finally, sharing one's inner cinema with an audience - this is how it felt to me; this is what I thought I was reading. The dramatist becomes an enthusiastic messenger, bringing news from somewhere else, remembering the best bits, exaggerating the beauty, relishing the mystery, probing the moral imperative, watching for gasps or tears, orchestrating them and, ideally, prompting the captive cinema audience to make the pilgrimage back to the book, which remains blessedly itself. But as Italo Calvino said of storytelling, the tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it. The demands of film are also a release, enabling the writer to emphasise and mute by turns. The screenplay is both an argument with the source material and a commentary on it. The uninflected brilliance of Highsmith's novel, its disavowal of moral consequence, Ripley's solipsism, the author's acerbic judgment of everybody other than Ripley, the book's heavy employment of devices - letters, coincidences - do not sit easily within the context of film. But if the intimate gestures of a novel, its private conversation between writer and reader, are not available to the film-maker, they are exchanged for other, equally powerful, tools. Film grammar, with its unique ability to manipulate images, flexing from the intense close-up to the broadest vistas, is perfectly placed to situate personal behaviour in a public landscape. It can contextualise action, remind us that we are as individuals in thrall quite literally to the bigger picture. 'This was the clean slate he had thought about on the boat crossing over from America. This was the real annihilation of his past and himself, Tom Ripley, who was made up of that past, and his rebirth as a completely new person.' My reading of Ripley's isolation at the end of the novel, however much he fantasises about the freedom his lies and improvisations have earned him, is that it contains an implicit cautionary tale. What the reader knows is that Ripley's clean slate is an illusion. The rebirth is a temporary disguise and, worse, one that condemns the impostor to a constant fear of exposure. To be uncovered as a sham is the very thing which prompts Ripley to sham in the first place. And so the film came to hinge on a central premise - Ripley's credo that it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. It becomes a story about class. The novel is about a man who commits murders and is not caught. And so the film is about a man who commits murders and is not caught.

The film has a moral imperative: you can get away with murder, but you don't really get away with anything. Ripley, always looking for love, has to kill his opportunity for love. He ends the movie alone, free, in a hell of his own making.

Still, Crisp would certainly have appreciated Adrover's inventiveness and sense of humour - a shirt worn back to front with a tie wrapped at the nape of the neck; a pair of New York Yankees baseball caps sewn into a sweatshirt as shoulder pads, and a traditional Burberry coat made into a dress by wrapping it around the body inside out, and back to front. 'I think wherever he is, he'll be really proud. It was his spirit walking on the catwalk,' says Adrover. 'He's always been so elegant.' The mattress outfit, which Adrover will not lend out to fashion stylists unless he accompanies it to the photo shoot, was even teamed with a scarf tied at the neck, a fake Fendi bought from Canal Street, in homage to Crisp's own jaunty style.",

This week Ministers face an unprecedented vote against government policy at the weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, open to all MPs. There has not been a vote at any PLP meeting since 1997, which operates by 'managed consensus', but six Labour MPs have forced a motion on to Wednesday's agenda, saying 'this PLP believes the National Minimum Wage should be uprated annually in April'. Byers will justify the freeze by saying that the Government needs time to measure its effect on jobs. But government caution comes when it appears the political battle over a minimum wage has been decisively won. On the employers' side the CBI has acknowledged it has not caused major job losses, although it has increased the burden of regulation for small businesses. The Conservatives - whose leaders once forecast that the minimum wage could cost up to two million jobs, depending on the level at which it was set - have now withdrawn their threat to abolish it.

As it is widely believed that Tony Blair will call a general election for May 2001, a large increase in the minimum wage a month earlier will be seen by many as a transparent election ploy. The driving force behind Wednesday's PLP vote, Gordon Prentice, has written to fellow Labour MPs urging them to attend and condemning the rumoured plan to raise the minimum wage in the run-up to a general election as 'the worst kind of gesture politics'. In December a petition organised by Labour MP Diana Organ in favour of uprating the minimum wage drew support from 93 Labour MPs. Party business managers are already alarmed by the prospect of a formal vote which could reveal the extent of Labour opposition to the Government. There is likely to be heavy pressure on the rebels in the next three days to have a debate but not force a vote. Prentice forecast: 'The pressure will be absolutely immense. I'm going to speak to people on Monday and Tuesday and work out how to proceed, but the reality is that if it is not pushed to a vote now it could be long time before there is another opportunity.'",

      "body": "<p>For 18 of his 27 years in prison, a small cell on Robben Island was, for Nelson Mandela, the only here and now. Yet in a very real sense it also encompassed all there was of 'there' and of 'then', of 'before' and 'after'. And perhaps it was precisely his ability to see beyond the here and now of cell and island, the full complexities of a larger world, that enabled Mandela to assume, upon his release into that world, all the bearable heaviness of his country.</p> <p>In South Africa today, there are other complexities attached to our notions of where we are, where we come from, where we may be heading. I remember from years ago in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape the sense of existential disorientation caused by a blank wall in the airport building (at the time still ominously known as 'HF Verwoerd') announcing very emphatically, 'YOU ARE NOW HERE', unaccompanied by any plan or map. This may not be unlike the puzzle of the new South Africa. Exactly 10 years ago, our version of the Berlin Wall collapsed with the unbanning of liberation movements and the release of Mandela. Today, many South Africans argue that life is going on exactly as before, while many others insist everything has changed, and changed utterly. The question may well be how we arrived here from where we were. Or, more succinctly, where exactly is 'here'?</p> <p>An answer is complicated by the fact that the two main players of 1990 have both left the official scene. Of course, Mandela remains a significant presence in the conscience of the world, but de Klerk's historical role has rapidly faded ('Oh, was he the one who\u0085 ?'). This in itself may suggest something about the present and the possibilities for the future. De Klerk was the man with the mentality of a civil servant thrust by history into a role too big for him. Moreover, he acted palpably against his own inclination, trying to thwart, every inch of the way, the process he himself had set in motion. Ever since February 1990 he has missed each of his appointments with history - most lamentably when, in his appearance before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he hid behind legalistic ploys to shirk his ultimate responsibility.

This does not mean that he made no mistakes. Those invariably arose from a refusal to accept that allies or friends could have feet of clay, a negligence of nuts and bolts in favour of the larger view, an old-fashioned authoritarianism.

One of the great imponderables of the situation was the threat of violence from the Afrikaner Right, drawing on the mythology of heroism going back to the Boer War and beyond. But this threat collapsed when, in the run-up to the elections of April 1994, the attempt to take over the black homeland of Bophuthatswana ended in messy failure. It marked a turning away from violence as a solution for difficult or dangerous situations, towards the politics of peaceful negotiation. This ensured that the country would remain a beacon to the world, no longer as a reminder of the racism lurking in the darker recesses of practically every human society, but as an example of a different mode of thinking, a new way of viewing problems as challenges. And it is important, not just for South Africa but for the world, that we succeed. The alternative is Bosnia, Rwanda, or Chechnya.</p> <p>The free elections of April 1994 might have been a moment so brief and bright that it appeared all too easy, afterwards, to discount it as illusion.

They keep us going, the dreams that ultimately justify the effort and disillusionment leading to the renewed dedication without which human progress is unthinkable. Those of us who stood in the long queues of that April day to perform the simplest of actions imaginable - drawing a cross in a square - will never forget the exhilaration in what the writer Njabulo Ndebele has called the rediscovery of the ordinary.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Over recent months, Yves Saint Laurent has been responsible for making much ink flow. First came the hot news that Gucci had bought up YSL's ready-to-wear and perfume businesses, that the Italian house's designer Tom Ford was taking over as creative director of both, and that one of its major backers, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, had separately snapped up Saint Laurent's haute couture house. Then came the women's spring/summer collections in October, where Saint Laurent's influence was as strong as ever. Prada's seminal 'Lady' collection drew heavily on YSL references. His signature pussycat bows appeared time and again on the international catwalks, and the trench coat (which he introduced into the female wardrobe back in the 60s) established itself as one of this season's major trends. Finally, this January, Saint Laurent organised a party at the newly refurbished Pompidou Centre in Paris to celebrate the reopening of its modern art museum. The designer and his business partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 had partly sponsored the renovation with what was only the latest in a series of generous donations to art institutions. In 1997, for example, an Yves Saint Laurent room was opened in the French-painting wing of the National Gallery in London after the pair handed over a gift of \u00a31 million.</p> <p>At the Pompidou Centre party, the designer posed in front of a Matisse and then a Mir\u00f3. He smiled for the cameras with close friends, such as Betty Catroux and Loulou de la Falaise, and surprised everyone by staying for hours. Indeed, he surprised everyone by simply turning up. For nowadays, his public appearances are few and far between. For at least a decade now, he has lived as a near recluse. In 1998, he told the trendy fashion magazine Dutch: 'I can't go out. I am afraid of the outside world, of the street, of the crowd. I only feel comfortable at home with my dog, my pencils and my paper.'</p> <p>In general, the only sightings of him are limited to his twice-yearly haute couture shows. He comes out at the end to take his bows, looking rather uneasy and grimacing a smile. The idea of appearing in front of an audience obviously terrifies him, and you find yourself praying that his unsteady legs will actually carry him to the end of the catwalk and back.</p> <p>The idea of meeting journalists is also something he quite obviously does not cherish. The interviews he gives are few and far between (an average of not more than two a year), and Saint Laurent has been known to escape out of the back door of his couture house at the last minute to avoid a meeting. While his press officer goes to welcome a journalist, he quickly makes his getaway so that when she returns, Monsieur Saint Laurent is no longer to be found.</p> <p>The one quality absolutely necessary if you do wish to meet him is patience. It was actually one of Saint Laurent's press officers who suggested that I interview him. That was last January. Yet it was not until more than a year later that an appointment was finally arranged. Two days later, that was cancelled, another organised, and I was beginning to suspect that the meeting would never happen. I was therefore far from reassured when I finally turned up at the agreed time only to discover that fashion's greatest living legend was not actually there. A quick call was put through to Saint Laurent's apartment on the Left Bank, and the news came through that he was on his way. Some 20 minutes later, I had made it. I was being led to his office.</p> <p>It is situated on the first floor of the Napoleon III building on Paris's Avenue Marceau, which had been home to his couture house since 1974. In the corridor, you walk past an Andy Warhol screen print of the young Saint Laurent. Tall, tan leather-coloured doors open up into what is a surprisingly small but richly decorated room. It is a crimson and gold affair. To one side is a coffee table and screen by Jean-Michel Frank. On a mantelpiece stands a painting of Diana Vreeland by French artist Christian B\u00e9rard. To one side is a large photo of Saint Laurent's mother. Between the two windows is an imposing portrait of his great-great grandfather, the lawyer who drew up Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine's wedding contract. The desk on which it was signed is now Saint Laurent's. On it stand two ornate drop-crystal lamps, a vase full of pungent lilies and a pot crammed with blue HB pencils.</p> <p>The designer himself is dressed in a dark suit, white shirt with black stripes and a checked tie. Wearing his trademark glasses, he chain-smokes throughout our meeting. Part-way through, we are joined by his nine-year-old French bulldog Moujik III, after he starts scratching at the door. Saint Laurent takes him everywhere and informs me that he is the sweetest-natured of all the dogs he has had (his predecessors, Moujik I and Moujik II, were also bulldogs). Once the door has been opened, Moujik III rushes in, sneezes loudly, and then proceeds to chew on my left trouser leg.</p> <p>I must admit to approaching the meeting with a certain amount of trepidation. I had seen a TV interview with the designer a couple of years ago, during which his answers were so short and sweet they were more or less monosyllabic. I thus expected it to be incredibly hard work. Plus, there is also the preconception that Saint Laurent is not quite all there. 'Was he out to lunch?' asked a journalist friend when I told her that I had met him. My answer was a quite categorical, 'Not at all'. Indeed, those close to him say that he has quite a lot of mettle. 'He's very shy, but very determined,' says Loulou de la Falaise. 'He's actually really quite feisty.'</p> <p>In person, his speech is a little laboured and there are the odd moments of unease. At times, for example, he bows his head to the left, seems to freeze and remains silent for a good 10 seconds at a time. At first, you wonder whether everything is all right. Then you realise he is simply weighing up the best way to talk about an extremely delicate and personal subject. Otherwise, he is almost the total opposite of most people's perceptions of him. He is totally on the ball, really quite funny, friendly, charming, courteous and surprisingly chatty. He takes obvious delight, for example, in recounting the episode in the 70s when it was announced on the radio that he was dead. 'So many journalists besieged Monsieur Berg\u00e9's office,' he recalls. 'He told them, \"It's not true. He is busy working on his next collection.\" And they replied, \"Despite all the faith we have in you, our editors made us promise to see Monsieur Saint Laurent in the flesh.\" So, Berg\u00e9 left the door of the studio where I was working ajar, and I saw all of these heads popping round it. I didn't have time to talk to them because I was busy. In any case, they had just come to check that I was still alive.'</p> <p>Saint Laurent often displays a quite childlike glee in the telling of his stories, and there is certainly something of the Peter Pan about him. 'He has the vision of a child,' says Berg\u00e9, 'and is also someone full of mystery.' That may certainly be the public image, but in conversation, he displays a quite courageous openness and honesty. He talks freely about his battles with alcohol, his problems with others, and even admits to a certain lack of generosity. A few years ago, he told the German magazine Focus that he was 'terribly bored'. Today, however, it seems that Saint Laurent is finally getting the upper hand over his demons.</p> <p>'When I stopped drinking, I had a lot of trouble communicating with other people,' he says. 'It's taken me 10 years to start to get things into order, but now I am becoming the person I once was again. Things are starting to sort themselves out.' His last haute couture collection, much of which was based on a Spanish theme, certainly exuded a new energy. In the boleros and gypsy dresses, there was much more freedom and fantasy than has been seen from Saint Laurent in a long while. 'I designed it with a lot of joy,' he tells me. 'Of course, there were moments of panic and doubt, but much less than usual. I was much more serene about it.'</p> <p>He remains haunted by a desire for perfection and is still extremely worried about the reactions of the press and his clients to each collection, which seems like a quite ridiculous anomaly. After all, in fashion terms, Saint Laurent really has nothing left to prove. Almost any other leading designer will cite him as their idol. Marc Jacobs refers to him as God. Tom Ford and Jean-Paul Gaultier call him their mentor. His place in the annals of fashion is well-assured. For autumn 1965, for example, he rocked the world with his Mondrian print dresses. For spring 1966, he created the first female tuxedo and was the first designer to show transparency on the runway in 1968. In 1966, he also became the first couturier to open a ready-to-wear boutique, and on French television at the end of the 60s, Coco Chanel pronounced him her spiritual successor.</p> <p>'I learned a lot from her, even though I didn't know her,' he tells me. 'She wanted to meet me. Monsieur Berg\u00e9 was very friendly with her and she kept saying to him, \"Bring Saint Laurent to see me\", but I was too scared of her. I was much shyer back then and felt very intimated by her. Nowadays, I really regret not having known her. The only encounter I had with her was when I bumped into her at the Ritz, where she was having lunch. She told me, \"No more miniskirts, Saint Laurent!\"'</p> <p>For many, the zenith of his career came in 1976, with the presentation of his famed Ballets Russes collection. The designer himself believes the collections, inspired by Picasso (winter '79/80) and Braque (summer '88), were his best, and that his greatest contribution to fashion was 'having put women into trouser suits and given them men's clothing which was adapted to their bodies. I also feel that I have managed to create my own style and to consolidate it. A couturier who doesn't have his own style is not a couturier. Fashions change, but a style remains.'</p> <p>Yet his professional success has long been counterbalanced by a problematic personal life. 'It was in achieving his dreams that he closed the door to his own life,' says the fashion editor of Le Monde, Laurence Bena\u00efm, in her Saint Laurent biography. His troubles and woes have been well documented: the times he spent in the American Hospital in Neuilly for depression in the 70s, as well as his battles with alcohol and drugs. He initially started taking pills and drink around 1958. 'It was a way for me to escape reality,' he says. 'A means of seeing life in a different light, as more beautiful than it actually is.'</p> <p>This inability to cope with the realities of the world is surely one of Saint Laurent's greatest tragedies. Rather than facing up to the challenges of existence, he prefers to disappear off into some dream world, a universe quite Proustian in nature. His passion for the writer is well known. He sometimes refers to himself as 'Swann' and has named each of the rooms in his Normandy ch\u00e2teau after a character in Remembrance of Things Past. Living in this parallel universe, however, has ultimately distanced him from life. 'At one time, he was drinking two or three litres of Pastis a day and also taking amphetamines,' says the former model Victoire, who helped Saint Laurent set up his own house. She also reveals that he was in a coma for a number of days at the beginning of the 80s.</p> <p>'I am a very unhappy person,' he affirms. 'I do harm to myself, but I think it's something which will wear off. It's difficult because I'm an extremely complicated being.'</p> <p>His life never seems to have been easy. He was born in 1936 into a bourgeois family in Oran, Algeria. As a gay aesthete, he was taunted at school ('Being homosexual in Oran was like being a murderer,' he has said) and seems to have taken a long time to come to terms with his sexuality (he only openly admitted to being gay in a 1991 interview in the French daily Le Figaro). He originally dreamed of becoming a theatre set designer after seeing a production of Moli\u00e8re's The School of Women on which Christian B\u00e9rard had worked. Instead, at the age of 17, he won third prize in a prestigious fashion competition and the following year, moved to Paris to study at the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale. He arrived with an introduction to the director of French Vogue, Michel de Brunhoff, who would later set up a meeting for him at Dior. Hired immediately, he was taken under Christian Dior's protective wing. 'Monsieur Dior was quite wonderful,' he remembers. 'He was both an extraordinary designer and an extraordinary man. He was perfect. So kind and generous. For me, he was very much like a father.'</p> <p>In October 1957, Dior went away on holiday to Montecatini in Italy. On the day of his departure, he said to his sales director, 'I am going away without any worries. I am leaving you with Yves.' Dior would never return. On 24 October, he died of a heart attack and on 15 November, Saint Laurent was named as his successor. His first collection, the Trapeze line, was a triumph, pushing up sales 35 per cent. Two and a half years later, however, he was sacked. The news came after he had suffered a nervous breakdown just 20 days into his national service. The excuse was a bad collection. The reality was probably that the owner did not like him.</p> <p>In 1961, Saint Laurent set up his own couture house with the help of his then lover, Pierre Berg\u00e9. The pair had first met at a dinner just a few days after Saint Laurent's first collection for Dior. At the time, Berg\u00e9 was the lover and manager of Bernard Buffet, the Parisian painter of the moment. In the same weekend, at a house party in the south of France, Buffet went off with his future wife, Annabelle, and Berg\u00e9 and Saint Laurent hooked up. Three months later, they had decided to live together. For a short time in 1959, Saint Laurent moved out, but they were soon back together, and Berg\u00e9 has played a key role in the designer's life ever since. It was he who rescued Saint Laurent from the psychiatric ward of a Parisian hospital after his nervous breakdown. He also found the money to set up Saint Laurent's couture house, and has been the business brains behind the company. The pair split in 1976, but it was not until 1986 that Berg\u00e9 finally moved out. Even today, everything they own is in both their names.</p> <p>It is almost impossible to find two more contrasting characters. While Saint Laurent is timid and passive, Berg\u00e9 is full of energy, vital and active. In contrast to the designer's self-confessed masochistic tendencies, Berg\u00e9 seems to take great pleasure in wielding his power to get the better of others. Indeed, as Saint Laurent has withdrawn from the world, Berg\u00e9's position has grown in importance. In 1988, he was appointed head of the Paris Opera. He used to be a close friend of the late Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and at some time or other has been president of practically every French fashion organisation. 'You could say that Pierre drove Yves because he loved him, or because Yves was, finally, the source of everything - his power, his reputation, his fortune,' a friend of Saint Laurent's told The New Yorker a few years ago. 'Pierre wanted to make him a star and a great talent,' opines Victoire. 'But along the way, he forgot about the man.' Strangely enough, what they both share is a sense of frustration. For, while Berg\u00e9 regrets not having been a writer, Saint Laurent tells me he himself 'should have been a painter'. 'Monsieur Berg\u00e9 is somebody extremely precious for me,' he asserts. 'He has done a lot for me and I think I needed him. Although I have a naturally quite lively character, I needed someone to open up the doors to the outside world for me. I also think that we have perfectly complemented each other professionally. He is a businessman, whereas I don't have a clue.' Indeed, Berg\u00e9 is a very skilled financial mover. In 1993, he sold the fashion house to pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi for \u00a3409 million. He also masterminded its recent acquisition by Gucci.</p> <p>It is a deal which Saint Laurent seems almost blissfully happy about. 'Gucci is dealing with the worst part, and I have held on to the best bit,' he says, obviously very pleased with himself. 'They have no say in the couture house, so I maintain my freedom to do whatever I like.' He also speaks highly of Tom Ford. 'He is dynamic and full of life. I greatly appreciate his way of seeing things and think he has a lot of talent.' Whether Ford will replace Alber Elbaz as the designer of the house's women's ready-to-wear is currently a topic of hot speculation. When the Israeli-born designer took over the collection in June 1998, it couldn't have come soon enough for Saint Laurent. 'It was an enormous relief,' he admits. 'I'm now 63 and started out at the age of 20. I just considered that I didn't have the necessary force to continue with the ready-to-wear.' And what does he think of the job Elbaz has done so far?</p> <p>'At the beginning, I think he was frightened,' he replies, 'and I fully understand that. But the more collections he does, the better it gets.' His praise for the house's hot menswear designer Hedi Slimane, on the other hand, is without reserve. 'I adore him,' he declares. 'He has a lot of personality.' Both appointments were carried out by Berg\u00e9 rather than Saint Laurent, and I ask whether he had ever considered taking someone under his wing as Christian Dior had done with him. The answer is admirably honest. 'I never found anyone,' he says, 'and it must be said that I have difficulty with people. I am quite self-centred and don't really have what it takes to help somebody. Maybe I'll be able to transmit everything I know when I'm a bit older, but for the moment, I have to admit that I lack the necessary generosity.'</p> <p>In recent years, he has not been very generous either in his comments about other designers. 'I really miss the times when I had to battle with the greats, like Balenciaga, Chanel and Givenchy,' he asserts. 'It was much more difficult then. I really don't think much of the other couturiers nowadays.' The exception is Jean-Paul Gaultier. 'He has a lot of talent,' enthuses Saint Laurent. 'He has a wonderful technique and I also like the rather sensual atmosphere he creates. He's the only person who could perhaps replace me one day.'</p> <p>Not, that is, that he is thinking of quitting in the near future. 'I love my house and my staff too much,' he insists. 'I have 200 people in the ateliers and am the only couture house which is still successful. All the ladies come here because they can't find anything they like elsewhere.' Then, of course, there is the problem of how he would spend his retirement. 'If I didn't make dresses, I don't know what I'd do,' he says. Suddenly, however, an idea comes to him, as if in a flash: 'Well, maybe I'd write.' Until two years ago, he wrote regularly and would like to take it up again. 'My output was like a cry or a shout. I used to have two \"godmothers\" who wanted me to publish my work: Nathalie Sarraute and Marguerite Duras. So I was in good hands.'</p> <p>It would certainly be a fitting finale for Saint Laurent. After years of making poetry out of fabrics, he may well end up writing verse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over recent months, Yves Saint Laurent has been responsible for making much ink flow. First came the hot news that Gucci had bought up YSL's ready-to-wear and perfume businesses, that the Italian house's designer Tom Ford was taking over as creative director of both, and that one of its major backers, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, had separately snapped up Saint Laurent's haute couture house. Then came the women's spring/summer collections in October, where Saint Laurent's influence was as strong as ever. Prada's seminal 'Lady' collection drew heavily on YSL references. His signature pussycat bows appeared time and again on the international catwalks, and the trench coat (which he introduced into the female wardrobe back in the 60s) established itself as one of this season's major trends. Finally, this January, Saint Laurent organised a party at the newly refurbished Pompidou Centre in Paris to celebrate the reopening of its modern art museum. The designer and his business partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 had partly sponsored the renovation with what was only the latest in a series of generous donations to art institutions. In 1997, for example, an Yves Saint Laurent room was opened in the French-painting wing of the National Gallery in London after the pair handed over a gift of \u00a31 million. At the Pompidou Centre party, the designer posed in front of a Matisse and then a Mir\u00f3. He smiled for the cameras with close friends, such as Betty Catroux and Loulou de la Falaise, and surprised everyone by staying for hours. Indeed, he surprised everyone by simply turning up. For nowadays, his public appearances are few and far between. For at least a decade now, he has lived as a near recluse. In 1998, he told the trendy fashion magazine Dutch: 'I can't go out. I am afraid of the outside world, of the street, of the crowd. I only feel comfortable at home with my dog, my pencils and my paper.' In general, the only sightings of him are limited to his twice-yearly haute couture shows. He comes out at the end to take his bows, looking rather uneasy and grimacing a smile. The idea of appearing in front of an audience obviously terrifies him, and you find yourself praying that his unsteady legs will actually carry him to the end of the catwalk and back. The idea of meeting journalists is also something he quite obviously does not cherish. The interviews he gives are few and far between (an average of not more than two a year), and Saint Laurent has been known to escape out of the back door of his couture house at the last minute to avoid a meeting. While his press officer goes to welcome a journalist, he quickly makes his getaway so that when she returns, Monsieur Saint Laurent is no longer to be found. The one quality absolutely necessary if you do wish to meet him is patience. It was actually one of Saint Laurent's press officers who suggested that I interview him. That was last January. Yet it was not until more than a year later that an appointment was finally arranged. Two days later, that was cancelled, another organised, and I was beginning to suspect that the meeting would never happen. I was therefore far from reassured when I finally turned up at the agreed time only to discover that fashion's greatest living legend was not actually there. A quick call was put through to Saint Laurent's apartment on the Left Bank, and the news came through that he was on his way. Some 20 minutes later, I had made it. I was being led to his office. It is situated on the first floor of the Napoleon III building on Paris's Avenue Marceau, which had been home to his couture house since 1974. In the corridor, you walk past an Andy Warhol screen print of the young Saint Laurent. Tall, tan leather-coloured doors open up into what is a surprisingly small but richly decorated room. It is a crimson and gold affair. To one side is a coffee table and screen by Jean-Michel Frank. On a mantelpiece stands a painting of Diana Vreeland by French artist Christian B\u00e9rard. To one side is a large photo of Saint Laurent's mother. Between the two windows is an imposing portrait of his great-great grandfather, the lawyer who drew up Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine's wedding contract. The desk on which it was signed is now Saint Laurent's. On it stand two ornate drop-crystal lamps, a vase full of pungent lilies and a pot crammed with blue HB pencils. The designer himself is dressed in a dark suit, white shirt with black stripes and a checked tie. Wearing his trademark glasses, he chain-smokes throughout our meeting. Part-way through, we are joined by his nine-year-old French bulldog Moujik III, after he starts scratching at the door. Saint Laurent takes him everywhere and informs me that he is the sweetest-natured of all the dogs he has had (his predecessors, Moujik I and Moujik II, were also bulldogs). Once the door has been opened, Moujik III rushes in, sneezes loudly, and then proceeds to chew on my left trouser leg. I must admit to approaching the meeting with a certain amount of trepidation. I had seen a TV interview with the designer a couple of years ago, during which his answers were so short and sweet they were more or less monosyllabic. I thus expected it to be incredibly hard work. Plus, there is also the preconception that Saint Laurent is not quite all there. 'Was he out to lunch?' asked a journalist friend when I told her that I had met him. My answer was a quite categorical, 'Not at all'. Indeed, those close to him say that he has quite a lot of mettle. 'He's very shy, but very determined,' says Loulou de la Falaise. 'He's actually really quite feisty.' In person, his speech is a little laboured and there are the odd moments of unease. At times, for example, he bows his head to the left, seems to freeze and remains silent for a good 10 seconds at a time. At first, you wonder whether everything is all right. Then you realise he is simply weighing up the best way to talk about an extremely delicate and personal subject. Otherwise, he is almost the total opposite of most people's perceptions of him. He is totally on the ball, really quite funny, friendly, charming, courteous and surprisingly chatty. He takes obvious delight, for example, in recounting the episode in the 70s when it was announced on the radio that he was dead. 'So many journalists besieged Monsieur Berg\u00e9's office,' he recalls. 'He told them, \"It's not true. He is busy working on his next collection.\" And they replied, \"Despite all the faith we have in you, our editors made us promise to see Monsieur Saint Laurent in the flesh.\" So, Berg\u00e9 left the door of the studio where I was working ajar, and I saw all of these heads popping round it. I didn't have time to talk to them because I was busy. In any case, they had just come to check that I was still alive.' Saint Laurent often displays a quite childlike glee in the telling of his stories, and there is certainly something of the Peter Pan about him. 'He has the vision of a child,' says Berg\u00e9, 'and is also someone full of mystery.' That may certainly be the public image, but in conversation, he displays a quite courageous openness and honesty. He talks freely about his battles with alcohol, his problems with others, and even admits to a certain lack of generosity. A few years ago, he told the German magazine Focus that he was 'terribly bored'. Today, however, it seems that Saint Laurent is finally getting the upper hand over his demons. 'When I stopped drinking, I had a lot of trouble communicating with other people,' he says. 'It's taken me 10 years to start to get things into order, but now I am becoming the person I once was again. Things are starting to sort themselves out.' His last haute couture collection, much of which was based on a Spanish theme, certainly exuded a new energy. In the boleros and gypsy dresses, there was much more freedom and fantasy than has been seen from Saint Laurent in a long while. 'I designed it with a lot of joy,' he tells me. 'Of course, there were moments of panic and doubt, but much less than usual. I was much more serene about it.' He remains haunted by a desire for perfection and is still extremely worried about the reactions of the press and his clients to each collection, which seems like a quite ridiculous anomaly. After all, in fashion terms, Saint Laurent really has nothing left to prove. Almost any other leading designer will cite him as their idol. Marc Jacobs refers to him as God. Tom Ford and Jean-Paul Gaultier call him their mentor. His place in the annals of fashion is well-assured. For autumn 1965, for example, he rocked the world with his Mondrian print dresses. For spring 1966, he created the first female tuxedo and was the first designer to show transparency on the runway in 1968.

      "body": "<p>Not only do the darker winter months do little for our moods, but the lack of ultraviolet (UV) rays also deprives our body of its major source of vitamin D - a nutrient we need principally to work in conjunction with calcium to produce strong bones and teeth. The action of the sun's UV rays on our skin stimulates the body to produce its most active and effective form of vitamin D, known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, but between the months of October and March, few UV rays reach us, which means that to meet the necessary levels, our bodies have to rely both on vitamin D accumulated during the sunny months and stored in the liver and body fat, as well as far less efficient dietary sources.</p> <p>Although relatively rare, extreme lack of vitamin D (especially during times of rapid growth in adolescence) causes the bones to become weak and leads to the development of either rickets or osteomalacia. This condition more commonly affects old people, who have inadequate vitamin D intake (either through lack of appetite, or poor choice of foods) and, more significantly, very little exposure to natural sunlight. Rickets and osteomalacia are the commonest signs of deficiency, but vitamin D deficiency, or calciferol deficiency, as it is also known, may also manifest itself as defective calcification of the dentine of the teeth and can cause an increased susceptibility to dental caries. Even the ear can be affected, causing conductive hearing loss: lack of vitamin D reduces the concentration of calcium in the fluid of the inner ear, causing the formation of a new type of spongy bone, which interferes with sound transmission, and is one of the signs of a condition known as otosclerosis.</p> <p>Exposure to the sun's UV rays keeps the majority of the developed world's population free of such diseases. However, rickets and other deficiency symptoms can occur in children who are either exposed to physical neglect, or have poorly balanced dietary intakes, sometimes the result of extreme and faddy diets - following a macrobiotic way of life, for example, or eating an unbalanced vegetarian diet. By the way, if you are vegetarian or vegan, you should be aware that animal-derived vitamin D is sometimes added to manufactured products. A list of animal-free products can be obtained from the Vegetarian Society (0161 928 0793).</p> <p>Deficiency can also occur in children who are placed on so-called healthy eating regimes, in which they have no visible fat or dairy products and who eat a diet built primarily around vegetables and fruits, with a few whole grains thrown in (they are sometimes referred to as 'muesli babies'). The belief that this is a healthier way for children to eat is misplaced. It's very important that children have some fat in their diet to help their body absorb the fat-soluble vitamins - A, E and D - which is why I recommend they drink full-cream milk up until the age of five and have full-fat cheese and yoghurt. That way you're giving them an invaluable source of these essential vitamins, as well as a hefty dose of calcium.</p> <p>The body needs to receive a daily dose of calcium to work with the vitamin D to form new bone tissue. Ideally, you should get it from calcium-rich foods, such as cheese, yoghurt and milk - aim for 1 1/2 pints of milk, 400g/14oz of yoghurt or 100g/4oz of cheese a day. Non-dairy sources include green, leafy vegetables, such as spinach, canned fish with soft, edible bones (sardines, pilchards, salmon and mackerel), sesame seeds and tahini, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts, calcium-enriched soya cheeses and milk. These non-dairy sources don't contain as much calcium as dairy products, however, and are not as easily absorbed, so you will need to eat a lot more of them to derive the same amount of calcium. Calcium supplements are an option, especially for people with poor appetites, but you should talk to your doctor first.</p> <p>Meanwhile, vitamin D's strengths don't just lie in the bones - scientists appear to be coming to the conclusion that since vitamin D has a role to play in cell differentiation, keeping the body well stocked with vitamin D may help to prevent and treat certain cancers (the breast, colon, rectum and prostate). You can avoid tipping the balance towards obesity and heart disease by not overindulging in dairy products.</p> <p>In the majority of cases, we manage to produce enough vitamin D through safe exposure to the sun's UV rays, during the spring and summer months, to last us throughout the year. Sun creams do not inhibit the production of calciferol, so you must protect the body from the harmful sun's rays, while exposing your skin. Deficiencies occur most commonly when someone is kept out of the sun for long periods of time, perhaps if they have to spend a long time in bed through illness or live in institutions where little time is spent outside. Without sufficient exposure to the sun, it's vital to keep up the body's calciferol levels by ensuring a diet rich in vitamin D. The most valuable sources include oily fish such as tuna, mackerel or sardines, cod liver oil, liver, eggs, butter and margarine, cheese, milk and yoghurt. If you are not exposed to daylight on a regular basis, you need to consume 12-micrograms (500IUs) of vitamin D every day to maintain the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels - which in real terms equates to 150g sardines or smoked mackerel and about 5g of cod liver oil. (You'd need to consume 150g margarine to derive similar quantities.)</p> <p>If you're prepared to eat oily fish every day (sardines on toast, smoked mackerel with poached egg) or take some cod liver oil in the morning, then the requirement can be easily met. However, for the majority of people in the 'at risk' groups (those that are not exposed to sunlight on a day-to-day basis or have malabsorption problems), especially children and old people with poor appetites, it's simpler to take a 10-microgram (400IU) supplement or whatever dose your dietitian prescribes. In addition, however, you should still include as many vitamin D-rich foods as possible in your diet, because the body will glean other beneficial nutrients (such as vitamins A and E - both strong antioxidants) as part of the package.</p> <p>Some people may become depleted of vitamin D, not as a result of lack of sunlight or poor dietary intake, but simply because they have difficulty absorbing vitamin D from the gut. This can occur with people who suffer from conditions such as Crohn's or coeliac disease, or who have liver problems, as a result of alcoholism or otherwise. If you suffer from any of these conditions, discuss the issue of vitamin D supplementation with your doctor and try to assist your body by keeping active in the bright months. Just for comparison, the body can produce roughly 380IU vitamin D a day, from exposing just 1cm of skin in the summer - which just shows why we should encourage our children to play outside and advise carers to take someone vulnerable out of doors as much as possible. Even a walk in the park for half an hour on a regular basis can ensure the body's vitamin tanks are well stocked.</p>",

It is also National Impotence Day - a timely, and perhaps rather cruel, reminder that one man in 10 is consistently unable to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for the sex he desires. The advent of Viagra in 1998 has not changed the fact that erectile dysfunction (ED) - the medical term for impotence - remains one of the most common and distressing health problems affecting men in Britain today.</p> <p>Men with ED now have another reason to worry about their condition: it could be an important early-warning sign of heart disease, according to research recently presented to an American Heart Association conference.</p> <p>Dr Marc Pritzker, director of heart failure and transplantation at the Minneapolis Heart Foundation, examined 50 men with ED who had sought prescriptions for Viagra.

Overall, 40 per cent of the men were at significant risk of angina or a heart attack.</p> <p>'We now understand that atherosclerosis [the thickening and narrowing of blood vessels] detected in one set of blood vessels markedly increases the chances of having this form of blood-vessel disease in other areas of the body,' says Dr Pritzker.

Dr Pritzker believes erectile dysfunction could be called a 'penile stress test' and may be another way of detecting diseased blood vessels. Dr Pritzker, however, is quick to point out that 'we don't want every male who's running around with erectile dysfunction to think he's at risk of dropping dead from a heart attack'. He also freely admits that the 50 men he examined were already considered to be candidates for a cardiovascular disorder because there were no other obvious explanations for their erection problems and most of them had at least one other risk factor for heart disease, including smoking, high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. Still, he thinks that men should be aware: 'If you've been used to regular sexual activity and then things don't work as well, it's a sign that something might well be wrong.'</p> <p>Heart disease is not the only problem for which ED can be an early symptom.

Unfortunately, feelings of embarrassment or shame mean that men often wait a long time before seeing their GP.

Since July 1999, GPs have only been able to prescribe drug treatments on the NHS to men whose ED is caused by a limited range of specific conditions.

      "body": "<p>It's in bread, Marmite, beer. I like yeast. But not half so much as Dan Lepard and Jason Warwick. As senior bakers at the indescribably wonderful Baker &amp; Spice bakery in London's Mayfair (46 Walton Street, London SW3; 020 7589 4734), they speak of yeast as of a close friend or lover. 'It's getting a bit stressed, it needs a rest,' Lepard will say, tenderly gazing down at a doughy blob that looks like the Quatermas experiment.</p> <p>People get passionate about this stuff. And why not? Yeast has a life of its own. There is a company in the US which claims to sell cultures that have been continuously tended since antiquity. It was 6,000 years ago that the Egyptians discovered that adding beer froth to dough caused the mixture to rise. When the Romans landed in Britain, they found the Celts doing the same thing with the 'barm' from beer (hence the term 'barmy'). Louis Pasteur later established that carbon dioxide produced by fermenting sugar fungus is responsible for this miracle, and also for the distinctive acid-sour flavour of sourdough bread, which should be 'perfumed rather than pungent', according to Lepard.</p> <p>You can use commercially cultivated yeast, but this leads to a more nondescript finished product than if you use the naturally occurring 'wild' yeast in the air. When you make a 'starter' for one of Baker &amp; Spice's breads, what you're doing is trying to persuade this fickle yeast to settle and make a home on your dough. You entice it, seduce it, with things that it loves, such as malt, vitamin C, and perhaps a little Roberta Flack. If you create the right conditions, it'll stay with you for as long as you look after it, and will provide the basis of great bread forever.</p> <p>The most distinctive, basic bread Baker &amp; Spice produce is its thick-crusted, flavoursome pain au levain. The starter for this contains no more than wholemeal and strong white flour, water, honey and orange juice, with the later addition of salt and semolina to the finished article. The recipe is detailed in Lepard and Richard Whittington's indispensable Baker &amp; Spice: Baking with Passion (\u00a318.99, Quadrille), and looks easy as sin when you watch the experts do it. Or you can learn how to make croissants instead.</p> <p>Baker &amp; Spice's buttery croissants are meals in themselves. They use a drier dough than is traditional, for a crisper finish. We begin by mixing together one sachet of fast-action yeast (any brand will do), 100g of strong white flour (must be stone-ground: Dove's Farm organic, or Churchill's are recommended) and 110ml of warm, bottled water, then covering with clingfilm and leaving to stand for two hours. It rises by a third and is combined with the remaining ingredients: 400g of flour, 110ml cold milk, 20g fine-ground Maldon salt and 70g caster sugar. These can be mixed automatically, then kneaded by hand to develop the gluten. Fluency at kneading is more difficult to acquire than I'd expected. Push forward with the heel of your hand, fold in half, stand on end and push again, until you're terrifically bored. Now wrap the dough in clingfilm and leave overnight in the fridge.</p> <p>The rest of our lesson is conducted Blue Peter style, with dough that Lepard made earlier. A 250g pack of butter ('the best you've got, unsalted') is bashed between wrappers, with a rolling pin, into a flat, 1cm-thick rectangle, after which the dough is rolled into a similar, though much larger, 1cm-thick shape. The butter is then placed on the flat dough and the edges pulled over it, creating a smaller rectangular parcel. Each end is folded in by a quarter, so that they meet in the middle, then in half, as if closing a book. The resulting construction is then rolled out again and the process repeated, leaving a layered parcel which is to be sealed at the edges with pressure from the rolling pin, wrapped in clingfilm and refrigerated for a further hour.</p> <p>Flattened one final time, into a neat rectangle, approximately 75cm by 30cm, the pastry is cut into eight triangles and gently stretched lengthwise, before being rolled into crescents, inwards from the short side of the triangle. These are glazed with egg yolk and milk, baked in the centre of the oven at 200C for 10 minutes, then a further 20-25 at 150C.

      "bodyText": "It's in bread, Marmite, beer. I like yeast. But not half so much as Dan Lepard and Jason Warwick. As senior bakers at the indescribably wonderful Baker &amp; Spice bakery in London's Mayfair (46 Walton Street, London SW3; 020 7589 4734), they speak of yeast as of a close friend or lover. 'It's getting a bit stressed, it needs a rest,' Lepard will say, tenderly gazing down at a doughy blob that looks like the Quatermas experiment. People get passionate about this stuff. And why not? Yeast has a life of its own. There is a company in the US which claims to sell cultures that have been continuously tended since antiquity. It was 6,000 years ago that the Egyptians discovered that adding beer froth to dough caused the mixture to rise. When the Romans landed in Britain, they found the Celts doing the same thing with the 'barm' from beer (hence the term 'barmy'). Louis Pasteur later established that carbon dioxide produced by fermenting sugar fungus is responsible for this miracle, and also for the distinctive acid-sour flavour of sourdough bread, which should be 'perfumed rather than pungent', according to Lepard. You can use commercially cultivated yeast, but this leads to a more nondescript finished product than if you use the naturally occurring 'wild' yeast in the air. When you make a 'starter' for one of Baker &amp; Spice's breads, what you're doing is trying to persuade this fickle yeast to settle and make a home on your dough. You entice it, seduce it, with things that it loves, such as malt, vitamin C, and perhaps a little Roberta Flack. If you create the right conditions, it'll stay with you for as long as you look after it, and will provide the basis of great bread forever. The most distinctive, basic bread Baker &amp; Spice produce is its thick-crusted, flavoursome pain au levain. The starter for this contains no more than wholemeal and strong white flour, water, honey and orange juice, with the later addition of salt and semolina to the finished article. The recipe is detailed in Lepard and Richard Whittington's indispensable Baker &amp; Spice: Baking with Passion (\u00a318.99, Quadrille), and looks easy as sin when you watch the experts do it. Or you can learn how to make croissants instead. Baker &amp; Spice's buttery croissants are meals in themselves. They use a drier dough than is traditional, for a crisper finish. We begin by mixing together one sachet of fast-action yeast (any brand will do), 100g of strong white flour (must be stone-ground: Dove's Farm organic, or Churchill's are recommended) and 110ml of warm, bottled water, then covering with clingfilm and leaving to stand for two hours. It rises by a third and is combined with the remaining ingredients: 400g of flour, 110ml cold milk, 20g fine-ground Maldon salt and 70g caster sugar. These can be mixed automatically, then kneaded by hand to develop the gluten. Fluency at kneading is more difficult to acquire than I'd expected. Push forward with the heel of your hand, fold in half, stand on end and push again, until you're terrifically bored. Now wrap the dough in clingfilm and leave overnight in the fridge. The rest of our lesson is conducted Blue Peter style, with dough that Lepard made earlier. A 250g pack of butter ('the best you've got, unsalted') is bashed between wrappers, with a rolling pin, into a flat, 1cm-thick rectangle, after which the dough is rolled into a similar, though much larger, 1cm-thick shape. The butter is then placed on the flat dough and the edges pulled over it, creating a smaller rectangular parcel. Each end is folded in by a quarter, so that they meet in the middle, then in half, as if closing a book. The resulting construction is then rolled out again and the process repeated, leaving a layered parcel which is to be sealed at the edges with pressure from the rolling pin, wrapped in clingfilm and refrigerated for a further hour. Flattened one final time, into a neat rectangle, approximately 75cm by 30cm, the pastry is cut into eight triangles and gently stretched lengthwise, before being rolled into crescents, inwards from the short side of the triangle. These are glazed with egg yolk and milk, baked in the centre of the oven at 200C for 10 minutes, then a further 20-25 at 150C. Eaten warm, they unwind and melt deliciously in the mouth. I try some at home with the children, and they are not quite so delicate. Baking, I realise, takes practice. 'We get the bread we deserve,' Lepard observes, with a suggestion that we make a habit of requesting particular loaves from our local bakers. If your local bakery is anything like mine, wear a helmet when you do this. Bon appetit.",

I have smelled many things during this process, in the 20-odd weeks since the mantle of parenthood was thrust upon me - none of which deserves reference in a restaurant review - but I can safely say that cinnamon is not one of them. I wondered whether a trip to the paediatrician was in order. Doctor, my boy smells like a croissant from Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Manger. What should I do? Franchise him?

I have come across these things before, of course, but only in motorway service stations, or those Formica-and-polystyrene fast-food gaffs eagerly selling a cheap 'family experience' to desperate parents. Restaurateurs in Britain generally do not like small children. Sure, they will tolerate them, but only in as much as they will tolerate a headache or a cold. Real restaurants serving carefully cooked adult food which also welcome babies with open arms are few and very far between. The Tin Drum is one of them. To be fair, I didn't really need to try out the changing room to spot this. I could have worked it out from the clientele: every other table in the wide, airy room had a pram or pushchair standing sentry next to it. There was a pram at either end of ours - 11-month-old Lola asleep in one, five-month-old Eddie asleep in the other - and there was still room for everybody to move about.</p> <p>What's more, the high ceiling of the comfortably scuffed wood-floored room meant that the yelps and cries of even the most exuberant child were lost on the echo. If there is some connection in the decor of The Tin Drum to the G\u00fcnter Grass novel of the same name, it was not immediately apparent to me, though there is a wall of secondhand books which you can buy from a shop a couple of doors down if you find a title you wish to carry away with you. As to the food, it is good, solid, workmanlike stuff; not showy, and certainly not ambitious, but good enough to remind a new parent that they are still a person. Believe me, that is a rare enough pleasure. There is a Mittel European slant to it - so a dusting of paprika here, a little sour cream there - but for the most part, it is just bistro fare, sensibly and cheaply presented. My wife had the Polish fillet steak at \u00a36.50. It was perfectly cooked and came with a dollop of sour cream which, she announced, was such a good accompaniment to the meat that a tub of the stuff should henceforth take up residence in our fridge. Lola's dad had the pork schnitzel in a rich creamy sauce at \u00a37.95 (the most expensive dish on the short lunchtime menu). He, too, gave a satisfied thumbs up. Lola's mum and I both had the chicken and bacon salad. It was a straightforward piece of assembly, though the dressing was a little underpowered. I said as much to the waitress, and she swiftly brought me a jug of something a little more ballsy. All the dishes came with a heap of big chunky chips that were so crisp they rustled against each other when the plate was disturbed.</p> <p>For pudding, my wife had the pecan pie. She declared herself a little disappointed: it was more of a solid cake than the nut-and-caramel crusted tart we have become used to, and it came with a slick of cr\u00e8me anglaise rather than the ice cream she had asked for, but she was in a forgiving mood and somehow forced herself to finish the lot. I had the apple strudel, which was a good mix of sweet and sour. This time, the advertised ice cream did turn up. It was cinnamon flavour. In Proust's Remembrance of Things Past it is a Madeleine cake dipped in tea which transports a character back to his childhood; at the Tin Drum it was a scoop of cinnamon ice cream which transported me back to my son's bare bottom.

If there is some connection in the decor of The Tin Drum to the G\u00fcnter Grass novel of the same name, it was not immediately apparent to me, though there is a wall of secondhand books which you can buy from a shop a couple of doors down if you find a title you wish to carry away with you. As to the food, it is good, solid, workmanlike stuff; not showy, and certainly not ambitious, but good enough to remind a new parent that they are still a person. Believe me, that is a rare enough pleasure. There is a Mittel European slant to it - so a dusting of paprika here, a little sour cream there - but for the most part, it is just bistro fare, sensibly and cheaply presented. My wife had the Polish fillet steak at \u00a36.50. It was perfectly cooked and came with a dollop of sour cream which, she announced, was such a good accompaniment to the meat that a tub of the stuff should henceforth take up residence in our fridge. Lola's dad had the pork schnitzel in a rich creamy sauce at \u00a37.95 (the most expensive dish on the short lunchtime menu). He, too, gave a satisfied thumbs up. Lola's mum and I both had the chicken and bacon salad. It was a straightforward piece of assembly, though the dressing was a little underpowered. I said as much to the waitress, and she swiftly brought me a jug of something a little more ballsy. All the dishes came with a heap of big chunky chips that were so crisp they rustled against each other when the plate was disturbed. For pudding, my wife had the pecan pie. She declared herself a little disappointed: it was more of a solid cake than the nut-and-caramel crusted tart we have become used to, and it came with a slick of cr\u00e8me anglaise rather than the ice cream she had asked for, but she was in a forgiving mood and somehow forced herself to finish the lot. I had the apple strudel, which was a good mix of sweet and sour. This time, the advertised ice cream did turn up. It was cinnamon flavour. In Proust's Remembrance of Things Past it is a Madeleine cake dipped in tea which transports a character back to his childhood; at the Tin Drum it was a scoop of cinnamon ice cream which transported me back to my son's bare bottom. What an aid to digestion. \u0095 The Tin Drum, 95-97 Dyke Road, Brighton (01273 777575). Lunch for two, including drinks and service, \u00a335",

      "bodyText": "Messrs Reeves and McSmith fairly accurately described London's theft of the UK economy but then incorrectly claimed this cancer on the UK makes a disproportionately high economic contribution to the country (Focus, last week). This calculation ignores investment classed as 'national', hence the distortion of allocation of lottery funds, the unfair (and disastrous) allocation of millennial spending and the, much more important, concentration of government and company head offices in the capital. Not only does London rob the rest of the country of this investment it then forces people like me to subsidise it. Most the political problems posed by devolution, migration to the South-East and the growing North-South divide could be solved at a stroke - kick London and the South-East out of the UK. Roger Marston Craven Arms Salop There are two Londons. There is the London of the West End, the galleries and museums, the chic restaurants, the money and the power. Against this, there is the London where the inhabitants have never been to see a production in the West End, who will never set foot in an art gallery, who cannot afford to wine and dine in elegant restaurants, and who have little money, less power and to whom the first London seems like a different place with a distinct and alien culture. London vs Britain is a false argument. Inequality, in all forms, needs to be addressed and we must not mislead ourselves with 'red herring' debates. Andy Walsh Carlisle Yes, London is too dominant. Some redress could be achieved by moving parliament to a deprived, northern area. It would be followed by the civil service, much of the media, the middle-class think tanks, the lobbyists, and those who spent years currying favour to obtain top positions.

      "body": "<b>Neil Jordan</b> I'm not sure when and where we first met, but I do remember seeing him with a whole lot of other people in a pub on the Ball's Pond Road in Islington. The Duke of Wellington is a meeting place for Irish expats, with a theatre in the back room. I saw him in a production of a play by Tom Murphy called The Blue Macushla. It was done like a film noir, and directed by Jim Sheridan, and I thought Stephen had a remarkable cinematic quality, a great ability with silence. Most actors find it very hard to do nothing - that's my experience anyway. Later, when we did The Butcher Boy, there was the party scene, and it was like a battle of lessness. Stephen was doing so little; and all the other actors were trying to do as little as Stephen, but they actually couldn't manage it. <p>I deliberately wrote the screenplay Angel with him in mind. Well, it was about the north of Ireland, where he's from. And it worked, because he had the courage to carry the meaning of the film. He's wonderful to work with, a delightful person and he gives a deeply considered performance. When you watch the rushes of a day's filming, the sum of what he's doing is not always evident. It's only later that his full scope emerges; he has a unique way of carrying the intelligence of a movie.</p> <p>Angel was the first Irish feature film with an Irish crew - rather than American. It was the early 80s, which was a very black time with all those sectarian murders. I used to play in a band, and we would perform at Queen's University in Belfast and drive back at night, which was quite scary because the road would be blocked off. A band was actually killed. </p> <p>You always thought that musicians were like sports personalities or circus performers - immune to violent conflict. So that put the idea in my mind for this person Danny, who Stephen played, who gets drawn into the conflict. I didn't plan to keep casting Stephen, but it kept happening. Once you work with people you like, you work with them again, if you're lucky enough to get them. In The Butcher Boy, he plays the part of the father, which on the face of it is quite small, but I can't think of another actor who would have the nous to realise that it's the commanding role, the binding one. He brought a great sense of comedy to those voice-overs. He has a great gift for comedy which I haven't been able to utilise because I'm not that kind of writer.</p> <p>We offered the part of Henry, the cuckolded civil servant in The End of the Affair [at cinemas nationwide], to a whole lot of people and they all got offended. I suppose there's not much for an actor to latch on to in the role. But when you can take something as insubstantial as that, when you can make an unglamorous man live, it's far more of an achievement. Stephen turned it down initially and I asked him to read the part again. I felt that there was more to it than he thought. After talking to him, I did develop the dignity of the role towards the end of the film. A relationship with an actor does affect the writing. Stephen is a very private person and highly politicised. His choice of work is proof of that. I know that fatherhood is hugely important to him and that he's devoted to his two sons, Danny and Oscar. You can just tell from watching them together. Our kids socialise a bit. We also used to own a racehorse together called Christie's Picnic. It lost a lot of races. We got another one called Butcher Boy which won nothing, as well.</p> <p>I certainly want to work with him again, but there's nothing in the pipeline right now. I'd actually like him to direct a film. In a way, he's too bright to be an actor. If you've got the intelligence to see beyond your role, then at a certain stage acting can become unsatisfying\u0085 I know that's a terrible thing to say. </p> <p><b>Stephen Rea</b> I think we first met some time between 1978 and 1980. We were part of the same literary crowd. I just knew him as a writer of amazing short stories - they have as strong an atmosphere as James Joyces's Dubliners and they're every bit as cinematic. We went for a drink, after he saw a show I was in, and later he gave me the screenplay of Angel to read.</p> <p>When you look at Angel everything is there, in place, right from the beginning. Oscar Wilde said that only mediocrity improves, and in a sense his work is the same now, except that his ability to compose shots and control the experience for the audience has developed a lot. </p> <p>As a person, he's only changed in that he's become much more open socially. He used to be desperately shy. So much so that it was sometimes difficult to know what he was talking about; he would start in the middle of a sentence. Still, he has enormous confidence in his own ability, in the importance of his vision, which I envy. Our backgrounds are very different. His father was a teacher, who made him read a lot, and his mother was an artist. My father was a bus driver, so I don't think it was as great a leap for Neil to write as it was for me to act.</p> <p>He writes his own screenplays so you don't have to waste time begging him to understand the writing in the way that you have to with some directors who aren't writers. I'm always amazed that he allows actors to change the script. Sometimes, I think what he wrote was better.</p> <p>We don't work together in a planned way. He'll amble along and say, 'I'm doing this thing. Do you feel like\u0085' or 'you should be in this,' or 'the script is written. What do you want to do?' </p> <p>In The Crying Game, I played Fergus, an IRA man. We made the film in 1992, which was a very dark time in Northern Ireland, and a lot of people were angry that I portrayed an IRA man as a human being. It would have been good if Fergus's colleagues had been played in a more rounded way, too. But our perspectives on Northern Ireland are different. I grew up in Belfast, while he grew up around the same time in Clontarf, north of Dublin. His Ireland had a lot of poverty and repression, but it was relatively peaceful. His attitude to the border is similar to that of a lot of people living in southern Ireland, in that they couldn't care less about it, whereas I do care. </p> <p>When Neil first talked to me about The Crying Game, he didn't send me a script, he told me the story over dinner. He wanted to see my reaction when he said those words 'She's a man'. My jaw dropped and I wanted to roar with laughter, just as the audience in the cinema do. </p> <p>Neil's work has been a substantial part of my career. I've done 24 films in all, but not many that are as good as his.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Mortimer claims that the Government's decision to exclude the Countryside Alliance from a Downing Street gathering on rural Britain was 'like having a party for theatricals and failing to invite anyone from the Royal Shakespeare Company' (Comment, last week). In reality, I would contend, it was like rather failing to invite the Cheam Players or the Lyminge Amateur Dramatic Society. The Countryside Alliance (n\u00e9e British Field Sports Society) has nothing to contribute to the countryside debate, other than a desire to retain a leisure activity which involves setting a pack of dogs on a wild mammal for personal gratification. And yet the Alliance claims that it represents all of rural Britain. As the RSC never said: 'Is this a blagger I see before me?' Mike Baker International Fund for Animal Welfare London SE1 I could imagine John Mortimer drinking warm beer while watching a cricket match, when he wrote the piece which appeared in your paper on Sunday. He should visit the once mining villages of Easington and Dawdon among many others in East Durham, or Ashington in Northumberland, or Consett in West Durham to temper his enthusiasm for the rural glades of the Chilterns. There are quite a few families who have lived in this area for 70 years who have also suffered from government neglect. They cannot sell a Land Rover or two to make ends meet or let cottages to weekenders. Stick to writing humorous stories about the law Mr Mortimer and leave the economics to Messrs Blair and Brown. They are doing quite well at the moment thank you! R.A. Golightly East Boldon Tyne &amp; Wear John Mortimer blames rural decline on many things including what he describes as the previous government's mishandling of the BSE crisis. No matter how many times this is repeated and no matter how many chocolate \u00e9clairs are thrown at Ministers, the fact remains that no government ever ordered any farmer to feed the remains of dead animals to cows, the classic herbivores. Unnatural practices in agriculture tend to produce some very unnatural consequences. Brian P. Moss Tamworth Staffs Your reports last week showed up the insane distribution of resources in contemporary Britain. Jamie Doward estimated that the City advisers to Vodaphone in its takeover of Mannersmann have 'earned' about \u00a3400m (Business, last week). John Mortimer reports that the Government is not willing to find \u00a3350 million to match European Union funding for farmers hit by the gyrations of the world agricultural markets (Comment, last week). In my local area, \u00a3400m would roughly double the incomes of the entire population of West Newcastle for two years. But such beneficial transfers are unthinkable in Blair's Britain.

Minutes later, he's trying to rewrite the code for a university homepage, scribbling his name on the title page to prove his presence. </p> <p>'Tips on how to break into websites are all over the Internet,' he says. 'There are bulletin boards for them, discussion groups, chat rooms and web magazines. Almost all of them say the information is to be used solely for self-protection - rubbish. It's all there to be used.' </p> <p>Dread is 27, single, and working in the IT industry. His main targets are university sites. His motivation, he explains, is the sheer pleasure of knowing he can break into a site. Others have a more dangerous sense of mischief. </p> <p>The Internet, with its emphasis on free speech, undoubtedly encourages subversive behaviour and also provides access to hacking methodology. </p> <p>One revolutionary arm of the Internet is the bulletin board, where users swap gossip and expertise. Regularly updated information allows hackers to beat latest security measures. </p> <p>One bulletin board tells how to retrieve emails from Hotmail accounts. The instructions are easily discovered and downloaded and easy for even novice hackers to understand. Last year, Hotmail's global service was disrupted for five hours when hackers broke in, and closed it down. The ease with which even elaborate servers are infiltrated is worrying to those trying to implement security. 'Online security must be a priority for companies wanting to trade on the Internet,' says Jason Wu, head of NetFront Communications, a California-based security firm that provides privacy for firms who do business on the Internet. </p> <p>'Most of the hackers who have penetrated websites this week are amateurs,' he continues.

Minutes later, he's trying to rewrite the code for a university homepage, scribbling his name on the title page to prove his presence. 'Tips on how to break into websites are all over the Internet,' he says. 'There are bulletin boards for them, discussion groups, chat rooms and web magazines. Almost all of them say the information is to be used solely for self-protection - rubbish. It's all there to be used.' Dread is 27, single, and working in the IT industry. His main targets are university sites. His motivation, he explains, is the sheer pleasure of knowing he can break into a site. Others have a more dangerous sense of mischief. The Internet, with its emphasis on free speech, undoubtedly encourages subversive behaviour and also provides access to hacking methodology. One revolutionary arm of the Internet is the bulletin board, where users swap gossip and expertise. Regularly updated information allows hackers to beat latest security measures. One bulletin board tells how to retrieve emails from Hotmail accounts. The instructions are easily discovered and downloaded and easy for even novice hackers to understand. Last year, Hotmail's global service was disrupted for five hours when hackers broke in, and closed it down. The ease with which even elaborate servers are infiltrated is worrying to those trying to implement security. 'Online security must be a priority for companies wanting to trade on the Internet,' says Jason Wu, head of NetFront Communications, a California-based security firm that provides privacy for firms who do business on the Internet. 'Most of the hackers who have penetrated websites this week are amateurs,' he continues. 'None of them has resurfaced to boast about their exploits and successes, which is really how professionals make a reputation for themselves. These hackers don't seem to have any agenda either. They just want to shut down the Internet to other people.' But these 'script kiddies' are increasingly chasing monetary gain.

      "body": "<p>The most heart-wrenching sight in America is suddenly the stuff of raw electoral politics, as John McCain and George W. Bush face off in the South Carolina primary and in the increasingly thrilling contest beyond.</p> <p>It happens many times every day: an elderly couple - or maybe a mother and son or daughter - descend the ramp alongside The Wall of Silent Names that is the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC, almost suffocating at its deepest point. They are given a piece of tracing paper, a crayon, an envelope and maybe a step ladder, and find one of those engraved names, all that remains of a loved one lost decades ago. They rub the name on to the paper, linger awhile staring at that piece of wall, then they climb - solemnly, sometimes tearfully - back up the ramp, clutching the envelope.</p> <p>The Vietnam gash is America's deepest and unhealed wound, but has been politically sidelined until this election, when a convergence of factors has brought Nam back into frame. This time around, the veterans and those families whom the dead left behind at The Wall are vital political statistics. One factor is John McCain's remarkable Vietnam record of courage in the face of torture - especially as contrasted with that of Bush, who dodged the war with help from his father to sit around as a National Guardsman in Texas. McCain is trying all he can to translate his life story into votes.</p> <p>But the McCain mutiny is in turn symptomatic of something which cuts much deeper: a growing popular conviction that the Vietnam War was, after all, a just war, that its veterans and bereaved families should be vindicated not reviled, that the peacenik Sixties got it wrong.</p> <p>It is a mood-swing ex-pressed in a new book by anti-war Democrat Michael Lind, the title of which speaks for itself: Vietnam: The Necessary War. Maybe not The Good War - as Studs Terkel's cult book described World War II - but getting better.</p> <p>The veterans of Nam now targeted by McCain were, most of them, the poor from the prairies, mountains and ghettoes who returned to face the hatred of the military establishment for losing and of the liberals for having gone in the first place. They watched 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda marry a media mogul and draft-dodger Bill Clinton become President.</p> <p>But now, says Rand Lewis, a veteran who teaches Vietnam classes at Idaho University, 'finally, after all these years, the American public has accepted the veterans back into the fold'. Not only that, but they have a presidential candidate from among their own.</p> <p>McCain is now a serious politician and has done the mathematics. There are 8.5 million veterans of Vietnam-age or younger. Three million of them served in Vietnam, of whom 300,000 were wounded like him. South Carolina boasts the heaviest concentration per capita: 450,000 vets - 10 per cent of the state's population (second is New Hampshire). If they all voted for McCain, he would need no one else.</p> <p>And if he can win South Carolina on 19 February, McCain's campaign goes truly national - to all those tens of thousands of places where the black flag of the veterans and 'POW/MIA' (prisoner of war/missing in action) movements flies from city hall or state Capitol.</p> <p>So McCain's election poster shows not the present-day, bouncy candidate in very late middle age but a strikingly handsome young Navy pilot in full flying regalia with the ironic slogan 'McCain 2000' beneath. On the podium in Sunter, South Carolina, McCain thunders: 'How are we going to get a future generation of Americans to serve, if we don't look after those who already have?'</p> <p>McCain has named veterans co-ordinators in each of South Carolina's counties, all reporting to a retired colonel, Phil Butler. McCain's latest leaflet, sent to every registered war veteran in South Carolina (with all other primary states to follow) addresses his former comrades thus: 'I Ask You To Join Me In One Last Mission.'</p> <p>The crucial questions are: Will they? And: Who else will join McCain on that last mission, but who never picked up a gun?</p> <p>Richard Quinn, McCain's strategist in South Carolina, presumes it 'likely' that 'a person who has a military background will vote for McCain'.</p> <p>And yet the veterans are many and their vote is not monolithic. Even Colonel Butler concedes that 'we probably don't have as much of the veteran vote as we should'. Now Bush must confront the veteran vote and fight for it - without seeming to fight McCain. This is perilous territory for Bush, after revelations that once his military service alibi in higher education had expired, a carefully placed phone call by his father enabled the young Harvard 'Frat Brat' to jump a queue of 100,000 and join the safety of the Texas National Guard while those whose votes he now seeks were out in the killing fields.</p> <p>But Bush's machine in conservative South Carolina has found the way of selling its non-veteran candidate to veterans: you call his rival a bleeding-heart liberal. 'McCain is a Democrat-lite,' says Wayne Crockfield, a disabled veteran who sits on the local anti-abortion committee and dislikes McCain's 'flip-flops' on the issue.</p> <p>Because McCain is also a veteran, many vets hold him to higher standards than other candidates, or have higher expectations to disappoint. Many in the powerful POW/MIA movement - which believes successive administrations have connived to betray remaining prisoners and missing comrades - object to McCain's push to improve relations with Communist Vietnam and even accuse him of a 'cover-up'. One MIA activist website in Kansas posits that McCain was brainwashed by his captors into maintaining a rapport with Hanoi.</p> <p>But veterans like Jim Skinner of Orgeon, who made a peacemaking journey to Hanoi last year and 'liked the beer they got there', applaud McCain's efforts. 'It's time to shake hands and move on,' says James McKinnon, a vice-commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars association, a McCain man.</p> <p>So Bush should tread carefully through the dichotomy of the veterans' hawkery and their maturity. But in Florence, South Carolina, last week he blundered in what may be remembered as a seminal moment in the campaign; he tried to touch an American nerve, and sliced it instead.</p> <p>Bush fielded Thomas Burch Jnr, chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, who accused McCain of failing his kind - opposing measures to deal with Agent Orange poisoning, and legislation to help families of those whom veterans hold sacred, the 'POW/MIA' boys. 'He came home,' said Burch, a Vietnam veteran, 'and forgot us.' Burch's attack backfired. The response from the veteran movment was one of outrage. Edward Timperlake, Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Affairs in the Administration of Bush's own father, said: 'Attacking John McCain on veterans' affairs is wrong. It's over the line.' Five senators (one a Republican) wrote a furious letter expressing 'dismay' and demanding an apology to McCain.</p> <p>McCain spoke only of the letter's authors: 'Their friendship is all the honour I need in my life, and more than compensates for the temporary irritation of baseless attacks by apparently desperate political campaigns.'</p> <p>Until Florence, analysts had seen a possibility of Bush maybe inviting McCain to be his running mate one day soon, but not now.</p>",

It happens many times every day: an elderly couple - or maybe a mother and son or daughter - descend the ramp alongside The Wall of Silent Names that is the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC, almost suffocating at its deepest point. They are given a piece of tracing paper, a crayon, an envelope and maybe a step ladder, and find one of those engraved names, all that remains of a loved one lost decades ago. They rub the name on to the paper, linger awhile staring at that piece of wall, then they climb - solemnly, sometimes tearfully - back up the ramp, clutching the envelope. The Vietnam gash is America's deepest and unhealed wound, but has been politically sidelined until this election, when a convergence of factors has brought Nam back into frame. This time around, the veterans and those families whom the dead left behind at The Wall are vital political statistics. One factor is John McCain's remarkable Vietnam record of courage in the face of torture - especially as contrasted with that of Bush, who dodged the war with help from his father to sit around as a National Guardsman in Texas. McCain is trying all he can to translate his life story into votes. But the McCain mutiny is in turn symptomatic of something which cuts much deeper: a growing popular conviction that the Vietnam War was, after all, a just war, that its veterans and bereaved families should be vindicated not reviled, that the peacenik Sixties got it wrong. It is a mood-swing ex-pressed in a new book by anti-war Democrat Michael Lind, the title of which speaks for itself: Vietnam: The Necessary War. Maybe not The Good War - as Studs Terkel's cult book described World War II - but getting better. The veterans of Nam now targeted by McCain were, most of them, the poor from the prairies, mountains and ghettoes who returned to face the hatred of the military establishment for losing and of the liberals for having gone in the first place. They watched 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda marry a media mogul and draft-dodger Bill Clinton become President. But now, says Rand Lewis, a veteran who teaches Vietnam classes at Idaho University, 'finally, after all these years, the American public has accepted the veterans back into the fold'. Not only that, but they have a presidential candidate from among their own. McCain is now a serious politician and has done the mathematics. There are 8.5 million veterans of Vietnam-age or younger. Three million of them served in Vietnam, of whom 300,000 were wounded like him. South Carolina boasts the heaviest concentration per capita: 450,000 vets - 10 per cent of the state's population (second is New Hampshire). If they all voted for McCain, he would need no one else. And if he can win South Carolina on 19 February, McCain's campaign goes truly national - to all those tens of thousands of places where the black flag of the veterans and 'POW/MIA' (prisoner of war/missing in action) movements flies from city hall or state Capitol. So McCain's election poster shows not the present-day, bouncy candidate in very late middle age but a strikingly handsome young Navy pilot in full flying regalia with the ironic slogan 'McCain 2000' beneath. On the podium in Sunter, South Carolina, McCain thunders: 'How are we going to get a future generation of Americans to serve, if we don't look after those who already have?' McCain has named veterans co-ordinators in each of South Carolina's counties, all reporting to a retired colonel, Phil Butler. McCain's latest leaflet, sent to every registered war veteran in South Carolina (with all other primary states to follow) addresses his former comrades thus: 'I Ask You To Join Me In One Last Mission.' The crucial questions are: Will they? And: Who else will join McCain on that last mission, but who never picked up a gun? Richard Quinn, McCain's strategist in South Carolina, presumes it 'likely' that 'a person who has a military background will vote for McCain'. And yet the veterans are many and their vote is not monolithic. Even Colonel Butler concedes that 'we probably don't have as much of the veteran vote as we should'. Now Bush must confront the veteran vote and fight for it - without seeming to fight McCain. This is perilous territory for Bush, after revelations that once his military service alibi in higher education had expired, a carefully placed phone call by his father enabled the young Harvard 'Frat Brat' to jump a queue of 100,000 and join the safety of the Texas National Guard while those whose votes he now seeks were out in the killing fields. But Bush's machine in conservative South Carolina has found the way of selling its non-veteran candidate to veterans: you call his rival a bleeding-heart liberal. 'McCain is a Democrat-lite,' says Wayne Crockfield, a disabled veteran who sits on the local anti-abortion committee and dislikes McCain's 'flip-flops' on the issue. Because McCain is also a veteran, many vets hold him to higher standards than other candidates, or have higher expectations to disappoint. Many in the powerful POW/MIA movement - which believes successive administrations have connived to betray remaining prisoners and missing comrades - object to McCain's push to improve relations with Communist Vietnam and even accuse him of a 'cover-up'. One MIA activist website in Kansas posits that McCain was brainwashed by his captors into maintaining a rapport with Hanoi. But veterans like Jim Skinner of Orgeon, who made a peacemaking journey to Hanoi last year and 'liked the beer they got there', applaud McCain's efforts. 'It's time to shake hands and move on,' says James McKinnon, a vice-commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars association, a McCain man. So Bush should tread carefully through the dichotomy of the veterans' hawkery and their maturity. But in Florence, South Carolina, last week he blundered in what may be remembered as a seminal moment in the campaign; he tried to touch an American nerve, and sliced it instead. Bush fielded Thomas Burch Jnr, chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, who accused McCain of failing his kind - opposing measures to deal with Agent Orange poisoning, and legislation to help families of those whom veterans hold sacred, the 'POW/MIA' boys. 'He came home,' said Burch, a Vietnam veteran, 'and forgot us.' Burch's attack backfired. The response from the veteran movment was one of outrage. Edward Timperlake, Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Affairs in the Administration of Bush's own father, said: 'Attacking John McCain on veterans' affairs is wrong. It's over the line.' Five senators (one a Republican) wrote a furious letter expressing 'dismay' and demanding an apology to McCain. McCain spoke only of the letter's authors: 'Their friendship is all the honour I need in my life, and more than compensates for the temporary irritation of baseless attacks by apparently desperate political campaigns.' Until Florence, analysts had seen a possibility of Bush maybe inviting McCain to be his running mate one day soon, but not now.",

At 15 I was unpopular, fat and geeky. I hated my school photo so much I hid the copies from my family. But it wasn't just my spots and greasy hair I detested. I was convinced that anyone getting a really close look at me would divine my secret - that I was 'mo', to use the school slang. That when I gazed at my classmates' muddy bodies in the showers after football I experienced a surge of testosterone so powerful I would shake with desire.</p> <p>I wasn't wrong about the need for secrecy. At my single-sex grammar, the slightest wobble on the tightrope of masculinity would render you an outcast. I will never forget the delighted hiss of indrawn breath when, in an unguarded moment, I addressed one of my classmates as 'darling'. Filled with a need as unconquerable as it was inadmissible, I took to cycling down to the toilet after school, having become intrigued a year or two earlier by the penises drawn on the wall. Inside was a society behind society. I would wait in a queue of men old enough to be my teachers for one of the two cubicles to become vacant. There was a hole between them you could slip your hand through.</p> <p>I progressed from shyly looking to caressing till, at 17, in another Kingston toilet, I allowed a slim black man to bugger me. I want to emphasise I wasn't mad, drugged, deprived or abused. I came from one of those rare families that actually did consist of a mum, dad, son and daughter. My dad was a head teacher and my mum was at the BBC; they were broadminded by the standards of Sixties suburbia.</p> <p>There was only one reason I behaved like an outcast - because I was one. I doubt if I would behave any differently today unless I had enough confidence to venture into a gay bar alone. And if I was growing up in Plymouth, Perth or Portadown? Well, there ain't many around anyway.</p> <p>By some miracle, I never caught the clap (today it would be HIV) or got raped. But while friends were learning to splice the messy urges of sex into the rituals of courtship, my sexuality was hermetically sealed off from any kind of social relations. The result was an inability to unite sex with friendship that persisted till my mid-thirties. But at least my ravenous need for sex meant there was one part of me I couldn't deny, thank goodness, unlike those who repress it altogether until they're married or middle-aged.</p> <p>A few years ago I revisited the bricked-up toilet. I imagined my 15-year-old self still imprisoned there. If Section 28 stays on the statute book, it will keep teenagers like the one I was locked in there. Not because they're innately sleazy and want to be there. Not because they need therapy or a good talk with Jesus. But because in black and white, with the full force of law, Section 28 declares what young gays already believe - that they are irreparably second-rate human beings.</p> <p>It is a devastatingly concise and simple piece of slander. It consists of one Lie and one Insult. The Lie is that you can 'promote' homosexuality. It says kids don't turn gay unless they're told it's OK. It says that what homosexuals most want is that there should be more homosexuals, and that they must be stopped. It says that promoting repression is better than promoting happiness.</p> <p>The truth is, of course, the exact opposite. Teenage sexuality has to have the force of an Armalite to counteract the tyranny of gender models. God, how I tried not to be gay. I remember a foursome when my friend Michael paired me off with one of his girlfriend's mates. I manfully snogged her in the cinema, dying from embarrassment and distaste. I even tried to warp my own mind when, finding myself quite unable to keep Davy Jones of the Monkees out of my sexual fantasies, I got as far as grafting women's breasts on to his imagined body.</p> <p>The Insult is that gay relationships are 'pretend'. That the ad hoc families we build on the quicksand of our own needs, instead of the rock of social ritual, are thereby irredeemably fake. I bought this one hook, line and sinker. By university I'd come out and had got as far as a callow rebelliousness about being gay. Romantic love, I spouted, was a bourgeois fiction.</p> <p>But just after university, at 22, I met Eamon, an 18-year-old cockney-Irish chippy, at a party. He had blazing blue eyes and the sexiest voice in the world. We spent the night snuggled in the same sleeping bag, on the floor among the fag butts, oblivious of other people's comments. He chucked me after six months, tiring of my unhappy, compulsive promiscuity.</p> <p>The night he left, I experienced an overpowering blast of emotion I'd only ever read about before in Women's Own .

      "body": "<p>When Peter Mandelson resigned last year, after remembering that he had forgotten about the funding arrangements of his mortgage, no one passed comment on the colour of his shoes. When Geoffrey Robinson went on the Today programme last month to defend his reputation, no one complained about his tone of voice. When Tony Blair makes a blunder during Prime Minister's Question Time, no one would dream of suggesting that the trouble might have something to do with the fact that he was a father-of-three 'with another on the way'. But if it is a woman in the hot seat, you can expect to hear about nothing else.</p> <p>If it's not her credentials as a mother that are found wanting, it's her selfish decision not to have any children. If it's not her selfish decision to forgo children, it's her shoes. If it's not her shoes, it's her dress size, her taste in wallpaper, and the state of her hair. If she has a high voice, she's too silly. If she has a low voice, she's too much like a man. The higher her profile, the pettier the complaints. No matter how big her job is, it will be her personality that people argue about.</p> <p>And when she fails? It's more of the same, as we saw this week in the press post mortem of Jennie Page's career at the Dome. For some, Page had failed because she didn't have children, and so didn't know how to make the Dome a place they liked. For others, it was her management style: she was 'awkward, rude and impossible to deal with'. For Stephen Bayley, the Dome's original interior designer, her tragic flaw was that she lacked the 'bravery and style' to stand up for her own ideas.</p> <p>In his poison-pen portrait in the Mail on Sunday, he portrayed her as a toady run amok: 'There was never any doubt that Jennie Page, a driven, focused, frenetic woman, would do everything necessary to get the Dome finished on time and budget. This \"everything\" included an astonishing disdain of other people which took the form of (a) ignoring expert advice and (b) an unreflective willingness to chew up and dispose of individuals who got in the way.'</p> <p>The headline for this article was 'A Noisy Mouse Who Presided Over a Disgrace.' Page, says Bayley, was 'a noisy mouse, no slave to fitness or fashion'. But other papers gave her a glossier image. In the Daily Telegraph, she is the 'Empress of the Dome'. It is hard to imagine a real-life woman who could come across as an empress and a mouse. But it is very rare to read a news report about a very important sacked or about-to-be-sacked woman in which she is not portrayed as an unstable marriage of unhappy opposites. Consider former gas industry watchdog chief Clare Spottiswoode. She stepped down as Ofgas boss when news broke of an extra-marital affair, and was called Boadicea, Annie Oakley, Mumsy, and 'Ingrid Bergman on a bad hair day'. To say that one woman could be all of these things, is to suggest that she is suffering from multiple personality disorder.</p> <p>Just think of the job the press did on Harriet Harman. When she was in the Cabinet, and especially when she came under attack for reducing income support levels for lone parents, she was portrayed as cold, steely and heartless. But after she lost out in the reshuffle, the tabloids portrayed her as a cold, steely and heartless woman who was also a crybaby. Poor Harriet, they said. She just didn't have what it took. Blair's 'golden girl' had bitten off more than she could chew.</p> <p>They gave a similar moral to the Nicola Horlick story. She became a celebrity not because she lost a power struggle at Morgan Grenfell, but because her high-powered career had not stopped her having five children. The tabloids dubbed her the female Icarus. She failed because she had flown too close to the sun, overestimating her abilities. 'We never called her Superwoman,' a former colleague told the Daily Mail, 'we called her Brenda like the Queen.' But now that she had been shown to be an emotional toddler, her career was doomed.</p> <p>At no point during these 'so farewell then' rituals does anyone say: 'This woman cannot be trusted with power because she is a woman.' Instead, her critics seek to disqualify her by saying she is muddled, spineless, childish, wishy-washy. This is not to say that men in disgrace don't face caricature and harsh criticism, too. But there is a big difference between the sort of coverage Geoffrey Robinson has had and the coverage Mo Mowlam has been getting since her return from Northern Ireland. The question marks around Robinson concern his performance and his conduct, Mowlam's concern the very quality of her mind. Robinson's story is grounded in events; Mowlam's is grounded in a Westminster whispering campaign.</p> <p>Rumours persist that the radiotherapy she received in 1997 for a benign brain tumour has left her 'without the intellectual rigour to do her job'. Some feared that she has 'lost the plot'. Others are alleged to have confessed they are 'uneasy' around her. Any reader who accepted such vicious slander at face value would not be inclined to ask why David Trimble, the only named critic in the story, might have put pressure on Blair to replace Mowlam with someone who was a 'more serious politician'. Perhaps that was the point of the exercise.</p> <p>As smear campaigns go, it is still a pretty subtle one. Can this be taken as a sign of progress? In 1997, Women in Journalism did a research project in which it compared the coverage given to Alan Howarth when he left the Tories for New Labour, with the coverage given to Emma Nicholson when she left the Tories for the Lib Dems only a few weeks later. The differences were stark. While Howarth was portrayed as a man of vision acting on his conscience, Nicholson was described as witch-like and menopausal. Even in straight news stories, her decision was described as vengeful, petty and petulant. These same stories described her appearance and her family connections many column inches before they bothered to mention what she had achieved in her own career.</p> <p>When the research was published, Alan Howarth himself was one of the first to say how appalling it was that Nicholson had been treated so unfairly. The quality press took the criticism just as seriously. According to Ann Treneman, one of the authors, the report did make most quality papers pay closer attention to the way in which they portrayed prominent women. She points out that last week's coverage of Jennie Page is not about her appearance, but about the quality of her performance and the size of her pay-off. In this regard, she is getting the same treatment that you'd expect a man to get. If it had been a man in her job, if this man had weathered the same series of misfortunes, he would be expecting to get the sack around about now, too.</p> <p>But according to Eve Pollard, once the editor of the Sunday Express, and herself a victim of more than a few tabloid treatments, we should not assume from this that prominent women are any closer to getting fair and equal coverage. Because there are still so very few women at the top, she says, they attract excess, and often adverse, media attention at every stage in their careers. Thus, Anita Roddick is a controversial household name and face while the many men who run companies of comparable size remain anonymous. There is safety in anonymity and in numbers. When a man gets the sack, he can expect some colleagues will stand up for him. But a prominent woman who gets the sack has no club of women to fall back on.</p> <p>As for the things her former colleagues have been saying, they tell you a lot less about Page's performance than they do about their reluctance to accept her as a figure of authority. 'If a man gives an order, they call him assertive,' Pollard says. 'When a man is arrogant, we say he's decisive. But if a woman gives the same order, she is abrupt and lacks people skills. They want us to be soft and fluffy. But if they give you a job, they also want results. So how are you to do this while being fluffy? What did they expect Jennie Page to say? \"Can you possibly get something to me somewhere around 31 December, it's really up to you, darling\".'</p> <p>Pollard is certain that the smear campaigns are not effective. 'Other women are enormously supportive. They quite like the idea that you are out there and when they read the stuff about how impossible you are, they say, what nonsense.' It is still worth noting that in almost all of the most recent cases the failure of the women in question is attributed to 'strange decisions', as with Elizabeth Esteve Coll when she left the V and A; or 'inappropriate behaviour', as with Mary Allen when she left the Royal Opera House; or a 'ruthless' and 'aggressive' management style, as with Ann Iverson when she left Laura Ashley, Jill Barad when she left Barbie, and Jennie Page. All these criticisms suggest critics who are deeply ambivalent about women with power, not to mention a future in which more women might have more of it. So it's little wonder that they fall over themselves with excitement every time one of these vexing creatures slips up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Peter Mandelson resigned last year, after remembering that he had forgotten about the funding arrangements of his mortgage, no one passed comment on the colour of his shoes. When Geoffrey Robinson went on the Today programme last month to defend his reputation, no one complained about his tone of voice. When Tony Blair makes a blunder during Prime Minister's Question Time, no one would dream of suggesting that the trouble might have something to do with the fact that he was a father-of-three 'with another on the way'. But if it is a woman in the hot seat, you can expect to hear about nothing else. If it's not her credentials as a mother that are found wanting, it's her selfish decision not to have any children. If it's not her selfish decision to forgo children, it's her shoes. If it's not her shoes, it's her dress size, her taste in wallpaper, and the state of her hair. If she has a high voice, she's too silly. If she has a low voice, she's too much like a man. The higher her profile, the pettier the complaints. No matter how big her job is, it will be her personality that people argue about. And when she fails? It's more of the same, as we saw this week in the press post mortem of Jennie Page's career at the Dome. For some, Page had failed because she didn't have children, and so didn't know how to make the Dome a place they liked. For others, it was her management style: she was 'awkward, rude and impossible to deal with'. For Stephen Bayley, the Dome's original interior designer, her tragic flaw was that she lacked the 'bravery and style' to stand up for her own ideas. In his poison-pen portrait in the Mail on Sunday, he portrayed her as a toady run amok: 'There was never any doubt that Jennie Page, a driven, focused, frenetic woman, would do everything necessary to get the Dome finished on time and budget. This \"everything\" included an astonishing disdain of other people which took the form of (a) ignoring expert advice and (b) an unreflective willingness to chew up and dispose of individuals who got in the way.' The headline for this article was 'A Noisy Mouse Who Presided Over a Disgrace.' Page, says Bayley, was 'a noisy mouse, no slave to fitness or fashion'. But other papers gave her a glossier image. In the Daily Telegraph, she is the 'Empress of the Dome'. It is hard to imagine a real-life woman who could come across as an empress and a mouse. But it is very rare to read a news report about a very important sacked or about-to-be-sacked woman in which she is not portrayed as an unstable marriage of unhappy opposites. Consider former gas industry watchdog chief Clare Spottiswoode. She stepped down as Ofgas boss when news broke of an extra-marital affair, and was called Boadicea, Annie Oakley, Mumsy, and 'Ingrid Bergman on a bad hair day'. To say that one woman could be all of these things, is to suggest that she is suffering from multiple personality disorder. Just think of the job the press did on Harriet Harman. When she was in the Cabinet, and especially when she came under attack for reducing income support levels for lone parents, she was portrayed as cold, steely and heartless. But after she lost out in the reshuffle, the tabloids portrayed her as a cold, steely and heartless woman who was also a crybaby. Poor Harriet, they said. She just didn't have what it took. Blair's 'golden girl' had bitten off more than she could chew. They gave a similar moral to the Nicola Horlick story. She became a celebrity not because she lost a power struggle at Morgan Grenfell, but because her high-powered career had not stopped her having five children. The tabloids dubbed her the female Icarus. She failed because she had flown too close to the sun, overestimating her abilities. 'We never called her Superwoman,' a former colleague told the Daily Mail, 'we called her Brenda like the Queen.' But now that she had been shown to be an emotional toddler, her career was doomed. At no point during these 'so farewell then' rituals does anyone say: 'This woman cannot be trusted with power because she is a woman.' Instead, her critics seek to disqualify her by saying she is muddled, spineless, childish, wishy-washy. This is not to say that men in disgrace don't face caricature and harsh criticism, too. But there is a big difference between the sort of coverage Geoffrey Robinson has had and the coverage Mo Mowlam has been getting since her return from Northern Ireland. The question marks around Robinson concern his performance and his conduct, Mowlam's concern the very quality of her mind. Robinson's story is grounded in events; Mowlam's is grounded in a Westminster whispering campaign. Rumours persist that the radiotherapy she received in 1997 for a benign brain tumour has left her 'without the intellectual rigour to do her job'. Some feared that she has 'lost the plot'. Others are alleged to have confessed they are 'uneasy' around her. Any reader who accepted such vicious slander at face value would not be inclined to ask why David Trimble, the only named critic in the story, might have put pressure on Blair to replace Mowlam with someone who was a 'more serious politician'. Perhaps that was the point of the exercise. As smear campaigns go, it is still a pretty subtle one. Can this be taken as a sign of progress? In 1997, Women in Journalism did a research project in which it compared the coverage given to Alan Howarth when he left the Tories for New Labour, with the coverage given to Emma Nicholson when she left the Tories for the Lib Dems only a few weeks later. The differences were stark. While Howarth was portrayed as a man of vision acting on his conscience, Nicholson was described as witch-like and menopausal. Even in straight news stories, her decision was described as vengeful, petty and petulant. These same stories described her appearance and her family connections many column inches before they bothered to mention what she had achieved in her own career. When the research was published, Alan Howarth himself was one of the first to say how appalling it was that Nicholson had been treated so unfairly. The quality press took the criticism just as seriously. According to Ann Treneman, one of the authors, the report did make most quality papers pay closer attention to the way in which they portrayed prominent women. She points out that last week's coverage of Jennie Page is not about her appearance, but about the quality of her performance and the size of her pay-off.

Thus, Anita Roddick is a controversial household name and face while the many men who run companies of comparable size remain anonymous. There is safety in anonymity and in numbers. When a man gets the sack, he can expect some colleagues will stand up for him. But a prominent woman who gets the sack has no club of women to fall back on. As for the things her former colleagues have been saying, they tell you a lot less about Page's performance than they do about their reluctance to accept her as a figure of authority.

      "body": "<p>Martin McGuinness walked into David Trimble's room at Stormont in the middle of Friday afternoon to present Northern Ireland's soon-to-be-redundant First Minister with two unattainable requests.</p> <p>First, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator wanted Trimble to withdraw his letter of resignation as First Minister which was still in the hands of the Ulster Unionist Party's President Josias Cunningham. Second, McGuinness, the North's outgoing Education Minister, asked Trimble to postpone a critical meeting of his party's ruling body, the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council, in Belfast on Saturday morning. For good measure, he added, Peter Mandelson the Northern Ireland Secretary would have to repeal the legislation suspending the power-sharing executive.</p> <p>McGuinness told the UUP leader there was more on offer from the IRA regarding the vexed question of decommissioning. If Trimble withdrew his threat to pull down the 72-day-old power-sharing government and prevent the British government from suspending the Stormont executive, this would buy more time for the IRA to engage further with General John de Chastelain's international decommissioning body.</p> <p>However, Trimble was in no mood to backtrack on the promise he made in Belfast's Waterfront Hall last November when he decided to temporarily enter government with Sinn Fein and wait for the IRA to decommission within three months. As one Trimble ally put it: 'David knew he would be pulled apart by his party if he compromised any further.'</p> <p>Compromise, however, was a word being heavily hyped by officials from the Irish government late on Friday afternoon after it was learned that a senior IRA representative was reported to be holding further talks with General de Chastelain at a secret location in the Irish Republic.</p> <p>Given the news from Dublin, Peter Mandelson and his officials at the Northern Ireland Office also sought to buy time. Mandelson held a meeting with Cunningham shortly after 2pm and pleaded for a few extra hours.</p> <p>The UUP president agreed to grant Mandelson an additional two and a half-hours before he finally suspended devolution and re-imposed direct rule. Trimble and his party were determined that suspension of the executive would make headline news at teatime.</p> <p>Their thinking, according to a party spokesman, was that grassroots members across Northern Ireland due to attend the UUP council meeting the next day would get the message loud and clear on the evening news - this time the British government would not let them down. Following his meeting with Cunningham, Mandelson spoke by phone with Gerry Adams. The Sinn Fein president gave no impression that a breakthrough was in the offing. Nor did Adams suggest anything dramatic when, soon after, he spoke to Tony Blair.</p> <p>Shortly before 5pm Mandelson swallowed hard and prepared to release the long-awaited De Chastelain report which had been originally planned for release on 31 January. It is now known that the report was kept in cold storage at the insistence of the Irish government.</p> <p>The content of the first report made grim reading for those seeking a sign that the IRA was moving from its 'no surrender' position on decommissioning. The Irish played for time too, hoping that they could modify the report in the event of new engagement between the Canadian general and the IRA.</p> <p>But by 5pm on Friday evening, the British had had enough. Mandelson suspended the Executive and simultaneously published the report. It was the only way of saving Trimble from resignation. Although point three of the report noted the IRA's recent statement that it posed no threat to the peace process, the General's commission added: 'But our sole task is decommissioning, and to date we have received no information from the IRA as to when decommissioning will start.'</p> <p>These words confirmed many Ulster Unionists' suspicions that the IRA was never serious about decommissioning and that, as Sinn Fein's Pat Doherty let slip in the United States last November, republicans never believed the UUP would 'collapse' the power-sharing government once the institutions were up and running. The mood within the UUP has clearly been hardening over the past few weeks.</p> <p>The South Down Association, which includes loyalist heartlands like Kilkeel, a fishing port, had backed Trimble's jump into government last November. A fortnight ago party headquarters in Glengall Street asked the Association for its annual inventory of members.</p> <p>The UUP in south Down whose Assembly members include Dermot Nesbitt, one of the most moderate and liberal party spokesman, refused to reaffirm its membership until after the UUP Council meeting. Maynard Hanna, a former Trimble supporter, summed up the attitude in south Down: 'We told our headquarters that they wouldn't get a single membership card until we were sure the party was holding to its line that there had to be actual decommissioning to keep us in the government with Sinn Fein.'</p> <p>Mandelson's decision to suspend inevitably infuriated the republicans. The Northern Ireland Office insist they knew the IRA was holding a second meeting with De Chastelain but were totally unaware that a new breakthrough was around the corner. Twenty minutes after suspension, Adams released a statement claiming there had been a development of 'enormous significance' between the IRA and the De Chastelain commission.</p> <p>Adams challenged Mandelson to immediately rescind the suspension of the Executive in the light of the new development. Republican leaders accused the Northern Ireland Secretary of bending under pressure from Trimble.

This division of opinion on a critical aspect of the Agreement illuminates the deep divisions between the two governments over the political crisis.</p> <p>The British have admitted that the detail over suspending the north-south bodies 'has yet to be worked out' according to the NIO - code for a serious difference of opinion. Even as early as last Wednesday, Labour's Lord Falconer, who was winding up the second reading of the bill enabling for the transfer of power back to London, admitted there were technical difficulties with freezing the north-south bodies.</p> <p>'We shall agree to make provisions in consultation with the Irish government for the practicalities as far as the north-south bodies are concerned. The clear principle underlining the Agreement on which we shall act is that all those institutions are interlocking and interdependent,' Falconer told the Lords.</p> <p>The trouble is: as late as yesterday the Irish government took a different view. Dublin sought legal opinion yesterday morning on the status of the north-south institutions which it wants to keep functioning through the work of civil servants from both sides of the border.</p> <p>One of Trimble's sharpest critics, the UK Unionist MP Robert McCartney, said the British were wrong to believe they could unilaterally suspend the cross-border bodies, so beloved of republicans who see them as institutional stepping stones towards a united Ireland.</p> <p>'Trimble told everyone that the Ministers would be accountable to the Assembly. But the Irish are right in the sense that the north-south bodies are subject to an international treaty signed by two parties, London and Dublin. These institutions can't just be unilaterally suspended, Trimble's analysis is wrong,' McCartney said.</p> <p>A small band of loyalist extremists, mostly women, heckled UUP delegates at yesterday's meeting. They shouted, 'hang the traitors' and denounced leading pro-Agreement UUP members like Sir Reg Empey.</p> <p>Inside the auditorium, the UUP agreed to set up a working party to monitor what happens when the Northern Ireland parties enter a second review of the Good Friday Agreement. The working party, according to Trimble, will embrace all wings of the party including a number of leading figures in the anti-agreement camp. Whether the group will act as a shackle around Trimble, restricting his room for manoeuvre in the proposed talks is unclear.</p> <p>There was some sign of hope amid the gloom yesterday from delegates. Duncan Shipley Dalton, an English-born Assemblyman and for mer British soldier, accepted that the definition of IRA decommissioning could change and might be acceptable to Ulster Unionists.</p> <p>'If the IRA mean by \"putting beyond use\" sealing arms dumps and ensuring they are never used again I think I could live with that,' he said. 'I don't care whether the guns are cut in half by grinders or sealed in bunkers. As long as that's verifiable and permanent, who cares?'</p>",

But the Irish are right in the sense that the north-south bodies are subject to an international treaty signed by two parties, London and Dublin. These institutions can't just be unilaterally suspended, Trimble's analysis is wrong,' McCartney said. A small band of loyalist extremists, mostly women, heckled UUP delegates at yesterday's meeting. They shouted, 'hang the traitors' and denounced leading pro-Agreement UUP members like Sir Reg Empey. Inside the auditorium, the UUP agreed to set up a working party to monitor what happens when the Northern Ireland parties enter a second review of the Good Friday Agreement. The working party, according to Trimble, will embrace all wings of the party including a number of leading figures in the anti-agreement camp. Whether the group will act as a shackle around Trimble, restricting his room for manoeuvre in the proposed talks is unclear. There was some sign of hope amid the gloom yesterday from delegates. Duncan Shipley Dalton, an English-born Assemblyman and for mer British soldier, accepted that the definition of IRA decommissioning could change and might be acceptable to Ulster Unionists. 'If the IRA mean by \"putting beyond use\" sealing arms dumps and ensuring they are never used again I think I could live with that,' he said. 'I don't care whether the guns are cut in half by grinders or sealed in bunkers. As long as that's verifiable and permanent, who cares?'",

      "body": "<p>There is something very odd about Homo sapiens . Unlike other animals, we have no brother and sister species to share our world. Horses have zebra siblings, dolphins have porpoises, and lions have tigers. But we are home alone, the only two-legged intelligent primate on planet Earth. </p> <p>It was not always so. Scientists have recently discovered that for most of our evolutionary history we have co-habited with many different human beings - not just a couple, as once thought, but a startlingly wide array, it appears. More than 20 types of human being are now known, and the total is rising inexorably as scientists make more and more discoveries. In the last three years finds in Chad, Ethiopia and Spain have added three new types of human being to our family tree. </p> <p>Then, about 30,000 years ago, Homo sapiens suddenly found itself alone. But why? How did modern humans suddenly end up inheriting the world at the expense of sibling species such as the Neanderthals? Was it genocide or economic imperialism that led to their disappearance? In other words, does Slobodan Milosevic or Bill Gates make the best model for humanity? </p> <p>These critical questions have been raised by leading palaeontologists and archaeologists in a spate of recent articles and newspapers in journals that include the latest issues of Scientific American and British Archaeology . These scientists have looked upon the bones of the prehistoric dead - and have seen evidence of a Stone Age holocaust. A tendency to genocide may be a natural part of being human, they say. </p> <p>But such ideas are disputed by other scientists. They accept we were responsible for the eradication of fellow species of humans, but argue that this was the result of economic attrition. We are just overly competitive and better at securing resources, they argue. </p> <p>Either way, our solo status raises worrying issues. For whether it was the result of better organisation or outright violence, we face the same question: can any species of large animal hope to share a planet with Homo sapiens in the long run, they ask? </p> <p>'Just consider what happened when modern humans moved into Europe about 40,000 years ago,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London. 'We had to share it with the Neanderthals who had been doing quite nicely there for at least 200,000 years. Yet within 10,000 years of our arrival, we had rendered them extinct - and they were our closest relatives. </p> <p>'Of course, they shared exactly the same habitats as ourselves and so were the first to go. That much is clear. But now we are spreading, and it is the turn of more distant members of the primate family - chimps, gorillas and orang-utans. They, too, are all being driven towards extinction. You have to wonder where it will stop.' </p> <p>The story of mankind's inheritance of the world began five million years ago when a population of African apes began to adapt to a lifestyle away from forests that were then dwindling due to global ecological changes. These early hominids - of which Australopithecus anamensis , afarensis and africanus are the principal types - were small of brain, but upright of posture. We can see evidence of their deft two-legged gait in the remarkable Laetoli steps, the prints of three australopithecine apemen who wandered across a field of hot volcanic sediments in East Africa 3.5 million years ago, preserving their footprints in the ashes of time. </p> <p>Yet these early ancestors still retained only small, ape-sized brains and vegetarian lifestyles until about 2.5 million years ago, when signs of intellectual originality first emerged with the manufacture of the first stone tools. By this time, at least four different types of human being - Homo rudolfensis , habilis and erectus , and a separate variety of apemen, Australopithecus boseii - coexisted in the same part of East Africa. Other species also thrived to the south and the north. </p> <p>'Think of that scene from Star Wars - in the bar where you see all kinds of aliens playing and drinking and talking together,' says palaeontologist Yoel Rak. 'That's what our evolutionary past was really like.' </p> <p>Ours is not a story of a lone hero species' linear struggle to succeed, in other words, but one of repeated evolutionary experiments, as Ian Tattersall, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, points out. 'New hominid species have regularly emerged, competed, coexisted, colonised new environments and succeeded - or failed.' </p> <p>One of the East African Four, Homo erectus, adopted a diet rich in meat and tubers which triggered a protein influx that provided energy for brain growth, and, its wake, complex behaviour. Erectus - strong and athletic, but still only moderately endowed intellectually - then spread across the old world, leaving descendant species in various nooks and crannies. </p> <p>By 100,000 years before the present, natural selection's experiments with humanity had produced three different varieties of human being: big-brained Neanderthals in Europe, a separate population of erectus -like people which scientists now believe lingered on around Java; and, in Africa, Homo sapiens. The stage was set for the Big Takeover. </p> <p>Modern humans poured out of Africa and into Asia and eventually into Europe, completely replacing indigenous species of humans that stood in their way. There was no interbreeding, for no matter how hard they look at the genes of men and women today, scientists can see no signs of any input of DNA from other species. </p> <p>So did these sibling people disappear because of species-cleansing by Rambo-like thugs wielding the latest in rock weapons, or was it more gradual? Anthropologist Professor Leslie Aiello, of University College London, takes the latter view. 'I don't think it was hand-to-hand combat,' she says. 'We were just the best package, and lived longer and so bred more efficiently.' </p> <p>Aiello and others point to the wide web of alliances modern humans started to form when they arrived in Europe. Scientists have discovered that Neanderthal stone tools are hardly ever found more than 30 miles from their source, but those used by Homo sapiens are found up to 200 miles away. 'We networked well, and when times got hard we had kith and kin to run to,' says Professor Clive Gamble of Southampton University. 'The Neanderthals did not. It is like remembering aunties and cousins. We send Christmas cards, but the Neanderthals did not. That doomed them.' </p> <p>This is the Microsoft version of evolution, in other words. We simply strangled the opposition, slowly but effectively, because we were better, shrewder operators who monopolised resources. 'Neanderthals liked to move around but returned to favourite caves when times got hard,' points out Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris. 'Slowly groups would find that when they went back to those caves they had been taken over by spreading tribes of Homo sapiens . They ran out of places to hide.' </p> <p>The other scenario, that of a Stone Age holocaust, is less easy to support - for no Neanderthal skeletons peppered with arrow heads have been dug up by palaeontologists. Nevertheless, it is hard to avoid the notion that our meetings with Neanderthals were often violent and fatal. As Tattersall puts it in Scientific American : 'In the light of the Neanderthals' rapid disappearance, and of the appalling subsequent record of Homo sapiens , we can surmise that such interactions were rarely happy for the former.' </p> <p>Backed by improved linguistic abilities and a capacity to use mental symbols when working out problems, Homo sapiens would have been a deadly foe, he points out. 'A creature armed with symbolic skills is a formidable competitor - and not necessarily an entirely rational one, as the rest of the living world has discovered to its cost.' </p> <p>This view is shared by archaeologist Paul Pettitt, of Oxford University. 'Neanderthals had little to offer modern humans - except competition,' he states in British Archaeology . 'The attitude may have been to kill first, ask questions later. For too long we have regarded the extinction of Neanderthals as a chance historical accident. Rather, where Neanderthals and modern humans could not coexist, their disappearance may have been the result of the modern human race's first and most successful deliberate campaign of genocide.' </p> <p>It is a bleak view of Homo sapiens that is perfectly encapsulated in the words of Agent Smith in the box office hit The Matrix : 'Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with its surrounding environment. But you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply. You multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows this pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease of this planet. You are a plague.' </p> <p>This is overstating the case. Nevertheless, it is clear that our monopolistic status on Earth has not been a healthy one for the planet, no matter how it occurred. And there are other philosophical points to consider, as Carl Swisher, of the Berkeley Geochronology Centre in California, makes clear. 'Even atheists and agnostics have become inculcated with the idea that there is only one God, and that we - Homo sapiens - are made in his image, not a lot of other hominids, like the Neanderthals, as well.' In other words, we may have to think again about what it means to be made in His image. </p> <p>robin.mckie@observer.co.uk </p> <p>Robin McKie is the author of a new book Apeman, which accompanies a BBC2 series of the same name that begins at 9pm on 22 February</p>",

He met Nicola at Liverpool University, where they were both studying architecture; he was over on an exchange programme from Seattle. She later visited him in the US, he proposed and they were married there barely a week later. That was three years ago. Now they are settled in London, both practising architects. They bought a flat last summer, and have a four-month-old son, Jack. </p> <p>One of their main concerns at present is to set up a pension for Nicola. She is on maternity leave, but will go back to work in March. Her company does not provide a pension scheme. </p> <p>Saul, on the other hand, is in a group personal pension scheme with NPI through his job. His employer contributes around 2 per cent of his earnings to the scheme and Saul has also started paying in \u00a350 a month. </p> <p>Jack will be looked after at nursery when Nicola goes back to work. It will cost \u00a3640 per month ('more than the mortgage' comments Saul). This leads to another concern: how best to invest the \u00a31,000 Jack has received in gifts since he was born. </p> <p>The couple have around \u00a3500 in an Egg account. Saul is wondering about unit trusts, but is confused by the choice of managers. He is attracted by funds such as the Framlington NetNet fund. </p> <p>Saul is surprisingly relaxed about his student debt. He seems rather bemused by the debate here over university fees; in the US it is common practice for students to take out one loan after another. He has four loans for a staggering \u00a330,000, which he is now repaying at around \u00a3250 per month. Nicola, by contrast, only has around \u00a3400 in student debt. </p> <p>They have no other debts apart from their mortgage, a two-year fixed-rate loan from HSBC. Their repayments are about \u00a3550 a month; a mortgage protection policy including critical illness cover brings the monthly total to around \u00a3600. </p> <p>They plan to have another child, possibly in three years' time. Saul has no intention at present of going back to the US. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Saul and Nicola have taken their most important financial decision - they are planning early. Early action is the key to future financial security. </p> <p>First, there is Nicola's pension. Although her employer does not offer a company scheme, it will, as it has more than five employees, have to start a stakeholder scheme by 2001. Many employers are acting sooner. Nicola should ask her employer about its plans. </p> <p>One of the main attractions of a pension plan is the 23 per cent tax relief Nicola will receive. As her salary is likely to increase rapidly, she may become a higher-rate taxpayer, which makes pensions even more attractive. However, I would urge her to consider splitting her available income between pensions and individual savings accounts. </p> <p>When investing for children, the source of the money is critical for tax reasons. Where it comes from a parent, it is taxed as the parent's money, though the first \u00a3100 of interest can be paid tax-free. If the money is a gift from a grandparent, friend or relative, it can be taxed as the child's, so the child's personal allowance (currently \u00a34,335) can be used. </p> <p>In this case, I would advocate investing in unit or investment trusts, with the account designated for Jack. An initial \u00a31,000 could be invested, with the child benefit added as a regular monthly contribution. Unit and investment trusts are very flexible, the funds are accessible and returns over the long term are likely to outperform both inflation and deposit account rates. As the term is likely to be 15 to 20 years, I would be happy to recommend a more speculative investment: and technology funds, such as those offered by Aberdeen and Henderson, would be ideal.</p> <p>\u0095Gordon Wilson works for Aitchison &amp; Colegrave</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Martin Jones</strong></p> <p> Saul needs to be aware that US citizens must complete an annual tax return informing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of their income and capital gains. The system applies even to US citizens not currently resident there. All Americans, regardless of where they live, must report income and gains to the IRS. Failure to do so is a serious matter. Giving up US citizenship (the most obvious way out) is a relatively difficult and expensive procedure. </p> <p>US tax rates are not penal; the objective is to ensure you are not taxed in two countries on the same income and gains. However, difficulties can arise where, for example, UK investments are either tax-exempt or taxed at a favourable rate. Obvious examples are Isas and pension funds. Just because Isas are exempt in the UK does not mean they will be in the US. Pensions are more complicated but it is important to understand the tax treatment, as this is one of the key reasons for investing in a pension; the tax-free lump sum, arguably the main advantage of a UK pension, may not be tax free in the US. </p> <p>Saul should seek advice from someone with experience of both systems of taxation as soon as possible. The American Embassy can point him in the right direction. I do not feel Saul should make any further investments (other than deposits) until he is clear on his tax position. </p> <p>For some UK investments where the income and gains of more than one investor are 'pooled' - for example, in a unit trust - the details required by the IRS are considerably greater than that required under the UK system. As a result, US citizens should avoid them. </p> <p>\u0095Martin Jones works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg.</p>",

As the term is likely to be 15 to 20 years, I would be happy to recommend a more speculative investment: and technology funds, such as those offered by Aberdeen and Henderson, would be ideal. \u0095Gordon Wilson works for Aitchison &amp; Colegrave Adviser 2: Martin Jones Saul needs to be aware that US citizens must complete an annual tax return informing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of their income and capital gains. The system applies even to US citizens not currently resident there. All Americans, regardless of where they live, must report income and gains to the IRS. Failure to do so is a serious matter. Giving up US citizenship (the most obvious way out) is a relatively difficult and expensive procedure. US tax rates are not penal; the objective is to ensure you are not taxed in two countries on the same income and gains. However, difficulties can arise where, for example, UK investments are either tax-exempt or taxed at a favourable rate. Obvious examples are Isas and pension funds. Just because Isas are exempt in the UK does not mean they will be in the US. Pensions are more complicated but it is important to understand the tax treatment, as this is one of the key reasons for investing in a pension; the tax-free lump sum, arguably the main advantage of a UK pension, may not be tax free in the US. Saul should seek advice from someone with experience of both systems of taxation as soon as possible. The American Embassy can point him in the right direction. I do not feel Saul should make any further investments (other than deposits) until he is clear on his tax position. For some UK investments where the income and gains of more than one investor are 'pooled' - for example, in a unit trust - the details required by the IRS are considerably greater than that required under the UK system. As a result, US citizens should avoid them. \u0095Martin Jones works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg.",

      "body": "<p>If you know where to look, you can buy prints by leading artists for a lot less than gallery prices. Last week I visited two big collections of prints for sale that are little known to the public - at the Royal College of Art, in west London, and in a church hall-turned-studio in leafy Duxford, Cambridgeshire. </p> <p>At the RCA, Professor Chris Orr, director of printmaking, untied the ribbons of bulky portfolios in which the work of such renowned artists as Peter Blake, Patrick Caulfield, Eduardo Paolozzi, Julian Trevelyan and Paula Rego nestled between sheets of tissue paper. </p> <p>The prints are among about 3,500 to have gone on sale since the college's printmaking department began publishing prints in collaboration with established artists in 1982. The artists give students hands-on experience of silk screening, etching or lithography without payment, and sometimes learn new tricks themselves. The money raised from the sales helps pay for students' materials and study overseas. </p> <p>The snag - at least for the college - is that the teaching staff's first duty is not to market prints but to teach. The collection has no full-time curator to promote it, so it is virtually unknown to the public. </p> <p>Its first commercial outing was at the Contemporary Print Fair last November, where I bought a rare and stunning lithograph by Zandra Rhodes - not best known as a printmaker. Entitled Many Memories From India, it was an explosion of pink and blue and cost \u00a3293.75; I would have expected to pay \u00a3450 for it in a gallery. Did they, I asked knowingly, have a copy of William Scott's abstract lithograph Composition? No: they had sold the last for \u00a3400 to a London dealer, who resold it for \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Orr told me the RCA's prints were for sale to the public at trade prices. And as stocks have dwindled, the RCA has not jacked up the prices for remaining copies in the way some galleries do. </p> <p>Customers become subscribers for life by making a purchase worth at least \u00a3750, which qualifies them for discounts. </p> <p>With me at the RCA was the London dealer Jonathan Blond, of Blond Fine Art, who estimated for me the retail value of some of its stock. What would the prints of the various folios fetch if sold individually at gallery prices? </p> <p>Complete copies of only the first and last of the five 1982 folios are still available. They are \u00a3850 each, \u00a3750 to subscribers. Blond estimated the retail value of their contents - seven prints each - at \u00a31,600 per folio. A typically bold Terry Frost abstract, Newlyn Rhythm , which Frost says was the artist's first successful screen print, would be worth at least \u00a3450 on its own. So would a quintessential Julian Trevelyan etching, Villa Joyosa. </p> <p>There are some singles from an early, 1964 series, Shakespeare. Cecil Collins's lithograph A Midsummer Night's Dream (15 of 50 left) would cost RCA subscribers \u00a3250 - half its retail value. Sandra Blow's Hamlet, from the same series (20 left), is also \u00a3250 to subscribers, but worth about \u00a3350 retail. </p> <p>A folio of 48 prints, Artists' Choice (1987), is \u00a34,000 (\u00a33,500 to subscribers). By Ackroyd, Ayers, Bellany, Blake, Frink, Frost, Kiff, Proctor, Tilson and Weight among others, they could fetch \u00a36,000 retail in total. Ten are left. </p> <p>Orr says: 'Such folios have a place in history. They are a panorama of what was happening in printmaking then.' </p> <p>The latest collection looks set to be historic and lucrative. Called Panoramic , it contains 27 wide prints in an edition of 45, with only 10 for sale. The price is \u00a32,500, but the prints can be bought individually; a Blake for \u00a3350, a Ray Richardson for \u00a3300, an Adam Dant, the latest wonder-boy printmaker, at \u00a3250, and a sexy print by Marcus Harvey, whose painting of child murderer Myra Hindley caused controversy, for \u00a3300. Prints by recent graduates are \u00a3100. </p> <p>You can view the RCA's prints by appointment, but the next public buying opportunity will be the Art on Paper Fair at the college from 17-20 February. Blond will have a stand; his stock includes Hockneys, Hayters and Moores and Eileen Coopers. Prices range from under \u00a350 to \u00a32,000. </p> <p>You also need an appointment to go behind a plain blue door in Duxford, to see the undiscovered collection of the printmaker Kip Gresham. These prints, too, are for sale and, like the RCA collection, they have never been properly marketed. There is no showroom, not even a shop window. Viewing is by appointment. </p> <p>Half the images are ordered by commercial galleries, museums and Cambridge colleges. The other half - the collection's strength - are collaborations with famous artists that Gresham originated.

      "body": "<p>They may not have got off to a particularly good start, but the public seems to be warming to the Individual Savings Account (Isa). Over the first six months of the scheme, the Inland Revenue reported sales of \u00a312.7 billion, 40 per cent more than went into Peps and Tessas in the same period the previous year, and the market has been even busier since. </p> <p>Of that money, \u00a36.5bn went into mini-Isas, most of it in cash. Just over \u00a36bn went into maxi-Isas, of which \u00a35.7bn went into stocks and shares. The life assurance Isa element was not a popular option, however, capturing just \u00a326 million of investment in total. </p> <p>Research from fund management group Fidelity, shows that awareness of Isas has soared, with around three-quarters of the adult population now aware of their existence. But the research also found a lot of confusion about how they work, with only 27 per cent of those interviewed understanding that you cannot have a mini- and a maxi-Isa in the same tax year. </p> <p>Research group MarketMinder also found that 20 per cent of the Isa holders did not even know whether they had a maxi- or a mini-Isa (MarketMinder says as many as 50,000 people may hold both). Around two-thirds of investors had no idea whether their Isa was Catmarked or not. 'There's a high level of confusion out there,' says MarketMinder's Mike Hare. </p> <p>With investors who inadvertently run foul of the rules, the Inland Revenue is taking a fairly hard line. A spokesman said anyone taking out more Isas than the rules allow would have the second ruled invalid and be asked to pay any income or capital gains tax due. </p> <p>Cash Isas have got off to a flying start, and volumes have generally been main tained. Providers are wary about letting the competition know how much money they have actually taken, but the Halifax has said that it had more than 800,000 cash Isa accounts towards the end of December. </p> <p>Now, as the end of the tax year approaches, investors are expected to pile into equity Isas in the way they did into Peps. </p> <p><strong>Back to basics</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Isas are a tax-free shelter for savings and investments available to residents of the UK over the age of 18. </p> <p> \u0095 Money can be withdrawn at any time without loss of tax benefits. </p> <p> \u0095 Each Isa can contain one, or more, of the following components - cash, stocks and shares or insurance. </p> <p> \u0095 All three elements can be offered in a maxi-Isa, though you don't have to invest in all three. </p> <p> \u0095 Alternatively, you can have a mini-Isa comprising just one element. You can have one mini of each type, from different providers. </p> <p> \u0095 You cannot have a mini and a maxi-Isa in the same tax year. </p> <p> \u0095 If you have a maturing Tessa, the capital proceeds (maximum \u00a39,000) can be transferred into a Tessa-only Isa. This is in addition to any mini or maxi-Isas. </p> <p> \u0095 Maximum investment in a maxi-Isa is \u00a37,000 (\u00a35,000 next tax year). All of this can be used for stocks and shares, or you could put up to \u00a33,000 in cash (\u00a3,1000 next year) and \u00a31,000 in insurance and the rest in equities. </p> <p> \u0095 Maximum investment into a mini-Isa is \u00a33,000 in equities, \u00a33,000 in cash (\u00a31,000 next tax year) and \u00a31,000 in insurance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They may not have got off to a particularly good start, but the public seems to be warming to the Individual Savings Account (Isa). Over the first six months of the scheme, the Inland Revenue reported sales of \u00a312.7 billion, 40 per cent more than went into Peps and Tessas in the same period the previous year, and the market has been even busier since. Of that money, \u00a36.5bn went into mini-Isas, most of it in cash. Just over \u00a36bn went into maxi-Isas, of which \u00a35.7bn went into stocks and shares. The life assurance Isa element was not a popular option, however, capturing just \u00a326 million of investment in total. Research from fund management group Fidelity, shows that awareness of Isas has soared, with around three-quarters of the adult population now aware of their existence. But the research also found a lot of confusion about how they work, with only 27 per cent of those interviewed understanding that you cannot have a mini- and a maxi-Isa in the same tax year. Research group MarketMinder also found that 20 per cent of the Isa holders did not even know whether they had a maxi- or a mini-Isa (MarketMinder says as many as 50,000 people may hold both). Around two-thirds of investors had no idea whether their Isa was Catmarked or not. 'There's a high level of confusion out there,' says MarketMinder's Mike Hare. With investors who inadvertently run foul of the rules, the Inland Revenue is taking a fairly hard line. A spokesman said anyone taking out more Isas than the rules allow would have the second ruled invalid and be asked to pay any income or capital gains tax due. Cash Isas have got off to a flying start, and volumes have generally been main tained. Providers are wary about letting the competition know how much money they have actually taken, but the Halifax has said that it had more than 800,000 cash Isa accounts towards the end of December. Now, as the end of the tax year approaches, investors are expected to pile into equity Isas in the way they did into Peps. Back to basics \u0095 Isas are a tax-free shelter for savings and investments available to residents of the UK over the age of 18. \u0095 Money can be withdrawn at any time without loss of tax benefits. \u0095 Each Isa can contain one, or more, of the following components - cash, stocks and shares or insurance. \u0095 All three elements can be offered in a maxi-Isa, though you don't have to invest in all three. \u0095 Alternatively, you can have a mini-Isa comprising just one element. You can have one mini of each type, from different providers. \u0095 You cannot have a mini and a maxi-Isa in the same tax year. \u0095 If you have a maturing Tessa, the capital proceeds (maximum \u00a39,000) can be transferred into a Tessa-only Isa. This is in addition to any mini or maxi-Isas. \u0095 Maximum investment in a maxi-Isa is \u00a37,000 (\u00a35,000 next tax year). All of this can be used for stocks and shares, or you could put up to \u00a33,000 in cash (\u00a3,1000 next year) and \u00a31,000 in insurance and the rest in equities. \u0095 Maximum investment into a mini-Isa is \u00a33,000 in equities, \u00a33,000 in cash (\u00a31,000 next tax year) and \u00a31,000 in insurance.",

'Trade barriers are coming down, the European market is opening up and the Internet is bringing the world together.

It is available at an introductory initial charge of 3 per cent until the end of May, and Royds says 40,000 brochures were sent out in the first three days. </p> <p>'A lot of people would like to invest in world-class companies,' enthuses Royds. 'This is a new movement and it's growing fast, and it is appealing to investors because of the efficient way in which these global players can manage their capital and their costs.' </p> <p>Mercury's Global Titans unit trust is one of a pair of new Isa offerings with a global theme being promoted this spring. The other is Fidelity's Triple 2000 Isa, which is actually a neat package of three existing funds, which will each take a share of investors' proceeds. The funds in question are: Fidelity American (50 per cent); Fidelity Japan Special Situations (25 per cent); and Fidelity South East Asia (25 per cent). </p> <p>Fidelity is aiming to capitalise on is the large number of investors who bought Peps for many years, and now have portfolios heavily weighted towards the UK and Europe, with little exposure elsewhere. Fidelity has reduced the Isa's initial charge from 3.25 per cent to 2 per cent until 20 February. </p> <p>Under the old Pep rules, you were allowed to invest only \u00a31,500 each year in funds that had less than half their money invested in the UK and Europe. As a result, many people completely ignored regions such as the Far East and North America. </p> <p>Fidelity spokeswoman Jo Rodda says: 'We're saying that you have to make sure your portfolio is diversified, and there are a lot of people who have taken out Peps year after year who simply aren't.' </p> <p>The extent to which you should attempt to spread your investments around the world - as opposed to investing closer to home - is still controversial. Most financial advisers suggest that UK investments should make up around 50 per cent of your portfolio, even though the UK represents only a tiny part of the world's stock markets. </p> <p>The reason, they say, is twofold. First, investment in the UK market is not subject to currency risk. The Asian crisis of the late nineties represented a double whammy for investors. Not only did share prices plummet, but most South-east Asian currencies went into freefall, making the overall effect far worse. </p> <p>Second, it is easier to understand what is going on in the UK market. By assiduously reading the business pages, you may be able to correctly identify a good time to buy a small companies fund in the UK. </p> <p>But when you invest in a global fund, you are placing yourself entirely in the hands of the fund managers. 'If you were to be ruthlessly logical, you would probably send most of your money overseas,' says Tom McPhail of financial adviser TQ Direct.

Fidelity's Triple 2000 Isa may not be the most innovative product in terms of latching on to contemporary themes, but the company claims that the results speak for themselves. A \u00a37,000 sum invested five years ago in the combination of funds chosen would be worth \u00a324,318 today, it says. This compares with an average return of \u00a313,237 in the Global Growth unit trust sector. In the past year alone, the Triple 2000 Isa would have generated a return of 103 per cent. </p> <p>The protesters at Davos may not like it, but as business becomes more global, investors are inevitably going to want to invest in the most competitive companies, wherever they are based. </p> <p>As McPhail puts it: 'If you are really investing for the long term - over 20 or 30 years, say - you really should take a global view, because nobody knows how well our economy is going to fare over that time.

This provides a fixed income and ensures that the investors get their capital back. \u0095Chase de Vere and Nelson are offering free guides on investing in bonds and bond funds. Call Nelson on 0800 328 4422 and Chase de Vere on 0845 6092003.

Hollands says: 'While I have decided not to include direct holdings in a technology fund, because I feel the current valuation bubble presents too high a risk premium, I should point out that many of these managers are willing to take sizable positions in technology and telecommunications stocks as and when they feel they are attractive - so the tech theme is not absent.' </p> <p>Hollands plans to add technology exposure to the portfolio when shares in the sector have come down from current levels.

We are in the midst of a huge increase in housing demand by single people. About 80 per cent of new homes will go to single people over the next 15 years, according to official estimates.

In 1971, about 18 per cent of households were single, according to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. By 2011, that proportion is expected to be 33 per cent. Much depends on the imagination of property developers, a worrying prospect for people who have looked around new housing estates and developments.</p> <p> Most developers focus their attention on family homes, assuming that most of us will want to fit the average unit of 2.7 people. </p> <p> In the past, the single market has been badly served. Until 30 years ago, single women rarely lived alone, while single men lived in digs supported by a landlady who even made their tea. In the 70s and 80s, the flatshare market expanded dramatically, but a flatshare is often a depressing option for someone much beyond their twenties. In most of the country the vast majority of properties were houses; flats were commonplace in London, the south coast and Edinburgh. 'The single-person product has yet to be created,' says Richard Donnell of surveyor FPDSavill.</p> <p> Some characteristics of the single market are emerging, however. Research published in the Royal Society of Arts Journal in December suggests that single people are 'discerning purchasers ...very conscious of their residential environment...most want two bedrooms...they want parking for their cars and they also want private open space, not a large garden but a small garden or patio.' </p> <p>Community is arguably even more important to them than to larger households. Jonathan Woodfield, of surveyor DTZ, is noticing a vast increase in demand from singles in the centre of London, typically for one-bedroom flats (\u00a3215,000 - \u00a3250,000) and two-bedroom properties (\u00a3300,000-\u00a3400,000): 'They work hard and play hard. When they get back from work, they might have a shower and then go to a wine bar or to a theatre.' The planned leisure centre at the Harrods Village development includes a swimming pool, gym, sauna and business centre. Single people are also more likely to want to live close to transport so that they can meet up with other people. </p> <p>The Peabody Trust is also noticing the sense of community that is developing in its new 'live/work' development in the Docklands, London. Opened last summer, the West Ferry scheme sought to provide affordable housing to people in the early stages of setting up a business. </p> <p> Many of the 27 live/work units (comprising living space and a studio, as the name suggests) have been taken up by single people. There is an aromatherapist, an IT consultant and a photographer, for instance. 'They are enjoying the informal support of having like-minded people around,' says a spokeswoman for the Trust. Under the scheme, the residents get a 20-25 per cent discount on local rents - paying \u00a34,244 a year in rent and another \u00a32,100 in service charges (covering the provision of business advice). </p> <p>Both the Peabody Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation are well aware of the growing housing needs of single people - and both are running pilot schemes to encourage developers, architects, local authorities, the government and other interested parties to take the issue seriously.</p> <p> Joseph Rowntree is just launching its Caspar (City-centre Apartments for Single People at Affordable Rents) schemes in Leeds and Birmingham.

Its rents will start at \u00a3100-a-week for a one-bedroom flat.

      "body": "<p>Homebuyers are being encouraged to choose discount and fixed-rate loans in the midst of a fierce price war among lenders. </p> <p>With variable rates likely to go up at most lenders from the start of March - following last week's base rate rise - discounts and fixed rate loans could look particularly attractive. </p> <p>Halifax led the way in putting up rates - increasing the standard rate from 7.49 to 7.74 per cent - adding \u00a39-a-month to a \u00a360,000 repayment loan. Those lenders that did not follow suit last week are expected to make their announcements this week - passing on, like the Halifax, the full base rate rise of 0.25 per cent. The base rate now stands at 6 per cent. </p> <p> Borrowers will see another hike in their payments in April once Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) is finally abolished: someone on a standard variable rate of 7.74 per cent will be paying about \u00a319 more each month when the tax relief is withdrawn.

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers are being encouraged to choose discount and fixed-rate loans in the midst of a fierce price war among lenders. With variable rates likely to go up at most lenders from the start of March - following last week's base rate rise - discounts and fixed rate loans could look particularly attractive. Halifax led the way in putting up rates - increasing the standard rate from 7.49 to 7.74 per cent - adding \u00a39-a-month to a \u00a360,000 repayment loan. Those lenders that did not follow suit last week are expected to make their announcements this week - passing on, like the Halifax, the full base rate rise of 0.25 per cent. The base rate now stands at 6 per cent. Borrowers will see another hike in their payments in April once Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) is finally abolished: someone on a standard variable rate of 7.74 per cent will be paying about \u00a319 more each month when the tax relief is withdrawn.

      "body": "<p>What were we supposed to call this? Was it art? Some kind of bizarre political statement? A bit of a larf spun horribly out of control? If it was any of these things, it was the most extraordinary example anyone committed in the last two decades of the 20th century. It went almost unnoticed at the time, because few people were prepared to countenance the possibility that it was more than a stunt, couldn't believe anyone would do such a thing, be that stupid/irresponsible/free. But it wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. </p> <p>'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group the KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since'</p> <p>On 23 August 1994, Drummond and his partner Jimmy Cauty travelled to the Isle of Jura and, before a sceptical invited audience, ritually burned \u00a31 million - in notes - of their own cash. Both in their late thirties, they'd earned the money as the men behind one of the UK's most unlikely pop groups. In 1991, the KLF, an acronym for Kopyright Liberation Front, was the bestselling British act in the world. Riding the post-acid house boom in club music, they could do no wrong: every tune they touched turned to gold. But the next year, they opened the Brit Awards with a scathing performance, backed by a co-opted heavy metal band. At the end of it, a stunned audience heard them announce that 'the KLF have left the music business'. A freshly slaughtered sheep was laid at the entrance to the post-awards party, with a tag reading: 'I died for ewe. Bon appetit.' They had been presented with the coveted gong for best group, then immediately dissolved themselves. Then, in 1994, they burned most of the money they'd made up to that point. Why?</p> <p>Drummond sits before me, a stubbly <br>but youthful-looking 47, eating a cheese omelette and chips in a north London greasy spoon, the first thing he's eaten today, at 2.30pm, in the first interview he's done in six years. He and Cauty have made a deal not to talk about the million pounds, he tries to tell me. We're fencing. I ask him how much they earned during their peak.</p> <p>'Are you trying to ascertain whether a million pounds was that much to us?' he replies, fixing me with a steady gaze.</p> <p>Yes, I say.</p> <p>He nods slowly. 'But it wasn't about burning all the money. And it wasn't about cleansing anyone's soul. In this context, a million is a lot more than 2 million. A million is the icon. It's what we talk about, dream about. It has the power.'</p> <p>Have you regretted it since?</p> <p>'...No...'</p> <p>Are you financially stable now?</p> <p>'No, I'm not. No.'</p> <p>So why did they do it, I ask, and how did <br>it feel to watch it wither and snake, finally, irretrievably, into the sky? The answer takes two hours to emerge, and even then I'm not sure I quite understand.<br>For the past few years, Drummond has been relatively quiet, living with his wife Sallie Fellowes and two (soon to be three) small children on a farm in Aylesbury. The tangled logic of his career appears to be reflected in his private life, which takes in three other children, with two other women. He is close to the eldest two, but hasn't seen the third since the child was 18 months, a situation he acknowledges as 'weird' and is understandably reluctant to talk about. At one point in his new book, 45, after having 'trashed' another relationship, he wonders whether he 'will ever get to live with any of my children'. The longer you look at his life and read his work, the more clearly do you see what looks like a pronounced and compulsive cycle of creation and destruction, stretching right back to his schooldays. </p> <p>His music career fits perfectly into this pattern, and it's what makes 45 such a good book about pop: few people in Britain can be in a better position to explore the dumb, chaotic tensions that make it tick - tensions between creation and destruction, ephemera and unwitting consequence, between mythology and visceral, irreducible truth. Many of his activities look like japes, but he will admit that 'we are serious about them, ridiculously serious'. He wants them to mean something, but knows that pop usually works best when it doesn't know what it means. And he knows. He can't help it. No wonder he wants to escape, but can't.</p> <p>45 purports to be a series of snapshots and memoirs taken from the year he turned 45, seemingly at random, but actually compiled with deceptive - he would say accidental - logic. An early passage finds him driving to Helsinki with his children Kate, 12, and James, 10, to deliver some records and take in a Michael Jackson concert. James has just announced his decision to give up learning to play the guitar he badgered his father into buying him and switch to bass. A row ensues.</p> <p>\"That's it, James. I'm not paying for your lessons any more. The only reason why you want to start playing the bass is because you think it is easier.\" My voice is raised, I'm losing it, something I hardly ever do with my children. A year ago he would be crying by this point; now he just sinks into sullen silence. Kate says nothing. I switch on the radio. Abba's 'Winner Takes It All'. I slip from reality into pop nirvana, where the pain of heartbreak feels like the ecstasy of submission... I hope Kate and James can't spot the tears now rolling down my cheeks.</p> <p>\"Don't you understand, Dad? I have to work hard at school all day, and if I come home and just spend all my time practising guitar it makes me a boring person.\"</p> <p>\"What, and lying around watching television doesn't?\"</p> <p>\"You're just getting like all the other dads, wanting me to do what you did.\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm not. I would far rather you didn't want to be in a band. Most people who dream or struggle their youth away wanting to be in a band end up unhappy, depressed, unfulfilled, 'cause it never happens.\"</p> <p>\"It happened for you.\"</p> <p>\"That was just luck. Look, even if it does <br>happen, it always goes wrong. Do you think Keith from Prodigy goes home at night happy?\"</p> <p>\"You talk rubbish, Dad. I want to be in a band because that's what I want to do; it's got nothing to do with you. And anyway, I don't want to be a bass player, I want to be a singer.\"</p> <p>\"James, all singers are thick. Think of the boy you like least in your class - he'll be the singer. Everybody hates singers.\"</p> <p>\"Crap. Everybody loves the singer most.\"</p> <p>\"I mean the other lads in the band. They always hate the singer. He's always the lazy, loudmouthed, show-off one. You don't want to be like Liam Gallagher, just standing around doing nothing but being thick.\"</p> <p>\"Oasis are one of the best bands in the world; better than the Beatles ever were - it would be great to be the singer of Oasis.\"</p> <p>I do not rise to the bait. Silence descends. </p> <p>I can't believe I've just had this conversation with my 10-year-old son. If he's like this now, what's he going to be like when he's 15 and growing dope plants in his bedroom?</p> <p>When Drummond was 15, he lived in a council house in Corby, in the East Midlands. He was born in South Africa, where his father, a Church of Scotland missionary, was working, and proudly recounts that his first words were in Xhosa, the language of the Bantu people. The incoming apartheid government forced the family home to Scotland before William was 18 months old, and thence to a council house in Corby. He was impatient with school and ultimately deemed unsuitable for the sixth form, he claims, after being caught reading the NME during a study period. Noting interests that included music and 'making things', a careers adviser suggested a future as an instrument maker, which required a qualification in art. Drummond enrolled in art school, but left before long, although his passion for art remains strong. 'It didn't work out,' is all he says now.</p> <p>Music provided the solution, first through membership of Liverpudlian one-hit wonders Big in Japan (with Lightning Seed Ian Broudie and future Frankie Goes to Hollywood singer Holly Johnson on - don't tell James - bass). When that collapsed, Drummond found more lasting influence as manager of f\u00eated local post-punk outfits The Teardrop Explodes and Echo and the Bunnymen. Establishing what would later become a pattern, he severed links with the latter at the peak of their popularity and went to work in the A&amp;R department of WEA Records, where he was responsible for signing acts to the label. The only significant thing he did at that time was to sign a group called Brilliant, which had been formed by the former Killing Joke bassist, Youth, and featured the guitarist Jimmy Cauty. After three years, Drummond left his job in ignominy, but not before he and Cauty had struck up a relationship. Their subsequent commercial success, he explains, was partly inspired by a desire to 'prove [WEA MD] Rob Dickens wrong'. So they did, spectacularly.</p> <p>KLF stands for Kopyright Liberation Front. Their first album, 1987 - What the Fuck is Going On?, made use of the newly accessible 'sampling' technology to borrow parts of other records and assemble them into something new. This is routine now - just ask Fatboy Slim - but was controversial at the time and led to a lawsuit with Abba over the unauthorised use of a passage from 'Dancing Queen', after which all unsold copies of the record had to be destroyed. Presaging things to come, Drummond and Cauty travelled to Stockholm in order to present a commemorative gold disc to Abba singer Agnetha Faltskog. Also presaging things to come, they couldn't find her, so gave the disc to a prostitute they happened across in the street, and came home.</p> <p>In 1988, the pair decided to have a number-one record. They changed their name to The Timelords and released a cheesy dance take on the theme from Doctor Who, 'Doctorin' the Tardis'. It duly topped the UK singles chart and inspired its authors to follow up with a book entitled The Manual (How <br>To Have A Number One The Easy Way). </p> <p>An Austrian duo, Edelweiss, followed their instructions and shifted 2 million units of a single called Give Me Edelweiss. A year later, again operating as the KLF, Drummond and Cauty began an extraordinary run of success with a pair of juddering rave anthems called 'What Time is Love?' and '3am Eternal'. In 1990, there came the first 'ambient house' LP, Chill Out, and in 1991, a further series of hit singles and the bestselling album <br>The White Room. Most bizarre of all, perhaps, was a version of their song 'Justified and Ancient', which featured country star Tammy Wynette on vocals and was only kept from the Christmas number-one slot by the death of Freddie Mercury and the re-release of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. It was hardly surprising if the duo began to imagine themselves immune to failure. They were having fun, could do anything. At the 1992 Brit Awards, they proved as much.</p> <p>Drummond is wearing jeans and work boots and fluorescent-orange donkey jacket with 'K2 Plant Hire' emblazoned on the back. He is soft spoken and intense, more comfortable discussing ideas and abstracts than emotion or inner life. His second wife used to worry that he would find God and join the church without warning. It hasn't happened yet, but you can see how it might.</p> <p>I'd heard that the original plan for the 1992 Brit Awards was to chop up a sheep on stage and throw the gore into the audience. Unfortunately, Extreme Noise Terror, the heavy metal backing band they used for the performance, were vegetarians and refused to be part of such a performance. Oh dear. At the same time, Drummond tells me with absolute conviction that his first wish for the 1992 Brit Awards was to cut off his hand and throw it into the audience.<br>'I thought that would be the ultimate thing, a way of taking it even further. I was inspired by the story of the red hand of Ulster, which you see on the Ulster flag. That comes from the story that, when the first people came to the region, there was a young man in the boat who wanted to be the first to claim it for his king or laird, so he chopped off his hand and threw it on to the beach. So in my head, I was chopping off my own hand and throwing it into the massed ranks of the music business, claiming it for myself.'</p> <p>You're telling me that you seriously considered this?</p> <p>'Yes, but it's hard... you end up going down an avenue where you are almost daring yourself. I bought the implement... and then... Jimmy talked me down, persuaded me that I didn't have to. The sheep became symbolic. They took the place of the hand.'</p> <p>Extraordinary. I am looking at Bill Drummond, yet hearing the voices <br>of Hannibal Lecter and David <br>St Hubbins of Spinal Tap. Perhaps it's me that needs help. At the same time, subsequent events suggest that Drummond should be taken seriously. After the dissolving the KLF, he and Cauty took the additional step of deleting their back catalogue, thus cutting off future sales and royalties. Reconstituted as the K Foundation, their first overt act was to establish a prize for the worst art of the year in 1993. Remarkably, you might think, the shortlist was the same as for that year's Turner Prize. Sculptor Rachel Whiteread won both, and was allegedly warned that, if she refused <br>the K Foundation's \u00a340,000, it would be <br>set alight. The Turner Prize was worth \u00a320,000. Whiteread did all right that year. Soon, however, the ante would be upped.</p> <p>I want to know two obvious things, the first being what possessed Drummond and his partner to burn \u00a31 million, the second being what he felt at the moment he knew the money couldn't be retrieved, that it was gone forever. He tries to tell me that his actions that day were just like the others.</p> <p>'I think I've always done the same thing, and it's just what it looks like on the outside that's different,' he contends, unconvincingly. 'I don't know what it is, but it's dealing with that same feeling on the inside and working with that.'</p> <p>What kind of feeling?</p> <p>'A sort of big thing that you've got to get out, and it's just the wrapping that makes it look different. I'm trying to make sense of something.'</p> <p>What?</p> <p>'I don't know what it is.'</p> <p>To me, as with the way you ended the KLF, it looked like an aggressive expression of loathing, not dissimilar to Richie Edwards of Manic Street Preachers carving '4 Real' in his arm with a penknife, or Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Reading 45, I wondered if you were exacting revenge on pop music for the damage it inflicted on your personal life? As we know, the myth and iconography come at a price.

In 45, Drummond betrays a rare trace of pride as he tells the story of how a forgotten KLF tune came to be used as an anti-Milosevic rallying cry in Serbia.</p> <p>You spend your pop life longing for one of your three-and-a-half minute slices of radio <br>fodder to rise above being mere pop music, to enter the social fabric of the nation and times <br>we live through, like 'Give Peace a Chance' or 'Anarchy in the UK' or 'Three Lions'. And this morning, I learn that a track that we recorded in a day, never released as a single, thought was crap and had forgotten about has taken on a meaning, an importance in a struggle I hardly understood. Strange.</p> <p>The most poignant passages of 45 come at the end, though, in a pair of chapters called 'Now That's What I Call Disillusionment' 1 and 2. In the first, Drummond tells the story of how he and Echo and the Bunnymen guitarist Will Sergeant flew home from the US specially to catch a rare performance by San Franciscan avant-garde legends the Residents, in Birmingham Town Hall, of all places. As so often in these instances, what they found was not what they had conjured in their fantasies. The next chapter concerns the KLF's self-mocking final performance, disguised as old men in motorised wheelchairs, at the Barbican in 1997. This provoked righteous scorn in the press, mostly in relation to the irony of the KLF making a comeback, however pranksterish and absurd. Drummond begins by quoting some of the reviews of that show, despairingly to begin with, then with a growing sense of peace and acceptance. Finally, he suggests, he was relieved of all obligation to live the myth, to be credible, bankable, in touch with the zeitgeist. He could pick up his pencil and get on with the rest of his life. That wasn't the best thing that happened that night, though. That involved a journalist from Time Out who had been one of the KLF's most ardent fans.</p> <p>In 1988, at the age of 12, he had bought our 'Doctorin' the Tardis'. He got on board. Then through his teenage years he had faithfully followed our every move. We were the idealised big brothers he never had. On our retirement from the music business in 1992, he even wrote a book recounting our exploits. Then that night in 1997, after we daubed our message on the grey concrete and were about to speed off looking for some after-hours action, I shook our former teenage Number One Fan's hand and wished him well. In that moment, as our hands shook, I detected something in the glint of his eye: disillusionment, as real and pure as disillusionment can get. Almost as powerful and strong as when I saw that bit of dark curly hair sticking out the back of that Resident's eyeball mask. In our (Jimmy's and my) short journey through pop, that moment of disillusionment was maybe our greatest creation. Without that final state of disillusion, the power and glory of pop is nothing. And when it happens (and if it has not already happened for you, it surely will), savour it, because it very quickly slithers into disinterest and gets forgotten as life marches on.</p> <p>\u0095 Bill Drummond's 45 is published by Little, Brown at <br>\u00a312.99, on 3 March.

      "bodyText": "What were we supposed to call this? Was it art? Some kind of bizarre political statement? A bit of a larf spun horribly out of control? If it was any of these things, it was the most extraordinary example anyone committed in the last two decades of the 20th century. It went almost unnoticed at the time, because few people were prepared to countenance the possibility that it was more than a stunt, couldn't believe anyone would do such a thing, be that stupid/irresponsible/free. But it wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group the KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since' On 23 August 1994, Drummond and his partner Jimmy Cauty travelled to the Isle of Jura and, before a sceptical invited audience, ritually burned \u00a31 million - in notes - of their own cash. Both in their late thirties, they'd earned the money as the men behind one of the UK's most unlikely pop groups. In 1991, the KLF, an acronym for Kopyright Liberation Front, was the bestselling British act in the world. Riding the post-acid house boom in club music, they could do no wrong: every tune they touched turned to gold. But the next year, they opened the Brit Awards with a scathing performance, backed by a co-opted heavy metal band. At the end of it, a stunned audience heard them announce that 'the KLF have left the music business'. A freshly slaughtered sheep was laid at the entrance to the post-awards party, with a tag reading: 'I died for ewe. Bon appetit.' They had been presented with the coveted gong for best group, then immediately dissolved themselves. Then, in 1994, they burned most of the money they'd made up to that point. Why? Drummond sits before me, a stubbly but youthful-looking 47, eating a cheese omelette and chips in a north London greasy spoon, the first thing he's eaten today, at 2.30pm, in the first interview he's done in six years. He and Cauty have made a deal not to talk about the million pounds, he tries to tell me. We're fencing. I ask him how much they earned during their peak. 'Are you trying to ascertain whether a million pounds was that much to us?' he replies, fixing me with a steady gaze. Yes, I say. He nods slowly. 'But it wasn't about burning all the money. And it wasn't about cleansing anyone's soul. In this context, a million is a lot more than 2 million. A million is the icon. It's what we talk about, dream about. It has the power.' Have you regretted it since? '...No...' Are you financially stable now? 'No, I'm not. No.' So why did they do it, I ask, and how did it feel to watch it wither and snake, finally, irretrievably, into the sky? The answer takes two hours to emerge, and even then I'm not sure I quite understand. For the past few years, Drummond has been relatively quiet, living with his wife Sallie Fellowes and two (soon to be three) small children on a farm in Aylesbury. The tangled logic of his career appears to be reflected in his private life, which takes in three other children, with two other women. He is close to the eldest two, but hasn't seen the third since the child was 18 months, a situation he acknowledges as 'weird' and is understandably reluctant to talk about. At one point in his new book, 45, after having 'trashed' another relationship, he wonders whether he 'will ever get to live with any of my children'. The longer you look at his life and read his work, the more clearly do you see what looks like a pronounced and compulsive cycle of creation and destruction, stretching right back to his schooldays. His music career fits perfectly into this pattern, and it's what makes 45 such a good book about pop: few people in Britain can be in a better position to explore the dumb, chaotic tensions that make it tick - tensions between creation and destruction, ephemera and unwitting consequence, between mythology and visceral, irreducible truth. Many of his activities look like japes, but he will admit that 'we are serious about them, ridiculously serious'. He wants them to mean something, but knows that pop usually works best when it doesn't know what it means. And he knows. He can't help it. No wonder he wants to escape, but can't. 45 purports to be a series of snapshots and memoirs taken from the year he turned 45, seemingly at random, but actually compiled with deceptive - he would say accidental - logic. An early passage finds him driving to Helsinki with his children Kate, 12, and James, 10, to deliver some records and take in a Michael Jackson concert. James has just announced his decision to give up learning to play the guitar he badgered his father into buying him and switch to bass. A row ensues. \"That's it, James. I'm not paying for your lessons any more. The only reason why you want to start playing the bass is because you think it is easier.\" My voice is raised, I'm losing it, something I hardly ever do with my children. A year ago he would be crying by this point; now he just sinks into sullen silence. Kate says nothing. I switch on the radio. Abba's 'Winner Takes It All'. I slip from reality into pop nirvana, where the pain of heartbreak feels like the ecstasy of submission... I hope Kate and James can't spot the tears now rolling down my cheeks. \"Don't you understand, Dad? I have to work hard at school all day, and if I come home and just spend all my time practising guitar it makes me a boring person.\" \"What, and lying around watching television doesn't?\" \"You're just getting like all the other dads, wanting me to do what you did.\" \"No, I'm not. I would far rather you didn't want to be in a band. Most people who dream or struggle their youth away wanting to be in a band end up unhappy, depressed, unfulfilled, 'cause it never happens.\" \"It happened for you.\" \"That was just luck. Look, even if it does happen, it always goes wrong. Do you think Keith from Prodigy goes home at night happy?\" \"You talk rubbish, Dad. I want to be in a band because that's what I want to do; it's got nothing to do with you. And anyway, I don't want to be a bass player, I want to be a singer.\" \"James, all singers are thick. Think of the boy you like least in your class - he'll be the singer. Everybody hates singers.\" \"Crap. Everybody loves the singer most.\" \"I mean the other lads in the band. They always hate the singer. He's always the lazy, loudmouthed, show-off one. You don't want to be like Liam Gallagher, just standing around doing nothing but being thick.\" \"Oasis are one of the best bands in the world; better than the Beatles ever were - it would be great to be the singer of Oasis.\" I do not rise to the bait. Silence descends. I can't believe I've just had this conversation with my 10-year-old son. If he's like this now, what's he going to be like when he's 15 and growing dope plants in his bedroom? When Drummond was 15, he lived in a council house in Corby, in the East Midlands. He was born in South Africa, where his father, a Church of Scotland missionary, was working, and proudly recounts that his first words were in Xhosa, the language of the Bantu people. The incoming apartheid government forced the family home to Scotland before William was 18 months old, and thence to a council house in Corby. He was impatient with school and ultimately deemed unsuitable for the sixth form, he claims, after being caught reading the NME during a study period. Noting interests that included music and 'making things', a careers adviser suggested a future as an instrument maker, which required a qualification in art. Drummond enrolled in art school, but left before long, although his passion for art remains strong. 'It didn't work out,' is all he says now. Music provided the solution, first through membership of Liverpudlian one-hit wonders Big in Japan (with Lightning Seed Ian Broudie and future Frankie Goes to Hollywood singer Holly Johnson on - don't tell James - bass). When that collapsed, Drummond found more lasting influence as manager of f\u00eated local post-punk outfits The Teardrop Explodes and Echo and the Bunnymen. Establishing what would later become a pattern, he severed links with the latter at the peak of their popularity and went to work in the A&amp;R department of WEA Records, where he was responsible for signing acts to the label. The only significant thing he did at that time was to sign a group called Brilliant, which had been formed by the former Killing Joke bassist, Youth, and featured the guitarist Jimmy Cauty. After three years, Drummond left his job in ignominy, but not before he and Cauty had struck up a relationship. Their subsequent commercial success, he explains, was partly inspired by a desire to 'prove [WEA MD] Rob Dickens wrong'. So they did, spectacularly. KLF stands for Kopyright Liberation Front. Their first album, 1987 - What the Fuck is Going On?, made use of the newly accessible 'sampling' technology to borrow parts of other records and assemble them into something new. This is routine now - just ask Fatboy Slim - but was controversial at the time and led to a lawsuit with Abba over the unauthorised use of a passage from 'Dancing Queen', after which all unsold copies of the record had to be destroyed. Presaging things to come, Drummond and Cauty travelled to Stockholm in order to present a commemorative gold disc to Abba singer Agnetha Faltskog. Also presaging things to come, they couldn't find her, so gave the disc to a prostitute they happened across in the street, and came home. In 1988, the pair decided to have a number-one record. They changed their name to The Timelords and released a cheesy dance take on the theme from Doctor Who, 'Doctorin' the Tardis'. It duly topped the UK singles chart and inspired its authors to follow up with a book entitled The Manual (How To Have A Number One The Easy Way). An Austrian duo, Edelweiss, followed their instructions and shifted 2 million units of a single called Give Me Edelweiss. A year later, again operating as the KLF, Drummond and Cauty began an extraordinary run of success with a pair of juddering rave anthems called 'What Time is Love?' and '3am Eternal'. In 1990, there came the first 'ambient house' LP, Chill Out, and in 1991, a further series of hit singles and the bestselling album The White Room. Most bizarre of all, perhaps, was a version of their song 'Justified and Ancient', which featured country star Tammy Wynette on vocals and was only kept from the Christmas number-one slot by the death of Freddie Mercury and the re-release of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. It was hardly surprising if the duo began to imagine themselves immune to failure. They were having fun, could do anything. At the 1992 Brit Awards, they proved as much. Drummond is wearing jeans and work boots and fluorescent-orange donkey jacket with 'K2 Plant Hire' emblazoned on the back. He is soft spoken and intense, more comfortable discussing ideas and abstracts than emotion or inner life. His second wife used to worry that he would find God and join the church without warning. It hasn't happened yet, but you can see how it might. I'd heard that the original plan for the 1992 Brit Awards was to chop up a sheep on stage and throw the gore into the audience. Unfortunately, Extreme Noise Terror, the heavy metal backing band they used for the performance, were vegetarians and refused to be part of such a performance. Oh dear. At the same time, Drummond tells me with absolute conviction that his first wish for the 1992 Brit Awards was to cut off his hand and throw it into the audience. 'I thought that would be the ultimate thing, a way of taking it even further. I was inspired by the story of the red hand of Ulster, which you see on the Ulster flag. That comes from the story that, when the first people came to the region, there was a young man in the boat who wanted to be the first to claim it for his king or laird, so he chopped off his hand and threw it on to the beach. So in my head, I was chopping off my own hand and throwing it into the massed ranks of the music business, claiming it for myself.' You're telling me that you seriously considered this? 'Yes, but it's hard... you end up going down an avenue where you are almost daring yourself. I bought the implement... and then... Jimmy talked me down, persuaded me that I didn't have to. The sheep became symbolic. They took the place of the hand.' Extraordinary. I am looking at Bill Drummond, yet hearing the voices of Hannibal Lecter and David St Hubbins of Spinal Tap. Perhaps it's me that needs help. At the same time, subsequent events suggest that Drummond should be taken seriously. After the dissolving the KLF, he and Cauty took the additional step of deleting their back catalogue, thus cutting off future sales and royalties. Reconstituted as the K Foundation, their first overt act was to establish a prize for the worst art of the year in 1993. Remarkably, you might think, the shortlist was the same as for that year's Turner Prize. Sculptor Rachel Whiteread won both, and was allegedly warned that, if she refused the K Foundation's \u00a340,000, it would be set alight. The Turner Prize was worth \u00a320,000. Whiteread did all right that year. Soon, however, the ante would be upped. I want to know two obvious things, the first being what possessed Drummond and his partner to burn \u00a31 million, the second being what he felt at the moment he knew the money couldn't be retrieved, that it was gone forever. He tries to tell me that his actions that day were just like the others. 'I think I've always done the same thing, and it's just what it looks like on the outside that's different,' he contends, unconvincingly. 'I don't know what it is, but it's dealing with that same feeling on the inside and working with that.' What kind of feeling? 'A sort of big thing that you've got to get out, and it's just the wrapping that makes it look different. I'm trying to make sense of something.' What? 'I don't know what it is.' To me, as with the way you ended the KLF, it looked like an aggressive expression of loathing, not dissimilar to Richie Edwards of Manic Street Preachers carving '4 Real' in his arm with a penknife, or Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Reading 45, I wondered if you were exacting revenge on pop music for the damage it inflicted on your personal life? As we know, the myth and iconography come at a price. I also thought the act said something quite profound about our relationship to money, as the anger felt in some quarters about your not having given yours to charity showed, but we'll have to save that for another time. 'No, I don't think that's right, though it touches on certain things. Jimmy and I made an agreement not to talk about this for a certain time, because the more we did, the more its impact became dissipated. What I will say is that I've never seen it as a destructive thing. It wasn't to destroy the money. It was to watch it burn.' Can you imagine ever regretting what you've done? 'Well, obviously, if one of your kids is dying of cancer and there's an expensive clinic in California which can cure them... but other than that, no.' The great thing about UK pop is that trash and substance can exist side by side, often in the same artefact. In 45, Drummond betrays a rare trace of pride as he tells the story of how a forgotten KLF tune came to be used as an anti-Milosevic rallying cry in Serbia. You spend your pop life longing for one of your three-and-a-half minute slices of radio fodder to rise above being mere pop music, to enter the social fabric of the nation and times we live through, like 'Give Peace a Chance' or 'Anarchy in the UK' or 'Three Lions'. And this morning, I learn that a track that we recorded in a day, never released as a single, thought was crap and had forgotten about has taken on a meaning, an importance in a struggle I hardly understood. Strange. The most poignant passages of 45 come at the end, though, in a pair of chapters called 'Now That's What I Call Disillusionment' 1 and 2.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair may have tried to shrug off last week's resignation of Labour's man in Wales, First Secretary Alun Michael, as nothing more than malicious 'fun and games'. But he can't ignore the issue that precipitated Michael's downfall. </p> <p>The Government's failure to explain how it will match some \u00a33.2 billion of European 'Objective One' funding for the country's most deprived areas with UK funds puts at risk an estimated \u00a31bn of the money. And the issue extends well beyond Wales. </p> <p>Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Cornwall also rejoiced last year when they learnt they were to receive EU money for training, business support, infrastructure programmes and community projects from 2000 to 2006. </p> <p>Labour MP Dave Watts, head of the Commons Objective One group, says: 'There are very significant shortfalls. The Government has not resolved the matching issue. It's not serving people in deprived regions well.' </p> <p>The debacle has been brought about by a classic recipe for chaos: too little cash, too much bureaucracy. </p> <p>There is not enough money immediately available to the regions from government departments. Negotiations about increasing it will not start until the Treasury's next comprehensive spending review, this summer. </p> <p>But the problems reach much deeper, into an administrative nightmare. The process starts at EU level. Officials decide which areas will receive funds by identifying those whose economic output per head is less than 75 per cent of the average. Then they calculate how much each region is to get by using a formula combining how far below the 75 per cent they fall with other factors, such as unemployment levels. </p> <p>South Yorkshire should receive approximately \u00a3780 million, Merseyside \u00a3844m, Cornwall \u00a3315m, and Wales \u00a31.2bn. But this is matched funding, so unless the UK puts up as much again, the EU money is lost. </p> <p>Theoretically, the EU cash is administered by the Treasury. But since Britain is a net contributor to European funds, it does not actually receive the money from Brussels. Instead, it subtracts the \u00a33.2bn from the amount the UK pays into EU coffers. </p> <p>The Treasury has to prove to the EU that it is adding the Objective One money to the budgets of individual government departments. It cannot substitute the EU cash for spending already planned. </p> <p>So far, so comprehensible, but now the descent into bureaucratic madness begins. Although the money exists to help particular regions, the Treasury decides which Objective One spending departments - Trade and Industry; Environment, Transport and the Regions; Education and Employment; Health; or Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - the \u00a33.2bn will go to. </p> <p>Next the departments work out how much of the money they are to receive will go to each of five sorts of projects eligible for Objective One help: business support, infrastructure, training, community development, and agriculture and fisheries. </p> <p>The money is then distributed to departments - but it is not linked to the individual projects it will eventually be spent on, nor to the regions where it will end up. </p> <p>Geoff Fieldsend, head of the South Yorkshire Forum policy unit, who is spearheading the region's attempts to get funds, says: 'If this had been done properly, we would know what funds were available for what area and for what projects. But we don't.' </p> <p>The regions themselves draw up spending projects across the five categories. To access the cash they each contact their regional government office, detail the project and show they have matching funding. The office then applies to the department concerned for the EU money. </p> <p>This is where the matching problems come in. Each pound of European money spent must be 'matched' by a UK pound. It is not only that there is too little UK money; a lack of 'joined-up government' means that what cash there is has been allocated to departments in a way which bears little relation to regions' needs. </p> <p>The Government says it is up to the regions to find the matched money they need, but to do so they have to look to a host of programmes managed centrally by Whitehall. These include the Department of Trade and Industry's Small Business Service and other DTI initiatives; the Department for Education and Employment's Learning and Skills Councils; some tertiary education funding bodies; and the New Deal. </p> <p>Infrastructure and community projects are paid for out of DETR funds, largely administered by Regional Development Agencies - themselves criticised for being underfunded. </p> <p>Ministers have not decided whether money from the biggest fund, the \u00a3150m-a-year Regional Selective Assistance budget, can be allowed to go towards matching EU funds. This may seem absurd: why not collect a matching \u00a3150m from Brussels? But if used for Objective One projects, this budget would not be available to sweeten inward investors such as BMW. </p> <p>Because EU money is allocated from the top down and bears no relation to the ability of individual departments to match it, the result is a misalignment of funding. </p> <p>Dr Pernella Kousguard of the Merseyside Policy Unit says: 'Our priority this year is business support. This is funded by the DTI. But the DTI schemes we can use for matched funding do not have enough. Yet other departments have more than we need for our training plans.' </p> <p>Merseyside's other priorities include infrastructure projects such as schemes at Liverpool's docks and close to Ford's Halewood plant. 'These will be funded by the Regional Development Agencies [RDAs] but they just don't have access to the funds,' says Kousguard. </p> <p>South Yorkshire faces similar problems. Fieldsend points out that of the \u00a3200m matched funding needed for its key priority - business support - only \u00a320m has been identified from paltry DTI funds. This means the region could end up with only \u00a340m of a possible \u00a3400m total. On top of that, only half of the \u00a3200m matched funding needed for infrastructure has been identified from RDAs. </p> <p>Under Objective One rules, any unmatched EU money has to be handed back to Brussels.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair may have tried to shrug off last week's resignation of Labour's man in Wales, First Secretary Alun Michael, as nothing more than malicious 'fun and games'. But he can't ignore the issue that precipitated Michael's downfall. The Government's failure to explain how it will match some \u00a33.2 billion of European 'Objective One' funding for the country's most deprived areas with UK funds puts at risk an estimated \u00a31bn of the money. And the issue extends well beyond Wales. Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Cornwall also rejoiced last year when they learnt they were to receive EU money for training, business support, infrastructure programmes and community projects from 2000 to 2006. Labour MP Dave Watts, head of the Commons Objective One group, says: 'There are very significant shortfalls. The Government has not resolved the matching issue. It's not serving people in deprived regions well.' The debacle has been brought about by a classic recipe for chaos: too little cash, too much bureaucracy. There is not enough money immediately available to the regions from government departments. Negotiations about increasing it will not start until the Treasury's next comprehensive spending review, this summer. But the problems reach much deeper, into an administrative nightmare. The process starts at EU level. Officials decide which areas will receive funds by identifying those whose economic output per head is less than 75 per cent of the average. Then they calculate how much each region is to get by using a formula combining how far below the 75 per cent they fall with other factors, such as unemployment levels. South Yorkshire should receive approximately \u00a3780 million, Merseyside \u00a3844m, Cornwall \u00a3315m, and Wales \u00a31.2bn. But this is matched funding, so unless the UK puts up as much again, the EU money is lost. Theoretically, the EU cash is administered by the Treasury. But since Britain is a net contributor to European funds, it does not actually receive the money from Brussels. Instead, it subtracts the \u00a33.2bn from the amount the UK pays into EU coffers. The Treasury has to prove to the EU that it is adding the Objective One money to the budgets of individual government departments. It cannot substitute the EU cash for spending already planned. So far, so comprehensible, but now the descent into bureaucratic madness begins. Although the money exists to help particular regions, the Treasury decides which Objective One spending departments - Trade and Industry; Environment, Transport and the Regions; Education and Employment; Health; or Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - the \u00a33.2bn will go to. Next the departments work out how much of the money they are to receive will go to each of five sorts of projects eligible for Objective One help: business support, infrastructure, training, community development, and agriculture and fisheries. The money is then distributed to departments - but it is not linked to the individual projects it will eventually be spent on, nor to the regions where it will end up. Geoff Fieldsend, head of the South Yorkshire Forum policy unit, who is spearheading the region's attempts to get funds, says: 'If this had been done properly, we would know what funds were available for what area and for what projects. But we don't.' The regions themselves draw up spending projects across the five categories. To access the cash they each contact their regional government office, detail the project and show they have matching funding. The office then applies to the department concerned for the EU money. This is where the matching problems come in. Each pound of European money spent must be 'matched' by a UK pound. It is not only that there is too little UK money; a lack of 'joined-up government' means that what cash there is has been allocated to departments in a way which bears little relation to regions' needs. The Government says it is up to the regions to find the matched money they need, but to do so they have to look to a host of programmes managed centrally by Whitehall. These include the Department of Trade and Industry's Small Business Service and other DTI initiatives; the Department for Education and Employment's Learning and Skills Councils; some tertiary education funding bodies; and the New Deal. Infrastructure and community projects are paid for out of DETR funds, largely administered by Regional Development Agencies - themselves criticised for being underfunded. Ministers have not decided whether money from the biggest fund, the \u00a3150m-a-year Regional Selective Assistance budget, can be allowed to go towards matching EU funds. This may seem absurd: why not collect a matching \u00a3150m from Brussels? But if used for Objective One projects, this budget would not be available to sweeten inward investors such as BMW. Because EU money is allocated from the top down and bears no relation to the ability of individual departments to match it, the result is a misalignment of funding. Dr Pernella Kousguard of the Merseyside Policy Unit says: 'Our priority this year is business support. This is funded by the DTI. But the DTI schemes we can use for matched funding do not have enough. Yet other departments have more than we need for our training plans.' Merseyside's other priorities include infrastructure projects such as schemes at Liverpool's docks and close to Ford's Halewood plant. 'These will be funded by the Regional Development Agencies [RDAs] but they just don't have access to the funds,' says Kousguard. South Yorkshire faces similar problems. Fieldsend points out that of the \u00a3200m matched funding needed for its key priority - business support - only \u00a320m has been identified from paltry DTI funds. This means the region could end up with only \u00a340m of a possible \u00a3400m total. On top of that, only half of the \u00a3200m matched funding needed for infrastructure has been identified from RDAs. Under Objective One rules, any unmatched EU money has to be handed back to Brussels. So for every pound of matched funding missed, the region misses out on a total of \u00a32 . Figures handed to Trade and Industry Minister Richard Caborn, who last week was charged by the Objective One Group with sorting the mess out, indicate that there will be a \u00a3534m shortfall in matching funds over the six years in the English regions. This, with the equivalent EU money, means them losing more than \u00a31bn. South Yorkshire, due for \u00a3780m from the EU, will be \u00a3300m shy - a 38 per cent shortfall. Merseyside, due \u00a3844m, will fall 17 per cent, or \u00a3150m, short, and Cornwall will miss out on \u00a384m of its \u00a3315m entitlement, which is 26 per cent. And to discover the real loss to each of these regions, all of these figures must be doubled. Kousguard says: 'Liverpool is \u00a3150m short. We do not see why we should accept \u00a3690m, when the EU is prepared to make \u00a3844m available.

      "body": "<p>It's a very bad week if you work in a bank.</p> <p>At NatWest the merger with Royal Bank of Scotland will cost 21,000 jobs. Lloyds TSB, hero of the High Street, announced respectable results - and 3,000 redundancies. Even in the pure air of central banking we had the extraordinary spectacle of Bank of England staff picketing against the loss of their privileged low mortgage rates. (To do so on the day most of us had our unprivileged mortgages put up by a quarter per cent suggests a lack of PR awareness.) </p> <p>Those of us with an old-fashioned sense of equality found it rather tasteless that at the outset of the battle for NatWest the merits of rival bids seemed to revolve around how many job losses could be delivered. The ugly truth is that even 21,000 jobs from the new RBS NatWest are probably not nearly enough. (As a side issue, how will they rename it - the Royal Bank of Scottish Nationals, maybe?) And the broader problem the new entity faces is working out exactly what a retail bank will be in 10 years' time. </p> <p>If they can come to any crisp conclusion, they will have beaten everyone else to it. The financial services sector appears to be in a quandary over what a bank should provide and at what cost. When Sainsbury's - via the magic of the Bank of Scotland - can produce a profitable financial services arm within two years, and when the Pru can replace its ambitions to buy NatWest itself with its online Egg product, the traditionalists are really trying to invent a wheel which no longer fits the wagon. RBSNatWest must already be looking at its new enormous wheel and wondering if it will roll fast enough. </p> <p>The banking culture of dictating to the customer has fractured under extensive competition, but there are still aspects of our high street branch we are not ready to part with. Disappearing into cyberspace fails to solve all the problems; for starters, while the retail customer does not really need a branch, the small business does. </p> <p>One of the key challenges Don Cruickshank faces in his report on the banking sector is finding out why banks are so uncompetitive when it comes to serving small businesses. The plain truth is probably that these are the only customers who are not able, because of their requirements, to simply waltz off to Tesco with their account. The banker's motto must be converging with that of the dairy farmer: if it stands still long enough, milk it. </p> <p>Then we have the very relevant issue of social exclusion. The Government wants our banks to be competitive, but also to maintain a geographical presence in less wealthy areas to ensure that everyone can still access a bank.

      "bodyText": "It's a very bad week if you work in a bank. At NatWest the merger with Royal Bank of Scotland will cost 21,000 jobs. Lloyds TSB, hero of the High Street, announced respectable results - and 3,000 redundancies. Even in the pure air of central banking we had the extraordinary spectacle of Bank of England staff picketing against the loss of their privileged low mortgage rates. (To do so on the day most of us had our unprivileged mortgages put up by a quarter per cent suggests a lack of PR awareness.) Those of us with an old-fashioned sense of equality found it rather tasteless that at the outset of the battle for NatWest the merits of rival bids seemed to revolve around how many job losses could be delivered. The ugly truth is that even 21,000 jobs from the new RBS NatWest are probably not nearly enough. (As a side issue, how will they rename it - the Royal Bank of Scottish Nationals, maybe?) And the broader problem the new entity faces is working out exactly what a retail bank will be in 10 years' time. If they can come to any crisp conclusion, they will have beaten everyone else to it. The financial services sector appears to be in a quandary over what a bank should provide and at what cost. When Sainsbury's - via the magic of the Bank of Scotland - can produce a profitable financial services arm within two years, and when the Pru can replace its ambitions to buy NatWest itself with its online Egg product, the traditionalists are really trying to invent a wheel which no longer fits the wagon. RBSNatWest must already be looking at its new enormous wheel and wondering if it will roll fast enough. The banking culture of dictating to the customer has fractured under extensive competition, but there are still aspects of our high street branch we are not ready to part with. Disappearing into cyberspace fails to solve all the problems; for starters, while the retail customer does not really need a branch, the small business does. One of the key challenges Don Cruickshank faces in his report on the banking sector is finding out why banks are so uncompetitive when it comes to serving small businesses. The plain truth is probably that these are the only customers who are not able, because of their requirements, to simply waltz off to Tesco with their account. The banker's motto must be converging with that of the dairy farmer: if it stands still long enough, milk it. Then we have the very relevant issue of social exclusion. The Government wants our banks to be competitive, but also to maintain a geographical presence in less wealthy areas to ensure that everyone can still access a bank. Little wonder, then, that companies seeking an entr\u00e9e into financial services have followed the 'blank sheet of paper' approach rather than taking over an existing infrastructure. And while our facility with call centres, disembodied bank clerks and 24-hour banking has flourished, our experimentation with digital cash has fizzled. Soon the Mondex card will be joining the Sinclair C5 and the Squarial in the garage of failed technological innovations. We love the folding stuff - so while the branch may have to go, the cash point must stay. The 'high street bank' will become a complex fulfilment business; taking bags of notes to holes in the wall and dispatching the tea, sympathy and high charges brigade to hold the hands of budding entrepreneurs. They may even think about helping you fill in your tax form - and how much would we have paid for that emergency call-out service two weeks ago? More branches will fall into the bleached blonde wood hands of theme bar chains, packed out with twenty-somethings, waving at the barman with the the twenty pound notes they collected from a hole in the wall.

The winners are usually those who choose to focus either on the bargain basement or on the luxury market. Those in the middle just get squeezed. </p> <p>British Airways is a classic example of that. Industry overcapacity, rising fuel costs and fierce competition on fares have been squeezing its profits for much of the past two years: even the most optimistic analysts expect losses to reach \u00a3200m in the year to March. But will chief executive Bob Ayling's strategy of going upmarket produce the business school result? </p> <p>On the face of it, it is a sensible strategy. BA is trying to ditch unprofitable passengers, mainly those transferring from other airlines.

It is cutting capacity in the hope that this will leave it with fewer seats to offload at large discounts. </p> <p>The results for the three months to December provide the first evidence that the strategy may just be working. Premium traffic rose by 6.8 per cent, offsetting a 2.8 per cent fall in the numbers of other passengers. That produced the first quarterly rise in passenger yields - the all-important measure of how much BA earns per kilometre - for almost two years. The increase, 3.2 per cent, was hardly dramatic, however. </p> <p>It will still be a long hard slog. Analysts' forecasts for the year to 2001 range from breakeven to around \u00a360m.

      "body": "<p>America's best loved ice cream firm, Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, is known for supporting charities and doing good works - but has someone betrayed the company in an increasingly nasty takeover war? </p> <p>A consortium of 17 'socially responsible investors' has entered into battle to defend the principles of small and ethical business. The knights-errant include Anita Roddick, celebrity president of the Body Shop cosmetics company. Ranged against them is the might of the Anglo-Dutch food multinational Unilever NV, which already owns Breyer's ice cream, and, to add confusion to the mixture, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., based in Oakland, California. </p> <p>The consortium, brought together under the name of Meadowbrook Lane Capital, belongs to the Social Venture Network in San Francisco, a group of 400 business people who promote ethical standards for US corporations. Ben Cohen, one of the founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's, is a leading member of SVN, (though he's not in the consortium) and his partner, Jerry Greenfield, used to belong. </p> <p>The 17 are seeking to raise enough capital to make Ben &amp; Jerry's a private company again. They hope to prevent the firm's trademark quirky, Sixties flavour from becoming diluted under the impersonal management of a large corporation. </p> <p>But late last week their plan met with a setback when the details, subject to a confidentiality agreement signed by them all, were leaked to the New York Times, weeks after an earlier leak to the Wall Street Journal. The chief suspect was Ben &amp; Jerry's itself. Observers believe a disgruntled shareholder was seeking to boost the Stock Exchange price, which has languished for nearly a decade. </p> <p>'Ben &amp; Jerry's is in a bind,' said an investor who wished to remain anonymous. 'If the firm is really ethical, it has to accept the Meadowbrook terms, but under US corporate law it must also do the best financially for shareholders - and the two are not necessarily compatible.' </p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's became a sensation in the Eighties, with annual sales increases of 120 per cent in 1984, 143 per cent the following year, and 100 per cent in 1986. The company expanded into Britain in 1994, into the Benelux countries two years later, and took Japan in 1997. From its beginnings in 1978, the public fell in love with the story of two ex-hippies who starting out making homemade 'scoops' in a converted garage in Burlington, Vermont. </p> <p>They chose fun, hippy names for their flavours: Peace Pops and Cherry Garcia (after the late guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead rock group), Wavy Gravy, and, more recently, Cool Britannia. The firm was voted 'America's favourite' in an opinion poll. </p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's has already fought off a bid from Dreyer's, but Unilever is a new suitor. No one wants to comment on this new development. Neither company would answer press calls. Judy Wicks, owner and founder of the White Dog restaurant in Philadelphia, who is vice chair of the SVN group, had only this to say: 'We are very annoyed that someone breached our confidentiality agreement, but we cannot speculate on whom it might be.' </p> <p>Lovers of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream had already mounted street demonstrations against Dreyer's bids, and their prayers seemed to have been answered when Meadowbrook put in an alternative bid. It was for $32 a share - $268 million in total - and exceeded Dreyer's $31-a-share bid. But Unilever has offered $40 a share, the New York Times reported from the information 'supplied' on Meadowbrook's letterhead. </p> <p>Dreyer's has offered to run any merged company as two autonomous firms 'managed independently'. But neither Dreyer's nor Unilever has publicly committed itself to continuing Ben &amp; Jerry's social responsibility policy - the firm donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to charities, runs a foundation, and pays premium milk prices to dairy farmers in Vermont. </p> <p>The Meadowbrook 17, on the other hand, promised to make Ben &amp; Jerry's even more socially responsible. But combining business ethics with bigger profits is not turning out to be such a gratifying mixture as the 'royal medley of vanilla ice cream, strawberries, and chocolate-covered shortbread bits' that makes up Cool Britannia.</p>",

      "bodyText": "America's best loved ice cream firm, Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, is known for supporting charities and doing good works - but has someone betrayed the company in an increasingly nasty takeover war? A consortium of 17 'socially responsible investors' has entered into battle to defend the principles of small and ethical business. The knights-errant include Anita Roddick, celebrity president of the Body Shop cosmetics company. Ranged against them is the might of the Anglo-Dutch food multinational Unilever NV, which already owns Breyer's ice cream, and, to add confusion to the mixture, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., based in Oakland, California. The consortium, brought together under the name of Meadowbrook Lane Capital, belongs to the Social Venture Network in San Francisco, a group of 400 business people who promote ethical standards for US corporations. Ben Cohen, one of the founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's, is a leading member of SVN, (though he's not in the consortium) and his partner, Jerry Greenfield, used to belong. The 17 are seeking to raise enough capital to make Ben &amp; Jerry's a private company again. They hope to prevent the firm's trademark quirky, Sixties flavour from becoming diluted under the impersonal management of a large corporation. But late last week their plan met with a setback when the details, subject to a confidentiality agreement signed by them all, were leaked to the New York Times, weeks after an earlier leak to the Wall Street Journal. The chief suspect was Ben &amp; Jerry's itself. Observers believe a disgruntled shareholder was seeking to boost the Stock Exchange price, which has languished for nearly a decade. 'Ben &amp; Jerry's is in a bind,' said an investor who wished to remain anonymous. 'If the firm is really ethical, it has to accept the Meadowbrook terms, but under US corporate law it must also do the best financially for shareholders - and the two are not necessarily compatible.' Ben &amp; Jerry's became a sensation in the Eighties, with annual sales increases of 120 per cent in 1984, 143 per cent the following year, and 100 per cent in 1986. The company expanded into Britain in 1994, into the Benelux countries two years later, and took Japan in 1997. From its beginnings in 1978, the public fell in love with the story of two ex-hippies who starting out making homemade 'scoops' in a converted garage in Burlington, Vermont. They chose fun, hippy names for their flavours: Peace Pops and Cherry Garcia (after the late guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead rock group), Wavy Gravy, and, more recently, Cool Britannia. The firm was voted 'America's favourite' in an opinion poll. Ben &amp; Jerry's has already fought off a bid from Dreyer's, but Unilever is a new suitor. No one wants to comment on this new development. Neither company would answer press calls. Judy Wicks, owner and founder of the White Dog restaurant in Philadelphia, who is vice chair of the SVN group, had only this to say: 'We are very annoyed that someone breached our confidentiality agreement, but we cannot speculate on whom it might be.' Lovers of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream had already mounted street demonstrations against Dreyer's bids, and their prayers seemed to have been answered when Meadowbrook put in an alternative bid. It was for $32 a share - $268 million in total - and exceeded Dreyer's $31-a-share bid. But Unilever has offered $40 a share, the New York Times reported from the information 'supplied' on Meadowbrook's letterhead. Dreyer's has offered to run any merged company as two autonomous firms 'managed independently'. But neither Dreyer's nor Unilever has publicly committed itself to continuing Ben &amp; Jerry's social responsibility policy - the firm donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to charities, runs a foundation, and pays premium milk prices to dairy farmers in Vermont. The Meadowbrook 17, on the other hand, promised to make Ben &amp; Jerry's even more socially responsible. But combining business ethics with bigger profits is not turning out to be such a gratifying mixture as the 'royal medley of vanilla ice cream, strawberries, and chocolate-covered shortbread bits' that makes up Cool Britannia.",

      "body": "<p>The American icon left stranded by designer brands is paying the price of having followed fashion of an altogether different sort. Fruit of the Loom's future now lies firmly in the hands of an old-fashioned Brit - and a knight of the realm to boot. </p> <p>The world's biggest T-shirt maker - famous in the UK for sweatshirts emblazoned with a trademark logo synonymous with Seventies casual chic - is fighting for survival. Since the new year it has languished in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, burdened by debt, and engaged in one final attempt to stave off creditors. </p> <p>Workers around the world who have been 'downsized' or were simply handed their P45 by any large corporation may be forgiven a wry smile at the immediate cause of Fruit of the Loom's misfortune: an overhasty dash to set up in sweat shop havens such as Central America and North Africa as a way of cutting wage and tax bills at all costs. </p> <p>Struggling to cope with the 'yoof' trend for designer labels, Fruit of the Loom found the quality of its traditional fare so compromised that customers balked at buying them. Already 16,000 US workers had paid the price as factories across the US closed. Mismanagement also crossed the Atlantic: with more than 1,000 workers at five factories in Ireland lost their jobs. Four of the company's six plants there closed. </p> <p>Now the remaining 30,000 staff, employed in 60 countries, hope that Sir Brian Wolfson, the former Wembley boss installed as chairman last month, will revitalise the brand. </p> <p>'The problems are fundamentally at manufacturing level. There were problems going offshore, to Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean, too quickly,' Wolfson said in his first newspaper interview since taking control. 'It's a hugely complicated business. It may take up to two years to sort out. But Fruit of the Loom is still the world's second most dominant apparel brand after Levi's jeans.' </p> <p>The firm's 150-year history is one of US pride compromised by corporate greed. Founded in 1851, Fruit of the Loom grew from a small Rhode Island textile mill into one of the clothing world's best known brands. As well as its trademark T-shirts and sweatshirts, its white cotton briefs have clothed generations of American bottoms. The firm may never have sold a pair of knickers over here, but today it still sells 15 per cent of girl's underwear and one in three of all men's and boys' briefs in the US. </p> <p>The firm's original cotton cloth was patented in the US in 1871, the first textile product to stake its claim to exclusivity. From the late 1950s it had been under the wing of an obscure conglomerate called Philadelphia &amp; Reading. Then corporate America started to attract the vultures of Wall Street in the first great wave of restructuring. In 1985, a $1.4 billion buyout took Fruit of the Loom into the hands of Farley Industries, a swash buckling investment outfit headed by Chicago-based corporate raider William Farley. </p> <p>Farley's money came from a far from impeccable source. He was a close associate of junk bond king Michael Milken, star of the now-defunct Wall Street investment outfit Drexel Burnham Lambert. Milken was later jailed for securities fraud. </p> <p>An encyclopedia salesman-turned-financial-engineer-turned-industrialist, Farley amassed great wealth from his adventures. The owner of one of Jackie Onassis's former mansions, he also once had a grand New England home from which he would boast: 'I can see right into George Bush's beach house.' </p> <p>Fruit of the Loom was floated on the stock market in 1987. But long before the firm finally buckled last year, Farley's record had been tarnished. In 1989, he took over bedlinen-maker West-Point Pepperell, but struggled for three years, swamped by debt and against fierce staff resistance, before creditors seized control. </p> <p>He also defaulted on debts after a buyout of Condec Corp, a defence contractor. By last year, after the mishandled moves overseas (including a change of registered office to the Cayman Islands) Farley's lifestyle was also contributing to Fruit of the Loom's problems. </p> <p>Included in the $1.6bn that the company owes to its banks and creditors is a $65 million guarantee given by Fruit of the Loom to secure one of Farley's personal debts. In court filings, the company has also sought to cancel a $27m severance and retirement package Farley secured from Fruit of the Loom last year. After a string of profit warnings and a $625m refinancing by Bank of America, Farley's greed was enough to push the firm over the edge. </p> <p>After being reined in last August, he remains on the board but was finally pushed out of day-to-day operations when Wolfson was appointed a month ago. The Wembley veteran has been on the board since 1992, but insists he has the crucial confidence of the banks. 'During the restructuring, lots of changes have been demanded by the banks,' he says. 'The firm needed an independent non-executive director at the helm, and I was really the only one who fitted the bill.' </p> <p>At present the firm is barely solvent: it has - according to Wolfson - $2bn of assets against a total $1.7bn of liabilities. In the third quarter last year, losses reached $166m. This was its fifth consecutive quarter in the red. Sales nonetheless still run at $2bn a year, and with only 10 per cent of them in Europe, Wolfson is now looking to expand here. </p> <p>As part of the Chapter 11 restructuring, Wolfson now has some breathing space until the end of this year to push through radical change. </p> <p>In Ireland, the 1,700 workers at Fruit of the Loom's two remaining plants, in Derry and Donegal, hope the Englishman finally brings them peace of mind.</p> <p><strong>Colour and controversy on the road to Wembley</strong></p> <p>Sir Brian Wolfson, Fruit of the Loom's unlikely new chairman, is used to flying by the seat of his pants. Best known for the 10 years he spent running Wembley - the former owner of the national football stadium - he is a survivor and a ducker'n'diver. </p> <p>He left Wembley in 1995 - part of the price of a \u00a3140 million rescue - and now numbers Playboy Enterprises, a gambling equipment firm and a supplier of natural health foods among his eclectic US interests. And Wolfson, veteran of many a corporate battle, has no plans to return to Britain. </p> <p>'I'm 64 now,' he said from Chicago. 'There's plenty enough to keep me busy over here. You can't go round the world forever at my age.' </p> <p>Born in Liverpool in 1935, Wolfson joined the family motor business straight from school at 15. His big break came during a property venture 10 years later when he attracted the eye of Sidney Bernstein, legendary founder of the Granada TV group. After seven years with Bernstein, Wolfson, by then 32, rose to become the youngest managing director of Granada TV rentals. In 1971 he left to seek his fortune in the US and Asia, before cropping up in the freewheeling early Eighties as chairman of stock market-quoted engineer Anglo-Nordic Holdings. </p> <p>In 1982, Wolfson had a well-publicised run-in with the Takeover Panel during Anglo-Nordic's controversial bid for rival engineer Braby Leslie. In parallel to his City career, Wolfson rapidly climbed the Establishment ladder, serving on 'Neddy', the old National Economic Development Council, and, from 1993, as chairman of Investors in People. One of Lady Thatcher's favourite businessmen, he was knighted in 1990 for services to training. </p> <p>That assiduous networking led in 1985 to his first involvement with Wembley, through work on the unsuccessful British bid for the 1992 Olympics. </p> <p>Wolfson floated Wembley in 1987, right in the middle of the October stock market crash. Equally inauspiciously, he set about rapid expansion by snapping up greyhound tracks in the UK and US, discotheques, bingo clubs, ticketing and hospitality firms and a film company. In 1989 he was beaten by Ladbroke in a \u00a3200m bid for Vernons pools. </p> <p>By 1990, as recession struck hard, Wembley's debts had grown to \u00a3120m and the next five years were spent unravelling the deals to pay off the loans. In 1995, under pressure from its bankers, Wembley installed as chief executive Claes Hultman, a no-nonsense Swede, who ran down the curtain on the Wolfson era. Along the way, Wolf son had gathered some equally controversial characters around him, including impresario Jarvis Astaire, and Tony Clegg, founder of the now-defunct Mountleigh property group. Wembley tried to merge with Mountleigh a year after flotation, but the talks were called off. </p> <p>Other colourful characters stalked the Wembley wings through links with United Dutch Group (UDG), a major Wembley shareholder of which Wolfson was a director. A secretive Netherlands-based investment company, UDG was originally owned by Sasea, the defunct vehicle of jailed Italian financier Florio Fiorini, who tried to buy Hollywood studio MGM. </p> <p>UDG was bought in 1989 by property trader Paul Bloomfield - who, with Alton Towers owner John Broome, tried and failed to redevelop Battersea power station - before passing to a Wolfson consortium. </p> <p>UDG collapsed in 1993, but not before it helped to bankrupt Lord Beaverbrook, following a Guyanan forestry deal. There were never any allegations of wrongdoing by Wolfson. </p> <p>The combative Liverpudlian continuously added to his US interests throughout, gaining a reputation as one of British Airways' most frequent transatlantic flyers. </p> <p>Now Wolfson is hoping to spare Fruit of the Loom the unhappy end met by his last UK involvement after Wembley. Installed in 1996 as chairman of Colorvision, a foundering northern TV rental chain, he was too late to prevent its collapse three months later. </p> <p> <strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Sir Brian Wolfson </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 64 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chairman, Fruit of the Loom </p> <p><strong> Other Directorships: </strong> Playboy, Autotote, National Health Trends Corp, Kepner Tregoe Inc </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Work, investing and travel</p>",

Best known for the 10 years he spent running Wembley - the former owner of the national football stadium - he is a survivor and a ducker'n'diver. He left Wembley in 1995 - part of the price of a \u00a3140 million rescue - and now numbers Playboy Enterprises, a gambling equipment firm and a supplier of natural health foods among his eclectic US interests. And Wolfson, veteran of many a corporate battle, has no plans to return to Britain. 'I'm 64 now,' he said from Chicago. 'There's plenty enough to keep me busy over here. You can't go round the world forever at my age.' Born in Liverpool in 1935, Wolfson joined the family motor business straight from school at 15. His big break came during a property venture 10 years later when he attracted the eye of Sidney Bernstein, legendary founder of the Granada TV group. After seven years with Bernstein, Wolfson, by then 32, rose to become the youngest managing director of Granada TV rentals. In 1971 he left to seek his fortune in the US and Asia, before cropping up in the freewheeling early Eighties as chairman of stock market-quoted engineer Anglo-Nordic Holdings. In 1982, Wolfson had a well-publicised run-in with the Takeover Panel during Anglo-Nordic's controversial bid for rival engineer Braby Leslie. In parallel to his City career, Wolfson rapidly climbed the Establishment ladder, serving on 'Neddy', the old National Economic Development Council, and, from 1993, as chairman of Investors in People. One of Lady Thatcher's favourite businessmen, he was knighted in 1990 for services to training. That assiduous networking led in 1985 to his first involvement with Wembley, through work on the unsuccessful British bid for the 1992 Olympics. Wolfson floated Wembley in 1987, right in the middle of the October stock market crash. Equally inauspiciously, he set about rapid expansion by snapping up greyhound tracks in the UK and US, discotheques, bingo clubs, ticketing and hospitality firms and a film company. In 1989 he was beaten by Ladbroke in a \u00a3200m bid for Vernons pools. By 1990, as recession struck hard, Wembley's debts had grown to \u00a3120m and the next five years were spent unravelling the deals to pay off the loans. In 1995, under pressure from its bankers, Wembley installed as chief executive Claes Hultman, a no-nonsense Swede, who ran down the curtain on the Wolfson era. Along the way, Wolf son had gathered some equally controversial characters around him, including impresario Jarvis Astaire, and Tony Clegg, founder of the now-defunct Mountleigh property group. Wembley tried to merge with Mountleigh a year after flotation, but the talks were called off. Other colourful characters stalked the Wembley wings through links with United Dutch Group (UDG), a major Wembley shareholder of which Wolfson was a director. A secretive Netherlands-based investment company, UDG was originally owned by Sasea, the defunct vehicle of jailed Italian financier Florio Fiorini, who tried to buy Hollywood studio MGM. UDG was bought in 1989 by property trader Paul Bloomfield - who, with Alton Towers owner John Broome, tried and failed to redevelop Battersea power station - before passing to a Wolfson consortium. UDG collapsed in 1993, but not before it helped to bankrupt Lord Beaverbrook, following a Guyanan forestry deal. There were never any allegations of wrongdoing by Wolfson. The combative Liverpudlian continuously added to his US interests throughout, gaining a reputation as one of British Airways' most frequent transatlantic flyers. Now Wolfson is hoping to spare Fruit of the Loom the unhappy end met by his last UK involvement after Wembley. Installed in 1996 as chairman of Colorvision, a foundering northern TV rental chain, he was too late to prevent its collapse three months later.

      "body": "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer was fed up with the uncertainty. For almost two months it had been under public threat of takeover and it wanted the matter settled. Would its tormentor bid? Or would he be forced to go away? </p> <p>It was Wednesday 2 February. After lunch, three men trooped into the Stock Exchange building in the heart of the City and took the lift to the twentieth floor. One was Graham Oakley, M&amp;S's company secretary. The second was Piers de Montfort, from investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The third was Andy Ryde, from M&amp;S's City law firm, Slaughter &amp; May. </p> <p>They were to appear before the City's Takeover Panel - a body that has no legal status, but which sets rules and acts as arbiter when one company bids, or threatens to bid, for another. </p> <p>That Wednesday gathering was seen as the 'put up or shut up' meeting. Philip Green, the Monaco-based entrepreneur who made a fortune breaking up Sears in 1999, had announced on 13 December that he was considering a bid for M&amp;S. </p> <p>Now, said M&amp;S, it was time for Green to be forced to show his hand. He had already said publicly that he had investment bank Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ) at his side. Its people were there to help devise a structure and find the financing for an \u00a38 billion-plus bid for M&amp;S. And Green's allies said a number of well-known faces in the retailing world - Allan Leighton of Asda, Terry Green of Debenhams and Richard North, who worked for Burton before moving to Bass - were lined up to take key roles in a bid consortium. </p> <p>So, M&amp;S argued that Wednesday, if all this was were true - and given that it was nearly eight weeks since Green first raised his head - he must get on with it. Or he should admit that the bid wasn't going to get off the ground and he would leave M&amp;S alone. (Under City convention, that would mean him having to wait 12 months before any fresh bid.) </p> <p>The panel listened patiently to M&amp;S. But Oakley, de Montfort and Ryde knew they had little chance of securing a quick result. There were unhelpful precedents: a decade ago, for example, when Storehouse was the subject of the nagging attentions of an American raider, the would-be bidder had been allowed month upon month to come up with an offer. And they knew that DLJ would argue that more time was needed because Christmas had slowed things down. M&amp;S privately conceded that the best it might hope for was that the panel would set a cut-off point for a Green bid - perhaps tomorrow. </p> <p>But even before the meeting started the M&amp;S team scented blood. At last, the company might have the ammunition to fire the first volley in a counter-attack. And it had nothing to do with the panel. </p> <p>Until then, M&amp;S had been relatively content to let the Green story run. The company had undoubtedly looked vulnerable - because of its awful recent trading record and because it had been without a permanent chairman. M&amp;S had long decided that it wanted Luc Vandevelde, formerly of Promod\u00e8s, to take the post. </p> <p>But negotiations to compensate him for the loss of money on share options and thus extricate him from his previous job were protracted. A deal was struck and an announcement made only on 24 January. With the chairmanship now sorted out, M&amp;S was ready to step up a gear and go on the attack. </p> <p>Late in January, M&amp;S sent out a number of '212 notices'. These documents - their name comes from section 212 of the Companies Act - give a company the right to find out who owns its shares. On 28 January, M&amp;S wrote to Philip Green: did he have any M&amp;S shares? </p> <p>Green replied promptly. And by the time the M&amp;S threesome arrived at the Takeover Panel's offices five days later, they knew that his reply could be dynamite. </p> <p>Green said he had no shares in M&amp;S. But his wife Cristina did. In the week leading up to his 13 December announcement of his interest in the company, she had invested the best part of \u00a325 million in M&amp;S. </p> <p>There was nothing wrong in that as such. People often buy shares in companies for which they are considering launching a bid. It gives a toehold before the whole world knows what is going on. </p> <p>But legally they can buy shares in anticipation of a bid only if they are in a 'concert party' - a group which does the bidding. In that way they don't profit personally from the inevitable share price rise when a bid materialises. The curiosity in Green's 212 reply was that it said quite explicitly that Cristina Green was the sole beneficial owner of the shares. And Green said 'neither I nor any of the other persons disclosed by this letter are party to any agreement to which section 204 of the [Companies] Act applies'. Section 204 covers concert parties. </p> <p>After Green's reply had arrived in M&amp;S's company secretary's office, it was forwarded to Slaughter &amp; May. The lawyers pounced on the implication of his apparent denial that his wife was in a concert party. </p> <p>The issue was first raised by M&amp;S with the panel on that Wednesday of the 'put up or shut up' meeting. By the end of the week, M&amp;S had been told that the panel thought there was no problem: according to the Green camp, his wife's share deals had been cleared by them before she bought. The panel accepted Green's assertion that she was part of a concert party. </p> <p>M&amp;S immediately saw the potential of Green's letter. The panel may or may not have thought that everything was hunky-dory and complied with its code, but under the Companies Act, Green appeared to have a problem. </p> <p>According to a briefing drawn up by Slaughter &amp; May on 4 February, Green should have informed M&amp;S that his wife's holding in 'Campbell'- the code-word used for M&amp;S - was part of a concert party. </p> <p>That evening, M&amp;S and its advisers attacked. The Observer and one other Sunday newspaper got hold of Green's 212 reply. M&amp;S said the issue would be raised with the Stock Exchange. The gloves came off. </p> <p>On Saturday evening, Green telephoned his lawyers. They in turn contacted The Observer. They quoted sections of the Companies Act. 'This section [204] does not apply to an agreement which is not legally binding unless it involves mutuality in the undertakings, expectations or understandings of the parties to it,' said Green's lawyer, so he had stuck by the letter of the Act. </p> <p>The legal prose was, of course, crystal clear and a ravishing read. But it didn't answer the point - whether Cristina Green's involvement in a concert party should have been declared. Green was more succinct: he threatened to sue. </p> <p>From then on, Green and his advisers - DLJ and broker WestLB Panmure - were deluged with legal challenges to their replies to 212 notices. </p> <p>Slaughter &amp; May handed details of all its challenges to the Department of Trade, the Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Authority. On Monday evening, Green issued a statement: he had done nothing wrong and he and his wife had complied 'with all the relevant laws and regulations'. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, his lawyers at Titmuss Sainer Dechart were less forthright. Should the concert party have been declared in Green's 212 reply? 'The matter is not free from doubt,' it said in a letter. </p> <p>By Tuesday, the lawyerly spat had turned into a parody of legal life. </p> <p>In one particularly acid exchange between solicitors, Slaughter &amp; May wrote to Titmuss Sainer: 'Section 204... requires disclosure where there is an agreement between \"two or more persons\". You presumably accept that Mr Green is a person and that Mrs Green is a separate person.' </p> <p>In the event, Green quickly folded his hand. His idea of buying M&amp;S - code-named 'Project Mushroom' - was abandoned in the early hours of Thursday. He complained - as he had when stories about his wife's shares appeared - that he suffered 'an unjustified attempt to discredit me'. </p> <p>M&amp;S's share price, meanwhile, fell to its lowest for nine years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here's a question that may be worth at least half a million of Chris Tarrant's money: who are Professor Fabian Monds, Roger Jones and Sir Robert Smith? Here's a clue: they represent one quarter of the board which is responsible for the most powerful cultural organisation in Britain and which recently appointed its chief executive. </p> <p>More importantly, if you have read any of the shrill denunciations of the past few weeks, they and their fellow board members failed dismally in their public duty by not imposing certain pre-conditions on their appointee. </p> <p>The men are three of the BBC's 12 governors, the new chief executive was director-general Greg Dyke, and the problem was his shareholding in a rival broadcaster. </p> <p>There are other more recognisable names on the board - Sir Richard Eyre and Heather Rabatts might have jogged a few memories - but beyond the ubiquitous Sir Christopher Bland, the BBC board of governors is hardly a body packed with household names. </p> <p>Their apparent failure to insist that Dyke dispose of all shares unconditionally and immediately on his appointment has again raised questions about how exactly the BBC should be run, and by whom. The announcement of a broadcasting White Paper by the end of the year will revive the issue of the BBC's constitutional position. </p> <p>The 12 BBC governors - currently eight men and four women - have a monumental task. They are, in official jargon, 'trustees for the public interest'. Their task was spelt out in more detail by the BBC's most recent Royal Charter, in 1996. It states that governors must 'determine the strategy of the corporation in the manner they consider best calculated to ensure that the corporation's services, programmes and other activities reflect the needs and interests of the public.' </p> <p>Their more detailed obligations now include the annual approval of a statement of promises and the monitoring of performance. The usual shorthand is to say that the board of governors determines the BBC's strategic role, while its director-general and its senior managers - all accountable to the board - carry out day-to-day management tasks. This raises two fundamental questions for the twenty-first century. </p> <p>First, can one really distinguish in practice between a strategy and a daily management decision? If several million pounds of licence payers' money is to be invested in a new costume drama, that is presumably of such strategic significance to the direction of their corporation that it needs at least to be run past the governing board. But at what point and at what level of expenditure should such decisions be delegated without reference upwards? </p> <p>Other changes are more subtle and incremental. A gradual shift, for example, in one Radio 2 DJ's playlist to include more 'golden oldies' and therefore, perhaps, to compete more directly with some of the commercial AM stations, is a matter of day-to-day decision making. But it may have important implications for a commercial station's profits. </p> <p>This leads directly to the second question. In a world where everyone talks about convergence and the need for a coherent regulatory strategy, is it appropriate that the BBC should remain independent of any regulatory structure for the whole communications industry? Given the imminence of another tranche of communications law-making - not to mention the Independent Television Commission's barely concealed desire to take over the regulatory function of the BBC - shouldn't we now be looking to bring these 12 part-timers under some kind of super-regulator's umbrella? If nothing else, the strategic programming decisions can then be seen within a communications context wider than the BBC alone. </p> <p>It is quite explicitly not the BBC's job to fit itself around the output of commercial competitors; it should provide a comprehensive service of its own. How it does this, how distinctive it should be from its rivals, where it should compete head on and where it should avoid competition, are all difficult strategic and management questions. But their resolution does not lie in giving away the BBC's regulatory function to a body which must also remain sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the commercial sector. </p> <p>Just think for a minute about issues such as bidding for sports rights or introducing more episodes of a popular soap opera. Both would be justifiable BBC decisions on the grounds that it is vital to cement licence payers' affection for an organisation to which they all subscribe. Both would be bitterly contested by commercial competitors, who would vigorously lobby their common regulator. Operationally, it simply would not work to have a public body and its commercial rivals accountable to the same people. </p> <p>Which leaves us with the question of whether the present constitutional set-up for the BBC is right. Any system that combines strategic management with public accountability is going to be messy - and there have been times when the calibre of those involved has called the whole edifice into question. This was particularly true in the Eighties, when the board was packed with Thatcherite second-raters. </p> <p>The issue, then, is about ensuring a high-calibre governing board with sufficient awareness of the traditions and purpose of the BBC. It is unfair to question the calibre of the present incumbents simply because they got the shares question wrong. However, if they had been subjected before the appointment to a rigorous and transparent interrogation by the public's representative body - Parliament - this would have strengthened their position and forced them to think about these issues more carefully </p> <p>While I would hesitate before giving any parliamentary select committee the power to appoint BBC governors, let alone one headed by Gerald Kaufman, it may be more democratic if a selection of aspirants were at least publicly questioned by the Media and Culture Select Committee. Thus, the public trustees of the BBC would themselves have been accountable to Parliament. And some bright spark MP could have asked each of them what a would-be director-general should do with his share portfolio. </p> <p> <strong>Who's who in Portland Place </strong></p> <p><strong> The current Governors?</strong> </p> <p>Chairman: Sir Christopher Bland; Vice-chair: Baroness Young of Old Scone; National Governor for Scotland: Sir Robert Smith (chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management); National Governor for Northern Ireland: Professor Fabian Monds; National Governor for Wales: Roger Jones (chairman of Penn Pharmaceuticals); Chair, English National Forum: Ranjit Sondhi (Birmingham college lecturer). </p> <p>Other members: Sir Richard Eyre (former National Theatre director); Adrian White (chairman of Biwater); Dame Pauline Neville-Jones (diplomat turned banker); Tony Young (Communica tion Workers' Union), Heather Rabbatts (chief executive of Lambeth Council); Baroness Hogg (journalist and thinktanker) </p> <p><strong> So how do I get to be a Governor - apart from already having a title?</strong> </p> <p>Jobs are scrupulously advertised as the 12-strong board rotates. The appointment is made by The Crown. Her Majesty does not actually get out her drawing pin and list of names herself - she will of course have her hand guided by the chairman of the governors, with just a touch of input from leading politicians. </p> <p><strong> How much does it pay?</strong> </p> <p>\u00a39,250 pa. Governors are expected to attend monthly meetings.</p> <p>\u0095 Steven Barnett is co-author of the 'The Battle for the BBC' and senior lecturer in communications at the University of Westminster. </p>",

Here's a clue: they represent one quarter of the board which is responsible for the most powerful cultural organisation in Britain and which recently appointed its chief executive. More importantly, if you have read any of the shrill denunciations of the past few weeks, they and their fellow board members failed dismally in their public duty by not imposing certain pre-conditions on their appointee. The men are three of the BBC's 12 governors, the new chief executive was director-general Greg Dyke, and the problem was his shareholding in a rival broadcaster. There are other more recognisable names on the board - Sir Richard Eyre and Heather Rabatts might have jogged a few memories - but beyond the ubiquitous Sir Christopher Bland, the BBC board of governors is hardly a body packed with household names. Their apparent failure to insist that Dyke dispose of all shares unconditionally and immediately on his appointment has again raised questions about how exactly the BBC should be run, and by whom. The announcement of a broadcasting White Paper by the end of the year will revive the issue of the BBC's constitutional position. The 12 BBC governors - currently eight men and four women - have a monumental task. They are, in official jargon, 'trustees for the public interest'. Their task was spelt out in more detail by the BBC's most recent Royal Charter, in 1996. It states that governors must 'determine the strategy of the corporation in the manner they consider best calculated to ensure that the corporation's services, programmes and other activities reflect the needs and interests of the public.' Their more detailed obligations now include the annual approval of a statement of promises and the monitoring of performance. The usual shorthand is to say that the board of governors determines the BBC's strategic role, while its director-general and its senior managers - all accountable to the board - carry out day-to-day management tasks. This raises two fundamental questions for the twenty-first century. First, can one really distinguish in practice between a strategy and a daily management decision? If several million pounds of licence payers' money is to be invested in a new costume drama, that is presumably of such strategic significance to the direction of their corporation that it needs at least to be run past the governing board. But at what point and at what level of expenditure should such decisions be delegated without reference upwards? Other changes are more subtle and incremental. A gradual shift, for example, in one Radio 2 DJ's playlist to include more 'golden oldies' and therefore, perhaps, to compete more directly with some of the commercial AM stations, is a matter of day-to-day decision making. But it may have important implications for a commercial station's profits. This leads directly to the second question. In a world where everyone talks about convergence and the need for a coherent regulatory strategy, is it appropriate that the BBC should remain independent of any regulatory structure for the whole communications industry? Given the imminence of another tranche of communications law-making - not to mention the Independent Television Commission's barely concealed desire to take over the regulatory function of the BBC - shouldn't we now be looking to bring these 12 part-timers under some kind of super-regulator's umbrella? If nothing else, the strategic programming decisions can then be seen within a communications context wider than the BBC alone. It is quite explicitly not the BBC's job to fit itself around the output of commercial competitors; it should provide a comprehensive service of its own. How it does this, how distinctive it should be from its rivals, where it should compete head on and where it should avoid competition, are all difficult strategic and management questions. But their resolution does not lie in giving away the BBC's regulatory function to a body which must also remain sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the commercial sector. Just think for a minute about issues such as bidding for sports rights or introducing more episodes of a popular soap opera. Both would be justifiable BBC decisions on the grounds that it is vital to cement licence payers' affection for an organisation to which they all subscribe. Both would be bitterly contested by commercial competitors, who would vigorously lobby their common regulator. Operationally, it simply would not work to have a public body and its commercial rivals accountable to the same people. Which leaves us with the question of whether the present constitutional set-up for the BBC is right. Any system that combines strategic management with public accountability is going to be messy - and there have been times when the calibre of those involved has called the whole edifice into question. This was particularly true in the Eighties, when the board was packed with Thatcherite second-raters. The issue, then, is about ensuring a high-calibre governing board with sufficient awareness of the traditions and purpose of the BBC. It is unfair to question the calibre of the present incumbents simply because they got the shares question wrong. However, if they had been subjected before the appointment to a rigorous and transparent interrogation by the public's representative body - Parliament - this would have strengthened their position and forced them to think about these issues more carefully While I would hesitate before giving any parliamentary select committee the power to appoint BBC governors, let alone one headed by Gerald Kaufman, it may be more democratic if a selection of aspirants were at least publicly questioned by the Media and Culture Select Committee. Thus, the public trustees of the BBC would themselves have been accountable to Parliament. And some bright spark MP could have asked each of them what a would-be director-general should do with his share portfolio. Who's who in Portland Place The current Governors? Chairman: Sir Christopher Bland; Vice-chair: Baroness Young of Old Scone; National Governor for Scotland: Sir Robert Smith (chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management); National Governor for Northern Ireland: Professor Fabian Monds; National Governor for Wales: Roger Jones (chairman of Penn Pharmaceuticals); Chair, English National Forum: Ranjit Sondhi (Birmingham college lecturer). Other members: Sir Richard Eyre (former National Theatre director); Adrian White (chairman of Biwater); Dame Pauline Neville-Jones (diplomat turned banker); Tony Young (Communica tion Workers' Union), Heather Rabbatts (chief executive of Lambeth Council); Baroness Hogg (journalist and thinktanker) So how do I get to be a Governor - apart from already having a title? Jobs are scrupulously advertised as the 12-strong board rotates. The appointment is made by The Crown. Her Majesty does not actually get out her drawing pin and list of names herself - she will of course have her hand guided by the chairman of the governors, with just a touch of input from leading politicians. How much does it pay? \u00a39,250 pa. Governors are expected to attend monthly meetings. \u0095 Steven Barnett is co-author of the 'The Battle for the BBC' and senior lecturer in communications at the University of Westminster.",

The signal that things were out of control was not a Bank forecast suggesting that inflation could rise above 2.5 per cent in two years' time; inflation in those bad old days was always going to be above 2.5 per cent in two years' time.</p> <p>No, the signal was usually a deteriorating trade balance and a sterling crisis. It took an awful lot of deterioration in various economic indicators for chancellors to be persuaded a rise was necessary. </p> <p>The approach was: better, when the time comes, to raise interest rates sharply, and show that we mean business. Later, one could gently test the market with a gradual easing of rates. Reductions of half a percentage point were much in vogue; it became boldly experimental to move rates by a mere quarter point. </p> <p>But this was when rates were on the way down. Between them the present Chancellor and his quasi-independent Bank of England (the Bank cannot choose the most important item of all, the inflation target itself) have altered traditional market tactics. Instead of a sharp rise followed by gentle reductions, we now have a series of gentle rises, in circumstances where the markets know there is more to come; and sterling, already too strong for the health of the real economy, becomes even stronger. </p> <p>It took the Chancellor and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 13 months to raise interest rates by 1.5 percentage points during the inflation scare of 1997-98. The last rise during this phase (a quarter point to 7.5 per cent on 4 June 1998) took place in the face of accumulating evidence that industrial confidence was on the verge of collapse. </p> <p>There were six increases of a quarter percentage point between May 1997 and June 1998. During this period the financial markets knew they were on a one-way bet with both sterling and interest rates: high rates of return, and a rising pound. Despite the general belief that the pound was overvalued at DM2.80, it ended at DM2.90. True, it fluctuated, but the broad thrust of the movement was one way. </p> <p>Then came the MPC's belated recognition that it risked engineering a recession, which would not go down too well with many people, including the MPC's creator, one Gordon Brown. So the august body embarked on a series of rate reductions: having led her troops up the hill, the Grand Old Duchess of Threadneedle Street led them down again, to 5 per cent on 10 June 1999. </p> <p>It was not long before there was panic in the ranks and the Duchess started marching her troops up again. But there was dancing in the streets: you could hardly move in London for cranes. Cheap money had brought the property speculators out in force: I swear that in Clerkenwell, where the Observer is now situated, they were advertising Ground Floor Loft Apartments, at prices a lot nearer the sky than the said apartments. </p> <p>Between 10 June 1999 (when rates had been reduced to 5 per cent) and the beginning of this month (when rates had risen to 5.75 per cent) the great sterling one-way bet had progressed from DM2.91 to DM3.19. At one stage this month it was DM3.25. This has been the background to the chorus of voices from industry saying the strong pound is hurting. </p> <p>I include foreign-owned British industry. Many 'inward' investors went out of their way to assuage fears that they were putting up 'screwdriver' plants through a show of integrating with the local community and 'buying British'. </p> <p>But, in common with our home-grown Marks &amp; Spencer, Japanese and other companies here have been forced by the strength of the pound to look overseas for cheaper sources of supply. Despite this, monetary policy has continued to keep the pound strong. </p> <p>The Government and the MPC profess to be mystified by the strength of sterling, but given the level of interest rates and the tactics employed, this observer is not at all surprised. Small increases do not seem overpoweringly efficacious in slowing down the economy, but this 'gradualism' does a lot of harm to the manufacturing base. This brings us to the latest little rate rise, preceded by an interview with the Chancellor in the Times which was presented as 'Interest rates should rise, says Brown.' So much, it seems, for the Chancellor's professed belief that these decisions should be apolitical. </p> <p>My good friend's actual words were more circumspect: 'I would support the Bank of England in the difficult decisions it has to take. It is important to recognise that the economy is now growing and that we do not want to fall into the mistakes of the late 1980s. We are determined to avoid the problem of stop-go which bedevilled the economy in every previous cycle.' </p> <p>Nevertheless it would no doubt suit even an Iron Chancellor if all the prospective rate rises were out of the way this year, so that the Duchess could march them down in time for election year. </p> <p>But this does not solve the problem of what to do about a situation in which interest rates keep rising, not because sterling is weak, but in order to control a boom which is barely being experienced by manufacturing. </p> <p>We have a sterling crisis, but it is one of putative strength.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the bad old days the Bank of England would tell the Chancellor that things were getting out of control, and the latter would reluctantly agree to a sharp rise in interest rates. The signal that things were out of control was not a Bank forecast suggesting that inflation could rise above 2.5 per cent in two years' time; inflation in those bad old days was always going to be above 2.5 per cent in two years' time. No, the signal was usually a deteriorating trade balance and a sterling crisis. It took an awful lot of deterioration in various economic indicators for chancellors to be persuaded a rise was necessary. The approach was: better, when the time comes, to raise interest rates sharply, and show that we mean business. Later, one could gently test the market with a gradual easing of rates. Reductions of half a percentage point were much in vogue; it became boldly experimental to move rates by a mere quarter point. But this was when rates were on the way down. Between them the present Chancellor and his quasi-independent Bank of England (the Bank cannot choose the most important item of all, the inflation target itself) have altered traditional market tactics. Instead of a sharp rise followed by gentle reductions, we now have a series of gentle rises, in circumstances where the markets know there is more to come; and sterling, already too strong for the health of the real economy, becomes even stronger. It took the Chancellor and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 13 months to raise interest rates by 1.5 percentage points during the inflation scare of 1997-98. The last rise during this phase (a quarter point to 7.5 per cent on 4 June 1998) took place in the face of accumulating evidence that industrial confidence was on the verge of collapse. There were six increases of a quarter percentage point between May 1997 and June 1998. During this period the financial markets knew they were on a one-way bet with both sterling and interest rates: high rates of return, and a rising pound. Despite the general belief that the pound was overvalued at DM2.80, it ended at DM2.90. True, it fluctuated, but the broad thrust of the movement was one way. Then came the MPC's belated recognition that it risked engineering a recession, which would not go down too well with many people, including the MPC's creator, one Gordon Brown. So the august body embarked on a series of rate reductions: having led her troops up the hill, the Grand Old Duchess of Threadneedle Street led them down again, to 5 per cent on 10 June 1999. It was not long before there was panic in the ranks and the Duchess started marching her troops up again. But there was dancing in the streets: you could hardly move in London for cranes. Cheap money had brought the property speculators out in force: I swear that in Clerkenwell, where the Observer is now situated, they were advertising Ground Floor Loft Apartments, at prices a lot nearer the sky than the said apartments. Between 10 June 1999 (when rates had been reduced to 5 per cent) and the beginning of this month (when rates had risen to 5.75 per cent) the great sterling one-way bet had progressed from DM2.91 to DM3.19. At one stage this month it was DM3.25. This has been the background to the chorus of voices from industry saying the strong pound is hurting. I include foreign-owned British industry. Many 'inward' investors went out of their way to assuage fears that they were putting up 'screwdriver' plants through a show of integrating with the local community and 'buying British'. But, in common with our home-grown Marks &amp; Spencer, Japanese and other companies here have been forced by the strength of the pound to look overseas for cheaper sources of supply. Despite this, monetary policy has continued to keep the pound strong. The Government and the MPC profess to be mystified by the strength of sterling, but given the level of interest rates and the tactics employed, this observer is not at all surprised. Small increases do not seem overpoweringly efficacious in slowing down the economy, but this 'gradualism' does a lot of harm to the manufacturing base. This brings us to the latest little rate rise, preceded by an interview with the Chancellor in the Times which was presented as 'Interest rates should rise, says Brown.' So much, it seems, for the Chancellor's professed belief that these decisions should be apolitical. My good friend's actual words were more circumspect: 'I would support the Bank of England in the difficult decisions it has to take. It is important to recognise that the economy is now growing and that we do not want to fall into the mistakes of the late 1980s. We are determined to avoid the problem of stop-go which bedevilled the economy in every previous cycle.' Nevertheless it would no doubt suit even an Iron Chancellor if all the prospective rate rises were out of the way this year, so that the Duchess could march them down in time for election year. But this does not solve the problem of what to do about a situation in which interest rates keep rising, not because sterling is weak, but in order to control a boom which is barely being experienced by manufacturing. We have a sterling crisis, but it is one of putative strength.",
