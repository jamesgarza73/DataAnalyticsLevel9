      "bodyText": "Why was breast cancer screening introduced? Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among British women under 50. It's estimated that one in eleven women will develop it by the time they reach the age of 85. Women with advanced breast cancer usually have to undergo a mastectomy - the surgical removal of their breast. But if the cancer is detected early enough, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be enough to put it into remission. Screening was introduced in 1988 for women between 50 and 64, and in 1998 1.2 million had mammograms. Of those, 5.9 per 1000 had cancer. While all women are encouraged to check their breasts regularly for lumps or abnormalities, growths of less than 15mm can't be detected by touch. The great advantage of screening is that it spots any growth at a very early stage. Of the 6,914 cancers detected by mammogram in 1998, 2,419 would otherwise have gone unnoticed. What happens during a breast scan? A woman's breasts are X-rayed to produce a mammogram. You can see some examples, both benign and malignant, at Oxford university's online mammographic image database. How much does the programme cost? In 1998 it cost \u00a337 million, or roughly \u00a325 for each woman. Has the number of deaths fallen since it began? Yes, although screening is probably only one factor in the drop. Between 1989 and 1998, the number of women dying from breast cancer fell by 14%. Britain still has a higher mortality rate than the rest of Western Europe. Do other countries screen too? Yes. Canada, Sweden, Holland and the United States are among the countries with screening programmes. US researchers say that it prevents 6 breast cancer deaths in every 10,000 women between 50 and 70. So why does the Lancet medical journal think it a waste of time? The study (which you can read online from the evening of 7 January) looked at eight existing screening trials in Sweden, Canada, Scotland and the US which are used to justify the programmes. It criticised the lack of reliable 'control groups' in six of them, and also found that while the mortality rate from breast cancer did fall, the screened women were more likely to have died from other causes. They concluded that even if the trials were unbiased, no lives were saved by screening; and if they were not reliable, there was certainly no evidence that it cut mortality rates. Professor Michel Baum of the Royal Free in London claims that it is new cancer treatments that have cut mortality rates, not screening programmes. Who still supports screening? The NHS Breast Cancer Screening Programme, of course, who expect to save around 1,250 lives each year 'at a conservative estimate'. The Lancet's interpretation and methodology is, they say, 'open to question'. The Cancer Research Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer also endorsed the programme, pointing out that early detection very often meant that women could avoid mastectomies and aggressive treatments. Dutch doctor Harry de Koning has commented that screening evaluations can only take place over a long period. He says breast cancers are certainly being detected earlier through the programmes. What will happen to the screening programme now? More research is certainly needed, and the NHS Screening Programme will release new figures later this year. However, it would be difficult for the government to deny women mammograms on the NHS. It may be that women are put off screening. But while the recent scares over cervical smears were due to medical errors - lab staff overlooked malignant smears - the Lancet research questions the validity of the entire screening programme. It may be that the focus will shift to better treatments. The drug tamoxifen has helped many women, and a breast cancer vaccine is currently in development.

      "body": "<p><strong>BN:</strong> How, and why, did you get involved with Angela's Ashes in the first place?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> It was sent to me as a manuscript of a book before it was published, and I quite liked it and enquired about acquiring the rights but they'd gone to Scott Rudin - one of the producers - who buys every single book that's published in New York, so to get a book ahead of him is very difficult. It finally came back to me, and I was asked to do it by Scott and David Brown, the other producer. </p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> The book was a hugely successful and lots of people have read it and have their own image of what the film should be like. Is there a danger that those people going to see your film will be looking not for the film you've actually made but for the film you should have made? Were you conscious of that danger?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> I was, I think that's been the difficulty for film-makers throughout history really when you take a great literary work - and this is [a great work]. It's not just that it won the Pulitzer Prize, it's been a publishing phenomenon everywhere around the world. It had won the Pulitzer Prize by the time it came to me and it was a number one bestseller in the New York Times bestseller list. In Hollywood they always say, \"Well, that's okay, that's people who read but there's not many of those are there?\" .... To be honest this kind of film is the hardest to make, in that I needed to build sets but it's a very small story. It's based on someone's life, it's an Irish story and American studios are very reluctant to give to you money [for something], but because of the success of the book we were able to make the film. </p> <p>I loved it when it was sent to me in manuscript form, and you can be intimidated by it - all of you here who've probably read the book before you saw the film have a different film in your head, and I can never ever do it as good as that. </p> <p>My great mentor Fred Zinnemann did From Here to Eternity which had terrible, terrible reviews when it came out because it could never be as good as the book. But when it came down to it, his work was as important as the book because film is an organic process and maybe more people get to see the film, that's just by virtue of the different art forms. But you are nervous about anyone who has read the book - can I do justice to it? - I hope I have, and there are people who've read it and maybe thought I haven't.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> I would think that one of the great difficulties was that the book is told in the present tense by the young Frank at various ages. There was a script already in existence by Laura Jones, an Australian writer. Was it she who decided that instead of doing the young boy's voice going all the way through the film you should do it a little time afterwards, in retrospect, by the grown-up Frank, or was that your decision?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Scott Rudin and David Brown developed the script with Laura Jones and she was able to take what was a very difficult and complex book and pare it down to the very bare minimum. I thought she'd probably been too strict with paring it down, and I tried to flesh it out. One of things I did was to go back to the book because there's always so much more in the book than you could possibly put in a film. A film of the entire book would have been 5 - 8 hours long and that's a bit long really! [Laura Jones] did a really good job, it was a blueprint for what the film became.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> You cast Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, two non-Irish actors. Why did you choose those two?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Most directors have little lists in their heads of people they really want to work with. I had seen Emily in Breaking the Waves and I'd seen her in The Boxer - I hadn't seen her in Hilary and Jackie at that point - and I met her and she's an Arsenal supporter which was...</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> ...that's the worst thing you've said about Emily Watson! </p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> I know, but we are at the NFT so we have to give intellectual reasons for choosing actors. [Laughter] She grew up in Islington and is an Arsenal supporter so she got the job. [Laughter] Robert Carlyle, for some strange reason, supports a Scottish team. No, Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle were the first choices for the film.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> What about Irish actors though? You can't be too popular with the Irish acting fraternity?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Well, there are 350 cast and crew who made that film who are Irish and it's their film.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> But the main characters weren't [Irish].</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> I suppose so, but every other actor is Irish. If there was somebody else better there to do it I would have gone with it. The reason the film got made was because the American studios thought it was a good bet because it was a hugely successful book, simple as that, and they allocate X amount of money for me to make it. It wasn't necessary to have a movie star, it was my decision to go with the actors that I was comfortable with and so it's my fault. I chose them because I thought they were the best for it. I actually did think of all the Irish actors who were available to do it and decided on those two, and I can't blame anybody but me really.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> The more you look at the film the more you realise how difficult it was to make because your central character changes twice. That must have caused problems because the audience is involved in little Joe Breen [young Frank], then suddenly it's somebody else in his place. How did you overcome that?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> It's the hardest thing when you've got a young child growing up - when you read the book you can go day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year and you don't even notice it. On a film you have to be much more specific. But really the only way to do it is to break the whole film down into the classic three-act structure, and therefore I needed three boys. It's very difficult, I tried to make the transitions as smooth as possible. The problem is that there is the young Frank who is very sweet and loveable and in whom, as an audience, you invest so much, then suddenly you see the middle boy and the big worry was that the audience would then groan, \"Oh, I'm not going to see that little boy anymore, he's gone.\" </p> <p>Ciaran Owens - who plays the middle boy - is also very good and he has his amount of charm, and so Michael Legge - who plays the older Frank - has a very hard job because he's got to follow those [younger] boys who have so much natural charm, but there's no other way of doing it. I don't know how you can show such time difference really.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> I gather Joe Breen has been a huge hit in America. How old is he? 9?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> He was eight when he made the film. He's a farmer's son from Wexford before he came to the audition he had to milk the cows! He did the David Letterman show in New York and was a huge hit and he's been asked back. His parents have asked me if I could talk to him because you take a kid from nowhere and you are totally changing their lives and the reason he's so lovely is because he's unspoiled, and what we do is spoil him by putting him on American chat shows. For him to stay normal is very difficult, and it's very hard for him because I care more about him staying normal than him doing all the new chat shows. He's stayed pretty normal, mostly because he's got a really good Mum and Dad and because he's been brought up in a very nice way.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> Was Joe Breen overawed by David Letterman?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> No, Joe destroyed David Letterman! Letterman did not know how to deal with him because he totally and utterly told the truth. Apparently half-way through the questions Joe said to him, \"You bite your nails\". It takes a 9-year-old Irish kid to say that.</p> <p> <strong>BN:</strong> What about the making of the film, because it looks cold and wet. Was that deliberate, or was it wet and cold while you were making it?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Both, it was pretty cold and pretty wet, and in the book Frank talks about \"The damp, the damp, the damp\". It was a reason for a lot of the illnesses and the deaths of the children at the beginning of the film; there's not a page that goes by where it doesn't talk about the damp. But damp is quite a difficult thing to film because you feel it, you don't see it. Rain is also very difficult to film, particularly in Ireland because it's quite fine, so fine that the Irish don't even acknowledge that it exists. [Laughter] </p> <p>So if you have rain machines like we did you have to have heavy rain in order to photograph it, and it has to be back lit, even heavy rain. So you get into the mechanics of that to give an impression of damp because I can't do that in film - you have to see it and experience it but you can't feel it, not yet you can't.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> The cold comes across in the colour of the film, the colours are sharp but they are cold - you're under no illusion that this is a warm place in which this film has been made.</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Period recreation is very difficult unless you make a black and white movie, which in a way would have been easier to do but I wouldn't have made it in black and white even if we'd been allowed to, which we were not. What you do is narrow the colour palette and so the costume designer, the production designer and the cinematographer are all working in the same colour palette, which is to get rid of all those primary colours, and then the moment you put the rain in it automatically mutes the colours even more. You get back to that monochromatic which gives you a period feel, but is still real because it's still in colour.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> Those dreadful alleys were recreated?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> The main lane, Roden Lane - the centrepiece of the film - was a big set actually in Dublin, the interiors were at the studios but the big lane was built in the middle of Dublin in a bit of waste ground that we found.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> How did the people of Limerick react? From what I've heard half the people of Limerick say, \"Oh God, it was nothing like that at all\", and the other half claim to have lived next door to the family. Was there opposition or support for you when you went to film there?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> There are a lot of people in Limerick who have opinions about Frank McCourt's book, it's made Limerick very famous now. When you have that kind of publishing phenomenon which is about a place called Limerick then suddenly Limerick becomes very famous. In the contemporary sense Limerick isn't really, no one ever cares about Limerick in Ireland, it's called 'Stab City'. There are a lot of people in Limerick who feel that Frank exaggerated the poverty of his childhood, which he refutes. I made a film of his book, so I believe the things that he did. </p> <p>There were more people in Limerick who were sceptical than I would have hoped, particularly the Church. You'd think 50 years later they would be a bit more forgiving, but they really weren't. The main church where [Frank McCourt] went when he was a kid, called St Joseph's, certainly wouldn't let us in, they wouldn't even let us paint the railings outside. Five minutes from there is the Redemptonist church which figures in the masturbation scene. They - for very obvious reasons - wouldn't let us in [Laughter], and then there is the Franciscan church which figures at the end where the priest is one of the very few people who is kind to him. It's such a wonderful moment in the fact that this kid never lost his faith and I thought it was very beautifully explained in the film and in the book, and so you think that the Franciscans and that church would have been a bit kinder to us and would have allowed us to film in it. They did say yes, but a bit later on they said no. </p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Parker/Parker1.RA\">The difficulties of filming classic novels</a></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Parker/Parker2.RA\">How the people of Limerick reacted</a></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Parker/Parker3.RA\">The issue of poverty today</a></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Parker/Parker4.RA\">The British film industry</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Guardian readers a miserable bunch of whingers? Surely not; as Mark Twain reminds us: \"irreverence is the champion of liberty and it's only sure defence\". Anne Kenny Canterbury If there's nothing to whinge about, what's the point of writing to papers? Tony Black Sevenoaks The millennium party: a national disgrace? The London millennium party was a national disgrace. Far from being a festive spirit, the scenes were reminiscent of refugees evacuating a war-time European capital. Humphrey Hawksley London Hwhawksley@cs.com The real scandal was the lack of public loos. Reminiscences of the great night are dominated by tales of heroic bladder control as men and especially women sought in vain for a toilet... Is this further proof that without Ken running the show, London is incapable of organising a piss-up for the millennium ? Davy Jones London davyjones@cwcom.net Stop moaning! What a miserable bunch of whingers. Just how many lavs would you need to deal with 2m people? I am beginning to understand why the phrase 'Guardian reader' has taken on pejorative overtones. Brian Blain London Ever since whoever it was suggested a sample of gifts for the millennium child, the letters page has been full of smug scoffers, cynics and moaners. Yesterday out of 27 letters, 19 were moans and complaints more suited to the columns of the Telegraph. Has liberal guilt changed to liberal bile? Anne Hughes Seaford, E Sussex. AnneHughes2@compuserve. com The magazine I edit is well-known for the bilious whingeing and moaning that fills its letters pages each month. Our most recent readership survey found that 35% of ours were also Guardian readers, streets (nay, broad leafy boulevards) ahead of any other daily. Your letters page gives a clear indication that things aren't going to change very much this century, are they? Ian Anderson Editor, Folk Roots magazine froots@froots.demon.co.u k One of the oddest things those of us from overseas find about the British character is your attitude to any form of success or achievement. You stage the biggest millennium celebrations in the world, have the biggest and best party in the spectacularly unique Dome, and cover the event with 30 hours of superb television. And what is everyone talking about? A few queues of disgruntled people and a handful of fireworks that failed to ignite. You really should be so proud of your successes \u0085 I know that I was proud to be with you all on the big night. Robert Petric Zagreb, Croatia The real reason? I am amazed Guardian readers have failed to make the most obvious connection between the 19 whingers (Letters, January 3) and the gender imbalance of correspondents. All the whingers were men.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For those of us who have never reached such heights, the idea of stardom creates two great questions: what is the precise moment that you realised you were a star, and can you ever be the same again? Emily Watson thinks deeply about this, her forehead puckering up with concentration. \"In other people's perception I might be, but I'm not really. And anyway, it's a very abstract thing. It's not like getting a sofa for your front room.\" </p> <p>As an afterthought, she concedes that what first made her think she might be one was sitting on planes with Mike Leigh back in 1996. Watson had just made her debut in Breaking the Waves, Leigh had made Secrets and Lies, and they kept being booked on the same flights to the same awards ceremonies. \"It was like, hey, isn't this exciting, the Brits are coming. It was a fairytale year for a lot of people.\" </p> <p>Four years on, she has been hired - along with Robert Carlyle - to bring a bit of name recognition to a movie that is all about childhood. Alan Parker's film of Frank McCourt's bestselling memoir is a conflicted beast: in order to appeal to the American market that has kept Angela's Ashes in the bestseller lists for so long, it must have its adult stars. Yet the whole appeal of the book is its story of the child McCourt and his ability to save himself from the slough of despond inhabited by his alcoholic father and helpless mother. </p> <p>As the eponymous Angela (McCourt's mother), Watson gives birth to seven children and loses three of them to the ravages of poverty and disease, before losing her useless husband Malachy (a surprisingly unraddled-looking Carlyle) to the drinking life in England. </p> <p>For Watson, the film created several problems. First and foremost, how does a young, middle-class Londoner come to grips with the hardships of 1930s Limerick? \"It was really hard to get your head around. We have such a modern sensibility: if someone now had lost three children it would be in the newspapers for a start, and we have an army of bereavement counsellors, drugs and God knows what else to help us, whereas Angela had nothing. She just had to get on with bringing up the rest of her children as best she could.\" </p> <p>The imaginative problem is matched by a technical one: dramatically, Angela is a cipher. In the book, McCourt doesn't presume to understand her hopeless stoicism. In film terms, this means that she has no back story, no scenes of psychological revelation around which an actor can construct a three-dimensional movie character. </p> <p>There is one moment - Malachy has landed his first job and he and Angela canoodle for an instant in their front parlour - when Parker allows them to show a spark of the sexual attraction that must have held them together. But the rest of the film is characterised by Watson, head down, cigarette jutting from her mouth, tramping the mean streets from one charitable organisation to another in search of a crust to put in her children's mouths. </p> <p>\"The material is so powerful it's bewildering,\" Watson says. \"You get to the end of the day and Alan says, 'That was great work', but something's nagging in the back of your mind. Something awful happened. Then you think, 'Oh yeah, my baby died.' \"</p> <p>So how is it that the Islington-born, private-school educated daughter of an architect and a teacher has ended up playing such a no-hoper? Watson smiles. \"I'd always been told that in film and television you get cast as you are - so, as a middle-class English girl, I'd be in Jane Austen territory. I had no idea I'd be cast as a Scot or an Irishwoman.\" </p> <p>Yet it was as a Scot that she made her breakthrough, in Lars Von Trier's film of life at the edge of civilisation, Breaking the Waves. As the lonely islander besotted with a Danish rig-worker, Watson gave human shape to a particular sense of desolation. \"Lars didn't say anything as obvious as 'Look, you can do it'. He just saw something I didn't know was there. He opened a door and helped me through it. I absolutely credit him with finding that for me.\" </p> <p>What he found for her was a minor-key beauty, a soulfulness which has since won her a rush of roles, from the loyalty-torn girlfriend of Daniel Day-Lewis in The Boxer to the tormented cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in the biopic Hilary and Jackie. Watson describes that quality as a sort of fragility. </p> <p>\"I don't know where it comes from, because I feel very secure and happy in my life. I haven't had deeply traumatic experiences. I think it's due to psychological make-up. I've got one of those faces that shows things. It's not doing, but being. The funny thing is that I didn't know how bizarre my face looked until somebody put a camera on it. You really only know what you look like when you start to see yourself on film.\" </p> <p>One of the odd effects of her apparent fragility is that it comes as a surprise to see how tall she is - 5ft 8ins in bare feet - even though the evidence is there in the films. In The Boxer, she towers above her screen father, Brian Cox, and walks practically shoulder to shoulder with the stringy Day-Lewis. </p> <p>In retrospect, you could almost say that her height becomes an emblem of the characters she is playing. In Hilary and Jackie, she coils it around her cello; proclaims it from the podium with such force that her earlier, straight-backed confidence fuels the tragedy of the juddering, neurotic wreck that Du Pr\u00e9 eventually becomes. In a film that sets out to demolish the myth of heroic personality - and which pushes the actress to almost gothic extremes of manipulativeness - Watson somehow hangs on to a credible sense of tragic stature. </p> <p>We're back on the theme of where it all comes from. \"I don't know. What I do know is that I love that sense of coming away from a scene where you feel you've really found something - not something you've planned or rehearsed, but something about the character that comes to you on camera out of the blue. It's not work that translates directly on to the screen but it feeds in at a subtle, perceptual level.\" </p> <p>Can she think of any examples? \"In Star Wars, when Princess Leia says 'I love you' and Harrison Ford replies, 'I know'. In the script I think he said 'I love you too'. It may be apocryphal, but I love that story. It's such a brilliant moment, so typical of the arrogance of that character.\" </p> <p>Watson speaks quietly and thoughtfully, and it's not a surprise to learn that at school she was taught to meditate. It was also at school that she began to act. \"But I don't think I showed any more promise than anyone else. In terms of talent, I was probably a late developer.\" She went on to read English at Bristol university, and only then decided that she would blow her savings on a drama training. After being rejected by two drama schools, she finally found one that would take her. \"My parents never opposed me, though in private I think they were kind of circumspect.\" </p> <p>For years she followed the jobbing actor's star - in and out of work, up and down the country. It's easy to forget how suddenly success struck, and from what an unlikely quarter. \"I'd never heard of Lars Von Trier,\" she admits. \"I was telling people I was going up for this really strange little Danish movie. I didn't know me arse from me elbow.\" Realisation only kicked in months later, after the film's gala screening at the Cannes film festival, when 2,500 rose to their feet in a spontaneous standing ovation. Are her parents proud of her? \"Oh they're becoming more blas\u00e9, but they see the downside - they know I get lonely and they worry about me.\" </p> <p>More trickily, her husband, Jack Waters, is also an actor, whom she met during a spell of work for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Does he find her success difficult? \"I think there have been periods when it has been a bit weird for him, but we try to go through the experience of it together. He comes to Los Angeles with me, and he's very at ease with the whole round.\" </p> <p>The downside to success, she admits, is that \"things do change\". \"Meeting new people is strange. You can understand why people begin to revolve in film circles, because nobody's fazed by it. But, you know, my friends are still my friends. And there are certain advantages: when you start out as an actor you are just resigned to being penniless for the rest of your life. It goes with the territory. And suddenly I'm wealthy. I own my first home. I pinch myself about that.\" </p> <p>She insists that, though she has never doubted she would get by, nor has she ever had a masterplan. \"There are lots of things I want to do: I'd like to have children; I'd like to do more theatre; I've started writing some projects of my own and I'd like to finish them. And I'm looking forward to playing someone with a bit more life in them.\" </p> <p>One story she tells reveals a lot about the distance that this 32-year-old actress has travelled. \"I remember the moment my first film finished. I was devastated. It was such a big experience that I thought I'd never get over it. It's terribly sweet and innocent to be that devastated. But now I'm a little bit older and a little bit wiser I know that when the director says cut for the last time, it's cut. That's it. Something's gone.\" As she speaks, her face takes on something of Angela's impenetrable resignation.</p> <p>\u0095 Angela's Ashes is released on January 14. The Guardian Interview with Alan Parker is tonight at the NFT, South Bank (0171-928 3232), following a screening of Angela's Ashes at 6.30pm.</p>",

We're back on the theme of where it all comes from. \"I don't know. What I do know is that I love that sense of coming away from a scene where you feel you've really found something - not something you've planned or rehearsed, but something about the character that comes to you on camera out of the blue. It's not work that translates directly on to the screen but it feeds in at a subtle, perceptual level.\" Can she think of any examples? \"In Star Wars, when Princess Leia says 'I love you' and Harrison Ford replies, 'I know'. In the script I think he said 'I love you too'. It may be apocryphal, but I love that story. It's such a brilliant moment, so typical of the arrogance of that character.\" Watson speaks quietly and thoughtfully, and it's not a surprise to learn that at school she was taught to meditate. It was also at school that she began to act. \"But I don't think I showed any more promise than anyone else. In terms of talent, I was probably a late developer.\" She went on to read English at Bristol university, and only then decided that she would blow her savings on a drama training. After being rejected by two drama schools, she finally found one that would take her. \"My parents never opposed me, though in private I think they were kind of circumspect.\" For years she followed the jobbing actor's star - in and out of work, up and down the country. It's easy to forget how suddenly success struck, and from what an unlikely quarter. \"I'd never heard of Lars Von Trier,\" she admits. \"I was telling people I was going up for this really strange little Danish movie. I didn't know me arse from me elbow.\" Realisation only kicked in months later, after the film's gala screening at the Cannes film festival, when 2,500 rose to their feet in a spontaneous standing ovation. Are her parents proud of her? \"Oh they're becoming more blas\u00e9, but they see the downside - they know I get lonely and they worry about me.\" More trickily, her husband, Jack Waters, is also an actor, whom she met during a spell of work for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Does he find her success difficult? \"I think there have been periods when it has been a bit weird for him, but we try to go through the experience of it together. He comes to Los Angeles with me, and he's very at ease with the whole round.\" The downside to success, she admits, is that \"things do change\". \"Meeting new people is strange. You can understand why people begin to revolve in film circles, because nobody's fazed by it. But, you know, my friends are still my friends. And there are certain advantages: when you start out as an actor you are just resigned to being penniless for the rest of your life. It goes with the territory. And suddenly I'm wealthy. I own my first home. I pinch myself about that.\" She insists that, though she has never doubted she would get by, nor has she ever had a masterplan. \"There are lots of things I want to do: I'd like to have children; I'd like to do more theatre; I've started writing some projects of my own and I'd like to finish them. And I'm looking forward to playing someone with a bit more life in them.\" One story she tells reveals a lot about the distance that this 32-year-old actress has travelled. \"I remember the moment my first film finished. I was devastated. It was such a big experience that I thought I'd never get over it. It's terribly sweet and innocent to be that devastated. But now I'm a little bit older and a little bit wiser I know that when the director says cut for the last time, it's cut. That's it. Something's gone.\" As she speaks, her face takes on something of Angela's impenetrable resignation. \u0095 Angela's Ashes is released on January 14. The Guardian Interview with Alan Parker is tonight at the NFT, South Bank (0171-928 3232), following a screening of Angela's Ashes at 6.30pm.",

      "body": "<p><strong>RED IS THE COLOUR</strong></p> <p>It's the biggest scandal since Mrs Simpson told her husband she was off to England for a spot of tiffin. David Beckham got himself sent off for kicking Mexican midfielder Jose Milian in Brazil yesterday evening. Today he's been banned from playing in tomorrow's match with Vasco da Gama, fined 2000 Swiss francs (?!?), and the whole world's gone nuts about it. Well the Lord Justice Alex Ferguson has anyway.</p> <p>\"The reaction of the Mexican players got him sent off,\" Fergie fumed today, while chewing the head off a Martin Samuel replica action figure ('Watch him write! Watch him eat!'). \"The referee reacted to the Mexican players and that's disappointing.\" Ferguson failed to specify which Mexicans the ref reacted to however, the ones standing around complaining or the one flying halfway across the Amazon with his groin in tatters.</p> <p>Fortunately for Ferg, Ted Beckham's backing him to the hilt. David's grammatically-challenged dad (it's in the genes) insists his son shouldn't have been sent off because \"you see a lot worse challenges than last night's\". Mark Bosnich also got behind his angry teammate - which is surely the safest place to be. \"He didn't do anything,\" said the fascist-saluting stopper. \"All he did was motion to the guy to get up and it was pathetic all round.\" A comment which also extends to Bozzie's attempt at stopping Necaxa's goal last night.</p> <p>But according to Max Clifford, PR supremo, all United need to do to calm this particular storm is a good bit of, er, PR. \"What they should be doing is having a kickabout on the beach with kids, going to the local hospitals and taking loads of Manchester United posters and shirts. It's not about being cynical or manipulative,\" said the man who sold Mandy Allwood's octuplets to the News of the World, \"it's about doing things that decent people want to do. They get a lot out, so let them put something back.\" Like Jose Milian's goolies for a start.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SHIRT SHRIFT</strong></p> <p>Nike, the sportsman's friend, today told punters not to worry after traces of poison were found in its replica shirts. The international sportswear corporation, so beloved in Vietnam that the locals are willing to take less than a living wage for the privilege of hand-stitching Air Jordans, has had its Borussia Dortmund replica kit withdrawn from sale in German department stores because it was found to contain traces of TBT, a chemical which can disrupt the hormone system.</p> <p>Nike released a statement after fears spread that the British clubs for whom Nike produces shirts (if you can call Rangers and Arsenal British) could also be affected. According to \"initial research findings\" the chemical, found in paint that coats the hulls of ships, \"is not used in production of the garment\". \"Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans,\" the statement added smartish. \"Further tests are being carried out and we await the results of those.\"</p> <p>TBT neutralises the evil odours produced by sweat. It is also thought to raise production of testosterone and lower oestrogen levels, and has been suspected of causing malformation of sexual organs and sterility among sea snails.

      "bodyText": "RED IS THE COLOUR It's the biggest scandal since Mrs Simpson told her husband she was off to England for a spot of tiffin. David Beckham got himself sent off for kicking Mexican midfielder Jose Milian in Brazil yesterday evening. Today he's been banned from playing in tomorrow's match with Vasco da Gama, fined 2000 Swiss francs (?!?), and the whole world's gone nuts about it. Well the Lord Justice Alex Ferguson has anyway. \"The reaction of the Mexican players got him sent off,\" Fergie fumed today, while chewing the head off a Martin Samuel replica action figure ('Watch him write! Watch him eat!'). \"The referee reacted to the Mexican players and that's disappointing.\" Ferguson failed to specify which Mexicans the ref reacted to however, the ones standing around complaining or the one flying halfway across the Amazon with his groin in tatters. Fortunately for Ferg, Ted Beckham's backing him to the hilt. David's grammatically-challenged dad (it's in the genes) insists his son shouldn't have been sent off because \"you see a lot worse challenges than last night's\". Mark Bosnich also got behind his angry teammate - which is surely the safest place to be. \"He didn't do anything,\" said the fascist-saluting stopper. \"All he did was motion to the guy to get up and it was pathetic all round.\" A comment which also extends to Bozzie's attempt at stopping Necaxa's goal last night. But according to Max Clifford, PR supremo, all United need to do to calm this particular storm is a good bit of, er, PR. \"What they should be doing is having a kickabout on the beach with kids, going to the local hospitals and taking loads of Manchester United posters and shirts. It's not about being cynical or manipulative,\" said the man who sold Mandy Allwood's octuplets to the News of the World, \"it's about doing things that decent people want to do. They get a lot out, so let them put something back.\" Like Jose Milian's goolies for a start. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SHIRT SHRIFT Nike, the sportsman's friend, today told punters not to worry after traces of poison were found in its replica shirts. The international sportswear corporation, so beloved in Vietnam that the locals are willing to take less than a living wage for the privilege of hand-stitching Air Jordans, has had its Borussia Dortmund replica kit withdrawn from sale in German department stores because it was found to contain traces of TBT, a chemical which can disrupt the hormone system. Nike released a statement after fears spread that the British clubs for whom Nike produces shirts (if you can call Rangers and Arsenal British) could also be affected. According to \"initial research findings\" the chemical, found in paint that coats the hulls of ships, \"is not used in production of the garment\". \"Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans,\" the statement added smartish. \"Further tests are being carried out and we await the results of those.\" TBT neutralises the evil odours produced by sweat. It is also thought to raise production of testosterone and lower oestrogen levels, and has been suspected of causing malformation of sexual organs and sterility among sea snails. Any connoisseur of the replica shirt market will undoubtedly agree that Dortmund's shirts should have been withdrawn a long time ago. Since when does electric yellow go with anything? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'm delighted for the club because this is an award for all - the players and my backroom team.\" - Gerard Houllier after winning the manager of the month award for December. \"I would like to dedicate my award to Liverpool's fans.\" - Alright, thanks Gerard. \"We have had some very difficult times, uneasy periods, but they have always been right behind us with magnificent support.\" - Yes, thank you, we'd better be moving on. \"The award also reflects on the players - without their efforts managers do not get awards - and also on my backroom team.

      "body": "<p>Racial abuse aimed at black or foreign players at football grounds is still rife, according to university researchers who carried out a survey of 33,000 fans.</p> <p>Fans from Everton, Rangers and Celtic topped the league table for making the largest number of racist comments heard, the survey found.</p> <p>Arsenal, Charlton Athletic and Wimbledon won praise for reducing racism through campaigns inside their grounds, but according to Sean Perkins, of the Sir Norman Chester centre for football research at Leicester university, racism overall has remained much the same since the last survey, in the 1996-97 season.</p> <p>The research covered the four divisions of the English football league plus Rangers and Celtic, but only last year's Premier league teams and Scotland's two leading clubs were ranked in a \"league table of shame\".</p> <p>Fans were asked: \"Have you witnessed racism aimed at players this season (1998-99).\" The percentages of fans who heard racist abuse were: at Everton 38%, at Rangers 36%, at Celtic 33%, at West Ham 32% and at Newcastle by 31%. Best in the ranking were Wimbledon on 11%, Charlton on 12%, Derby on 14%, and Southampton and Arsenal on 16%.</p> <p>Everton fans became notorious in the 1980s for singling out the black footballer John Barnes, who played for Liverpool, during his first appearance in a Merseyside derby, when scores of bananas were thrown on to the pitch. The club was also one of the last in the country to have a black player in the team.</p> <p>Other clubs such as Chelsea, Leeds and Rangers became fertile grounds for organised rightwing groups in the 1980s and vociferously abused black players and fans, with the football authorities and police turning a blind eye.</p> <p>Dr Perkins said that although abuse overall did not appear to have diminished, it did seem to changing. More overt abuse, such as throwing bananas on to the pitch and groups chanting abuse, was rarer, and most examples were confined to individual bigots.</p> <p>The abuse was not confined to black players: foreign players were also verbally abused.</p> <p>\"The fact that racist abuse in all its forms is being reported so readily could be an encouraging sign that the high profile campaigns make people aware it is going on,\" he said.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, however, football has tackled racism. Many clubs have signed up to anti-racist initiatives and tried to attract non-white fans to their grounds. Figures continue to show that few black fans attend matches.</p> <p>The campaign is led by Kick It Out, which has enlisted the help of leading footballers to highlight racism, organises anti-racist days at the clubs, had Kick It Out banners erected at clubs, and is launching an anti-racist campaign at the end of this month with the support of the England manager, Kevin Keegan.</p> <p>The government has recently tightened legislation to stamp out racist chanting at grounds. Charlton Athletic said yesterday that leading clubs needed to do more to combat racism in and outside grounds.</p> <p>Yasin Patel, of Charlton Athletic for Race Equality, set up by the club and the local authority, said: \"It's good news for Charlton, but the survey shows that many clubs are merely paying lip service to the problem of racism.\"</p> <p>Dr Perkins said the fears of football fans had also changed. \"Before the Hillsborough disaster people were scared of being beaten up in grounds or crushed. Now it is more about lifestyle and sensibilities. Women and children, for example, who are now far more numerous in grounds, are offended by swearing, whereas men regard this as part and parcel of being a football fan.\"</p> <p>Another new factor, caused by all-seater stadiums, was that fans could no longer move away if a fan next to them was offensive, as they had been able to on the terraces.</p>",

Fans from Everton, Rangers and Celtic topped the league table for making the largest number of racist comments heard, the survey found. Arsenal, Charlton Athletic and Wimbledon won praise for reducing racism through campaigns inside their grounds, but according to Sean Perkins, of the Sir Norman Chester centre for football research at Leicester university, racism overall has remained much the same since the last survey, in the 1996-97 season. The research covered the four divisions of the English football league plus Rangers and Celtic, but only last year's Premier league teams and Scotland's two leading clubs were ranked in a \"league table of shame\". Fans were asked: \"Have you witnessed racism aimed at players this season (1998-99).\" The percentages of fans who heard racist abuse were: at Everton 38%, at Rangers 36%, at Celtic 33%, at West Ham 32% and at Newcastle by 31%. Best in the ranking were Wimbledon on 11%, Charlton on 12%, Derby on 14%, and Southampton and Arsenal on 16%. Everton fans became notorious in the 1980s for singling out the black footballer John Barnes, who played for Liverpool, during his first appearance in a Merseyside derby, when scores of bananas were thrown on to the pitch. The club was also one of the last in the country to have a black player in the team. Other clubs such as Chelsea, Leeds and Rangers became fertile grounds for organised rightwing groups in the 1980s and vociferously abused black players and fans, with the football authorities and police turning a blind eye. Dr Perkins said that although abuse overall did not appear to have diminished, it did seem to changing. More overt abuse, such as throwing bananas on to the pitch and groups chanting abuse, was rarer, and most examples were confined to individual bigots. The abuse was not confined to black players: foreign players were also verbally abused. \"The fact that racist abuse in all its forms is being reported so readily could be an encouraging sign that the high profile campaigns make people aware it is going on,\" he said. Since the 1980s, however, football has tackled racism. Many clubs have signed up to anti-racist initiatives and tried to attract non-white fans to their grounds. Figures continue to show that few black fans attend matches. The campaign is led by Kick It Out, which has enlisted the help of leading footballers to highlight racism, organises anti-racist days at the clubs, had Kick It Out banners erected at clubs, and is launching an anti-racist campaign at the end of this month with the support of the England manager, Kevin Keegan. The government has recently tightened legislation to stamp out racist chanting at grounds. Charlton Athletic said yesterday that leading clubs needed to do more to combat racism in and outside grounds. Yasin Patel, of Charlton Athletic for Race Equality, set up by the club and the local authority, said: \"It's good news for Charlton, but the survey shows that many clubs are merely paying lip service to the problem of racism.\" Dr Perkins said the fears of football fans had also changed. \"Before the Hillsborough disaster people were scared of being beaten up in grounds or crushed. Now it is more about lifestyle and sensibilities. Women and children, for example, who are now far more numerous in grounds, are offended by swearing, whereas men regard this as part and parcel of being a football fan.\" Another new factor, caused by all-seater stadiums, was that fans could no longer move away if a fan next to them was offensive, as they had been able to on the terraces.",

It was almost as if Putin was implying that these agencies were the keepers of the flame - organisations that placed the maintenance of Russian power and Russia's defence against its enemies above other considerations. Even given the novel nature of Russia's democracy, Putin's profile as agent-politician is a strange one, which he shares with Yevgeni Primakov, who most seem to think is the only man who could best him in the March elections.</p> <p>Primakov has much more of a proper public record than Putin, but after defections from his camp this week his chances in March are much diminished.

The success of the Unity party and other factions supporting Putin is what allowed Yeltsin to make his exit.

What exactly constitutes a classic these days? The term is used to describe everything from the Herm\u00e8s Kelly bag (launched in 1935) to the Fendi baguette (launched, um, a couple of years ago, but that's OK because it's an instant classic). It is used as a euphemism for not-very-fashionable; it is also, paradoxically, the height of fashion. Prada's enthusiastically received spring collection has the kind of smart shoes, pencil skirts and co-ordinating scarves beloved of bourgeois ladies that positively scream classic. </p> <p>Are these the safe option, then? Well, no. There is a very fine line between classic and dowdy. Nothing, for example, is as classic as a smart navy blazer, but in 1999, the year of the embroidered cardigan, nothing could have been less fashionable. Invest in a Burberry mac, on the other hand, and you will be the epitome of style this spring. </p> <p>Our concept of what is classic alters over time and even something very basic, such as a plain white shirt, has to metamorphose. British designer Margaret Howell, who has been making quietly quirky classics since 1976, includes a white shirt in every womenswear collection, but it's never the same shirt. She now has an archive of over 40 different designs. \"I love classic pieces,\" she says, \"but you have to alter them to keep them interesting.\" </p> <p>Plain cashmere sweaters are also cited as can't-go-wrong classics but these, too, have evolved. \"You do have to adjust them for shape and tiny details,\" says Doreen Keen, head of design for Scottish knitwear company Pringle. Only a few years ago, the classic Pringle sweater was a bloused affair that now looks frumpy; these days, it's fitted closer to the body and finer in texture, thanks to new yarns. </p> <p>What, then, should we be looking for when we trawl the sales? \"Something comfortable that fits into your wardrobe and you know you'll wear constantly,\" Keen says. Clued-up shoppers have always known where to get such pieces: cardigans from Agn\u00e8s b, slip dresses from Ghost, trousers from Joseph, scarves from Burberry, sweaters from John Smedley, coats (if you can afford them) from MaxMara. Increasingly, however, designers are making it simple for us to recognise these pieces, by branding them differently from their more trend-led, seasonal lines. There is Joseph Essentials, the look-no-further range based around his famously well-fitting trousers and simple Ts. Autumn/winter saw the debut of Emporio Armani Easy Pieces and 'S MaxMara, offering the kind of basic, sporty pieces - quilted nylon coats, machine-washable wool sweaters - the company no doubt hopes you can't live without. </p> <p>Marketed as \"essentials\", \"basics\" or \"staples\", these ranges will do everything you'd want a classic to do: they transcend the seasons and look smart and modern without being too high-fashion. They won't give you a top-to-toe look but are designed to be worn with more trendy or quirky pieces. \"It's something you can keep wearing,\" says Giorgio Giudotti, MaxMara's art director, about 'S MaxMara. \"These are very simple but luxurious pieces that have no season.\" Would he like to see a woman still wearing them in, say, five years' time? \"Maybe with a new pair of shoes or a new bag.\" </p> <p>While sniffier souls might find such ranges faintly patronising, there is certainly a demand for them. Pollyanna, the designer emporium that brought to Yorkshire the likes of Issey Miyake and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, has been producing its own range of basics, such as utterly simple Lycra dresses, for the past four years. \"It's one of our bestselling ranges,\" says Pollyanna's Rita Britton, who developed the line to fill a gap in her own wardrobe. \"There's hardly a thing that goes into the sale.\" </p> <p>For something to be defined as truly classic, of course, it has to prove its staying power. As Margaret Howell says: \"Some things come back and have an appeal in a new era. They are the real classics.\" </p> <p>But while we don't know whether Emporio Armani's Easy Pieces or 'S MaxMara's hooded jackets will still be with us in 20 years' time, maybe that doesn't matter. They're simple, modern and, as Giorgio Giudotti puts it, \"slick\": you can sling them on in the morning without worrying too much about how they look and they are simple enough to be worn for several seasons without becoming dated.

The embattled former health secretary's new offensive comes in the wake of a massive boost for Mr Livingstone's campaign after he secured 85.8% of the vote in a Transport and General Workers Union ballot - compared to Mr Dobson's 6.9%. He insisted he would do better in other union contests and said it was time for all the candidates to set aside issues about personalities and \"get down to brass tacks\". With his deputy, former journalist Trevor Phillips, Mr Dobson set out five key pledges which they said would improve Londoners' lives. \u0095 A named police officer would be assigned to every Londoner to help tackle crime; \u0095 A medical officer of health would be appointed for the city to reduce health inequalities; \u0095 Low-cost homes would be developed for key workers, such as nurses and teachers; \u0095 Free bus passes would be given to every young person under the age of 18; \u0095 And in order to improve education and leisure private sector partnerships would help ensure that four in five London households get internet access. Mr Dobson said: \"Ken [Livingstone] has nothing to say on these issues. \"He prefers to argue about process and doesn't want anyone to look closely at what he stands for.\" The MP for Holborn and St Pancras attacked Mr Livingstone's plans to revitalise London's creaking transport system, claiming his proposals for the tube would cost up to \u00a33 billion more than current plans. He also criticised Mr Livingstone's plans for a flat rate \u00a3100 tax on car owners in central London, saying it amounted to a \"poll tax on wheels\". \"In total, if Ken had his way, he would cost Londoners an extra \u00a318 billion - that is \u00a36,100 for every London household in his first term as mayor. \"The truth is that with Ken Livingstone you play now, but pay later.\" But Mr Dobson ran in trouble when he remarked he found it funny to watch \"toffee-nosed\" people queuing for the Millennium Dome. Expressing his amusement at the chaotic scenes of visitors clamouring to get into the Greenwich attraction during an interview about how he spent New Year's Eve, Mr Dobson told News Direct: \"It was a bit of a laugh really, some of those toffee-nosed people having to queue.\" Shadow minister for London Bernard Jenkin called for Mr Dobson to make \"an immediate apology\" for his \"crass comments\" which were \"a massive insult to ordinary people visiting the Dome.\" \"Many of those having to queue were not VIPs but had been invited because of their dedication to voluntary or charity work,\" Mr Jenkin said. \u0095 After his good result in the TGWU ballot, Ken Livingstone has been made 2/5 favourite by William Hill to win the race for Mayor of London.

      "body": "<p>For the loggers and rubber-tappers of the Javari Valley, the Korubo were a constant, hidden threat. Since records began, in 1928, at least 50 people had met their deaths - some by arrows, some clubbed, many with the flesh ripped from their bones - at the hands of the \"undiscovered\" Stone Age tribe. But the Brazilian settlers were not the only victims. If anything, they provoked the slaughter. In the same period, more than 150 Korubos were gunned down as \"civilised\" man plundered the rainforest for its natural riches.</p> <p>It was, essentially, a state of war between the new and the old inhabitants of the jungle, a violent struggle that has continued sporadically all over the Amazon basin since the first Europeans arrived in South America five centuries ago. Many tribes have been wiped out. The indigenous population has collapsed from between 3m and 5m to 300,000.</p> <p>The Korubo owe their survival to their awe-inspiring violence and their inaccessible home in the thick rainforest frontier between Brazil and Peru. And possibly to Sydney Possuelo. Whenever there are reports of lost or uncontacted tribes - often sparked by the discovery of the dismembered corpse of a pioneer - Possuelo gets a call. He is Brazil's most famous Indian tracker. But unlike the majority of the white men who have stalked tribes, he hunts them down to save them.</p> <p>Aged 59, Possuelo has spent four decades working in the Amazon to protect its indigenous people. He is one of the few remaining sertanistas, the swashbuckling Brazilian term for those who immerse themselves in the backlands' natural heritage. With his untamed black beard, piercing eyes and ripped khakis, he looks every inch the jungle explorer.</p> <p>In 1996, Possuelo decided to try to contact the Korubo. With a team that included Indians from nearby tribes, he made several expeditions, through the virgin rainforest, looking for the footprints and broken branches that would indicate the presence of human life. On the third trip he found a clearing and a hut of sticks and leaves. \"The tension was enormous. No one knew what was going to happen. All previous attempts at getting close had always resulted in death,\" says Possuelo. \"The big problem was that we didn't know how many of them there were. They could have circled us and killed us all.\"</p> <p>The Indians didn't appear. Possuelo left presents - knives, pans, an axe - and then left. First contact was only made on a following sortie, after his team had been camped by the Indians' clearing for a week.</p> <p>The Korubo were inevitably suspicious; their knowledge of the white settler was as a gun-toting aggressor. However, they seemed intrigued by the uncharacteristic behaviour of their visitors. Possuelo's group were leaving presents and singing Brazilian folk songs loudly, so as to \"announce their arrival with good intentions\".</p> <p>The Indians gradually appeared from behind the trees. First came a man, later identified as Shamabo, naked but for a piece of string tied round his waist to hold up his penis, covered in the red paint derived from urucu fruit, and holding a club. A second man arrived, then a woman. One Korubo took someone's hat and put it on. Another tugged at someone's necklace. Then they moved to the base camp, rifled through the food and took the packets of cheese crackers. Indians from the Matis tribe brought along by Possuelo managed to communicate; the languages turned out to be similar. The tribe was primitive, that was obvious. There were just 16 members left.</p> <p>In Possuelo's career at the National Indian Foundation (Funai) - the governmental branch responsible for Brazil's native population - Possuelo has tracked down seven new tribes, most recently the Korubo. Academics believe the Amazon holds the largest number of \"lost\" tribes of any equatorial area, sheltering more than 20.</p> <p>Possuelo runs Funai's Department for Isolated Indians, which he founded a decade ago. \"We started to collate information. There were 113 possible places,\" he says. Since then his team has proved the existence of \"lost tribes\" in 22 places and eliminated the possibility in 63 cases leaving 28 sites under investigation.</p> <p>These tribes live as they have for tens of thousands of years. They make fire by rubbing sticks together. They hunt with spear, arrow and blowpipe. They have no written language or system of counting beyond the first few digits. But something has happened to them in the past few centuries. According to Possuelo, each tribe has either seen or heard of confrontation due to the white invasion. They are all aware of an outside threat. We may not yet have discovered them, but they have discovered us.</p> <p>The first coherent Brazilian policy towards Indians emerged at the beginning of the century through the work of Candido Rondon, an army marshal who felt he should contact Indians for their own good. But the Indians died, and not just through murder, enslavement and poverty. \"What really killed them were the viruses we carry,\" says Possuelo. \"You could turn up one day and meet 200 Indians, and when you went back a week later only four were still alive.\"</p> <p>A pugnacious idealist, Possuelo has turned Indian policy on its head. His idea was to stop contact. Now, when a group of isolated Indians is located, they are left alone. Possuelo's job is to demarcate the land around them to stop anyone entering. He is both the only hope of finding out about the last tribes in the wild and the biggest obstacle to finding out more about them.</p> <p>The Korubo needed to be contacted for their survival. In the mid-90s, two whites were killed and there were reports of a massacre of 10 Indians. \"I think that if we didn't make contact, all the Indians would have died because of the settlers,\" says Possuelo. \"Now you see the Korubo playing by the banks of the river in peace.\"</p> <p>A hundred miles up a tributary of the Amazon from the triple frontier of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, where the river bobs with pink freshwater dolphins, a floating house marks the entrance to the Javari Valley. The valley is the size of Portugal and home to five contacted and about five isolated groups of Indians, including the Korubo. The house is also Possuelo's \"contact front\", the base he uses to protect the land from outsiders and to launch expeditions. It is has medical supplies and a 10-metre radio antenna (paid for by the European Union).</p> <p>From the house, it is an hour by motor boat to the village. The Korubo are waiting at the side of the river, smiling and shouting in high-pitched, syncopated sentences. The adults are no more than five feet tall, stocky, and with a crescent of hair shaved from the crown. We disembark and they lead us to a clearing where there is a large straw hut and planted corn.</p> <p>Possuelo, hyperactive and quick-tempered in his own environment, becomes a model of patience and calm. The Indians sit next to him, laughing with him. The chief, Shishu, puts his arm around him for about half an hour. Shishu makes us tea by grating a vine over a club encrusted with monkey-teeth, and then wetting and squeezing the result. A woman pulls down a stalk of maize, removes two corncobs, retires to the hut and emerges with them cooked. We are also offered the remains of a sloth. One man pulls up my shirt to see if I have breasts and looks down the trousers of Possuelo's long-haired teenage son. Several Indians show us lead shot embedded in their skin from the years of strife.</p> <p>The tribe appears happy and playful. They show no aggression. But some of the Indians are coughing, an indication that they are susceptible to germs visitors bring. Also, they are using the pans, axe and knives they were given, alien technology which undermines traditional means of cutting and cooking. I feel uneasy that our appearance, even in good faith, is somehow helping to destroy a fragile culture. How can they reconcile, for example, seeing themselves on my video camera, when the only time they have ever seen their own faces before is a dim reflection in the murky brown water of the Amazon?</p> <p>Using the Matis as interpreters, Possuelo's team has tried to discover some Korubo history. It appears that they were part of a larger group of as many as 100, but they splintered off a few years ago. \"There was an argument over a woman,\" says Possuelo.</p> <p>He is also a type threatened with extinction. He is fighting on all fronts - against the elements (he has had malaria 36 times), against the local white population (\"People here want to kill us. Before we got here they used the area like their own back yard. It was full of loggers, rubber tappers and hunters. Now all that has stopped.\") and against dwindling funds (he has a team of 16, poorly paid, spread out in an area the size of western Europe). Some of his \"contact fronts\" are unmanned, meaning that loggers are able to get to the indigenous areas unchecked.</p> <p>Possuelo is also in danger of being killed by the very people he is trying to protect. In 1997, the Korubo unexpectedly clubbed one of his colleagues to death. Last year a team of his men was besieged and terrorised deep in the jungle area of Acre by the tribe whose habits they were trying to research. \"Sydney has taken on one of the most difficult areas of work with Indians,\" says Orlando Villas-Boas, 86, Brazil's most famous sertanista . \"These Indians are in violent conflict with white man. They are very aggressive. Sydney has without question made great progress.\"</p> <p>Possuelo is working for what he believes is best for the isolated Indian population. But through contact, Indian priorities change. Often, they begin to want more contact with the white man. In one case, a whole tribe hailed a bus on a nearby road, and demanded to be taken to the nearest town. \"They might want to go to the towns, but what opportunities would they have there? When I say keep them isolated, I say this to win time. Time for us. Time doesn't change them. Time changes us. I hope our society will become a little bit more humane. If we continue to be imperialist, predatory then it is possible that in 30 years there won't be any isolated Indians left. I am not worried about morality. My work is about human rights. They have a right to be Indians. We should respect that.\"</p>",

But unlike the majority of the white men who have stalked tribes, he hunts them down to save them. Aged 59, Possuelo has spent four decades working in the Amazon to protect its indigenous people. He is one of the few remaining sertanistas, the swashbuckling Brazilian term for those who immerse themselves in the backlands' natural heritage. With his untamed black beard, piercing eyes and ripped khakis, he looks every inch the jungle explorer. In 1996, Possuelo decided to try to contact the Korubo. With a team that included Indians from nearby tribes, he made several expeditions, through the virgin rainforest, looking for the footprints and broken branches that would indicate the presence of human life. On the third trip he found a clearing and a hut of sticks and leaves. \"The tension was enormous. No one knew what was going to happen. All previous attempts at getting close had always resulted in death,\" says Possuelo. \"The big problem was that we didn't know how many of them there were. They could have circled us and killed us all.\" The Indians didn't appear. Possuelo left presents - knives, pans, an axe - and then left. First contact was only made on a following sortie, after his team had been camped by the Indians' clearing for a week. The Korubo were inevitably suspicious; their knowledge of the white settler was as a gun-toting aggressor. However, they seemed intrigued by the uncharacteristic behaviour of their visitors. Possuelo's group were leaving presents and singing Brazilian folk songs loudly, so as to \"announce their arrival with good intentions\". The Indians gradually appeared from behind the trees. First came a man, later identified as Shamabo, naked but for a piece of string tied round his waist to hold up his penis, covered in the red paint derived from urucu fruit, and holding a club. A second man arrived, then a woman. One Korubo took someone's hat and put it on. Another tugged at someone's necklace. Then they moved to the base camp, rifled through the food and took the packets of cheese crackers. Indians from the Matis tribe brought along by Possuelo managed to communicate; the languages turned out to be similar. The tribe was primitive, that was obvious. There were just 16 members left. In Possuelo's career at the National Indian Foundation (Funai) - the governmental branch responsible for Brazil's native population - Possuelo has tracked down seven new tribes, most recently the Korubo. Academics believe the Amazon holds the largest number of \"lost\" tribes of any equatorial area, sheltering more than 20. Possuelo runs Funai's Department for Isolated Indians, which he founded a decade ago. \"We started to collate information. There were 113 possible places,\" he says. Since then his team has proved the existence of \"lost tribes\" in 22 places and eliminated the possibility in 63 cases leaving 28 sites under investigation. These tribes live as they have for tens of thousands of years. They make fire by rubbing sticks together. They hunt with spear, arrow and blowpipe. They have no written language or system of counting beyond the first few digits. But something has happened to them in the past few centuries. According to Possuelo, each tribe has either seen or heard of confrontation due to the white invasion. They are all aware of an outside threat. We may not yet have discovered them, but they have discovered us. The first coherent Brazilian policy towards Indians emerged at the beginning of the century through the work of Candido Rondon, an army marshal who felt he should contact Indians for their own good. But the Indians died, and not just through murder, enslavement and poverty. \"What really killed them were the viruses we carry,\" says Possuelo. \"You could turn up one day and meet 200 Indians, and when you went back a week later only four were still alive.\" A pugnacious idealist, Possuelo has turned Indian policy on its head. His idea was to stop contact. Now, when a group of isolated Indians is located, they are left alone. Possuelo's job is to demarcate the land around them to stop anyone entering. He is both the only hope of finding out about the last tribes in the wild and the biggest obstacle to finding out more about them. The Korubo needed to be contacted for their survival. In the mid-90s, two whites were killed and there were reports of a massacre of 10 Indians. \"I think that if we didn't make contact, all the Indians would have died because of the settlers,\" says Possuelo. \"Now you see the Korubo playing by the banks of the river in peace.\" A hundred miles up a tributary of the Amazon from the triple frontier of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, where the river bobs with pink freshwater dolphins, a floating house marks the entrance to the Javari Valley. The valley is the size of Portugal and home to five contacted and about five isolated groups of Indians, including the Korubo. The house is also Possuelo's \"contact front\", the base he uses to protect the land from outsiders and to launch expeditions. It is has medical supplies and a 10-metre radio antenna (paid for by the European Union). From the house, it is an hour by motor boat to the village. The Korubo are waiting at the side of the river, smiling and shouting in high-pitched, syncopated sentences. The adults are no more than five feet tall, stocky, and with a crescent of hair shaved from the crown. We disembark and they lead us to a clearing where there is a large straw hut and planted corn. Possuelo, hyperactive and quick-tempered in his own environment, becomes a model of patience and calm. The Indians sit next to him, laughing with him. The chief, Shishu, puts his arm around him for about half an hour. Shishu makes us tea by grating a vine over a club encrusted with monkey-teeth, and then wetting and squeezing the result. A woman pulls down a stalk of maize, removes two corncobs, retires to the hut and emerges with them cooked. We are also offered the remains of a sloth. One man pulls up my shirt to see if I have breasts and looks down the trousers of Possuelo's long-haired teenage son. Several Indians show us lead shot embedded in their skin from the years of strife. The tribe appears happy and playful. They show no aggression. But some of the Indians are coughing, an indication that they are susceptible to germs visitors bring. Also, they are using the pans, axe and knives they were given, alien technology which undermines traditional means of cutting and cooking. I feel uneasy that our appearance, even in good faith, is somehow helping to destroy a fragile culture. How can they reconcile, for example, seeing themselves on my video camera, when the only time they have ever seen their own faces before is a dim reflection in the murky brown water of the Amazon? Using the Matis as interpreters, Possuelo's team has tried to discover some Korubo history. It appears that they were part of a larger group of as many as 100, but they splintered off a few years ago. \"There was an argument over a woman,\" says Possuelo. He is also a type threatened with extinction. He is fighting on all fronts - against the elements (he has had malaria 36 times), against the local white population (\"People here want to kill us. Before we got here they used the area like their own back yard. It was full of loggers, rubber tappers and hunters. Now all that has stopped.\") and against dwindling funds (he has a team of 16, poorly paid, spread out in an area the size of western Europe). Some of his \"contact fronts\" are unmanned, meaning that loggers are able to get to the indigenous areas unchecked. Possuelo is also in danger of being killed by the very people he is trying to protect. In 1997, the Korubo unexpectedly clubbed one of his colleagues to death. Last year a team of his men was besieged and terrorised deep in the jungle area of Acre by the tribe whose habits they were trying to research. \"Sydney has taken on one of the most difficult areas of work with Indians,\" says Orlando Villas-Boas, 86, Brazil's most famous sertanista . \"These Indians are in violent conflict with white man. They are very aggressive. Sydney has without question made great progress.\" Possuelo is working for what he believes is best for the isolated Indian population. But through contact, Indian priorities change. Often, they begin to want more contact with the white man. In one case, a whole tribe hailed a bus on a nearby road, and demanded to be taken to the nearest town. \"They might want to go to the towns, but what opportunities would they have there? When I say keep them isolated, I say this to win time. Time for us. Time doesn't change them. Time changes us. I hope our society will become a little bit more humane. If we continue to be imperialist, predatory then it is possible that in 30 years there won't be any isolated Indians left. I am not worried about morality. My work is about human rights. They have a right to be Indians. We should respect that.\"",

It's absolutely a problem of today, the thing is if you make a film that is relevant right now we find it hard to take, but when you set it in a period that's gone by people find that a little more acceptable. I remember that when I did Mississippi Burning that opened up a controversy, and suddenly I wasn't answering questions relevant to Mississippi Burning and the black civil rights movement in the 60s, I was talking about racism in the US now.

We're very small fry compared to the cinema of the US.

This government is [helping] and we're grateful for that, however film is a sexy business, it's an easy political thing, that's why they like us. Every time the Oscars come around we'll have one or two successes that will be lauded - it becomes a matter of national pride to do that. World cinema is totally and utterly dominated by American cinema, and for us to make inroads into it is very, very difficult, but we are able to do that more than any other country and we're doing that. We're strong because we're strong creatively, we're fiscally weak - that's why we need government support, but I'm optimistic, every day there's another director, another writer, another actor who comes along.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> We're not so strong on the writing line are we? We make too many films which go into production before the script is right, either because the money will be withdrawn unless they start production now, or because we haven't got the screenwriters. We don't respect screenwriters as much as the Americans do, do we? We're still into playwrights and novelists much more than screenwriters.</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> It's very interesting - in America they're starting to respect them far too much. Next year the possessive credit is going to be the biggest single, solitary battleground in that American film directors will possibly go on strike yet again to retain the possessive credit. Writers totally and utterly disagree with it in the US. But although we're a literary nation we're very poor at screenwriting. It's the weakest area with regards to infrastructure: our scripts are bad. And a lot of it is to do with philosophy in so much as we have very strong theatre, and if someone writes for the theatre they can succeed because of the auteur theory - which has also rubbed off on people who write screenplays in this country, which is that it's not allowed to be interfered with when it's actually at its most formative time. There's not a screenplay ever written in history that wasn't actually made better than its first draft, but with so many films here somebody writes something and they get it made. And no one's allowed to comment on it, and that's a lot of the reason why a lot of bad films have been made in this country.</p> <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Do you need any special skills to work with young actors?

For [Angela's Ashes] we went all over Ireland looking for the kids, and all you can do is to create an environment where they can be at their best. If it's an unpleasant atmosphere they won't perform, so you end up sometimes being very strict with them but most of the time I think I was a friend to them. Joe [Breen] did a press conference where they said to him, \"What was it like working with Alan Parker?\" and he said, \"Oh it was fine, he doesn't mean to lose his temper.\" So however kind I think I am, I'm probably not sometimes.</p> <p><strong>BN:</strong> Rumour has it that 15,000 kids were looked at for the film.

      "body": "<p>The ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, last heard from on December 3, 1999 as it started a descent to the surface of the Red Planet, may be lying crippled in a huge crater, the chief mission scientist said on Thursday. </p> <p>But Richard Zurek, the Mars Polar Lander Project Scientist, said the crater theory was just one of several scenarios being considered by scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He said the three-legged craft was heading in the direction of the crater when it hit the Martian atmosphere. </p> <p>\"There is a large crater in the western portion of the landing zone which contains rougher terrain than what we've seen elsewhere,\" Zurek told reporters. </p> <p>He described the crater, close to the Martian south pole, as being about two thirds of a mile deep and covering an area the equivalent of California's vast Central Valley, which measures several thousand square miles. </p> <p>The sides of the crater slope at 20 degrees, which would send the lander tumbling to the bottom of the crater. It was designed to land on slopes no greater than 10 degrees. </p> <p>Zurek said that after flight controllers at Martin Lockheed in Golden, Colorado, had performed a fourth flight correction manoeuvre a few days before the lander reached Mars, scientists realised they were drifting west and toward the huge crater. </p> <p>\"We had planned a fifth and final correction for a few hours before the landing to push the lander more to the east, but we realised that manoeuvre would also push us too far to the south, so we chose to control the... landing path. We expected we would have landed a bit north of the crater,\" he said. </p> <p>But he said there were so many variables that the final resting place of the $165 million lander might never be known, unless the Mars Global Surveyor satellite, which has been mapping the Red Planet since 1997 and is photographing the landing site, can find its long white parachute - the largest single object with the tiny craft. </p> <p>One of those variables is the Martian wind, which can howl through the atmosphere at nearly 70 mph, kicking up huge dust storms. Zurek said that if the winds were coming from the east they could possibly have blown the craft over to the crater. </p> <p>Zurek said the Global Surveyor, which started looking for the lander two weeks ago, will continue its search for another two weeks. The best hope is the satellite will be able to take pictures of the craft's 65-foot long parachute draped across the surface, because the tiny lander is too small for the satellite's cameras to pick up. </p> <p>\"If we find the parachute we will know that the lander is no more two thirds of a mile away because if everything went right the two would have separated one kilometre above the surface and there wouldn't be much distance between them when they came down,\" he said. </p> <p>Zurek said the investigation into what happened is far from over and the crater theory is just one possibility. </p> <p>\"We have not ruled out anything. We have not yet found any piece of information that tells us it's the landing site, the flight system, the radar system - a whole host of things could have caused us to lose the lander,\" he said. </p> <p>And he described a story in Thursday's Denver Post in which unnamed engineers at Lockheed Martin were quoted as saying the crater was probably the most likely theory as \"premature.\" </p> <p>Zurek also disputed the claim that Lockheed Martin was not told of the crater until two weeks after the lander disappeared. </p> <p>\"No one on our side knew that canyon was there. All of a sudden, two weeks later, we got this... data\" - essentially Martian topographical maps and images - \"and it was like, 'Look at that hole!' Everybody was fairly surprised to see that data,\" the unnamed source told the Denver Post. </p> <p>Zurek said, \"Data was showing the canyon when we picked the landing site. This was exposed to the team at Lockheed Martin.\" </p> <p>Dr. Noel Hinners, Vice President of Astronautics Flight Systems at Lockheed Martin, said that while the crater landing was one scenario, \"We have no knowledge, zip, zero, of what went wrong. We don't know anything for sure. The door is still wide open. The (Denver Post) article is totally false.\" </p> <p>He agreed that finding the craft's parachute was paramount in the investigation. \"If we see the parachute it tells us we had good separation from the cruise stage, we really know where we landed. The hunt for parachute is very important,\" he said. </p> <p>The failure of the Mars lander was Nasa's second major loss at the Red Planet in three months. In September 1999 the Mars Climate Observer satellite was lost due to human error as it approached the planet, bringing the total loss to $265 million.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, last heard from on December 3, 1999 as it started a descent to the surface of the Red Planet, may be lying crippled in a huge crater, the chief mission scientist said on Thursday. But Richard Zurek, the Mars Polar Lander Project Scientist, said the crater theory was just one of several scenarios being considered by scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He said the three-legged craft was heading in the direction of the crater when it hit the Martian atmosphere. \"There is a large crater in the western portion of the landing zone which contains rougher terrain than what we've seen elsewhere,\" Zurek told reporters. He described the crater, close to the Martian south pole, as being about two thirds of a mile deep and covering an area the equivalent of California's vast Central Valley, which measures several thousand square miles. The sides of the crater slope at 20 degrees, which would send the lander tumbling to the bottom of the crater. It was designed to land on slopes no greater than 10 degrees. Zurek said that after flight controllers at Martin Lockheed in Golden, Colorado, had performed a fourth flight correction manoeuvre a few days before the lander reached Mars, scientists realised they were drifting west and toward the huge crater. \"We had planned a fifth and final correction for a few hours before the landing to push the lander more to the east, but we realised that manoeuvre would also push us too far to the south, so we chose to control the... landing path. We expected we would have landed a bit north of the crater,\" he said. But he said there were so many variables that the final resting place of the $165 million lander might never be known, unless the Mars Global Surveyor satellite, which has been mapping the Red Planet since 1997 and is photographing the landing site, can find its long white parachute - the largest single object with the tiny craft. One of those variables is the Martian wind, which can howl through the atmosphere at nearly 70 mph, kicking up huge dust storms. Zurek said that if the winds were coming from the east they could possibly have blown the craft over to the crater. Zurek said the Global Surveyor, which started looking for the lander two weeks ago, will continue its search for another two weeks. The best hope is the satellite will be able to take pictures of the craft's 65-foot long parachute draped across the surface, because the tiny lander is too small for the satellite's cameras to pick up. \"If we find the parachute we will know that the lander is no more two thirds of a mile away because if everything went right the two would have separated one kilometre above the surface and there wouldn't be much distance between them when they came down,\" he said. Zurek said the investigation into what happened is far from over and the crater theory is just one possibility. \"We have not ruled out anything. We have not yet found any piece of information that tells us it's the landing site, the flight system, the radar system - a whole host of things could have caused us to lose the lander,\" he said. And he described a story in Thursday's Denver Post in which unnamed engineers at Lockheed Martin were quoted as saying the crater was probably the most likely theory as \"premature.\" Zurek also disputed the claim that Lockheed Martin was not told of the crater until two weeks after the lander disappeared. \"No one on our side knew that canyon was there. All of a sudden, two weeks later, we got this... data\" - essentially Martian topographical maps and images - \"and it was like, 'Look at that hole!' Everybody was fairly surprised to see that data,\" the unnamed source told the Denver Post. Zurek said, \"Data was showing the canyon when we picked the landing site. This was exposed to the team at Lockheed Martin.\" Dr. Noel Hinners, Vice President of Astronautics Flight Systems at Lockheed Martin, said that while the crater landing was one scenario, \"We have no knowledge, zip, zero, of what went wrong. We don't know anything for sure. The door is still wide open. The (Denver Post) article is totally false.\" He agreed that finding the craft's parachute was paramount in the investigation. \"If we see the parachute it tells us we had good separation from the cruise stage, we really know where we landed. The hunt for parachute is very important,\" he said. The failure of the Mars lander was Nasa's second major loss at the Red Planet in three months. In September 1999 the Mars Climate Observer satellite was lost due to human error as it approached the planet, bringing the total loss to $265 million.",

He has been charged with genocide by the prosecutor general's office in Lithuania, but there is little likelihood he will ever be deported, let alone stand trial.</p> <p>Gudelis was a lieutenant in Lithuania's Third Auxilliary Police Batallion during the second world war. The force, controlled by the Nazis, was instrumental in the persecution of Jews in the Kovno ghetto, and was responsible for the slaughter of 9,200 men, women and children on a single day in October, 1941: the worst mass murder in Lithuanian history.</p> <p>Gudelis was investigated by the Australian war crimes tribunal but he was not brought to trial. However, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre uncovered additional evidence which, three years ago, led to him being charged by the Lithuanians over the deaths of more than 10,000 Jews. The extra evidence was presented to the Australian authorities but seems to have been ignored. Gudelis's son, Edward, said recently that the Australian police investigated his father seven years ago and \"did not find damaging evidence\". Gudelis has denied any involvement in war atrocities.</p> <p><b> Aleksandras Leleikis</b> <br> Aleksandras Leleikis, 92, is another Lithuanian who has evaded prosecution, even though he was stripped of US citizenship, forced to return to Vilnius, and charged with genocide.

Suspicions that he was involved in war crimes were confirmed in 1990 when Lithuania declared its independence and opened its state archives.</p> <p>The special investigations office of the US justice department has alleged Leleikis was district security chief of the Lithuanian police in Vilnius. The force, which was subordinate to the Gestapo, was responsible for the murder of 50,000 Jews between June 1941 and July 1944. Mike Macqueen, from the OSI, discovered documents for the arrest, detention and transfer for execution of hundreds of Jews signed by Leleikis.</p> <p>In hearings to strip him of his American citizenship, Leleikis said he was only carrying out orders. In June 1996, he boarded a plane to Vilnius and two years later was charged over the deaths of 74 Jews by the Lithuanian authorities. The trial was halted because of his alleged poor health. America and Israel believe he is faking. \"This is the latest episode in the tragic story of the Lithuanian government's consistent failure to achieve justice in cases of Nazi crimes against humanity,\" said Eli Rosenbaum, head of the OSI.</p> <p><b> Alois Brunner</b><br> The arrest and conviction of Alois Brunner remains the top priority of war investigators. He was private secretary to Adolph Eichmann, who oversaw Hitler's \"final solution\". Brunner has been blamed for the murder of 128,500 Jews from Austria, Greece, France, Romania and Hungary. Several countries have issued arrest warrants for him and there is evidence he is currently living in Syria under the name Georg Fisher, though this has never been properly verified.</p> <p>He joined the Austrian Nazi Party in 1931, aged 19, and the SS in 1932, where he was promoted because of his rabid anti-semitism. He was responsible for deporting 44,000 Jews in sealed wagons from Salonika, Greece, to concentration camps in six weeks. As head of the Drancy concentration camp, near Paris, he sent more than 23,500 Jews to their deaths. Claiming Jewish children were \"future terrorists\", he ordered 250 children onto a cattle wagon bound for Auschwitz in July 1944. More than 200 were murdered, mostly by gas, some from medical experimentation. Camp survivors referred to him as \"the dark nightmare\" and a \"mad sadist\". At the end of the war, he escaped from Europe with false papers and helped set up Syria's intelligence services.</p> <p><b> Abu Nidal</b> <br> Abu Nidal, which means \"father of the struggle\", has been one of the world's most wanted terrorists for the past 20 years. He is wanted by Italy, the US and the UK for attacks which have killed 250 people. Nidal, a Palestinian whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is currently thought to be living in Libya.</p> <p>In 1973, he formed the Fatah Revolutionary Council, described by the US as the \"world's most dangerous terrorist group\". At the time, Nidal was ambassador for the PLO in Sudan and Iraq, but he defected because he did not agree with Yasser Arafat's conciliatory attitude. Nidal was responsible for the attacks on Rome and Vienna airports in 1985, which killed 17, and the 1986 synagogue bombing in Istanbul, in which 21 people perished. He was also behind the attempted assassination in London 18 years ago of Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador. In 1987, he shot 150 of his own agents to ward off traitors within his 800-strong organisation.</p> <p><b> Osama Bin Laden</b> <br> Osama Bin Laden is currently the FBI's most wanted man. It has offered a $5m reward for information leading to his capture. Investigators believe he is in Afghanistan, protected by 300 bodyguards, and do not believe he will ever be brought to justice. Bin Laden, also known as \"the prince\" and \"the director\", is head of the terrorist organisation, Al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the bombings of the US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, in August 1998. More than 200 people were killed in the blasts.</p> <p>Bin Laden is the mastermind of most Islamic terrorism, and has an estimated fortune of $200m. He is thought to have been responsible for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York, and attacks on US soldiers in his native Saudi Arabia.</p> <p><b> Eric Robert Rudolph</b> <br> Also on the FBI top 10 list, Rudolph was charged two years ago with bombing the Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The blast killed one woman and injured hundreds of others. He is also thought to have bombed two abortion clinics and a lesbian nightclub in 1997 and 1998.</p> <p>The FBI first heard about him the day after the explosion at the clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 30, 1998. A witness noticed the registration number of his pick-up truck and when officers searched his house they found bomb-making material.</p> <p>Rudolph, 34, has been on the run ever since. An army veteran and specialist in survival techniques, he is thought to be hiding somewhere in the Great Smoky Mountains Range, which divides North Carolina and Tennessee. The FBI has offered $1m for information leading to his arrest.</p> <p><b> Antonio Angeles Martins</b> <br> One of Interpol's most wanted men, the poster with his name and details describes him as \"dangerous, violent, infectious and addicted to drugs\". Born in Brazil, Martins, 34, has been charged in Spain with the kidnap, rape, torture and murder of three teenage girls in November 1992. The girls, who came from a village near Valencia, were hitchhiking to a disco when Martins and an accomplice abducted them. Their bodies were found 65 days later, buried in shrubland near Tous. Post mortems confirmed the girls had been shot and subjected to horrific torture. Martins, who has Spanish citizenship, has been on the run ever since. There have been unconfirmed sightings of him in Lisbon and Brazil.</p> <p><b> Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix</b> <br> Leader of the notorious Mexican drug syndicate, the Tijuana Cartel. The FBI believes the 34-year-old, a former policeman, is one of the world's biggest cocaine smugglers. Thomas Constantine, former head of the US drug enforcement administration, said the Tijuana Cartel, and its rival the Juarez Cartel, are more powerful than the Mexican government. He described Arellano-Felix as one of the new breed of \"narco-juniors\" who are better educated, more sophisticated and more entrepreneurial than their predecessors. He is on the FBI's current top 10 wanted list.</p> <p><b> Radovan Karadzic</b> <br> Wanted for genocide by the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs has been specifically charged with responsibility for killing up to 6,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in July 1995 \"in order to kill, terrorise and demoralize the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat population\". He was also charged over the shelling of Sarajevo, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in May and June 1995. Karadzic, a poet and one-time petty criminal, lives under armed guard just outside Pale.</p> <p><b> Slobodan Milosevic</b> <br> The Yugoslav president has also been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal \"for crimes against humanity and violations of the customs of war\" - that is rapes, killings, forced deportations and illegal detentions.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br><a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/\">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.holocaust-history.org/\">The holocaust history project</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/hpg.htm\">The Home Office: Immigration information</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw branded Konrad Kalejs a war criminal yesterday as the alleged death squad lieutenant left Britain and dashed hopes that he would be prosecuted here. Kalejs, 86, made a pre-dawn escape from the Leicestershire residential home where he had been staying. He left Britain voluntarily after the home secretary issued a notice that he intended to deport him. Kalejs was accompanied to Heathrow by police and immigration officials. Just after 10.30am he left British soil en route to Australia aboard a Singapore airlines jet. It is believed he will be greeted by protests in Melbourne today, which will renew pressure on the Australian government to prosecute him. Latvia stressed last night that it was investigating him. Nazi-hunters wanted Kalejs, an Australian citizen, charged in Britain for involvement in the murder of 30,000 people, mainly Jews, while joint second in command of a Latvian mobile killing squad, the Arajs Kommando, that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers of Latvia during the second world war. In London, the home secretary intensified his offensive against critics of Britain's decision that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Kalejs which let him leave the country as a free man. The US and Canada had both considered the evidence of Kalejs's involvement in war crimes strong enough to deport him. Mr Straw admitted that \"with hindsight\" Kalejs should have been on the suspects' index, which would have led to him being denied entry into Britain. His name has now been added to the list of 500,000 to be refused entry. The home secretary also hinted that even if there had been strong evidence, the war crimes act may not have covered Kalejs. He said Scotland Yard \"considered it legally questionable whether Kalejs could be regarded as resident in the United Kingdom as would be required if he were to be tried under the war crimes act 1991\". He stressed that his decision that Kalejs should be deported required a lower standard of proof than a criminal prosecution: \"My decision that reasonable grounds existed to believe that Kalejs was complicit in war crimes was, of course, reached where necessary on the balance of probabilities.\" Mr Straw said nothing more could have been done, but sidestepped questions about the rigour of the police investigation into Kalejs, who was never questioned by officers about any of the war crimes allegations against him. Kalejs entered Britain at Birmingham airport on September 27 1997, from Frankfurt and as an Australian national had permission to stay for six months. He had a passport which had been renewed in February 1999 which did not contain stamps which could have alerted immigration officers to the fact that he had been deported from the US in 1994 and Canada in 1997. Britain's refusal to prosecute Kalejs was condemned by one of his alleged victims Alfred Winter, 81, who lives in the US. Mr Winter told the Guardian he was guarded by Kalejs's unit at the Salaspils camp where he was held from December 1941 to July 1942 and saw executions, beatings and death from starvation: \"It's a very bad feeling that he has escaped justice again.\" Lord Janner, who campaigns for war criminals to be brought to justice, said: \"I am deeply disappointed, frustrated and sad that this evil man was allowed to leave Britain before he was sent to jail for the rest of his days. It is now up to the Australian authorities. We are going to try to get them to investigate fully.\" Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe expressed dismay that Kalejs had departed without facing criminal action in the UK. In Australia, ministers have also promised to reinvestigate Kalejs if new evidence comes to light, having dropped a prosecution for lack of evidence. The Latvian government said yesterday that criminal proceedings had been started against Kalejs in that country and called for international help gathering information which might provide evidence against him.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the start of his memoir, A Sort of Life, Graham Greene makes pointed mention of the cinema in the high street of his childhood Berkhamsted. With its voluptuous Moorish dome, the picture palace was forbidden territory to Greene and his schoolboy friends. The author's father, at that time headmaster of Berkhamsted School, was chary of the place in any case. He had once \"allowed his senior boys to go there for a special performance of the first Tarzan movie, under the false impression that it was an educational film of anthropological interest\". </p> <p>Greene relates how, ever after, his father \"regarded the cinema with a sense of disillusion and suspicion\". Those two words, carefully chosen, are a perfect description of the landscape that has, for better or worse, become known as \"Greeneland\". Greene himself, who hated the term, reluctantly described it as: \"White men going to seed in outlandish places. Unshaven, guilt-ridden, on the bottle.\" </p> <p>You can understand an author's reaction to critical shorthand, but there is more to Greeneland than Greene's terse definition. Even a book like The End of the Affair - set in upper-middle-class London and newly brought to the screen by Neil Jordan - is well within its ambit.</p> <p>Sometimes noirish (The Third Man), sometimes tropical (The Comedians), sometimes criminal (Brighton Rock), nearly always, even if at a submerged level, religious - insofar as it involves a journey through personal crisis - Greeneland is a mixed vernacular. It is one that has informed cinematic as well as literary narrative. Directors of the quality of John Ford, Fritz Lang and Carol Reed are among those who have turned their attentions to the books of an author whose work has been translated to film more than that of any other 20th-century writer. </p> <p>Disillusion and suspicion also describe, however, Greene's own feelings about the film industry at the end of his 50-year association with it as optioned novelist, adapter of his own works and those of others (Evelyn Waugh tried to persuade him to do Brideshead Revisited), original screen-writer and prolific film critic. </p> <p>Although Greene was always at pains to emphasise that it was money that drew him to films, it wasn't just a journeyman attachment; it went right to the heart of his own aesthetic matter. As David Parkinson puts it in the introduction to his invaluable Graham Greene film reader, Mornings in the Dark, \"Greene's fictional style was undeniably filmic.\"</p> <p>By the time of his death, his oeuvre had given rise to some 40 feature films, not to mention numerous short films for television, a host of unmade projects, and his own evanescent scenario work for Korda, the GPO film unit and others. Some of the films of his books are unmitigated disasters; others - notably The Third Man, originally written as a screen treatment - are acknowledged classics of cinema. </p> <p>Yet in general, with only a few exceptions, Greene believed that \"my books don't make good films\". One of those exceptions was the 1955 adaptation of The End of the Affair, his 1951 novel about a love-triangle in the Blitz. From multiple perspectives, entangling religious and sexual themes, the book tells the tale of a egoistic writer's affair with the wife of a pitiful civil servant. Jordan's new film of the novel - which was based very loosely on one of Greene's own affairs - has Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea playing writer, wife and civil servant respectively. </p> <p>Starring Deborah Kerr and directed by Edward Dmytryk, the original was adapted by one Lenore Coffee. In a 1984 Guardian Film Lecture, Greene described it as the \"least unsatisfactory\" of the adaptations of his religious novels, his particular b\u00eate noir being The Heart of the Matter, in which the suicide of Catholic policeman Scobie was obscured for reasons of populism, censorship and fear of offending Catholic sensibility. </p> <p>In The End of the Affair, the religious theme hangs on a sort of inverted Pascal's Wager. After making love to the writer, Bendrix, the adultress (an outmoded term now, but potent as hemlock in the 1940s time frame) Sarah witnesses what she believes to be his death when a bomb falls nearby. A devout, if straying Catholic, she prays with all her heart that if God brings Bendrix back to life, she will give him up forever. When he wakes up - or is he woken up? - she breaks off the affair, without saying why. </p> <p>The subtle unfolding of the story, two years later, follows Bendrix's slow grasping of what has taken place and, briefly and tragically, the lovers' reunion. One of the strengths of this very powerful, not to say harrowing, tale is that its mystical drama never loses sight of the everyday. This is true even of the final \"miracle\", involving the disappearance of a facial blemish touched by Sarah. </p> <p>The atheist Bendrix's own story concerns the acceptance or otherwise of faith, as provoked by these events. In Jordan's version, Bendrix is made the main focus, with the stealing of Sarah's journal giving access to her point of view. Like the novel, Jordan uses a deal of flashback - something that was dropped by Columbia in the earlier film (they also distribute the new one), much to Greene's disappointment. </p> <p>Despite bridling at lack of control, he definitively did not want to do the original adaptation himself. But he did show up on the set. In August 1954, the Daily Sketch had Greene, \"that sad-faced chronicler of sex and sin\", turning up at Shepperton. He told the reporter that \"scripting your own stories can be unwelcome and fatiguing\". It appears to have been a gruelling visit anyway. Thirty years later, in his Guardian interview with Quentin Falk, he related with some distaste how the actor playing Bendrix (Van Johnson) put his stored chewing gum back in his mouth whenever he was off-camera. </p> <p>Who is to say whether Jordan's adaptation would have met with the approval of a writer who was the first to admit his own failings, with those of others following a very close second? What we can say is that, keeping agnosticism and the miraculous in the balance, it will find a ready audience thirsting for religious guidance. </p> <p>It will also find an audience hungry for the erotic. For Greene, who became a regular at Oxford film theatres in pre-talkie days, the ritual of cinema-going always had something of the illicit about it: \"There is the secrecy of sneaking into a cinema in the dark, perhaps with a girlfriend: no one need know.\"</p> <p>As master chronicler of the Absconded God's flight from his sinful creatures, Greene also saw how religious ecstasy could no longer make magnificent declaration of its sensual qualities: far from being public art, like Bernini's statue of St Theresa, 20th-century sensual religious experience would, in his hands, be a secret, half-lit thing. The preserve of a cinema-goer. An adulterer. A novelist in his garret. </p> <p>Or all of the last three: a knowing scene in Jordan's film shows the lovers in a picture-house watching an adaptation of one of Bendrix's novels. \"I didn't write it that way,\" he says, in a moment heavy with an ironical sense that the divine author's scenario for the outcome of the affair might not accord with his present plans either. Greene himself was more direct, talking of the flaky adaptations of books (and, just as often, the acting or camera technique) as if they were outright mortal sins, things to be ashamed of, even - especially - when he was directly involved. </p> <p>It was almost as if traffic with the film industry itself had a sinful dimension. And the industry seemed to sense this conflict. Guy Elmes, who adapted two of Greene's novels, said that it was \"the theology that gives the tone that attracts people to buy the stuff to film in the first place... then they actually have to script it and it becomes rather frightening and a concern whether mass audiences will be able to take this internal agony thing he's trying to externalise all the time.\" </p> <p>At first, though - at the start of Greene's affair with cinema - it was love. In Mornings in the Dark, Parkinson reveals the pitch of the young novelist's excitement about the medium. In 1936, with one novel adapted and the rights to another sold, he wrote to his brother: \"I'm getting deep into films, so deep that Grierson sounded me the other day on whether I should be interested in a producing job...\" By the end of the year, he is \"thick in scenario, Medium Shots and Insert Shots and Flash Backs and the rest of the racket\". </p> <p>It was a bit of an exaggeration. With neither film nor book money coming in quickly enough, he was already back in journalism. Ten years earlier, Greene had taken a job as a sub-editor on the court pages of the Times. Later came (anonymous) film reviews for that paper's entertainment section. His first novel, The Man Within, was published in 1929, while he was still on the Times. Five more came, with limited success, between then and 1935, when he rather casually took up the job which would see him become a regular face at preview screenings. </p> <p>By then a book reviewer for the Spectator, he suggested - at a drinks party, after that \"dangerous third martini\" - that he become their film critic. They accepted, and one of the most incisive writers on film (Philip French: \"the most ferocious I've ever come across\") was launched. </p> <p>That was June 1935. Within just three years, his reputation went far and wide, with one aggrieved film-maker sending him a piece of shit enclosed in a letter. By 1938, he was also contributing to Night and Day magazine, and found himself accused of writing, in a review of Wee Willie Winkie, that 20th-Century Fox had procured Shirley Temple for immoral purposes. The nine-year-old Miss Temple (\"infancy is her disguise, her appeal is more secret and adult\") won her case, and Greene had to pay \u00a3500 of the \u00a33,500 costs. </p> <p>Other stars fared little better, but Greene wasn't into bitchiness alone. He also tried to put across an idea of the cinema that would return it to the true populism of the Elizabethan stage, to vibrancy in place of gentility. </p> <p>But in spite of renown, those \"four and a half years of watching films several times a week\", those \"mornings in the dark\", were really a means of escape from novel writing - \"escape from the hellish problems of construction in Chapter Six, from the secondary character who obstinately refuses to come alive, escape for an hour and a half from the melancholy which falls inexorably round the novelist when he has lived for too many months on end in his own private world\". </p> <p>With the coming of the second world war, Greene's reviewing activity began to tail off. It was partly the welcome excitement of the war, but he seems to have felt tarnished, as if he were a patent examiner who'd seen too many inventions that failed. </p> <p>Post war, for Greene as novelist and screenwriter supplying the film industry, there was still much invention to come, but the appeal of this would tire too: \"I've made films in the forties, fifties and sixties. But the time comes when one's enthusiasm begins to slacken. One's left with only enough enthusiasm for one's own work, which is writing novels...\" </p> <p>Film, however, was also at the centre of that \"own work\", in Greene's consolidation of the use of cinematic style in fiction: the \"new habit of narrative\" as Evelyn Waugh called it in a review of The Heart of the Matter. Greene himself, in words that no contemporary novelist can afford to ignore, put it like this: </p> <p>\"When I describe a scene, I capture it with the moving eye of the cine-camera rather than the photographer's eye - which leaves it frozen. In this precise domain I think the cinema has influenced me. Authors like Walter Scott or the Victorians were influenced by paintings and constructed their backgrounds as though they were static and came from the hands of a Constable. I work with a camera, following my characters and their movements.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The End of the Affair will be released on February 4. The Guardian Interview with Neil Jordan, Ralph Fiennes and Stephen Woolley will take place on February 1 at the NFT.

Who is to say whether Jordan's adaptation would have met with the approval of a writer who was the first to admit his own failings, with those of others following a very close second? What we can say is that, keeping agnosticism and the miraculous in the balance, it will find a ready audience thirsting for religious guidance. It will also find an audience hungry for the erotic. For Greene, who became a regular at Oxford film theatres in pre-talkie days, the ritual of cinema-going always had something of the illicit about it: \"There is the secrecy of sneaking into a cinema in the dark, perhaps with a girlfriend: no one need know.\" As master chronicler of the Absconded God's flight from his sinful creatures, Greene also saw how religious ecstasy could no longer make magnificent declaration of its sensual qualities: far from being public art, like Bernini's statue of St Theresa, 20th-century sensual religious experience would, in his hands, be a secret, half-lit thing. The preserve of a cinema-goer. An adulterer. A novelist in his garret. Or all of the last three: a knowing scene in Jordan's film shows the lovers in a picture-house watching an adaptation of one of Bendrix's novels. \"I didn't write it that way,\" he says, in a moment heavy with an ironical sense that the divine author's scenario for the outcome of the affair might not accord with his present plans either. Greene himself was more direct, talking of the flaky adaptations of books (and, just as often, the acting or camera technique) as if they were outright mortal sins, things to be ashamed of, even - especially - when he was directly involved. It was almost as if traffic with the film industry itself had a sinful dimension. And the industry seemed to sense this conflict. Guy Elmes, who adapted two of Greene's novels, said that it was \"the theology that gives the tone that attracts people to buy the stuff to film in the first place... then they actually have to script it and it becomes rather frightening and a concern whether mass audiences will be able to take this internal agony thing he's trying to externalise all the time.\" At first, though - at the start of Greene's affair with cinema - it was love. In Mornings in the Dark, Parkinson reveals the pitch of the young novelist's excitement about the medium. In 1936, with one novel adapted and the rights to another sold, he wrote to his brother: \"I'm getting deep into films, so deep that Grierson sounded me the other day on whether I should be interested in a producing job...\" By the end of the year, he is \"thick in scenario, Medium Shots and Insert Shots and Flash Backs and the rest of the racket\". It was a bit of an exaggeration. With neither film nor book money coming in quickly enough, he was already back in journalism. Ten years earlier, Greene had taken a job as a sub-editor on the court pages of the Times. Later came (anonymous) film reviews for that paper's entertainment section. His first novel, The Man Within, was published in 1929, while he was still on the Times. Five more came, with limited success, between then and 1935, when he rather casually took up the job which would see him become a regular face at preview screenings. By then a book reviewer for the Spectator, he suggested - at a drinks party, after that \"dangerous third martini\" - that he become their film critic. They accepted, and one of the most incisive writers on film (Philip French: \"the most ferocious I've ever come across\") was launched. That was June 1935. Within just three years, his reputation went far and wide, with one aggrieved film-maker sending him a piece of shit enclosed in a letter. By 1938, he was also contributing to Night and Day magazine, and found himself accused of writing, in a review of Wee Willie Winkie, that 20th-Century Fox had procured Shirley Temple for immoral purposes. The nine-year-old Miss Temple (\"infancy is her disguise, her appeal is more secret and adult\") won her case, and Greene had to pay \u00a3500 of the \u00a33,500 costs. Other stars fared little better, but Greene wasn't into bitchiness alone. He also tried to put across an idea of the cinema that would return it to the true populism of the Elizabethan stage, to vibrancy in place of gentility. But in spite of renown, those \"four and a half years of watching films several times a week\", those \"mornings in the dark\", were really a means of escape from novel writing - \"escape from the hellish problems of construction in Chapter Six, from the secondary character who obstinately refuses to come alive, escape for an hour and a half from the melancholy which falls inexorably round the novelist when he has lived for too many months on end in his own private world\". With the coming of the second world war, Greene's reviewing activity began to tail off. It was partly the welcome excitement of the war, but he seems to have felt tarnished, as if he were a patent examiner who'd seen too many inventions that failed. Post war, for Greene as novelist and screenwriter supplying the film industry, there was still much invention to come, but the appeal of this would tire too: \"I've made films in the forties, fifties and sixties. But the time comes when one's enthusiasm begins to slacken. One's left with only enough enthusiasm for one's own work, which is writing novels...\" Film, however, was also at the centre of that \"own work\", in Greene's consolidation of the use of cinematic style in fiction: the \"new habit of narrative\" as Evelyn Waugh called it in a review of The Heart of the Matter. Greene himself, in words that no contemporary novelist can afford to ignore, put it like this: \"When I describe a scene, I capture it with the moving eye of the cine-camera rather than the photographer's eye - which leaves it frozen. In this precise domain I think the cinema has influenced me. Authors like Walter Scott or the Victorians were influenced by paintings and constructed their backgrounds as though they were static and came from the hands of a Constable. I work with a camera, following my characters and their movements.\" \u0095 The End of the Affair will be released on February 4. The Guardian Interview with Neil Jordan, Ralph Fiennes and Stephen Woolley will take place on February 1 at the NFT. Giles Foden's novels, The Last King of Scotland and Ladysmith, are in development as films. Greene on Hollywood women Mae West: \"Big-busted carnivorous creature in tight white sequins.\" Shirley Temple: \"An oddly precocious body as voluptuous in grey flannel trousers as Miss Dietrich's.\" Jean Harlow: \"Her technique was the gangster's technique - she toted breast like a man totes a gun.\" Irene Dunne (singing to a horse): \"The one without the white patch on her forehead.\" Greta Garbo: \"The finest filly of them all.\"",

Sir Alex took over and I had two seasons with him. I learned determination and desire from him.\" Dion Dublin will be out for the rest of this season with his broken neck, a setback for Aston Villa after it was thought he would be absent only until March. \u0095 Borussia Dortmund shirts, made by Nike, have been removed from German shops after traces of the highly toxic chemical tributyltin, which can disrupt the hormone system, were discovered in them.

      "body": "<p>Amid all the thousands of millennial hit lists which currently lie ready for recycling from the world's dustbins, the category of Most Influential Music Book of the 20th Century seems somehow to have been overlooked. Maybe the omission is not all that surprising, since there can be very little argument that Solomon Volkov's 1979 book Testimony would have been the runaway winner of the contest.</p> <p>The writer Allen Ho calls Testimony \"probably the most controversial book in the history of music.\" Few would disagree, even if they would then go on to disagree about almost everything else that the book contains. More than 20 years after its first publication, Testimony - or, to give it its more nuanced full title, Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich as related to and edited by Solomon Volkov - remains an astonishingly divisive book. And the imminent publication of a new study of Shostakovich by one of Volkov's principal critics seems certain to deepen the festering divisions still further. </p> <p>The protagonists for and against Testimony are as intransigent and irreconcilable today as they were way back in 1979. In learned and sometimes not-so-learned articles, in increasingly long and heavy books, and on some of the hottest non-pornographic websites on the internet, the armies continue to fight a sleepless conflict for the soul of the great Russian composer. The venom with which the two sides routinely abuse one another has to be read to be believed.</p> <p>The cold war may be 10 years dead in the political world, but it thrives undiminished in the argument over Shostakovich. Terms such as Stalinist, McCarthyite, revisionist and anti-revisionist fly regularly back and forth between the battle-lines. Charges of bias, incompetence, fraud, and intellectual dishonesty make up the everyday stuff of the unending hostilities. Even a brief exposure to the Shostakovich controversy makes one yearn for the peace, civility and aesthetic refinement of the Wagner-and-the-Jews debate. </p> <p>When he died in August 1975, Shostakovich was recognised, though somewhat grudgingly in some western circles, as a hugely talented composer of uneven output, including 15 symphonies and as many string quartets. But he was still widely seen as the Soviet Union's man. Though he had been out of official favour at various times - notably during Stalin's \"anti-formalist\" clampdowns in the 1930s and again in the late 1940s - the presence in his 147-strong list of works of such compositions as Glory to Our Soviet Homeland, to say nothing of symphonies commemorating the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, tended to cast him in many eyes as an irreversibly implicated artist. </p> <p>The publication of Volkov's book in the west - to this day it has never been published in Russia - turned that view on its head. Based on a series of conversations with the composer, Testimony depicted an altogether different Shostakovich. This Shostakovich was a troubled, angry, mordant, deeply ambivalent inner rebel against the Soviet system.</p> <p>On the best of all possible authorities - the composer himself - Testimony asserted that several of Shostakovich's best-known works - including such major pieces as the fifth and 10th symphonies - were little more than works of sarcastic private dissidence against the Soviet system. Volkov's account triggered an enormous response among the general music public and among professional specialists, to say nothing of substantial book sales. It also set off two related arguments which, 20 years on, are still raging almost unchecked. </p> <p>The first concerned the authenticity of the document published by Volkov under Shostakovich's name. Was it, in short, genuine? The second focused on the truthfulness of the Volkov/Shostakovich account. Was the book, in other words, a reliable source about the composer's life and music?</p> <p>Two years ago, the musicologists Dmitry Feofanev and Allan Ho mounted the most extended defence yet - their supporters would say the most comprehensive vindication - of Volkov. The centrepiece of their book, Shostakovich Reconsidered, was a 300-page rebuttal of the repeated charges that Volkov's book is not genuine. The critics, says Ho, \"have no facts with which to respond to our book\". The pianist/conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, who wrote an introduction to Shostakovich Reconsidered, said last year that Volkov was \"an absolutely genuine presentation of Shostakovich's mind\". </p> <p>This year it is the turn of Volkov's critics to produce a heavyweight response. The latest episode in music's very own Twenty Years War is the publication of Laurel Fay's book, Shostakovich: A Life, which came out in the United States last year and is published later this month by Oxford University Press (\u00a325). Fay's book has been coolly reviewed in the New York Times, mauled in the Washington Post, and monumentally attacked by the British writer Ian MacDonald, in an online denunciation on his Shostakovichiana website. Try though they may to move on, the two sides remain locked in battle just as they have been for decades. </p> <p>No one has done more to challenge the cases for Volkov than Fay. As early as 1980, when she was a relatively unknown recent graduate student, Fay charged in a review article that Volkov had lifted large parts of his supposedly interview-based volume from already published articles by Shostakovich. Ever since then, Volkov's defenders - though only rarely Volkov himself - have fought to exonerate the book from Fay's charges and, even more significantly, from the implication that Testimony was in some important sense an unbelievable account, perhaps published more for political than musicological reasons. </p> <p>In her book, Fay claims to stand above the argument over whether Testimony is genuine. \"Even were its claim to authenticity not in doubt,\" she writes, \"Testimony would still furnish a poor source for the serious biographer.\" Yet when I met her in New York last month, Fay told me that she is far from done with the issue. \"I am going to revisit the authenticity issue again in print next year,\" she said. \"Was it a document with which Shostakovich willingly collaborated and which he wanted published? I don't think it was.\"</p> <p>Her riposte to Ho and Feofanov will be published in St Petersburg, in Russian, in a volume on Shostakovich edited by Lyudmila Kovnatskaya. \"Testimony is identical in every respect, word for word, even down to the punctuation, with those parts which Shostakovich published during his lifetime,\" Fay continues to assert. \"The basic point is the same now as it was in 1980. We haven't been given adequate evidence that this is authentic. I can counter all the arguments in Shostakovich Reconsidered.\" </p> <p>One of the mysteries in the whole argument is Volkov's continuing reluctance to defend his book against the remaining critics. When he appeared at a New York conference last February, Volkov said it was his \"first and very probably last\" public statement about Testimony, which he insisted was \"an absolutely honest book\".</p> <p>Attacking Fay as \"out to get me\", he claimed that he had not even read her 1980 review. \"I don't have a view of Volkov as a person,\" Fay told me last month. \"I am a scholar and I am interested in posterity. I know Volkov had conversations with Shostakovich. I think there are parts of the book that reflect those conversations. But a lot of it is the musical gossip that was current at the time. Testimony does reflect the kinds of stories and anecdotes that were floating around the musical community in Russia. In the end, though, people must check what was correct and what was incorrect.\" </p> <p>In truth, the argument about Volkov's book was never exclusively about authenticity. Even without reading between the lines of much of the written material on Shostakovich, it has long been clear that the argument is still just as much about the wider reliability of Volkov's account. \"Writing about Shostakovich remains laced with political and moral subtexts,\" says Fay in the introduction to her biography. \"At its most extreme, it simply replaces one orthodoxy with another, reversing the polarities of the old, shopworn Soviet cliches; the true-believing communist citizen-composer is inverted into an equally unconvincing caricature of a lifelong closet dissident.\"</p> <p>Fay was more forthright in her criticisms when we talked. \"They want to read his music as encoded dissidence,\" she charges. \"I don't. They start from the position of knowing the answers. I start from the position of asking the questions. I don't automatically assume that his 'Soviet' music is ironic. I allow that he might have been serious. The basic thing is that he was a great composer.\" </p> <p>Shostakovich's life and work, Fay insists, is \"not a black-and-white subject\". While many former Soviet musicians, including Ashkenazy, have endorsed the Volkov portrait, she acknowledges, others in a position to know have not done so. The soprano Galina Vizhnevskaya, for example, said that the Shostakovich in the book was not the Shostakovich she knew. Even Maxim Shostakovich, the composer's son, remains equivocal. </p> <p>Equivocation, though, remains a luxury in this intensely charged argument. During our conversation, I asked Fay why on earth she and her fellow sceptics never seem to have met any of their accusers. Her embattled reply epitomises a continuing cold war-era gulf. \"I don't have any reason not to,\" said Fay, \"but not while they're defaming me, not while they're throwing mud at me. I'm not going to be told I'm a liar and unethical just because I think they are wrong. These people aren't really interested in Shostakovich at all.\"</p>",

Even without reading between the lines of much of the written material on Shostakovich, it has long been clear that the argument is still just as much about the wider reliability of Volkov's account. \"Writing about Shostakovich remains laced with political and moral subtexts,\" says Fay in the introduction to her biography. \"At its most extreme, it simply replaces one orthodoxy with another, reversing the polarities of the old, shopworn Soviet cliches; the true-believing communist citizen-composer is inverted into an equally unconvincing caricature of a lifelong closet dissident.\" Fay was more forthright in her criticisms when we talked. \"They want to read his music as encoded dissidence,\" she charges. \"I don't. They start from the position of knowing the answers. I start from the position of asking the questions. I don't automatically assume that his 'Soviet' music is ironic. I allow that he might have been serious. The basic thing is that he was a great composer.\" Shostakovich's life and work, Fay insists, is \"not a black-and-white subject\". While many former Soviet musicians, including Ashkenazy, have endorsed the Volkov portrait, she acknowledges, others in a position to know have not done so. The soprano Galina Vizhnevskaya, for example, said that the Shostakovich in the book was not the Shostakovich she knew. Even Maxim Shostakovich, the composer's son, remains equivocal. Equivocation, though, remains a luxury in this intensely charged argument. During our conversation, I asked Fay why on earth she and her fellow sceptics never seem to have met any of their accusers. Her embattled reply epitomises a continuing cold war-era gulf. \"I don't have any reason not to,\" said Fay, \"but not while they're defaming me, not while they're throwing mud at me. I'm not going to be told I'm a liar and unethical just because I think they are wrong. These people aren't really interested in Shostakovich at all.\"",

It's set in the 17th century, with a budget of more than \u00a310m; and was directed by cinematographer Philippe Rousselot.

It sounds like Ken Loach and hits you with the same worn-out end-of-the-tether raging realism, but the unemployment black spot here is in northern France and the director is Bertrand Tavernier, another expert on social realism.</p> <p>The genesis of the film came from discussions with Tavernier's new son-in-law, a primary school head; the script shares the credit between the director and the younger couple, and provides the film with immediacy and anger shared with the fictional head teacher, played by Philippe Torreton, a Tavernier regular keeping it in the family.</p> <p>The film hurtles along, throwing insoluble problems at its teachers and leaving the viewer almost as breathless as its protagonists. Like Loach, it has unfussy documentary-style direction and a mixture of professional and non-professional acting. But there's nothing amateurish about it and for all its hardships and the characters' failures, it doesn't share Loach's sense of helplessness.</p> <p>There's a sense of joy at the achievements too, and the children involved look as if they were having a whale of a time. If there's a criticism, giving the teacher in a mining area of high unemployment an ex-miner father with bad lungs and a girlfriend with a delinquent son may have been overegging the pudding a bit dramatically. But the film, which won two prizes at the Berlin film festival, should be of wider interest than teachers and social workers and it looks fine in widescreen. Artificial Eye's clear subtitling is a bonus too in a talky film that crackles with exasperation and determination to improve things.</p> <p><strong>Darkness Falls</strong><br>Rental <br>Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 <br> *</p> <p>In a busy year for Ray Winstone, this was the role that got away in a film that crept briefly and hesitantly into the cinema and feels more like straight-to-video fare. Winstone appears uninvited in a swish pad inhabited by Sherilyn Fenn, once in Twin Peaks as TV's most improbable schoolgirl since Please Sir and here playing the bored wife of a dodgy financier with a \u00a310m debt (Tim Dutton).</p> <p>Adapted from NJ Crisp's play Dangerous Obsession, Gerry Lively's film struggles to avoid staginess. An interesting premise soon becomes a ponderous exposition in which you tend to guess the plot twists in advance (though not the ludicrous ending). Winstone looks ill at ease here: he's given shocking facial hair and isn't allowed to wear a West Ham shirt even once. Surprisingly, he opts to play a menacing character very quietly when a bit more threat might have livened things up.</p> <p><strong>Vendetta</strong><br>Rental <br>Mosaic Movies, Cert 15 <br> **</p> <p>Very decent drama from HBO based on a shocking true story. It's set in turn-of-the-century New Orleans where workers fleeing famine in Sicily run fruit and vegetable stalls on the waterfront. When the local police chief gets murdered, they provide convenient suspects and the word Mafia (pronounced Mar-Feea in this locality) is bandied about for the first time in the deep south.</p> <p>As a result, the video box labels Vendetta a \"Mafia thriller\" but the film is a thoughtful piece about prejudice, corruption and racism. There's a clumsily tacked-on romance but as a courtroom drama, it does a good job. The resultant travesty of justice was apparently condoned by Theodore Roosevelt, history's great proponent of fair trade. Christopher Walken, the cast's only star name, appears in a supporting role as a behind-the-scenes fixer. Nick Pileggi, co-writer of GoodFellas, is credited as an executive producer, and the director is Nicholas Meyer.</p>",

The genesis of the film came from discussions with Tavernier's new son-in-law, a primary school head; the script shares the credit between the director and the younger couple, and provides the film with immediacy and anger shared with the fictional head teacher, played by Philippe Torreton, a Tavernier regular keeping it in the family. The film hurtles along, throwing insoluble problems at its teachers and leaving the viewer almost as breathless as its protagonists. Like Loach, it has unfussy documentary-style direction and a mixture of professional and non-professional acting. But there's nothing amateurish about it and for all its hardships and the characters' failures, it doesn't share Loach's sense of helplessness. There's a sense of joy at the achievements too, and the children involved look as if they were having a whale of a time. If there's a criticism, giving the teacher in a mining area of high unemployment an ex-miner father with bad lungs and a girlfriend with a delinquent son may have been overegging the pudding a bit dramatically. But the film, which won two prizes at the Berlin film festival, should be of wider interest than teachers and social workers and it looks fine in widescreen. Artificial Eye's clear subtitling is a bonus too in a talky film that crackles with exasperation and determination to improve things. Darkness Falls Rental Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 * In a busy year for Ray Winstone, this was the role that got away in a film that crept briefly and hesitantly into the cinema and feels more like straight-to-video fare. Winstone appears uninvited in a swish pad inhabited by Sherilyn Fenn, once in Twin Peaks as TV's most improbable schoolgirl since Please Sir and here playing the bored wife of a dodgy financier with a \u00a310m debt (Tim Dutton). Adapted from NJ Crisp's play Dangerous Obsession, Gerry Lively's film struggles to avoid staginess. An interesting premise soon becomes a ponderous exposition in which you tend to guess the plot twists in advance (though not the ludicrous ending). Winstone looks ill at ease here: he's given shocking facial hair and isn't allowed to wear a West Ham shirt even once. Surprisingly, he opts to play a menacing character very quietly when a bit more threat might have livened things up. Vendetta Rental Mosaic Movies, Cert 15 ** Very decent drama from HBO based on a shocking true story. It's set in turn-of-the-century New Orleans where workers fleeing famine in Sicily run fruit and vegetable stalls on the waterfront. When the local police chief gets murdered, they provide convenient suspects and the word Mafia (pronounced Mar-Feea in this locality) is bandied about for the first time in the deep south. As a result, the video box labels Vendetta a \"Mafia thriller\" but the film is a thoughtful piece about prejudice, corruption and racism. There's a clumsily tacked-on romance but as a courtroom drama, it does a good job. The resultant travesty of justice was apparently condoned by Theodore Roosevelt, history's great proponent of fair trade. Christopher Walken, the cast's only star name, appears in a supporting role as a behind-the-scenes fixer. Nick Pileggi, co-writer of GoodFellas, is credited as an executive producer, and the director is Nicholas Meyer.",

Once Marty himself rode in the back of Travis Bickle's cab, brooding creepily about firing his Magnum into a woman's \"pussy\". In this picture, Scorsese is just the chirpy radio voice of the dispatcher, chivvying the ambulance drivers like an exasperated parent. What an almost Blairite revolution. </p> <p>The picture is set in the early 90s, the latest period in which a steamy, sleazy New York could plausibly be featured to retain some contemporary punch, and Nicolas Cage as Frank gives his usual drawn portrayal of equine dismay at every horrible little thing the city has to offer. His suffering, slack-jawed face is habitually radiant with sweat and sprinkled with blood. Driven pretty well barking mad through lack of sleep, he is haunted by the memory of Maria, an asthmatic street girl who he failed to rescue, and now seeks redemption - ever a key component of Scorsese's screen theology - in attempting to save the life of a middle-aged heart attack victim: the father of Mary (Patricia Arquette) a dowdy, anxious girl clutching her cardigan about her, to whom he is strangely, mutely drawn. </p> <p>Riding around town, Frank is partnered with a variety of others of the paramedic freemasonry: Marcus (Ving Rhames) a lascivious born-again Christian, the good-natured Larry (John Goodman) and the all-but-psychotic Walls (Tom Sizemore) who fantasises about assaulting the timewasters and faeces-encrusted winos he has to deal with. </p> <p>There are, moreover, plenty of typical Scorsese touches, such as a raving nun roaming the streets with a model of an aborted foetus round her neck, addressing the fallen through her megaphone. The problem is that the blood, the guts, the hospital bureaucratic indifference, and the hell-hole of the emergency room do not excite or shock us as once they might, as the whole mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is so familiar from TV shows on both sides of the Atlantic: both hospital dramas and the perennially popular \"real-life emergency\" soft documentary series. They have drawn the sting that Scorsese tries assiduously to reintroduce. </p> <p>It is possible to sit through the entire film waiting for the killer Scorsese punch, waiting for the bolt of directorial lightning which will set this so-so episode of ER ablaze, and take it to a higher level of horror and insight: the next circle of hell. That coup never comes. But what does come is a pleasing, intermittent streak of broad, black comedy: stylish and well-observed, though not satisfactorily absorbed into what is obviously supposed to be a serious whole. </p> <p>Every day, Frank fantasises about being fired from the job, and laying down his terrible burden without the responsibility of quitting. But his captain refuses to fire him, claiming that he himself is on the edge of insanity, and barking like a dog to prove it. Finally, Frank's prayers are answered when his ambulance skids and turns over in the streets, almost killing him. He staggers out, laughing hysterically: \"Oh thank you Jesus!\" Cage's paramedic has come to think of himself as wholly useless medically, but charged with discharging a spiritual responsibility: one whose purpose is to bear witness to suffering and be a \"grief mop\". </p> <p>In a faithless world, the paramedic is the atheist clergyman of the urban emergency, showing up with bag like a priest ready to administer the last rites. It is a fascinating idea, performed with great verve by Cage and the cast, and nothing Scorsese does is ever less than interesting.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a film shoot at the chateau of Rambouillet, near Paris, it appears to be business as usual for the grand, creaky tradition of the historical costume drama. The elderly Parisian aristocracy of the 1910s is seated for a violin recital: the duchesses in their chignons and jewels, messieurs les barons flashing their L\u00e9gion d'Honneur medals. But when the camera tracks slowly round the ballroom walls, something strange happens: the rows of seats, with their august occupants, begin to shunt backwards and forwards and from side to side, the sedate room swimming in a drunkenly unco-ordinated Mexican wave. </p> <p>This is not how you expect costume drama to look, but this is not the average literary adaptation. The book in question is Time Regained, the final volume of Marcel Proust's vast In Search of Lost Time, one of the monuments of supposedly unfilmable modern literature. And it is being adapted by a director not normally associated with costume extravaganzas - Chilean-born, French-based Raul Ruiz, whose name stood, till recently, for all that was most wayward and enigmatic in French experimental film-making. </p> <p>With a cast including Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich and Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, Time Regained did impressive box-office business in France last summer, causing a sudden explosion in Proust paperback sales. </p> <p>Ruiz had previously haunted cinema's wilder no-budget margins. He specialises in surreal, elliptical works that resemble inscrutable dreams. A wildly prolific director, Ruiz has made over 90 films by a recent estimation - of various lengths and in various languages, including a recent one in Mandarin, shot in Taiwan. Ruiz is often compared to Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and even more often to Orson Welles, whose fragmentary, off-the-cuff career his own rather echoes. But for sheer perplexing strangeness, there is no director like him: devotees can't get enough of his work, though even the staunchest admit to being baffled by much of it. </p> <p>One critic has called Ruiz \"the least neurotic of all film-makers\"; he gamely takes on one project after the other, tries out the ideas that interest him, then blithely passes on to the next. Tubby, soft-spoken and avuncular, Ruiz comes across as a genuine intellectual game-player, introducing the most arcane references into his conversation (philosophy, theology, mathematics) just to see where the train of thought leads.</p> <p>He explains the (relatively) mainstream new path he has taken over the last few years. \"I had no audience. Not just a limited audience, but no audience at all. I'm still making the same kind of films, but I've found a way to do it without running economic risks.\" At first he felt this was giving in, but he listened to a friend's suggestion: \"He told me that instead of making films that preoccupied me during the night, I should make films about the things we talk about at table.\" </p> <p>Not that Ruiz's supposedly mainstream new work is conventional by anyone else's standards: it includes Three Lives and Only One Death, a comedy about multiple personality disorder, and the truly bizarre Shattered Image, about two women, each of whom is dreaming the other, in a skewed take on the straight-to-video erotic thriller - the only Ruiz film that could conceivably turn up on late-night Channel 5. </p> <p>Bizarrely, Ruiz regards Shattered Image, for technical reasons, as a dry run for Time Regained. For Ruiz, Proust is as much a film-maker as a writer, a pioneer of flashbacks and dissolves. It's all to do with techniques of time. Hence the moving rows of seats, Ruiz explains. \"How is it that if time is a dimension, we never see it in its totality, only in scraps? But for Proust, all of time is constantly present - it's a dimension, like space. To see that, you need to make space uncertain - move the walls, move the actors at the same time as you use zooms and tracking shots. If you're uncertain about space, then time starts to work differently.\" </p> <p>Time Regained is the latest and most successful assault on the Proustian mountain. Both Joseph Losey and Luchino Visconti failed to get Proust films made, while German directors Percy Adlon (Celeste) and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (Swann in Love) made honourable but partial attempts. If Ruiz's own version seems dizzyingly bizarre at times, it's only because he has chosen to stay faithful to the text. \"The more closely you follow Proust, the more surreal the film becomes.\" </p> <p>Ruiz's career easily rivals Proust's novel for complexity. Over the last four decades, he has been involved in university teaching, comic strips, exhibitions, plays (in his teens, he wrote 100 for a bet), and abstruse but provocative writing on the theory of cinema. He was born in Puerto Montt, Chile, in 1941, to a maths teacher mother and a father who was a merchant navy captain - hence the frequent references to sea voyages in his work, notably his dazzling reworking of the Flying Dutchman myth, Three Crowns of the Sailor, in 1982. He grew up on the obscurest American B-movies, by arcane directors such as Ford Beebe and Reginald Le Borg. He studied theology - as a joke, he says, although the point was to take it seriously. </p> <p>In the mid-60s, Ruiz worked in Mexico writing for soap operas, but only the endings of episodes; to keep himself amused, he would insert chunks of Ezra Pound and TS Eliot into the scripts. \"I worked in the whole of the first part of The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock. I only had to change two words, and it didn't shock anyone in the least.\"</p> <p>Ruiz started making his own films in Chile in the 60s.

      "bodyText": "On a film shoot at the chateau of Rambouillet, near Paris, it appears to be business as usual for the grand, creaky tradition of the historical costume drama. The elderly Parisian aristocracy of the 1910s is seated for a violin recital: the duchesses in their chignons and jewels, messieurs les barons flashing their L\u00e9gion d'Honneur medals. But when the camera tracks slowly round the ballroom walls, something strange happens: the rows of seats, with their august occupants, begin to shunt backwards and forwards and from side to side, the sedate room swimming in a drunkenly unco-ordinated Mexican wave. This is not how you expect costume drama to look, but this is not the average literary adaptation. The book in question is Time Regained, the final volume of Marcel Proust's vast In Search of Lost Time, one of the monuments of supposedly unfilmable modern literature. And it is being adapted by a director not normally associated with costume extravaganzas - Chilean-born, French-based Raul Ruiz, whose name stood, till recently, for all that was most wayward and enigmatic in French experimental film-making. With a cast including Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich and Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, Time Regained did impressive box-office business in France last summer, causing a sudden explosion in Proust paperback sales. Ruiz had previously haunted cinema's wilder no-budget margins. He specialises in surreal, elliptical works that resemble inscrutable dreams. A wildly prolific director, Ruiz has made over 90 films by a recent estimation - of various lengths and in various languages, including a recent one in Mandarin, shot in Taiwan. Ruiz is often compared to Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and even more often to Orson Welles, whose fragmentary, off-the-cuff career his own rather echoes. But for sheer perplexing strangeness, there is no director like him: devotees can't get enough of his work, though even the staunchest admit to being baffled by much of it. One critic has called Ruiz \"the least neurotic of all film-makers\"; he gamely takes on one project after the other, tries out the ideas that interest him, then blithely passes on to the next. Tubby, soft-spoken and avuncular, Ruiz comes across as a genuine intellectual game-player, introducing the most arcane references into his conversation (philosophy, theology, mathematics) just to see where the train of thought leads. He explains the (relatively) mainstream new path he has taken over the last few years. \"I had no audience. Not just a limited audience, but no audience at all. I'm still making the same kind of films, but I've found a way to do it without running economic risks.\" At first he felt this was giving in, but he listened to a friend's suggestion: \"He told me that instead of making films that preoccupied me during the night, I should make films about the things we talk about at table.\" Not that Ruiz's supposedly mainstream new work is conventional by anyone else's standards: it includes Three Lives and Only One Death, a comedy about multiple personality disorder, and the truly bizarre Shattered Image, about two women, each of whom is dreaming the other, in a skewed take on the straight-to-video erotic thriller - the only Ruiz film that could conceivably turn up on late-night Channel 5. Bizarrely, Ruiz regards Shattered Image, for technical reasons, as a dry run for Time Regained. For Ruiz, Proust is as much a film-maker as a writer, a pioneer of flashbacks and dissolves. It's all to do with techniques of time. Hence the moving rows of seats, Ruiz explains. \"How is it that if time is a dimension, we never see it in its totality, only in scraps? But for Proust, all of time is constantly present - it's a dimension, like space. To see that, you need to make space uncertain - move the walls, move the actors at the same time as you use zooms and tracking shots. If you're uncertain about space, then time starts to work differently.\" Time Regained is the latest and most successful assault on the Proustian mountain. Both Joseph Losey and Luchino Visconti failed to get Proust films made, while German directors Percy Adlon (Celeste) and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (Swann in Love) made honourable but partial attempts. If Ruiz's own version seems dizzyingly bizarre at times, it's only because he has chosen to stay faithful to the text. \"The more closely you follow Proust, the more surreal the film becomes.\" Ruiz's career easily rivals Proust's novel for complexity. Over the last four decades, he has been involved in university teaching, comic strips, exhibitions, plays (in his teens, he wrote 100 for a bet), and abstruse but provocative writing on the theory of cinema. He was born in Puerto Montt, Chile, in 1941, to a maths teacher mother and a father who was a merchant navy captain - hence the frequent references to sea voyages in his work, notably his dazzling reworking of the Flying Dutchman myth, Three Crowns of the Sailor, in 1982. He grew up on the obscurest American B-movies, by arcane directors such as Ford Beebe and Reginald Le Borg. He studied theology - as a joke, he says, although the point was to take it seriously. In the mid-60s, Ruiz worked in Mexico writing for soap operas, but only the endings of episodes; to keep himself amused, he would insert chunks of Ezra Pound and TS Eliot into the scripts. \"I worked in the whole of the first part of The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock. I only had to change two words, and it didn't shock anyone in the least.\" Ruiz started making his own films in Chile in the 60s. His first feature was the frenetic urban drama Three Sad Tigers, shot with the actors plastered in Vaseline, to make them look permanently sweaty. \"It was a Dogme film,\" Ruiz jokes. \"One lens, all hand-held, and certain rules - one was that the actors had to go and find the camera, while the camera avoided them.\" At one point, Ruiz was given the job of film adviser to Salvador Allende's Socialist party. When Pinochet seized power in 1973, Ruiz was due to start shooting a film about the predicted coup d'\u00e9tat the very next day. He left the country in October that year, \"just when the first film-makers were being imprisoned. The arrests at that point were completely arbitrary and very chaotic - people were being shot just because they had moustaches.\" Ruiz moved to Paris with his wife Valeria Sarmiento, herself a film-maker, and both established their careers there. He collaborates on the scripts of her films, and she often edits his, but they never co-direct. \"We once tried to make a TV programme on Chilean cookery, and we argued so much we decided never to do it again.\" Since settling in France, Ruiz has made a trademark of taking on brief commissions alongside his features, for the opportunity to put his distinctive stamp on them: hence his documentaries on French politics and history, and strange, fragmentary shorts on everything from ice-breakers to Velazquez. But all his films, Ruiz says, refer to each other. \"Oddly, it's the smallest and the most badly made which are the most complex. I've made four-minute films that are much harder to take in than my two-hour ones.\" Ruiz has eight projects lined up for the next two years - on paper at least - including another US thriller and a version of The Picture of Dorian Gray, written by British novelist and critic Gilbert Adair. How Ruiz crams it all in is the enduring mystery. He divides his time in three, he explains, \"a third for film-making, a third for theatre, a third for doing nothing, spending time at home or looking at the ceiling.\" It's not quite that simple, though, since looking at the ceiling usually gives him ideas for films. Ruiz gives a typically roundabout example. He reads a lot on set; filming in Portugal once, he was relaxing with a theological treatise which proposed that each atom of the human body had its own immortal soul.

      "bodyText": "The queues for the dome's body zone disappeared yesterday after its sponsor, Boots, said it was not happy that visitors were being made to wait nearly an hour for the seven-minute experience. The high street chemist, which has yet to pay a penny of its \u00a312m deal, denied it had \"held a gun to the head\" of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), which runs the attraction. But Francis Thomas, Boots's head of media relations, said he was \"heartened\" that a new queuing system had been introduced to cure the embarrassing hiccup as soon as they made their dissatisfaction clear. \"Yes, we have still to sign our sponsorship contract and yes, we are unhappy with the queuing,\" said Mr Thomas. \"But we are not making a link between the two things. \"Although the contract negotiations have still be to be finalised, it is a matter of legal niceties. I cannot stress that enough. We are delighted it is such a big draw. It's a victim of its own success really.\" In addition to Boots, three other sponsors, Mars, Manpower and BSkyB, are yet to sign their \u00a312m sponsorship contracts, although Mars and Manpower have paid a small amount. The Dome needs to raise \u00a3194m in ticket sales this year to meet its budget, but with not a single day sold out in advance NMEC executives are considering new attractions within the Dome complex to boost attendance. Jennie Page, chief executive of NMEC, said the Dome was currently operating at a capacity of 20,000: \"This will be increased during the course of the year, dependent on weather conditions and the progressive introduction of more attractions.\" The capacity of the Dome complex, including outdoor areas is 35,000. Options being considered to boost ticket sales include using outdoor areas for new attractions, a six-month extension to the period the Dome is open, and offering visitors a reduced rate for return visits. Problems with the body zone, the Dome's biggest draw, have been made worse because it is the first thing visitors see when entering. Families who visited yesterday reported that they were able to get inside the body zone within a few minutes, although a spokeswoman for the NMEC admitted that they had \"not been mobbed\" compared to the crowds who descended over the bank holiday. She said the body zone queue was now being redirected through the zone's explore area, which is about the future of medicine, health and beauty, to keep families entertained before they saw the special effects. Ticket sales were soaring ahead of expectations, she said, although the dome would be not be able to reach its 30,000 people a day capacity until later in the year. News that certain sponsorship money had not yet been paid to NMEC was first given by the government in a parliamentary answer before Christmas. Boots's sponsorship package of the body zone is supported by cosmetics giants Roche and L'Oreal, which are believed to be contributing about \u00a31m each. \u0095 The dome has failed to generate a feelgood factor, according to an opinion poll in today's edition of the Economist. It showed that 56% of people thought the government was wrong to build the dome. Thirty five per cent thought it was right and 9% did not know.

She said Shipman had been a caring GP since the 1970s. \"With a list size of 3,100, well above the national average, Dr Shipman must have been doing something right.\" Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, denies murdering the patients and forging the \u00a3386,000 will of one. Miss Davies said: \"The prosecution case is built on one foundation stone and that is toxicology. Without it there would be no case. Toxicology is a new science and untested by proven scientific methods.\" She said the discrepancies in Dr Shipman's records, which the prosecution claimed he used to cover his tracks, were more in keeping with an eccentric practice than a cunning murderer. The trial continues today.",

      "bodyText": "Five new Chinese bishops were ordained yesterday at a solemn ceremony in snowy Beijing - against the wishes of the Pope in Rome. The five knelt in yellow-braided white robes at the altar of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Beijing's oldest church. After receiving their mitres and golden staffs, they walked down the nave in a candle-lit procession with acolytes, nuns and 10 existing bishops. Plainclothes police mingled with a congregation that included Communist party officials as well as nuns and priests. China denies the Pope's right as head of the Roman Catholic church to appoint bishops and cardinals. The five new appointees, like the 70 already holding office, have been chosen by the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The Vatican reacted to the news with \"surprise and disappointment\". A spokesman in Rome said the move created a new obstacle to normal relations - broken since 1951 - between the Holy See and Beijing. The ceremony comes at a critical point in secret talks between Beijing and the Vatican on restoring ties, with Rome seeking a trade-off in which it would recognise the indigenous Chinese church in exchange for the right to approve its own bishops. This is a big sticking point in the Vatican-Beijing talks. At yesterday's ceremony an announcer drove home Beijing's view by declaring that \"the election of the new bishops is valid and legal\". Three of the new bishops are aged less than 40 - exceptionally young by international standards. The bishop of Beijing, Fu Tieshan, described them as \"intelligent and capable\". By appointing the bishops now, Beijing is signalling that no deal will be struck until the larger issue of the Vatican's relations with Taiwan has been settled. The Vatican said last year it was willing to transfer its China nunciature from Taipei to Beijing - but without ceasing to recognise Taiwan, as Beijing insists. Its other condition is that China must not use religion to \"interfere in China's internal affairs\" - a restriction at odds with the fight for human rights that Catholic churchmen have conducted in several countries. The Pope is known to be anxious to achieve reconciliation with China, particularly in the first year of the new millennium. He referred repeatedly to China last November during a speech in India, and said Asia was \"thirsting for the living water that Jesus alone can give\". Tentative plans for the Pope to visit Hong Kong and Macau were scrapped under Chinese pressure. The official church in China claims 4m members, but many millions more are believed to worship in illegal \"house churches\", where worship takes place secretly in locations that sometimes include caves or derelict buildings. Many of these churches were formed secretly during China's cultural revolution of the 60s, when practising Christians risked being sent to labour camps. China would like to normalise relations with the Vatican partly so that it can move more effectively against the house churches. Militant Catholics abroad have criticised the Vatican for holding talks that could result in its abandoning China's \"illegal\" Catholics. The number of Christians - Catholics and Protestants - in China has increased significantly since the early 80s in a countrywide religious revival especially marked among poorer urban dwellers and peasants. All the major faiths, including Buddhism and Daoism, have benefited from the Communist party's loss of spiritual appeal. Semi-mystical cults have also sprung up, and one sect, Falun Gong, has so worried the authorities that they have banned it.",

Members wanted to know more about the proposals for electoral reform and to be involved in the debate. A clear majority of local members favoured the Jenkins proposals, and even those who were undecided, or against electoral reform, agreed that a referendum should be held.</p> <p>I support electoral reform on a point of principle. The Commons has to be representative of the votes people cast. But it is equally important to recognise that electoral reform will benefit the Labour party and the people we represent too. The current system allowed Conservatives to dominate the 20th century. If we want the 21st century to be different, our starting point has to be a system that doesn't give the Tories an inbuilt advantage. We need to recognise that it is not for those of us with a selfish interest in maintaining the status quo to decide how we elect the MPs of the future. It's time to let the people decide. <b><br>Oona King, MP</b></p> <p>\u0095 Thanks to Martin Linton (Comment, January 6), we now find that the only basis for the story is an unknown spinner at Millbank and an AEEU official delivering a box containing 1,000 signed identical postcards. A pathetic kind of block postcard vote. Why don't the AEEU ballot their members before trying to hijack party policy? As far as I know, my union, Unison, is the only union to have held such a ballot. This came out in favour of electoral reform, with 707 votes for and 538 against. The tiny turnout in our ballot and the equally small numbers in the AEEU's postcard petition only point to the need for the consultation to become more real. <br><b>Stuart Hill</b><br>Unison executive member, Darlington</p> <p>\u0095 Where is this \"overwhelming support\" for our existing electoral system? In Labour party meetings throughout the country in recent months, I have found little other than healthy discussion on how we can make our democracy work better. I now await the report of the party's policy forum with optimism. <br><b>Dr Ken Ritchie </b><br>Chief executive, Electoral Reform Society</p> <p>\u0095 Many people - not least Liberal Democrats and Labour voters who voted tactically to beat Conservative candidates in 1997 - will feel betrayed if a clear pledge for a referendum is not honoured. John Smith and Tony Blair both said the British people should decide on how they want to elect their MPs. <br><b>Neil Sherlock</b><br> Farncombe, Surrey</p> <p>\u0095 Before the scaremongering is allowed to take over any further, we need to look back to what the Jenkins report specifically recommended. Jenkins balanced contradictory remits in order to uphold certain benefits of the status quo, whilst redressing its many flaws. AVplus can produce decisive government and retain the important constituency link. In addition the proposals would ensure a more representative result at elections, making each vote count fairly. Jenkins was not just offering a solution which would benefit one party, but instead strove to keep politics near to the people, as it should be.</p> <p>The public has nothing to be scared of in PR and this has to be reflected in future debates, as we cannot allow this choice to be made so lightly in the expected referendum. Instead the focus should be shifted onto the disturbing lack of public education surrounding this preliminary decision. Labour's programme of constitutional reform has the ultimate aim of restoring faith in politics; if this is to be achieved, we need to have this referendum. <br><b>Pam Giddy</b><br> Director, Charter 88</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency Labour party held its policy forum on electoral reform at the beginning of December, I detected none of the hostility you report (Party hits Blair's hopes of PR reform, January 5). Members wanted to know more about the proposals for electoral reform and to be involved in the debate. A clear majority of local members favoured the Jenkins proposals, and even those who were undecided, or against electoral reform, agreed that a referendum should be held. I support electoral reform on a point of principle. The Commons has to be representative of the votes people cast. But it is equally important to recognise that electoral reform will benefit the Labour party and the people we represent too. The current system allowed Conservatives to dominate the 20th century. If we want the 21st century to be different, our starting point has to be a system that doesn't give the Tories an inbuilt advantage. We need to recognise that it is not for those of us with a selfish interest in maintaining the status quo to decide how we elect the MPs of the future. It's time to let the people decide. Oona King, MP \u0095 Thanks to Martin Linton (Comment, January 6), we now find that the only basis for the story is an unknown spinner at Millbank and an AEEU official delivering a box containing 1,000 signed identical postcards. A pathetic kind of block postcard vote. Why don't the AEEU ballot their members before trying to hijack party policy? As far as I know, my union, Unison, is the only union to have held such a ballot. This came out in favour of electoral reform, with 707 votes for and 538 against. The tiny turnout in our ballot and the equally small numbers in the AEEU's postcard petition only point to the need for the consultation to become more real. Stuart Hill Unison executive member, Darlington \u0095 Where is this \"overwhelming support\" for our existing electoral system? In Labour party meetings throughout the country in recent months, I have found little other than healthy discussion on how we can make our democracy work better. I now await the report of the party's policy forum with optimism. Dr Ken Ritchie Chief executive, Electoral Reform Society \u0095 Many people - not least Liberal Democrats and Labour voters who voted tactically to beat Conservative candidates in 1997 - will feel betrayed if a clear pledge for a referendum is not honoured. John Smith and Tony Blair both said the British people should decide on how they want to elect their MPs. Neil Sherlock Farncombe, Surrey \u0095 Before the scaremongering is allowed to take over any further, we need to look back to what the Jenkins report specifically recommended. Jenkins balanced contradictory remits in order to uphold certain benefits of the status quo, whilst redressing its many flaws. AVplus can produce decisive government and retain the important constituency link. In addition the proposals would ensure a more representative result at elections, making each vote count fairly. Jenkins was not just offering a solution which would benefit one party, but instead strove to keep politics near to the people, as it should be. The public has nothing to be scared of in PR and this has to be reflected in future debates, as we cannot allow this choice to be made so lightly in the expected referendum. Instead the focus should be shifted onto the disturbing lack of public education surrounding this preliminary decision. Labour's programme of constitutional reform has the ultimate aim of restoring faith in politics; if this is to be achieved, we need to have this referendum. Pam Giddy Director, Charter 88",

The link will be direct, unsullied by the \"distorting prism of the media\". Faced with such generous offers, who but a cynic could cavil? But cavil we do.</p> <p>For whose benefit, essentially, is this enterprise designed? For us, the consumers? Or for the state-aided ease and comfort and political advantage of those running the show? If for us, one might have expected to see a policy enshrining our right to know - a principle so inadequately served by the freedom of information bill. What consultations preceded the exercise? Cabinet approved it; but did they debate it, or simply speed it through? And what does the civil service make of it?</p> <p>If it is not alarmed, then it should be, at the implications which pulse through the paper that civil servants - whose right and duty it is not to become mere obedient conduits of government policy - will have that impartiality sapped; will find themselves caught in an exercise appropriate in some respects to a ministry of propaganda. And may not this tastefully named Knowledge Network Project ease gracefully, as the election approaches, into a souped-up version of the Excalibur project which served Labour so well in 1997? Only this time, of course, funded by taxpayers.</p> <p>Any complacency about what is involved must surely be dispersed by the section headed: Informing parliaments, the public and the world. This distinguishes between information open to all and other information which needs to be handled \"sensitively\".</p> <p>What is the latest stated government policy? Where and by whom was it stated? What are the three best arguments for it, and the five best facts in its favour? Which non-governmental organisations are known to support it? Here is information we can all of us joyously share. But what are the most recent developments in policy? What judgments have others made of it? What criticisms have been launched at it? That is where shutters come down. The principle behind these distinctions is not clearly stated. But it does not need to be.</p> <p>The world's most advanced government knowledge management system will tell the people who pay for it all about those aspects of government action likely to leave them satisfied, likely to make them feel that they live in the best of all possible worlds, while doing its highly professional best to stifle the rest.</p> <p>All governments play these games. But none before in peacetime can have sought to play them so lavishly, making centralisation a religion, trampling on diversity, doing its best to ensure that from Mr Blair down through the government ranks and into the civil service, we are permitted to hear but one voice. While stroppy people remain in government, while others in the machine find other ways of making their dissension plain, while leaks persist and leak inquiries fail, the grand strategy will fall short of perfection.</p> <p>But will there always be stroppy people about, or will those who resist the world's most advanced government knowledge management system pay the traditional price? You do not need a distorting prism to fear what might develop once these powers are allowed to a government - any government, even a Labour one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is an exciting moment. This country, the Guardian has discovered, is about to be treated to what its devisers call the most advanced government knowledge management system anywhere in the world. Information will wing its way from the government to the people faster than ever before. No longer will they need to consult several separate departments: this is to be a joined up exercise, all departments plugged into each other. The link will be direct, unsullied by the \"distorting prism of the media\". Faced with such generous offers, who but a cynic could cavil? But cavil we do. For whose benefit, essentially, is this enterprise designed? For us, the consumers? Or for the state-aided ease and comfort and political advantage of those running the show? If for us, one might have expected to see a policy enshrining our right to know - a principle so inadequately served by the freedom of information bill. What consultations preceded the exercise? Cabinet approved it; but did they debate it, or simply speed it through? And what does the civil service make of it? If it is not alarmed, then it should be, at the implications which pulse through the paper that civil servants - whose right and duty it is not to become mere obedient conduits of government policy - will have that impartiality sapped; will find themselves caught in an exercise appropriate in some respects to a ministry of propaganda. And may not this tastefully named Knowledge Network Project ease gracefully, as the election approaches, into a souped-up version of the Excalibur project which served Labour so well in 1997? Only this time, of course, funded by taxpayers. Any complacency about what is involved must surely be dispersed by the section headed: Informing parliaments, the public and the world. This distinguishes between information open to all and other information which needs to be handled \"sensitively\". What is the latest stated government policy? Where and by whom was it stated? What are the three best arguments for it, and the five best facts in its favour? Which non-governmental organisations are known to support it? Here is information we can all of us joyously share. But what are the most recent developments in policy? What judgments have others made of it? What criticisms have been launched at it? That is where shutters come down. The principle behind these distinctions is not clearly stated. But it does not need to be. The world's most advanced government knowledge management system will tell the people who pay for it all about those aspects of government action likely to leave them satisfied, likely to make them feel that they live in the best of all possible worlds, while doing its highly professional best to stifle the rest. All governments play these games. But none before in peacetime can have sought to play them so lavishly, making centralisation a religion, trampling on diversity, doing its best to ensure that from Mr Blair down through the government ranks and into the civil service, we are permitted to hear but one voice. While stroppy people remain in government, while others in the machine find other ways of making their dissension plain, while leaks persist and leak inquiries fail, the grand strategy will fall short of perfection. But will there always be stroppy people about, or will those who resist the world's most advanced government knowledge management system pay the traditional price? You do not need a distorting prism to fear what might develop once these powers are allowed to a government - any government, even a Labour one.",

But, in reality, police superintendents bear little resemblance to plodding dinosaurs who short-sightedly badger the likes of detective officers Morse and Frost in the TV dramas. They are more likely to resemble The Bill's wily Chief Superintendent Charles Brownlow, it was revealed at the conference. David Wigfield, an occupational psychologist with Sussex police unveiled research into 109 superintendents in 31 police forces across England and Wales. The psychologist, who is studying for a PhD at Sussex university, questioned 1,200 officers to assess how the superintendents were perceived by their colleagues. His findings suggested the senior officers were self-aware, decisive, fairly in touch with their officers, well-regarded and hands-on. Mr Wigfield said television dramas such as Morse and A Touch of Frost focused on a hero who was invariably misunderstood by his superior - \"usually a dinosaur who is perceived as out of touch\". But they shared a similarity with their TV counterparts, Chief Superintendent Strange in Morse, and Superintendent Mullett in A Touch of Frost. \"They are not seen as particularly good at motivating people.\" The senior television police officer who most reflected reality was Chief Superintendent Brownlow, the highly conventional but hands-on boss in ITV's The Bill.",

      "body": "<p>Republicans clashed with police in Dublin last night as they tried to halt a convoy returning an IRA murderer, Angelo Fusco, to prison after a high court judge dramatically rejected his appeal for bail.</p> <p>The protesters exchanged punches with Gardai as the officers struggled to secure a way through for the three car convoy taking Fusco, 43, to Castlerea prison in Co Roscommon. The low security jail houses the seven other IRA terrorists still held in the republic.</p> <p>At the hastily arranged hearing, Fusco, a member of the IRA's M-60 gang, did however win the right to challenge attempts to return him to Northern Ireland, where he was jailed in his absence for 30 years after being convicted of the murder of an SAS captain in north Belfast in 1980. His lawyers argued yesterday that the changed political climate meant that extraditing him would be a \"futile exercise\".</p> <p>Mr Justice Joseph Finnegan, whose decision three days ago prevented Gardai handing Fusco back into RUC custody as they were driving him north, rejected the fugitive's plea for bail. Police had expected privately it would be granted.</p> <p>Martin Ferris, a Sinn Fein executive member, last night hinted that this week's furore over Fusco could affect the IRA's imminent decision on whether to decommission its weapons. An IRA representative is expected to hold a second meeting today with John de Chastelain, the general who chairs the decommissioning body.</p> <p>After calming the fighting at the high court, where one man was arrested, Mr Ferris spoke of enormous anger among republicans. He called on the Irish government to halt the extradition, and said it was undermining the confidence built around the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>He said: \"The man has spent 12 years in prison. It doesn't make sense at this time for the Dublin government to attempt to extradite Angelo Fusco back to the Six Counties when the prisoners are now being released. There is no logical understanding in it.\"</p> <p>Fusco was arrested late on Monday after offering a false driving licence when he was stopped at a routine police checkpoint close to his family home in Tralee, Co Kerry. He told the court yesterday that he used the counterfeit licence to give the traffic constable who recognised him an excuse to let him go.</p> <p>His arrest and the move to extradite him on existing warrants are embarrassing for the British and Irish governments. Sources from each admit they would rather the police had turned a blind eye.</p> <p>If Fusco were returned, he would be free in July under the early release scheme. Mr Justice Finnegan indicated yesterday that if his judical review were to go on more than three months, he would consider a fresh application for bail.</p> <p>The M-60 gang, responsible for killing eight security force members and a suspected RUC informer, surrendered after shooting Captain Herbert Westmacott, 28, as he tried to prevent an attack on a nearby RUC station. His wife, Victoria, was pregnant at the time.</p> <p>Fusco shot his way out of Crumlin Road courthouse with his six-co-accused in June 1981 just before he was sentenced to life with a recommendation he serve at least 30 years. He was arrested in the republic six months later, and spent 10 years in Portlaoise prison for the Belfast jailbreak and a subsequent escape attempt.</p> <p>On his release in January 1992, he was immediately served with a warrant to return him to Northern Ireland to serve his sentence for murder, and began a six-year battle to avoid extradition while on bail. He finally lost in the Irish supreme court in February 1998, again apparently disappearing before the verdict.</p> <p>Garda Paul Brown told the court he had stopped Fusco, driving a British-registered white Transit, at a drink-drive roadblock. He recognised him, and radioed for assistance after Fusco presented him with a Northern Ireland driving licence with his photograph but in another name.</p> <p>Detective Sergeant Kevin Dillon, who arrived to arrest Fusco, said he had regularly checked over the past two years to see if he was at the home he had shared with his wife Mary, and children, Elaine, 26, Joe, 20, and 18-year-old Maria. He never asked Mrs Fusco where her husband was, saying: \"I believed she wouldn't tell me.\"</p> <p>Fusco denied he had been on the run. He said he had lived at home for six weeks after the supreme court verdict, before going to live with his brother in Coolock, Dublin, where he worked as a part-time builder, but returned to Tralee at weekends. He had a false Northern Ireland licence so that he could go there. He was also found to have a counterfeit Irish licence in the van. Fusco said: \"I have always honoured my bail. If I was to lose, I would serve no more than six months. It would not be in my benefit to abscond.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Republicans clashed with police in Dublin last night as they tried to halt a convoy returning an IRA murderer, Angelo Fusco, to prison after a high court judge dramatically rejected his appeal for bail. The protesters exchanged punches with Gardai as the officers struggled to secure a way through for the three car convoy taking Fusco, 43, to Castlerea prison in Co Roscommon. The low security jail houses the seven other IRA terrorists still held in the republic. At the hastily arranged hearing, Fusco, a member of the IRA's M-60 gang, did however win the right to challenge attempts to return him to Northern Ireland, where he was jailed in his absence for 30 years after being convicted of the murder of an SAS captain in north Belfast in 1980. His lawyers argued yesterday that the changed political climate meant that extraditing him would be a \"futile exercise\". Mr Justice Joseph Finnegan, whose decision three days ago prevented Gardai handing Fusco back into RUC custody as they were driving him north, rejected the fugitive's plea for bail. Police had expected privately it would be granted. Martin Ferris, a Sinn Fein executive member, last night hinted that this week's furore over Fusco could affect the IRA's imminent decision on whether to decommission its weapons. An IRA representative is expected to hold a second meeting today with John de Chastelain, the general who chairs the decommissioning body. After calming the fighting at the high court, where one man was arrested, Mr Ferris spoke of enormous anger among republicans. He called on the Irish government to halt the extradition, and said it was undermining the confidence built around the Good Friday agreement. He said: \"The man has spent 12 years in prison. It doesn't make sense at this time for the Dublin government to attempt to extradite Angelo Fusco back to the Six Counties when the prisoners are now being released. There is no logical understanding in it.\" Fusco was arrested late on Monday after offering a false driving licence when he was stopped at a routine police checkpoint close to his family home in Tralee, Co Kerry. He told the court yesterday that he used the counterfeit licence to give the traffic constable who recognised him an excuse to let him go. His arrest and the move to extradite him on existing warrants are embarrassing for the British and Irish governments. Sources from each admit they would rather the police had turned a blind eye. If Fusco were returned, he would be free in July under the early release scheme. Mr Justice Finnegan indicated yesterday that if his judical review were to go on more than three months, he would consider a fresh application for bail. The M-60 gang, responsible for killing eight security force members and a suspected RUC informer, surrendered after shooting Captain Herbert Westmacott, 28, as he tried to prevent an attack on a nearby RUC station. His wife, Victoria, was pregnant at the time. Fusco shot his way out of Crumlin Road courthouse with his six-co-accused in June 1981 just before he was sentenced to life with a recommendation he serve at least 30 years. He was arrested in the republic six months later, and spent 10 years in Portlaoise prison for the Belfast jailbreak and a subsequent escape attempt. On his release in January 1992, he was immediately served with a warrant to return him to Northern Ireland to serve his sentence for murder, and began a six-year battle to avoid extradition while on bail. He finally lost in the Irish supreme court in February 1998, again apparently disappearing before the verdict. Garda Paul Brown told the court he had stopped Fusco, driving a British-registered white Transit, at a drink-drive roadblock. He recognised him, and radioed for assistance after Fusco presented him with a Northern Ireland driving licence with his photograph but in another name. Detective Sergeant Kevin Dillon, who arrived to arrest Fusco, said he had regularly checked over the past two years to see if he was at the home he had shared with his wife Mary, and children, Elaine, 26, Joe, 20, and 18-year-old Maria. He never asked Mrs Fusco where her husband was, saying: \"I believed she wouldn't tell me.\" Fusco denied he had been on the run. He said he had lived at home for six weeks after the supreme court verdict, before going to live with his brother in Coolock, Dublin, where he worked as a part-time builder, but returned to Tralee at weekends. He had a false Northern Ireland licence so that he could go there. He was also found to have a counterfeit Irish licence in the van. Fusco said: \"I have always honoured my bail. If I was to lose, I would serve no more than six months. It would not be in my benefit to abscond.\"",

The faulty gauge, the altitude director indicator (ADI), failed on the Boeing 747's penultimate flight from Tashkent to Stansted, and despite being worked on by ground crew at the airport failed again shortly before the plane crashed minutes after taking off on December 22. A Korean Air engineer killed in the accident along with three other crew members was among those who examined the instrument. The report, which reaches no conclusion about the cause of the crash, says the crew was warned that the instrument was faulty after take-off. Both captain and co-pilot would have had ADIs, and the fault became apparent on the previous flight. The flight engineer told a Korean Air ground engineer the captain's gauge was faulty and that he and a Stansted-based maintenance engineer had worked on the fault. The local engineer told investigators that \"the operator's [Korean Air] engineer said that he would complete the technical log\". No copy of the log was left at Stansted. Last night it emerged that the tail of the 747 contained 300kg of depleted uranium as a counter-weight, and that emergency services may have been exposed to radioactive uranium oxide.

The project aims to collect in one database every line for ministers and civil servants to take on every key government policy, and to provide them with the ammunition to deal with criticism on policy from MPs, the media and the public. As part of the preparations every Whitehall department has already been asked to outline its existing arrangements to handle attacks on policy, including from MPs, and whether it has an early warning system. The cabinet office paper cites food safety policy as the sort of high profile and hugely controversial issue which would benefit from this new approach. All ministers, including the prime minister, face the possibility of being questioned in an atmosphere where there are \"members of the press or pressure groups hoping to seize on any evidence of inconsistency across government\". In this situation a computer network into which \"every department can feed and from which every department can read\" will help ensure the government works off a \"common script\".

It also recommends building up within the database information on the government's most persistent critics and the official response to their arguments. Until now the government has not, as a matter of routine, produced information broken down by political constituency unless requested by a specific parliamentary question as the country is run by local authority, police force, NHS trust or commuter area and such data is generally only of use in party political campaigning. But using the justification of prime minister's question time, the cabinet approved paper proposes that that should now become a matter of routine. The paper makes clear that the object of this is to be able to tell parents in Durham about smaller classes in their schools, or to explain how the working families tax credit has benefited a parent in Worcester. It adds that the \"automatic mapping\" of such information to BBC or ITV regions, local radio, local and regional newspapers, as well as parliamentary constituencies will help spread the benefits of government policy at local level. The database is justified in the name of providing the public with greater access to government information. But the paper makes clear only certain types of information will be available to the public. \"There might also be information which it would be unnecessary or unwise to have shared freely with all other departments, published on the internet or sent out in a letter to the public.\" For example, the \"best three arguments\" or \"best five facts\" supporting a particular government policy will be available to the public but \"the most recent developments\" in that policy, depending on sensitivity, will be restricted to policy officials, private offices and parliamentary clerks in selected departments. Similarly, lists of people and organisations outside government who support official policy will be made public but the names of critics and their arguments will be restricted to key staff \"for use only when attacks are made\". Mr McCrea says that all ministers, civil servants and political advisers are to be given automatic security codes which will determine the level of access they may have to the database. There are to be three levels of access: open, restricted and confidential.

The system, named the Knowledge Network Project, is being developed by Frank Dobson's former spin doctor, Joe McCrea, with a team based in the cabinet office and is many times more powerful than the Excalibur database used by Labour in the run-up to the last general election. The overall aim of the project is to \"explain the government's core message\" so that citizens can get the \"full facts without going through the distorting prism of media reporting.\" It is to be a computer network into which every department can feed their \"lines to take\" on every key issue and \"from which every department can read,\" according to cabinet office documents passed to the Guardian.

Mo Mowlam, the cabinet enforcer, has invited all other cabinet ministers to participate in the project and an initial \"communications audit\" is due to be completed by each government department by next Friday. A minister in each department is being given specific responsibility for their participation. The initial communications audit not only includes an assessment of the state of computerisation in Whitehall but also asks each department to outline whether they have \"one-stop shops for policy lines to take\" and have early warning systems and rapid response operations to attacks on their policy and practice. Mr McCrea, who is on contract to the cabinet office, and loosely accountable to the Downing Street information and research unit under Bill Bush, has been given the job of \"rolling-out\" the system across Whitehall. Based on Lotus Notes software, it is designed to build up a single database of the government's line to take on every key policy issue raised across Whitehall. He suggests it should not just include the latest statement of government policy but also the three best arguments and five best facts in its support. Although developed on the promise to deliver citizens with \"the full facts - without media distortion\", the public will be told who outside government supports a particular policy but they won't be told who is critical of it nor will they be told of the \"latest developments in policy\" if they are considered too sensitive. But the new system also breaks with past Whitehall practice in that it will log data on a political constituency basis which has never been done before as a matter of routine except by specific parliamentary question. This is being done on the grounds that the information will be used by Tony Blair at prime minister's question time but it also turns it into a potentially very powerful political campaign tool in an election. The data will also be processed by \"automatic mapping\" so it is broken down by BBC and ITV television region, local radio and local newspaper circulation areas as well by constituency so that the \"benefits of government policy can be better explained at a local level.\" Examples cited in the leaked cabinet office paper include telling residents in a particular constituency how many of them have benefited from lower rates of income tax or from the new deal for the unemployed. Ministers are to be offered a 24-hour all-year-round service with the database accessible to them from a laptop computer at home or abroad. No longer will they have any excuse not to know the \"line to take\" as a result of a project which promises to deliver \"the most modern and advanced government knowledge system anywhere in the world.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mo Mowlam has reportedly been placed \"on trial\" by Tony Blair, to be unceremoniously removed from the cabinet if she repeats the mistakes she made in Belfast. The prime minister, who removed Ms Mowlam from Northern Ireland last year against her will, is said to still find her exasperating. He reportedly would not flinch from ending her ministerial career, despite her popularity within the Labour party. The gloomy assessment of Ms Mowlam's prospects came in a New Statesman article by Steve Richards, the magazine's political editor, who is close to senior figures in Downing Street. Under the headline Mo Mowlam's fall from grace, Mr Richards quoted a \"Blair aide\" as saying that the cabinet office minister was on trial and would not be given another chance if she failed. One aide underlined her delicate position by explaining in dismissive terms why the prime minister had refused to grant her request to be made health secretary when he moved her from being Northern Ireland secretary last year. \"Mowlam has the touch of Bill Clinton but lacks his ability to immerse himself in policy detail,\" the aide was reported as saying. Ms Mowlam's supporters last night dismissed the article as \"pointless speculation\". They said that she remained a key member of the cabinet, whose central role had been confirmed when the prime minister placed her in charge of the government's social exclusion unit. However, Ms Mowlam faced a wretched year in 1999, which saw her receiving a dismal reception at the Labour conference one year after she upstaged Mr Blair at the conference by receiving a standing ovation during his speech. One supporter of Ms Mowlam underlined the strained relations with Downing Street by saying that she had been deliberately snubbed at last year's conference by being given a speaking slot just after lunch. \"Another big standing ovation might have made it difficult again for Blair to move her,\" he said. The one-time darling of the Labour party was said to be so angry at the Blairites' portrayal of her as a failure in Belfast that she was planning to use her much-publicised forthcoming book to set the record straight. One Mowlam supporter told the magazine: \"Tony used to phone Mo virtually every Sunday to discuss the situation, and for much of the time he was asking her what was happening, not the other way round.\" This contrasts with the remarks of Blair supporters during her time in Belfast when they said that the prime minister was spending his life rescuing Ms Mowlam after she had alienated unionists with her incautious remarks over issues - such as the principle of consent. Ms Mowlam, who will today make a visit to Brighton as part of her role in tackling social exclusion, will take heart that Mr Richards wrote that the prime minister still retained \"affection and respect for her skills and courage\". \"Some influential Blairites believe she could be in her last job in government,\" Mr Richards writes. \"It is at least as likely that she will be the only woman from Blair's first cabinet to survive into a second term.\"",

The filming is actually just part of a massive cohort study by the Bristol-based Avon Longitudinal Studies of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). The BBC have 10 families lined up ready to give birth to the unwitting stars of the 90-minute BBC1 documentary that will kick the whole thing off. Testing everything from old wives' tales to the latest genetic theories, the project is being described by the BBC as a \"a kind of scientific Seven Up [the classic documentary series that followed a group of children over seven-year intervals]\". </p> <p>Of course, the whole thing may never last 20 years at all. The series might simply discover at what age children achieve the cognitive awareness and linguistic skills necessary to tell a fly-on-the-wall cameraman exactly where he can shove his Sony Digi Beta. But using television as a kind of social science laboratory where we, the viewers, can drop in and out to see how the child born into a working-class family in Cardiff is developing in comparison to the child of a middle-class family in Manchester, has never been more popular. </p> <p>Producers of such programmes are only too aware that they are creating source material for historians, sociologists and psychologists of the future. Stephen Lambert, executive producer of ITV's <strong>Many Happy Returns</strong>, prefers the term \"longitudinal studies\" for his programmes. Many Happy Returns, a variation on the Seven Up series, will follow 10 children through their lives, returning every five years to catch up with them as they celebrate their birthdays. \"It's not a social science experiment in the sense that with ten children you're not going to choose a group that represents the nation,\" says Lambert, \"but there is a gender mix and a class mix and a geographical mix.\" </p> <p>There is, of course, no shortage of people willing to put themselves, or to put their children, under television's sociological spotlight for such programmes. \"We're hoping it won't be too disruptive to their family life but... this is about as intrusive as it gets\", said a BBC spokesperson for the A Child Of Our Time project. </p> <p>Lambert certainly found no lack of would-be participants for Many Happy Returns. \"At least 400 children were interviewed by the production team\", he says. Perhaps one reason why so many people are keen to be part of \"longitudinal studies\" series like this is that it gives the participants more control over how they're portrayed than a one-off documentary. \"Usually once you've finished filming with people their sense of control is much less because they've made their contribution, but with these programmes you have to ensure that the people that have been in the programmes like them each time because they've got to be willing to take part the next time.\" </p> <p>If having your life interrupted by a a film crew every five years or so seems intrusive, then what about being filmed every day for a year? Later this month the BBC begins <strong>Castaway 2000</strong>, a documentary following 36 people left on the deserted island of Taransay, off the coast of Scotland, for a year - though last night several of them were reported to have been airlifted off the island because of flu. Again, literally hundreds of people applied to be human guinea pigs in front of millions of viewers. </p> <p>Jeremy Mills, executive producer for Lion TV of the BBC Scotland production, is quite clear about the programme's aim to create a televisual laboratory. \"Yes it is a social experiment\", he says. \"The essence of it is that we try to get people who reflect British society, put them together in a situation where they're away from the normal things that impinge on daily life, and let them reflect on what it is they miss about the lives they've left behind and how they work together as a team and decide what the rules of the new community are.\" </p> <p>It may sound like Crystal Maze meets the Open University Psychology Course (Units 1-3), but Mills makes no apologies for the programme's ambitions. \"We're trying to take our knowledge of where we are as a society and try and move it on to where we could go if we had different options.\" Blimey. At least this sort of programming can't be accused of docu-soap style \"dumbing down\". Castaways has legions of psychologists, sociologists, economists, alternative technologists, sewage experts and survival experts advising the programme makers on the parameters of their experiment. \"They will be involved in monitoring it throughout and involved academically afterwards\", says Mills. And when these programmes are finished they're not only guaranteed to lend some gravitas to the broadcasters - they're invariably mentioned in self-congratulatory end-of-term reports - but they can have a shelf life in the educational and academic market too. </p> <p>So the next time someone offers you 15 minutes of fame if you'll get your knob out for Denise Van Outen, try holding out for a six-part series exploring the socio-psycho-cultural dynamics of the next 15 years in your life.</p>",

Lambert certainly found no lack of would-be participants for Many Happy Returns. \"At least 400 children were interviewed by the production team\", he says. Perhaps one reason why so many people are keen to be part of \"longitudinal studies\" series like this is that it gives the participants more control over how they're portrayed than a one-off documentary. \"Usually once you've finished filming with people their sense of control is much less because they've made their contribution, but with these programmes you have to ensure that the people that have been in the programmes like them each time because they've got to be willing to take part the next time.\" If having your life interrupted by a a film crew every five years or so seems intrusive, then what about being filmed every day for a year? Later this month the BBC begins Castaway 2000, a documentary following 36 people left on the deserted island of Taransay, off the coast of Scotland, for a year - though last night several of them were reported to have been airlifted off the island because of flu. Again, literally hundreds of people applied to be human guinea pigs in front of millions of viewers. Jeremy Mills, executive producer for Lion TV of the BBC Scotland production, is quite clear about the programme's aim to create a televisual laboratory. \"Yes it is a social experiment\", he says. \"The essence of it is that we try to get people who reflect British society, put them together in a situation where they're away from the normal things that impinge on daily life, and let them reflect on what it is they miss about the lives they've left behind and how they work together as a team and decide what the rules of the new community are.\" It may sound like Crystal Maze meets the Open University Psychology Course (Units 1-3), but Mills makes no apologies for the programme's ambitions. \"We're trying to take our knowledge of where we are as a society and try and move it on to where we could go if we had different options.\" Blimey. At least this sort of programming can't be accused of docu-soap style \"dumbing down\". Castaways has legions of psychologists, sociologists, economists, alternative technologists, sewage experts and survival experts advising the programme makers on the parameters of their experiment. \"They will be involved in monitoring it throughout and involved academically afterwards\", says Mills. And when these programmes are finished they're not only guaranteed to lend some gravitas to the broadcasters - they're invariably mentioned in self-congratulatory end-of-term reports - but they can have a shelf life in the educational and academic market too. So the next time someone offers you 15 minutes of fame if you'll get your knob out for Denise Van Outen, try holding out for a six-part series exploring the socio-psycho-cultural dynamics of the next 15 years in your life.",

William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet (Baz Luhrmann, 1996) 3.05am, Sky Premier Luhrmann's vibrant, postmodern reading of the star-cross'd lovers may treat the immortal text like a redundant Joe Eszterhas script, but nevertheless invests it with a frantic immediacy, piling on one high-energy, vividly shot scene after another. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are no great shakes at the verse, but they quiver with earnest mutual passion, and there are some fine support acts - Brian Dennehy's Montague, Pete Postlethwaite's Friar, Miriam Margolyes's nurse and John Leguizamo, whose Tybalt looks like he could eat DiCaprio for breakfast.",

When Cannonball was working in the Miles Davis Quintet, Nat was partnering jazz celebrities, including the bop trombone virtuoso JJ Johnson, and appearing in Woody Herman's bands. When the Miles Davis group went through one of its periodic reinventions - after the Kind Of Blue album - the Adderleys reconvened as a partnership, and delivered a popular brand of blues and gospel-influenced bebop. Over the next decade it was one of the few incarnations of jazz to compete for visceral appeal with rock 'n' roll.</p> <p>During this fruitful association, Nat Adderley wrote several staples of the repertoire that became classics of the idiom later dubbed \"soul-jazz\" - most famously Work Song, but also Jive Samba and Hummin'. The brothers also worked on a musical dedicated to the folk hero John Henry (Shout Up A Morning), which was performed at Carnegie Hall in 1976, and on Broadway a decade later.</p> <p>After Cannonball's death Nat ran his own group, keeping faith with the open style they had explored together, and including such Cannonball-aware alto saxophonists as Sonny Fortune and Vincent Herring. He continued as a bandleader (and periodically a teacher, taking seminars at Harvard and elsewhere) until 1997, when the diabetes that ended his life began to undermine his health.</p> <p>Adderley is survived by his wife, Ann, a son, daughter, and five grandchildren.</p> <p>\u0095 Nathaniel 'Nat' Adderley, jazz musician, born November 25 1931; died January 2 2000</p>",

When Cannonball was working in the Miles Davis Quintet, Nat was partnering jazz celebrities, including the bop trombone virtuoso JJ Johnson, and appearing in Woody Herman's bands. When the Miles Davis group went through one of its periodic reinventions - after the Kind Of Blue album - the Adderleys reconvened as a partnership, and delivered a popular brand of blues and gospel-influenced bebop. Over the next decade it was one of the few incarnations of jazz to compete for visceral appeal with rock 'n' roll. During this fruitful association, Nat Adderley wrote several staples of the repertoire that became classics of the idiom later dubbed \"soul-jazz\" - most famously Work Song, but also Jive Samba and Hummin'. The brothers also worked on a musical dedicated to the folk hero John Henry (Shout Up A Morning), which was performed at Carnegie Hall in 1976, and on Broadway a decade later. After Cannonball's death Nat ran his own group, keeping faith with the open style they had explored together, and including such Cannonball-aware alto saxophonists as Sonny Fortune and Vincent Herring. He continued as a bandleader (and periodically a teacher, taking seminars at Harvard and elsewhere) until 1997, when the diabetes that ended his life began to undermine his health. Adderley is survived by his wife, Ann, a son, daughter, and five grandchildren. \u0095 Nathaniel 'Nat' Adderley, jazz musician, born November 25 1931; died January 2 2000",

The scale of the former Greater London Council leader's victory, in a poll involving nearly 20,000 TGWU political levy-payers in the capital, is likely to cause the greatest alarm in the Labour party's Millbank headquarters and Downing Street. It raises the spectre of a Livingstone victory despite Mr Dobson's huge lead among Labour MPs and MEPs. Mr Livingstone, whose candidacy is strongly opposed by the prime minister, secured 15,858 votes - 85.8% of the total.

Next week, six members of another union that is being excluded from the contest, the technical staff union MSF, will challenge Millbank's decision in the high court. The six include Jim Mortimer, the former general secretary of the Labour party. Whatever the outcome, supporters of Mr Dobson hope that when individual London Labour party members are faced with their ballot papers later this month, they will decline to support an MP who is so mistrusted by the party leadership.

But, in 1956, he attacked Tony Benn as a \"treacherous defeatist\" and \"Nasser's little lackey\" for opposing the Suez invasion.

Then, in 1965, he voted for the pro-Commonwealth Reginald Maudling, rather than the pro-European Heath, in the Tory leadership contest. When Maudling was made Heath's Commonwealth spokesman, he named Braine as his deputy, and he was a strong objector to sanctions after Ian Smith proclaimed the independence of Rhodesia's white minority.</p> <p>When Heath unexpectedly won the 1970 election, he made Braine deputy chairman of the commonwealth parliamentary association, with an automatic knighthood after two years - but it was poor consolation for no ministerial post.</p> <p>Braine immersed himself in backbench battles and tried to make himself more attractive to Heath, proclaiming in 1971 that \"the rejection of the European opportunity would be unforgivable\". But the 1972-73 immigration scares caused by the Uganda Asians crisis, just as entry for EC nationals was easing, showed where Braine's heart lay. In the tightening of immigration rules against the Commonwealth, he became the \"leader of the Old Commonwealth loyalists\", as the Sunday Times dubbed him, insisting on special rights for \"patrials\", the descendants of British emigrants.</p> <p>With Labour back in power in 1974, Braine's eruptions began again after the Flixborough disaster, when Labour's environment secretary, Tony Crosland, told him that the same explosive chemical was stored on Canvey Island. He also became a high-profile anti-abortionist, and, as chairman of the National Council on Alcoholism, talked out a 1976 attempt to ease licensing hours and provide family rooms in pubs. His aggressive and unctuous style began to invite deflation. He was not, joked the Sunday Express, \"the Braine of Britain\".</p> <p>Long before the Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982, he was the islands' fiercest defender, and in his last decade in the Commons, when Mrs Thatcher made him a privy councillor, he touched all his usual bases. He opposed Stansted airport, voted against Sunday trading, and was the only Tory to vote against liberalising pub licensing laws. As consultant to the Police Superintendents' Association, he opposed all suggestions that the police were racist. His last act in the Commons in 1992 was to vote to ban hunting with hounds.</p> <p>At the farewell for retiring MPs, the speaker, Sir Bernard Weatherill, told of his first encounter with Braine. After establishing they were the only two Bernards in the House, Weatherill showed him a motion he was tabling, soliciting Braine's support. Braine borrowed the motion. Returning after some time, he told Weatherill he had secured some publicity. Weatherill sought the story in the next day's newspapers. \"And do you know,\" he recalled, \"I was not the Bernard who was mentioned.\"</p> <p>Braine's wife of 47 years, Kathleen, died in 1982.

When Maudling was made Heath's Commonwealth spokesman, he named Braine as his deputy, and he was a strong objector to sanctions after Ian Smith proclaimed the independence of Rhodesia's white minority. When Heath unexpectedly won the 1970 election, he made Braine deputy chairman of the commonwealth parliamentary association, with an automatic knighthood after two years - but it was poor consolation for no ministerial post. Braine immersed himself in backbench battles and tried to make himself more attractive to Heath, proclaiming in 1971 that \"the rejection of the European opportunity would be unforgivable\". But the 1972-73 immigration scares caused by the Uganda Asians crisis, just as entry for EC nationals was easing, showed where Braine's heart lay. In the tightening of immigration rules against the Commonwealth, he became the \"leader of the Old Commonwealth loyalists\", as the Sunday Times dubbed him, insisting on special rights for \"patrials\", the descendants of British emigrants. With Labour back in power in 1974, Braine's eruptions began again after the Flixborough disaster, when Labour's environment secretary, Tony Crosland, told him that the same explosive chemical was stored on Canvey Island. He also became a high-profile anti-abortionist, and, as chairman of the National Council on Alcoholism, talked out a 1976 attempt to ease licensing hours and provide family rooms in pubs. His aggressive and unctuous style began to invite deflation. He was not, joked the Sunday Express, \"the Braine of Britain\". Long before the Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982, he was the islands' fiercest defender, and in his last decade in the Commons, when Mrs Thatcher made him a privy councillor, he touched all his usual bases. He opposed Stansted airport, voted against Sunday trading, and was the only Tory to vote against liberalising pub licensing laws. As consultant to the Police Superintendents' Association, he opposed all suggestions that the police were racist. His last act in the Commons in 1992 was to vote to ban hunting with hounds. At the farewell for retiring MPs, the speaker, Sir Bernard Weatherill, told of his first encounter with Braine. After establishing they were the only two Bernards in the House, Weatherill showed him a motion he was tabling, soliciting Braine's support. Braine borrowed the motion. Returning after some time, he told Weatherill he had secured some publicity. Weatherill sought the story in the next day's newspapers. \"And do you know,\" he recalled, \"I was not the Bernard who was mentioned.\" Braine's wife of 47 years, Kathleen, died in 1982. He is survived by three sons. \u0095 Bernard Richard Braine, Lord Braine of Wheatley, politician, born June 24 1914; died January 5 2000",

Senior lamas from the Tibetan exile community have confirmed that 14-year-old Urgyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa, accompanied by a small group of monks, slipped past his guards at Tsurphu monastery on December 28. The party walked across rugged mountain terrain to reach northern India yesterday morning. The young Karmapa has joined the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala. Urgyen Trinley Dorje was born into a nomad family in the village of Bakor in eastern Tibet on June 26 1985, four years after the death of the 16th Karmapa, who fled to India following the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Magical manifestations, including triple suns, rainbows and unearthly music, are said to have occurred as the present Karmapa was born. He was recognised by the Dalai Lama in 1992 and subsequently enthroned at Tsurphu monastery, in an elaborate ceremony sanctioned by the Chinese authorities and attended by thousands of Tibetans. While the flight of the young Karmapa - head of the rich and powerful Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism - is a cause for joy among the tens of thousands of Kagyu disciples in the west, it is deeply embarrassing to the Chinese and a major setback to Beijing's campaign to divide Tibetan allegiances. Richard Oppenheimer of the London-based Tibet Information Network said a severe security crackdown appeared inevitable. \"The Chinese have always promoted the 17th Karmapa as a pro-Chinese patriotic figure and they have made a point of trying to drive a wedge between him and the Dalai Lama,\" he said.

No more were the amateur doctors of the world media going to comment on his stiff, puffy appearance, his slurred speech, or what happened to the Hilton's vodka.</p> <p>Yet there were subtle reminders that this was, in the end, a consolation trip for a man who was exiting the world's political stage and unsure what to do next. The occasion was the Russian Orthodox Christmas, and in making his first trip to the Holy Land the first president was reviving an ancient tradition of Christian rulers who made pilgrimages to Jerusalem to atone for the sins of their reigns.</p> <p>His future in the political background was foreshadowed in the tributes that followed him. \"Whatever state he was in, however bad his mood, he was always respectful towards the press,\" reminisced Boris Grishchenko, veteran Yeltsin-follower, for Interfax news agency. Close to tears, he added: \"Gorbachev always used to address us with the familiar 'thou', but Yeltsin always called us 'you'.\"</p> <p>The Israeli interior minister and former Soviet refusenik, Natan Sharansky, who sat next to Mr Yeltsin's wife Naina at Mr Weizman's banquet, reached back into the past to say: \"In the end he was the man who, in a critical moment for Russia, stood on a tank and defended democracy.\"</p> <p>Mr Yeltsin is 68. Most of the world expected him to be carried out of the Kremlin feet first, and now he finds himself with time on his hands. Earlier this week his daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, said he would follow the Gorbachev retirement path: create a foundation, set up a library and employ researchers. He would visit the world, she added.</p> <p>\"He's seen practically nothing,\" she said. \"I sometimes say to him: 'Do you remember how we saw something at such-and-such a place?' And he replies he doesn't. Well, how was he supposed to see anything out of a car window?\"</p> <p>But it was Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, speaking before Mr Yeltsin's departure for Israel, who gave the most candid account of the former leader's anxiety as he contemplated the future.</p> <p>\"He spoke of it with a certain sadness, even fear,\" said Mr Putin. \"The way I understand it is that he can't imagine what else you can do if you've been the president of Russia.</p> <p>\"Maybe he'll be angry with me for saying this, but it is as though he found it a problem - he asked me, and thought out loud, and said: 'It is clear for me that the time has come. But it isn't clear what I, personally, should do next.'\"</p>",

Yet there were subtle reminders that this was, in the end, a consolation trip for a man who was exiting the world's political stage and unsure what to do next. The occasion was the Russian Orthodox Christmas, and in making his first trip to the Holy Land the first president was reviving an ancient tradition of Christian rulers who made pilgrimages to Jerusalem to atone for the sins of their reigns. His future in the political background was foreshadowed in the tributes that followed him. \"Whatever state he was in, however bad his mood, he was always respectful towards the press,\" reminisced Boris Grishchenko, veteran Yeltsin-follower, for Interfax news agency. Close to tears, he added: \"Gorbachev always used to address us with the familiar 'thou', but Yeltsin always called us 'you'.\" The Israeli interior minister and former Soviet refusenik, Natan Sharansky, who sat next to Mr Yeltsin's wife Naina at Mr Weizman's banquet, reached back into the past to say: \"In the end he was the man who, in a critical moment for Russia, stood on a tank and defended democracy.\" Mr Yeltsin is 68. Most of the world expected him to be carried out of the Kremlin feet first, and now he finds himself with time on his hands. Earlier this week his daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, said he would follow the Gorbachev retirement path: create a foundation, set up a library and employ researchers. He would visit the world, she added. \"He's seen practically nothing,\" she said. \"I sometimes say to him: 'Do you remember how we saw something at such-and-such a place?' And he replies he doesn't. Well, how was he supposed to see anything out of a car window?\" But it was Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, speaking before Mr Yeltsin's departure for Israel, who gave the most candid account of the former leader's anxiety as he contemplated the future. \"He spoke of it with a certain sadness, even fear,\" said Mr Putin. \"The way I understand it is that he can't imagine what else you can do if you've been the president of Russia. \"Maybe he'll be angry with me for saying this, but it is as though he found it a problem - he asked me, and thought out loud, and said: 'It is clear for me that the time has come. But it isn't clear what I, personally, should do next.'\"",

The four-member Shackleton 2000 expedition will attempt to follow the exact route taken by the British explorer when he took to small boats after his vessel, the Endurance, was crushed in pack ice and sank in November 1915. His voyage is regarded as one of the greatest survival feats of the 20th century. The current expedition has been mounted by the German adventurer Arved Fuchs, 46, and his crew: Martin Friederichs, also from Germany; Sigridur Ragna Sverrisdottir, from Iceland; and Henryk Wolski, from Poland. The three men and one woman will set out in an exact replica of Shackleton's 6.7m (22ft) wooden boat, the James Caird, which will be dropped from the German cruise ship Hanseatic into the icy Weddel sea in the Antarctic next week. The Hanseatic left the southern Argentine port of Ushuaia yesterday with the Fuchs team and their boat. The expedition will start at the point where killer whales and disintegrating pack ice forced Shackleton to undertake his legendary voyage in April 1916 after he and his crew had spent six months marooned on the ice, sleeping in tents and living off seal and penguin meat. \"Our aim is to show just what a feat Shackleton's journey was,\" said Mr Fuchs. \"So far nobody has managed to complete the whole trip.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After weeks of festive gluttony, you may not feel like thinking about food, let alone salivating over what'll be big in 2000. But in this fashion-conscious age, you could risk social death if you order the wrong wine or sprinkle the wrong vinegar on your salad. So, read on if you want to know what's hip this year.</p> <p>We'll begin with something light. This year, apparently, we shall mostly be eating wildly expensive salad leaves. Which kind, exactly, is unclear: some lettuce aficionados claim that \"landcress\" will replace rocket in stylish salad bowls, while others have their money on tatsoi (a baby Chinese leaf). According to Sainsbury's, the well-dressed leaf, wherever it's from, will be wearing Sabba - concentrated, fermented grape juice.</p> <p>Waitrose disagrees: verjus, it says, is the thing (the juice of unripe grapes: sharp, fruity, but less bitter than vinegar). Luckily, when it comes to tomatoes, the message is clear: TV chef Anthony Worrall Thompson, insists we'll all bin the sundried and be eating sunblushed tomatoes instead (\"Somewhere between sundried and cooked,\" he explains).</p> <p>The really big tip for 2000, though, is fennel, because, according to Jeremy Lee, chef at the Blueprint Caf\u00e9: \"Fennel is the new beetroot.\" If your beetroot is still languishing in a dollop of salad cream on a limp lettuce leaf, don't panic: it could become retro chic at any minute because this year, old is the new new (do try to keep up). The trendiest vegetable will, says Lee, be the potato. \"People will start caring about what variety of potato they're cooking, not just grabbing some from a sack in Sainsbury's.\"</p> <p>Worrall Thompson concurs: \"There's going to be a British food revival,\" he says. \"It's a continuation of the fishcake syndrome: comfort food that mums don't cook any more.\" According to Worrall Thompson, and his colleague Gary Rhodes, 2000 is all about simplicity.</p> <p>However, we may not just be eating scotch eggs and shepherd's pies this year. Many predict that Middle Eastern food will blossom (don't panic, Italian is here to stay too, though regional variation is key). Nigella Lawson says that we've been told this so many times that \"even the prophecy is outdated\".</p> <p>But some insist that pomegranates will be everywhere. If you don't know what to do with those pink, pippy things buy pekmez for your salad dressing - a sweet, sticky, slightly bitter Turkish syrup (it can also be made of grapes or dates). There's also Lebanese pomegranate molasses (stocked by Sainsbury's) and simple pomegranate juice; or you can just scatter the seeds on anything from salads to game and duck. Apparently, too, tamarind will replace cardamom, though this is something of a red-herring to my spice rack in which the raciest thing is a bottle of cayenne.</p> <p>When it comes to meat - brace yourself - there's to be a beef-on-the-bone-ban backlash. Peter Bazeljette, creator of BBC's Ready Steady Cook and the Food and Drink programme says: \"We, as a nation, have a healthy scepticism about food prohibitions.\" The ban was, as they say, a red rag to a bull, and consequently Bazeljette predicts a resurgence of \"dangerous\" foods - dark-red beef eaten on the bone, or \"cheese that crawls towards you\". This, of course, contradicts the notion that, this year, health-conscious cooking will be de rigeur, but as Lawson puts it: \"It's what you learn in science: for every action there will be an opposite and equal reaction.\" Supermarkets, therefore, confidently predict a rush on organic and GM-free foods and on low-fat Japanese and Asian ingredients. In this vein, incidentally, Worrall Thompson also expects to see in supermarkets a preponderance of \"probiotic\" foods: things like live yoghurt which supposedly makes you healthier than you were before you ate it.</p> <p>If all this leaves you gasping for a drink, do not, whatever you do, reach for the Chardonnay (it's practically a profanity in the wine world).</p> <p>Cocktails are back this year. Your Greyhound (year 2000 comeback cocktail of choice: mix fresh grapefruit juice, vodka - Polish please - and ice) will be shaken for you by a \"mixologist\" in a youthfully hip cocktail bar.</p> <p>Alternatively you may find yourself lured into an American-style \"microbar\" which brews its own beer on the premises and is staffed by people straight out of Gap adverts (sullen British service is also a thing of the past). If so, chose golden, aromatically hoppy ales; or drink a British or Belgian wheat beer (Hoegarten is still cool) or, where possible, a German one, such as the dark wheat beer Aventinus.</p> <p>Above all, this year, more and more of us - alarmed, perhaps, by microbar mixologists - will stay at home. Most of what we eat there will be snacks and quick-cook meals. Supermarkets predict a boom in meals for one.

      "bodyText": "After weeks of festive gluttony, you may not feel like thinking about food, let alone salivating over what'll be big in 2000. But in this fashion-conscious age, you could risk social death if you order the wrong wine or sprinkle the wrong vinegar on your salad. So, read on if you want to know what's hip this year. We'll begin with something light. This year, apparently, we shall mostly be eating wildly expensive salad leaves. Which kind, exactly, is unclear: some lettuce aficionados claim that \"landcress\" will replace rocket in stylish salad bowls, while others have their money on tatsoi (a baby Chinese leaf). According to Sainsbury's, the well-dressed leaf, wherever it's from, will be wearing Sabba - concentrated, fermented grape juice. Waitrose disagrees: verjus, it says, is the thing (the juice of unripe grapes: sharp, fruity, but less bitter than vinegar). Luckily, when it comes to tomatoes, the message is clear: TV chef Anthony Worrall Thompson, insists we'll all bin the sundried and be eating sunblushed tomatoes instead (\"Somewhere between sundried and cooked,\" he explains). The really big tip for 2000, though, is fennel, because, according to Jeremy Lee, chef at the Blueprint Caf\u00e9: \"Fennel is the new beetroot.\" If your beetroot is still languishing in a dollop of salad cream on a limp lettuce leaf, don't panic: it could become retro chic at any minute because this year, old is the new new (do try to keep up). The trendiest vegetable will, says Lee, be the potato. \"People will start caring about what variety of potato they're cooking, not just grabbing some from a sack in Sainsbury's.\" Worrall Thompson concurs: \"There's going to be a British food revival,\" he says. \"It's a continuation of the fishcake syndrome: comfort food that mums don't cook any more.\" According to Worrall Thompson, and his colleague Gary Rhodes, 2000 is all about simplicity. However, we may not just be eating scotch eggs and shepherd's pies this year. Many predict that Middle Eastern food will blossom (don't panic, Italian is here to stay too, though regional variation is key). Nigella Lawson says that we've been told this so many times that \"even the prophecy is outdated\". But some insist that pomegranates will be everywhere. If you don't know what to do with those pink, pippy things buy pekmez for your salad dressing - a sweet, sticky, slightly bitter Turkish syrup (it can also be made of grapes or dates). There's also Lebanese pomegranate molasses (stocked by Sainsbury's) and simple pomegranate juice; or you can just scatter the seeds on anything from salads to game and duck. Apparently, too, tamarind will replace cardamom, though this is something of a red-herring to my spice rack in which the raciest thing is a bottle of cayenne. When it comes to meat - brace yourself - there's to be a beef-on-the-bone-ban backlash. Peter Bazeljette, creator of BBC's Ready Steady Cook and the Food and Drink programme says: \"We, as a nation, have a healthy scepticism about food prohibitions.\" The ban was, as they say, a red rag to a bull, and consequently Bazeljette predicts a resurgence of \"dangerous\" foods - dark-red beef eaten on the bone, or \"cheese that crawls towards you\". This, of course, contradicts the notion that, this year, health-conscious cooking will be de rigeur, but as Lawson puts it: \"It's what you learn in science: for every action there will be an opposite and equal reaction.\" Supermarkets, therefore, confidently predict a rush on organic and GM-free foods and on low-fat Japanese and Asian ingredients. In this vein, incidentally, Worrall Thompson also expects to see in supermarkets a preponderance of \"probiotic\" foods: things like live yoghurt which supposedly makes you healthier than you were before you ate it. If all this leaves you gasping for a drink, do not, whatever you do, reach for the Chardonnay (it's practically a profanity in the wine world). Cocktails are back this year. Your Greyhound (year 2000 comeback cocktail of choice: mix fresh grapefruit juice, vodka - Polish please - and ice) will be shaken for you by a \"mixologist\" in a youthfully hip cocktail bar. Alternatively you may find yourself lured into an American-style \"microbar\" which brews its own beer on the premises and is staffed by people straight out of Gap adverts (sullen British service is also a thing of the past). If so, chose golden, aromatically hoppy ales; or drink a British or Belgian wheat beer (Hoegarten is still cool) or, where possible, a German one, such as the dark wheat beer Aventinus. Above all, this year, more and more of us - alarmed, perhaps, by microbar mixologists - will stay at home. Most of what we eat there will be snacks and quick-cook meals. Supermarkets predict a boom in meals for one. It's not that we'll all suddenly become single, just that families in 2000 will rarely eat together (ironic, given the British home-cooking revival). Still, gastronomy will continue to thrive as a hobby (though not an everyday practice). The dinner party is dead, so you won't be able to throw one, (you haven't been paying attention, have you?), but you can invite a couple of mates round for steak-and-kidney pud. Be sure, though, to wash it down with Chilean red wine (more flavanols: they protect against cancer) or a malbec from Argentina. Or indeed anything organic and red (white will be less popular) that you've ordered over the internet. There will, incidentally, be a better choice of organic wines, though an explosion is unlikely as it takes three years for a vineyard to be certified organic. What's more, according to Suzy Atkins, co-editor of Which? Wine Guide 2000, those brave enough to overcome memories of retsina will be pleasantly surprised by modern Greek wines. Finally, licensing laws may at last be changed this year.

The biggest seller was the chain's own-label \u00a310.99 fizz, followed by popular brands such as Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and Lanson. The best vintages had sold out by the beginning of December. </p> <p>Overall sales of wine and beer in the chain were ahead 22.1% in November and December. Chief executive Tim How said: \"We saw both a good increase in transactions and a willingness to spend more, with the average customer spend up 14%.\" </p> <p>AIM-listed pubs group Honeycombe Leisure pronounced millennium eve \"a great success\". Like-for-like sales over the festive period were up some 6%, and chief executive James Baer said: \"It was certainly the right decision to open our sites for the millennium and not take the easy option of closing.\" </p> <p>Nightclub operator Chorion, whose outlets include London mega-club Tiger Tiger, said its like-for-like sales were up 55% on 1998 levels after a December of hard celebrating. Chorion operates six West End clubs and sales at Tiger Tiger, which also includes a cocktail bar and restaurant, were up 96%. </p> <p>SFI, whose bars and pubs include the Bar Med and Litten Tree chains, entertained 10,000 drinkers on the big night, who spent an average \u00a350 a head and generated SFI's highest one-day sales - even though only two-thirds of its outlets were open.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first indications of the extent of the toasting that greeted the new millennium is emerging from drinks retailers and nightclubs. Wine warehouse group Majestic yesterday confirmed seasonal champagne sales up 73% on last year, with the emphasis on quantity rather than quality. The biggest seller was the chain's own-label \u00a310.99 fizz, followed by popular brands such as Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and Lanson. The best vintages had sold out by the beginning of December. Overall sales of wine and beer in the chain were ahead 22.1% in November and December. Chief executive Tim How said: \"We saw both a good increase in transactions and a willingness to spend more, with the average customer spend up 14%.\" AIM-listed pubs group Honeycombe Leisure pronounced millennium eve \"a great success\". Like-for-like sales over the festive period were up some 6%, and chief executive James Baer said: \"It was certainly the right decision to open our sites for the millennium and not take the easy option of closing.\" Nightclub operator Chorion, whose outlets include London mega-club Tiger Tiger, said its like-for-like sales were up 55% on 1998 levels after a December of hard celebrating. Chorion operates six West End clubs and sales at Tiger Tiger, which also includes a cocktail bar and restaurant, were up 96%. SFI, whose bars and pubs include the Bar Med and Litten Tree chains, entertained 10,000 drinkers on the big night, who spent an average \u00a350 a head and generated SFI's highest one-day sales - even though only two-thirds of its outlets were open.",

      "bodyText": "Troubled trade finance group Versailles yesterday denied reports that it had received a takeover bid and confirmed that it was committed to remaining independent. The company is searching for a heavyweight non-executive chairman and a group finance director. Two teams of accountants are combing the group's books - Baker Tilly, on behalf of the London Stock Exchange, and PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of high street banks which are owed \u00a365m - and Versailles still hopes to have its shares relisted by the end of the month. Recent media reports suggested that Fairfax Gerrard, a Slough-based trade finance company, was considering an offer for Versailles, while other market rumours claimed that opportunist bidders were planning to snap up Versailles at a bargain price. But the group, whose shares were suspended on December 8 after it emerged that its turnover may have been inflated by up to one third, said no offer was on the table. Its main bankers - NatWest, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland - remain supportive and the company's founder, the leading black entrepreneur Carl Cushnie, has pledged to step down as chairman to concentrate on the role of chief executive. Versailles is also seeking new financial advisers.",

It claims more than 1m hits on its wholly owned Autobytel UK website since it was set up on April 30 last year. </p> <p>The European offshoot now plans to launch its own web sites in Germany, France and Holland.

      "bodyText": "Is Inchcape, almost as venerable a City institution as the Old Lady herself, about to become a dot.com stock? The self-styled world's largest independent automotive distribution group yesterday headed the leaders of the FTSE-250 players, rising 13% to close at 312.5p - still a way off its year high of 408p but impressive for what was once a low-octane, spluttering mini-conglomerate. The reason, even in a wary market, is simple enough. It paid just $10m (\u00a36m) for a 7.3% stake in Autobytel.Europe, a newly formed subsidiary of a US parent which controls 45% of the American online automotive market. Buying and selling a car or a house in the US is simple enough: you post your details, specifications, price, on the web and wait for offers. But in Europe it is more complex. Groups such as Virgin see growth potential, however. Inchcape - now that it has almost divested itself of its non-motor baggage - sees a large part of its future in online sales of the upmarket range of cars it distributes to showrooms. It claims more than 1m hits on its wholly owned Autobytel UK website since it was set up on April 30 last year. The European offshoot now plans to launch its own web sites in Germany, France and Holland. It points out that the first two of those countries and Britain sell more than 26m new and used cars a year, with numbers of adults online in Europe set to grow from 34m now to 100m by 2003. With Ford building the virtual car assembly plant, all Inchcape has to do to shed its venerable image is find and distribute the virtual car.",

Over the past four decades this immensely accomplished saxophonist has stood out as a musicians' musician, working with many of the big names, including John Mayall, Ronnie Scott, Georgie Fame, Ian Carr, Chris McGregor, Elvin Janes, George Gruntz and Charlie Watts. In the 90s Skidmore has recorded and performed with the likes of Van Morrison and Mose Allison. Words such as passion and virtuoso are freely bandied about when describing Skidmore's sax playing, and this evening his seasoned quartet features the \"mesmerising\" piano playing of Steve Melling, the \"sensual\" and \"captivating\" bass of Arnie Somogyi, and drummer Stephen Keogh's \"profusion of rhythms\". Don't ask for your favourite Coltrane requests, Skidmore and Co's repertoire is based on what they like to play, not what the audience expects.

His duels with Donald, particularly at Trent Bridge, have become among the most famous rivalries in the game.</p> <p>Four years previously it had been principally Atherton's tenacity over 10 hours which had denied South Africa a win at the Wanderers. Donald wanted revenge and believed Atherton to be vulnerable to the fast inswinger early on. </p> <p>The last ball of the first over of the series started outside off stump, swung in viciously and cartwheeled the off stump. It was the most telling delivery of the series, for in that single moment a spectre had been laid to rest. </p> <p><strong>3: Rudi Koertzen's failure to give Mark Boucher out in the first innings in Port Elizabeth</strong> <br> England had shrugged off the defeat at the Wanderers as an aberration and had gone into the second Test in good heart. Hussain won the toss on December 9, put South Africa in and on a good pitch that was getting better watched his bowlers reduce them to 268 for seven early on the second day, with the second new ball imminent. A further wicket and Donald would be at the crease.</p> <p>Lance Klusener and Mark Boucher had then added 26 for the eighth wicket when Andy Caddick found bounce outside off stump, the ball climbing at Boucher, nicking his glove and going through to Alec Stewart behind the stumps. Koertzen shook his head and Boucher survived. </p> <p>Boucher, 11 at the time, made 42. More pertinently Klusener, on 82, went on to reach 174, before South Africa were finally dismissed for 450. With 373 themselves, England had a significant deficit instead of a probable lead. </p> <p><strong>4: Michael Vaughan's damaged finger in East London</strong> <br> After the second Test and the one-day game in Alice, England travelled to East London for a four-day match against a combined Eastern Province-Border side, where they came across a promising young fast bowler called Garnett Kruger, tall and with good pace.</p> <p>On December 19, the second afternoon, Vaughan, not long at the crease, received a ball that bounced unexpectedly from a length and trapped his right forefinger against the bat handle. His immediate reaction was of someone who suspected his finger had been broken and although x-rays showed this was not the case, a scan indicated hairline cracks within the joint. </p> <p>A prognosis that he would be fit for the third Test in Durban proved optimistic and although England held the upper hand for much of that game, the loss of Vaughan disjointed the side. </p> <p><strong>5: Phil Tufnell's no-ball to Gary Kirsten in Durban</strong> <br> The third Test in Durban, which started on Boxing Day, was England's zenith. A first-innings score of 366 for nine was followed by a phenomenal piece of bowling from Caddick, who took seven for 46 as South Africa were bowled out by the third evening for 156. Hussain enforced the follow-on knowing that two hot, debilitating days in the field were in prospect. </p> <p>Approaching lunch on the fourth day, Caddick had removed Herschelle Gibbs but Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis were starting to entrench. Then the left-handed Kirsten went on to the back foot to Tufnell and was beaten by turn into him, the ball striking him on the pad. Even as Tufnell appealed, England began to celebrate: it was plumb. </p> <p>But, unnoticed, the umpire Dave Orchard was signalling that Tufnell had bowled a no-ball, a cardinal sin for a spinner. Kirsten, then 33, went on to make 275, the second-longest innings in Test history, and saw South Africa to safety. England have yet to recover from the ordeal in the field.</p> <p><strong>6: Alec Stewart's dismissal in the first innings in Cape Town</strong> <br> England were well placed on the first day of the fourth Test last Sunday. A good toss had been won and Atherton and Mark Butcher had posted a century opening stand. Although both were caught on the boundary playing adventurous shots, and Hussain was dismissed by Paul Adams, Vaughan and Stewart were progressing nicely as the day drew to a close. </p> <p>At 213 for three it was a time to take stock and capitalise the next day. Stewart is an adrenalin player, however, and not without a streak of machismo. The crowd noise was intense, the bowling from Donald aggressive and the taunting from bowler and fielders incessant, testing his resolve. </p> <p>Stewart should have resisted but, with men placed on the fence, he took on Donald's bouncer and hooked it straight to Kirsten. England finished the day on 215 for five, lost their last seven wickets for 47 and were bowled out in the second innings for 126. Stewart's dismissal was the catalyst.</p>",

      "body": "<p>England's beaten cricketers were yesterday warned that the financial future of the domestic game is dependent on dramatically improved performances. </p> <p>Speaking in the aftermath of the defeat in the Test series against South Africa, Lord MacLaurin, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said that sponsorship would be hard to attract if the national team continued to wallow among the also-rans. </p> <p>\"If you are right at the top of the tree, No1 or 2 in the world,\" he said, \"then sponsorship will come, especially at home, because people love cricket and there is a massive interest. It is just sad that we are where we are at the moment.\" </p> <p>Sponsorship and broadcasting deals provide the bulk of the ECB's income but the board is currently shedding sponsors rather than attracting them. Cornhill, which has spent \u00a328m on home Tests since 1978, has announced that it will pull out at the end of this summer's series, against Zimbabwe and West Indies, and NatWest, which has sponsored the major one-day domestic competition since 1980 as well as playing a significant role in the development of the game, is considering its position. </p> <p>MacLaurin is confident that a replacement for Cornhill will be found, and hopes for an announcement \"sooner rather than later\". But there is a triangular international one-day tournament in England this summer and as yet there is no sponsor. </p> <p>\"We would have hoped to have had one on board by now,\" he said. \"There are two companies negotiating with us. But we have to be good at this most senior level and then we will attract sponsors. Business today is very tough and sponsorship budgets are looked at very closely by companies. They want to sponsor success.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin believes there are signs of an upturn. \"In the last couple of years the First Class Forum and the county chairmen have got a quite clear approach to England being of paramount importance, where before they were more interested in winning the County Championship. </p> <p>\"We have a very good TV deal with Channel 4 and Sky, who are doing a tremendous job, and there are new sponsors for the County Championship and the National League. Both of the sponsors are pleased with the divisional system and now we have to monitor things to see if we have got it right or wrong. There are views that it is still not right, and I respect that. </p> <p>\"One hopes we learn from this tour, and the streamlined management structure of Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher is already earning praise. It would be nice if we could start our comeback by beating Zimbabwe and West Indies before we go to Pakistan and Sri Lanka next winter and then face the Australians again. Despite this result, I think we are starting to see improvements.\"</p>",

It is just sad that we are where we are at the moment.\" Sponsorship and broadcasting deals provide the bulk of the ECB's income but the board is currently shedding sponsors rather than attracting them. Cornhill, which has spent \u00a328m on home Tests since 1978, has announced that it will pull out at the end of this summer's series, against Zimbabwe and West Indies, and NatWest, which has sponsored the major one-day domestic competition since 1980 as well as playing a significant role in the development of the game, is considering its position. MacLaurin is confident that a replacement for Cornhill will be found, and hopes for an announcement \"sooner rather than later\". But there is a triangular international one-day tournament in England this summer and as yet there is no sponsor. \"We would have hoped to have had one on board by now,\" he said. \"There are two companies negotiating with us. But we have to be good at this most senior level and then we will attract sponsors. Business today is very tough and sponsorship budgets are looked at very closely by companies. They want to sponsor success.\" MacLaurin believes there are signs of an upturn. \"In the last couple of years the First Class Forum and the county chairmen have got a quite clear approach to England being of paramount importance, where before they were more interested in winning the County Championship. \"We have a very good TV deal with Channel 4 and Sky, who are doing a tremendous job, and there are new sponsors for the County Championship and the National League. Both of the sponsors are pleased with the divisional system and now we have to monitor things to see if we have got it right or wrong. There are views that it is still not right, and I respect that. \"One hopes we learn from this tour, and the streamlined management structure of Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher is already earning praise. It would be nice if we could start our comeback by beating Zimbabwe and West Indies before we go to Pakistan and Sri Lanka next winter and then face the Australians again. Despite this result, I think we are starting to see improvements.\"",

It has been so for sixty years and more: Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond. Jack Hobbs, 'The Master,' scorer of more first-class runs than anyone in the game, 98 of his 197 centuries made after the age of 40, a dignified and humble man. Len Hutton, whose best years were robbed by the Second World War, and an injury which permanently weakened his left arm, but who still twice subsequently captained England to Ashes wins against Australia. Alongside these two cricketing knights stands Wally Hammond, classically upright at the crease and, according to David Foot's recent biography, a bit of a lad off it as well.</p> <p>Hutton wins the vote ahead of two other famous Yorkshire sons, Herbert Sutcliffe and Geoffrey Boycott, and it can be assumed that neither would be overly impressed.

No English batsman has sold his wicket more dearly. As Australia's 'keeper, Wally Grout, said: \"When Ken walked to the wicket you could see the Union Jack fluttering behind him.\" That leaves Peter May to unfurl his effortless on-drive at No.5; he will probably not captain, and definitely not become chairman of selectors, after his retirement. </p> <p>Lovers of Denis Compton will be appalled but there will only be room for Compo's carefree and charming strokeplay if England opt for a sixth specialist batsman. Cowdrey? A little flabby. Gower? Too lax. It would be nice to pick Randall or Milburn just for the hell of it. Ian Botham is an automatic pick at No.6, the youthful, irrepressible version before injury and the England captaincy subdued his joie de vivre. There has been no more hale and hearty cricketer in England's history. Alan Knott outstrips Godfrey Evans as wicketkeeper. He will score more runs, keep wondrously standing back, and his mild hypochondria will ensure that the dressing room is forever free of draughts.</p> <p>Sydney Barnes could be a cantankerous soul, but many have rated him as the finest of all English bowlers. He had little fondness for county cricket and often returned to the Test side straight from the Leagues. The restructuring of club cricket would have to work miracles for that to be repeated a century later. As a medium-pacer, capable of producing swing, cut and spin, Barnes will have to settle for third seamer. </p> <p>If that creates tension for the captain, Hutton, it will be nothing compared to telling his fellow Yorkshireman, Fred Trueman - by his own estimation \"t'finest bloody fast bowler that ever drew breath\" - that he must bowl uphill and against the wind, so that Frank Tyson can have the pick of ends. Another Yorkie, Wilfred Rhodes, would serve as 12th man, if only on the grounds that he was good for a crisis - this being England, one would be bound to come along eventually.</p> <p>There has to be a surprise selection, so here it is. Off-spinners being out of favour, there is no place for Jim Laker, for all his 19 wickets against Australia in 1956. Instead, all will be gambled on the rhythmical slow left-arm of Colin Blythe. Artistic and highly-strung, his epileptic fits would be less of a worry these days. He found England Tests emotionally trying, so he would slot in pretty well.</p> <p>Knott retains his wicketkeeper's place in the World X1. He is the only Englishman, which at least answers charges of rampant nationalism. Australians, for all that, will remain loyal to Ian Healy.</p> <p>Two more cricketing knights are automatic World X1 selections. Don Bradman is a fixture at No.3. The greatest of all Test batsmen, blessed with a ruthless mind, quick eye and devastating footwork, he would probably waste no time in lifting his Test average from 99.94 to 100. Neville Cardus spoke of how Bradman \"turned the game into an exact science\", and others found his domination so complete that he drained the game of unpredictability. The world's best all-rounder is also incontestable: Gary Sobers, a stylish left-handed batsman, swift fielder and astonishingly versatile left-arm bowler, who could switch from fast-medium to slow left-arm, orthodox or wrist spin, makes the list without difficulty.</p> <p>Gordon Greenidge would have many supporters to fill one of the opening batting slots. But he must give way to his fellow West Indian, George Headley, who dominated the 1930s and whose Test average of 60.83 is unsurpassed in Caribbean cricket. He is partnered by Barry Richards, whose refined strokeplay graced only four Test matches before South Africa's apartheid policies justifiably brought about their ban from international competition. Instead, Richards languished in county cricket, where boredom seemed the commonest cause of his dismissal. In the middle-order, Pakistan's Javed Miandad holds off India's Sachin Tendulkar, largely because Javed, the ultimate streetfighter, has a proven record of producing at times of crisis. The West Indies also provides the No.5, with Viv Richards chosen ahead of Everton Weekes, marginally the best of the 'three W's'. No batsman has ever arrived at the crease with a more imposing swagger.</p> <p>Imran Khan's immense influence upon Pakistani cricket insists that his all-round talents cannot be ignored, although the verve of Keith Miller, and snaking left-arm of Wasim Akram are reluctantly abandoned. Malcolm Marshall, as shrewd as they come, takes the new ball ahead of a posse of magnificent West Indian quicks. He is joined by Australia's Dennis Lillee: courageous, belligerent, hostile, and ultimately a great technician. And yes, the spinner's place can go to Warney, one of the greatest showmen of all - with strict instructions that he has nothing more to do with Indian bookmakers.</p> <p>Everybody would know that this World X1 would be unbeatable anyway.</p> <p><strong>World XI</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> BA Richards (South Africa) b1945 <strong>2</strong> GA Headley (West Indies) b1909 <strong>3</strong> DG Bradman (Australia) b1908 <strong>4</strong> Javed Miandad (Pakistan) b1957 <strong>5</strong> IVA Richards (West Indies) b1952 <strong>6</strong> GSA Sobers (West Indies) b1936 <strong>7</strong> Imran Khan (Pakistan, capt) b1952 <strong>8</strong> APE Knott (England) b1946 <strong>9</strong> SK Warne (Australia) b1969 <strong>10</strong> MD Marshall (West Indies) b1958 <strong>11</strong> DK Lillee (Australia) b 1949</p> <p><strong>12th man: </strong> KR Miller (Australia) b 1919</p> <p><strong>England XI</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> JB Hobbs (Surrey) b1882 <strong>2</strong> L Hutton (Yorkshire, capt) b1916 <strong>3</strong> WR Hammond (Gloucestershire) b1903 <strong>4</strong> KF Barrington (Surrey) b1930 <strong>5</strong> PBH May (Surrey) b1929 <strong>6</strong> IT Botham (Somerset, Worcs, Durham) b1955 <strong>7</strong> APE Knott (Kent) b1946 <strong>8</strong> FS Trueman (Yorkshire) b1931 <strong>9</strong> FH Tyson (Northants) b1930 <strong>10</strong> SF Barnes (Warwicks, Staffs, Lancs) b1873 <strong>11</strong> C Blythe (Kent) b 1879</p> <p><strong>12th man: </strong> W Rhodes (Yorkshire) b1877</p>",

Instead, all will be gambled on the rhythmical slow left-arm of Colin Blythe. Artistic and highly-strung, his epileptic fits would be less of a worry these days. He found England Tests emotionally trying, so he would slot in pretty well. Knott retains his wicketkeeper's place in the World X1. He is the only Englishman, which at least answers charges of rampant nationalism. Australians, for all that, will remain loyal to Ian Healy. Two more cricketing knights are automatic World X1 selections. Don Bradman is a fixture at No.3. The greatest of all Test batsmen, blessed with a ruthless mind, quick eye and devastating footwork, he would probably waste no time in lifting his Test average from 99.94 to 100. Neville Cardus spoke of how Bradman \"turned the game into an exact science\", and others found his domination so complete that he drained the game of unpredictability. The world's best all-rounder is also incontestable: Gary Sobers, a stylish left-handed batsman, swift fielder and astonishingly versatile left-arm bowler, who could switch from fast-medium to slow left-arm, orthodox or wrist spin, makes the list without difficulty. Gordon Greenidge would have many supporters to fill one of the opening batting slots. But he must give way to his fellow West Indian, George Headley, who dominated the 1930s and whose Test average of 60.83 is unsurpassed in Caribbean cricket. He is partnered by Barry Richards, whose refined strokeplay graced only four Test matches before South Africa's apartheid policies justifiably brought about their ban from international competition. Instead, Richards languished in county cricket, where boredom seemed the commonest cause of his dismissal. In the middle-order, Pakistan's Javed Miandad holds off India's Sachin Tendulkar, largely because Javed, the ultimate streetfighter, has a proven record of producing at times of crisis. The West Indies also provides the No.5, with Viv Richards chosen ahead of Everton Weekes, marginally the best of the 'three W's'. No batsman has ever arrived at the crease with a more imposing swagger. Imran Khan's immense influence upon Pakistani cricket insists that his all-round talents cannot be ignored, although the verve of Keith Miller, and snaking left-arm of Wasim Akram are reluctantly abandoned. Malcolm Marshall, as shrewd as they come, takes the new ball ahead of a posse of magnificent West Indian quicks. He is joined by Australia's Dennis Lillee: courageous, belligerent, hostile, and ultimately a great technician. And yes, the spinner's place can go to Warney, one of the greatest showmen of all - with strict instructions that he has nothing more to do with Indian bookmakers. Everybody would know that this World X1 would be unbeatable anyway.

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest pension funds have been warned that they are in danger of breaching secure investment limits if Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann goes ahead. Actuarial consultant Bacon &amp; Woodrow said a deal between Vodafone and Mannesman would leave three firms at the top of the FTSE 100 accounting for about a quarter of the index's total value. At present BP Amoco is worth the equivalent of 7% of the FTSE, BT accounts for another 6% and Vodafone AirTouch about 5.5%. The impact of such huge companies was illustrated yesterday, when another 115p drop in the price of BT's shares to 1,221p accounted for nearly a third of the 88.7 point decline in the index. A very large or protracted underperformance by a single company could now influence the value of retirement pensions some funds might be able to pay. Pension funds were warned last year that the merger of BP Amoco and Arco could leave them critically overexposed to oil stocks in the UK. That added momentum to the formation of new multi-national stock indices on both sides of the Atlantic which are attempting to restore the balance of the market. These indices - which are backed by some of the most substantial pension funds, such as Sainsbury's - attempt to group together companies which earn most of their money overseas, rather than grouping organisations simply in terms of size. This attempts to avoid some problems of geographic concentration such as occurred when BP acquired Amoco and then Arco, both of whose shares were listed in the United States but which are now accounted for in the home market of their new parent. The founders of the global indices say there is some evidence that those pension funds which are investing in the new markets belong to companies that are themselves multinationals, and pursuing a strategy of international investment. Most investment management consultants argue that funds should not have more than 5% of their money in any one stock, but a large number of British pension funds are thought to have broken through that limit. The trend towards corporate gigantism and globalism is apparent in stock markets around the world, and has created imbalances in Ireland and Finland where mobile telephone group Nokia, Europe's biggest company, is based. But the investment issues for British pension funds are particularly accute, because they tend to have a higher proportion of their money invested in the domestic market than do their overseas peers. At the end of September they had more than 72% of their funds invested in shares and some 54% invested in the British stock market. The investment pattern of index tracker funds, which buy shares in proportion to the overall market and are believed to own one in every five shares, is thought to be fuelling the UK's investment concentration. \"This is still very much an issue,\" said one B&amp;W executive. \"We are concerned about the level of concentration and the holding of too few stocks which UK pension funds have. \"We recommend that funds do not have more than 5% of their total money in any one company, but some of the positions which active fund managers are taking will clearly be breaching this type of limit. \"We and most other fund consultants are trying to avoid our clients suffering a significant setback relative to the rest of the market if they are tracking an index or benchmark.\"",
